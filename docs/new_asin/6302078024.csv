422808,4,6302078024,"Excellent movie that kept my attention start to finish.  I had just finished reading the non-fiction book by the man who came up with the scheme.  The movie departs from the book in several important respects but it does make a more dramatic tale and most of the major parts are accurate. In other words, the movie is not a documentary but a retelling of a fascinating episode in the great conflict of World War II.  For an accurate account, read the book, despite the fact that the author had to omit some information for security reasons.  Very intriguing to read online that they are still arguing about the true identity of the corpse.

One criticism I might make is that Pam, the secretary in the super-secret operation, needs to memorize 'loose lips sink ships'.  Hard to believe she would be so indiscreet tho it moved the plot along, I suppose.

Must also note that I'm a big fan of Joan Dickson who played Agatha Christie's Miss Marple for years yet I could not spot her in the movie.  I had to go to IMDB to identify her.",1501200000,,1031,4.446808510638298

422876,4,6302078024,"PLOT: plant fake info on a deadman and let the Nazis filnd him.

British Military Intelligence come up with a great idea. Plant' fake invasion plans' on a dead man and allow the Nazis to find him. The scheme begins with a Nazi Agent in Spain who will find the ""body"" a carefully ""Invented"" person named William Martin. Martin is a corpse dressed in military uniform with  fake ids of Martin along with a briefcase stuff with Top Secret Invasion Plans. All completely false, right down to a girlfriend and love letters. the brilliant scheme was an actual World War 2 plot. As ""Martin"" preserved in dry ice is released at sea by a British Sub....he ends up in Spain....as plotted by tide currents and his Papers marked Top Secret~ had been opened and resealed. Soon the Nazis move their reserves to Greece.....when the actual invasion was to take place in Italy. But a Nazi spy is sent to England to look up the girl in the photo Martin carried in his wallet....(a Brunette) Audrey Trotter. This is a interesting movie. Webb is the head plotter of the scheme and lovely Gloria Graham is his secretary and Trotter her flat mate. Trotter is the most interesting of the movie who is WAY over the top in acting but helps hold the plot and moves it along.

422905,3,6302078024,"No question war, especially World War II, is an especially fertile ground for thrillers, for the portrayal of the best laid plans of mice or men, going awry or not. Even better, again using World War II as the example, is the role that anonymous individual have in turning battles or other events one way or the other and turning history that way on a dime. Of course as in the film under review, The Man Who Never Was once even the most interesting real life plan has to be glossed enough to be audience-friendly and so certain liberties give the whole plot grander effect that the normal ho-hum of intelligence work really looks like. Ask your nearest clandestine spy and he or she will give you the real skinny.

Here what is what on this one. The British (and Allies) after clearing North Africa and its environs of Jerries, oops German, by 1943 are ready to make their way to back to Europe by setting up a second front via Sicily and eventually to Italy and then eastward. The deal though is the Germans are entrenched on Sicily and elsewhere and since they are prepared for some kind of invasion from the South they would if at full strength make the Allied casualty lists even longer. So somebody in Naval Intelligence, a staff officer played by Clifton Webb last seen in this space trying to corner the Gene Tierney market in the film noir Laura, proposed the idea of trying to fake the Germans into thinking that the invasion was going to come through Greece, or elsewhere thus diverging those German divisions elsewhere. A hard trick to pull off, no question since the Germans had not conquered a good part of Europe by being duped by every harebrained scheme the enemy came up with. But our captain is clever and resourceful. Why not have a dead man volunteer (by his grieving but patriotic father) filled with war plans and personal items be washed up on the Spanish coast and see if the Germans buy the ruse. The rest of the film, and the films tension, revolves around getting everything right to fool the Germans from real letters to sales receipts from mens clothing stores.

And it mainly works. But like I said the Germans were not born yesterday and so they sent a spy into Britain to get the scoop on this dead body. As the spy gets more information he becomes convinced that this plans found on the dead body are real. The icing on the cake, and the reason that Gloria Grahame last seen here in this space as a gangsters moll in half the great B-noirs of the late 1940s and early 1950s, gets some top billing despite her small role is that when the spy goes to her to see her reaction to the death of the dead man who was supposed to be her fianc she puts on a convincing demonstration for him, although she was mourning the fly-boy she was engaged to who was killed in a plane  crash. Nice twist. Nice to that an individual did have a small effect on the outcome of World War II with all the mass deaths and destruction.",1455494400,,2943,4.42619926199262

422954,4,6302078024,"The spy game has always been an interest of mine. While in 7th grade I remember reading the book 'The Man Who Never Was', and I was fascinated with the reality. I had read all of the Nancy Drew books in the 3rd and 4 th grades. Now, I was on to the big time. For whatever reason I had not seen the 1956 film, probably too young at the time,but as time went on, I forgot the classic.

In 1943, British counter-intelligence agent Ewen Montagu posited a plan to mislead the Germans into thinking the next landing would occur in Greece. The real plan was to invade Sicily. Even Montagu had to convince everyone and look at every detail for this plan to work. He even had to enlist the work of his secretary's best friend to write a love letter. The plot was so inventive and so simple that's it had to go to the top before it was OK'ed.

A dead body, dressed as a Royal Marine officer and carrying false information was to wash up on a Spanish shore near the town of a known Nazi agent. The body was found, the information and all details looked at and collected, all under the strictest of silence. Essentially, Ewen Montagu created a man who never existed. William Martin, the Marine was brought by submarine to the shores of the Spanish town. from thence forth, all was expected to fall into place.

Clifton Web plays Ewen Montagu, a man with one thing on his mind, work, seldom smiled, stiff as a board. He rarely gave compliments, it must have been all work and no laughs in this office. Gloria Graham plays the secretary's best friend who writes the convincing letter to her fianc&eacute;e. She does a credible job, but I did have to smile at times at the incredible intensity of all of the characters.

Do view this film to see how it all acts out, and go view te characters and actors. Very intense music is the highlight, and you will finish the film wondering what just happened.

422995,5,6302078024,"Anyone interested in an absorbing wartime spy story, particularly devotees of 1950s British cinema, should not miss the digitally re-mastered version of ""The Man Who Never Was"" on Blu-ray. The excellent restoration, in original 2.35.1 aspect ration and decent LPCM audio, constitutes the best presentation of this minor classic for home entertainment.

Based on a real military operation, the plot concerns the ingenious use of a dead man, given the identity of a Royal Marines officer, to deceive the Germans about allied intentions before the invasion of Sicily in 1943. So is created Major William Martin and his story goes on from there. The actual operation, codenamed ""Mincemeat,"" was conceived from an idea suggested by a young naval intelligence lieutenant named Ian Fleming, who later went on to write the James Bond novels.

Clifton Webb, as Lt. Commander Montagu, leads a strong cast of British character actors along with a coldly smooth Stephen Boyd as an Irish enemy agent and Gloria Graeme, the love interest.

423026,5,6302078024,"The highlights of the book are here. However different people are get credit the different actions and thoughts than in the book.

The first half of the movie is about solving a problem of how to make the Germans in 1943 think that the invasion will take place in Portugal instead of in Sicily. If they can move just one gun or a troop they can save lives. The solution is described as barbaric and unique.

The second half of the movie is to keep the Germans from finding out the deception. They have gone trough elaborate efforts to manufacture a false identity for a currier. The Germans are interested if him and send in a spy (Steven Boyd) to find out his past.

One of the most telling scenes is while there are preparing the deception and are in a bunker you hear the bombs and screams that remind you of the urgency and purpose of the movie.

Clifton Webb is Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu, the person that the movie evolves around. Gloria Grahame plays Lucy Sherwood, an alleged girlfriend. The reason she shines is that they put a lot of grease on her face and it shines in the dark.

If you saw Ben-Hur then you may recognize Messala (Steven Boyd) as the spy sent to be sure that Martin is genuine.

And if you are an Agatha Christie Miss Marple fan you will see that Joan Hickson is the apartment owner.

It is a great story and well told. It makes you want to find shirts with separate collars.

423079,4,6302078024,"The Man Who Never Was, 1956 film

The movie starts with a body on the beach, carried in by the tide. The Allies could land at a number of places. Can they misinform the enemy so their defense of Sicily is weakened? Lt. Commander Ewan Montagu must come up with a plan to fool the enemy. ""The simpler the better."" We see life in wartime London. They meet Sir Bernard Spilsbury to talk about medical facts. Someone who died of pneumonia would have water in their lungs, like a drowned person. The body could be preserved with dry ice in a container. Operation Mincemeat is approved and critiqued. Montagu answers the questions. The Prime Minister approves the plan, cutting through red tape. They find a body that will serve their needs. The father asks that his son's body will be respected and given a Christian burial. ""Yes.""

It will be a great thing for England (but the man was a Scotsman). ""Major William Martin"" will be given papers to authenticate his identity. Pam will write a letter. [Would sea water wash out any ink?] Pam's friend Lucy uses her personal experience to compose this letter. We see the other documents used to authenticate Major Martin. [Isn't it difficult to dress a dead body?] The noise of bombs exploding adds tension to this drama. [Is that the right skin color for a dead Caucasian?] Next the ""Optical Instruments"" are delivered to a submarine. [Sailors believe a dead body brings bad luck to a ship.] Will the Major have a successful journey? [Shouldn't there have been a loss of an airplane to explain the disappearance of the Major?] The round case is delivered top side. A rubber dinghy is launched, next the Major. A short burial service is recited.

A carrier pigeon is released to carry the results. [It can't be intercepted and decoded, or traced by radio finders.] The body washes up on shore, a poor fisherman calls the authorities. A Spanish Naval Officer takes the briefcase. A man informs the British Embassy, an official asks for the briefcase. ""The Major has arrived."" The body is buried with honors, the papers are returned. Were those envelopes opened? A scientist in a lab coat tests the envelopes. ""It was opened by somebody who knows what he was doing."" But one German officer has doubts, they will send an agent to London. Mr. Riley arrives to verify Martin's past. A taxi takes him to a location. [This tells about life then, such as ""blackout curtains"".] Riley's suitcase has unusual items! Riley goes to Gieves for khaki shirts, then asks for information at the Navy Club.

This war movie that has little action, only intellectual activity. There were other deceptions, read ""The Double-Cross System"" for more details. The book ""Operation Mincemeat"" goes into more details and presents the true facts. There was an earlier example, read ""The War Magician"" about the battle El Alamein and false information taken from dead British officer.",1413244800,,3696,4.80503144654088

Per Wikipedia, it was also interesting to learn that two days after the D-Day landings, the Germans found an abandoned landing craft washed up in Normandy, containing top secret documents detailing future military targets in the region. Hitler, however, believed this was a deception similar to that depicted in this film and ignored the intelligence find. Again, during the drive into the Netherlands in Sept. 1944, complete operation details were accidently left on a glider that fell into German hands - again, this potential intelligence bonanza was ignored because of Operation Mincemeat.",1406073600,,815,5.688524590163935

Ronald Neame was truly an excellent director and his importance as a filmmaker is shamefully overlooked nowadays.  He put together a great thriller about a real WWII episode involving the British plan for the Allied forces landing in the Mediterranean in 1943. The acting is uniformily good (especially Clifton Webb, in what may be his best role from the fifties), and Gloria Grahame does wonders with a character that is just paper thin.

The films is the typical understated British War film of the postwar period, generally accurate and letting the story carry itself with little added drama.  The one departure, I believe is the subplot of the Irish pro-Nazi spy checking up on the validity of the information planted with the corpse dropped off the Spanish coast.",1393113600,2,798,4.733812949640288

423189,5,6302078024,"This particular Motion Picture shares distinction with the very ordinary and the very suspensefull. It is a story that I have viewed more than once because this time consuming effort required to produce one Major William Martin of the Royal Marines was worth watching more than once. As everybody belongs to somebody,""The Man Who Never Was"" provided such a success story that ""Operation Mincemeat"" was the code named operation with which Major William Martin of the Royal Marines helped to persuade Nazi German Officials that the documents found on Major Martins Body were to be believed. It appears as if German forces responded to this proposed threat of an invasion coming from Greece rather than Sicily thereby relocating some percentage of there forces in Italy to Greece. This had the desired affect of lowering the overall ability that could be offered by German forces when the Invasion of Sicily commenced. The film produces some tedious if a bit overstated positions as would be if we can re-locate just one battery. The tediousness of such positioning may of in fact been un-necesary as there was a loss of dramatic story telling ability as a result. Both Ewen Montagu(played by Clifton Webb) and an assistant played by Robert Fleming moved with deligence towards this films overall story. These very same offices whereby much of the intelligence discussions occurred were the very same offices that Ian Fleming was attached to. This is mentioned as both attention to detail could be overstated and otherwise as commonplace occurences. There were two women,one played Ewen Montagu's Secretary(Josephine Griffin) and the other(women) was a librarian(Gloria Grahame), the two women lived together. It can not be stated enough that these two women were instrumental in making this film work. Excellent performances as both clever and intelligent theater was very interesting to watch unfold. When these women were on their own in the presence of Nazi German Agent O'Reilly(played by Steven Boyd) there dramatic storytelling ability was pretty darn good. This film had that about it that as the film progressed it became more and more suspenseful. It seems further that the war had taken a toll which the feminine psyche had some problems with,however it was not only the feminine psyche that had a problem with the toll the war was taking. It had the desired effect of convincing an otherwise wiser man in The German Agent played by Stephan Boyd. A matter perhaps worth mentioning is that both the German Agent(played by Stephan Boyd)and the unidentified ""Man Who Never Was"" were claimed to be Scottish. A understated complaint was made to Ewen Montagu(played by Clifton Webb) by the father to this particular individual(the unidentified ""Man Who Never Was"")that they were Scottish and proud of it. Scotland was as well a Neutral Nation during World War II and should not  necessarily be considered part of the United Kingdom. Politics is here mentioned as a understated strain in Scotlands relationship with Great Britain. These moments did as it were add up,they added up to credible storytelling .I'am not so easily convinced however the scene occurring which convinced me that German Agent O'Reilly was a wiser man then we were lead to believe occurred in the officers club as he actually expressed a sincere ability that I paid attention to. I do not know if in fact German agents were so skilled but it might very well un-nerve some very resolute fellows when confronted by such sincerity. I'am reminded of a number of 00 accounts whereby Agents were to lose their lives as a result. The particular offices that were involved were in fact associated with and almost exclusively dealt with the double 00 field agent. Ewen Montagu was himself a 00 field agent with there command centralized out of office 39. This effort had people like Ian Flemming attached to its operations. This was a very real War time effort.""Operation Mincemeat""was also part of a larger operation. We do not know these things as such but perhaps it is well and good that such things are more properly handled than being the province of hucksters of a sort. This film had that degree of involvement whereby the success or failure of one particular item could doom the believability of Major William Martin of the Royal Marines. This particular mention was worth considering as there was a difference between a Motion Picture and the reality of this war time account of ""Operation Mincemeat"".This was as it were a good try. I wish to remind the reader that ""Operation Mincemeat"" was not a well made Motion Picture,it was a real time War Operations plan conducted in 1943. The very detail offerred here was not the detail that was offerred in reality. There are to be certain differences as things may actually have happened and the things that are portrayed in ""The Man Who Never Was"".There was a story told elsewhere as it involved Irwin Rommel's ""Africa Corp"".A blown up jeep with a dead soldier behind the wheel had on his person papers that showed a way around a mine field. Rommel's forces discovered the documents and a while later were found to be bogged down in quick sand like desert. There was a-lot at stake with this undertaking both as it were on film and most certainly when it counted. The Film portrays Ewen Montagu in Civilian clothes. He goes to the grave site of Major William Martin and places a Medal,a Medal that Montagu has been awarded upon a  wreath which adorns the grave of Major William Martin. It may very well be suggested that such a scene was all the more appropiate given the importance of the life of Major William Martin. ""The Man Who Never Was"" was as a result of real effort. This film was that to me both a real effort and worth as it were in mentioning the films opening narrative,""Last Night I Dreamed A Deadly Dream Beyond the Irish Sky. I saw a Dead Man win the fight and I think that Dead Man was I"".",1382227200,,5928,4.856719367588933

423192,5,6302078024,"A few years ago I read the book `Body of Lies' (which isn't very good) and it opens with the idea of planting false evidence on a dead body and leaving it for war enemies to find and I found that fascinating.  I only wished that the rest of the book was as inspired and compellingly written.

Well, `The Man Who Never Was' is compelling, from start to finish, and delivers on that very intriguing premise with marvelous results.  The film plays out almost like two films played back to back, interweaving two sets of engaging scenarios that are connected and yet feel unique and set apart on their own.  In the film's first half we have the American government planning an attack on Sicily during World War II.  In an attempt to divert attention away from their plan, they decide to plant contradictory evidence on a dead man passed off as a soldier and wash him ashore on enemy soil.  Just when it appears that the film has nowhere else to go and we're only an hour in, we get the second half, which follows an enemy spy collecting information to prove the reality of the body found.  Was this man genuine, or was it a trick?  The intensity rises in this second half as the audience is left wondering if this spy will uncover the truth.

The film is expertly written and acted by the entire cast, but it is the supporting roles that really anchor this film.  Steven Boyd (in one of his first roles) is devilishly good as the evil spy, but it is Gloria Grahame who makes the most of every moment in her supporting role as a young woman who falls in love with a doomed fighter pilot.  Her drunk scene is HOW YOU GET IT DONE, and she leaves a very lasting impression.

423320,5,6302078024,"Handsome movie, made in the 1950s, about Operation Mincemeat, the successful deception plan concocted by the British during World War II to send a corpse to the Mediterranean with false invasion plans. The Germans swallowed it whole, and left Sicilia (where the invasion finally took place) relatively unguarded.

Made by Hollywood with relatively unknown actors, this film is very entertaining, even if some of the things here turned out not to be true, though this was probably not the fault of the filmmakers. For instance, the corpse that was used in the operation belonged to a Welshman instead of a Scot (an alcoholic tramp, in actuality), and his family was not notified. And the last half hour deals with the story of an Irish spy in London working for the Germans that, while entertaining, is pure invention.

More a spy film than a war film, it can be compared, as some of the commenters have noted, to some of the best movies by Alfred Hitchcock, in the way the film builds suspense over the operation. The beautiful color photography is an enormous plus; since this was filmed just a decade after the conflict ended, this allows you to have a very good idea of what London must have looked like during the war in full colors. Some might find the patriotism in the film a bit old fashioned, but I found it refreshing in comparison with the constant cynicism and weariness of contemporary movies.",1314576000,2,1406,4.758196721311475

423393,4,6302078024,"In 1942 Allied powers greatly desired to invade Sicily--a fact of which Axis powers were well aware and against which the island was greatly fortified.  In an effort to trick the Nazi military, British intelligence agents Flight Lt. Charles Cholmondeley and Lt. Commander Ewen Montagu came up with a clever plan: a body, bearing papers indicating that the major Allied attack would come elsewhere, was floated in to Spanish waters.  Although technically neutral, Spain was sympathetic to the Nazis, and with any luck the papers would be thought genuine and reach German hands.

Although top secret even after the war, a good story is hard to keep down, and after numerous leaks Montagu himself was allowed to write an account of the deception.  Titled THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS, the book was an overnight bestseller and the 1956 film version proved very popular as well.  In retelling the story on the screen, writer Nigel Balchin took a number of liberties with the story, most particularly in the creation of ""Lucy Sherwood"" (Gloria Graham), a character who exists largely in order to provide a touch of love and pathos; even so, the film is very accurate in terms of the operation itself and how it was carried out.

Clifton Webb is perhaps best recalled for his waspish roles in such celebrated films as LAURA, but he sets aside his mannerisms for the role of Montagu and drives the action of the film in a remarkably capable manner, well supported by Robert Flemyng as assistant Lt. George Acres (based on Charles Cholmondeley) and Josephine Griffin as Pam, his secretary.  Stephen Boyd does well in the Irish-accented role of Nazi agent Patrick O'Reilly, a semi-fictional character, and Gloria Graham, always a memorable performer, scores heavily in the role of Lucy Sherwood.

he film is essentially about process--finding the right body, planting the papers, arranging for the body to be transported, and so on--and as such it moves a fast clip, with director Ronald Neame (an Oscar-winning screenwriter perhaps best now known as director of such films as I COULD GO ON SINGING, THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE, and THE POSEIDON AVENTURE) keeping everything moving at a good clip.  The DVD offers excellent picture and sound, as well as the choice between wide screen and full screen.  If you know nothing about Operation Mincemeat, you'll find it fascinating stuff--and if you do know about Operation Mincemeat you'll still find the film entertaining on its own.  Recommended.

423394,5,6302078024,"This is one of the most meticulously well told espionage stories ever!

Clifton Webb gives a stunning performance as the cold Lt. Commander Mantagu, whose mission is to create a diversion tactic to lure the Germans away from the real Italian location the British plan to invade. So he thinks of the most daring, sophisticated and simple plan of them all: to have a dead British officer carrying top secret information falling on the hands of the Germans. But the plan is not easy and every detail must be calculated with care as the Germans will know the information is too good, therefore, they will investigate the dead man's life in order to spot any fabrication.

Most of the film revolves around the making of the ""the man"" - getting the right body, producing the documents, finding him a personal life, preserving him from decomposing... and launching him from a submarine into a beach in Spain where the sharpest German operator is certain to find him.

Then it all becomes a psychological game as the British try to understand what response will come from the Germans. Did they buy it? Did they disregard him as an obvious lie? So the Germans send a top spy into Britain to investigate the life of such a valuable man - too valuable to be true.

So this is NOT a spy film like most. It has no fight or combat scenes and most of the action is pretty much like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spy-Who-Came-in-from-the-Cold/dp/B001EOQCJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</a>&nbsp;- both films even share the same cinematographer. Put on top of it all the fact that this is a British film and you'll get all the elegance, pace and charm of the best WWII films.

The DVD comes with two versions of the film (one on each side of the disc): the CinemaScope version and the unacceptable Pan&Scan version that completely destroys the CinemaScope's beautiful frame composition.

423456,4,6302078024,"""The Man Who Never Was"" is a nicely-done movie dramatization derived from the book of the same name by former British Intelligence Officer Ewan Montagu.  Montagu (played in the movie by Clifton Webb) was tasked in 1943 to divert German forces from the defense of Sicily, the next Allied objective.  Montagu and his team came up with the disturbing but unique idea of planting false papers on a dead body disguised as an Allied officer, then allowing the body to wash ashore in Fascist Spain in the hopes that the information would be passed to the Germans.

The first two thirds of the movie follows the efforts of Montagu's team to find a suitable body and prepare its legend as one Major William Martin, Royal Marines, carrying letters to high officers in the Mediterranean Theater.  Amid the disruptions of blitz-torn London, the team deals with details such as procuring a special canister in which the body can be placed, packed in dry ice, for movement by submarine to the Spanish coast. The team invents a girlfriend for the young officer; a roommate (played by Gloria Grahame) of Montagu's secretary obligingly writes the love letters that the dead Martin will carry with him.

This operation, codenamed MINCEMEAT, was a high-risk venture in that there was no assurance that the body would wash ashore, that the materials would be passed to the Germans, or that the Germans would consider the documents credible.  In the actual event, the success of the deception was not truly apparent until after the war.  The last third of the movie fills this dramatic gap by having a fictional Irishman spying for the Germans (played by Stephen Boyd) check on Martin's bonafides in London.  The team finds out about the spy late in the game and must persuade British Internal Security not to arrest him.  An emotionally-charged meeting with the roommate, grieving over the loss of her real boyfriend, turns out to be the key to the spy's mission.

This movie is highly recommended as an entertaining and dramatic tale of wartime guile and cunning, based for the most part on a real life event.",1175990400,4,2090,4.829131652661064

Clifton Webb, a rather prissy actor, makes a very good, unsuspectedly cerebral Commander Montague, but Gloria Graham as a brash American librarian is the character who sticks with you ... her contribution to the war effort is unwitting and almost as important as Major Martin's.

Besides, there's Gloria Graham doing an amazingly wonderful performance. It just amazed me how well she was in this role.

423464,5,6302078024,"The true story of the British attempt to lay some heavy disinformation on the Axis in World War II.  Clifton Webb plays Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montagu, the British naval commander who is both mastermind and chief promoter of The Plan, an elaborate concoction of forged papers, misleading faux orders, a convincing back story, and a suitable corpse meant to mislead the enemy about the Allied intentions prior to the invasion of Italy.  I don't suppose it's giving too much away to report that things more or less go as planned (although the suspicious Germans do send spy Stephen Boyd in to liven up the last third of the film.)  Even though this is indeed a war movie, bang-bang stuff, THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS practically wallows in minute details while eschewing the firefight and the foxhole.  That's not to say it doesn't have its share of situational suspense - are those depth charges going to sink the sub and scuttle the movie? - but detail is much preferred over violent action.

 Along with the likes of Monty Woolley, Webb more or less cornered the market on playing stuffy, condescending Englishmen. Here Webb's strength, a stiff and rather formal persona who needs a baby-sat seven-year-old to evoke his humanity, is put to good use.  There are no kids around and Webb doesn't unbend, but this movie doesn't care that much about the personal life of its characters, anyway, save for poor Gloria Grahame, who's given the rather thankless task of shedding some plot-directed tears and seems rather out of place for her troubles.

 Even though it's clinical and relatively bloodless - in every sense of the word - THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS is a great deal of fun.  Director Ronald Neame lovingly dwells on every step of the preparation, through to the execution of the caper, and has us deeply involved when the whole thing is threatened with the appearance of the Boyd character.  THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS is a fine, thoughtful film that should appeal to those who aren't necessarily great fans of action war movies.",1131148800,7,2010,4.747126436781609
423465,5,6302078024,"Britain has traditionally been a naval power but never

had a large standing army.  This has prodded its military

planners to think in unconventional terms in striking

at its enemies.  This means using its naval forces to

move stealthily around its continental enemies

using naval forces  and to try to use deception

to get the enemy off guard, rather than confronting

them head on.  The failed First World War operation at Gallipoli was

a good example of this, trying to strike at Germany

""through the back door"", rather than just head on

in the blood-soaked trenches of Flanders on the

Western Front.

In the Second World War, all the British leaders  and

senior officers

had been traumatized by the slaughter of the

First World War and were desperate to come up with

ways of avoiding a replay.  Thus, in 1943, after North

Africa had been cleared of Axis forces, the British

military leaders sought a way to distract the Germans

from the obvious next target, which was Sicily.

The result was deception of ""Operation Mincemeat"" which is portrayed

in this excellent film. The film is based on Ewen

Montagu's book ""The Man Who Never Was"".  This film

is of a long-lost genre of films which are riveting

in spite of the fact that they don't have any ""action"",

(i.e. shoot-outs, fist fights, car chases, etc), like another of my favorites ""Twelve Angry Men"".

A close observation of the film shows, beside the main

story, a lot of other information showing what wartime

Britain was like, such as how London became run-down

and grimy during the long years of bombing and austerity,

how the British learned to take the air raids in stride,

the resignation to the on-going deaths of relatives and

friends

and the shortages of quality consumer goods. In addition,

we see the manifestations of the traditionally tense relationship between

Britain and Ireland as well as Scotland. For military

buffs, there is a brief look at the legendary Mosquito

fighter/bomber and the unsung British submarine force (as

compared to those of the United States and the German

U-Boat force).

One thing to keep in mind is that while Montagu makes

no mention of German efforts to authenticate the existence

of ""Major Martin"", the film devotes a considerable part

of its plot to that, which I assume is ""overdramatized""

to keep the interest of the audience.  The film claims

that the German (actually Irish) agent actually gets in

contact with someone who had a part in the whole operation,

and I doubt whether this is factual.  However,

this is a minor point and does not detract from the excellence of the film.",1129939200,7,2629,4.821266968325792

423500,4,6302078024,"This is a fine movie of wartime espionage, disinformation and deception. Based on the book by Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montagu, it tells of British Naval Intelligence's attempt to deceive the Germans about the planned 1943 invasion of Sicily. Trying to draw as many German troops away from Sicily as possible, they concocted a plan to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain, with papers purportedly from Allied High Command indicating that the invasion would go by way of Greece or Sardinia instead of Sicily. The subterfuge succeeded. The Germans embarked on a massive build up of defences around Sardinia and the Greek Peloponnesus, thinning out their defences on Sicily. The hoax affected not only the Sicilian offensive but had effects across the entire European theater. Hitler swallowed it whole. Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was sent to personally supervise the defence of Greece. The 1st Panzer Division was withdrawn from France. Two other Panzer divisions were withdrawn from the Russian front just when they were needed at the crucial Battle of Kursk. Operation Mincemeat, as it was called, was one of the most ingenious and successful hoaxes perpertrated by the Allies during the Second World War.

This is a war movie with little battlefront action. It concentrates on the quiet background work of the Intelligence Service. The first half of the movie deals with the hatching of the plan, the procurement of the dead body, the faking of the dead man's history and the drawing up of his elaborate cover story. The fictional officer is christened ""Major William Martin"" of The Royal Marines. The second half starts when the Germans fall for the ruse and send a spy over to England to check out its veracity. There follows a cat and mouse game as the British try to tie up loose ends and fill in the fake history they have put together for the dead man, including his purported girlfriend. The movie is always absorbing, often rivetingly so. It is one of the few WW2 espionage films that have stood the test of time. The fact that it was a true story makes it doubly interesting.

Fox have released a barebones edition of the film on DVD. It contains both the widescreen version in its original 2.55:1 Cinemascope (enhanced for widescreen TV) and a fullscreen pan-&-scan version. The widescreen version strangely is placed on the unmarked flipside of the double-sided DVD. Picture quality is fine, very good in fact if you consider this film dates from 1955. There is very little dirt, speckling or any print damage. Colors are strong and bright. Skintones look natural. Black levels are well rendered. The pan-&-scan version version looks terrible in comparison, with a claustrophobic, darker image, heavier grain and a softer picture overall. Sound is available in the original English 2.0 mono, a 4.0 Surround remix as well as alternate Spanish and French 2.0 mono tracks. A single theatrical trailer is all that's included. A fine memento of wartime subterfuge and deception with solid acting and direction from a time when there was still a viable British Film Industry.

Note: The grave at Huelva, on the southern coast of Spain still bears the name ""Major William Martin"". The real identity of the dead man was kept secret for over 50 years. It was only in 1996 that he was finally identified as a homeless alcoholic Welshman. Today, across the bottom of the white marble tombstone is an added epitaph, finally revealing his identity, ""Glyndwr Michael served as Major William Martin"".",1121731200,82,3489,4.940374787052811
423501,3,6302078024,"The body of a dead British officer washes ashore on a Spanish beach; he has on him documents alluding to British forces landing in Greece. Before the Nazis rush from Sicily (where the Brits actually will land) to Greece, they send an agent to London to determine if the intelligence is genuine. That's the intrigue in this intriguing docudrama financed by Hollywood (thus the miscasting of Clifton Webb and Gloria Grahame) but made by English director Ronald Neame on real locations using English actors.

Cast against type, Webb is suitably correct. Grahame, an Oscar winner for ""The Bad and the Beautiful,"" however, is embarrassing in a key but contrived role as a librarian whose flyer lover is killed. As the Nazi agent snooping around London, the handsome Stephen Boyd dominates the last quarter of the film with steely charm, reminding us again what a loss his early death was to films in the 1950s. And it's nice to see Sir Cyrl Cusack and Joan Hickson (later Miss Marple on television) in bit parts.

What's not so nice (in the version I saw) is the shameful DVD transfer, which begins and ends in the original Cinemascope but throughout reformats to full screen, diminishing the reach of the actual locations and the re-creation of wartime London. This true story, especially the invention of a non-person's whole life, ranks with John LeCarre's tales and ""Five Fingers"" (still unreleased on DVD) as one of Hollywood's better espionage films. ""The Man Who Never Was,"" considering what he achieved, deserved more respect.",1118793600,18,1529,4.96875
423502,5,6302078024,"I first saw this movie as a  kid when it came out.  The opening is magisterial: a body washed up on a lonely Cinemascope beach at dawn, and a mature male, Scottish accented voice-over reciting the doom-laden lines:

""Last Night I dreamed a deadly dream,

That beyond the Isle of Skye,

I saw a dead man win the fight

And I think that man was I.""

The scene and the words stayed with me through the years to this day.  I have just watched the DVD.  The movie remains taut, swift, detailed, unfussy, truly a remarkable yarn very well told and acted.  No gore, no chases, no explosions, the tech is low, the methods rigorously parsed and distilled, but at the core remaining improvisatory, as one reads they were during the war.  This film sees itself as having no need to impress in any  way other than by having believable, life-sized characters, develop the tale efficiently and well. So refreshing, these days.

The movie hasn't aged.  Seeing it as a kid led me to read the book.  I don't think I will re-read it, but I can certainly envision playing the DVD again and sharing it with friends. Clifton Webb is superb in a role which illustrates what a multifaceted, wonderful actor he was.  He has a way of showing brains and wisdom without calling attention to himself. The sort of behaviour one would expect from a consummate intelligence operative.  Good script and top-notch acting.

Notwithstanding Cinemascope and the war-pic trappings, this is an economical, concise film which tells a gripping tale and goes by fast.  But that poem and that body on the lonely beach linger in the imagination.",1118534400,5,1602,4.6571428571428575
423503,5,6302078024,"As the North African campaign of WWII drew to a close it became obvious that the Allies next move would be to invade Sicily. A deception was therefore needed to try to lure away some of the German defences. Inter-services ""XX Committee"" (XX for double-cross) members Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu, and Squadron Leader Sir Archibald Cholmondley hatched the then unheard of plan of planting a body in the sea off Spain where prevailing currents would surely carry it inshore to the Huelva region, known to be the territory of one of the Nazis' best Spanish agents. The body, dressed as a major in the Royal Marines and apparently killed in a plane crash at sea, would be carrying supposedly top secret documents aimed at convincing any reader that the invasion target was not Sicily at all, but Greece. Montagu himself plays a cameo role in the film as an Air Marshall.

The film takes us through the planning and execution of what its creators hoped would become one of the most successful and unusual deceptions in the history of warfare. The leading role of Montagu is played by Clifton Webb, utterly credible as a British naval officer, while Robert Flemyng, who had himself served conspicuously in WWII and who was awarded the Military Cross and Order of The British Empire, takes on the role of Montagu's junior assistant, a composite role based partly on Cholmondley's real-life character. Together they must procure a body that will pass a medical examination to determine the cause of death and they must also create a personality and a past life and history for this man.

This is a true-story that avoids battle scenes and big bangs. There are no special effects. It describes a war of stealth and cunning and the cat and mouse game of espionage. It is an atmospheric suspense thriller with Stephen Boyd effective as the determined Axis agent, Patrick O'Reilly, sent in from Ireland to verify the existence and past life of this man who never was. While the soundtrack is one of Alan Rawsthorne's (The Cruel Sea) better scores, it is nevertheless immediately recognizable as one of his compositions, unfortunately sounding so much like all his others. It is ably directed by the great and sometimes under-rated Ronald Neame. It is beautifully filmed, as are all of former-cameraman Neame's pictures. The voice of Churchill is provided by the young Peter Sellers who, at that time in 1956, was establishing his versatility and making a name for himself in the BBC radio comedy, ""The Goon Show"".

20th Century Fox's DVD video and sound quality are excellent, as would be expected in the studio release of one of their own productions. A worthy and entertaining addition to any WWII film collection and if it gives you an appetite for a more in-depth recounting of the true story, Ewen Montagu's 1953 book is still available in both the hardback and paperback editions.",1118188800,4,2879,4.871428571428571

""Last Night I dreamed a deadly dream

Beyond the Isle of Skye.

I saw a dead man win the fight

And I think that man was I.""

So begins a classic World War II espionage thriller that tells the audacious but true story of ""Major William Martin."" The name's made up, his true identity a secret, but even in death ""Major Martin"" pulled off a daring deception that misled the Nazi's into diverting their defenses, convinced the Allies would invade Greece or perhaps Sardinia instead of Sicily.

Clifton Webb stars as Lt. Commander Montagu, creator of the plan to send a carefully picked dead body, tricked out as a drowned English officer complete with personal artifacts and actual but untrue letters from and to top military leaders, to wash up on a specific Spanish coast where it was likely to fall into german hands.

But when the Germans do get hold of the body, everything about it seems too good to be true and they send an Irish agent, a young and menacing Stephen Boyd, to England to authenticate the identity of ""William Martin.""

The race is on with British intelligence scrambling to stay ahead of the game with the Nazi agent who has targeted the ""fiance"" of ""Martin.""

423536,4,6302078024,"In what was one of the most successful and infamous deceptions of World War II British intelligence fooled the entire Nazi war machine - and all with the help of a man who never existed.

The deceptions that British intelligence pulled off prior to the D-Day landings are now well-known and well documented - from Gen. Patton being in charge of a fake army to the use of double agents. The allies were able to keep vital German panzer tanks and troops away from the Normandy beaches as Hitler kept his attention on the Calais region.

Yet even before this British intelligence scored another coup by diverting German attention away from the imminent invasion of Sicily by making the Germans believe that Greece and perhaps Sardinia were the actual targets.

They did this by creating the man who never was. Taking the body of a man whose condition could be interpreted as having died from drowning, dressing him in clothes with accompanying documentation and casting him off from a submarine just off the coast of Spain. All with the goal that the body and the vital top secrets it carried being intercepted by the Nazi's.

It was an inspired scheme and this movie, in much the same vein as the similar true-life deception movie I WAS MONTY'S DOUBLE really shines. It's thoroughly entertaining and well acted throughout.

The detail the British went through to confuse the Germans was phenominal and was very adequately portrayed in the movie.  David Niven playing the lead did a good job of portraying the methodical British Naval officer in charge of the detail.  Another great British Naval movie had two names.  The first one was ""The Persuit Of The Graf Spee"" and then released as ""The Battle Of The River Plate"".  It was filmed in great color and was about the battle off South America between the German pocket battleship Graf Spee and 3 cruisers, two British and one New Zealand: The Ajax, Exeter and Achilles.  The Graf Spee was portrayd by the US Navy's heavy cruiser USS Salem and because of the difference in US and British ship construction the look of the Graf Spee was very different from the British ships and therefore much more believable.

423539,5,6302078024,"Although the film was a ostensibly a 20th Century Fox production, THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS was filmed in England using primarily English crew and cast (though American leads).  It belongs to a tradition of English war films in which aspects of the war are treated slowly, deliberately, and with great precision.  While in the US war films tended to feature John Wayne leading Marines into combat, the British tended to focus much more on the preparation and plans of operations.  For instance, the very fine film THE DAM BUSTERS features very little in the way of actual combat.  And THE MAN WHO NEVER WAY has no combat whatsoever.
The movie is based on a book by the same name about Operation Mincemeat, in which the British attempted to mislead the Germans about the intended invasion spot for D-Day by planting a corpse with fake papers on a beach in Spain, knowing that the Spanish would pass the papers onto the Germans.  The entire movie is involved with the formation of the plan, and then creating the man who never was, creating his papers and personal effects.  On one level, not much happens in the film, but on another it is one of the most fascinating films ever made about the war, because of the practical problems they deal with in the executing of the operation.  Knowing that it was all based upon real events greatly adds to the appeal of the film.
Clifton Webb, who was in fact far too old for the part, turns in a convincing performance as Lieutenant Commander Montagu.  In most of his films he comes across as arrogant, but in this one he instead communicates competence and intelligence.  Gloria Grahame is excellent as the primary female presence in the film.  If you look carefully, you can spot Stephen Boyd in a small role, a few years before he would portray Messala in BEH-HUR.",1040947200,180,1803,4.623824451410658

Anyhow, ""The Man Who Never Was"" describes the true events of the British trying to confuse the Germans as to where the Allies will invade - Sicily or Greece.  By arranging to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain with top-secret documents, the British cause the Germans to alter their defenses, thus saving the Allies from suffering even more casualties.  How the British found a body, the details that they had to come up with to make the Germans believe the body was for real, and the subsequent German effort to determine whether or not the information found on the body was accurate, all make for an exciting story which moves at a swift pace.  This is really a great World War II movie.",1017446400,88,979,4.435754189944134

423542,3,6302078024,"This is the story of a British plot to trick the Germans during WWII into believing that, despite all appearances and obvious logic, they were going to invade Greece rather than Sicily.  Clifton Webb stars as the officer that cooks up the plan, which essentially involves having a body wash up on shore in Spain with planted information that will do the misleading.  A shiny Gloria Grahame co-stars as the woman who seems to be engaged to the man who never was, since they must create an identity for him.  Sound confusing?  It's not really as it unfolds in the film.  The plot is quite interesting, especially given the fact that we know it's mostly true, although things happen quite quickly and it seems that this operation was much easier than I suspect it was.  It's certainly not the greatest war/spy film ever made, but it is fun to watch the plot unfold and come together.  It was definitely a brilliant, risky plan.",993945600,7,924,4.631901840490798
423543,5,6302078024,"Clifton Webb & Gloria Grahame shine in this mostly true story about a plan to deceive the Germans about Allied plans to invade Sicily in WWII.  The Stephen Boyd character as a German spy sent to England is a fabrication  & within the past couple of years the identity of the title character  has been revealed, I believe.
Highly recommended.",966384000,6,341,4.65
423544,3,6302078024,"The Man Who Never Was creates a solid war movie that is better known for the plot, but not for the suspense. The plot is billiant...plant fake invasion plans on corpse, and hope the Germans fall for the  bait.
Unfortunately, good plot movies end up ""connect the dot""  themes unless there is real suspense. Everthing goes pretty much according  to plan and we don't have the ""Dial M For Murder"" or the ""39  Steps"" type of intrigue. For example, the British pretty much rubber  stamp this project, despite the severity of the plan. Yes, there is  discussion of the plan, but one could be arguing for more orders of  ballpoint pens versus inkwell pens. Then, the villain, the one who is  supposed to check out the story, pretty much covers a routine checklist  that any failed detective would follow. It is not clear why he would go to  extremes of sacrificing his life to determine the validity of the plot.  There is little character development. Surely, there would have been better  ways to obtain the truth, especially once he gets most of the clues. For  example, the non-membership of the deceased at the club...following Lucy to  see if she goes to any memorial services, etc. The villain would thus be  hidden and not expose his identity.
Still, one should not be too harsh.  The plot is based on a true story and this itself gives admiration to the  wartime effort of the British to beat the Germans. One can only imagine the  courage of the Bristish soldier( played by Clifton Webb) in a formalized  structure of the British hierarchy to not only propose this plot but to  execute it. But that is why we are really ready to dodge some bullets and  swing at the curve balls. I think then we would have gotten a better flavor  of the team work needed to make this plot work. Then this would have been a  great movie rather just a good one.",957657600,8,1845,4.524242424242424
423545,5,6302078024,"Clifton Webb is perfectly cast as the British Naval Officer who devises the plan to decieve German Intelligence, as to the whereabouts of the Allied landings in Sicily during World War 2. As with most British films of  its kind, ""The Man Who Never Was"" relies upon the facts to  maintain interest throughout,tampering with history just enough to provide  tension and drama where it is needed. Webb's performance is both  intelligent and touching, while Stephen Boyd as the German agent sent to  investigate the situation,exudes just the right amount of charm and  malevolence. Gloria Graham is probably the only downside to this highly  effective film,but the others well and truly make up for her somewhat  overcooked effort. Made in 1956, in colour, ""The Man Who Never  Was"" has not ""dated"" at all and stands as a fine example of  the British cinema's ability to tell a good story well.",938131200,27,888,4.899328859060403

Dont remember where I first saw it, but DO remember that I really loved this movie.  Amazon is really terrific in that you can buy almost anything.  Decided to add to my DVD collection.
A little slow moving, but it is based on a true story.  Loved Christopher Webb and he nailed the part of the planner of this extreme ruse to fool the Naxis.  Wont go into the story or plot.  That can be read in the movies description.  My one personal dislike was the acting of Gloria Graham.  Way too overdone, but that is a minor flaw.",1521504000,,622,4.301724137931035

7821031,5,6302078024,"I can't convey in a short review how much I love this movie! It's one of my all time favorite WWII films, along with No Man is an Island and Heaven Knows Mr. Allison. This movie, based on the true story of British Operation Mincemeat, hooks you right from the beginning. It has it all--a great story, suspense, a great script, great direction, likable characters, everything. One of my favorite scenes is where they are dressing the body getting ready to put it into the shipping canister and bombs are falling onto the streets above them and they just keep right on working in silence as if everything is normal. The whole angle with the Nazi spy in London, hunting down info on Major Martin is suspenseful and makes this film into a genuine spy thriller as well. The ending where the spy confronts Pam and Lucy is incredible. Josephine Griffin is wonderful as Webb's steadfast assistant, Pam and so is Gloria Grahame as the lovelorn Lucy. The film, having been made in the 1950's, still has that 1940's look to it and as such, it transports you to wartime London. Nothing inappropriate, just good clean, suspenseful entertainment. For the price, this film is a must own. If only they made more like this one. Martin genuine, indeed!",1513987200,2,1234,4.665137614678899
