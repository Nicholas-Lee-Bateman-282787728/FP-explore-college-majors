700541,5,630366833X,This DVD is smashing.  So creative and reflective of how seriously Gloria takes her work. Anything she is ever connected with is always quality. She outshines any of the current Divas who sell more records with their power  arias but can't hold a candle to her knowledge of every aspect of the  music business. This one belongs in every music library and my god is it  visually stunning as well.,929664000,11,395,4.6

7852632,5,630366833X,"Some people have talent, some have heart and some have class. Gloria has it ALL! And yet she remains humble and never takes her gifts for granted. Always willing to remember and do for others. Loves and respects herself and her family.  Her music thrills me. The only thing better would be to meet her in person.  Carry on, lovely lady!",1405728000,2,336,4.491803278688525

7852635,5,630366833X,"Great Gloria Estefan CD!  I'm a big fan of Gloria's so I truely enjoyed every bit of this DVD, recommend!",1363824000,2,105,4.25
7852636,5,630366833X,"This music video collection contains 17 of Gloria's Best Music Videos. If you like Gloria, you'll definitely enjoy all of these fantastic videos. What makes this different from other artist's video collections, is that Gloria ""narrates"" &/or explains the videos, before it is shown, thus giving the viewer, all the details, and etc. that were involved in the making of the video.

Since the Amazon Product Description does not give a list of the 17 Music Videos in this DVD, then I will, and hopefully this will be helpful for potential buyers.
The Music Videos are as follows:

1. Program Start - Gloria gives an introduction to this video collection.
2. Live For Loving You
3. Always Tomorrow - inspired after a Hurricane destroyed homes in Miami.
4. Go Away
5. I See Your Smile
6. Mi Tierra
7. Con Los Anos Que Me Quedan
8. Mi Buen Amor
9. TURN THE BEAT AROUND!!! TOTALLY AWESOME!!! THIS WAS FILMED ON TOP OF ONE OF THE TALLEST BUILDINGS IN MIAMI. Also, the song was featured in the movie ""The Specialist"", starting Sylvester Stallon (a.k.a. Rocky Balboa). Also the video incorporates some of the scenes from that movie.
10. It's Too Late - This is the Carol King Classic performed ""Gloria Style"".
11. EVERLASTING LOVE - filmed when Gloria was 9 months pregnant, so she had Gloria impersonaters (including men) to fill in for her. And some of them do look a lot like Gloria.
12. Hold Me, Trill Me, Kiss Me
13. This Christmas
14. Silent Night
15. Abriendo Puertas
16. MEGAMIX - INCLUDES PARTS OF ""1 - 2 - 3"", ""THE RHYTHM IS GONNA GET YA"", ""THE CONGA"", & ""GET ON YOUR FEET"". THIS IS TOTALLY ""AWESOME""!!!
17. Turn the Beat Around  (12"" Mix)
18. Everlasting Love (12"" Mix)
19. End Credits.

This is one ""awesome"" music video collection, and I highly recommed it. Thanks!!!!",1339286400,9,1772,4.6158730158730155
7852637,5,630366833X,"This is a great DVD for fans of all ages to buy,this has 17 of her best music videos past and present and also interwiews with Gloria Estefan,special features and much more also.",1254614400,2,178,4.424242424242424
7852638,5,630366833X,"I've owned this dvd for a long time and it's really worth the purchase. You get 17 great music videos that are all very well produced and enjoyable to watch. One of the songs included is the haunting ""I See Your Smile."" This one has a vintage 55 corvette and an obviously off the cuff exchange between Gloria and Andy Garcia at the end that is a lot of fun.

Another highlight is the music video for Gloria's excellent cover of Carole King's, ""It's Too Late.""  Gloria is trapped in a room where it is raining and lamenting the end of a relationship too broken to be repaired. It is very sensual and Gloria's feminine appeal is very evident on this one. The beautiful and joyous ""This Christmas"" video with it's lush and colorful look is here also.

All her exciting and catchy radio hits are included and every video had some thought put into it. You can feel the Miami nightlife on some of these videos and white sun drenched beaches on others. There is more to Gloria than her pop songs and she has not given her Cuban roots short thrift here.

Spanish selections such as ""Con Los Anos Que Me Quedan,"" ""Mi Tierra,""  ""Abriendo Puertas,"" and ""Mi Buen Amor"" add a dash of spice to the mix. As an added bonus feature, Gloria talks about all the songs and her music in general. These conversations have an intimate feel and are interspersed between each video. Gloria has always loved and appreciated her fans and this comes across in those conversations. You can play it straight through and catch all the music, plus Gloria's comments, or simply click from song to song to only view the music.

Directed by Ken Schreiber and produced by Daniel Kushnick, this will bring back memories for a lot of us who grew up listening to Gloria on the radio and have come to appreciate the more artistic elements as we've gotten older. This is warm, friendly and sexy, just like Gloria. Don't miss this one!",1128211200,7,1893,4.504373177842566
