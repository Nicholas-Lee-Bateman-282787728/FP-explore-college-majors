8524897,5,B0083Y8GRY,"I learned a lot watching this video.  From how to find the iron ore, smelting it in a home-grown furnace, removing carbon and restoring carbon... then finally, in becoming an axe.  Scotty/Sioux City.",1507852800,,199,5.0
8524898,5,B0083Y8GRY,Very detailed,1464566400,,13,6.0
8524899,5,B0083Y8GRY,Absolutely wonderful!  Great video with wonderful explanation.  Just wish I could apprentice with them.,1409097600,,103,6.285714285714286
8524900,5,B0083Y8GRY,There are few things out there that provide this type of information. It's a very good movie that was well made.,1403481600,,112,4.380952380952381
8524901,5,B0083Y8GRY,"I enjoyed watching this film. As other reviewers have noted, it captures some really amazing moments in the process. The production value feels really high for the handful of smiths that appeared in the credits. Well done.
It is short in comparison to a movie, but sweet. I will try to support more creative efforts like this in the future.",1393459200,,340,4.683333333333334
8524902,5,B0083Y8GRY,"A great flick.  Everything you'd ever want to see or know about iron working; literally from the ground up!  The photography was professional.  The audio was just as it should be; clear and concise.  The progression from start to finish was logical, orderly, organized and to the point.  I used to be a professional film-maker for a large insurance company.... (don't ask...)... and I know of what I speak.

This is NOT a scientific, chemical laced, up-tight lecture on metallurgy!!  It is rather a fun, informal, easy-going video using basic iron ore and making an ax.  This was a most educational and enjoyable video.  I'd buy it again....even at the terrible price listed..........!.",1372723200,2,686,5.0
8524903,4,B0083Y8GRY,The video shows exactly what the title says.  From ore gathered in the woods to an axe cutting a tree down.  I only wish it was longer.  The video is a little pricey but if you want to see what backyard smelting looks like this is it.  I found myself thinking about where I could come by some iron ore...,1360627200,2,304,4.016666666666667
8524904,5,B0083Y8GRY,I was trying to figure out why the properties are so different. I know what the different compounds are  but did not understand in any detail as to why. This is the perfect add on for any blacksmith trying to do true reproductions of the past. Really the only resources needed to understand it for the hands on types (like me) out there.,1356566400,,337,4.349206349206349
8524905,5,B0083Y8GRY,"Enough info in this DVD to show anyone how to make their own iron. Not an easy process, but doable. Should be of interest to blacksmiths and historians.",1351900800,,152,4.464285714285714
