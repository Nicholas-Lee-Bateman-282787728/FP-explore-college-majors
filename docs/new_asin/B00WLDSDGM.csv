8713739,5,B00WLDSDGM,"When Rinaldo made its debut in 1711, the idea was to ""give Two Senses equal Pleasure.""  The production featured live sparrows flying on stage, lightening and thunder and dragons belching fire.  I would love to see somebody try a human acted production with modern technology.  However this puppet version seems close to the intent of Handel and his collaborators.  It has gaudy paper sets and makes a good attempt at crusades era costumes.  The singers stand in the wings or in the orchestra and the camera often cuts to them.  Wolfgang Katschner leads a zippy original instrument performance with superb vocalists.

A few of caveats which were minor for me.  The musical performance, as judged by the accompanying CDs is about 130 minutes while the Hogwood CD set lasts about 43 minutes longer.  I haven't done my homework to find out if the cuts were just not doing the repeated section of da capos or something more serious.  There were too many closeups of the puppets' faces and strings, destroying the little illusion you get when you watch in a theater.  Also, while the beginning, end and extras of the video were in 16:9 aspect ratio, there were black bars at the top and bottom of the screen during the opera itself.",1455580800,4,1226,4.735849056603773
