She is very detail oriented and points out all the pertinent details to remember.  This is classic textbook Pilates.  Joe would be proud.",1490659200,,244,5.54054054054054

8428894,5,B004GNEE22,"As a Pilates beginner, I found the DVD to be exactly what I needed.  I especially like the fact that Darien shows basic, beginner, intermediate and advanced versions of each exercise.  That way, though I'm humbled by how much I still need to do to get in shape, there is a trajectory I can follow to get to that point.  The stretches that went along  with the First Seven program were very helpful!",1443571200,,398,4.410958904109589
