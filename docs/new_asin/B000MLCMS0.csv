Like 4 minutes of 4 shows
It's a preview type of deal narrated by Ren & Stimpy",1429660800,,134,4.1923076923076925
8169700,5,B000MLCMS0,"Hey, it's definitely a cool vignette of how it was to actually see nickelodeon on TV in the 90s.
It was a very humble release that featured some pretty cool animation variety and humor.
I picked it up recently for a few cents, luckily. But it's very fun and if you ever do come across it, it just may be worth the play. Made me laugh pretty well and it has a cute song sang by Billy West as the credits roll.",1429488000,,408,3.9878048780487805
8169701,3,B000MLCMS0,"I love classic Nickelodeon and have been collecting VHS cassettes and nostalgic DVD compilations for years.
This being said, I was very excited to see this variety pack at a reasonable price, used from a seller. Once I received the video I was slightly disappointed because each segment is compacted into 3-5 minutes. Not even a full episode to showcase the wonderful programs on it! Sad really. If you're looking for a great VHS collection, try the SNICK volumes 1 & 2 or find these shows separately on DVD.",1382054400,,508,4.719101123595506
8169702,5,B000MLCMS0,"I love this VHS! It has all of the shows that I use to watch on Nickelodeon as a child in the 90's. Like, Clarissa explains it all, Rocko's modern life, Doug, The Rugrats,Ren and Stimpy ect...It's a great buy! Although I do wish that they would put all of these great shows as a compiliation on DVD.",1239321600,3,299,4.172413793103448
