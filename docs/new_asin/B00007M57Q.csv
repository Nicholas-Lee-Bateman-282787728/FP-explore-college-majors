1821930,4,B00007M57Q,"Wow! ""Bloody Murder 2,"" the sequel to a horror movie with no plot, no gore, no sex, and no fun. What was I thinking when I rented this? It was a lucky thing that the cover persuaded me to give it a try. This movie is about another gorup of teens closing camp placid pines up for the winter five years after the original murders. With only a few days left until they go home, the counselors begin to disappear, one by one...
 ""Bloody Murder 2"" is a huge improvement over the original. The gore is great and the death scenes are pretty original and well done. The story is a little better, with a nice plot twist at the very end. The real strength here is in the sexual content. This movie doesn't skimp on sex or nudity. There is a shower scene where sex is almost present along with alot of nudity and there is another scene where two counselore screw up against a tree and on the ground with a ton of nudity. The acting is also above par for a slasher movie. This movies is definetly worth a rental.

1821931,4,B00007M57Q,"I gotta say this one was an improvement. The first one was the slasher movie without the slashing. I mean, oddly, no gore, very little profanity, and no nudity, all of this overshadowed by a VERY Scooby Dooish plotline. But, it did involve a hockey mask, a summer camp, and some girls, so I liked it okay. In this movie, however, we see a return to time-honored traditions, and I found them encouraging. Essential elements are thrown into the mix.
The Plus Column:
a. You get to see the camp bullies (two sissies that looked like rejects from the bad karate kids in Karate Kid) turned into spare parts. Always cool. Subsection #1: Most of the people you dislike the most get bumped off at a reasonably fast rate, with only a couple of exceptions.
b. They actually explain the whole ambiguous Trever Moorehouse thing, which they skipped in the first one, although, unfortunately, the origin isn't very original.
c. Many of the murders happened at night, under the proper atmosphere, unlike the first one where almost everyone got semi-slashed in broad daylight.
d. Chicks, baby, chicks! Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about. The first one had some pretty girls, but these chicks are much hotter. As a matter of fact, the whole thing centers around a nymphish blonde, honey-skinned and long-legged, ooh yeah, very distracting, which is cool because she takes your mind off of the lower points of the film.
The Con Column:
a. The killer had no theme at all. He wore overalls over a hooded sweatshirt, and a mask like the Tooth Fairy in Darkness Falls. No trademark weapons. I mean, I know in the first one they ripped both the Main Man Jason Vorhees and Leatherface with the hockey mask and chainsaw, but it was still better than what you have this time around. Vorhees wouldn't even spit in this guy's direction. Madman Marz, I hate to say, looked cooler.
b. The same Scooby Doo storyline. When the killer is revealed at the end, I know he was chomping his teeth to say, ""Those meddling kids."" But the good thing is, instead of Fred, Daphne, Velma, Scooby and Shaggy, you just kinda have a blonde Daphne.
c. The head camp guy, owner, whatever he was. Uuggh. He made Patrick from the first movie look like Bruce Willis from Last Man Standing. I can't see how ANY parent would send their kid to this guy for the summer.
All and all, I'd say this movie is worth the effort, especially if you saw the first one. I didn't rent it, I bought it, and it was pretty well worth the money.",1048204800,5,2478,4.558295964125561
1821932,4,B00007M57Q,I give this independent slasher film four stars for the plain reason of surpassing the original... it was gorier... scarier... more mysterious... better acting... longer... and hotter cast members! Rent it at your local video store today!,1045785600,,238,5.45945945945946
1821933,5,B00007M57Q,"You can barely create a new concept in movies today that make people take notice. Horror movies always borrow an idea from a classic film like Friday the 13th or Halloween and try to make it in there own way. Think of it as a tribute to films they love. It barely works without fans getting there opinions in about how the movie was a bad rip off and no one should watch these films. Granted for every one straight to dvd horror film ive seen, ive seen about twenty that suck. Also, the cast of teens always seems to be the same stale characters you've seen in every other horror film. I remember seeing Bloody Murder and thinking it was a complete rip off of Friday the 13th, but I enjoyed the film and seperated the two. I knew of this sequel but never watched it until recently. Before the movie starts you get a pretty cool montage of what happens in the film and the extras had the Nightmare on Elm Street like opition of Jump to a death scene. The movie is pretty good. I heard a reviewer complain because the death scenes have all been done before. Well what you expect? Mostly every death sceniro has been done before. I couldn't tell who the killer was and that was refreshing. All in all, get this film if you appericate horror films. Dont think of it as a rip off but a tribute.",1214611200,,1289,4.2439024390243905
1821934,4,B00007M57Q,"Bloody Murder 2 is so much better than the first it's hard to believe it's written by the same person.

Where the first movie lacked gore, nudity, pace, night scenes or real actors, this time around they leave NONE of them out.

Of course it's not exactly original, but what is, people saying that the killer has the same number of sillables as Jason have probably never heard of Freddy Krueger or Michael Myers! Sad!

If you're looking to return to real old school slasher movies then Bloody Murder 2 is for you (though you still might want to give the first movie a miss.

1821935,3,B00007M57Q,"I give this movie a strong 3 1/2 stars. I own and enjoyed Bloody Murder Part 1 but I find this one was better than the first. The legend of Trever Moorhouse returns! The plot is similar to a Friday The 13th movie with teens staying at a cabin in the woods as camp counselors. After the teens sit around a campfire and play a game of Bloody Murder... the murders begin. Trevor Moorhouse is back and badder than ever. There were great killing scenes in this movie and great gore effects. ""Trevor"" uses everything from a chainsaw to a shredder to hacking up people. For gore fans, the guy crawling on the ground while being hacked up is a great scene! At first, the kids keep saying that Trevor Moorhouse is only a fiction tale but when they start getting murdered one by one, the realize that maybe the story isn't a story after all. There is a surprise ending but it's hard to tell if there is a part 3 in the works. For true slasher movie fans, I recommend renting or even buying this movie. Not all horror movies set in the woods turn out to be good horror movies but this one does. And for fans of the slashers wearing masks movies, this one is for you. Cool mask ""Trevor"".",1140652800,,1175,4.25
1821936,2,B00007M57Q,"I cannot believe how crappy this low budget horror film is! This movie also is such a SUPER rip off of Friday the 13th, I think they should sue! I mean come on! ""Jason Voorhees""! ""Trevor Moorehouse""! The people who thought this one up were totally retarded! DER!!! The film was only about 23% enjoyable, and the gore was not that scary. The ending did not make sense and the there was a huge plot hole! I mean...what? This movie is not even a good rental. If you just want to see every horror movie that comes out might as well rent this and see how dumb it is.",1137628800,,561,4.155963302752293
1821937,1,B00007M57Q,bloody murder 2 was a ok movie i give it a d+ cause the killer had a kool looking mask the chainsaw kills were great and the boob shots were awsome but it lacked a good plot cause there was people just getting killed and the ending was boreing it just ended with out any good mystery or anything it was just trevor kill his father and walks off and the remaining living people just simply walk away its really a waste of money just watch it if it was for free or if someone else is watching it,1127952000,,493,3.98989898989899
1821938,4,B00007M57Q,"I must say even though this movie isn't original at all, it's still a pretty entertaining movie that doesn't drag. Good kills, especially the shower kill. This movie keeps you watching, but it has ALL the cliches of all slasher films. The (...) girl, the two guys 'challenging' each other, the 'huh huh i scared you' thing.

It was not boring, but I have seen this script a thousand times. I barely give it three stars. I was suprised to find out who the killer was and the ending was a bit confusing.

1821941,4,B00007M57Q,"Well, if you have seen part one and hated it. Check this one out. I think even the directors thought part one was pretty bad. This one has almost the same storyline, but the acting is alot better (still not Emmy quality, by far) the gore is pretty up there (the opening killing scene was pretty gorey), lotts of blood, some full nudity, and the killer looks a tad bit more intimidating.
On this one they actually tell you why Trevor is killing, who he is, etc. Part one had no indications who this guy was and why he was there... That for me took alot out of the movie.

(The Plot)
It's been five years since Trevor Moorehouse terrorized Camp Placid Pines, piling up bodies like cords of wood. But now the counselors must close the camp for the winter - and they are not alone...
(The Movie)
After hearing about how bad the first movie is supposed to be, it made me want to see them. You know, to see how bad they really were. I had never gotten the chance to see the fist Bloody Murder movie until recently though I had seen Bloody Murder 2 last year. Now that I have seen both I can compare them to one another. This sequel is a step-up in every single way possible compared to its first movie. The killer looks cooler, the acting is better (but still not all that good), the atmosphere is a better (mostly at night time) and they've toned down the many ideas which were stolen from other movies.
Even though this film seems like your typical, low-budget slasher movie there's something about Trevor Moorehouse that kept me thinking. I still don't know if it was actually him doing the killings or someone just trying to imitate him like in the first movie. Either it's intentional or they forgot to clear that up in the second movie, which was probably the case as I doubt the people responsible for this film are rocket scientists. I'll just leave it with a guess, Trevor Moorehouse did it.
If you enjoyed the first film, you can't go wrong with this one. If you didn't like the first film but enjoy slasher movies, give it a try. If you don't like slasher movies in general, don't bother with this.
(The DVD)
Nothing about the DVD surprises me. The picture quality is average, can't always expect perfection from a straight-to-video movie which I think was shot on video instead of film. You also get a 5.1 Dolby Digital audio track for the film, so that's decent I guess.
The extras on this disc are what I like to call ""extras for idiots"", they're not really extras. The picture gallery is just a bunch of stills taken from the movie, nothing which you can't see by pausing at the right moment in the movie. There are a few theatrical trailers, nothing fancy and also something called ""Jump To A Bloody Murder"" which they actually surprised me with. With this extra I thought it'd just be a way of watching the death scenes from the featured movie without having to skip ahead but instead it's 3 full scenes of people being killed from the first film. These were the best scenes from the first film, when I say ""best"" it still doesn't mean they were any good though.",1086912000,,2518,4.476086956521739
1821949,4,B00007M57Q,BM2 was very well done! Better acting. More Twists! And One Hell Of A Fun Time!,1084406400,,79,4.0
1821950,3,B00007M57Q,"As I say I expected better film,but it is OK.It has some cool gory moments/finally someone use chainsaw and machetes/,perfect setting/I love woods and camps/,but somewhere in the middle it has too much asking,talking,young detectives and so. But as I say it has his moments,and it is totally OK.",1080000000,,295,5.040816326530612
1821951,2,B00007M57Q,"This movie has the originality of a FogHat set. We have a masked killer running around the woods chopping up counselors. Sound familiar to anyone? (*hint Jason Voorhees). However this is misleading. On the cover, 'Trevor' has a hockey mask and a hook. In the movie, the dude wears overalls, a black hood, and a Michael Myers mask. Instead of drowning as a boy, he was dumped in a ravine. No vengeful mother here, it's the daddy.
Also we have not one, but two surviving females. Neither of them had any nude scenes. It was the chick who got butchered (the ugliest) who had the nudie scenes. The redhead with the huge knockers said she wouldn't die right in the movie! As long as she doesn't show her breasts, she'll live. And we have the token black guy who says he'll die because he's black (he learned this in horror movies 101, don't worry he explains all this to you too.)
The first kill with the smart-mouthed college brat getting his legs cut off was the best kill. Everything else was kind of lame, and the whole beeper thing got old.
All in all this is a brainless slasher movie that borrows heavily on every slasher movie ever made. As a salute to 80's horror flicks, it's a decent tribte. As a movie to stand on it's own, it fails miserably.",1077494400,,1250,4.415584415584416
1821952,3,B00007M57Q,"Sometime back in August, I believe, I watched the first installment in this budding franchise and followed that unpleasant experience with a scathing review. For me, ""Bloody Murder"" exemplified every failing a horror film can fall into if it is not careful: stilted dialogue, a weak plot that moves with the speed of a runaway glacier, bland actors in roles both major and minor, and most importantly, very little in the way of gore. The first ""Bloody Murder"" didn't even have good looking young women hunted down by the killer. I am the first to admit that just because a woman is good looking does not mean she belongs in the movie business. Far from it. Just look at some of the dim bulbs invited to appear on those unctuous talk shows for no other reason than because they are ""beautiful."" But in a horror film, especially a slasher film, you need to have beautiful women running around striking poses and screaming. ""Bloody Murder"" failed miserably at what it set out to do because it had nothing worth showing a veteran horror fan. Fortunately, ""Bloody Murder 2"" rectified many of these failings, and, while far from perfect, it does merit a look or two from horror buffs.
""Bloody Murder 2"" revisits Camp Placid Pines five years after the spate of killings seen in the first picture. Once again, a group of counselors prepares to meet their doom at the hands of Trevor Moorehouse, the local legendary killer supposedly responsible for the previous group of murders. Well, anyone who saw the first film knows what role Moorehouse actually played in the crimes committed at the summer camp. Like the first film, the trouble starts when the counselors, sitting around a campfire, play a game of bloody murder in order to trick the camp owner's young friend. The game leads to an unpleasant confrontation between the dupe and one of the counselors, as well as the most gruesome killing in the movie. Things move rapidly from this point on, as bodies hit the ground in almost clinical precision. There are a few minor subplots, such as the black guy explaining why he will die horribly (because black guys always die in horror movies) and the lead character's dreams about her dead brother Jason. None of these really matter, though, because the majority of the film deals with the systematic destruction of all of these young people.
This film is hardly the archetype of originality in this genre. The twist ending is unconvincing and not all that interesting, and of course it leaves everything open for yet another sequel. The shower scene, and you will know what I am talking about when you see it, shamelessly rips off ""Silence of the Lambs"" when it does the old switcheroo bit. In that film this technique worked on every level, but in ""Bloody Murder 2"" it is merely an attempt to evoke a cheap thrill. Regarding the villain, Trevor Moorehouse fails to rise above your typical slasher film killer. The guy wears a Michael Myer's type mask with overalls and hood, hardly an original concept at this point in the game. At least Moorehouse delivers when it comes to killing: the first murder is not only exceptionally gory; it is also cruel on a level not often seen in horror films nowadays. After this spectacular opening, the movie backs off a bit in the gore department, but ""Bloody Murder 2"" is still light years ahead of its lame predecessor in this area.
Special mention goes to Katy Woodruff, the actress who plays lead character Tracy Hathaway. Woodruff is definitely not a spectacular thespian, but she stands head and shoulders above anyone who appeared in the first film. Moreover, she's definitely great in the eye candy department. Throw in Tiffany Shepis as the catty Angela and Amanda Magarian as the gorgeous yet underutilized Sophie, and you have the makings of a fine film sure to entertain every adolescent male in the audience. Perhaps I noticed how nice looking these three young ladies were because I recently watched several slasher films filled with Plain Janes. Whatever the reason is, these three women definitely stand out in what is otherwise a fairly average horror film. The male cast members do not stand out in any way, with the exception of the guy doing an unintentionally amusing impression of Ryan Phillippe's character from ""I Know What You Did Last Summer.""
The DVD edition of ""Bloody Murder 2"" works more often than not. I had some problems with the picture quality of the transfer, which I thought looked grainy for such a recent film. Moreover, director Rob Spera should have fired the lighting crew because all of the night scenes look bad. Even many of the daytime shots look awful, leading me to believe that someone didn't know that you still need lighting when filming scenes in the sun. While there is no commentary track on the disc, there are four trailers for films ranging from ""Wendigo"" to the first Moorehouse movie. Also included are a few murder clips from the first ""Bloody Murder,"" which should serve as a reminder of how much better this film is than its forerunner. I won't make any stellar claims for ""Bloody Murder 2,"" but certain elements of the movie do work on occasion. If you must see a ""Bloody Murder"" picture, skip the first installment and move straight into this one.",1066694400,2,5242,4.774229074889868
1821953,1,B00007M57Q,"My boyfriend and I rented this film mainly because of the cover. Neither of us had seen the first ""Bloody Murder"", but we figured that it wasn't necessary. What we got was a very predictable and almost laughable attempt at a horror movie. From what I've read in reviews about the first movie, this one is supposed to be much, much better. That's amazing to me because this one was terrible. The acting is absolutely horrible and the plot is very predictable. I and my boyfriend were able to figure out who the killer was a quarter of the way into the film. Don't get me wrong, if you're in the mood for one of those stereotypical slasher films, then this is perfect. There is gore and the obligatory nudity - everything that people have grown to love in these types of film.
Overall, I would only suggest this movie if you're having a party or if you're in the mood for a good laugh.",1064793600,,883,4.357575757575757
1821954,1,B00007M57Q,"Reading the other reviews of Bloody Murder 2, I was wondering whether I missed something that I did not discover or see in that film, because I found it anything but original and scary. I have not seen the first installment (Thank God for that),so I can not compare the two films, but I can safely say that it is one of the worst I have seen for a long while.
Loving movies as I do, and all the genres, I really tried hard to find a redeeming feature that would make it 'watchable', but for the life of me could not find one.(except maybe finding Katy Woodruff very pretty!)
The acting? The actors must have learned their craft with a carpenter, because it is so wooden, and the lines delivered as if reciting in a spelling contest.
The direction? It is so bad, it makes 'Troma films' directors look like Stanley Kubrick.
As for the sript and story, the slasher Friday the 13th off shoots litter the straight to video market, some good, others watchable, and some others plain awful. Although I will not spoil the ending for those who would enjoy this film ,and I respect other viewer's opinion, I really felt that it was a complete waste of time and money.
Save your dollars for far better films, and give this one a miss with a capital M.",1057795200,,1240,4.372294372294372
1821955,4,B00007M57Q,"The first ""Bloody Murder"" movie was a pretty routine ""Friday the 13th"" retread.  It wasn't that it was bad; it just lacked any real originality.  ""Bloody Murder 2"" on the other hand, is a well crafted little horror film.  The pacing is a big improvement over the first, which tended to drag along.  This is a credit to the director(replacing original ""Bloody Murder"" director Ralph Portillo).
Overall, it seems that a lot of effort was put into making this a quality horror film that can stand alone rather than just a by-the-numbers sequel.  Don't be put off by the derivative cover art.  ""Bloody Murder 2"" is a solid chiller with enough plot twists to keep it fresh.",1055808000,,668,4.666666666666667
1821956,3,B00007M57Q,"Not too long ago, my friend rented a pile of horror movies she randomly picked out at the video store, and this was the first one that caught my attention.  Just from the cover, it looked like an extremly cheap and typical horror film, but I wasn't just ready to judge it.  We put it in the DVD player and started to watch it.
At the beginning, I was thinking how cheesy it was.  And I have to admit, the first REAL killing scene (right after they start playing their little game of Bloody Murder, some kind of hind-and-go-seek in the woods thing) was a bit laughable.
Also, my friend and I both agreed that the killer looks in no way scary.  He/She looks like a gardener (blue overalls, gloves, hiking boots) with a hockey mask on.  Don't be deceived by the cover of the movie; the killer never even uses a hook in the actual film nor wears a red shirt.
Anyhow, as I watched more of the movie, I realized how un-typical it was becoming because there were so many suspects as to who the killer could be.  And at the climax, there is an extremly large plot twist which makes this movie good.
However, one major thing that brings my rating of the movie down to three stars is the often fake acting in the film.
Nevertheless, the movie was pretty enjoyable, and I recomend it to those of you who enjoy the nature of cheap""er"" horror films and need something to watch on a weekend at night.",1054598400,,1386,4.291187739463601

7978262,5,B00007M57Q,"Five years have passed since the last series of murders at Lake Placid Pines. The camp is 3 days away from closing up for the summer.  This time the focal character is Jason's sister Tracy.  Tracy has been having recurring nightmares about her brother and her camp friend Sofie has been privy to her nightmares as well as concerned.  Their camp boss Rick introduces everyone to a young student named James, of whom he employed to help them with the countless tasks that they must accomplish before going home.  Tracy her boyfriend Mike, Ryan, Ryan's girlfriend Angela, token African American Elvis, and James are all sitting at the campfire, there's a discussion of Trevor Moorehouse, when a game of Bloody Murder is recommended.  Tracy opts out and Mike follows her to talk with her.  James is the one chosen to be blindfolded and count before he skulks about to look for them.  Mike and Ryan play a prank on James, and James gets edgy with Ryan over the prank.  While everyone else goes to bed, James stays by the campfire and drinks a little.  It isn't long before Trevor stalks and kills James.  No one knows that James is dead and someone leaves a fake note for him.  The sheriff and his deputies are present and hopefully can protect them from Trevor.  As Trevor Moorehouse is roaming the campgrounds of Lake Placid Pines the body count is soon to rise.  Hopefully Tracy can save the day before it's too late.

The night scenes are wonderfully lit and the fog is very cool and effectively creepy.

The musical score is very dramatic and no non-sense in how intensely dark and frightening it is.

The gore that you get is very believable and well crafted.  The kill scenes are also very enjoyable and prove Trevor to be very handy with his weapons and at the same very time resourceful with anything that he can find.  The stalker and chase scenes are incredibly intriguing and exciting, also.  The first person camera perspectives, quick close ups, and the 180 degree pans after Tracy has a nightmare, are all great tributes to the classic slashers.

The cast are very attractive people and the women(in particular) couldn't be hotter.  Tracy, Sofie, and Angela all prove to be drop dead gorgeous and seriously habanero hot.  Their tight pants and short shirts showing their midriffs are just plain hot wardrobes.

There's not alot of nudity or sex scenes, but all the sizzling hotness that sexy Tiffany Shepis(Angela) provides in her nude and steamy hot sex scenes more than make up for that.  She flaunts it and wears it well.

It was interesting that they gave Trevor Moorehouse a completely different mask this time.  Don't go by the cover, he isn't wearing his hockey mask this time.

The characters weren't as interesting or as well developed in this movie as they were in the first Bloody Murder, but that doesn't really spoil the fun, all the same.  Please note that any surviving characters from part 1 are not in this movie, that is except for Jason.

Overall, this proves to be another loving tribute to the old school of slashers.  The movie provides a creepy atmosphere, a feeling of isolation, a tough as nails killer, stalking, gore, cool kill scenes, a freaky score, beautiful and sexy people, sex, nudity, chase scenes, good editing, classic camera perspectives and pans, well lit night scenes, and even some surprising mystery/twist ending to it as well.  If all of that is your thing than this one's definitely for you.",1445904000,,3444,4.728187919463087

Coming to Placid Pines is most difficult for Tracy, whose brother Jason was one of Trevor's first victims. Haunted by her nightmares, Tracy tries to face her worst fears. When the counselors decide to play a game of Bloody Murder after a few drinks, the results are threatening and deadly as Trevor Moorhouse decides to rear his ugly head upon them. One by one, the counselors are brutally murdered til few remain.  Just who is Trevor Moorehouse? And, will he show his real face? You'll have to find out yourself by watching the movie, lol.

While the first movie had very little gore or scary moments to it, Bloody Murder 2: Closing Camp has plenty going for the slasher fan. In fact, it's loaded with alot more to make it more to your liking for a slasher flick, like; violence, language, nudity, and strong sexual content.

It's a great movie, one I recommend you watch. As far as series go, I hope they continue with it. I'm interested in finding out who Trevor Moorhouse is and just what he looks like.",1350000000,,1108,4.557788944723618

7978266,4,B00007M57Q,"Trevor Moorehouse is back for the closing of summer camp. Tracy (Katy Woodruff), who lost a brother (literally they can't find him) 5 years ago is having reoccurring nightmares. There is a new guy in the camp too. His name is Jason (Tyler Sedustine). Several of the scenes were simply remakes from the first movie. Tracy slinks around in tight shorts and sporting some high beams, but always has an excuse not to put out to her bf Mike (Kelly Gunning, so we know she lives. Even though she awakes with cold sweats it is Angela (Tiffany Shepis) who showers with friends and has sex, so she must die according to the slasher movie code. Far, far, better than the first one.

I liked Katy Woodruff. I would liked to have seen her in more horror movies.

7978267,4,B00007M57Q,"First off, I'll agree that the plot is similar to many other slasher movies: teens have sex then get butchered by a masked maniac. However one of the things that I like about the movie is that the camp setting was slightly active while normally, like in Friday the 13th, the camp is inactive (minus Jason lives). The other is that normally it's one person who lives. In this one, it's two. And I think it was shot beautifully, minus that one part where it has a cloudy scene that looks like a backdrop. And I love the long line of weapons Trevor uses instead of using one primary weapon. For the record, I have yet to see the first one, but I'm eagerly waiting for it in the mail, despite what I've heard heard about it. But for this movie, I'll say this: Is the story original? No, but it does succeed to entertain. And to me, it's not so much a rip off as many people call it. More along the lines of a parody, a mix up of Friday the 13th (obviously), Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Halloween. Would I recommend this movie? You bet. And guys who hate it, it could have been worst: It could have been made by Uwe Boll.",1288742400,,1117,4.2
7978268,4,B00007M57Q,"I got this movie strictly because It contains horror-goddess Tiffany Shepis (Delta Delta Die!, The Hazing, Abominable, Home Sick, etc.). Ms. Shepis has plenty of screen time, both clothed and sans attire. This beautiful creature never disappoints, (even when a particular movie she's in happens to stink). In BLOODY MURDER 2, Tiffany plays the wild Angela, a slutty gal w/ a heart of gold. While not the central female character, Angela is the most interesting of the bunch. BM2 is a decent film anyway, w/ its masked murderer and ample supply of knife-fodder. A fun way to waste a Saturday afternoon...",1242950400,,603,4.98019801980198

7978270,3,B00007M57Q,"When I was renting a few videos they said I could grab two more to get the cheaper rental deal they had going, and I had glanced at this films cover when selecting the others in the horror movie section, and I figured, ""what the hell""

When I first put it on, the story of camp councilors in the woods telling ghost stories of a psychopath that was killed out there and then returned to take his revenge on those that let him die sounded all too familiar (ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma)

Even hearing the heroin's murdered brother of the movie was named Jason. And their friend Mike (Myers was it?) seemed to be really pushing the limits to me either saying, ""this is a cheesy fan made horror movie of the slasher genre, or a complete rip off of Friday The 13th. [not to forget, a Jason type of mask is worn for a prank]

However, even tho I would definitely say this is the creators version of a Friday The 13th film, by the time it ended, I thought it was not too bad, and one of the better copycat type of films for this genre.

The plot of the movie is about some councilors who have just finished looking after the kids for the summer, the children have gone home and there sticking around for the last couple of days to pack up the campsite to go home. They tell a story of Trevor Moorhouse, who was killed by councilors and came back to seek his revenge.

I guess that might have been the plot of the first movie, which I have not seen. So hopefully I will be able to track that one down and see if it was as good as it's sequel. After this ghost story, the councilors don't believe the story, except for one of them, but they soon find themselves in jeopardy in the typical slasher stalks them in the woods and cabins motif.

While it is a copy-cat of Friday The 13th, it portrays it in it's own way, not copying every element that makes that slasher series and instead of just using the kill for the hell of killing plot, you get to know these characters better then a Friday The 13th movie where it's all ""no one will help us, we have to do it ourselves"" to a more believable scenario.

The gore fans may enjoy some of the bloody kills in this. For a low budget movie that starts off looking like a cheap copy-cat independent film eventually involves into an entertaining horror/thriller with plenty of action, suspense and a ""who done it"" that was not the most predictable thing for you to work out.

I did not figure out who the killer was till the end scenes, so it may take you a while to figure it out too. However, If I was making this movie, I might have gone for a better ending, or more drawn out. It seemed to be pretty quick, and that's about the only downfall of the movie.

However, I still give it 4 stars It was pretty entertaining, the characters aren't the annoying airheads you usually find in these slasher films that just say something stupid, don't believe what's going on, show there naked body and get gutted.

Tho as usual, it does go for some unneeded nudity, at least it's only the one woman, and not every one of them leaving you thinking, ""God, is this how the expected to get people to see this with an actor who can't act but shows her breasts at the drop of a hat?""

Overall, I think the Friday The 13th fans like myself will see it's not a direct rip off, but more a nod to those movies, and says clearly, ""this was made by a fan of slasher movies, but it's done pretty well""",1214697600,,3405,4.223076923076923
