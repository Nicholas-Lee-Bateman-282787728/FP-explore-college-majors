7904777,5,B000006QIO,"I purchased this video because I wanted to know more about Andy Griffith as a person, although I'm sure many folks wanted it as an addition to their Mayberry artifacts. Andy's pre-Mayberry days were explored in-depth and, of course, the entire Griffith Show saga was well-covered. I would have liked more insight into the period between 1968 and the late '70s, when Andy took roles in such departures as 1973's ""Pray for the Wildcats"". However, Biography did a nice job of cramming a lot of information into a one-hour program.",1005091200,3,527,4.866666666666666
