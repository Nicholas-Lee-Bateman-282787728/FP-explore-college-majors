8098046,5,B000CDWGU2,I purchased this to train new employees in my bike shop and found it to be very helpful. Easy to see and understand.,1356652800,,116,4.086956521739131
8098047,5,B000CDWGU2,"Excellent guides, extremely easy to follow and understand, although a few sections where a torque wrench would help.

I watched this guide and serviced both of my road and mountain bikes the very first time with 0 problems.",1327363200,,223,4.868421052631579
8098048,4,B000CDWGU2,"I have to say it was very informative, and simple to follow. The only piece that was really left out was removing / changing the headset / forks.

Else it would have gotten 5 stars ..",1307232000,,183,4.083333333333333
8098049,5,B000CDWGU2,"If you are like me and mechanically illiterate, but still determined to work on bikes then this is a great DVD to add to your library.  I had purchased a number of bike repair books, but seeing someone actually doing the task makes a huge difference.

I think Jeff does an excellent job of covering each task in a very simple and direct way.  He has a very down to earth approach and I appreciated that.

If you are interested in learning more about bicycles, I would recommend the following:

However, it also covers how to build a work bench for your garage and has a great chapter on how to tear down a bike.

8098050,3,B000CDWGU2,"I bought the ""Bike Garage"" DVD because my wife and I just upgraded our bikes, and a good friend advised to learn how to repair flats because, ""nobody gets a flat tire while their bike is in the garage.""  Good advice!

I can say that, for the most part, the instructions are pretty easy to follow, although: 1. I wouldn't attempt 90% of the repairs they demonstrate, and 2. they didn't show how to remove and then replace a rear wheel w/ deralliuer that has a flat - my #1 concern.  Oh well, I remembered enough from my childhood days that the DVD was a sufficient refresher (I hope!).

In terms of production and navigation, the DVD is relatively amateurish.  However, there are good, tight shots that clearly show what they are doing.  In the end, I didn't buy this to be a Friday night's video entertainment, anyway.  So, it's good enough - jump cuts and bad host aside.

If you want to learn just enough to do the ""MUST"" repairs to your bike, this will do well.",1249862400,2,964,4.376404494382022
8098051,4,B000CDWGU2,This Video has lots of useful info. If you really have no idea what to do this may save you altogether. DVD bike wrench school for the beginner! I am glad I bought it.,1240963200,,167,3.9411764705882355
8098052,5,B000CDWGU2,"Can't describe the service from this seller, talked to Jeff and ordered the DVD from Amazon and within a few days it was here. Good basic info with some tricks of the trade thrown in. For the money the DVD can't be beat and dealing with Jeff was a pleasure. This and Zinns DVD offer more than enough information to do what I need to do and it is always easier to see something done for me anyhow. Very pleased with the whole transaction.",1178755200,5,437,4.214285714285714
8098053,5,B000CDWGU2,"I think Bike Garage is a must have for anybody who wants to do there own repairs on their bike and have fun doing it.  I am a big fan of how the video is layed out.  The main menu is sorted out by certain sections of the bike that you want to work on and then on individual parts of the bike you want to learn about.

Watching the video you can tell that Jeff Millenson clearly knows what he is talking about.  Either you have never lifted a wrench before or you are a wrench, Jeff has layed out the video in a way that does not intimidate you to not want to tackle your bike issues.

As a former bicycle mechanic my self, I would find customers all the time that wanted to learn how to do certain repairs them selfs that found them in the local bike shop once every few weeks.  I watched several videos and read countless books on bike repair in hopes of finding something that I could recomend to customers that wanted to work on there own bikes.  What I noticed  is that either these sources were too basic and cheesy or too advanced and no matter what the customer still found themselves in the bike shop right after watching the video or reading the book.

Bike Garage just came out but I wish I had it to recomend to people when I had the chance.  It is a really well put together source of information.",1134518400,31,1309,4.118110236220472
