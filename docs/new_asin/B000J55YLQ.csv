2667298,5,B000J55YLQ,"If you are looking for a ""How to be a Merc"" documentary, this is not the DVD for you.

If you are curious about Blackwater, EO etc, Mark Thatcher's arrest and the whole notion of ""Guns for Hire"", then this is a fascinating, unbiased (as unbiased as any report can be on a hot-button issue) and compelling look at the industry.

The micro and macro are covered in great detail. History, both over the long and short term, are covered to provide a context as to ""...how the business got to where it is now"". Then through interviews (ala Errol Morris), we get well edited commentary from professionals as to the state of Iraq (where 90% of mercs now are) and the industry as a whole.

The most telling comment/indictment can be gleaned from the one South African who said,""There comes a point in battle when soilders must advance and they don't want to. An army can compel them. A merc cannot be compelled, and so will walk away"". If nations continue to outsource low-intensity proxy conflicts to private contractors, at some point national interests will not be served. The long term implications of this are too complex to envisage, but we are headed in that direction.

One complaint - no subtitles. At least English, for viewers who are not native speakers of English, trying to wade through a thick South African accent.",1168214400,,1322,4.660944206008583

I was expecting a good video commented story of how things are with Mercs. More of a story of a guy sitting in a chair talking about his life. Some of the other reviews says this video kinda goes know where. Yes I agree with that. I still haven't finished watching it. Save your money netflix, blockbuster video it. Or wait for it to come on TV or cable. Beter yet Bit-torrent it...

2667301,5,B000J55YLQ,"After Fahrenheit 9/11 and ""When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts"" I feared the political documentary genre was forever lost in liberal bias. Shadow Company restores this genre to its rightful place of respectability.

Far too often documentary film makers shape their films to fit their predetermined conclusions and present only the footage that backs up their premise. Shadow Company takes a fair and balanced approach that few filmmakers, or news outlets for that matter, have the courage and integrity to take.

Shadow Company is an extremely insightful, educational, and entertaining look at a remarkable and very controversial event in contemporary politics and modern warfare. Anyone hoping to have a well informed conversation about the war in Iraq needs to see this film.  Conservatives and liberals alike will call it one of their favorite films of the year.",1162252800,5,876,5.242857142857143
2667302,5,B000J55YLQ,"First I must say that I am in the film as an interview subject but I encourage anyone who wants to understand how warfare is shifting from the citizen soldier to the hired gun to watch this film.

Kudos to Nick and Jason on their first film and the professional look and feel of the project.

The documentary ties together the links between mercenaries, contractors and soldier and goes inside the minds and feelings of men who choose this way of life. And maybe more importantly, inside the hearts of people who are affected by this violent profession.",1162166400,8,553,4.63265306122449
2667303,5,B000J55YLQ,"This is a review of the DVD.

Shadow Company is a compelling film about men for hire who go into very

dangerous places in the world to act as security agents for companies;

to fight for governments; or whoever hires them. They are apolitical

and are seemingly very good at what they do. The film takes no sides,

doesn't pull any punches, shows us just how dangerous and bloody

fighting in todays troubled hot spots is.

Some graphic footage of burning bodies may be disturbing but it did

happen. There are about 20,000 mercenaries in Iraq at present. Others

are in African countries where there is civil war. Some are in

Afghanistan; or any place that is dangerous and there is need for

men-with-guns; i.e. security agents.

Film-makers Nick Bicanic and Jason Bourque were successful in getting

the complete cooperation and trust of the mercenaries, called private

security contractors, and through interviews and following along, we

have a look at their day. Two of them, (Slavko Itic & Corbus Claassens)

are articulate and matter-of-fact about the way things are in their

jobs. The most horrific details are recounted with no histrionics. It

is just the way it is. The extras are a great watch too. One long

interview with Claassens recounts a hilarious story about a blow up

doll. It's odd and a little scary. If the the guy in their company was

just kidding, it would be one thing. But it sounded like he actually

had conversations and 'fights' with his 'wife.' Yes, folks, he married

his 'doll.' I won't spoil the rest of the story by further comment, but

it is seriously strange - and very funny.

The commentary by Nick and his partner, Jason, gives some more insight

into what they did and why they picked certain parts and places to film

. And how a lot of the film is shot in natural light and why.

All in all I am so glad I had a 'headsup' on this film. Interesting

subject which needs to be explored. Interesting people I for one would

never have known about. Thought provoking. I rated it 10/10.",1162166400,24,2034,4.616246498599439
2667304,5,B000J55YLQ,"""Shadow Company"" presents an honest, even-handed look at the use of contracted ""special forces"" in modern warfare.  Many people are unaware or unclear of the role of these corporate soldiers and support personel and this documentary does an excellent job of describing what they do and who they do it for without making political judgements.  Mercenaries have been part of armies for centuries but the modern movie version of these guys often overshadows the reality of how these forces are used and who the men are who choose to be part of them.  ""Shadow Company"" was interesting and enlightening without being pedantic or politically one-sided.  What you think of the use of paid soldiers and support personnel is up to you but at least after watching this excellent documentary you might have a better idea of what you're talking about.  ""Shadow Company"" does raise questions of concern, but nothing anyone looking at this issue would not want to consider.  Whatever side of the political fence you're on, I believe ""Shadow Company"" can provide a good grounding of unsensational information upon which to make considered judgements.  I highly recommend it.",1162166400,5,1159,5.1005291005291005
2667305,5,B000J55YLQ,"Shadow Company is an extremely well-made documentry film, which tells of the roles of these contract soldiers who are fighting along side our military Iraq and Sierra Leone. I had heard stories of contract soldiers, or mercenaries, but had no idea how important a role they played until this film. Nick Bicanic and all those involved in putting together this wonderful account, should be praised for their efforts in putting the truth of what is going on over there out, which is a far cry from what the media wants us to see. It's something every American should watch, as well as being shown in the schools. The interviews from some of the journalists, contract workers, and even Stephen J. Cannell, a Hollywood Producer, well known to American TV, are very informative. An added treat to the film is the voice-over reading of ""letters to home"" of one of the members of Shadow Company, James, by Scottish actor Gerard Butler, who adds a real touch of humanity and heart to the film. This is one documentry that holds your interest and doesn't waiver or let you down. I hightly recommend this DVD to every American who supports, or not, the efforts of our fighting men in the Middle East, with praises for these brave and wonderful non-Military contract soldiers, who are helping so wonderfully in the overall effort there.

2667323,4,B000J55YLQ,"One of the most overt downsides to this otherwise enlightening and informative documentary is the lack of historical context provided, in terms of both ""mercenaries"" as well as the history of the activities of PMCs existing before Operation Iraqi Freedom. Historical examples are provided but are very general in nature, especially regarding the conditions surrounding their activities. The precedent set forth by Executive Outcomes in regards to potential future utilization of similar PMCs, as well as the potential political/military fallout would have been useful to know. I personally would recommend watching the History Channels documentary called ""Soldiers For Hire"" in order to have some measure of understanding of the history and global politics surrounding the activities of PMCs to date. Cobus Claasens and P.W. Singer are featured in that documentary as well.

It is fair to say that proper utilization of PMCs is limited to employment of a PMC by a nation-state or body politic, with the regulation, controls and oversight that result from the nature of this kind of employment, vs employment by a private entity where these regulatory elements are questionable if even present.

The strength of this documentary is the inclusion of the anecdotes and opinions of the contractors themselves. This inclusion is important because it balances out the somewhat negative views many of the journalists have of PMCs, due in no small part to an inherent lack of understanding of the culture and operational environment inherent within the historically successful PMCs such as EO. People fear PMCs because they do not understand the way they work and associate the negative stereotypes perpetrated by media smear campaigns, like the ones against EO, with the PMCs of today. Sensationalist journalism in regards to PMCs and ""mercenaries"" in general are an example of this.

The documentary is highly informative and worth viewing, and does provide an important insight into PMCs in a way that is available to the general public.",1302998400,2,2032,5.32398753894081

2667328,3,B000J55YLQ,"Objectivity is a curious word indeed, and describing this documentary as an ""objective and balanced"" look at the issue of ""mercenaries for hire"" requires that one subjectively persuade one's Self to ignore the core issues inherent in the profitable business of war.

Any overt discussion of personal and corporate MOTIVES is avoided in this film, and one is carried along on a seemingly placid wave of purely intellectual 'detachment' carefully crafted into the pacing of the documentary. All seems calm, rational, and objective (despite the 'action sequences' and 'war toys') until the last half of the tale. Then, suddenly, we are 'treated' to a few moments of subjective feeling by way of an interview with an attractive white woman recounting the tragic story of her love for a hired contractor who is killed protecting his 'client'. She struggles hard and succedes at holding back her tears as she tells her tale in close up to the camera. We see the charred and mutilated remains of her lover/husband (?) laying on the desert road in Iraq.

This scene is the only scene in the entire film that calls our attention to personal feelings, but they are the personal feelings of a white woman for her lover/husband (?) -a white man (I couldn't be sure whether they were married to each other or not, but I do know that HE was married and 'loved his family' because this 'objective' film told me so!) Now, call me subjective or crazy but I found this to be a highly ""unbalanced"" approach to the death that often permeates the film. No tender feelings of compassion are ever elicited from me regarding all the mangled bodies of Iraqis floating past the camera, and I never witness ANY Iraqi (whether man or woman or child) being shown even a moment of human compassion. I guess that's what ""objective"" and ""well balanced"" means.

In fact, this viewer found the film to be highly enamored of these Private Military Companies and their spotlighted ""Soldiers of Fortune"". They are depicted (quite one-sidedly) as rather noble if sometimes confused chaps just doing their jobs as the hired guns and dogs of war. After all, we are treated to a Lady Scholar with a British seeming accent informing us that ""Mercenaries are the oldest profession"" (though I always heard that the 'whores' were the oldest profession -but, then again, I suppose there might be some sort of unspecified connection between hired, mercenary 'dogs of war' and whores.) So yeah, this British seeming Lady informs us that as the great Medieval Wars came to a close there were ""companies"" of soldier-mercenaries who wandered down into Italy and proved to be ""a stimulus to the economy."" They practically ""gave us the Rennaisance"" itself, single handedly! Ah, the glories these poor, misunderstood (but thoroughly 'professional') thugs up for sale to the highest bidder have wrought upon this Earth! Can you say Amen, Brothers and Sisters?

Don't get me wrong, while I think that 'Shadow Company' could more accurately be titled 'Shadow Propaganda' I'm not at all certain that Nick Bicanic deliberately crafted it to be propaganda. It's just that his unconscious, subjective side got the better of him and he inadvertently made this very minor little masterpiece as a euphemistic employee or consultant for the mercenaries.

Somehow, the scene that stays longest with me after having viewed the film is the one where a fat faced, blue eyed white guy dressed in suit and tie opines thusly: ""We believe that peace keeping, peace ENFORCEMENT is probably the biggest market for the private sector in the future"".

Mister Bicanic went shopping to make a documentary. I think he may have stumbled upon the rather mercenary ""Coalition of the Billing"" who provided the subtitle for this objective and well balanced masterpiece: ""Shadow Propaganda; The Coalition of The Billing"".

But hey, don't take my word for it, I'm thoroughly subjective and congenitally allergic to anything posturing as ""objective"". I felt the film to be ""asset stripping"" as well as a kind of subtle ""corporate raid"" on my psyche. Rather like a ""hostile takeover"". Whew! Glad that's over with and done.

PS: I give it 3 stars for its technical competence and the director's skill at aping objectivity. Don't neglect to view the extra added attraction billed as a ""conference"" on the DVD: it's Nick and an illustrious company of three other white men: a certain ""Senior Fellow From Center For American Progress, a guy from the ""Brookline Institute"", and the ""Director, US Operations, Hart Group Security.""

2667330,5,B000J55YLQ,"Every time I watch a documentary these days I can feel myself anticipating the moment when I really get the point the film makers are trying to Convince me of. It's like when I'm driving and I get that first little bit of road rage and suddenly I can feel myself looking for more reasons to get angrier and angrier. A lot of film makers play to your emotions, anger and fear being the best ones in my opinion, and I know I often get hooked in and by the end of the documentary I definitely have an opinion that was formed by the presentation of the info. It has made me biased.

SHADOW COMPANY is different. The info is presented in a way that plays to a person's intellect, not to their emotions. They carefully examine the information and allow you to make a decision for yourself.

The quality of the interviews is incredible. They are honest, heartfelt and true, not directed by the film makers to make a point. Having read some of Robert Pelton's books I can appreciate his knowledge and really enjoyed hearing his opinion.

The directing and editing is amazing. Early on I got a feeling of the vision that went into the creation of this film and felt how it carried through right through to the credits.

2667331,5,B000J55YLQ,"Whether you're a hawk or a dove; a privatization booster or a socialist,  Shadow Company is a must-see.  Obviously inspired by P.W. Singer's ""Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry"" (also a must read), these film makers have upheld the ethic of presenting well-balanced, non-judgmental material for the intelligent viewer to assess on their own. This is thought-provoking documentary film making and an accessible vehicle for creating awareness and generating conversations in the mainstream about this recent development in global military history.

A documentary like this exposes people to the system and all of the paradox that goes with it.  Would the Rwandan genocide have happened the way it did had the UN accepted a bid from an outfit like Executive Outcomes? Could stability be achieved in Sudan now? Will a privatized military create more problems than it solves over time?

This whole issue presents a new level of complexity for systems and economies that are already vested and embedded in the military-industrial complex. The basic unit of input and the organizing principle for a privatized military is deadly violent conflict or, at least, ongoing volatile security situations. As interests continue to be vested, the short term economic and political self-interest benefits are clear, but the need for more deadly violent conflict to sustain the business interests is also clear. What happens in the long term will be very interesting... especially in places that don't get as much attention as Iraq and Afghanistan - e.g. places like Nigeria, Guyana, and Sudan (again).

This film generated a great deal of questions and ideas for conversation for me... which I think is the highest praise. Looking forward to more work from these film makers.",1169078400,3,1788,5.278169014084507

8149299,4,B000J55YLQ,"""Shadow Company"" is a documentary about the proliferation of private military companies (PMCs) and the ethical and legal questions it implies, written and directed by Nick Bicanic and Jason Bourque. The film addresses the questions raised by PMCs by topic, not narratively, with interviews with private military contractors and experts intercut with photos and video footage of the PMCs in action. This is framed by actor Gerard Butler reading from the letters of James Ashcroft, who was a military contractor in Iraq and wrote the book ""Making a Killing: The Explosive Story of a Hired Gun in Iraq"" (2010) about his experiences. Ashcroft's story provides some respite from the interview format, but I didn't feel that it contributed anything of significance to the film.

The filmmakers interview some thoughtful individuals on the topic of modern PMCs and mercenary soldiers, including researchers, authors, private military contractors, and even Stephen J. Cannell, who produced the television show ""The A-Team"" in the 1980s. Those interviewed include Peter W. Singer, political analyst with the Brookings Institution, Robert Young Pelton, journalist renowned for his reporting from war zones and high-risk environments, Cobus Claassens, a security contractor formerly with Executive Outcomes, Alan Bell, president of Globe Risk International, and John F. Mullins, US veteran and private military contractor who advised the video game ""Soldier of Fortune."" Pelton is particularly thoughtful. I would have liked to hear more from ethicist Eike Kluge.

""Shadow Company"" attempts to answer a series of questions about modern mercenaries, mostly by interviewing people and presenting viewers with statistics. The first is ""Why do they do it?"", which begins with a brief history of the mercenary in warfare and the negative connotations associated with them, then goes on to explain, simplistically, the formation of Executive Outcomes by former South African Defense Force officers in the late 1980s. Executive Outcomes set the standard for PMCs and was one of few that operated offensively (in Africa) rather than defensively (security contractors) or by providing training. The second question is ""What do they do?"" This is answered by explaining the economics of PMCs and interviewing private contractors, themselves.

""Who are they?"" is the next question, leading to a discussion of where the private contractors or mercenaries come from, why they do it, and the considerable number of posers in the industry. There is also a brief discussion of the attempted coup by a PMC led by Nick du Toit at the behest of certain prominent British citizens to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea in 2004. ""How are the contracts chosen?"" looks at the legal, financial, and moral criteria that PMCs may use in deciding whether or not to take a job. This leads to a discussion of private military contractors killed in Iraq. ""What happens next?"" allows pundits and contractors alike to propose how PMCs might be regulated and what role would be appropriate for them to serve in the future.

""Shadow Company"" raises interesting points, but the presentation is often awkward, and it barely scratches the surface of some of the most interesting topics, such as the legitimacy of Executive Outcomes' actions in Sierra Leone, where it worked for the government, or the presumed illegitimacy of the coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea, where mercenaries were employed by foreigners to overthrow a government. If nations have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force in the modern world, then it would be interesting to compare the functions of PMCs to the those of national militaries. The film only interviews one person who is absolutely against PMCs, and we don't get to hear his reasons, just his opinion. Also, the poor reputation historically afforded mercenaries was enjoyed by militaries in general and still is in much of the world. It's not just mercenaries. 3.5 stars.

A few of the reviews (specifically, negative reviews) talk about it being slow, and refer to it as a documentary. This isn't a traditional documentary, in that there were no points made directly by the writers/directors/producers. All commentary & content is delivered through interviews of historians, authors, security professionals, and combat veterans who have worked w/ Private Military Companies (PMCs).

The film has a good balance in how the content is delivered. The people behind the making of this film chose good subjects (interviewees), that complement each other.

""Shadow Company"" exposes how people commonly view mercenaries and how broad of a definition this term has. It does a good job providing a brief history of how mercenaries have been used since the beginnings of war. It  then jumps to more modern conflicts in southwestern Pacific islands, West African nations, and the Middle East (specifically, Iraq).

This is a good film for those looking for a quick introduction to mercenaries, in general. I would not recommend it for anyone expecting Rambo-style action, nor for those looking to see how PMCs like Blackwater work, operate, or train their personnel.",1466294400,,1202,5.272251308900524
