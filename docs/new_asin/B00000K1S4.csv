It is great to have available a meditative tape that we can watch at the end of a hectic day.  We enjoy it so much so that we are sending it out to our business associates and other friends as gifts -- just the right thing to say, thinking of you and wishing you peace and quiet in these troubled times.  This filmmaker has done a superlative job.",1044316800,2,509,4.163265306122449
1239854,5,B00000K1S4,"These videos are totally awesome. I have wanted to be home by the ocean again, and enjoy the beauty and peace of the sea, but life has not permitted it at this time. I have found the closest thing tho now. What a blessing!
I have bought three of these videos, and there is no favorite one. I suggest you get them all. They are so relaxing, you can almost smell the salt air.
If you want to relax, enjoy beautiful ocean scenery, seagulls, sand and surf, these are the best!!
You will not be disappointed.
Believe me I have prayed that I could find something to get rid of the stresses living in the city, and to just relax by the ocean shore, and now I have my answer. These video's take you to the most beautiful shores, where you can sit back, read, or listen to your favorite music, and not have to shake off the sand.
A beautiful work of art, this man has captured the beauty of nature.
So if you want to relax and enjoy~
I highly recommend WAVES!!

1239855,5,B00000K1S4,"This dvd California Dreams is so relaxing. Day 1 starts with San Francisco overlooking the golden gate bridge with lapping waves and a distant foghorn. Although distant this foghorn is loud enough to here thru a tv. Day 2 Monterey features huge waves and pounding surf. Waves form before other waves break. Day 3 Big Sur features waves almost as big as Montereys and numourous sea gulls. These gulls seem like they surround you and when they fly it looks like they could fly out of the tv. Day 4 Santa Barbara features mostely lapping waves but at the start you see a sky diver flying over the sea. Day 5 Santa Montica has some large waves to start with but at sunset it ends with lappers. Also I was surprised to see what appeared to be a fair with a farris wheel spinning next to the ocean. Day 6 San Diego has some pretty impressive waves to start off with but at sunset it ends with quiet lappers. The picture quality on this disc is sharp and crisp and the sound is great. I actually liked this one better than Hawaiian Dreams for three reasons. This has bigger waves,foghorns,and the San Francisco Bridge. However;if you like ocean waves you should get Hawaiian Dreams to compliment this one. Californian Dreams is one dvd you should add to your dvd collection.

I highly recommend the Caribbean,Virgin Island and Bahama waves dvds to go with the California and Hawaiia ones. Even though I haven't seen these yet I have seen some photo shots of the dvd shoot at powerfloe.com and they look breathtaking. I can't wait to get these. Greg is the first one to do one of the Caribbean,Bahamas and Virgin Islands. These will be great for people that will never be able to get to these spots.",1019260800,3,2053,4.612021857923497
1239856,5,B00000K1S4,"I loved Hawaiian Dreams. But with the spectacular cliffs, distant fog horns, and diverse California scenery, this is a very close second. However, if you enjoy watching birds, this video is definately the choice for you. The seagulls look like they're about to eat out of your hand! Luckily, they won't leave a mess on your carpet!%#!",983232000,3,334,4.87719298245614
1239857,5,B00000K1S4,"I love all the Waves videos. Hours of continuous peace. We never thought we'd feel it again! As a care-giver for my handicap dad, these tapes are our salvation. Powerful real medicine. Fastest way to distract him from  pain without using meds. Quick way for mom and me to meditate, relax or  escape. For anyone these tapes are the ultimate stress reducer with  immediate results. Instant mood altering for ones whole environment, giving  hours of peace whether you are sitting in front of it or not! Any of these  videos are a good investment, and gift especially for those on limited  budgets.",961027200,4,594,4.7745098039215685
1239858,5,B00000K1S4,"I got this video for Christmas and I love it!  After all the stress and rush of the holiday season, it was very therapeutic to relax and enjoy the sounds and sights of the beach.  I felt as if I was transported to the  beach through the television.  The director should be given an Oscar!  Thank you!  P.S. When will you make more?",946252800,5,331,4.174603174603175

7914040,5,B00000K1S4,"I bought this DVD from willdvd. It was shipped immediately and arrived in perfect condition. The video quality is excellent. I saw the other review for this page and just want to say that this DVD is the original DVD released by the producer. The person who left that other review must be trying to get people to buy his. Look for my feedback on willdvd's user profile.

This DVD shows scenes from California's Highway 1 on the stretch from San Diego to San Fransisco. It has stops in Monterey and Big Sur, among others. It has two great views of Pigeon Point Lighthouse. Also, there are several scenes where the birds are in view of the camera and you can watch them going about there business. I saw one scene that caught surfers in the water and another that caught a man parasailing. No background music just the natural sounds of the waves and wildlife. It's as if you were actually there yourself.",1250640000,3,903,4.5060975609756095
7914041,2,B00000K1S4,"This DVD looks more like poor VHS quality compared to the original DVD released by the producer.

7914043,5,B00000K1S4,"I find choosing a favorite among Greg Voevodsky's remarkable 'oevre' very near impossible. One must choose among equally stunning jewels. This one is a contender, though, because it offers pristine, unhurried views of California's awesome coastline. I've personally viewed all these places and loved them on sight: the riveting Golden Gate towering over San Francisco Bay; the astonishing rock formations of the Big Sur; the white sand and blue sky of Santa Monica; and much more.  If anything, revisiting them in Greg's elegant style is an improvement on the originals! No driving, no distractions, no searching for the ultimate view.  Greg handles all that for the viewer.  And does so with glorious finesse: long, still shots that speak for themselves; only the soft, ambient sounds of the places with their rhythmic waves and the occasional gull 'playing chicken' with the surf. To my knowledge this restrained approach is nowhere else available.  All the other nature videos, feel obliged to throw something extra in to 'enhance' the experience, all of which impresses me as 'elevator music'.  Not Greg.  He thinks the place is enough.  So do I. I'm working on collecting all his works.  Do yourself a gentle favor.  Do likewise.",1105574400,5,1234,5.13
7914044,5,B00000K1S4,I have owned this video as well as the California Zen video for a couple of years and the quality is top notch!  The sounds of the waves are relaxing and the sunsets are awesome!  This is the perfect video to watch after a long day or just when you need to get that feeling of just lying on  your favourite California beach.  Awesome!,1089676800,3,334,4.171875
7914045,5,B00000K1S4,"I have been looking for just such a video for a very long time. I have bought others,not the wave series,and been very dissapointed with their lack of beauty and quality. This video California Dreams is such a restful and beatiful video it is truly as if you are on vacation while you are watching. I plan on getting others in the series and also giving them as gifts.",1087689600,2,368,4.3478260869565215
7914046,5,B00000K1S4,"I really love this! It is so relaxing and calming.  The scenes are just breathtaking and you are mesmerized by their beauty.
As an unexpected treat, my cats love it too! They try sooo hard to get the birds and one cat will sit and watch it for hours!
I enjoy just letting it play in the background as I am working, such a wonderful sight when I look away from my computer screen for a moment. Total joy, I can't recomend this enough!",1078704000,2,433,4.154761904761905
