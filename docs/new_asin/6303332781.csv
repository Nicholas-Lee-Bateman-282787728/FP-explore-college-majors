And her birthday gift to Zack is the evil,invincible sword-swinging Knasty Knight! With Zack fighting to survive the monster's gnarly,onslaught,only the Power Rangers can possible save thier friend-and the entire planet. Not my favortie,but still enjoyable.

The Knasty Knight is one tuff monster.",998524800,,599,5.521739130434782
