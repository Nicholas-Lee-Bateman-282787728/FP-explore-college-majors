8525200,5,B0084UHER0,"This is one of the best ECW commercial tapes from 1997
Born to be Wired should've been ECW's second PPV but, PPV providers were gun shy dealing with ECW after the Mass Transit incident

this is a really enjoyable super card before 1/2 the ECW originals jumped ship to WCW & WWF

1. Little Guido VS Pablo Marquez
2. Mikey Whipwreck vs the Late  Louie Spicolli  (Solid match)
3. Spike Dudley vs the Late  Bam Bam Bigelow (not as good as the insane matches between Spike and Mike Awesome but, enjoyable with a few crazy spots!)
4.  Chris Candido vs Chris Chetti (Candido carries most of this match this is when Chetti had no personality and was being pushed as Taz's nephew)
5. Shane Douglas vs Lance Storm (5 Star match with two guys that work flawless together)
6.  Taz vs Al Snow  Really strong match Snow does most of the heavy lifting once Taz got the tv title he got a bit lazy and was booked like he was legit shoot fighter  (ECW World tv Championship)
7.  Big Dick Dudley & Buh Buh Ray Dudley & D-Von Dudley vs Axl Rotten & Balls Mahoney & Hack Meyers (just a crazy 6-man tag with lots of brawling This is the Dudley Boyz at there most hated
8. Rob Van Dam vs Tommy Dreamer (One of Dreamer's  best non Sandman, Brain Lee or Raven matches) RVD helped make this match so good
9. Sabu vs Terry Funk  ""Barbed Wire""  match  (ECW World Championship)
This might be the closest time ECW came close to a streamlined  FMW  style match
Both Sabu and Funk leave it all in the ring it's brutal you gotta give it to Funk he was up there in age and delivered more in this match then Hulk Hogan did for the years he was in WCW it's a must see hardcore match

This is a must see super show while ECW still was ECW was Vince and WWF behind bankrolling the company by this time more then likely none the less it's a classic show
This is the only way to see this card raw, uncut, and uncensored  9/10",1451952000,,1885,4.174515235457064
8525201,5,B0084UHER0,Waited a long time to see this quality of the footage was awesome,1441152000,,65,4.076923076923077
8525202,2,B0084UHER0,The Little Guido-Pablo Marquez match was your usual fast paced opener but it was a total spot fest with the lack of selling driving fans crazy as usual. The Mikey Whipwreck-Louie Spicolli match was better than the opener because Mikey is a lot better than Guido or Marquez. The Spike Dudley-Bam Bam Bigelow match was mostly a one-sided nightmare with a weird finish to boot. The Chris Candido-Chris Chetti match was another match with no story to it and in this case there was even less of a doubt as to who was going to win given how Joey kept hyping up Taz vs. Candido at the PPV. The Lance Storm-Shane Douglas match was long and boring. The TV title match between Tazz & Al Snow never quite clicked as they were didn't seem quite sure what they were going for as Taz kept switching from wrestling to brawling. MAKE UP YOUR MIND! The Dudley Boys-Axl Rotten/Balls Mahoney-tag team match was a big brawling mess but it was what the fans wanted to see. The six man part only lasted about four minutes but that was what the fans were the most excited for. The Rob Van Dam-Tommy Dreamer match was not great but pretty good. The Barbed Wire match for the Worlds title between Terry Funk & Sabu was a major mess. It was a total freak show and the ending made it even worse as they couldn't even do the right ending because they got stuck. I give this show a 2 out of 10.,1438560000,,1365,4.315175097276264
