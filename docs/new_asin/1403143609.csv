175363,5,1403143609,"This is a great introduction to the basic theories of Scientology. An interview given by L. Ron Hubbard, you get the information straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak.

Rather than listening to the OPINIONS of others about what Scientology is, it's a good idea to listen to the tape and decide for yourself if it makes sense or not.

When I saw this video, it made a lot of sense to me - and clarified questions I had always had about the religion itself.

I highly recommend this.",1108598400,2,488,4.4
175364,5,1403143609,"This video is a must for anyone seriously interested in finding out what Scientology is all about.
In this interview, Hubbard covers the basic beliefs of what we, as human beings and spiritual beings, are; what we are doing here; where we are going.
Hubbard gives some of the more important (yet basic) Scientology teachings, and he covers a number of the misconceptions regarding Scientology. He describes what psychology and psychotherapy are doing, in contrast to what Scientology is. This is very good information for anyone who has heard that Scientology provides counseling, and doesn't understand how it then differs from other types of counseling.
As the only filmed interview that Hubbard ever gave, it is an historically significant piece of work. As an explanation of what Scientology is, its goals and its purposes, it is very valuable.
I highly recommend this to anyone who is curious about Scientology and wants to find out for himself.",1065484800,3,950,5.096153846153846
175365,5,1403143609,"If you've ever wondered about Scientology, what it is and what it does, I suggest you go to the source, the man who started it. In this interview Mr. Hubbard clearly states what the subject is about and why he founded it. I thought he was interesting and I found my head nodding with agreement through much of it, especially when he talks about the state of man and why people might need a philosophy that, according to Hubbard, makes any person using it happier and more intelligent. It's worth watching",1047340800,7,504,4.549450549450549
175366,5,1403143609,this video is the only filmed interview Mr. Hubbard gave. It was very interesting to see and hear his description of the scientology religion. Very easy to understand. It gave me some new viewpoints to man and the mind. For everyone who wants to find out for himself.,1026950400,6,267,4.583333333333333
175367,5,1403143609,"This filmed interview of L. Ron Hubbard was done many years ago in England - I think at his home in East Grinstead.

I found it immensely interesting to watch Mr. Hubbard answer questions.  He was obviously a thoughtful, intelligent, curious and compassionate individual who sincerely wanted to help mankind.

Their discussions covered a fairly wide range of subjects within the field of the mind as approached by Scientology and Dianetics.

You really get the opportunity to see the founder of these subjects in a relaxed environment, being asked the obvious questions.  But, these are the questions we would ask of him ourselves, aren't they?  These are the things we would want to know.

I think this film is a gem, and should be viewed by anyone who ever had a question or two regarding the subjects of Scientology or Dianetics.

Certainly, they should be viewed by anyone wishing to better himself and those around him.  His family.  His community.  His various groups.

Along with this interview, the books, ""The Problems of Work"" and ""The Fundamentals of Work"" would also be excellent purchases.",1273104000,5,1102,4.961748633879782
175368,4,1403143609,"There has been a lot written on the subject of Scientology and everyone seems to have an opinion about it, but this DVD allows one to learn about the subject directly from its founder. You can hear a description of the basic ideas of Scientology in his own words, and get a feel for what Mr. Hubbard was like as a person. In researching any subject, it is vital to obtain information from authoritative sources, and there is no more authoritative source about the subject of Scientology than Mr. Hubbard. I found the DVD to be interesting and insightful, and most importantly, informative about the mind, the spirit, and life itself. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to know more information about Scientology.",1272412800,3,716,4.782258064516129
175369,5,1403143609,"L. Ron Hubbard is such an interesting individual!

There are many films and taped lectures more current, but this one is special as it is an interview and personal.

You know the materials of Scientology comprise the largest written and spoken body of any single philosophic work.  Those materials have further given rise to the only major religion founded in the twentieth century.  Imagine that!

Mr. Hubbard says that in Scientology, ""We are dealing with discoveries"".

Further, ""We are studying the soul or spirit.  We are studying it as itself.""  ""We are not trying to use this study to enhance some other study or belief.  And we are telling the story of how it came about that the soul needed rediscovering.""

If this dvd is available, I recommend you get it.",1271289600,3,766,4.778625954198473
175370,5,1403143609,"I was impressed by this video - mostly because I'm told it was originally shot in black and white and was colorized later - an amazing restoration.  It was also fantastic in that it's the first time I saw L Ron Hubbard in motion, rather than just photographs.  There has been so much mystery around him and who he really was and this gives you a real glimpse into his sincerity, his wit, and his information actually coming from him.  It certainly made the man more real and made me interested in finding out more.",1268092800,7,514,4.389473684210526
175371,5,1403143609,"I think it is worth watching, you get to see Hubbard as he was, and make up your own mind about it!  I thought it was very awesome to hear the answers from ""the horse's mouth"" and it was quite different than you might expect.",1267660800,8,225,4.0
175372,3,1403143609,"I found this interview to be somewhat interesting. The interview was obviously staged. The interviewer, Tony Hitchman acts the part of a journalist, but was actually a Scientologist for several years before this was filmed. No difficult questions are asked, and Hitchman fails to ask some follow-up questions to some of the more strange things Hubbard says. It's a promotional piece for Scientology, but I still found it interesting, not in that it really explains much of anything, but I guess, because it's rare to see Hubbard try to explain Scientology to outsiders, as most or all of his taped lectures were given to Scientologists. If you're interested in Scientology and can find it at a cheap price, it's worth watching if you take it for what it is.",1222214400,3,757,4.875968992248062
175373,5,1403143609,"This is one of the only filmed interviews LRH did, and it is very insightful on the introductory believes and axioms of the Scientology religion.

But mostly this film allows you to see him, how he moves, his mannerisms, and hear about Scientology FROM SOURCE !!",1218499200,5,262,4.695652173913044
175374,5,1403143609,"This is an incredible DVD.

One thing that deserves comment is how well the digital restoration was done.  From what I understand, this digital restoration set the industry standard.

Secondly, you get to hear about Scientology from the source of Scientology himself - L. Ron Hubbard.  This lets you make up your own mind.  In an hour's time you're left with a firm idea of what Scientology is and also some knowledge that you can use in your own life.",1210032000,6,452,4.6
175375,1,1403143609,"I have no idea why the church of scientology doesn't pull this embarrassing garbage off the shelves.

I wanted to watch the dvd to see what scientology is all about and was interested to see how charismatic l ron hubbard was to have founded it.

What a rambling, bumbling BORE! His writings or advisors must be more coherent and mesmerizing! I cannot remember the last time I was subjected to such contradictory and aimless chatter!

""The insane are.....the insane."" and ""The brain is.....the brain."" are two examples of the absence of fluidity or thought that tortured one attempting to endure this interview. I laughed out loud at the parts that did not lull me to sleep.

The interviewer must be a member of Scientology or someone who was very kind to snatch out of the air a coherent summary from l ron hubbard's nonsensical and directionless statements.

If I hear him say ""and so on and so forth "" one more time as his voice fades and trails off once again depriving us from a simple articulate and organized thought or statement, I'll become one of the insane that he seems to repeatedly distance himself.

It was interesting that he mentions undesirables that are not welcome to scientology. What authentic and desirable religion excludes one from becoming a follower?

This dvd certainly makes the founder of scientology look bumbling in his awkward attempts towards impressive or didactic posturing.

His 'no/yes' reply to the simple question of is scientology a religion should be interesting to anyone examining scientology's tax-exempt status.

This dvd is a gold mine to anyone looking for faults in scientology and its founder and a humilation to any member of this new religion founded a little over fifty years ago.",1201996800,4,1732,4.904109589041096

7795512,5,1403143609,"Five stars for being a shining example of pro-scientology propaganda of an earlier era. Kind of an ""infomercial"" for scientology and Hubbard himself. It's a set up ""interview"" between Hubbard and some English guy. The highlight is when Hubbard gets up and thoughtfully answers questions while posing and walking around the room. Nice little video if you collect this kind of stuff. I find this kind of thing very interesting.",1385078400,,425,5.085714285714285
7795513,1,1403143609,"This spectacular DVD features LRH speaking, first hand, on the subject of Scientology. I would like to first start by saying that I believe Scientology is the ONLY way to happiness. That being said I was upset to see and hear LRH say so many contradictory things. He does give a wonderful definition of what Scientology means. I was also frankly shocked to see that LRH appeared to have dental problems (I myself I have completed Church rundowns related to good dental health). I watched this DVD probably 15 times. I have since loaned it to my mother who unfortunately has been anti Scientology, hopefully this will change her mind!",1366848000,,633,4.763636363636364

7795515,3,1403143609,"By watching the DVD, I couldn't help but notice that L.Ron Hubbard, the founder of scientology, just goes in circles and is vague about his religion. In the DVD which is restored in color, he is being interviewed by a British journalist Tony Hitchman. Perhaps it's all staged anyway but I could never understand scientology and I still don't.

L. Ron Hubbard comes across as strange more of a creative writer than thinker but he has founded a religion not based on dogma but new aged techniques. This DVD may have scientology as harmless religion rather than a cult. He is being interviewed by some unknown newsman and the appearance seemed rather staged overall. He is sitting at the desk most of the time and explaining scientology but it's never clear. He never really answers the questions nor are any accusations or allegations of misuse or abuse of the religion explained in the DVD.

Anyway, I found the DVD quite by accident where it was unwrapped and never seen. The DVD comes with a booklet inside about scientology. L. Ron Hubbard may have died in 1986 but his legacy is his scientology religion has grown to popular status. In his day, scientology may have been about a revolution of those unhappy with their own religious upbringing. To this day, scientology is rather still vague and even more secretive than originally thought.",1349049600,2,1342,4.805194805194805
7795516,3,1403143609,"I saw this Video a couple of times, and it sparked a little interest for me. As it gives insight into Hubbard's way of thinking, it was useful for exploring Scientologist thinking. However, it did appear staged, as the interviewer asked no follow-up questions, and at the very beginning, it states that this is Hubbard's only filmed interview, when I have seen evidence to the contrary.

I would recommend this to someone who wants to perhaps gain some insight into Hubbard's way of thinking, but it is definately not a spectacular source of information in my opinion.",1290729600,2,568,4.855670103092783
7795517,5,1403143609,"I saw this interview many years ago on film when it was in black and white.  Someone has done a tremendous job of colorizing this and presenting it on DVD.  Also the dialogue is much clearer and easier to understand.

I have since gone on and heard many of Mr. Hubbard's lectures on the subjects of Dianetics and Scientology.  These, for the most part, are audio lectures, though there is a series called ""The Clearing Congress"", again colorized and restored and available on DVD.  These other lectures are more specific to the subject and its parts.

But this talk is perhaps the most general overview of the subject you will get from L Ron Hubbard himself.  It certainly prompted me to want to know more about the subject and, of course, I did.

Highly recommended for someone who knows little or nothing about Scientology.",1274140800,2,825,4.680555555555555
