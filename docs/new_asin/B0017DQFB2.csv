3171503,1,B0017DQFB2,"The box claims the name of the main character is Steven. In the movie his name is Fred Hill.(Canadian film give-away.) The movie starts off with Fred or Steven (LDP) coming to, after being hung upside down by his foot in a tree. He has blood on his head and a knife falls from his belt. The rope breaks and LDP is on the ground with a bum knee and no memory on how he got where he was, who did this to him, or if they are still around. So what does he do? He shouts for help. Then when he hears someone coming in his direction (apparently the reason why he was shouting) he takes off running in the opposite direction. The man, Andy, who catches up with him has a gun, and LDP has no memory.  They walk through the woods, with LDP being bullied at gun point, looking for the two story ""cabin"" with LDP getting bits and pieces of his memory back as they stroll along. His memory is confusing as sometimes he sees himself, then sometimes he sees Andy doing the exact same thing. Most of the film is taken up by the stroll in the woods with flashbacks. When they finally get to the cabin, you can't wait for the movie to end. By that point I really couldn't care who did what. No nudity. No sex. Not much plot. Bad language. Unless you are related to LDP, there is no reason to watch this film.",1288915200,3,1291,4.102766798418973
3171504,2,B0017DQFB2,"I like Lou Diamond Phillips, but this dvd was very disappointing.  The story needed to be better developed and the flash backs were disconcerting.  I don't recommend this one.",1285891200,,175,5.0
3171505,4,B0017DQFB2,"Head trauma and psychic shock can produce a loss of memory...
So we have Andy with a hand gun and Frank with a knife
taking a long hike ( lost ) in the woods.
Somebody isn't dealing from a full deck?
Some very good acting and a slow turn in the wind
makes this a pretty good movie.
Th end twist sort of sneaks up on you, like Frank's memory.",1221091200,6,341,3.8857142857142857
3171506,1,B0017DQFB2,"I have nothing against LDP and enjoyed many of his movies in the past, including the book series movie he starred in about a Navajo deputy, the great Adam Beach did the rest. However, this movie just drug on and on seemingly  like a cartoon is made with the same scenes just altered a little bit. The dialog was like Ground Hog Day. Over and over, the same words, If it was a 1/2 hour short it might have worked but it was way too long, like this review was.",1214438400,2,458,4.088888888888889
3171507,5,B0017DQFB2,"I really wish this film had better distribution. It's one of those movies where most of the way through it your wondering what's going on. It's not a perfect movie by any means however it's good enough that it warrants some respect, a second viewing and maybe a place in any respectable film collection. Yes it's low budget(not always a bad thing) and some of the dialouge seems a bit forced, but somehow it's a charming little thriller. Check it out.",1213488000,5,451,4.580246913580247

8265760,3,B0017DQFB2,Lou Diamond always one of my favorites just something about him playing the bad guy it was a bit of a turn off. But it is a fairly good movie.,1491264000,,142,3.7666666666666666

8265767,3,B0017DQFB2,"Honestly, I don't know what to make of this movie. It started off promising but (if you haven't seen it and don't want a SPOILER, stop reading)........the ending left me confused as to what exactly was going on. The only thing that I know for certain is that people died. I'm totally confused as to whether or not LDP's character had multiple personalities (which I'm leaning towards) or if there really were two guys. Honestly, I don't want to have to sit through this movie again to try to see if I missed something the first time around. Like I said, it started off with such promise to be a good thriller then just fell flat and left me shaking my head.",1421971200,,657,4.39344262295082
8265768,3,B0017DQFB2,"I purchased this movie because I am on a quest to watch everything Kris Holden-Ried has acted in. First time I watched it I didn't like the film, it was very confusing and too much woods. When you watch the movie you will know what I mean. If you do not like puzzling suspense movies don't bother with this one. It will keep you guessing to the end. I do like a movie that I can't figure out right away but this one bored me in spots because the drew it out too long. Could have reduced to an hour and had a better film.",1346889600,,520,3.961904761904762
