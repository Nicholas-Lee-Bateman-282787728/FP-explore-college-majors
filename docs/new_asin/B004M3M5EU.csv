8435471,5,B004M3M5EU,"I watched this many times on Twin Cities Public Television, was no longer available for purchase through PBS, and I was delighted to find it still available on Amazon.  This is strictly for those of faith, regardless of what that faith might be.  It follows a group of Twin Cities clergy (yes, a priest, a rabbi and an imam, as well as representatives of most Protestant denominations) who are loving and supportive friends despite religious differences, who travel to The Holy Land to gain a deeper understanding of their own and each others' faiths.  It does not sugar coat the differences in beliefs, nor gloss over the very real fears and hatreds that exist between the Israelis and Palestinians.  It is, however, very uplifting when you see how one-on-one relationships based on respect, understanding and love can bridge the chasms between the three great monotheistic religions and gives hope that people of different ethnicities and religions might someday live in peace.  A lesson for all people of faith.",1378598400,3,1014,5.011904761904762
