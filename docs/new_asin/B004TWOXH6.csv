4466055,2,B004TWOXH6,"This Puccini opera is actually one of my favorites.  However I rented this one for view on my Panasonic Viera TV, which is where I watch all the movies that I buy or rent from Amazon.  The peformance was in Italian, which is to be expected,however I was very disappointed that there were no english subtitles so my family lost interest because they did not understand it. It was not noted that there were no subtitles and that this video was not in english before I rented it. I wasted my money.",1372464000,8,495,4.369565217391305

4466057,5,B004TWOXH6,"This is a magnificent production.  Amazon's description indicates Harold Prince as an actor, which, of course, is wrong.  Harold Prince has directed many Broadway musicals and he did a brilliant job on this opera.  It's the small touches that make a difference.  During the duet between Turandot and Calaf, usually you see the tenor aggressively kissing her by planting a big smackeroo on her face.  What Prince did here is absolutely right and it was as if a light went on in my head.  The kiss is sweet and not aggressive and that is the way it should be since Turandot believes all men are rapists and murderers at heart.
The stars are Jose Carreras and Eva Marton and they are both wonderful.  It's nice to see any Calaf with a beautiful voice, but for him to be able to act is an added bonus.  The scenery and costumes are maybe a little over the top, but what the heck, it's a fairy tale and who wouldn't want to imagine a place like that?
Highly recommended.",1448841600,2,965,4.443181818181818

4466062,5,B004TWOXH6,"I saw this production in Vienna and it was stunning, and LOUD (the woman next to me kept covering her ears).  I think it has the longest staircase EVER to be used on a stage.

4466064,4,B004TWOXH6,"Marton is wonderful. Carreras is very good. Ricciarelli is ok. The chorus and orchestra are very good. The costumes are fine. But the minimalist sets are dreadful. I dislike minimalist sets in any opera, but in Turandot, they are completely out of place. It should be the ancient city of Peking in all of it's splendor. Instead it is a bare staircase from a boiler factory. I recommend the Metropolitan Opera dvd, with Marton, Domingo, and Leona Mitchell. It has great singing and playing, great costumes, and wonderful, sumptuous sets.",1376006400,5,536,4.966666666666667
4466065,5,B004TWOXH6,"This strikingly-staged production of Puccini's final opera, ""Turandot"" was filmed with the Vienna State Opera under the direction of Loren Maazal in 1983.  Set on a spare stage with a single ascending staircase rising up to Turandot's chambers, and with sumptuous, impressionistic costuming, the production allows the audience to focus not on the sets or lighting, but the performances, which are uniformly excellent, and lend the production a stark, other-worldly feeling.  Carreras is near his prime here, commanding and sure on his arias, while Katia Ricciarelli is radiant as Liu.  Eva Marton is pure and powerful as the title princess, giving a weighty sense of grief to her character's fate.  This DVD is worth watching just for their performances alone (and you can find a low-quality VHS transfer of this production on YouTube for preview).  As the previous reviewer noted, there are no subtitles for the production, but this is typical of older productions - it's simplicity itself to print out your own libretto and follow alone if you don't know the story.  Also, the filming and sound is not going to match current production values; but that said, this is still a stellar cast, with glorious performances and lush, potent direction by Maazal.",1374710400,8,1255,5.127450980392157

8440985,3,B004TWOXH6,"This review is for the Marton/Sylvester/Runnicles performance with the San Francisco Opera.

Turandot is my second-favorite opera (after Tchaikovsky's Pique Dame), and I bought this one largely because of the David Hockney design, even though I knew it likely would not top other performances I've seen. While it indeed did not, it was still enjoyable. The video and audio were not up to modern standards, but the costumes were intriguing and the sets well-thought out and well-utilized on such a small stage. There were some great visuals, and the colorful scenes were half the fun. At one point when everyone was walking zig-zag up the steps in alternating patterns, I was quite impressed.

I guess my biggest disappointment was the orchestra/conducting. The music just didn't pack the same punch as the performances I have on CD conducted by Mehta and Karajan (granted these are studio recordings, but they are what I'm used to hearing). The music often lacked majesty and drama, which this score leaves plenty of opportunity for. Again, the technology used here may be partly to blame, but it was also a fault of the conductor with tempos that were too fast or notes/phrases that weren't milked for their dramatic potential. The singing was good all around if not fantastic. Sylvester is no Pavarotti (who is?), but he is fairly strong-voiced and did a fine job. He appeared confident and engaged, and I thought Liu was also very good, especially in her death scene aria. Eva Marton as Turandot did a nice acting job, especially with her transformation from icy to thawed. Some Turandots never get past the icy. She actually looked like she was crying at one point.

I have to say it was a real treat to hear the enthusiasm of the San Francisco audience. They clearly loved this performance and showed it. And these are some of the most fun, appreciative curtain calls I've ever seen, with everyone getting (and most everyone catching!) flower bouquets. Eva Marton (Turandot) catches one in each hand, and the audience loves it, and Ping, Pang and Pong catch all of theirs. Somebody is a really good thrower!

I would not hesitate to recommend this to lovers of this opera. The Metropolitan Opera performances of it are more resplendent and technically superior (one of these also stars Marton), but this one is a fine addition to any collection. If the technology were better I'd probably have enjoyed it more and given it a fourth star.",1520380800,,2442,4.87710843373494

This Turandot is great in many ways. Great stage design a  new end, not so different form the othe two.

The singing is great, specially Calaf, great and Powerful voice and sung a beatifull Nessun Dorma. Turandot also has not a specially beautiful voice but sings great a very fifficult role as this wiithout any problem in the high notes in In questa reggia and durig the rest of the opera. We can notice that China has very good singers.

The rest of threcast is very good, but for me the best are the principal couple Calaf and Turandot. Buy it and you will not regret. Hopefuly we can hva it sooon in BLURAY.",1484352000,,864,4.38125
8440990,5,B004TWOXH6,"5.0 out of 5 starsWonderful lavish production, Excellent editing, Super Calaf
ByArchie (Ottawa Canada)on January 14, 2017
Format: DVD|Verified Purchase
This is a 2013 production from the China National Centre for the Performing Arts. From the bits visible on the Bonus addition, it is architecturally speaking a spectacular building. I woud have liked more about it. This production is equally spectacular. But I wonder if the physical audience would get as much out of the production as DVD viewers would. They would certaiinly appreciate the lavish spectacle, but the more subtle interpersonal interplay, which is well captued on camera, would be lost due to the distane from the stage. The editing for DVD does a fine job of showing both the spectacle and the facial expressions. My only complaint about the recording is that the orchestra is not quite as clear as I would like -- but that is small quibble.

The cast is all Chinese, and have performed primarily at the NCPA. But that is not to take away their abilities. Dai Yuqiang is arguably the best Calaf I have ever seen. With his singing and acting and looks, he presents a character with enormous charisma. I would say much the same about Yao Hong who plays Liu -- she comes across as so young and vulnerable that I am sure she is what Puccini had in mind when writing the death scene -- and it was the death of him as well.. I have heard marginally better sung performances, but the total package here is unbeatable. Sun Xiuwei does extremely well as Tuandot. I would have liked a bit less vibrato, but having heard so many other sopranos with equally wide vibrato, I suppose it goes with the demands of the role. Chen Xinyi's direction of the huge cast of singers and dancers without sacrificing the nuances of the interplay of the main characters was very successful. And as I wrote above the DVD editing enhanced it all.

I am not a musicologist, so I have difficulty writing about the new ending composed by Hao Weiya. On the one hand, I was glad to have more music in the extended ending, but I think providing a psychological explanation of why Turandot ultimately fell for Calaf was not necessary. From my point of view, just as Calaf had a coup de foudre and fell for Turandot at first sight, so after a bit of softening up, Calaf giving her his name should have been enough for her. Some unkind critic called this ending ""Disneyfied"". However, most productions of Turandot are lavish, so why not this? It is most enjoyable.

In short this a poduction that is more than well worth while experiencing.",1484352000,,2571,4.671081677704194
8440991,5,B004TWOXH6,"This is a NCPA (China National Center of Performing Arts) production where the whole cast, orchestra (except the conductor), and staging are Chinese. It is an impressive and lavish production, very effective. The spectacular and grandiose scenes are very well done and bring you to the point of wow, without taking away from the music and essence of this well-known opera.
The cast is very good, musically and dramatically. It is not an easy opera to sing, but everyone does a very good job. Liu, the typical Puccini suffering woman, casted by Yao Hong, is remarkable and the staging of her demise is incredibly effective, even beautiful. The voices of Ping, Pang, and Pong are so similar that it sounds more like a choir of 3 than an ensemble of 3 voices.  The Ping, Pang, and Pong scene in the second act, an amazing introspective scene with marvelous music, lacks distinction among the three voices.
Composer Hao Weiya composed a new finale for this opera. As a reminder, Puccini died before finishing this opera; he only completed the work up to the scene where Liu dies.  A few composers have undertaken crafting an ending to the opera, some of them more famous than others.  Weiyas take on the task here is a balanced ending, although it seems to me that the point where Turandots ice character is broken and she openly falls in love with Calaf lacks enough climax, while the climax is given to a pompous finale with full choir and orchestra playing fortissimo.  It is, obviously, a matter of taste and opinion, but I would have liked to see Turandots transformation in the most potent way possible.
The recording, visual and audio, is excellent and it really brings you into the amazing theater in Beijing. In summary, a recording to have and keep.",1483660800,3,1755,4.744262295081967
8440992,5,B004TWOXH6,"Turandot is my favorite opera.  I've seen it performed by many artists including the other two great tenors, Pavarotti and Placido Domingo.  This production however is the best.  Eva Marton is perfection and Jose Carreras is right up there with the best.  He was in perfect voice at this time, having just come back from a cancer scare.  If you can have only one Turandot in your collection, this should be on your shelf.",1472774400,,421,4.635135135135135
