513141,5,6302798515,"This enjoyable comedy has always been one of my favorite Mae West  pictures although it does not enjoy the fame or reputation of I'M NO ANGEL or SHE DONE HIM WRONG or even MY LITTLE CHICKADEE.  The movie was based on a naughty hit play called PERSONAL APPEARANCE that starred Gladys George as a blonde movie queen with multiple men who finds herself stranded among her fans in the middle of the country.  Sounds like a terrific springboard for a Mae West picture but the movie was made after the censor boards clamped down and cut nearly all of the racy dialogue which may well have been Mae Westisms in the first place!! Yet the movie has a lot to offer fans of classic movies, especially for it's glimpse into how movie-mad the American public was in the 1930's.  Mae is delightful and her seduction of Randolph Scott is one of her more potent cinema encounters.  The film also gives lie to the legend of West being so jealous of other women she never let other actresses shine in her films - the picture is loaded with excellent character actresses who have many scenes with Ms. West and Elizabeth Patterson even has some wonderful lines in scenes with La Mae and a delicious barb at Mae's expense: ""In my day, women with hair that color didn't go out in the daytime!""  Mae West even shares many scenes with another blonde - delightfully dingy little Isabel Jewell who at one point even does an impression of Mae's Paramount rival Marlene Dietrich in a scene with Mae talking about how much she loves movies!  Mae even is unafraid to appear unsympathetic, at times acting quite bossy and self-centered as a spoiled movie diva.  This is a really enjoyable if unusually conventional 1930's comedy film for a Mae West picture which is all the more reason it may find a greater audience than many Mae West romps.",1050624000,6,1811,4.567901234567901
513142,2,6302798515,"That's because this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the west--it's set in PA. Except that there's some talk that big movie actress Mae West will take local rube grease monkey Randolph Scott back to Hollywood with her. Or--duh--maybe it's a play on her last name? Down to basics: Mae is this big movie star whose contract stipulates that she cannot marry for the next five yearrs. Her public relations man Warren William is there to make the contract stick, and so promptly dispatches any guy he thinks Mae will look twice at. Car trouble lands the two in a Pennsylvanian hick town filled with her hayseed fans, further complications when Mae takes a shine to local yokel Randy Scott. That's about it. Takes too long to get to the much better and rather satisfying wrap-up.  Be that as it mae, Ms. West is always fun to watch with all her purring and undulations. Warren William is the comic relief this time round (oh, he's so much better as a scoundrel, as in ""Skyscraper Souls"" or ""Employees' Entrance""--what a waste of talent); here he shows a little of that whatever it  was that was so disturbing in great quantity in the gadawful ""Satan Met a Lady"".  ""Go West, Young Man"" was okay for one viewing, but I don't advise a revisitation.",996796800,8,1246,4.603603603603603
513143,3,6302798515,"After the failure of ""Klondike Annie,"" Mae West tried something different: an adaptation of someone else's material. ""Personal Appearance"" was a stage play about a big star stuck in a small town,  and in the early scenes of the film, she is fairly funny as she plays the  star as vain, ignorant, and self-obsessed. This brief bit of satire is  promising, but the film soon becomes the usual West vehicle, with various  slickers and studs after the irresistable heroine. This is the rare West  film with a strong supporting cast, and it passes fairly pleasantly, but  the censors were at their strongest -- and Mae without double entendres  isn't really Mae.",964137600,3,657,4.864864864864865
513144,3,6302798515,"Zestfully tedious. Mae plays a movie star whose car breaks down in a hick town. She's invited to stay at the home of a young blond farmer in the form of Randolph Scott... One would expect Mae's impact on the unsophisticated folk she encounters - plus her allurement of the handsome young farmer - to be pretty darned amusing. Not so. Under the Legion of Decency's scrutiny, the star had become more statuesque and less outrageous and the pace of the play - on which the film was based - slowed down as Mae struck her glamourous signiture poses which were always kept front and centre by director Henry Hathaway. Based upon the successful broadway comedy PERSONAL APPEARANCE which starred Gladys George as Mavis, this rather toned-down version is an adequate yet unexciting vehicle for star West. Born August 17, 1893 in Brooklyn, Mae's dad was a small-time prizefighter named Jack West while her mother Mathilda was supposedly a great beauty in her day: a Lillian Russell type. While Mae was by no means a beauty, the amazing Hollywood expert beauty technicians made West look much more attractive than she was in the twenties: one can hardly believe she's the same person when photographs from the two decades are compared!",958953600,,1224,4.833333333333333

7831347,3,6302798515,"""Go West Young Man"" is a tame West vehicle. It has some charm and some laughs but it never reaches the comedic heights of her earlier, much bawdier films. Although West was battling the censors for most of her artistic life, by 1936, they were successful in watering down her material so do not expect a lot of her witty and sexually laced dialogue. There is very little of it here.

West plays Mavis Arden, a temperamental movie star who is constantly being scrutinized by her press agent, Morgan (Warren Williams). Morgan is secretly in love with her and tries to sabotage all of her dates and personal appearances with the male population. During one of these personal appearance tours, her car breaks down and she is forced to take refuge in a boarding house populated by several colorful characters, including a star-struck girl (Isabel Jewell) and a strapping mechanic (Randolph Scott) whom Arden becomes smitten with.

In comparison to her other star vehicles, this one is rather lack-luster and it's not solely due to the watered down treatment of her dialogue. The film is rather weak, and if there is a West feature that has a running time that feels endless, it's this one. There is not much action here and West plays a rather shallow, unlikable character and despite moments of redemption, you end up caring for no one and even the secondary characters come across as a bit annoying. ""Go West, Young Man"" is still good to watch at least once as there is no accounting for taste, and the film has it's highlights but for me, this is mediocre West. She has done and will do better.

7831348,5,6302798515,"This was the first Mae West movie I had seen. She was quite the rave back in the thirties, but I knew very little about her and had seen none of her films. This one was cheap so I decided to buy it, not expecting too much of it quite honestly. It turns out that this is a very good movie with a plot and story that seems to be tailor-made for Miss West. It is not one of her better-known works (I'm No Angel, My Little Chickadee) but it is a good one nonetheless. This is a perfect Mae West movie. Love it!

7831349,4,6302798515,"Go West Young Man may not be Mae Wests best picture ever but it did entertain me and I was genuinely curious to see how the plot would turn out at the end. There are a few interesting plot twists throughout the film that work to enhance it and the acting by all is better than I expected based on reading the mixed reviews before I actually watched the film. Moreover, the choreography and cinematography both shine and I like the use of lighting in many scenes to help set the mood and the tone of scenes.

When the action all starts (and theres plenty of it) we quickly meet glamorous Hollywood actress Mavis Arden (Mae West) who loves her men but has a stipulation in her movie studio contract that she cannot marry for five yearsand theres her public relations man Morgan (Warren William) to make sure that the men Mavis sees won't interest or tempt her at all! However, Mavis is no dope and shes constantly getting around Morgan, meeting men and in particular she enjoys a tryst with politician Francis X. Harrigan (Lyle Talbot in a role played to perfection).

Mavis current tour (before she returns to Hollywood) is to end in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania but before she, Morgan and her small entourage can even get there, her fancy car breaks down by the side of the road and they all wind up in Mrs. Struthers (Alice Brady) rather plain boarding house (The Haven) which has Mrs. Struthers; Mrs. Struthers daughter Joyce (Margaret Perry); Gladys (Isabel Jewell); the very old-fashioned and stuffy Aunt Kate Barnaby (Elizabeth Patterson) and Professor Herbert Rigby (Etienne Girardot) all living and/or working there. Theres also the most handsome Bud Norton (Randolph Scott) who helps Mrs. Struthers out in his own way by having a small time business auto gas and fix-it station in front of Mrs. Struthers home and Bud has both Clyde (Maynard Holmes) and Nick Stewart in a very embarrassingly dated role as Nicodemus, a young African-American who isn't exactly too bright.

Right away Morgan can tell Mavis has her eyes on a possible new conquestthis time, Bud himself; and Morgan tries to send Bud on an errand to Washington to get Bud out of the picture (both literally and figuratively!) but that doesnt work outthen Morgan has to figure out a way to keep Mavis and Bud apart while Joyce is terribly wounded that her beau Bud appears to be taking a romantic interest, slowly but surely, to Mavis who is actively trying to seduce him.

Of course theres more to the story than thisIve already left out some of the plot and I won't write much more for fear of spoiling it all for you! Suffice it to say that the film, again while not Mae Wests best one ever, does have the interesting plot twists I mentioned above that held my attention and theres a really unexpected plot twist at the very end of the film!

Look also for solid performances by Alyce Ardell as Jeanette, Mavis French maid; John Indrisano as Mavis chauffeur; Charles Irwin in a small role as a Master of Ceremonies and Xavier Cugat along with his Orchestra in a clip from the film within the film entitled Drifting Lady.

Overall, I recommend Go West Young Man for fans of Mae West and the other principal actors in it. In addition, people who enjoy comedies with some romance thrown in for a good effect will not be disappointed.",1394841600,,3300,4.642123287671233
7831350,5,6302798515,"Mae was very funny with her quips in this film. Unable to use as much double entendres as usual due to the censors,she nonetheless used lots of her personality to sell the story of an actress on a man hunt. Mae West will NEVER be forgotten.",1361145600,,240,4.239130434782608
7831351,2,6302798515,"Mae West was so displeased with this bland adaptation of the Broadway hit ""Personal Appearance"" that she mentioned it only once in her autobiography. Thanks to Hays Office censorship, ""Go West, Young Man"" (1936) lacked the comic spark of Mae's earlier films, with few classic one-liners and a tamed West stuck in Pennsylvania. Co-star Randolph Scott and director Henry Hathaway fared better in their Zane Grey collaborations. The weakest of Mae's Paramount vehicles.",1241827200,2,466,5.397260273972603
7831352,4,6302798515,"Marvis Arden (Mae West) is a sensational movie star. Her following spans the world and her personal appearance tours prove her popularity. On her way home from one such appearance, Arden's car breaks down. She orders her publicity man (Warren William) to find her a place to stay, suspicious that he planned the break down to keep her away from a man. However, she soon finds herself mooning over an attractive repairman in town (Randolph Scott) and listening to his ideas about inventing equipment for film.

West is wonderful as always in this breezy and enjoyable movie. She has many snappy quips, especially brilliant since she wrote the script herself. It is always exciting to see Hollywood parodying itself and its stars. The visual elements are quite good, especially the opener. The story is somewhat typical of West because she is out seducing men, but it is unusual because it involves typical country folk. Great fun!",1172448000,,929,4.955128205128205
7831353,4,6302798515,"Mae West wrote ""Go West, Young Man"" based on the play ""Personal Appearances"" by Lawrence Riley. The change in title is a mystery to me, since ""Personal Appearances"" is short and sweet with a nice double meaning, and ""Go West, Young Man"" is only remotely related to the film's plot. Mae West plays haughty movie star Mavis Arden, ""reigning queen of the cinema"". Mavis' contract states that she cannot marry for 5 years, so her press agent Mr. Morgan (Warren William) is constantly maneuvering to keep his star single and scandal-free, impeding her potential romances in any way he can. While on a publicity tour, Mavis' car breaks down in rural Pennsylvania. Morgan arranges for rooms at a nearby boarding house while the auto is repaired. Miss Arden finds that she has many avid fans in the country, including an earnest mechanic, Bud Norton (Randolph Scott), who has invented a new sound technology for motion pictures.

Mae West embodies her stage and screen persona in ""Go West, Young Man"", as in all of her films. But the character of Mavis Arden is distinct from most of her other roles in that she is not likeable. Mavis thinks nothing of busting up Bud's good relationship with his girlfriend. And she looks down her nose at the customs of common people. This is odd, since Mae West's characters are typically of low birth themselves. They are self-absorbed, but they are not cultural snobs. Mavis Arden is, even though it is implied that her ancestry is not exactly patrician. Granted, Mae West's films were made to entertain, not to be analyzed. But I was struck by the lack of sympathy generated by this character. Elizabeth Patterson deserves a mention for her role as ""Aunt Kate"" Barnaby, a down-to-earth spinster who works at the boarding house. Warren William gives Mr. Morgan a certain punchiness that endears him to the audience even though he is at odds with the heroine.  Not one of Mae West's best efforts, but it's entertaining.",1146528000,,1948,4.811940298507463
