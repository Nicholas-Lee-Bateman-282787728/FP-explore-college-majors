However, Blake has acquired all the bad vocal mannerisms of certain Italian tenors, and his voice does not have the pristine purity of years ago.  The music itself is the best Donizetti you can ever listen to.",1404345600,,381,4.5588235294117645
8155784,5,B000KEG8OS,"Rockwell Blake is older here than in his other dvd appearances, but his arias are no less amazing. He sings those oh so difficult notes like he's eating grapes, the divine fruit of the gods!",1381622400,,190,4.457142857142857
8155785,3,B000KEG8OS,"Donizetti a crit une trentaine d'opras. L'air du tnor, dans Marin Faliero, est redoutable. Il vient d'tre enregistr par le nouveau phnomne lyrique Juan Diego Florez. L'intrigue de cet opra est indigeste, mais les chanteurs ont de bons moments et la distribution est remarquable. Dommage que la qualit de l'image (trop sombre) ne soit pas  la hauteur de la performance.",1191974400,6,368,5.133333333333334
8155786,5,B000KEG8OS,"this is the best marin faliero that i could find in the world, a very nice opera of donizetti's paris period.
the cast, the director, all is very great, and the very very difficult tenor's arias of legendary Rubini italian tenor are performed from the best tenor of ever: Rockwell Blake, the best bel canto tenor of the last 50 years! in 'di mia patria, bel soggiorno' he sings a 're bemolle'!!! thank you very much Rocky!

8155787,5,B000KEG8OS,"Marin Faliero is different from most Donizetti operas I've heard. The structure is more complex and the music more dramatic. This could be his Simon Boccanegra or Don Carlo though the music is still distinctive Donizetti. Because of the complexity, the dvd format works very well and allows you to enjoy the production and understand the opera (I LOVE subtitles). The sound is a bit boxy but the dvd offers a few digital alternatives which I trust improve results but are useless for me at the moment. Sets are dark but both sound and picture are an improvement to the private dvds that were circulating.

Marin Faliero is a bass and I could name a couple of current basses who've got a more sumptuous sound than Pertusi but he sings very well while his imposing height is perfect for the nobility of the Doge. His passion is less evident but the moments he needs to show it are fewer too. Servile is in the same league and offers good singing without a very individual sound, the 'cloudy' baritone voice one often gets nowadays. This is a matter of personal taste however, some people may find him more interesting and since he sings well, he's certainly not a liability.

Rockwell Blake is one of the most impressive bel canto tenors of recent times. I can think of no other tenor who could do the trills, runs and arpeggios Blake attempts. On the other hand his constant use of head voice on the top notes (historically valid for bel canto tenors) and the facial expressions that come with it are an acquired taste I've always struggled...to acquire. Having said that, he grows on me here and to have a tenor who can compete with Devia's florid skills is a rarity. Plus he gets points for having a great Italian accent. On stage he's also interesting and passionate which creates good tension, especially in duets.

What can I say for a soprano, who at 54 sings THIS well without any strains or wobbles? To start with, this sounds like a difficult role that requires dramatic coloratura skills similar to Giselda or Odabella plus her only solo scene includes three arias the one after the other. Devia nails that scene with spot on vocal jumps, cries and hot-blooded phrasing but I enjoyed her even more in the duets where her interaction with the others is electrifying. The duet with Blake is a highlight as is the finale of the opera with Pertusi. I jumped up from my seat when she got all worked up in the duet with Blake and unleashed that high note so appropriately when Elena dismisses Fernando and I was in tears moments after that when she floated pianissimo notes for the books.

All in all, I enjoyed this performance immensely and was impressed by the impact of this opera. I don't know much about maestro Dantone but he seemed tuned in with his singers so no problems. Now Hardy should release the 1993 Mose in Egitto with a similar cast that's ready for dvding. Instead of getting one more Elisir for your collection, try this Donizetti rarity.",1168473600,51,2961,4.612903225806452
