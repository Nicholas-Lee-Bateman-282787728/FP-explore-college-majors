7905862,2,B00000DC9H,"The Red House, 1947 film

The film begins with a view of the forests that once covered the land. Pete Morgan's farm is isolated from the other farms. A school bus takes children to school. Pete has a wooden leg, and will hire Meg's friend for help around the farm. Nate learns about the family history; Meg was adopted after her parents moved away. ""Don't take a short cut through the Oxhead woods!"" Avoid the Red House. The wind howls to provide an eerie sense. Or is it screams? The conversations provide the background to this story. Nate falls into the creek on the return home. Was it a human? Nate and Meg walk through the woods in the daylight. Pete orders Meg to stay out of the Oxhead woods. Pete doesn't want anyone trespassing in those woods!

One day Meg sneaks out of her room to walk into the forbidden woods. She sees the Red House! Will she hear rifle shots? Why doesn't she return home? They call the doctor for Meg. Nate talks to her. Pete fires Nate and orders him off his land. Ellen reproaches Pete, and we learn the secret! Tibby has feelings for Teller. What is happening to Pete? Is the Red House haunting them? Ellen goes into the woods at night. Will she be safe? Pete tells what happened years ago. The police catch Teller. Pete drives to the Red House with Meg. Nate and the police arrive to rescue her. Pete drives into the building for the final scene.

This slow paced film reminds me of a Val Lewton film. Its not scary and its not quite credible as a crime story. Would the sudden disappearance of a married couple go unnoticed? Friends or relatives would have asked questions. Who inherited their property [motive]? The real danger in those woods would be moonshiners or poachers, they don't like snoopers.",1446076800,,1740,4.5
7905863,4,B00000DC9H,I saw this film on cable a couple years ago while flipping channels.  Initially the title attracted me but as I began to follow the movie I was drawn in by the strong characters and creepy nature of the story.  This is  a great creepy classic that will both raise the hair on the back of your  neck as well as keep you guessing about the ending.  I reccomend this movie  to anyone that can bear to watch black and white films.,960336000,4,426,4.134146341463414
