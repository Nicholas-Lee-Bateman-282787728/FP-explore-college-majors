8471139,2,B000FTCGBM,This was the frist Grapplers Quest dvd I have ever bought and watched. I really love the UFC and the ground game so I would give it a try. It was ok. Not great at all. It takes place it what I can only assume is a high school gym. There is about 4 maybe 5 fights that have Matt Hughes in them. All in all it's not bad but I wouldn't buy it again. I would try to rent it from somewhere if I could find it for rent.,1176940800,,413,3.6
