7914760,4,B00001TZ64,"This video very effectively combines a lot of remarkable footage of building demolitions with the music of the German electronic rock band, Tangerine Dream. (Note: The jacket says the video is 42 minutes, but the  actual running time is closer to 32 minutes.)
The demolitions are  presented both as real time views and technically manipulated works. There  is some dialog but it is used more like part of the music than as  narration. Some of the sequences are almost totally abstract art while  others are presented much like documentary  film. All are exciting.
The  music is well mated to the images in every case.
Highly recommended for  fans of Tangerine Dream.",942969600,,666,4.936936936936937
