8390139,5,B0036QZOS8,"This was a highly entertaining ""Intervention"" installment.  It had all the drama of Jerry Springer or Maury Povich!
The subject is Dillon, a hotheaded young man from Oklahoma.  Unlike other subjects, he doesn't constantly beg for money.  However, he is so verbally abusive to everyone.  This took place in the South where many parents believe in spanking.  There were several times when I thought, ""Surely one of his elders is going to take a belt to him!""  This dude had more sassmouth than Bart Simpson!
I think this was in the first season of the show, yet Dillon had seen the show before and in the middle of the episode, he figured out what was going on.  His mother does have a whiny voice, but her love for him really shined through.  When she yells ""No!"" repeatedly upon finding out that Dillon figured out the plan, I felt her pain intensely and many other viewers will too.
Dillon did like William H. Macy in ""Fargo"" and ran out of the intervention!  Plus, he had to be forced to hear out his disabled grandfather.  When the interventionist asked, ""Do you want rehab or prison?"", Dillon put his wrists together and told the police to take him away.
Wow!  Who says people over the age of 18 can't be brats?!  Dillon probably LOVES Amy Winehouse's ""Rehab"" song.  His smart-aleck-iness was highly entertaining.
This definitely is one of the best episodes evah!",1293580800,,1367,4.669456066945607
