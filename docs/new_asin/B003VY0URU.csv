Above average spaghetti. great cinematography and camerawork in the Italian Alps, refreshing change from the Tabernas Desert in Spain. Some plot elements don't work and the ending is too reminiscent of ""A Fistful of Dollars"" which lowers it to a 3.5 instead of 4. Gotta love ""The Widow"" & ""El Diablo"" though!
