The series focuses on Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies), whose husband Peter Florrick (Chris Noth), a prior Illinois, State's Attorney, has been incarcerated following an infamous party-political dishonesty and sexual impropriety. After having spent the preceding thirteen years as a homemaker mother, Alicia returns to her old job as a lawyer to afford for her two kids. Although as the series progresses Florrick is eventually released from prison and regains his political ascendancy, their nuptials and dynamic as husband and wife have irreversibly changed. The series was partly inspired by real life events, as well as by other conspicuous political sex scandals in the United States, particularly those of John Edwards and former President Bill Clinton.

This is a show that has reconnoitred the connection between technology and the law, covering themes including Bitcoin, Anonymous, viral marketing in political campaigns, speech control software, cybernetic conferencing robots, and NSA surveillance. For instance, one of the firm's regular clients is an imagined internet search company known as Chumhum, which among other subjects has faced confidentiality lawsuits for peddling users' private data to the Chinese and Syrian regimes.

Good Wife is stimulating, uncommonly good in that has smarts - but is underrated in my opinion.",1411948800,9,1364,5.70935960591133

8657141,5,B00KB01OYK,"First of all note, that in each series year, the title of the episode has as many words as the series Year. Year one- title is one word, up to year four, then, Year five- title is three words, reversing the order. It gives us a signal.

When all is said and done the one through the fifth season of The Good Wife was shocking. It brings with it the most amazing music. We Know the amazing cast, Julianne Margolis is the Good Wife, Chris Noth is the Bad Husband, and this thing about the marriage, does it break up, what does the Good Wife do, how does the family react, and what about that mother-in-law?

We know the firm where Alicia is now an attorney, Lockhart and Gardner. Will Gardner played by Josh Child's is an old lover of Alicia, Diane Lockhart, played by Christine Baranski is the other formidable partner. Archie Panjabi plays the sexy, wonderful Kalinda. Alan Cumming plays Eli Gold, the cunning chief of staff for Peter. How the world does roll.

Kalinda has a prime part in this series. She lets us know she is not gay, but she is flexible. An old flame, husband finds her, and they are not on good terms except in bed, and now in the courtroom. Expect fireworks. Peter faces a formidable political opponent as he rubs for Governor, and he faces a big surprise,  The guest stars are ever more brighter and funnier.
And, Will has the greatest part of his life as Will Gardner.

When the Good Wife started there had been a rash of good wives of politicians whose husbands had done them wrong. What a wonderful opportunity for a series. However. As the series moves along, we find Alicia Florrick as the Good Wife. Will she forgive her husband, Peter, as he Enters jail for corruption charges? As the States Attorney for Cook County will this end his career?

And, as the series follows Alicia, what happens to the Good Wife after the scandal wears down? How does the family move on, we discover all of this in season one. A remarkable cast and an excellent first season. Kudos reign for all.

8657142,4,B00KB01OYK,This DVD collection arrived in a timely fashion.  This was a gift for someone.  We have watched several episodes.  There has been no problems concerning the quality of the product.,1451347200,,180,4.933333333333334
8657143,5,B00KB01OYK,"When Season One premiered in 2009 I ignored it, having been underwhelmed by Julianna Margulies' ""Canterbury's Law"" the previous year. Early on in Season Two I caught one episode because my Yankees were getting their butts handed to them and nothing good was playing in that time slot. After seeing that episode, I promptly logged onto Netflix and rented all discs in Season One to catch up. I ran that season in a marathon and was ready for the following week's Season Two episode.

The basic premise is Alicia Florrick's return to the law that she'd studied in college before getting married, joining the firm of Lockhart & Gardner as a much-older-than-usual ""junior associate"". She has to do something to put food on the table, being that her husband Peter (Chris Noth) is in the slammer on a corruption beef. She suffers the predictable catty interventionism by Peter's mother Jackie, who's the sort of mother-in-law who '60s r&b singer Ernie K Doe sang about in his hit song. Jackie pseudo-justifies this as grandmotherly concern for Alicia's teenage son and daughter. Plus, Alicia has the usual law office politics to deal with--this on top of the legal cases she deals with day-by-day. Plus a budding romance with named partner Will Gardner, and the head-gamesmanship of fellow associate Cary Agos, whose boyish cuteness hides a conniving mind. Picture Justin Bieber as a manipulative lawyer.

I must say that Margulies has improved with age since her role as cute-in-the-right-lights young nurse Carol Hathaway on ""ER"", erstwhile love interest for George Clooney. They're saying that Margulies is about to celebrate the Big 5-0 soon, but she's more beautiful now than when she played Nurse Hathaway. I realize that early-middle-age has been kind to Jaclyn Smith and Heather Locklear, but they were both babes when they were younger. Paul McCartney had an old song about still being needed when he's 64 and I have no doubt Margulies will still turn heads at that age.",1447027200,,1973,4.993920972644377

Over all i woud give it a very good rating",1435881600,,180,4.65625
