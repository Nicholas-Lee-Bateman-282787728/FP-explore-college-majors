1265397,5,B00003CXHG,"Very funny, entertaining, and original. Although the film does drag on a bit towards the end, it's more than made up for by the great acting,  original screenplay, and the many plot twists. ""Keeping the  Faith"" breaks almost all of those romantic comedy cliches you're tired  of. I guarantee that you will like this film even if you don't normally  like romantic comedies.",968371200,,372,4.857142857142857
1265398,4,B00003CXHG,"Remember that joke about the Rabbi and the Priest?  Well, someone in Hollywood decided to make a movie out of it and while the casual observer  may think that it would be difficult to make a successful movie on such a  flimsy topic, it works and pulls at your heartstrings.
Jake Schramm and  Brian Finn had been friends since their childhood.  Every since they were  kids Jakes has wanted to be a rabbi.  He even had a set of All-Star Rabbi  collecting cards!  Brian has also been religious his whole life.  Growing  up as kids, a tomgirl by the name of Anna Riley came into their little New  York life and soon the 3 became inseperable.  However, fate would have it  that Anna's parents were moving to the sunshine of California, crushing the  bond between the three friends.
Still, life goes on and 20 years later,  we catch up with the two hip religious figures, now serving their own  faiths as Priest and Rabbi.  One of the subplots is that they want to build  a Inter-faith community center because they feel that if they can be  friends, religious denomination should not a dividing point amongst people.  Jake is the dating phase, being set up by every Jewish mother and her  sister, while Brian is living a satisfying celibate life with God as his  companion.
However this is turned upside down when Anna, on a business  trip to New York, calls them up to catch up.  She has turned into a radiant  business woman who has kept enough of her quirkiness to make her  irresistible to both men.  Jake, who starts dating her, begins to develop  commit issues because she is not Jewish (which might affect his chance of  becoming head rabbi at his synagogue) and Brian begins questioning his  faith in the Catholism because he has fallen in love so hard that he feels  he has lost his commitment to religion.
All three characters are played  well.  Jenna Elfman is the best as the irresistable Anna Riley.  She gives  her character so much charisma and is luminous on screen.  Edward Norton is  also very good as the sensitive priest who becomes hurt and discouraged  when he realizes what he thought was sexual flirtation is actually just  playfulness.  Ben Stiller plays the it straight as the Rabbi, but he tends  to become ""less than a man"" as he whines through his dilemma  about interfaith relationships.
All three of them have tremendous amounts  of chemistry (as friends and lovers) and it makes the movie even more  endearing.  So, when this movie comes out near Halloween and you are sick  of watching yet another slasher brain-drain flick, give this movie a  chance....Rating: B+
ps: Don the Crazy Chinese Karoake salesperson steals  the movie!  He is well played Ken Leung.",967680000,2,2687,4.660944206008583
1265399,5,B00003CXHG,"Stiller, Elfman, and Norton star in a comic tale of a love triangle between 3 best friends, a rabbi, priest, and their shared childhood  sweetheart.  Co-starring Ann Bancroft as Stiller's mother, the movie is  filled with great one liners and humorous twists, jesting at both  Catholicism and Judaism without ever being insulting or derogatory.",966988800,,344,5.314814814814815
1265400,2,B00003CXHG,"Over all, I think the only truly funny moments in the movie was when Norton and Stiller were children.  This movie is over two hours long, that  is just a little too long for a comedy.  It dragged quite a bit.",966729600,,209,4.048780487804878

1265840,4,B00003CXHG,"I have to admit I started watching this movie with a less than positive attitude. My previous encounters with Ben Stiller were either getting certain appendages stuck in zippers or having crocodilian's crispy heads removed geek style. I recognized Jenna Elfman from ""Krippendorf's Tribe"" (1998). So I was ready for some wasted film.
After holding my breath and waiting for it to hit. I soon realized that this was a well put together movie with a good story plot and excellent execution. I was amazed at the people that were in this movie. Half the time I keep saying ""oh look there is"" Anne Bancroft, Eli Wallach, and many others.

Basic story of three childhood friends. One went away and the other two chose to become (now don't laugh) a priest and a rabbi. The one that went away (Anna Riley) returns as a business executive and has a magnetic personality with accoutrements to match.

The fun and the drama is when two and a half become more than friend. How will they and their world react to this? What makes the movie is not the story as much as how it is executed. And it seems that I need to re-evaluate Ben Stiller as he did a fine job with just the minimum of ""spectacles, testicles, watch, wallet"".",1501459200,2,1211,4.525114155251141

I love Jenna Elfman and it is nice to see her in a role that is as far from teh hippie-chick she plays in Dharma and Greg as you can get. The movie has alot of respectful, but pointed humor based on the Catholic and Jewish faiths, which I find hysterical. The cast all work well together, adn the movie doesn't drag along in the middle like a lot of comedies.

With a priest and a rabbi fighting over a high powered business woman you know it has to be funny. It's basically the setup to a good joke.",1467849600,2,604,4.07563025210084

A rabbai (Stiller) and a priest (Norton) and their friend (Jenna Elfman) who is luminous and floats in to town to bewitch both. Mom (Bancroft) ""gets"" her and the story plays out.

Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0

 Can you imagine a scenario where you have two guys and a girl who were childhood friends and when they grow up, the two males become a priest and a rabbi and then fight over the woman? This is essentially the absurd premise of the long forgotten 2000 rom-com, 'Keeping the Faith'.

The rabbi, Jake Schram, is played by Ben Stiller. He's a progressive in a conservative synagogue, getting into trouble with the temple elders by bringing in a black gospel choir who sing the popular Jewish hymn, Ein Keloheinu. Screenwriter Stuart Blumberg attempts to elicit laughs by depicting Jake's failed dating life (he dates a neurotic nymphomaniac who is a big turn-off).

When Anna, returns to NYC after many years on the West Coast, a rivalry develops between Jake and his old friend, Brian Finn, now a Catholic priest, over their childhood girlfriend. Jenna Elfman, has nothing much to do in the role of Anna, except acting as 'eye candy' for the rival men of faith.

Ed Norton (who also directed), is saddled by a script that knows much less about Catholics than Jews. Brian ends up mistakenly believing that Anna has the hots for him, and not Jake, who she really has fallen in love with. In an uncomfortable scene, Brian confronts Anna, and ends up humiliated when she rejects him. He takes it a step further in a reversion to early adolescence, by slugging Jake in the face.

The rest of the silly plot focuses on Jake attempting to prevent his Congregation from learning that he's been dating a 'Shiksa' and dealing with his mother (Anne Bancroft), who initially is unable to tolerate the idea of her son, hooking up with a gentile.

All's well that ends well, when Jake and Brian reconcile and Anna is now taking lessons to convert to Judaism. 'Keeping the Faith' fails mainly because Anna is mainly there as a forgettable love interest, Jake's obsession with her is one-note and Brian's fall from grace, simply doesn't jibe with the reality of the majority who answer to the priest's calling.

For those interested in the evolution of screenwriter Blumberg's writing career, this is a good film to see. Blumberg did go on to co-write the commendable 'The Kids Are Alright'. Also 'Keeping the Faith' features performances by the great veterans, Anne Bancroft and Eli Wallach, now both deceased.

'Keeping the Faith' can be best described as both sentimental and not funny. DVD copies are likely to be found in your nearest remainder bin. Watch it at your own peril!",1373500800,,2530,4.755707762557078

1267373,5,B00003CXHG,"""Keeping the Faith"" (2000) is generally regarded as a light comedy romance movie. However, we believe that both Norton and Stiller would argue that ""Keeping the Faith"" is the suspenseful follow-up to Hitchcock's ""I Confess"" (1953).

Obviously, Edward Norton is Father Logan (Montgomery Clift's character) who's back on the streets. After the insanity of ""I Confess"", Logan has changed his name to Father Finn and teamed up with a rogue Rabbi in New York City. Now they've devised a murder plot against a young female executive named Anna Reilly! But she's on to the Rabbi after he starts an electrical fire at a Chinese Karaoke bar in Queens. We must stop here, for to go on would give away too much of the suspenseful plot.

Will Father Finn beat the rap? Can he stop the rogue Rabbi from destroying what's left of Queens before Reilly goes public?! ""Keeping the Faith"" is a film that we have observed but are unable to officially recommend (Norton's directing debut is well done). We will always believe that it is a sequel to ""I Confess"".",1331856000,,1041,4.745856353591161

While the idea of two guys vying for a former childhood playmate is certainly a viable premise for a romantic comedy, I simply wasn't able to swallow the idea of their being a Catholic priest and Jewish rabbi respectively.  Not for a second; and since everything that came after depended on your swallowing this, the film was painful to watch.

And overlong.  Just when you think it's about time to wrap up things, you check the Display on your DVD and see that there are over 60 minutes left!",1297468800,,742,4.271428571428571

1267379,5,B00003CXHG,"When this movie came out, some expressed surprise at Edward Norton's involvement.  This, remember, was the same guy who had taken and would continue to take the most outrageous, most provocative, nastiest roles available in mainstream Hollywood, including split-personality sufferers, high-tech thieves, white supremacists, and sleazy drug dealers.  And here he was portraying a Catholic priest of all things, and going so far as to produce and direct the thing to make sure he got the chance.  Right.

Then again, when you think about it, that was probably the most unexpected thing Edward Norton could do.  He would enjoy that, I'm sure.  What's more, consider this - hundreds of years ago it seemed that people were easily embarrassed by the fact that they had bodies, but today a lot of people seem equally embarrassed by the fact that they have souls.  Religion and spirituality are like a raw nerve.  If you're Edward Norton and you want to keep people on their toes, what better subject could you tackle?

""Keeping the Faith"" deals with three childhood friends from New York who meet up again in young adulthood.  Norton has gone to seminary and become Father Brian, Ben Stiller has done the same and become Rabbi Jake, and Jenna Elfman as Anna Riley has returned from California as a high-powered corporate fixer who's delighted at the chance to see her buddies again.  It's also noteworthy that the priest and the rabbi are both highly successful by the terms of their work, being the junior clergy at a couple of New York's biggest houses of worship.  And there's a certain amount of slapstick - Father Brian setting himself on fire with the incense burner and Rabbi Jake fainting at a circumcision - but as our story begins they have settled well into their roles and increased attendance at the church and the synagogue by several orders of magnitude with their exciting modern approach to the old verities.  They've remained close friends, too.

Actually, as our story begins, Father Brian staggers down the street as drunk as a lord, falling into trash heaps and looking to unburden himself.  He finds a sympathetic bartender and talks to him about the early years with Jake and Anna, how she came back, and what drove him to drink.  You shouldn't have much trouble guessing, but as always, it's the way the story's told that makes the movie worthwhile.

In the meantime, one of the best things about this movie is the part that is not about the relationships between these three.  Jake and Brian confer with their mentors  (Eli Wallach and Milos Forman), counsel the young people of their congregations, and make themselves useful and admirable outside of church or synagogue.  You also see them during services and admire the ways they encourage participation rather than letting the congregants sit there and fall asleep.  The story focuses more on Jake, so you get his dealings with the synagogue board, and there's a terrific scene where he brings in some special guests to conclude the Sabbath service with a bang.  And of course, Jake has one more issue to deal with that Brian does not - he's got every parent in the synagogue setting him up with their various daughters.  This is tough enough at the best of times and even more so with Anna Riley around.  Thus we come to the engine that drives the plot.

All of these performances are dead on, with particular gratitude to Ben Stiller.  He comes from a background of comic satire, where things are exaggerated to the point of silliness.  This role, thankfully, he takes seriously.  His last speech to his congregation on the holiest day of the Jewish year is a model of understatement, with the critical background of passion.  One false note and it could have ruined the whole movie.  Instead, it becomes the moment everything revolves around, even the subsequent scenes where you find out how all the problems get resolved.

Other standouts are the two older clergy, Elfman and Norton, Brian George as the somewhat confused multicultural bartender that Father Brian meets, and Ken Leung who steals his scenes trying to sell Brian and Jake a more expensive karaoke machine.  Someone ought to make a whole movie about that guy.  There's also Anne Bancroft deliciously playing Rabbi Jake's magnificent and occasionally embarrassing mother, who has a secret sorrow that kicks off Act 3.  If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Bancroft converted to Judaism when she married Mel Brooks, but whether she did or not, she makes as convincing a Jewish mother as any Italian I've ever seen.

I could get picky about some errors in Jewish practice.  In case you're interested, here's one; Rabbi Jake coaches an adolescent, whose voice is changing, in his Bar Mitzvah chant, which is hilarious when delivered.  I noticed his portion comes from the first chapter of Genesis.  Jews read that portion in late September or early October, a few weeks after Yom Kippur.  Then a few weeks later in movie time, by gum, it's Yom Kippur.  Whoops.

Well, that's what I get for having been to Hebrew school.  Maybe this movie makes similar errors in Catholic practice, I don't know.  Either way, I'll be damned if I'm going to let such trivialities overshadow the first movie in God knows how long to take people's spirituality seriously, however funny it is.  And it's very funny.

And here's one more fun detail - the plot of ""Keeping the Faith"" focuses mostly on the relationship between Rabbi Jake and Anna.  In real life, Jenna Elfman stands a few inches taller than Ben Stiller, and these moviemakers did not try to hide this nor did they bother to mention it in the script.  It's simply a fact.  That's some sort of breakthrough in Hollywood, I think.  Just one more reason to love this picture.

1267490,3,B00003CXHG,"KEEPING THE FAITH (2000), is a cinematic take on the old joke, ""A priest and a rabbi meet this blonde coming down the street. . ."" In this case, the blonde is Jenna Elfman (Anna), the priest is Edward Norton (Brian), and the rabbi is Ben Stiller (Jake), three childhood best friends.

KEEPING THE FAITH is very much about how religiously observant people balance the demands of the spiritual life against those of the temporal life; it's also about how people, observant or not, balance the demands of career against those of love and family; and last, but not least, it is about how people who love balance their self-expectations against the expectations they have of their significant others.

Brian and Jake are still best friends, dedicated to working together ecumenically, and dedicated to invigorating their congregants with a desire to become closer to God, sometimes with hilarious consequences.

Jake falls in love with Anna and Anna with Jake, but Jake can't reconcile the idea of a rabbi marrying a non-Jewish woman with the demands of his heart, and the expectations of his synagogue. While Jake struggles with this dilemma, Brian finds himself increasingly attracted to Anna (who loves, but is not in love, with him), and struggles with the demands of his heart versus his vows. When he realizes that Anna is in love with Jake, a crisis ensues.

Since Jake, Brian and Anna all fear confronting themselves and each other with these issues, their lifelong bond becomes strained and their love for each other is put to the test. In the end, all three discover, happily, that ""keeping the faith"" is in large part a question of having faith in each other.

1267582,3,B00003CXHG,"Ben Stiller and Ed Norton star as a rabbi and priest who are reunited with their friend from junior high school, a high-powered, workaholic businesswoman played by Jenna Elfman. I thought Norton and Stiller had good chemistry and were believable as life-long friends. I thought the early scenes in which a Jew and Christian become interested in each other's faith interesting. I just wished this would have been developed more throughout the film.

When Elfman's character comes into the picture, she throws her two male friends' lives for a loop. Stiller is a rabbi who is being pressured to meet and marry a nice Jewish girl, and Norton is a priest who must live a life of celibacy. Both men lust for Elfman. Stiller, who begins secretly dating Elfman, is afraid his synagogue and his congregation and family will find out that he is involved with a non-Jew. Norton contemplates violating his celibacy vows so he can be with Elfman.

My problem is that these two men swoon so much over Elfman. She is attractive but not a stunning head-turner. She's not a great actress, either, and belongs on TV. I thought another actress, maybe Cameron Diaz, might have been better in the role.

Also, it's obvious that Elfman and Stiller are in LUST, not love, as they seem to spend a lot of their time in bed with each other. Their relationship is shallow. Stiller's character, who has a history of having flings with women, seemed a bit shallow himself. Norton's character seemed a bit deeper. Another problem is that Stiller and Elfman have no real chemistry together. Elfman seemed to have more chemistry with Norton, actually.

I also think the love triangle could have used more tension, too. Elfman flirts with Norton, but once she gets involved with Stiller, she seems to treat him more like a brother. It would have complicated things more if maybe Elfman had some genuine feelings for Norton as well and then he could have very real inner turmoil about his chastity vows.

Of course, everything ends up very nice and neat and predictably, but I thought Elfman chose the wrong guy and I doubt their shallow relationship will last after the movie is over. Overall, this is an enjoyable piece of fluff if you are in the mood for a romantic comedy.",1215043200,,2243,4.741025641025641

How long has it been since we've seen a film focusing on believing/involved people of faith that wasn't either preachy and sanctimonious, or cynical and paranoid?  Let's see -- maybe Steve Martin's ""Leap of Faith"", or Denzel Washington's remake of Cary Grant's ""The Preacher's Wife.""  Maybe a couple more -- but not many.

It's nice to see a film celebrate active belief without turning into ""Father O'Malley and the Dirty Faced Street Urchins of New York"" or ""Father O'Malley and the Dirty Alter Boys of Cell Block 8.""

1267585,5,B00003CXHG,"Critics, schmitics---what I love about KEEPING THE FAITH is it's take on ecumenism and the sparkle of the characters/actors.  Perhaps all romantic comedies are, after all, mawkish, since the pattern has been around for centuries.  However, most of us do like seeing our favorites in the genre, as well as seeing the latest take on same.
Here Edward Norton's character is a priest and Jenna Elfman's is a high-powered executive just back in New York after having been away from the boys for at least a decade. Of course, Ben Stiller's character is a rabbi, to round out the threesome---""Two Micks and a Yid.""  The stage is set by Norton's character who is blitzed and telling his troubles to a sympathetic bartender, a Punjabi Catholic with Jewish in-laws.  (Norton also directs for the first time here and the tone of the whole movie is lively and positive---the characters' comedic timing is excellent.)  The plot thickens as we learn that Norton has made a romantic declaration and his suit was less than successful.  The whole celibacy thing doesn't lessen his sense of betrayal; then we learn why.
Having set themselves up to play out the usual jokes about the differences between priests and rabbis, Norton, Elfman, and Stiller have a really good time with the dialog, the scenarios, and working with such stellars as Anne Bancroft, Eli Wallach, and Milos Froman.

1267586,3,B00003CXHG,"If you are home sick and have absolutely nothing else more pressing to do, ""Keeping the Faith"" is a nice little diversion for 2 hours.

Ben Stiller is more or less Ben Stiller, with a few moments of actual minimal dramatic moments which he carries off quite well.  Jenna Elfman is beautiful, lively, and has a long career ahead of her...on television.  Ann Bancroft plays a less serious version of the same ""Jewish Mother"" she played opposite Harvey Fierstein in ""Torch Song Trilogy"", and she is absolutely adorable, as always.  It was an added treat to see the brilliant director, Milos Foreman, grace the screen as the wise old mentor to the young priest played by Edward Norton.  And as his counterpart at the Temple, Eli Wallach is charming as the soon-to-be retired Rabbi giving counsel to renegade Rabbi Jake.  However, my favorite in this assorted pool of talent was Ron Rifkin, as the Temple President eager to boot Ben Stiller from the Bimah and Temple.

Due to his immense talent, show-biz connections & charming personality Edward Norton was able to assemble a terrific cast for his directorial debut.  And for a freshman filmmaker he did a good job...a solid B+.  I have no doubt Mr. Norton will someday make other films and it will be fun to compare them to his debut in this comic romp.

The plot has elements of both comedy and drama, though it fails to take off.  The story is really not that great (it's rather uninteresting unless you're big into political correctness and ""cultural diversity"" in which case by all means this is your film), while the humor and the acting are just about average.

The movie brings to the screen the story of three friends who reunite after several years only to have the two guys fall for the girl and all that that entails.

On the positive side, it's always a pleasure to watch Edward Norton, and Ben Stiller.

On the negative side, this film does not seem to be Jenna Elfman's thing.  She seems a bit out of place.

In a nutshell, it's an ok movie if you've got nothing else to do, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.

1267693,4,B00003CXHG,"Based on my perusal of others' reviews of this movie, it seems that some people were expecting something monumental and profound, and hence were disappointed. I don't know why they had such lofty expectations; ""Keeping the Faith"" is just one of many in the 'romantic comedy' genre. Given this however, it's for the most part an enjoyable movie, if not entirely believable. Heck; reality itself is unbelievable half the time, so just suspend the tendency to hyperevaluate if you'd like to appreciate this one.

This is my first introduction to Edward Norton, and I think he was a stand-out, both as actor and first-time director. The DVD includes some deleted scenes, a few of which I'm very thankful WERE deleted. The movie could have benefited from some further editing as well, but at least the worst bits were scrapped. Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman don't have that much 'chemistry', and efforts to force the fit would not have served the story well.

There are several veteran actors among the supporting players, Ann Bancroft and Eli Wallach among them, giving ""Keeping the Faith"" a bit of a boost. Also enjoyable are the glimpses of the three leads' characters (Norton, Stiller, Elfman) as adolescent friends. If you'd just like to have a few laughs at the follies of human beings and the nature of their relationships, ""Keeping the Faith"" is well worth the time investment.",1126137600,4,1379,4.914163090128755

I think Ed Norton is better suited to a tough guy role because he was a little dorky in this, but he wasn't too bad at the comedy thing.  The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I hate the way American films portray Judiasm.  If you are Jewish you'll know what I mean.  I loved the Kareokee sales guy.  He was hillarious.

1267695,3,B00003CXHG,"I love the beginning of this movie more than any other part. Not only is it the funniest, but it's also the part with the most truth to it. Both the rabbi and the priest challenge their congregation to examine what real faith means instead of carrying along with their banal religions. I really admire anybody who shakes things up the way they do in the beginning of the movie; any Christian who complains about that method has forgotten something very important about Christ: he caused lots of trouble for the Pharisees so set in their formulaic rules that they'd forgotten what authentic faith is about. Although I've never been a Ben Stiller fan, he does an alright job in this movie although I don't like his character as much as the priest. Rabbi Jake and Anna basically fall in lust, not love, but they're used synonymously in our culture. I had a hard time believing that Ben Stiller's character would have so easily jumped into a lust-based relationship and be okay with that as a man of God.

1267696,1,B00003CXHG,"This movie is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long, long, time... I feel horrible that I wasted money renting this movie. I also thought maybe this religious comedy would have as much charm as Saved had- but, I was wrong...Also being a Ben Stiller fan I figured that I should give this flick a shot.

The story centers around three child-hood friends who grew up together in New York Jake, Brian, and their tom-boyish friend Anna. When Anna moves away Jake and Brian are left to themselves... Jake eventually becoming a rabbi and Brian becoming a Catholic priest- both of them trying to reach their congergations with new-age techniques using bongo drums, high powered songs, and sermons with meaning-- even going to the extent of opening a inter-faith karaoke naming themselves the ""God Squad""... Well Anna returns to New York all grown up and beautiful work addict. With a position opening up for head rabbi at Jake's temple he is sent on a series of horrible dates so he can marry a nice Jewish girl before long he realizes how much he cares for Anna-- only problem she's not Jewish. And to top that off Jake realizes he cares for her as well...

All in all it sounds about as good as the plot is which is horrible... this movie has nothing to do with faith, meaning, or purpose like ""Saved!"" delievered and it's not one of Ben Stiller's more charming performances. Jenna Elfman is also no actress.

If you want a smart and endearing movie about all the things you are searching for purpose, meaning, love, then buy ""Saved!"" and forget ""Keeping the Faith.""",1110585600,,1568,4.5928571428571425
1267697,5,B00003CXHG,"Top to bottom this movie is very good.  On its simplest level it is an Arthurian romance (all three characters care deeply about one another and form an odd and dysfunctional love triangle).  On this level it is a comedy and a decent movie.

At a deeper level it talks about the priests vow of celebacy, a rabbi and a gentile relationship, and how profoundly faith enters the picture for two ""young"" men (and, indirectly, a young woman) looking for a relationship.

My favorite scenes in the whole movie were where the older ""spiritual guides"" come across as strong mentors rather than stick-in-the-mud characters.

Rabbi Lewis: I know, I know, you like to shake things up and that's good, but sometimes people need to feel led instead of pushed.

Older priest:  That is my recruitment pitch.  It makes you feel like a marine.  The truth is that no matter what you do in life it is a choice, a choice you make every day.  I've been a priest for over 40 years and have fallen in love at least once every decade.

These are all refreshing images in a culture increasingly hostile to these two ancient faiths.  The characters actually grow and change, find out more about themselves and one another.  About the meaning of friendship and honesty.

Rabbi Jake:  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Do you hear what you are saying?  You are complaining that I wasn't sensitive to the fact that my friend, A CATHOLIC PRIEST, might have a CRUSH on my SECRET GIRLFRIEND?!",1109376000,3,1445,4.625984251968504

Many of us are lucky enough to make lasting friendships in school; sadly for one reason or another (relocation, different colleges, varying careers), many of these friendships fade away.
This is a story of two boys and a girl whose friendship as children was as good as it could get. Now years later, the boys are into religion: one (Norton) an ordained Catholic priest working with youth, the other (Stiller) a Jewish rabbi auditioning for a congregation. Meanwhile, in a nice little twist, the girl (Elfman) has become a high powered businesswoman. The movie explores what happens when they meet again. The friendship is every bit as good as it used to be  the days seem hardly to have passed. But as adults, they have new priorities, new ambitions that complicate the picture. Happy as Norton is with his vocation, Elfman awakens questions in him (of relationships, of marriage, of sex) that he thought were settled, but in fact has no answers for. Stiller has other problems with his evident attraction to Elfman and hers for him. A rabbi unlike a priest is free (in fact almost expected!) to marry; yet marriage to a girl who is not Jewish (she is catholic) would jeopardize his ambition to be rabbi of an influential congregation where he can make a difference. Both Norton and Stiller are simultaneously battling conservative elders to draw more youth to their respective services. Elfman herself seems to be weighing career and family options. These are no perfect cut-outs; they are basically decent people with human flaws. Faced with choices that impact their fundamental beliefs, they struggle, make mistakes, hurt themselves and each other. The ending may be predictable, but they way Norton (who also directs) gets to the end is top quality. The film is filled with vignettes of humor.

I mean, Anna); that there's not much onscreen chemistry between them.  Elfman is the real problem--her jump from TV to the big screen just isn't convincing.

""That's easy: Anna Riley, in eighth grade.""

Keeping the Faith is a really sweet and funny film about a rabbi, a priest, and a hot and successfull business woman who get together again for the first time since 8th grade, when they were best friends all three of them. As you can imagine, the faith issues, the friendship, and the fact that they all now have adult desires makes for a messy story, but a lot of fun.

The reason I review it on this site is simple: Jenna Elfman. In short, she is not only cool, she is also HOT. The clincher is the extra scene, cut from the film but made it onto the DVD's bonuses, of Jenna (Anna) and her vibrating cell phone. I don't recall having seen a scene before that was both funny and so sexy I could hardly sleep after. Get the DVD if you can.

1267907,4,B00003CXHG,"What can you say about Edward Norton?  Acquiring quite the cult following many people are seeking out all of his films just to watch his performance, and I am one of them.  Here he acts in, directs and co-produces a movie of a kind that he's never been in before: a romantic comedy.  And it fares pretty well compared to similar films.  The story concerns two best friends, a rabbi and a priest, who are both in love with the same girl from their childhood.  Norton's the priest, Stiller the rabbi and Elfman the girl.
Of course this is the kind of predicatable stuff romantic comedies are made out of, but there is a little something else here that does make you take more notice.  Of course there are the performances.  Norton at first seems to be taking on a role where he takes himself less seriously, yet as the movie progresses the small intricacies of his performance become apparent, in particular his internal struggle between faith and love.  Stiller is a real shock in that he not only acts out the slapstick humour with his usual aplomb but also the dramatic elements with an ease that surely cries out for some more serious roles.  Elfman is also a complete joy, managing to be self-asserted, fun and vulnerable all at the same time.  Having never seen Dharma and Greg I was completely unaware of what a charismatic actress she was, but judging by this film she hopefully has great things ahead of her.
Another point of the movie that makes it at least stand out from the crowd somewhat is its discussion of priorities, faith, religion, work and love.  Whilst obviously more pertinent to the 30-somethings that Keeping The Faith is understandably aimed at (after all, Norton is one himself), this by no way means that it is alienating to any other audience.  Speeches about whether finding love or getting a good job should be your main priority may seem slightly ill-judged when coming out of the characters' mouths, they at least seem a  realistic protrayal of what they are thinking, even if it doesn't sound like something they'd actually say.
Before the movie descends into clich with a last run to get the girl and a smiling photo snap, there is also a lot of light humour that is carried very deftly by Norton and Stiller.  In particular, the introduction of their religions is particularly inspired, creating harmless fun from a very touchy area.  Whilst this may never be a classic in its own right, this is gentle watching that is a touch above other romantic comedies simply because its characters are all too endearing and fun to make you reach for your sick buckets.  Whilst it may not be entirely original, that doesn't mean that there's no originality in it, and it marks an impressive directorial debut from Norton.",1042070400,3,2744,4.673596673596673

What gets lost in all this is the fact that many highly intelligent people enjoy watching these movies because they are FUN.  Even if I know  (or think I know) how a movie will turn out in the end, I can still have FUN while I'm getting there.  You know what fun is, right?

Let me assure my fellow ""religious"" people: this movie doesn't wuss out.  The catholic Priest isn't an uptight jerk, and he isn't a total saint.  He's *shock"" Edward Norton: a NICE GUY who feels called to his work and wants to make a difference.  The Rabbi isn't some wise old guy who's used as a plot device to deliver either crucial advice or comic relief.  Instead, he's Ben Stiller--a pretty nice younger guy who's torn between pleasing others and doing what's right for himself.  The priest and the rabbi have been friends since childhood.  When another childhood friend comes back into their lives after years of separation, they both fall in love with her.  Oops.
The Priest doubts his calling when he struggles with his love for a woman who happens to be in love with his best friend, and the Rabbi alternates between struggling to make faith seem real to the people in his congregation and lashing out/ hurting his friends/ being a total jerk.  Surprise!  These are real people.  They're not always nice.  Their faith isn't a crutch, it isn't a band aid, it isn't an insult to the audience.  It's a real and living thing that they struggle to understand as they try to pass it on to others.
The Rabbi falls in love with a woman who doesn't share his faith.  Oh no!  What will people think?  What should he do?  Jenna Elfman's speech to him about how she admires his faith and she's trying to understand it even though it's not easy for her is one of the most touching moments in a movie chock full of touching moments.  Maybe that's why the critics didn't like this movie.  Critics seem to hate touching moments.  Touching moments happen all the time in real life, that's why they're predictable.
I expected to have fun with this movie, and I did--rolling with laughter more than once.  But I was also enlightened and rewarded with a film that allowed me to think a little deeper about everything I hold dear.
While the priest and the rabbi never walk into a bar together, the movie still manages to be funny.  And the love story is everything love stories should be: sappy, sweet, and ultimately satisfying.  As an added bonus, you can ponder some deeper questions of faith and savor the unexpected delight of seeing true friendship realistically portrayed.  Relax, take a deep breath, remove the stick from your butt, and enjoy.",1041984000,20,3317,4.541315345699831

1267914,3,B00003CXHG,"Keeping The Faith (2000) is a light, entertaining and contemporary romantic comedy.  The setup sounds very corny but it works.  Jacob, played by Ben Stiller is Jewish.  Brian, played by Edward Nortan, is Irish Catholic, and Anna, played by Jenna Elfman, is an Irish Catholic girl.  All three were best friends growing up in Brooklyn.  In the eighth grade, Anna's family moves to California.  Remaining best friends, Jacob grows up to become a rabbi, Brian a priest.  When they are in their thirties, Ruth contacts Brian to tell him she is coming to New York for a few weeks.  Jacob and Brian have not seen or spoken to Anna in twenty years.  She is now a high-powered businesswoman.  Jacob and Brian meet her at the airport together.
The actress Jennie Elfman's looks are quite captivating.  She is very tall, taller than both guys, very thin and very blonde.  Both men's passions ignite and burn wild.  The rest of the movie is a love triangle made interesting because of all the things that priests and rabbis are not supposed to do.
I liked the scenes involving the synagogue congregation.  It's not something that one sees in many movies.  I felt that the image of the priest as sexually emasculated was very sad.  A fair attempt is made at balancing it, but it fails.  Other actors you may recognize in the film are Ann Bancroft who plays Jacob's mother and Ron Rifkin who plays a senior rabbi.  Milos Forman who plays Brian's pastor has a good scene near the end, counseling Brian.",1026604800,,1487,4.653846153846154

It ended being such a funny, enjoyable, and cute film that I can say that any move Ben Stiller is in is gonna be great, and I will never doubt Edward Norton again, either.  His directing is superb--he keeps it really spontaneous and honest and real rather than glossy and scripted.  Even though the actual premise is admittedly pretty farfetched, there is a lot of truth to the emotions and human reactions, making it a very moving movie.  Jenna Elfman is a real treat, she is very very gifted--who knew????  So definitely rent this movie.",1022284800,2,636,4.401709401709402
1268015,5,B00003CXHG,"They say Faith can move mountains. They say Faith can get you through the turmoil of life. What happens though when your Faith in God runs headlong into your Love of a woman? Can the two exist if the woman is of a different Faith? Can it exist if you are the leader of your denomination? Ed Norton's directorial debut examines this in what could be a serious movie but is a very funny romantic movie.
 We start with Father Brian Finn, Ed Norton, stumbling drunk and landing in an all night bar. He ends up telling the story to a world-weary bartender who claims to have heard it all. The bartender knew he had heard it all when it started with, ""There's this Priest and a Rabbi..."" Actually the story doesn't start there though.
 Approximately 16 years early Brian Finn and Jacob Schram, two best friends, met their soul mate Anna Riley. She was the kind of girl all boys wanted to be around, cute but not too girlish. These three are never seen without each other. Disaster strikes 2 years later when Anna's father is moved across the country to New York. The three occasionally keep in touch through letters but think that their partnership is over.
 We jump to the future where the two boys have taken interesting jobs. It seems Brian and Jake, Ben Stiller, have always had a calling and that calling was to preach the word. Brian has become a Priest and Jake is now a Rabbi. Both are the hottest things to hit their respective Church's and are shaking things up with contemporary ideas. They are even jokingly known in the streets as ""The God Squad."" They reach some opposition from the old-line members of their respective congregations however the increased numbers at each service is hard to argue with.
 One fine day Brian informs Jake that their old friend, Anna is going to be coming to New York for work and wants to get together with them. Both are stunned to find their gangly tomboyish friend has grown up to be a stunning workaholic played by Jenna Elfman.
 Here's where the story really gets interesting. The three friends begin palling around again and getting to know everything about them. Anna is basically the proto-typical 2000 woman. She is so busy working that she rarely has time to go out with men in fact as she puts it, she has a relationship with her phone. Anna is more interested in getting to know about the two guys. She finds it fascinating that the two men are so dedicated to their churches and attends services at both. She also is interested in knowing how they are going to get their Catholic/Jewish Community Center opened. However what interests her the most is the men's relationship issues. She quizzes Brian about his faith and of course about his vow...the big vow...and wants to know what is going on with Jake and his women. I say women because all the women at the Synagogue are desperate to get their daughters married off to the young Rabbi. This leads to a couple of wonderful dates for Jake.
 Problems occur with all this time spent together though. Brian begins to question his vows of Celibacy more and more as he is around Anna. Even more of a problem though occurs between Anna and Jake as they fall in love. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if Jake was just your normal attendee of the Synagogue however being a Rabbi up for his own church? Well let's just say it isn't looked upon too well to be going out with a blonde Irish girl if you want to lead a Synagogue.
 Since this is a Romantic/Comedy we know how it is going to end. The pleasure of the movie is watching how they get there. All three actors deliver superb performances. We knew Ed Norton was a great actor but Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman more than stand with him in terms of comedic timing and drama. I was doubly impressed that Jenna, unlike some other television actresses, was able to successfully shed her television persona for a new gig.
 The dialogue was rapid fire and funny. The timing of the movie was also well paced. We had seen early evidence of Ed Norton's abilities when he helped out trimming down American History X and he continues to do a great job with the reins fully in his hands. This was definitely worth full price at the theater and is a great Date Movie.",1020211200,8,4209,4.485639686684073
1268016,5,B00003CXHG,"This is one of those films that you just fall into.  Like one of my other favorites, The Cutting Edge, the movie was modest at the box office but came out like gangbusters when it came out on video.  That is how I discovered the film.
I remember seeing the ads and cringing slightly, knowing there was going to be a romantic theme and Edward Norton played a Catholic priest.  Norton and Ben Stiller as his best friend, a Jewish Rabbi, have great chemistry.  Add Jenna Elfman as their favorite ""girl"" friend from childhood and you've got yourself a romantic triangle.
Of course, I knew how the movie was going to end up at the end, but I still enjoyed it.  The DVD has deleted scenes and a blooper reel that is hilarious.",1018396800,5,720,4.383458646616542
1268017,4,B00003CXHG,"Edward Norton burst on the scene by playing a psychopathic killer in 1996's Primal Fear. His reputation was secured afterwards by his performances as a reformed neo-Nazi in American History X and as the nameless narrator in Fight Club. it is perhaps not so surprising that he chose to balance this tendency towards seriousness by choosing a romantic comedy for his first directorial job. The result is Keeping the Faith, an affable and charming movie whose main fault is its rather long running time. This is a weakness common among actors turned director. It was probably inevitable that Norton should also do this, as his best friend, Stuart Blumberg, wrote the script. More on that later.
Brian Finn and Jake Scram [Norton and Ben Stiller] have been friends since childhood. Brian is an Irish Catholic lad, while Jake is a Jew. In the marvelous melting pot that is New York City, this is not at all an uncommon union. What turns out to be unusual is that Brain becomes a priest and Jake a rabbi. When they were kids, there was a third best pal, a girl named Anna Riley [Jenna Elfman]. She moved away in the eighth grade and eventually became but a memory. In the first part of the movie, Anna returns to New York and hooks up with her old buddies. She has become a beautiful and successful young woman. Jake and Brian are both smitten, and therein lies the crux of the comedy. Brian, of course, has his vow of chastity, which until Anna's arrival seems to have not been a problem for him. As for Jake, his congregation assumes that this most eligible bachelor will choose a nice Jewish girl. There is a lot of pressure on Jake, who is barraged by mothers pushing their daughters on him. In one of the movie's funniest scenes, Jake's date with Ali Decker [Lisa Edelstein] turns into one that he will never forget. How will Brian and Jake resolve the Anna dilemma, which threatens both their friendship and their careers? Isn't this a no win situation for all three?
One of the movie's big advantages is that Edward Norton and Stuart Blumberg really are an Irish kid and a Jewish one being best friends. They are New Yorkers and have lived together for several years. As a result, they were able to find New York locations rarely seen on film. This give the picture a fresh look and also makes the city look much more livable than it often does. The acting is first rate, as you would expect. Norton does have a flair for comedy, although he needs to work a bit on the physical aspects of it. Ben Stiller is one of the funniest men alive, and Jenna Elfman departs for once from her famous television persona. The running time of over two hours is excessive for this type of entertainment and slows the film down, but it does not ruin it by any means. It is simply something Norton should be aware of on his next project.
Perhaps the best thing about Keeping the Faith is its innocence. Lately there have been a number of often good but quite cynical comedies. It is godd to see one where you can laugh at your fellow man and still feel great about the human race.",1016409600,4,3064,4.492831541218638
1268018,3,B00003CXHG,Keeping the Faith - I found Jenna Elfman's character totally unbelievable. The idea that this tall beautiful blond woman would fall for the short nebish Ben Stiller is only plausible in the movies. Edward Norton should stick to Dramas like American History X and Fight Club. He struggles with the comedic material.  The plot of two men vying for the same woman is nothing new adding the twist of one being a rabbi and one being a priest only makes the story less credible. Stiller does give a much better performance than some of his previous efforts. If you enjoy mindless comedy with the typical romantic understory then this movie is for you. Be prepared there is nothing in this movie you haven't seen before.,1008028800,,713,4.704

Friendship, love, spontaneity, spirituality and fun mix with religion, tradition, duty, and ritual. How Stiller, a rabbi, Norton, an Irish Catholic priest, and Elfman, an Irish Catholic gal struggle to balance these is a joy. The supporting cast is terrific also, especially Anne Bancroft as Stiller's mom.
It is brilliant how such serious issues can be dealt with in such a light hearted and comical way. The fine soundtrack also compliments the movie. One standout tune is ""Heart of Mine,"" sung by Peter Salett at the end of the film.

1268096,3,B00003CXHG,"Edward Norton's directorial debut, ""Keeping the Faith"" dishes out one of those plots that only Hollywood - in its desperation to bring a fresh approach to a stale genre - would ever dare to come up with.  In this love triangle with a ""twist,"" Ben Stiller, Edward Norton and Jenna Elfman portray a trio of best friends who grew up together on the streets of New York City, but who were separated in adolescence when Anna moved away with her family to California.  The unique aspect of this particular triumvirate is that, while Anna has been away on the west coast forging a lucrative career in business for herself, Brian has become a priest and Jake has become a rabbi.  Now all three are in their '30 and Anna has decided to pay her ""buddies"" a visit - a move that sets the story up for all the interpersonal and emotional complications that are practically de rigueur for a ""Jules and Jim"" scenario of this sort.
Given the rather incredible nature of the premise, ""Keeping the Faith"" still manages to generate some interest with the uniqueness of its religious context.  Like most American movies that attempt to deal with issues of spirituality and religion, ""Keeping the Faith"" spends most of its time batting away at the edges of the topic rather than getting right in there and really opening up the subject for us.  Indeed, very few commercial American films are even willing to tackle or explore in any great depth the role that religion and spirituality play in the lives of people, so we should at least give ""Keeping the Faith"" credit for trying. Of course, much of the tension in the film is supposed to be generated by the fact that one point of this triangle (the priest, Brian) has pulled himself out of the equation - or has he?  But if the truth be told, the love triangle, which takes center stage in the film, is actually far less interesting than the issues of faith, of tradition vs. relevance, of spiritual commitment on the part of both clergy and laypeople that the film at least sporadically addresses.
Almost inevitably, with a film this lightweight in tone, ""Keeping the Faith"" seems from time to time to be afflicted with a severe case of the ""cutes,"" particularly when it succumbs to the ""golly gee, people of the cloth are just regular folk like the rest of us"" syndrome that seems somehow unavoidable in films like this.  Thus, despite their clerical status, Jake and Brian cuss, drink alcohol, play basketball, sing karaoke etc. just to show us what regular guys they are.  We've seen this sort of religious iconoclasm used for comic effect so many times before that it has long since lost the ability to amuse.
Where the film does excel, though, is in its exploration of the issue (faced by many churches and synagogues, no doubt) of whether tradition alone can sustain a viable congregation or whether unorthodox methods may be needed to reach and retain a more ""entertainment-oriented"" generation of worshippers.  Many times in the film, I found myself wishing that the story would concentrate less on the rigmarole surrounding the love triangle itself and more on issues like these.  However, even within the confines of the romantic nature of the story, the filmmakers do manage to touch, if only superficially, on the issues of Catholic priest celibacy and interfaith marriages.
Stiller, Norton and Elfman give generally naturalistic performances, though none of them are forced to stretch their talents too much in these roles.  Interestingly, famed director Milos Forman shows up as a wise old priest who sets Brian straight on the thorny issue of celibacy.
""Keeping The Faith"" probably would have been a better film had it dealt with the same issues in a less frivolous and trivial context than is provided for them here.  Still, we should, I suppose, be thankful that any American film is willing to acknowledge religion and spirituality as part of our lives at all.  ""Keeping the Faith"" is, therefore, well worth checking out.",992044800,14,3970,4.79502196193265

But then I got a whiff of the promotional campaign for the film and got scared away.  And then a friend heartily recommended the film so I did eventually go see it.  And my verdict is... is that it's exactly the type of movie promised by the ad posters and trailers.  It's all fluff and it does not deal with the issue of inter-faith relationships with any depth.  And I thought the last 30 minutes of the movie was never gonna end as it relentlessly maneuvered towards that pointless happy ending.  But there are still many enjoyable moments such as the scene with the hilarious karaoke salesman.  Ben Stiller is also an absolute hoot and he is, hands-down, the best comedic actor working in movies today.

1268098,4,B00003CXHG,"I wasn't sure what to expect out of this movie. The idea of two best friends, one Catholic the other Jewish, growing up to become a priest and a Rabbi sounded appealing. However, the previews for the movie made the film appear to be a slapstick comedy centered around the differences of religion. However, as it turns out, Ed Norton is almost as good a director as he is an actor and prevents the movie from becoming farcical or too serious.
The movie revolves around the two said best friends and how they both end up falling in love with the same girl; a girl who used to live in their neighborhood but who is now all grown up, more beautiful than ever, and a top business executive.  The film starts out great, examining the friendship and lives of the two friends. However, once the girl from next door shows up, the tone of the movie changes and instead of being a religious comedy examining the close friendship of a rabbi and priest, it becomes a dramatic romance with a few comic moments here and there. Not that the romantic angle isn't interesting, but the heart of this movie isn't about romantic love. The center of this movie is about friendship and faith.
All three of the major actors pull off strong performances and Norton continues to amaze with his range as an actor. The film also boosts a strong supporting cast which makes the film even more enjoyable to watch. A great movie overall as long as you have a little bit of faith.",988675200,2,1448,4.464150943396226

1268100,4,B00003CXHG,"A charming tale about love, faith, and what happens when you mix the two together, Keeping the Faith is one of those films that you will either love because of the extremely likeable characters that you get to know so well, or that you will dislike because it may seem like a formula comedy that runs a bit too long (2 hours, 9 minutes). Personally I loved it for both those reasons. I came to adore all the characters, namely because in each of them I saw frail human qualities that I also shared, and also because Ben Stiller, Jenna Elfman, and Ed Norton all give superb performances that leave you laughing, crying, and laughing once again. And yet, because I loved these characters, I did not want the movie to end and therefore was pleased by its excessive length, and by the additional half an hour of footage on the DVD!
The DVD is definitely worth buying if you really liked this film because the extra features are too awesome to resist. TONS of deleted scenes and a LONG production gag reel make this a great one to own, and Edward Norton fans cannot NOT buy this disc because you can even watch the movie with Mr. Norton, aka the director and producer of the film, providing a running commentary on every aspect of the film and the making of it.",986947200,,1256,4.418103448275862

Many years later,they find out that Anna is coming back to New York. And this is the beginning of a very funny and romantic movie.
You should not expect a pure comedy out of this one,like ""There's something about Mary"" or ""Meet the parents"",otherwise you may be a bit disappointed. There are numerous funny parts,but it has also very clever and important messages about the faith in god,religions and people's understanding of religions.
All three actors have good performances in the movie but I especially liked Jenna Elfman. I should also add that while Edward Norton is one of the best actors alive today,I have certain doubts about his directing ability. He is not a great storyteller,and this reflects on the unnecessary length of the movie.
On the DVD,I recommend you to watch the deleted scenes because they are very important in my opinion,and should have stayed in the final version.(though it is understandable why they didn't..The movie would be longer than Gladiator).

Ed Norton is brilliant as the Catholic priest rethinking his vows as he considers his love for Elfman.  For anyone wondering what it must be like to be celibate and strongly tempted - this must be it.  As always, Ben Stiller is wonderfully sweet and funny.

Keeping the faith was fresh and funny, however I don't think I would have loved it half as much if I hadn't gotten the DVD version with the opportunity to see the deleted scenes.  I think that in some DVD's the scenes that you get are kind of a let down, but sometimes there are some scenes where you just ask yourself, why didn't they leave it in!  The deleted scenes that you will find in keeping the faith are just that, scenes that are hilarious (most of them) and the scene with the cell phone is a pay off for something that was set up in the middle of the movie and then never followed through on with the release version of the film.  If you watch this movie for the first time, get it on DVD and watch the deleted scenes,(but wait until you have already watched the whole film, it's even funnier when you know the setups for the scenes)  You'll laugh until you have to wet nap the appolstery at Jenna Elfmann's facial expressions in the cell phone scene.",984441600,2,1000,4.214659685863874

1268185,4,B00003CXHG,"I watched this DVD yesterday...I must admit.  I was expecting alot more comedy than was delivered.  The movies started out very funny.  I was laughing...however, it became way too serious and focused too heavily on lust more than love.  The character of Anna, in my opinion was more of a qsuado-seductress than a loveable tomboyish best friend all grown up and both the Priest and the Rabbi fall for her.  It is more Seduction than falling in love.  I don't know.  I liked the movie.  But I can't say It is something somethat I would watch over and over again.....
Still worth 4 stars......Excellent directorial debut by Norton...",984009600,,630,4.768518518518518
1268186,3,B00003CXHG,"Being the movie illiterate that I am (and proud of it), movies like this reinforce my mindset to remain one.
The media tend to represent clergy as either morons or with-it guys.  Here is perfect example. Two young clergy, shake up the faith with more worship style like David Letterman.  Believers of all faiths resent having their sacredness made light of in this way.  Clergy speak for God, not to entertain.
Funny parts are in this film however.  Really enjoyed the young Jewish boy reciting Gen. 1:1 with the changing voice.  That was good.
Friendships are important.  But what of the faith of these three, especially the two lovers who are (as typical Hollywood does) leaves nothing to the imagination or privacy of two adults with their intimacy.  Doesn't speak much of their faith from Old or New Testaments about remaining pure for one's husband or wife.
Would not view this one again.  There are videos that are watched over and over.  Can't get enough of them.  This doesn't come close to being in that category.

I will not go into much detail over the movie, since you can read it as listed above, what I will state however was that I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.  The casting was excellent, Ben Stiller was a riot, and was not to over the top in this movie.  Jenna Elfman was lovable as ever, and Edward Norton rounded at the cast brilliantly.  The DVD version of the movie was great with the extra's provided.  I think this where the movie really shines.  Some of the deleted scene's were such a riot, I could not believe they left them out of the movie (Cell phone scene!) 5 stars to extras, I have yet to watch the commentary due to lack of time.  The sound and picture quality were what to be expected on DVD.  In all a worthy DVD to purchase if you like a romantic comedy.

1268189,2,B00003CXHG,"Another romantic comedy, staring Ben Stiller star of Mystery Men, Directed and co.-starring Edward Norton, and the love of both of their lives Jenna Elfman, of TV's Dharma & Gregg. Probably one of the funniest romantic comedies, great chemistry between everyone and a generally witty screenplay.  Ben Stiller is a Rabbi, Edward Norton is a priest, and Jenna Elfman is a workaholic, long time friend of both of them. Ben and Edward have not seen Jenna in over 10 years and don't realize that she will be completely different. She is not a tough tom boy anymore, she is a grown up women.  Finally they meet, and eventually they both figure out that they are in love with her, it just takes to much of the movie to find that out, and that is what is depressing.  It does have a wildly funny, witty script, great chemistry, and good performances, but towards the end turns to Melodramatic, dopey and dumb.  It can be funny, it can be cute, and it can be enjoyable, but some things can't save films, such as the fact that I believe that Jenna Elfman ends up with the wrong guy, and it is shocking to think that just that can ruin a movie, but it did, I have no interest in seeing it again because she ended up with the wrong guy.

1268190,5,B00003CXHG,"This was a wonderful movie, if not a tad too long. Funny, thoughtful, and at times, damn-near heartwarming. Ed Norton has always been a stellar actor, but never so warmly appealing before as he is as Father Brian Finn, an Irish Catholic Priest in Manhattan. This is also Norton's directorial debut. A good start for a great star! His best friend in the movie is Ben Stiller's character(played with humor and an affective broodiness)Rabbit Jacob Schrahmn. The 2 were childhood buddies who remained strong friends into adulthood, both pursuing careers related to their religions: Judaism and Catholicism. When their long lost friend from childhood Anna walks back into their lives they both fall for her, and this is where the movie cooks with fun, sprit, a subtle wit, and warmth of heart. There are some tense moments with confrontation, questioning of faith,and you really feel bad for Anna and for Father Brian.  The only bad things I can say about this film is that it is predictable, it's a bit long for the kind of plot that it has ( a thin one) and you are never really given enough insight into Stiller's character as to why Anna falls for him as opposed the the more lovable priest. And it would have made a more interesting plot to have them in a tryst instead anyway. But all in all, there is a fun spirit to this film. IT discusses religion as if religion is an agreeable belief the world over, and we just can't agree on the structure of which to base it on. It has strong likable characters, a fair if not great soundtrack, and enjoyable dialougle. A fantabulous date flick be you Jewish, Catholic or even Atheist!",981331200,2,1627,4.629757785467128
1268191,3,B00003CXHG,"KEEPING THE FAITH is set in NYC where Pastor Brian(Norton), and Rabbi Jacob(Stiller) have their friendship tested when an old mutual female friend, Anna(Elfman), pays them an unexpected visit.  Of course, they both fall head over heels with the successful young wall-street type and chaos ensues as the seductions and self-analyses commence.
The subsequent turmoil turns in some of the best original comedy I've seen from a movie in a long time.  From the Irish bar run by a Punjabi, through the ""Heroes of the Torah"" - the comedy is delivered thick and fast.  In fact, I cannot say enough about the humor that is dished out in this movie.  It is simply fun!
In his directorial debut, Edward Norton does a fine job of handling some pretty outstanding talent and is able to hold his own on-screen with Stiller.  Ben Stiller is true to form and provides a character of some depth while managing not to take himself too seriously - a talent that is required of the best comedy actors.
Some exceptional supporting characters provide another uplift to this movie and I'll mention by name Ken Lueng who plays a karaoke salesman and Brian George - the 'Irish' bartender.
I would be lying if I didn't tell you that I didn't want to watch KEEPING THE FAITH and that my wife talked me into it.  So here's the tip to all the married/dating guys out there: buy this movie and watch it with the wife/girlfriend - you will earn some brownie points and have a pretty good time yourselves!",980467200,,1473,4.624521072796935
1268272,3,B00003CXHG,"After seeing the trailer for Keeping the Faith I planned to run away from ever seeing it.  The trailer was packed with silly physical comedy pratfalls and nonsense - not the kind of film to see and certainly not the kind in which one would expect to find an actor like Edward Norton starring, let alone directing.  But pushed by trusted friends who assured me of the film's quality, I broke down and saw Keeping the Faith.  It turned out to be a bright spot in a dreary 2000 moviegoing year.
Norton's film follows the simple comedic/romantic comedy scenario that three childhood friends (Norton, Stiller and Elfman) are reuniting after more than a decade apart.  Of course the twist is that the boys have become a priest and a rabbi (sounds like a bad joke) and the girl became a powerful business consultant - some would say pretty, but this is Elfman generally more coltish than pretty.  The three are reunited and both men find themselves attracted to Elfman (God only knows why), for Stiller it's a problem because she's not Jewish and he fears upsetting his mother and the synagogue.  Norton on the other hand has to confront his vows.  Naturally, as one would expect from such a movie, everything works out, people laugh, cry and it all ends wonderfully.
Pretty run-of-the-mill stuff, but Norton does give it an edge.  Either Norton or the scriptwriter have infused a tremendous amount of personality into the priest and rabbi characters.  Of course with two talents such as Norton and Stiller it sould not be surprising these two will deliver good performances.  The pratfall scenes from the trailer weigh-down the first few minutes of the film but after that, the film exhibits what good dialogue and talented actors can do.  Good comedic bits and many, many sly cultural references from Tony Robbins to Rainman find their way into the film.  Even Elfman is semi-interesting and almost attractive in her blah role as the love interest.  At the end too, Norton's movie has actually made the audience care and suffer with the two male leads, even if we know how it will end.  Good job.  Hopefully next time he'll make something with a bit more punch though.",979084800,,2163,4.745989304812834

A Jewish rabbi and a Catholic priest both have fallen in love with a childhood friend, beauty Jenna Elfman, who is in love with the rabbi.  It is a story about a priest's struggling with his vocation, and coming to terms with it, as well a struggle of a rabbi looking for a Jewish wife.  After the rabbi admits he has fallen in love with Elfman, she admits she's converting to the Jewish faith.  The movie had some comical parts, and at the end, it makes you smile since they have overcome their conflicts.",978048000,,580,4.495238095238095
1268274,4,B00003CXHG,"KEEPING THE FAITH is a fine example of how extra features on a DVD can help change your mind about a film.  When I first saw it, my immediate reaction was total disappointment.  It's not that I thought the film bad, exactly.  It was just that the previews had made it out to be a hilarious romantic comedy, and it wasn't exactly splittin' my sides.
When you look at the deleted scenes and hear the audio commentary, it becomes clear that producer/director Ed Norton wasn't trying to make the film the studio was selling.  It's not that he comes out and says, ""Disney's marketing department screwed me."" But you see through his dialogue with his writer that he made conscious choices away from extremely funny material.  He wasn't trying to make a hilarious movie, just a good story about three friends.
This is particularly evident when viewing the deleted scenes.  Though completely shot and scored, Norton decides to axe what is clearly the funniest orgasm scene since Meg Ryan faked it in a restaurant.  You also see how much of Ben Stiller's naturally funnier self was edited out.  Why?  Norton says, to the audible chagrin of his writer, that it didn't really fit in the movie he was trying to make.
Whether you agree with him on this and other choices, the fact is that if the movie he was trying to make had been marketed, it would've garnered more appreciation.
Still, Norton didn't quite succeed at making a solid romance, either.  It's not the kind of movie you'll watch over and over again.  After the engaging set up, there aren't really any plot twists, much less unexpected outcomes.  It's just another romance set in New York.  Lacking either remarkable comedy or profound insight, the film easily releases you from its grasp once you see it.  Norton has traded the innovative promise of the plot for mere likability.  I think, perhaps, that Norton was trying so hard not to cause religious offense that he winds up seeming almost gun shy of his own subject matter.  Or maybe the sudden rewrite of a huge chunk of the movie days prior to filming is what tripped things up.
What I really think sinks the film, though, is Norton's own character.  He's just not a plausible romantic presence.  At no point do you ever feel like Brian might actually GET Anna, so his entire presence is superflous to the romantic plot.  Worse, the storyline depends on him going beyond being hurt by Anna's inevitable rejection, into the area of absolutely unprofessional conduct.  It just doesn't make any sense what he does in the end, and yet without his action, the story can't advance.
  All this aside, students of film will want to look at the DVD version of this movie, just because it's a great case study of the indirect tension between studio and filmmaker, and, to a lesser extent, between director and writer.  Casual viewers in search of a night of light New York romance would probably do better watching WHEN HARRY MET SALLY again.",977961600,5,2941,4.690058479532164
1268275,4,B00003CXHG,"Edward Norton's performance may not be the bright spot in this film, but it's not bad.  Jenna Elfman and Ben Stiller are very good.

That is one thing that is GREAT about keeping the faith--you see the chemistry between all three characters (Father Brian, Rabbi Jake and Anna Riley) and don't wonder for a second what interests them in eachother.  Yes its predictable and even sappy, but it is also truly charming, well written and funny. You really care about the characters and when you listen to them talk to eachother you feel as if you are really listening to old friends chat.  All three actors are so perfect for their roles and Norton's first timed directing doesn't let us down.  Along with the love triangle part of the story there is some really good discussions about faith, life, and forgivness.

1268278,5,B00003CXHG,"The next time you feel totally hopeless and sad over the endless stream of bad, unfunny comedies and pathetic, unmoving romances I suggest you watch Keeping the Faith. It'll put a smile on your face, a tear in your eye, and hope for the future of movies back in your heart.
In short, this movie is awesome. It is a superb blend of side-splitting laughs, happy ending romance, and good old-fashioned priest-rabbi jokes. The script is probably one of the best things to come out of the romantic comedy genre in a while, and impressively enough is not resigned to basing all of its jokes solely on the priest-rabbi thing. From physical scenes to straight dialogue this movie never stops delivering the good times. But it is not strictly punch line after punch line - amongst all of this humor there is a genuine story of friendship, family, love, humanity and yes! even religion. And, unlike so many movies today, there is actual character development and an ability to become attached to those characters.
Of course, a lot of the attachment you have to the people on the screen is due to the awesome people who portray those characters. Ben Stiller and Edward Norton were the PERFECT picks for the lead roles of rabbi and priest, respectively. They worked together ingeniously, playing off one another in the most amusing and remarkable manner. Jenna Elfman played Anna beautifully, and is so totally adorable and endearing that even if you want to hate her because she is so beautiful, you can't. She's a great comic, and holds her own against Ben Stiller who I personally think is one of the funniest kids around. I'm willing to bet the farm that a good deal of the scenese between any combination of these three was filled with improvisation (such as the scene where Norton drifts into a Dustin-Hoffman-as-Rainman manner of speaking, just for kicks). The three are fabulous together.
My highest suggestion - don't miss this movie. See it, rent it, buy it....whatever. But chances are you haven't seen anything this good in a while, and won't again very soon.",976579200,,2059,4.786516853932584
1268279,5,B00003CXHG,"This was not your typical romantic comedy by any stretch. A priest, a rabbi, and a business woman sounds like the beginning of a bad joke but it actually is the scenario for a wonderful film that explores faith, friendship, love, tradition, and conviction.
The basic premise of the film are three friends: a priest Brian (Norton), his best friend a rabbi, Jake (Ben Stiller) who both fall in love with a childhood friend Anna (Jenna Elfman). The story uses each of these characters to explore various issues. Anna is presented as the workaholic person driven by the need to succeed. She says when we first meet her, ""I work harder than God. If God had hired me, the world would have been finished by Thursday."" Jake is pressured by his Jewish community to find a nice Jewish girl to settle down with. Brian is a devote Catholic whose vow of celibacy is tempted by his love for Anna. Brian and Jakes friendship is tested over their mutual love for the same girl.
While sounding like a complex plot, Norton (who debuts as a director with this film) does an amazing job of telling a story, exploring these issues, making you laugh, and adding a good solid love story to boot.
I was struck by how this film is very representative of an entire generation. It's sort of a romantic Friends episode dealing with the complications that arise when faith conflicts with love and tradition. I think it speaks to a lot of young people who have grown up in various traditions and are then confronted with difficult decisions (and often associated guilt) as they wrestle with how to balance their lives.
What is really important in life? What is the difference between faith and tradition? How do I move from success to significance? Is love more important than a career? What does friendship look like?
These are the questions that the film strives to raise for the viewer. Perhaps the line that best summaries this thread through the film is given by Jake towards the end of the film, in which he says: ""We live in a really complex world. A world in which boundaries and definitions are blurring and bleeding into each other in ways that challenge us not just as Jews, but as human beings.""
The movie is a success based on the likeability of the characters alone. Norton does an amazing job of building the characters and the depth of their relationships very quickly. One scene in particular, at a diner where Brian imitates ""Rainman,"" does a phenomenal job of showing the friendship and chemistry between these three people. This is perhaps Elfman's strongest performance yet on film. She does a great job of portraying the driven business type but with enough charm and sophistication to still keep your interest and affection. Norton and Stiller pull off great performances that give you the sense that they have been life-long friends. You don't come to just know the characters, you come to genuinely like them.
Throughout the movie there a numerous laughs and moments that are too funny. I saw this on DVD and the gag scenes and deleted scenes are not to be missed. I'm surprised they kept some of the deleted scenes out of the movie as I think it could have helped build the characters even further.
All in all, a great movie - one that caught me by surprise. A great date movie and one that any Gen X person in their 20s or 30s should see.",976060800,5,3335,4.616161616161616

1268341,3,B00003CXHG,"Edward Norton, Ben STiller, and Jenna Elfman star in this attempt at a romantic comedy that takes itself a little to seriously.  Considering the topic of Religion that comes up, it's hard for there not to be some seriousness.  The three of them are friends growing up together, and when they are in 8th grade, Anna(elfman) moves away to California.  Jake(Stiller) and Brian(Norton, who is also the director of the film as well) remain close friends that grow up to dedicate themselves to their religion.  Brian is a priest.  Jake, a rabbi.  Then, Anna comes back into their lives. At this point, I knew romance would enter between two of them at some point.  THe chemistry between Stiller and Elfman was great.  The film wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't great by any means.  There was way too much time between the laughs in the film.  In my opinion, I think Ben Stiller is the glue of this film.  If it had been someone else playing his character, I don't think I could've stayed interested in it.  Not only does romance enter, but also the whole religion issue(there has to be some conflict, right)Jake being a jewish Rabbi, being in love with Anna, who isn't jewish. The film does make you think about faith and where our faith lies.  The secondary cast, which includes director Milos Forman, Anne Bancroft, who I thought was perfect as the jewish mother, and Eli Wallach, is a great addition to the film. It really was a cute story, and It has a happy ending.  If you are expecting to laugh all the way through, you may be a little disappointed.

It thrives on the performance of Jenna Elfman who is stunning as Anna, a ruthless business woman who is inseparable from her mobile phone. Ben Stiller is as funny as usual whilst Ed Norton shows us once again his incredible range as an actor. Some of the shots of New York are a joy to behold (particularly at night). Obviously, it won't rank among the greatest films ever but it  has an indelible charm and will appeal to all generations. The extra's on the DVD are quite good, keep an eye on the deleted scene 'Anna and her phone' which is hilarious. Anne Bancroft as Jake's (Ben Stiller) mother plays the role to perfection.

1268344,4,B00003CXHG,"This is a pleasant, good movie that you will enjoy but it is hardly a knockout.  Both Norton and Stiller have done better movies but they are both likable and funny in this romantic comedy triangle over their childhood girl friend.  I've never seen Jenna Elfman before and she's cute as the romantic interest for both men, who just happen to be the hippest religious leaders in town.  Norton is a priest and Stiller is a rabbi and they've been friends since childhood.  This may have been funnier if Norton has been an Episcopalian or a Unitarian, giving him the opportunity to push his character further romantically.  Norton's being a Catholic priest instead puts some real restraints on the role.  Norton did a good directing job. Probably because he spent most of his time directing, his acting job needs only about ten percent of his talent in this light piece.  I prefer him as an actor in films like the much weightier ""Fight Club.""  This is a perfect vehicle for Stiller though and he probably has a long career ahead in playing romantic comedy leads similar to this one.

Thumbs up to Ben Stiller and Edward Norton, who manage to pull off their roles with aplomb, and never falling into the trap of turning a funny scene into a forced gag. The DVD version has the deleted scenes and gag reels - the ""Anna and her cell phone"" reel is worth the purchase price all by itself.....",972432000,,520,4.416666666666667
1268350,4,B00003CXHG,"Much more of a Ben Stiller versus Edward Norton fan, I was pleasantly surprised by this light-hearted comedy that was not only an acting but directing vehicle for Norton.  A drunken priest pours out his heart to a sympathetic barkeep (played by wonderful character actor Brian George of Babu Bat/Seinfeld fame), recalling the series of events that brought him to this sorry state.  The plotline is fairly simple- childhood friends Elfman, Stiller, and Norton form a fast bond, Elfman moves away, and the boys are a duo.  Then their lives take a decidedly righteous turn when they both enter the church and temple as priest and rabbi.  They set about reforming their neighborhood through their ministries, dubbed the ""god squad"" by those in the know.  Before they realize it, years have gone by, and though Norton can't get married, there are no such restraints on a rabbi.  Stiller is set up on a series of failed dates;  the women are inexplicably drawn to fawn over him in a disgusting manner.  Then enter Jenna Elfman, the childhood friend who has grown into glorious womanhood.  The trio renew ties, and both Stiller and Norton feel an attraction to her.  I'm sure you can guess what happens from here- boy priest denies attraction to girl, so girl goes for boy rabbi and secretly starts seeing him.  Girl is a shiksa, which doesn't bode well for boy rabbi because of his mother, played with usual aplomb by Anne Bancroft.  Boy priest decides to throw away priesthood and declare love for girl, but she tells him she's in love with boy rabbi.  Boy priest punches boy rabbi's lights out, and falls from proverbial wagon.  This film is endearing on a very sappy level, if one is disposed to that type of film, which I am.  It's a consummate ""date"" movie.  It moves along at a good clip, has a few good laughs, though the ending tends to get bogged down in working itself out. But all in all, an admirable effort for Norton.",972345600,3,1925,4.650887573964497

1268452,5,B00003CXHG,"This is a movie about a priest named Brian Finn (Edward Norton) and a rabbi named Jake Schram (Ben Stiller) in New York City. They're young, popular, down to earth, and are totally committed to their respective religions. Before that, when they were kids, there was this girl--a totally cool chick just like them, down to earth and decent. The three of them were like peas and carrots together but she had to move away, upsetting at first, but ultimately making Brian and Jake best friends by themselves. They're adults now, and she comes back to NYC to visit for business, and things get VERY interesting. If you've ever had the whole ""is [s]he Jewish?"" dilemna, you'll love this movie. Even if you haven't, this romantic comedy breaks all cliches and tells a most unique story. Ben Stiller and Edward Norton, if you're reading this, keep doing these kinds of movies!

1268453,5,B00003CXHG,"There have been so many romantic comedies produced that it is difficult for a film to break out due to the depth and breadth of the competition.  This is one that does.  This wonderfully funny romantic comedy takes a fresh approach, portraying a romance involving not one, but two men of the cloth.  They are not even of the same cloth as one is a Catholic priest and the other a Jewish rabbi.  The girl of their dreams is also the girl of their youth as the three were best friends in grammar school.  Now, after many years of separation, Anna (Jenna Elfman) returns and both men fall immediately and madly in love with her.
The film is chock full of religious humor and sharp-witted dialogue that keeps you grinning between guffaws.  The romance is syrupy sweet and the actors have such great chemistry that it is easy to believe they have been friends all their lives.  Edward Norton produced, directed and starred in this gem and he shows himself to be adept at spinning a magical yarn with very few flaws.  This was Norton's first directorial effort and it bodes well for his future on the other side of the lens.  His work with the actors was marvelous, and his pacing of the film was excellent.  The film flowed very pleasantly from scene to scene and kept the viewer amused and immersed.  If there is any criticism of the film it is its length.  It dwells a bit too long on the schmaltzy romance and takes to long to wrap it up at the end.  These are minor issues in an otherwise enchanting film.
The entire cast is terrific.  Norton plays Father Brian Finn and is funny and affable in the role.  Rabbi Jacob Schram is played by Ben Stiller, whose comedic star is on the rise.  In this film, he outdoes his wonderful performance in ""There's Something About Mary"" with a character that is just as amusing but more complete, with greater range.  Anne Bancroft is also fantastic as the rabbi's mother.  She has the New York Jewish mother routine down pat, right down to the accent.  A dynamite performance.
The real news in this film though, is Jenna Elfman.  She lights up the screen with her enthusiasm and her charming girl-next-door beauty.  She is dynamic, hilarious, sensitive, sexy and lovable and pretty much steals the show.  After her terrific performance in ""Edtv, she proves once again that she is a talented actor and comedian.  One can only hope that the popularity of this film gives her access to more and better parts.
This fabulous romantic comedy is highly entertaining and enchanting.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is especially funny if you happen to be Catholic or Jewish.  I highly recommend it.",972172800,2,2617,4.574193548387097

I believe that Jenna Elman did an excellent job in this movie I have always been a fan of her show Dharma and Greg, and I hope that I see Jenna Elfman in more movies because she has some great talent.  Ben Stiller what can you say another great comedy.  In the last three years this man has been in such movies as There's Something About Mary (I highly recommend you buy), Mystery Men good comedy and Meet the Parents (Watch this movie in the theatres it is hillarious). Every comedy this man does turns into gold.  Also Edward Norton does a good job in this movie, I am not usually a big fan of his movies such as Fight Club, but I have to say Norton did a good job as the priest.

1268456,5,B00003CXHG,"'Keeping the Faith' is one of the funniest, smartest, warmest comedies of the last several years, and marks a wonderful directorial debut for costar Edward Norton. It works on many levels; as a loving look at relationships, on the common ground Judaism and Catholicism shares in compassion towards people, in embracing love, no matter what obstacles might arise...and it does all this while respecting different religions, which makes this a very unique and special film!
  Norton and Ben Stiller play lifelong friends, who, as children, meet a fabulous, funny girl who they bond with. After she moves away, the two grow up, becoming a priest and a rabbi...then the girl returns, as a successful businesswoman, and the friendship is renewed...until romance enters the picture!
  Each character is unique and likeable; Norton is a sweet, funny klutz, endearing in his awkwardness; Stiller is compassionate and quick-witted, dealing with his Temple's matchmaking efforts with wry humor; Jenna Elfman (who has NEVER been lovelier onscreen) is both wise and vulnerable, and totally believable as a person both guys would fall in love with.
  Major issues are addressed in the film (a Priest's vow of celibacy, interfaith marriages, religious discrimination), and are dealt with and resolved in such a positive, loving manner that you wonder why these issues ever BECOME problems! All this reflects well on Edward Norton, who shows remarkable sensitivity as both a cowriter and director!
  The supporting cast is marvelous; Anne Bancroft is fabulous as Stiller's mother, Eli Wallach and Ron Rifkin, as a rabbi and synagogue leader, respectively, are equally good; director Milos Forman is terrific as Father Havel, Norton's mentor. Two other supporting players should be singled out, as well; Lisa Edelstein has a GREAT slapstick scene with Stiller, as the Jewish 'Date from Hell', and Brian George is hilarious as a ""Sikh/Christian with Jewish inlaws"" bartender that Norton confides in.
  There are a LOT of great one-liners, inspired scenes, and a resolution that is both believable and satisfying. The DVD edition offers even MORE to love; Norton's very funny and wise commentary about the making of the film, deleted scenes, and a VERY funny gag reel are special features you CAN'T find anywhere else!
  This film is a MUST for your collection, a 'feel-good' movie that you can enjoy, again and again! I HIGHLY recommend it!",971827200,56,2423,5.216494845360825

1268459,5,B00003CXHG,"i don't usually go for chick flicks, so i bumbled into this one and i have to say it's one of the best romantic comedies i've ever seen in my life. what gives?
'keeping the faith' had me howling with laughter. i liked this one even better than that wedding movie with hugh grant. absolutely slamming dialog is what kept this one so very good. this movie was as close to perfect as i can imagine something in this genre gets, i was completely sucked in.
it is making me wonder if perhaps this is a type of film that i can actually look forward to enjoying on a regular basis. it had a complete lack of irony that i found very refreshing. it was *real*, which is probably the highest complement i could pay a romantic comedy. the relationship between the two male stars is very true to life - even though movie dialog makes people say in one sentence what it usually takes ten minutes for real guys to say - this was completely believable.
much of the authenticity streams, i imagine, from a level of jewish cultural exposition previously unseen on the big screen. not even my old bud michael benben got quite this deep. the shiksa question is always played for a joke in film, and even though this was lightly done, the weight of stiller's decision worked very well.
of all stiller's work (not that i have been a study) this one makes him shine without the complicated pretense with which i had previously associated him and that short babe, garafolo.",969580800,2,1450,4.454887218045113
1268460,4,B00003CXHG,"I saw this movie because I'm a fan of Edward Norton and I wanted to see his directorial debut.  I left the theater feeling uplifted and I was proud  of Norton's positive and humorous look at life.  I was proud of my  generation, glad that we're not all slacker pessimists like Newsweek wants  us to believe.
Back to the movie: humorous, entertaining portrayal of the  friendship between a rabbi and a priest, and the girl from grade school who  walks back into their lives more than a decade later.  What ensues is a  love triangle and some semi-serious semi-humorous dealing with issues like  religion, family, and love.
Edward Norton's directing is straightforward,  but he coaxes a lot out of the script.  The performances by Norton,  Stiller, and Elfman are great and the product is a warm feel-good romantic  comedy.  I enjoyed this movie more than most other movies I saw this  summer, and would definitely see it again.",969321600,4,926,4.765822784810126
