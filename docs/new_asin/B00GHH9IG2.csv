6075685,5,B00GHH9IG2,"At 60 Hetty decides to account for more than a senior citizen, that role she rejects. She and spouse, Robert, are passionate, in love, sometimes with friction. She catches a needy shoplifter teen, Geoffrey, and the stage is set for these 3 in many an adventure. Series One has 6. Hetty loathes dishonesty and coerces Geoffrey to help solve mysteries of crime. It's not hard, gritty, dark, bloody, but a family-friendly crime mystery series for all ages. Comes with plenty of humor with Lancashire country mystery and scenic views. A Pvt. Eye team as heartwarming as case-successful.

Regulars: Hetty Wainthropp (Patricia Routledge -`Keeping Up Appearances'); Robert (Derek Benfield -loved him in the early days of `Rumpole of the Bailey'); Geoffrey (Dominic Monaghan -`Lord of the Rings'); DCI Adams (John Graham-Davies). Tons of seasoned guest stars.

Closed Captioning for all episodes. Just a few guest stars highlighted below.
1- The Bearded Lady --Wainthropp Detective Agency investigates bag lady's death & first paid case, kidnapping. Guest: Jane Danson (The Grand).
2- Eye Witness --Bird-watching deaf mute sees murder--auto over a cliff--caused by a copper (Ray Ashcroft). Alan Rothwell is another guest.
3- Fingers -Hetty's Tuscany holiday lands a case. A son in a Brit school, kidnapped perhaps by mafia, and body parts being mailed to the terrified parents.
4- Widdershins --Robert's uncle hangs himself in a Readsby home. Hetty looks into the details and fins some creepy Satanic results. Guests: Rebecca Collard (The Grand); Eamon Boland; Gwenllian Davies.
 5- A High Profile
Hetty called to locate Hilda's (Anna Reid -`Last Tango in Halifax', `Upstairs Downstairs') schizophrenic son. Mom is desperate to know if he's OK, a threat for `rational suicide.'
 6- Safe as Houses -Abandoned infant's mother could be a serial arsonist. Geoffrey goes undercover for this case--heels & all--seeking success including a reward. Guest: Jane Lowe -`Housewife 49')

8623129,2,B00GHH9IG2,"I recall watching some episodes of this program in the late 1990's on PBS and had a better opinion then, than I do now.  The main  characters and relationships are charming but the story lines - at least in season 1 - make no sense.  The mysteries of the first three episodes feel unresolved and, frankly, silly.  Ep 1 - Lady kills her neighbor because he is experimenting on her and then goes into hiding and lives as a bag lady, while wealthy nephew keeps mum on her whereabouts for fear his reputation will be sullied; really?  Ep 2 - Masochistic beauty queen who enjoys being roughed up by men because of her abusive childhood, is killed by a cop in an emasculating relationship with an ""older"", wealthy woman.  Murder is witnessed by a deaf-mute whom the cop keeps locked up in his barn, 10 yards away from his family home.  Cop is eventually forced to resign from the force because there is not enough evidence, allegedly, to convict him for the death.  Really? Ep 3 - Italian kid gets caught up in gambling debts in England while going to school to learn to speak English.  His family thinks the mafia has kidnapped him and hires Mrs. Wainthropp to find him.  But no, to raise money to pay off his debts, he has - in fact - been selling his services to an unscrupulous undertaker as a mourner at  funerals (an occupation I think ended in the Middle Ages) only to be murdered and mutilated by said undertaker, who has been selling corneas from his ""client's"" corpses on the black market.  Why did the Italian kid get killed?  I have no idea; but God help me if I will suffer through the episode again to find out.  Though the 90's does not seem that long ago (to me) - this show feels quite dated.  [And as a woman in her mid to late- 50's myselt, I cringe every time 60-year-old Hetty is referred to as ""an old lady.""]",1526342400,,1825,4.3579881656804735
8623130,5,B00GHH9IG2,"I adore Patricia Routledge.  I like her in comedies, but this amateur detective drama is a different side of Routledge. I highly recommend this series.",1524960000,,151,5.04
8623131,3,B00GHH9IG2,"A low budget mystery series that seems more concerned with the feelings of victims and perpetrators than actual justice.  Hetty is a kind of proverbial or stereotypical assertive woman of values who goes about finding the sources of people's troubles.  The series, in retrospect, because I did see it when it first aired here on the local PBS stations in the 90s, seems more aimed at how even when mysteries are solved there is little justice, but that Hetty is there to serve as a kind of matron to put an end to abuse and get to the bottom of matters.

Shot mostly on 16mm, the acting from the principles is passable to good, but some of the supporting cast are a little melodramatic.  A slightly higher budget might have helped the series along, but ultimately the heart of the stories deal with behaviors that are off the beaten path from mainstream society, and how people go to extremes to see satisfaction, or avoid getting into trouble, or otherwise go against the grain of society.

So, make of that what you will.  It can be somewhat entertaining, and as a TV series meant to educate the British public on what might be termed as psychiatric disorders, it accomplishes its goal.  The stories focus on not just disorders, but quirks of behavior that everyday people like you and me, and may get those individuals into trouble.

On that note it's worth a watch, though somewhat dissatisfying in the justice department.

Give it a shot.",1520899200,,1443,4.67193675889328

8623133,2,B00GHH9IG2,"Are you kidding me? This is what the Brits watched in the '90s?

First episode. A company is found to be dumping hazards chemicals. A woman kills a scientist for experimenting on her. Maybe her death was an accident, it's not really clear. But the company pays 1,500 pounds to Hetty and that's and end to it.

Second episode. The ""bad guy"" either kills a woman or assists in her suicide, kidnaps a man and all he gets is being fired from the police force? We end with the kidnapped man being united with his mail order bride from Bangkok who can barely stand a brotherly peck on the cheek from him. All's well that ends well?
Too much for me.",1516233600,,642,4.297520661157025
