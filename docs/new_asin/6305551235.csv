1044388,4,6305551235,"I SAW THIS FILM AT THE WRAP VIEWING ON PARAMOUNT'S HUGE MAIN SCREEN AT PARAMOUNT STUDIOS IN HOLLYWOOD.  I'LL TRY TO BE OBJECTIVE, EVEN THOUGH SOME FRIENDS WERE IN THE PICTURE.  I ALSO WATCHED A FEW NIGHTS OF SHOOTING ON  LOCATION.  I HONESTLY FOUND THE FILM TO BE VERY ENTERTAINING, OFF-BEAT, AND  UNIQUE AMONG VAN DAMME FILMS.  IT'S A SPAGHETTI WESTERN ON MOTORCYCLES,  WITH SOME VERY QUIRKY AND OFF BEAT CHARACTERS WHICH SPICE UP THE PLOT.  AS  AN EXAMPLE, WHEN WE FIRST MEET PAT MORITA, WHO PLAYS A VERY ECCENTRIC  CHARACTER, HE IS SITTING IN A DINER (BUILT IN THE DESERT JUST FOR THE FILM  AS WERE ALL THE BUILDINGS), READING A NEWSPAPER WITH A HEADLINE SOMETHING  ABOUT JAPAN BOMBING PEARL HARBOR!  WHACKY.  OTHER GREAT CHARACTERIZATIONS  ABOUND, BUT I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANY AWAY.  IT'S TYPICAL ""REVENGE  FLICK"" FARE, BUT WITH A VERY WELL DIRECTED, STRONG CAST, WHO GIVE A  NEW TWIST TO THAT OLD THEME.  ENJOY THE CHARACTERS, THE ODD-BALL LINES AND  HUMOR, AND HAVE A GOOD TIME WATCHING A NEW TWIST ON AN OLD THEME.  ORIGINAL  TITLE WAS ""INFERNO,"" SCRAPPED DUE TO LITIGATION.  WENT STRAIGHT  TO VIDEO SO AS NOT TO COMPETE WITH UNIVERSAL SOLDIER II, AND DUE TO  LUCRATIVE VAN DAMME EUROPEAN VIDEO MARKET.  I STRONGLY BELIEVE THE FILM  COULD HAVE SET A NEW TONE FOR JEAN CLAUDE IN THE AMERICAN MARKET, WHERE  HE'S NOT AS HOT AS HE USED TO BE, AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IT DID NOT GET  THEATRICAL RELEASE HERE IN U.S.  UNIVERSAL SOLDIER II DID NOTHING MUCH TO  FURTHER HIS CAUSE OR OPEN UP ANY NEW CHARACTER ANGLES FOR HIS FUTURE, WHERE  AS DESERT HEAT MIGHT HAVE.",940377600,3,1567,4.585454545454546

1044636,4,6305551235,"Desert Heat(released Sept/99) is one of my favourite Van Damme films,not to be missed by his fans. Also known as Inferno,this film has everything going for it from drama to comedy to pathos to high action. The film also sports a solid cast of supporting actors like veterans Ford Rainey(Pops),Bill Irwin(old Eli Hamilton),Pat Morita(Jubal Early),Gabrielle Fitzpatrick(Rhonda)as Van Damme's love interest and the always entertaining Latino actor Danny Trejo(Johnny Sixtoes).
The film opens as Eddie Lomax(Van Damme) has returned to his old haunt,wanting to take the final path;i.e die. He is riding an old mint/49 Indian bike,a present for his old pal Johnny SixToes,a recluse Indian who lives in the area. In the middle of the desert he gets surrounded by members of the Hogan clan who rule the local town,their only adversaries being another local band of punks called the Heathens. The Hogan's shoot Eddie and leave him for dead and take his bike,but Eddie's friend Johnny shows up and nurses him back to health. Johnny knows it is not Eddies time to die and Eddie vows to return Johnnie's present to him. He goes to town and takes out two of the Heathens gang who run a store and stole his gun. He frees their chained up uncle who is indebted to him for killing them. Travelling to the cafe he meets up with the owner Pops and Rhonda,a waitress whom he becomes immediately smitten with. A local by the name of Jubal,who can be seen reading a Dec. 8th,1941 copy of the newspaper(!),approaches Eddie offering his services as a handyman. As the bodies pile up it is Jubal who will be seen ""putting out the trash"" as it were,using lots and lot of saran wrap!
Eddie decides a little ""divide and conquer' wouldn't go amiss so he starts with the Heathens at a local bar. Three more go down and Eddie blows up their bikes. The Heathens think the the Hogans are responsible so they plan and execute a jump on the Hogan clan. The Hogans of course retaliate and raid the Heathens warehouse where a huge firefight breaks out,all aided and abetted by Eddie. It is here the father of the Hogan clan learns of the mess that his sons created in obtaining Eddie's bike and in the ensuing tussle with one of his boys he gets killed. Both sides come to the realization in short order that they have all been set up and they combine to go after Eddie. Johnny Sixtoes however has arrived on the scene and in the ensuing melee' he gets fatally shot. Next day the gangs make a combination raid on Eddie's motel room,but he has it laden with booby traps and a few bite the dust in the explosion. It all comes down to the leader of the Hogan's and Eddie. Eddie has him down and he has emptied his gun clip. As Rhonda and he embrace she sees the Hogan get up with a loaded weapon ready to fire. As she wheels Eddie around to take the fatal shot,another shot rings out and the Hogan goes down for the count. We next see some of the locals all with guns in their hands,taking credit for the shot,or was it shots? The film ends with Rhonda and Eddie cruising the desert flats on Johnnie's Indian bike,as Johnny,in spirit,comes up beside them also on an Indian bike smiling.
Along with the serious moments of the film,the makers drop in a good measure of comedy for our consumption. Pat Morita is a delight as the oriental handyman and Bill Erwin as old Eli Hamilton is great in his bright red long johns. There are also the two owners of the motel,especially the bible thumping Mrs. Howard(Priscilla Pointer) who just drools over Eddie and has more than a passing interest in his love life(you'll have to watch the film to see what I mean).Of course Van Damme doesn't disappoint as far as his famous karate moves go,with plenty of action in that department,along with those famous Muscles from Brussels in fine form.
Technically speaking this film is in a snap case and comes in w/s in its 1:85:1 a/r and full screen. It is a DDD(dread double sided disc),so be weary of scuffing and scratches. The movie is generally in good shape but it could use a good remastering to get rid of some of the graininess. There is also the trailer,some other Van Damme trailers and a little Columbia featurette available on other Van Damme titles called Looking back,moving ahead,which looks at several of his Columbia titles.
All in all a highly recommended Van Damme movie. You'll love the action but the package Van Damme and company deliver as a whole,is well worth the look see.",1318118400,,4440,4.593198992443325
1044637,4,6305551235,"1999 was the year that saw Jean-Claude Van Damme descend from mainstream status into the annals of straight-to-video fare. Instead of sinking into a stupor and letting his pessimism dictate the tone of his low-budget work, the Muscles from Brussels proved himself to be surprisingly versatile and used the medium to explore more varied and interesting action movie concepts than Hollywood tends to allow. Stuff like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Replicant/dp/B00005N5QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Replicant</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Hell/dp/B0000DBJ2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Hell</a>&nbsp;are proof of that, as is ""Desert Heat"", which doesn't feature a particularly out-of-the-ordinary storyline but is nonetheless filled with strong production values, fanciful characters, and a general feeling of liveliness that so few DTV flicks possess.

The story: Eddie Lomax (Van Damme) is a world-weary veteran soldier when, on what he expects to be his last motorcycle ride through the desert, he's beaten and left for dead by a gang of thugs holding a nearby town in tyranny. Nursed back to health by his Native American buddy (Danny Trejo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Machete/dp/B002ZG98C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Machete</a>), Eddie finds a new reason to live in liberating the townsfolk from their oppressors using his military skills and the help of several newfound friends.

The film is a loose remake of the Akira Kurosawa classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yojimbo/dp/B000K0YLZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yojimbo</a>, but also draws parallels to Steven Seagal's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fire-Down-Below/dp/6304707622/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fire Down Below</a>&nbsp;in tone and context. Despite the violence, it's a genuine feel-good movie for showing how good can overcome greed and cruelty if a few good folks are up to ensuring it; and in an era of dingy and convoluted low-budget thrillers, this comes as a welcome breath of fresh air. Van Damme gives a vitalizing performance alongside some likeable costars, like Gabrielle Fitzpatrick (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-The-Movie/dp/B0000A14T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie</a>) as a sympathetic diner waitress and Pat Morita (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Karate-Kid-Collection/dp/B0006OBPTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Karate Kid Collection</a>) as a dandy old man who's extremely eager to work as Eddie's personal pickup man, disposing of all the dead bodies he leaves behind. The supporting cast is surprisingly powerful, with the likes of Danny Trejo, Jaime Pressly (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Name-is-Earl/dp/B000G6BL88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Name is Earl</a>), and Larry Drake (""L.A. Law"") not having huge roles but nevertheless helping to expand the scope of the film's character. Everybody's performance is a little hammy, but in an archetypal and satisfying sort of way.

Director John Avildsen (Oscar recipient for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B0006GAO5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>, disappointingly working under a pseudonym) is definitely one of the biggest names to work on a Van Damme movie, but while he successfully manages to craft a product that's way more coherent and streamlined than the average DTV dreck, there's still a bit of lazy editing in a few minor scenes. Being a genuine morality tale, there's much greater emphasis on storytelling than on action, which is sadly limited to a couple shootouts and only a bit of karate from Van Damme, with the sole standup fight not occurring until the end. There are also a few plain weird plot bits: for example, the first time we're introduced to Danny Trejo's character, he's clearly Eddie's hallucination but later enters the storyline for real (i.e. being acknowledged by other characters); (SPOILER!) later on he's clearly killed, but shows up in the last scene riding a motorcycle. Whether he's a ghost or something of the sort is never explained, and while the mystery sort of fits into the plot, its ambiguity is a bit too much for a tale that's otherwise played straight.

Fans of Van Damme generally have more to celebrate when it comes to their hero's post-theatrical career than those of Seagal or Lundgren, and - again - ""Desert Heat"" is a perfect example of this. It's a strong and well-rounded enough vehicle that it can be used to recruit new fans, and older devotees should be pleased to see the karate man stepping out of his zone of expectation a bit. Buy it without fear and know that it'll likely stand closer to your top ten favorite Van Damme adventures than not.",1289779200,,5048,6.586466165413534
1044638,3,6305551235,"They really loaded up on the movie stars for this one, but it all boils down to a rather silly affair.

[Coyote Moon]

(USA - 1999)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

A disillusioned ex-soldier (Jean-Claude Van Damme) goes to the desert to commit suicide, but instead gets drawn into a small town plagued by thuggish drug runners.

Van Damme's career continued its downward slide with this routine actioner, inspired by YOJIMBO (1961) and bolstered by violent set-pieces and a gallery of eccentric supporting characters (played by Pat Morita, Danny Trejo, Larry Drake and Vincent Schiavelli, amongst others). Tom O'Rourke's screenplay springs few surprises, but director John G. Avildsen (THE KARATE KID) keeps the pot boiling in between scenes of gunfire and hand-to-hand combat, and Van Damme strikes something of a god-like figure in his skintight vest and clinging jeans (it's doubtful he ever looked sexier than he does here). Undiscriminating action fans will lap it up, though it doesn't really amount to very much.",1254960000,,955,5.476190476190476
1044642,4,6305551235,"The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)

1. Who is he? Eddie Lomax, decorated but troubled former soldier who is tired of life, and looking for salvation through a bottle and a pearl-plated pistol
2. Which family member/friend must be avenged?  Make no mistake, this is about revenge...but it's personal this time
3. Does he take his shirt off? This movie has JCVD in the desert.  What do you think?
4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? With the gorgeous Jamie Presley in the cast, I had high hopes.  Instead he sets his eyes on beautiful local waitress Rhonda Reynolds (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick), and also picks up two exotic dancers on the side (at the same time).
5. Is there a tournament? Nope.
6. Is training needed for this tournament? All the training he needs was obtained in the Army.
7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament?  No splits in this one.  I think he was on the bike too long and it hindered his flexibility.
8. Does he punch someone in the balls?  Nope, but he proves that a cowboy boot can drive a man's vas deferens into the small intestine.
9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? Not a series, but there is enough to make it fun.
10. Is his enemy unbeatable?  Just a group of wannabe outlaws, desert renegades with carte blanche over the small town of Inferno, Nevada.
11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance?  He gets beaten and shot, left for dead.  It's up to his Indian friend Johnny Six Toes (Danny Trejo) to help him heal and get on to the revenge.
12. Does he win? Not only does he win, but he finds love and turns a desolate desert town into a booming stop on a UFO sight-seeing tour.

Stuck between a criminal, drug-dealing Hogan family, and a petty dirt-bike gang called the Heathens, the town of Inferno, NM is in anarchy.  When Eddie Lomax wanders upon the town, he soon meets up with those he will soon vanquish.  Along the way he gets help from Six Toes, a handyman named Jubay Early (Pat Morita rehashing his Miyagi role but with a Brit-accent), and a hilarious old codger named Eli Hamilton (the legendary Bill Erwin) - who owns the local gun-shop - to rid the town of vermin.

This is not JCVD's best, but it's solid nonetheless.  It's the typical good-guy beating down bad-guys to save the day.  With a very solid supporting cast, the build-up is brief and sufficient.  In no time at all JCVD is kicking, shooting, punching, and sexing-up the town.  A few genuinely light-hearted, comical moments are present when Morita and Erwin interact with one-another, and Trejo is believable as an Indian, but somewhat underused.  The scenery and special effects are minimal; instead, concentration is on the development of the Lomax mystique and the town's struggles.",1243641600,,2749,4.562118126272912

It sounds like entering BurgerKing and asking for a rack of lamb (and being dissapointed that they do not serve it). For me this movie is attractive enough not so much because of VD character and action (though he is surprisingly funny too) but mostly for the surrounding hilarious characters. Just the elderly Japanese gentleman who gleefully giggles packing yet another body (provided by VD's hero) into cellophane and dumping it into a ravine, would have been enough to enjoy the movie but there are others as well, equally hilarious. I believe it would be the best to approach that movie not as a serious action flick, but rather as a black trash comedy - that everything falls into its proper place.",1121990400,2,800,4.762589928057554

1044719,3,6305551235,"Jean Claude Van Damme had a great run in the late 80's and early to mid 90's,but sad to say I think his generation of film has passed,now the majority of action fans want high priced special effects and a superstitious plot. Van Damme has been criticized for having little or no acting skills. Even though none of his films have ever gotten""two thumbs up"" he has had still to this day very loyal fans like myself who would watch him before stallone or shwarzenegger because he brings incredible charisma to movies and always does his own fight sequences. Now I guess I'll critizise ""Desert Heat"".The storyline is a dissapointing one but the supporting cast is farely well in my mind with Jamie Presley. The overall action is alright, but typical Van Damme,nothing that you haven't seen from him before. The acting performance which I look at since some say he can't act is alright in this movie. I think the character doesn't fit Van Damme because he usually deals with more dangerous villians,in this movie he deals with a bunch of low life rednecks.

Eddie Lomax{Van Damme} tries to escape the horrors he faced in the war, in the form of nightmares, by riding out into the desert to end his life and is also trying to deliver a gift to an old war buddy who he saved in the war. The action heats up when his gift is stolen and thus frees a small town from two rival gangs using war games and acting like a one man army. Even near the end a character asks a person out to a movie called Yojimbo as kind of a humorous hint as to what the movie was based on. An action packed movie with comedy, a touch of romance, and a bit of Native American lore, Desert Heat is an awesome flick for any fan of action, comedy, and/or Jean-Claude Van Damme.",1023753600,5,840,4.159509202453988

A funny Indian man (Danny Trejo) helps Van Damme get revenge on the hillbillies that stole his motorcycle. While recovering, the funny Indian man compares Van Damme's genitals to the size of a coyote's. It was a hilarious moment. When Van Damme is fully recovered, he makes his way to town to get his bike back, but he runs into old people, prostitutes and Mr. Miyagi (yes, Daniel-san's master, pure genius). Of course this movie was made by a genius who also showed Van Damme's true acting and his taste for a good pie.

The fight scenes are pretty nice, and the character development is better then in most Van Damme movies. You actually begin to care about the characters! The plot isn't bad, either. A good DVD. Like I said, other movies such as Hard Target are better, but Desert Heat is still very much worth it.",1018051200,,394,4.337837837837838

Wow was a suprized this movie has to be up there with Van Dammes best movies aka cyborg, double impact, univeral soldier 1. This movie actually has a great plot usually the plots could use some work but this is much better than before. And also this movie isn't just circled around action theres more acting than action which makes a good movie because fighting on every change of the scene is pointless aka univeral solider the return. And theres romantic scenes in this also. All in all this is Van Damme at his best. After years hes finnaly back on top with this movie.

1044799,1,6305551235,"This movie tried hard to be more than a genre martial arts movie, but the screenplay was too weak.  The women characters, one and all, fell for Van Damme like coconuts from a tree.  The villains were so dumb that Van Damme  nearly succeeded in getting them to kill themselves off halfway through the  movie.  Given the weak plot I kept expecting decent fight scenes to liven  things up, but there were none.  I repeat, there were no good fight scenes,  and this is an action movie!  None of the villains had martial arts skills  to speak of, so watching Van Damme fight them was like watching a man beat  a dog with a tire iron.
As for Van Damme's so-called acting, his  character, Eddie Lomax, lacked credible motivation.  Lomax was supposed to  be suicidal but Van Damme just couldn't sell it.  Lomax was a physical  specimen, with women falling at his feet. He moved and fought like a  commando, and had Mystical Indian Powers.  And yet he couldn't think of a  single reason to go on living?  After watching him wallow in self-pity in  the desert I wanted to shoot him myself.  After Lomax takes the beating,  heals and heads out for revenge, he kills the villains so dispassionately  that you'd think he'd beaten them out of their beer money instead of  snuffed out their lives.
I am a Van Damme fan.  I paid $4 to rescue this  movie from the bargain bin.  I regret to say that I paid too much.  Well,  maybe not; I can reuse the tape.",961113600,10,1439,4.402298850574713

What makes it weird is the way one  minute you know you're watching an action flick then it seems to get  dramatic then turns into a comedy.  If your the type of person who feels  comedy in action films don't go then don't buy this.

This is a comedy-action film with an all-star ""B"" cast and music by Oscar winner Bill Conti. Eddie Lomax is delivering an Old Indian motorcycle to ""old Indian"" Danny Trejo (His joke, not mine). He stops in the middle of the desert and further dehydrates with some alcohol which leads to some bullies to take his bike and leave him for dead. Trejo nurses him back to health and Eddie (Jean-Claude Van Damme) vows revenge to get the bike back, save the terrorized town, and break up the biker/meth dealers....and stop the aliens...shhhh!

I loved the humor of the film with roles by Pat Morita, Jaime Pressly, Ford Rainey, Priscilla Pointer, and Vincent Schiavelli (you'll know him when you see him.)  Van Damme does the worst Rodney King impersonation with his, ""Can't we all get along"" line. The film also had corny lines written by adolescents like, ""I really want to thank you"" where we all will her to drop the towel.

The film was badly anachronistic. Pat Morita is reading a newspaper dating from WWII while modern jets fly overhead and girls wear tank tops and jeans. The implication of the film was this incident is what caused the ""Area 51"" UFO craze. In reality we know Agent Jean-Claude Van Damme Johnson was working undercover on assignment and in his free time was at said area, most likely saving the planet from aliens all the while he is making this film.
