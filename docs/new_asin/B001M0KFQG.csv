3692009,4,B001M0KFQG,"We rented this movie so many time from the library, that I figured I better buy it.  I gave it 4 stars becuase for he money I would reccomend spending a few more buck and but the I love toy train 5-pack DVD set...WAYYYYY more for your money!  But this is a great movie for $10.",1322438400,,277,3.9285714285714284
3692010,1,B001M0KFQG,"I was really disappointed with this DVD.The fires and the Halloween scenes were too much for my 3-year-old grandson. I threw it out, since I wouldn't want any other child to have it either. If you want a really good train DVD, get THE ALPHABET TRAIN ( Beautifully filmed and educational as well.) I am a child development professor, and have recommended THE ALPHABET TRAIN to several day care centers as well as friends. Another good one is I LOVE TOY TRAINS 4-5-6-. Amazon sells both.",1273104000,,485,4.651162790697675
3692011,5,B001M0KFQG,"My grandson has ALL the train DVDs and this is his absolute favorite!  Not annoying a bit, I actually enjoy sitting with him watching it.  Songs are catchy and he sings them all day long (and I in my head the day through!).  Highly recommended",1272585600,5,243,4.355555555555555

Unlike some of the other ones that have hokey narrators or kids talking, this one features lots of non-stop action from all gauges of model railroads and great sing-a-long songs from award-winning musician James Coffey.  This Toy Train DVD makes a great gift for young and old alike.  There's also Real Steam and Diesel Trains that are part of the Lots and Lots of series that feature music and non-stop action.  If you have a child that's 3 years old or older or a child with autism, these dvds are guaranteed to become their most popular.[...] Just search for Lots and Lots of in the DVD category to see all the programs in the award-winning series!",1257811200,10,1103,6.476190476190476
3692013,4,B001M0KFQG,"Totally love this DVD.  My son loves all things trains and loves to see model toy trains over and over.  The music is ok.  Love the bonus features of big steam locomotives.

I do think the Halloween Train is a bit too gruesome with heads, bones, and dismembered fingers.  I skip this song when it's playing.",1382745600,,307,4.410714285714286

3692016,4,B001M0KFQG,Very entertaining little DVD showing model trains moving busily about backyards and model villages. Would have liked more Lego setups but on the whole I enjoyed this DVD.,1376092800,,170,5.107142857142857

3692019,4,B001M0KFQG,This was the first DVD my son opened and he played it 4 or 5 times on X-mas day.  His only complaint was their wasn't enough diesel or steam trains.  If you know trains you will know what he means.,1358553600,,197,3.9

3692021,5,B001M0KFQG,"My 3 year old is obsessed with trains, and he will sit and watch this DVD from the beginning to the end. And even after the end, he loves to watch the ""Steam Jonas"" (it is called ""Steam Bonus"" and it's just footage of real steam trains). I like to watch it too! There's some nice music with it that's very catchy and kind of fun to dance around and be silly to. Highly recommended. We'll probably buy the part 2.",1351987200,,412,4.098765432098766
3692022,5,B001M0KFQG,"I actually haven't received the Amazon order yet, but I was ordering this as a replacement.  This is my toddler's favorite dvd but unfortunately our old one was crushed during our vacation last week.  He's been clamoring to see ""TRAINS!!"" so I had to order quickly. Can't wait for it to get here, so I hope Amazon Prime works fast :-).",1338336000,2,335,4.475409836065574

8320234,1,B001M0KFQG,We ordered a copy of this and it ended up being blank. Amazon sent us a second copy and it was blank as well.  Very disappointing to our 4 year old who was looking forward to watching it. This also happened to us a year or so ago when we ordered Lots and Lots of trains. We own two working DVD's from this company and my son loves them. I think we are done trying to order them though.,1478563200,,385,3.8734177215189876
