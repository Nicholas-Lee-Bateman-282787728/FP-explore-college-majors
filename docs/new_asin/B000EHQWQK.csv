8109871,5,B000EHQWQK,"I bought my first Mei Mei DVD when my daughter was 3 yrs old.  I now have two daughters(both adopted from China) and they both learned so much from the DVD. The music and dancing caught their interest and facilitated their learning.  For the last three years, they have been happily singing and dancing with Mei Mei's DVDs.  I highly recommend them!",1302566400,,349,4.596774193548387

As they enter into the building each children is greeted by the school doctor who squirts medicine in the children's mouth to keep them all healthy.  Next is group excercises outside and then the chidlren greet their teacher as they walk into class.  Next is a traditional breakfast of steamed bread, porridge and milk. You get to see inside of a classroom, some older children's artwork and then follow the children for the rest of the day learning, singing, playing at recess, lunch of white rice and tomatoes and then some fresh fruit followed by nap time. Then there is a dance recital.

Other than the children's artwork the learn & repeat part to learn Chinese goes very fast.  Each starts out with a little skit which is done with Mei- Mei & a group of 4 girls. Mei- Mei says a sentence in English and 4 girls answer in Chinese. Then it is repeated again all in Chinese with English & Pinyan at the bottom of the screen. It is done very fast and not as slow as it has been done in the other dvd we have which is Dance & learn. Since we don't have  dvd's 1 -4 yet maybe the dvd's progress in the speed of which you learn to speak Chinese, I don't know, it just seems very fast even for me.

For our family this is an excellent was to show your our daughter what Kindergarten is like in China. We talk about how things are the same as here in the United States and how they are different from China. For example Chinese Children in this dvd take naps in beds when our daughter's class sleeps on cots or blankets. My daughter enjoyed watching the dvd and asked many questions and loved seeing other Chinese children. maybe through watching this dvd over and over again she will pick up some Chinese, just not as quickly as in the other dvd.",1200873600,4,1846,4.333333333333333
8109875,5,B000EHQWQK,"I think we have all the Mei Mei dvd's, and the kids loves all of them.  I think these dvd's are fantastic!!

There is also a Mei Mei cd with her songs on them. We downloaded the songs onto the kids music player, and they can now listen to it whenever they want. The songs are very catchy.

I cannot say enough good things about the Mei Mei series! My kids have definitely learned some Chinese from them.

Also, the Follow Jade dvd's are great. There are two, one going to Kindergarten, and one going to the market. Only thing is that she teaches you the name of the fruits, but doesn't teach you how to ask for it in a sentence. Hope she expands on that with more dvd's.

Plus, we also bought this gorgerous ""ASIAN AMERICAN BERENGUER GIRL DOLL"" from EBAY, and my daughter absolutely loves to play with the beautiful doll and watch her Chinese dvd's.

Highly recommend.",1174780800,,868,4.3602484472049685
8109876,5,B000EHQWQK,I got this for my 4 year old and was quite pleased.  They show what a typical day is like for young Chinese students.  Very interesting!  My daughter loves all of Mei Mei's DVDs!,1167782400,2,178,4.176470588235294
