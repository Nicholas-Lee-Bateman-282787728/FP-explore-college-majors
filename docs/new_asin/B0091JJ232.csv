5242019,5,B0091JJ232,I purchased this movie for my niece for christmas and she absolutely loves it.  The values that are taught through all the Tails of Abbygail movies are great and important for children to learn and what better way then through these movies.  Our niece loves the different characters in the movies and watches it over and over.  I will continue to purchase these movies as gifts.,1371600000,,378,4.696969696969697
5242020,5,B0091JJ232,"My son was lucky enough to meet many of the stars of The Tails of Abbygail series, since that day 2 years ago he has been madly in love with the shows!  Many of our friends and family's children love this movie - it is educational, tells great stories that keeps the attention of kids and is a fresh change of scenery from normal younger kid shows and cartoons!  It is filmed outside and enourages little ones to find adventures wherever they are, all while remembering safety!",1371600000,,477,4.471264367816092
5242021,5,B0091JJ232,"My daughter has been an Abby-fan since the first installment of this series.  She loves the songs, the animals and the sweet, simple narrated stories that have wholesome lessons about love, kindness, and friendship.
If you are expecting a slick Hollywood show with lots of CGI and emphasis on production values like wide screen viewing options(complaint of a 2 star reviewer); then no, this isn't the dvd for you.
But, if you are looking for a cute, entertaining and relatable story with good values and adorable animals acting naturally in a real outdoor setting..look no further.  With original music that will keep your child singing long after the show is over, The Tails of Abbygail: Adventures of Pookie Lu will warm your heart and make you smile.  Your child will be watching it again and again!",1371600000,,802,4.882352941176471
5242022,5,B0091JJ232,"Great storyline, my kids love this series I think the use of animals helps the kids absorb the message!  Great to see a kids movie out in nature and being from the Pacific Northwest myself its just awesome!!  Highly recommend",1371600000,2,225,4.6
5242023,5,B0091JJ232,"I found this DVD entertaining, educational, fun, and super cute. I instantly fell in love with all the characters and the story line/adventures they embark upon. I myself do not have children, but am a HUGE dog lover, and I found this DVD to be very entertaining and fun to watch and sing along with. Abbygail, Pookie Lu Little, Church the Town Mayor, and others, all touched my heart and made me smile.  I would highly recommend The Tails Of Abbygail series to all parents with young children.",1371600000,3,494,4.613636363636363
5242024,5,B0091JJ232,"My second and 3rd grade boys LOVE All of the Tails Of Abbygail DVD's. The Adventures Of Pookie Lu is another great addition to our ""Tails"" collection. The stories are so sweet and have wonderful messages for children of all ages. Can't wait for the next one!",1371600000,3,258,4.51063829787234
5242025,5,B0091JJ232,"Wonderful video for kids of all ages.  My girls, 5 & 7 LOVE all the Tails of Abbygail and I think the Adventures of Pookie Lu Little and More may just be their very favorite yet!!  They watch this video over and over and just love the cute catchy songs.  Pookie Lu, Shorty Pants and Abbey Little have become favorite characters in our house and they have even used their stuffed animals to act out new adventures with these characters in the leading roles.  Great video for the little animal lovers in your life and a great message toward adopting a new family member!!  As a parent I love the innocence of these stories and I know that when I pop in a new Tails of Abbygail I don't have to worry about what my kids are being exposed to.  I can't wait to see what they come up with next!!",1371600000,3,788,4.185430463576159
5242026,5,B0091JJ232,"This is a wonderful movie....Pookie Lu chapters are amazing!!  My daughter is 18 and has Down Syndrome.  She loves the stories and owns the whole set of Tails of Abbygail, inlcluding Pookie Lu Little and more....  My daughter's IQ and articulation is very limited even as low as a 3 year old, but these movies make sense to her and she thoroughly enjoys watching them...they are at her level - there are not many movies out on the market with live animals that cater to her level of understanding.

As i mentioned earlier we have the whole set, and we will continue to purchase each one that comes out on sale!!!

Thank you, you really made my daughter one very happy lady.....

5242027,2,B0091JJ232,"If you see this dvd, just say no!  I was expecting a cute story for my young grandkids, not someone just reading a story with video of dogs in the background.  Plus it's not even widescreen and even with that, a lot of the video is on only a partial pseudo video screen.  Disappointed...",1368057600,,287,4.277777777777778
5242028,5,B0091JJ232,My toddler daughter was lucky enough to be able to see a pre-screening of this at her day care (It is now all I and the daycare provider hear about!) They were all mesmerized by the cute story and couldn't take their eyes off the screen. My daughter tells me stories about all of Pookie Lu's adventures and knows every character! Shorty Pants is her favorite! The characters all go on fun adventures and make great role models for the children. All the music is cute and the story line is adorable! We now know the perfect gift for all of our friends kids!!!,1349136000,6,558,4.375

8534221,5,B0091JJ232,"My children LOVE Abbygail and her friends. The whole series is very fun and exciting with a great message that kids will remember and music the children will love and sing along with. My kids have almost worn out their copies watching them so many times. The lessons that are taught to our children through these adorable videos are so important. The animals are so cute the way they all interact with each other, the whole crew not just the puppies, it is truely fantastic! I can't wait to get the newest episodes and we are all looking forward to seeing more! Well done Tails of Abbygail, keep up the good work!",1372636800,,613,4.482142857142857
8534222,5,B0091JJ232,Several months ago my Granddaughter was given a wonder video called The Tails of Abbygail! and little by little she has gotten all of them and absolutely loves them! she knows all the animals names as if they are her friends and we talks about the lessons (morals) that are taught in the shows like stranger danger and staying away from strange animals. I love how the story's are told and how much she relates so well to them. Terri Linn Link did an amazing job on all her shows The Adventures of Pookie Lu is right up there! I have recommended this series to many of my friends and family as a prefect set for small children. In a world when we have to worry about what our kids are watching on TV the Tails of Abbygail and all her wonderful friend are a no brainier! Get Them and save them for the next generation!,1371686400,,817,4.243589743589744
8534223,5,B0091JJ232,"I teach students in kindergarten through second grade. I have used the Tails of Abbygail series in my classroom as a reward as well as a teaching tool in writing workshop. We analyze the characters, the plots, create new plots as well as settings. My children love writing their own 'adventures' with Abbygail and the other characters. My students are in LOVE with this series and request watching the videoes over and over. Thank you Tails of Abbygail for providing these heart warming adventures!",1371686400,,498,4.940476190476191
8534224,5,B0091JJ232,"I stumbled upon this cute show about a curious dog...a little Jack Russell Terrier named Abbygail, when it piloted on CBS, and then saw it again flipping thru channels on TBN (Trinity Broadcast Network).
I then googled ""Abbygail"" and read thru pages and pages of great reviews and also the story of how the writer/producer came up with the idea of Abbygail in the first place.
I fell in love!
The Tails of Abbygail is a precious storytelling series (long lost these days) where the animals act as ""role models"" for children...Brilliant!
I then introduced Abbygail and her friends to my family.
My granddaughter and her friends love Abbygail's Adventures... and so do I! (Our dogs love watching it too) LOL
I'm a grandmother that cares what my granddaughter watches...and I approve and recommend The Tails of Abbygail!
You won't be disappointed...this title earns 5 stars from our family! Good job, Abbygail!
We can't wait for more adventures!  P.S. we would love to see some Abbygail books...(hint, hint) ;-)",1371600000,,1008,4.964497041420119
8534225,5,B0091JJ232,The Abbygail series is the BEST!!!  My nine year-old and seven year-old both love them all!  All the stories are heartwarming and present good lessons for children.,1371600000,2,164,5.037037037037037
8534226,5,B0091JJ232,"I bought this video for my nephew and he is just enamored with all the animals and the excitement of the narrator!  The story line is so creative and keeps his attention....even after the 100th time.  And yes he can quote the lines in the movie....over and over again!  :)  Such a unique and innovative way to incorporate real animals into picture!  Your kids, grandkids, nieces, nephews....any kids will absolutely fall in love with this movie!  Pookie Lu is a true movie STAR!  LOVE her!",1371600000,2,489,4.682352941176471
8534227,5,B0091JJ232,"My daughter has been watching these movies since she was 4. They were love at first sight. Cute stories, love able  characters and heartfelt messages of safety and friendship. My daughter is about to turn 9 and still loves the series! I highly recommend this show. Your children will not be disappointed. I was sad to see the bad review...it's a shame! This series is fantastic!",1371600000,,378,4.7272727272727275
8534228,5,B0091JJ232,"My youngest was just a toddler when they were mesmerized by the world premiere of The Tales of Abbygail.  My children loved each movie more and more, and couldn't wait to get the dvd in the player when they saw that we had The Tails of Pookie Lu sitting on our table.  Since, they have watched it dozens of times, and often times.  I'm also a Prek teacher, and when my class earns a movie day, Pookie Lu is one of the the top choices, and often leaves mega box office movies in the dust when the final vote is taken.  It's not uncommon to come into my classroom or my home and hear one of the songs being sung by a little voice as they play with their little plastic puppies.

Terri Lynn Link, the creator and also narrator of The Tails of Abbygail movies has been the voice my children have fallen to sleep to for many years, and will be for many more to come.  This family friendly series of movies has been a blessing to our little circle in the world and given our kiddos a healthy innocent choice when they get screen time.

I recommend this movie to everyone I know, and I'm proud to have a classroom that supports The Tails of Abbygail!!",1371600000,2,1144,4.19634703196347
