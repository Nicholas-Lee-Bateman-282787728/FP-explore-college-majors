2780440,4,B0001CKWRI,"In 1963, William E. Barrett's ""mini"" novel of the power of faith, LILIES OF THE FIELD, about an itinerant black handyman, a community of German nuns and the chapel which the handymanm manages to build for them almost out of thin air was adapted into what can only be described as a classic film starring Sidney Poitier as the handyman ""Homer Smith"" and Lilia Skala as ""Mother Maria"", the formidable Mother Superior of the community who (I have to say this with a smile) cons Smith into building the chapel.  Sixteen years later in 1979, the story is continued in CHRISTMAS LILIES OF THE FIELD, with Billy Dee Williams taking over from Poitier as ""Homer Smith"" and Maria Schell assuming the role of ""Mother Maria"".  While this is a made-for-TV movie, it still captures the spirit of its ""parent"" film as Smith returns after a number of years to the chapel he built only to get ""conned"" into another job by Mother Maria on the grounds that he hadn't finished the previous job! (The bell tower of the chapel has no bells.)  Also, things have changed in the nuns' community with the addition of a group of orphans that the nuns are caring for, and Smith and Mother Maria begin another round in this enduring tale of hope and faith.  While Williams is no Poitier, he brings his own charm, humor and ""take"" to the part, while Schell is indeed as formidable as Skala (but a touch more devious and less cantankerous than Ms. Skala's ""Mother Maria"" in her dealings with Smith; plus the English of Ms. Schell's ""Mother Maria"" is better) and totally believable in her role. This film itself, as a reviewer in the IMDB website writes, in its ""low-key, matter-of-fact atmosphere makes for a realistic portrayal of everyday struggles. No supernatural miracles here - just a bunch of people trying to better the lives of unwanted kids ... the southwest location is a nice change from the stereotypical snowy Christmas-movie locations.""  Another major point in this TV movie's favor is that its director is Ralph Nelson, who directed the original LILIES OF THE FIELD and who doesn't seem to have lost his touch in continuing the story. One thing that does and will cause unfavorable comparison with the original film is that CHRISTMAS LILIES OF THE FIELD is shot in color; the original black-and-white of the Poitier film gave it an indefinable quality, but then what works on the big screen doesn't always work for the smaller TV screen.

All in all, the sequel may not be as powerful as the original film, but it stands on its own merits.  I wouldn't call it the Number One pick for a Christmas movie, but it continues the message that with faith and hope anything is possible ... even miracles of the small, everyday sort!  And isn't tnat what Christmas or indeed everyday life is all about?",1135468800,9,2778,4.67827868852459

So theres this film called Lilies Of The Field you may have heard of. It wasn't a very big deal, except for the fact that it explored old themes of pride and isolation with a fresh story-telling innovation, wrapped in a plot that for a drama is all but enthralling, adapted from a novel of the rarest literary value written about a legendary but [purportedly] true story... and oh, its star won an Academy Award, and that star just happened to be Sidney Poitier, the first African American ever to take home the prestigious Best Actor award for his leading role, and all this happened while Dr. Martin Luther King was alive and fighting tooth and nail for black rights.

So yeah, its kind of a big deal. Lilies of the Field broke ground on every aspect and facet.

And then theres Christmas Lilies Of The Field, its made-for-TV Christmas special sequel.

Im not saying that it couldn't be done. That it was impossible to craft a followup which would ever be anything more than an amazing films sorta-dumb tagalong little-brother.

But as moving and groundbreaking a film and story as the original was, they probably shouldnt have tried.

If you haven't seen the original, stop. Stop right now. Abandon ship. Go and watch the original Lilies, STAT, before I call you uncultured swine. I try not to reveal any more than the inciting event in any review, but considering this ones a sequel, I cant be held responsible for spoiling anything in the original.

If you read any further, and I happen to ruin an American classic that youve never seen before, thats on you, buddy.

The OG Lilies introduces Homer Smith, a vagrant laborer who dreams of becoming an architect. Its a tale of a self-generating destiny overtaking the man. In the middle of the desert he encounters a group of German nuns who, we learn in due time, have hurdled monstrous adversity to escape Soviet-controlled parts of Europe and immigrate to Arizona, where they manage a meager living pulling the proverbial water from the rock and farming the barren desert. Smith stops to help them mend a fence on the hopes hell be paid, only to meet his match in the iron-willed Mother Superior: they quote a few scriptures, Smiths scripture hinting that he ought to be paid and Mother Superiors suggesting the opposite. Mother Superior gets the upper hand and manages to convince Smith to stay on for another odd-job the next day.

Thus shanghaied, Smith finds himself all but obligated to continue his work helping the nuns. They continue to not pay him, and its a case of worlds colliding when Smith (a Baptist) is immersed in their Catholic world, but an undeniable bond is building. Smiths growing friendship with the nuns culminates in admitting his dream of being an architect and agreeing to construct a chapel so that they and their parishioners don't have to walk miles to the next towns chapel, and despite Smiths obstinate insistence that he alone build it, the nuns and community band together to assist in the mammoth project. Eventually  here comes in the self-generating destiny  they come to believe Smith was sent by God on a mission to help them.

Well, hey, Id find it hard to argue with a bunch of nice nuns too. What are you going to do; tell them Screw you, God didn't send me, Im out?

The bittersweet ending revolves around these two indomitable wills, Mother Superior and Smith, whove butted heads throughout the film. Smith completes the chapel, and Mother Superior finally gives thanks to him directly (whereas before shes been careful to thank only God). They and the nuns sing one last Baptist riff together, and Smith quietly departs onto fates unknown, supposedly forever. Mother Superior, knowing hes leaving, makes no further efforts to twist his arm or dominate his choice with any quoted scripture.

Youre satisfied with this ending. It isn't 100% happily-ever-after, but its good enough. After a long struggle these two have finally come to understand each other.

Which brings me at last to why this sequel should not have been made: its a freaking Christmas special.

Lando Calrissian/Apollo Creed (known as Billy Dee Williams to some people) takes over the leading role in Christmas Lilies Of The Field, and I have no complaints there. Hes a versatile enough actor to work with what hes given. But let me give you the (somewhat mocking) rundown of exactly what they gave him to work with.

Homer Smith is back! Hes been reunited with the nuns after coming to reinspect his work on the chapel and ensure its still up to spec. But wait; whats this?

A busload of adorable children? Not just children- orphans. Thanks for the chapel, Lando, but we need an orphanage now, and its got to be done before Christmas or the Big Bad State is going to send them all to foster homes.

Oh, and one of the orphans is pregnant. Will the baby be born healthy, and on Christmas Eve? I have a feeling I know the answer to that!

Basically, its a But-The-Children! plot, and its totally lame.

OG Lilies is a like a five-course meal engineered by a nutritional scientist. Its everything you want out of this sort of drama. Its the porterhouse steak; its the salad; its expert wine-pairings; its a delicious desert you don't feel guilty about.

Christmas Lilies? Christmas Lilies demands a happily-ever-after by its very nature. Christmas Lilies is rock-candy dipped in chocolate, drizzled with caramel, and liberally coated with sugar.

I enjoyed the movie for what it was. I had no delusions going into it. This was a light-hearted sequel which never aimed to break new ground.

But after OG Lilies, that just wasn't enough. OG Lilies deserves better.

My message to filmmakers? If a sequel cant at least match its original, don't bother.

My message to viewers? If you're the kind of person who likes Christmas Specials, have at it. If you're here for that same fulfillment you found in OG Lilies, though, you're barking up the wrong tree.",1473120000,3,5950,4.7636186770428015

Poorly cast and an embarrassingly bad script combine to make this head up the list of films not to see for Christmas (or any other time). The shame of it is that this could have been a good film, with far better screen writing and casting. This is nothing but a made for TV, low budget attempt to squeeze another nickel out of the success of the excellent 1963 original.",1414972800,,481,4.2967032967032965
