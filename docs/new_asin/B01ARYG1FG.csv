8748086,2,B01ARYG1FG,"Four brothers are known vigilantes. They leave a photo at the scene and post pictures on line. A police chief asks them to go after a crime boss because the cops are dishonest. The brothers are over-the-top in their antics and leave a trail of blood behind them. BTW they have 24 hours to capture (and not kill) the crime boss or the devices in their chest will kill them.

Yes there is lots of killing, with much of it being idiotic. The film is done in a campy grindhouse style, bad by design. The humor comes from the banter between the three brothers (one doesn't talk) who actually have good comic delivery and timing. Unfortunately the lines were not that funny. Jesse-Lee Lafferty and Reeping know how to tell jokes, but not write them. Mildly amusing and entertaining.

8748088,2,B01ARYG1FG,"Stupid. Cheaply made. I thought at near  the end this might be Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, without the masks or the half-shell, but then that would mean they were half smart. It was a brother duo who made a ""movie?"" while either drunk or stoned. The ending kept it from being a 1 rating. The shooting scenes were like they were stuck in a video game or hologram deck.",1463616000,,369,4.3478260869565215
