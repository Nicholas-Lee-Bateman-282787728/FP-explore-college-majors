Unless it's the OLD lady doo!  These girls All looked like Diseal dykes with those short sheena Easton hair cuts. The best part of te whose concert was with Belinda Carlie wearing all of that pink. And eventually kicking off her heels and strutting around on the stage Barefoot...The song Vacation was the only one that even remotely sounded like the original radio version!  But I do have to give the girls credit about one thang. They do know how to rock,and play their musical insturments considering that they we're early 80s new wave Bubble Gumers!!",1447804800,,732,4.7109375

Wish they'd put this on DVD!",1345420800,,131,4.28
7816899,5,6301901134,The VHS tape box was worn but the video was excellent.  The performance of the Go-Go's was classic.  Their music was upbeat and a feel-good experience.,1334016000,2,151,4.769230769230769
7816900,4,6301901134,"This is a great dvd. It was a home video release back in 1984. The tracks are Head Over Heels, Our Lips Are Sealed, Forget That Day, We Got The Beat, Turn To You, Tonight, You Thought, Yes Or No, I'm With You, This Town, Can't Stop The World, Vacation, and I'm The Only One. The only down side to this dvd is that, it is a Japanese format. I couldn't play in my dvd player, but could on my computer dvd drive. I had to change the format on my computer under different countries, and regions.",1213833600,5,491,4.072164948453608
7816901,5,6301901134,"This video is pure vintage Go-Go's.  Filmed at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles in 1984, it is a great time capsule look at the life and times of the early 1980's and the Go-Go's on their way to a nasty break up.  The girls look like they just don't like each other any more and are just doing their thing to make it work...
A must have for any real Go-Go's fan collection.
Watch it and relive the 1980's all over again.",1074643200,6,420,4.048192771084337
