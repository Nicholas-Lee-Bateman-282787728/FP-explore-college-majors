915131,3,6304603754,"The cover of this movie naturally caught my eye in the video store, as I'm sure it did the eye of every straight male in this country, but for the most part I'd say the cover is misleading. Monica Keena is gorgeous in this, don't get me wrong, but there's not a lot of eyecandy in this or anything. I can really only recall one arousing scene where she's alone in a shed. As for the rest of the film, I'm not to keen on militairy stuff, and the other sister was so...well, the type of girl I really can't stand. I rather wished this movie would have had a happy ending, with the biker dude and Keena running off together and getting married, leaving the sister to enjoy her continued gender bending existence. All I can say is watch it once, you might like it. And if you think Keena is a hottie check out Snow White, A Tale of Terror. She is the perfect Snow White! It'd be nice if she also made a family version too, she's just so perfect for the role.",983404800,40,954,4.134408602150538
915132,1,6304603754,"This movie is an utter disappointment. The concept it explores - budding female sexuality in a hyper-testoterone environment - is certainly fascinating and well worth exploring, but the realization of that concept falls apart in nearly every way. The script is very badly written, both in terms of storyline, and of dialogue. One can't help feeling, for example, that the screenwriter wrote swearwords into the opening monologue simply to have the speaker swear. The story relies so heavily on cliche that you can predict each plot twist twenty minutes in advance. The army base, where most of the film takes place, is in a state of disrepair that the army would never have allowed - the set dressers couldn't even get rid of the cobwebs. The supporting actors are laughably bad, from the ""lone biker"" guy who deflowers one sister, to the ""sympathetic officer"" who teaches the other to shoot a gun, to the various soldiers and cadets milling about the outskirts of the plot. In fact, this movie is so bad over all, it might be enjoyable to watch simply to make fun of it. Except no, the two starring actresses, Daisy Eagan and Monica Keena, are far to good. (Eagan is best known for playing Mary Lennox in ""The Secret Garden"" on Broadway, for which she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical - at age 11.) I wanted ""Ripe"" to be good. I really did. Alas, there just isn't enough quality invested in this film to make it worth even a second glance.",979516800,24,1456,4.625482625482626
915133,4,6304603754,"The problem with most, this included, independent directors/writers, is that they feel mere innuendo is enough and lady or the tiger endings are  artful.
Innuendo is useful and frequently more erotic than out and out  nudity in the hands of a master.  In this movie, it merely is frustrating.  Even when our heroine is deflowered, she is still wearing a slip to  bed!
The ending is frustrating since we are not really sure what  happens--or is likely to happen--to either of the two girls.
Certainly  not the type of move I was expecting, but it did hold my interest and was  enjoyable.",967852800,4,586,4.676470588235294
915134,4,6304603754,"Ripe is not an exploitative Lolita sex film as the oversaturated key art may suggest.  Instead, it is a challenging, offbeat exploration of female sexuality and coming of age, imaginatively directed and well acted by its  three leads.
The script sometimes gets rocky and crude as with many indie  films (too much swearing is a curse in indie scripts), but the film is  visually stunning, and the cumulation of small moments is delicious -- when  Violet discovers the adult magazines, for example, or when the gruff man  who takes the sisters in has to explain menstruation to her.  And the final  scene with the two sisters is devastating, a weird amalgam of suspense,  family drama, and psychosexual overtones.
A wonderful music score by  Anton Sanko (ex-Suzanne Vega Band) augments this aesthetically excellent,  curiously poignant, ultimately very dark film.",946857600,22,861,5.166666666666667

915243,2,6304603754,"I'm undecided about my level of scoring on this movie.  A pair of 14 year old sisters run away from the scene of a car crash/burn their parents die in to be on their own as runaways.  They end up on a small army base, where a young good-looking guy lets them live in his house with him, posing as their uncle.  He gets physical with the one, which is mutual.  And then it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  I don't want to give away major plot points.  I didn't like the way things turned from here on out.

915311,3,6304603754,"As previously mentioned, the concept of the movie is great.  And whenever I unconsciously realize I'm enjoying the music far more than the movie, that's a sign that I've somehow disconnected from the film.  Initial dialog was totally unnecessary and detracted from the impact of events leading up to their departure.

The film is not entirely believable and the cover art, as is most often the case, doesn't really reflect the story line.

It was really difficult to like any of the characters beyond a certain scene, thereby making the experience somewhat disjointed.

The concept is interesting, but somehow just fell apart.",1418428800,,626,5.098039215686274
915312,1,6304603754,I didn't watch five minutes of it.,1413676800,,34,4.0
915313,2,6304603754,"As noted in some of the other negative reviews, there was some potential here, but wasted.

The Amazon description is very misleading, describing just the very beginning of the movie, making it sound like a teen version of Thelma & Louise or something, road trip and all, when there's really very little about the film that involves a road trip. It's certainly nothing to do with the core of the story.

The movie could have succeeded as a psychological thriller, but it just went so far off the reservation in terms of believability. I mean, sure one can expect literary license, but factually challenged elements undermine the whole experience. For example, the idea of a couple of young teens being permitted to run amok on an army base, even for a short while before base commander (or whoever) learns about them, seems very hard to accept and yet the plot fundamentally depends on this.

One criticism I don't share is of the acting of Keena and Eagan. Keena plays perfectly creepy and unconsciously seductive while Eagan does the protective but emotionally dependent sister, both quite well. And even script-wise, the nature of these children, on the verge of adulthood but still with much of the lack of judgment that comes with the immature mind, seems on the mark.

But overall, I just spent too much time thinking ""who acts like that? who ever acted like that, even decades ago?"" I didn't see any overt references, but judging from the wrecked ""brand new"" car in the opening act, it seems to be set in the 70s, and even back then it's hard to believe things would have been that lax. In the end, it seems to me that the one thing that brings a sense of uniqueness to the movie -- that this story of two sisters driven apart and to tragedy over immature feelings of jealousy, a not-uncommon story, involves newly-orphaned sisters and is set on an army base -- is also its biggest flaw.",1410220800,,1894,4.6447761194029855
915314,3,6304603754,"Coming out of age movie + over possessive and controlling sister + damaged family background = Thelma & Louise in teenage version. It has some interesting aspects, some character development and is beautifully acted.",1407542400,,216,5.382352941176471

915316,3,6304603754,"It's sad to note there are fathers in real life like the one the girls have in this movie. It's refreshing that one of the girls wants nothing to do with ""following in daddy's footsteps""!",1376006400,,187,4.371428571428571
915317,4,6304603754,"You have to have an open mind when watching this. It's not about connecting with the characters, but more so about you watching their journey from thinking like children-where love doesn't exist, except between two sisters, to a world of becoming young women. As you venture through their journey, you see jealousy, feelings of abandonment, and the struggle of child versus young woman.

This movie will be boring for those of you who are used to Hollywood movies of today. Or for those of you who are expecting sex, drugs, and violence.

As for my take on the movie, I felt it was beautifully done. I felt the bond between the two sisters, and understood their quirky relationship. I enjoyed watching both characters grow in their rightful ways and seeing them exposed to the world outside of their world. The ending was VERY unexpected and a huge twist.",1375488000,,855,4.77027027027027

915390,4,6304603754,"An old roommate suggested this film and after taking one look at the cover I thought, ""Um yeah, really...??"" But I'm actually glad I watched it. Ripe is NOT the perverted, exploitative testosterone-fest that its totally misleading cover suggests. Rather, it is a coming-of-age tale that explores a troubling IDEA in a challenging and fairly chaste manner. Sorry guys -- NO nudity, NO crude sneak-a-peek sex scenes. Rough language and some suggestive situations, yes -- but these are consistent with the concept director Mo Ogrodnik is trying to explore.

Clearly, this film was shot on a very low budget; and clearly, the script and setup skimp on (or totally overlook) several key details that would have certainly rounded out the characters and their story. For instance, there's NO way Pete's ""these are my nieces"" cover would have held water for more than three minutes, given the way the military dance thread unfolds. Also, while Violet is an extremely attractive teenage girl, Pete is also an outrageously buff and handsome guy who could probably have his choice of beautiful women. The movie can't seem to decide if it wants the viewer to perceive his character as an opportunistic creep; or as an introverted, lonely, misunderstood misfit seeking connection. An extremely icky vacuum scene with a dilapidated Karen Lynn Gorney from ""Saturday Night Fever"" (who desperately needs to find a new agent, and/or a new career) suggests the former; Pete's treatment by the soldiers implies the latter.

Many of the film's visuals are not only framed well but actually quite striking, and Anton Sanko's score is exceptional. Ultimately, Ripe explores some disturbing themes in a very poignant way, with a tone that darkens down to midnight black at the end. Overall, I mostly felt dejected that it missed its mark -- but that's only because I could see what it was trying so earnestly to articulate.",1355270400,8,1899,5.044585987261146
915391,4,6304603754,"This isn't a exploitation,underage soft porn,kiddie nudity, film or anything else like that.

It is... a film about loyalty. Between 14 year old twin sisters (fraternal..and they are as different as sisters from separate births!),and the growing ""maturity"" that is beginning to separate them. The silly ad  cover..is a lame reference  to Eve biting the apple from the Tree of Knowledge (of Good and Evil)..at the end of their stay in the Garden.

It was a surprise to me on a free rental with Amazon Prime. The 2 lead positive reviews on this site are pretty much on target.

This movie is not about titties,louche humor,or suggestive plot constructions. It develops slowly, and if you are looking for the attributes mentioned..it is definitely a waste of your time..even free. The ""coming of age movie"" has been done to death-usually with male protagonists..but...

915394,5,6304603754,Kind of a strange spin off of Lolita. I bought this a while back ago and lent it to someone and never got it back. That's ok though I wanna get the DVD soon anyway. ^_^,1237766400,,168,3.6944444444444446
915395,4,6304603754,"Ripe is a prime example of why it's best not to judge a book or a person by it's exterior! If there wasn't a synopsis attached with this DVD, with just the cover alone I would not expect for Ron Brice to be apart of this movie. Ron Brice (Ken) was my rationale for buying this movie! I like how Ken took Rosie under his wing & treated her as if she was his' daughter or neice. I can say thanks to the director for not having Ken & Rosie engage in sexual activity! I was pleased with Ron Brice's, Daisy's and Monica's characters, except for a few things... I couldn't fathom why Violet decided to hide her menstruation from Rosie being that they were so close? Being that all they had were each other Violet should've confided in Rosie. Then when she flushed her panties down the toilet I wanted to slap her, if she had washed it & put it aside then that would've made sense! I was curious to know which 1 was the oldest of the 2? I totally was disturb when Rosie smashed the 2 rats (un-called for). Another part in the movie that I didn't overstand is at the beginning when they played hide & seek with their father, was he playing with them or intoxicated?.. The mother said that she's calling the cops so it wasn't clear if he was playing or just abusive! Maybe he wasn't playing with a full deck, because I can't fathom why he would hold a rifle to little kids like he did! The seargeant's wife Mrs. Hyman was an old red-neck freak! She's promiscuous how dare she commit adultry & she has a little daughter! I loved Rosie's aggressiveness until she killed Pete... Pete invited them into his home & Rosie added insult to injury by killing him! I guess she felt that was the only way to seperate Pete & Violet? (it was wrong) Pete should've told Violet & Rosie about the money he'd received being that they were the reason that he made it!

By keeping it locked in his draw it made him look sneaky! With the exception of Ken (Brice) those guy's behaved like ignorant school boys filled with Hormones. Ken comes to Rosie's rescue when she gets drunk & Jimmy (Vincent) tries to take advantage of her. That's why 1 of the reasons why I'm in love with Brice

because his' roles are always hard-ass tough-guy(s)!!!! I wished that Rosie & Violet would have converse more than they did, then maybe their relationship would not have ended like it did? Violet was a snake for leaving Rosie with out telling her 1st! Violet took the bullets out of the chamber so that Rosie wouldn't commit suicide, but Rosie has access to get more ammunition (so that was redundant)!!!!

Regardless I would recommend this movie to someone with similar taste!",1116892800,8,2633,4.402464065708419
915396,4,6304603754,"Despite many discouraging reviews read on Amazon, I picked this movie up against my better judgement. Yes, the cover art is deceiving to the average, heterosexual man.  But, men are visual creatures, aren't they?  Taking three seconds to flip the box over, scan the description & you would have KNOWN that you were either buying or renting a certifiable CHICK FLICK. DUH!  Now, for all you chicks out there... This is an excellent coming of age story meets Thelma & Louise, meets Sister, My Sister.  Keegan and Eagan play sisters Violet, the beautiful, sexually curious younger sister (Keegan) and Rosie, the tomboy, gun-lovin' tough girl sister (Eagan).
The movie starts out with the girls being around 6 or 8 with a really violent homelife and parents that are abusive towards one another and towards the girls.  Car accident ensues and Rosie drags her sister from the burning car.  They VOW to be together FOREVER!
However... Violet's vow is broken as she becomes interested in sex and a long haired drifter with a motorcycle.  Rosie's vow was a real one & she gets emotionally crushed by her own sister.  The only person that she ever loved.
This movie is a great coming of age story with a wicked, surprise ending.  No real nudity to speak of, very little bad language, some brief sexual situations.  Not what the majority of the men who watched this film thought it was going to be.... Which is, in and of itself, the very reason I found the movie to be so great!

915397,3,6304603754,"Ripe is.. an interesting movie, to say the least.  Of course, as I'm sure was the case with others who rented this movie, the cover was what attracted me to it.  I am a heterosexual female, so it wasn't necessarily the sex appeal, but more so that title of the movie and the simplicity of the cover.  After reading the back of the box, I decided to check it out.  For some, perhaps most, this movie will be a let down.  You'd probably be expecting a sexually driven/teenage hormones extravaganza, but in the end, this movie is really the deep story of a very tough choice.  It's a look into the life of two teenage sisters, Rosie and Violet, on the run from the death of both of their parents.  Throughout the movie, I was constantly rolling my eyes and sighing from annoyance towards Rosie, the apathetic tomboy of the two.  Violet, sometimes seemingly naive and ignorant, had her share of sighs as well.  However, about 2/3 into the movie, my attitude towards all of this changed, as the storyline dramatically did as well.  The last twenty minutes were a real shock (some reviews said that this movie was very cliche, very unoriginal, and very predictable, but I disagree), and made the rest of the movie worth it.  I loved the ending -- just sad enough to make an impact.. had it ended any other way, I probably wouldn't be as satisfied with this movie.  All in all, Ripe is worth a shot if you have some time to burn and an open mind (not tarnished from these bad reviews).",1031788800,32,1478,4.433333333333334

Judged on it's own terms and not having to defend itself as one of those ""Indy"" films with all the baggage that goes along with that, it is a very decent movie that showed me some things I've never seen in a coming of age movie featuring girls. It's refreshing to see girls portrayed as something other than mindless bimbos or passive victims.
I like it's originality and the performances by the two lead actresses Monica Keena, and Daisy Eagan are spot on and very believable.
Every movie has something that might make it better. In this one a better exploration of the girl's background and their parents might have been nice and also a filling out of the reason for the rundown nature of the army base and the curious cast of characters there. In some ways the army base has almost a dream like quality cause it's a little unreal, but it's not a big enough problem to seriously detract from all the great things this movie has got going for it.
This is not a movie with lots of nudity or sex, so if that is what you are looking for, try something else. However if you want an enjoyable film with realistic characters and lots of drama and suspense then buy this movie!",1025740800,25,1320,4.413934426229508
