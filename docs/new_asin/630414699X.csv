791800,3,630414699X,"With little fanfare, MGM has quietly transferred a handful of great B films to DVD that they not too arbitrarily categorize as ""Midnight Movies.""  The nice looking digital prints are in their original theatrical format and appear as if they were taken from original material. The discs come with no substantial extras but care has been lavished on the box art, often reflecting the lurid lobby cards and posters of their initial release.  Even acknowledging the B category, these are for the most part well-crafted and, well, adequately acted.
In ""INVADERS FROM MARS"" Tobe Hooper directs a terrific cast -- Karen Black, Timothy Bottoms, Bud Cort and Louise Fletcher -- in a straightforward update of the of the 1953 cult classic.  This flip side to the benign aliens of ""E.T."" or ""Close Encounters"" delivers bad guys from space who not only want our planet but our souls as well.  Creepy fun that can still raise the hair on your neck.",1019088000,19,935,4.825
791801,3,630414699X,"While this version doesnt come close to the original, its not as terrible as some would imply. Karen Black (Linda) does a good job of playing the school nurse to whom little David (Hunter Thompson) can confide. Timothy Bottoms shows beyond a doubt he cannot act his way out of a paper bag and the monsters look like they could have escaped from the H.R. Puff N' Stuff saturday morning show of old. The special effects are pretty good and its a good story to start with. Hopefully the 1953 version will be re-released on DVD so those of us who missed it can enjoy both versions.",1009843200,2,577,4.401869158878505

791803,3,630414699X,"I never seen the 1953 original so I don't have it to compare with. But the 1986 Tobe Hooper's remake is ok. The special effects done by Stan Winston can't be all that bad anyway. The picture quality of the DVD is fine and the stereo surround soundtrack is below average but nothing much to complain about. But compared to my LD copy, this DVD is significantly better and it is already out of print. Give it a try, it is not as bad as people say it is.",970185600,,451,4.078651685393258
791804,2,630414699X,"The only good parts of this film are the title credits and the final shot of the movie. The special effects are no longer special, the acting bad, the dialogue corny, and the action scenes terrible. For a good Tobe Hooper  film, check out Salem's Lot instead. For real sci-fi/horror, check John  Carpenter's The Thing instead.",962668800,4,326,4.803571428571429
791805,1,630414699X,"Famed horror director Tobe Hooper should consider himself lucky that he had the chance to direct big budgeted sci-fi/horror movies, three of them as a matter of fact (Which is entirely unfair since George Romero never had  the chance to work on the big budget he deserved).  To refresh your memory,  the first was Poltergeist which was critically acclaimed, though I have to  say Hooper basically copied Spielberg's directing style in that film.  The  second was Lifeforce, a decent and entertaining sci-fi thriller about space  vampires trying to take over the Earth.  That film was a flop due to the  fact it didn't bring back even half its budget.  The film itself cost 28  million dollars which is equivalent to well over 70 million these days.  To  give you an even bigger sense of how expensive it was, Aliens (which came  out the year before Lifeforce), cost 19 million dollars to make.  The third  film was Invaders From Mars, a film that is absolutely terrible.  In what  had a promising premise, the film ruins it with the overuse of special  effects that are also extremely cheesy-looking.  Add along with that some  bad acting and equally terrible dialogue and you have a film that has the  quality of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  If you want to watch an  entertaining sci-fi horror film from Tobe Hooper, go with Lifeforce.  Otherwise, leave well enough alone.",959558400,5,1375,4.823275862068965
791806,3,630414699X,"Look, the whole point of this is that it's a B-movie!  And it is a good B-movie.  Admitedly I'm biased because it was filmed, in part, at the elementary school I attended, but I liked it even before I found out about  it.  What it comes down to is that if you like somewhat corny science  fiction but also appreciate at least a fairly serious attempt at a  realistic presentation, you should like this film.  If not, go watch  something else.  This movie doesn't try to be Star Wars, don't expect to be  one!
By the way, I happen to prefer a slightly different style of movie  now, so I can't give it more than a 3.  That doesn't mean it isn't worth  watching!  You just might want to rent.  ^_~",959472000,2,695,4.198473282442748

It contained senseless cursing from a ""all american family"" and a terrible child actor to saying it. It's like they took  the corniness of the first and thought, ""Hey, this needs to be even  MORE cornier!"". The special effects were better, but not good, even  for the 80's. I did appreciate how they gave the big brain thingy more of a  part, because I felt in the first one, he wasn't around enough.

791858,2,630414699X,"An unnecessary remake of the classic sci-fi film of the same name.  This time the story is played for laughs.  At the time of its release it was a box office bomb, making only 4.9 million on a 7 million budget.  It was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards: worst supporting actress Louise Fletcher and worst visual effects.  In this version, the boy who cried aliens is wholly unsympathetic and unnatural.  He continuously puts himself in harms way as he stumbles around inviting the unwanted attention of all the alien-controlled humans who are out to get him.  It starts on a low point, a boy and his father swearing like troopers as they watch meteors fall.  And then it only gets worse, racing to the inevitable payoff that doesnt payoff.

791958,3,630414699X,"A better film than some give it credit for; a worse film than some realize.  One has to understand here that Tobe Hooper was using his considerable talents at horror to in part lampoon horror films, while yet at the same time attempting to give you a dose of the true thing.  Whether this was a waste of his talents or not, I leave it to the viewer..

To believe that movie critics can properly view and appraise Horror films is not at all, anyway, a logical expectation...  To reiterate, ""Invaders"" is unusual, for the time, at being serio-comic.  Whether one can truly lampoon a horror film, and yet still be classified and succeed as true Horror, I hold as ultimately incorrect.  Though a very good attempt was made here.  The point is that the comedic element will be to degrees ruinous of the seriosity so needed of true Horror.  The idea that .. ""something like this"" ... can happen, or does happen...  Nonetheless, Hooper's inimitable style, and penchant for knowing and depicting evil, does again appear.

If I were to classify and recommend Hooper's three great Horror masterworks (in time, ""Salem's Lot"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""Lifeforce"") with this film, and with a recommended viewing schedule, I might start with ""Poltergeist"" (a joint project with Spielberg), then move to ""Salem's Lot"" (perhaps his best film, yet be sure to see *the longest cut of this film*, about 200 minutes), then ""Lifeforce"" (1985; a very interesting, if also very adult, movie), and only then ""Invaders..."" (1986).

All three of his previous Horror works mentioned I grant a perfect score of 5 stars.  The reason ""Invaders"" was lowered was because its droll, comedic element was somewhat overstretched, and that Hooper's attempted integration of Horror and Comedy did not work.  The film is notable nonetheless for Hooper's immense talents at depicting of evil.  His movies tend to be fairly adult works, bordering on X, and this is no exception.  I submit the mix of Horror and comedic elements can work, but only under the conditions that the film be a Farce, such as, for instance ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" (2003), or Wes Craven's ""The People Under the Stairs"" (1991)

Interesting though, Tobe Hooper was in step with the times here, in attempting the introduction of comedy.  Two years prior witnessed the release of the incredible serio-comic films ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension"" (Sci-Fi Fantasy Satire), and H. P. Lovecraft's ""Re-Animator"" (Horror Satire/Farce), both of which are very strong efforts.

My basic premise is that Horror Satire is conceivable, but not Horror Comedy.

The great era of Horror in American films (1970 to 1985) was indeed drawing to a close, and it had been quite a ride!  I submit there is an intellectual component to true horror which is critically important to realize, as well as difficult to actualize by the writer and director.  Of the great films of this type, besides Tobe Hooper's various offerings, are D. A. Coscarelli's ""Phantasm"" series, Craven's ""Invitation to Hell"" (1984), and John Carpenter's ""The Thing"".  These films will be important viewing, in the first decades of the 21st century: I hope we can learn from them.  One film of R. Corman's I would add here is ""The Tomb of Ligeia"" (1964).

The great Horror Satire films, or Horror Farces:  Wes Craven's ""The People Under the Stairs"" (1991); John Carpenter's homage to B movies in ""They Live"" (1988); D. A. Coscarelli's wildly adult ""Bubba-Hotep"" (2003); and H. P. Lovecraft's ""Re-Animator"" (1984).  ""Invaders..."" fails from being a Farce because of its structure and attempt at being earnest; yet it fails at Horror in mixing in so many ridiculous, illogical, or wildly improbable situations [the 'humorous' elements]...  I give the film therefore three stars, largely on the ground of the talents of the director, and because of an intriguing premise.",1437350400,,3866,4.990639625585024

Great acting performances by Actress Karen black, Louise Fletcher, Actor Hunter carson, Timothy bottoms & James karen
along with amazingly incredible creature effects by Stan winstons special creature effects team
Stan winston, Alec Gillis, Richard Landon, Gino crognale, Steve Johnson and many others
that made all the Invader creatures come to life and believe me the creatures do look very realistic it's stunning & scary
some of these Great artists are now teaching special effects courses for young students
incredible!

so time to throw out the very old MGM dvd release of this film
scream factory have given this 80's classic a new High Definition transfer in 2:35:1 widescreen
plus a new 5.1 Master audio mix & the master audio stereo mix to if you want the Mono sound
the picture quality does look stunning very nice sharp & clear picture quality for sure, much better quality than the very old dvd release
plus the 5.1 sound quality has been boosted for sure & sounds really Good through my surround sound system
scream factory really made the effort with this film no Doubt about it
and new special features of course
THE MARTIANS ARE COMING
a new 35min retrospective featurette with Director Tobe Hooper, child actor Hunter carson
plus interviews with special creature effects artists Alec Gillis & Gino crognale who
were part of stan winston's team making the invader creatures for the film
and a interview with Music composer Chris young who did the Music score for the film
very interesting 30-35mins, you can tell Tobe Hooper has aged big time his memory is fading that's for sure
while he was trying to give recollections filming Invaders from mars
Producer Menahem Golan passed away at 85 about 1 year ago now otherwise he may have been interviewed
also Actress Karen black is not interviewed, Karen tragically passed away about 2 years ago now of cancer
otherwise she probably would've been interviewed for this blu-ray
Actress Louise fletcher is not interviewed either, maybe she declined
Actors Timothy Bottoms & James karen are not interviewed maybe they both declined
so Hunter carson is the only Actor been interviewed for this blu-ray actually

there's also a new Audio commentary by Tobe Hooper
plus the vintage TV promo featurette used in 1986 to promote the film
plus the usual Theatrical trailer, TV spots, Still photo Gallery, original storyboards
Definitely time to upgrade and get this new blu-ray version of the film, scrap the very old MGM DVD release
maybe 3-4 stars for the film itself, 5 stars for this new blu-ray",1432425600,4,2725,4.908893709327549

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Fans of Tobe Hoopers 1986 film INVADERS FROM MARS can jump for joy, with Scream! Factorys new Collectors Edition Blu-ray, and its definitely a release to check out. Loaded to the brim with brand new and retro special features, the film does an excellent job of bringing back not only a sense of nostalgia for old school fans of the film, but introduces a fun and campy ride for its new viewers.

Personally, I think the film and its content all speak for themselves, but just in case you have a question or two regarding the release, weve got you covered, having taken a look at the release and we can definitely assure you, its one of the most entertaining family sci-fi horror films of all time.

Late one evening a small boy sees a UFO landing in the open field behind his home. He tells his parents who obviously do not believe him. However, the following morning his father is behaving strangely, as if he is possessed by an alien intelligence. (What does his father do that is so weird? He gulps down his morning coffee in one single gulp, which perhaps isn't all that weird . . .)

More strange behaviour: the boy spies his less-than-favourite teacher gulping down a bull frog (now that's weird) and his mother serves up breakfast bacon burnt to a crisp (perhaps not really that weird either) and eats raw hamburger patty meat (not so weird). Anyway, all of the people displaying this weird behaviour have funny wounds at the base of their necks. Soon it is becoming apparent that Earth is being invaded by aliens, but who would believe a small boy?

If the story sounds familiar then you have probably seen the original 1953 film (of the same title) of which this is a remake by producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus. If you havent, but the material still seems familiar, then you have either seen any of the three versions of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (thats right: three of them!) Interestingly enough, the original Invaders From Mars actually predates the original 1956 Black & White Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

Film critics weren't the only ones who didn't take to Cannons produce though, but by the time the Nineties rolled around; the company was bankrupt as ordinary audiences stayed away in droves. Despite Invaders From Mars being one of Cannons better films. The brilliant special effects by legendary John Dykstra (Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica) and the various creatures brought to life by Stan Winston are perfect for the time it was filmed in 1986 and to great effect.

The acting is suitably camp (you just got to love Louise Fletcher (Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest) as everyones Most Hated Primary School Teacher from Hell, plus the dialogue is so over the top, that makes the film enjoyable, especially when tyey say, Marines have no qualms about killing Martians, son, and also Marines do not carry change is my all-time favourite. But the films tempo is quick and keeps the pace going well.

Also, material that seems fine for the paranoid Cold War-era 1950s seems a bit odd when remade for the mid-1980s despite Reagan-era gung ho-ism. Viewed today one can easily see what John Clute meant when he said that 1950s sci-fi movies were really about anti-intellectualism. In one scene in this film a NASA scientist tries to communicate with the aliens, naturally he is blown to smithereens with a death ray, quite a satisfying scene from the film and a warning never try to pacify a Martian Drone.

Sometimes, certain aspects of a movie can make up for areas in which its quality is lacking. I would say thats the case for Invaders From Mars. The great visuals provided by the sets and the creature design combined with the story to help me enjoy this film very much and especially watching this re-mastered Blu-ray disc and I know of other fans of this cult sci-fi film will also enjoy viewing it and is definitely a fun ride for its time. So check it out you sci-fi nuts, as it is well worth purchasing this Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Invaders From Mars makes its grand arrival on Blu-ray courtesy of Scream! Factory on a Region A locked Blu-ray disc. The disc opens to the similarly formatted Scream! Factory main menus with music from the main film and clips in the background playing throughout. Film grain is alive and well, while never being too intrusive leading to outstanding detail levels. For a creature feature, all you have to do is look at the monster work by Stan Winston to see that this movie probably has never looked better. Colours are rich and totally wonderful. Invaders from Mars eclipses its previous NTSC DVD and LaserDisc inferior releases.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Sporting a fantastic awesome 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and a 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio track and Invaders From Mars gets a truly pleasing audio debut. If you want to remain authentic to the original experience, then stick with the 5.1 audio tracks, as the imaging on both tracks are deliciously creepy in places as well as the voices, and the subtle sound effects. Levels are well balanced and the tracks are free from any hiss, pops, or breaks anomalies.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: New Audio Commentary with Director Tobe Hooper and Moderator Michael Felsher: This is a totally fascinating audio commentary and Michael Felsher sounds like a total enthusiast for the Invaders From Mars and makes for an enjoyable audio commentary. We get to find out that Tobe Hooper copied the film title wording from Superman and very effective they are and what a shame the film was not in 3D, as the titles would of looked totally awesome in that format. They also talk about the original Invaders From Mars [1953] and mentions William Cameron Menzies [Production Designer], who had sadly passed away, plus most of the original cast from the Invaders From Mars [1953] had also sadly passed away, but by luck Tobe Hooper was able to get the original actor Mr. Jimmy Hunt, who is one of the policemen in the 1986 film, who was the original boy in the 1953 film. A very nice thing they say is the acknowledgement of the fact that Karen Black had also passed away and totally respected her acting ability, especially in this 1986 film. Tobe Hooper wanted to put his own slant on this film, especially wanting Louise Fletcher in the film, who was not keen to eat the frog. Michael Felsher was in total awe of the Martian spaceship tunnels, that were built on the Howard Hughes Hanger and they were real neat sets, which I agree also totally amazing, and having Hunter Carson, the little boy in the tunnel, makes the tunnels look even more massive in size. When we get to chapter 7, where Karen Black and Hunter Carson go back to the school, Tobe Hooper points out several things relating to the original 1953 film, where he mentions again getting Mr. Jimmy Hunt, who was the original young boy in the 1953 film and also pointing out when Karen Black and Hunter Carson are down in the basement of the school, Tobe Hooper points out when the policemen are scanning their torches around the basement, you will see the original  Martian Supreme Intelligent being in the glass bowl from the 1953 sci-fi film. Tobe Hooper also points out when the military are down in the Martian spaceship tunnels, and especially when the Martian drones appear, that inside the rubber suits are beach muscle guys, they had to walk backwards, while viewing everything on a small TV monitor and on top of those guys were small female assistants operating the arms. As we get to near the end of the film, Tobe Hooper says he had a great affection for making this remake film and a total homage to the original 1953 film and also hopes people over the years will appreciate his work on this 1986 film, but of course all sci-fi aficionados of this cult film find it totally brilliant, that has a massive cult following, which is what I also feel about this brilliant sci-fi masterpiece.

Factory presents us with a totally unique and special feature, where we get to hear about this 1986 sci-fi film and takes us through a fascinating insight into this particular sci-fi genre film, because we get the likes of contributors of Tobe Hooper; Hunter Carson; Alec Gillis and Gino Crognale. Again they all talk a great deal at their great affection for this particular camp sci-fi film and the comments by Tobe Hooper were most interesting and wanted his 1986 film to be squarely aimed at the childs view of what was happening to his family and his perspective on adults not listening to him. Tobe Hooper also informs us this his 1986 sci-fi film was at the time of its release was a complete financial flop, but when the film was released on a VHS video tape and other home viewing media, it has gained a cult status and now even more with this Blu-ray release, which I concur 100%. Another nice thing Tobe Hooper informed us that he was proud and honoured to have the well-established female actors Karen Black and Louise Fletcher. Hunter Carson was equally enamoured by Louise Fletcher, as they got on so well together, even to the point they always had their lunch break together and that Louise Fletcher was very funny. The two guys who did the special creature effects had a riotous ball and really enjoyed their experience, but not especially when Gino Crognale was in the Martian Supreme Leader rubber suit caught fire, they had a desperate job to get him out of the costume and was nearly badly burned, but luckily was able to be released from the costume. The only person I was not comfortable in viewing was the composer Christopher Young, who was totally weird and would hate to come face to face with him in a dark alley, as he looks totally menacing. But despite this, this was a really special feature and a definite must watch.

Theatrical Trailer & TV Spot: Here you get to see just two trailers, which are as follows: Theatrical Trailer [1986] [480i] [16:9] [1:26] and TV Trailer [1986] [480i] [4:3] [00:32]

Special Feature: Original Production Illustration Gallery from Artist William Stout with Audio Commentary by William Stout [2015] [1080p] [16:9] [14:02] Here we get an extra specially presentation by William Sout, who does an awesome audio commentary, especially while his stunning personal illustrations are being shown on your TV screen and talks extensively of his love for the 1953 Invaders From Mars sci-fi film and especially informs us that he is a massive huge fan of the work of William Cameron Menzies [Production Designer], who is also one of his biggest heroes as well. One of his favourite designs that he hoped would get accepted, was the crew T-shirts, but sadly was not accepted. Another interesting anecdote he informs us about, is the theory why people work in the film industry, especially in America, is that some only work just for the money, which he feels is a very negative attitude, which is totally ridiculous, as you earn every single penny that you make in the movie industry, whereas his favourite thing on working on movies is the story he walks away with each individual movie and especially working on the 1986 Invaders From Mars, which is personally his all-time favourite story. He also tells us that they contacted the United States Air Force, because they needed a lot of military hardware for the 1986 film and they were sent a script; but after sometime there was no reply back and eventually they came back to the studio after a lot of panic and came back with a statement, which William Stout reads out the actual statement that reads as follows, Im sorry, but the United States Air Force cannot co-operate in the making of this motion picture and he asks them, Why, because you guys are the heroes and you are the good guys, and the military that saves the day and kills the Martians, and they reply back, It is the official position of the United States Air Force that there are no Martians and there are no UFOs and William Stout never thought this an issue and was panic stricken. But with a stroke of luck, he was able to get in contact with the United States Marines Public Relations Liaison Officer and he was told that he would have complete co-operation of all the United States Marines in the making of the 1986 sci-fi film. He also gives great praise for Cannon Films, as they were very enthusiastic in making films for up and coming young ideas. But what I liked about this special audio commentary by William Stout, who has a really terrific calming voice and is also very interesting and fascinating intelligent guy and also you get to see in great detail all of his fantastic illustrations and is a definite one to view. Happy viewing!

Special Feature: Original Storyboards [2015] [1080p] [16:9] [4:16] This is like a slide show, where you get to view all of the storyboard drawings used for the film and at the same time you get the background music from the film. I personally found this rather boring, as all the drawings are in black-and-white, totally yawns ville!

Special Feature: Still Gallery [2015] [1080p] [16:9] [12:12] Here we get to view lots of colour image stills from the film in the form of another automatic slide show and you finally get to view a total of 27 images. Sadly it is totally silent compared to the storyboard slide show. But despite this it is great to view. Happy viewing!

Finally, its a wonderfully camp rollercoaster well done film, made at a time when Tobe Hooper was given the opportunity to create big, elaborate sets and ambitious projects. The colours look astonishing on this Blu-ray release, and that ambitious period of Tobe Hoopers filmography just screams for a good Blu-ray release and this is definitely it. Some think the last quarter of the film heads into silly-territory, but its just the kind of silly that one would expect from a film called Invaders From Mars and will also fit nicely in your Blu-ray collection. It has all the elements of the coming-of age films of the 1980s directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, and others. The only difference is it delves a bit deeper into the horror and sci-fi realms. Its exactly the sort of genre movie you would expect from Poltergeist Director Tobe Hooper. Highly Recommended!

Director Tobe Hoopers remake of the 1953 classic takes the always successful Amblin Entertainment formula made famous through films like E.T.: The Extra-terrestrial, Space Camp, and Explorers and adds his own flair. He takes those familiar ingredients and combines them with frightening aliens intent on taking over the world one small town at a time.

In ""Invaders from Mars,"" a boy (Hunter Carson) begins seeing his parents and neighbors act like zombies. Is it a coincidence the weirdness all started after a flying saucer landed in his back yard?

The big genre star in Invaders from Mars is veteran genre actor Karen Black. Shes perfectly cast in the role of the panicked and constantly tormented school nurse who believes our young lead character is telling the truth. Is she a little overdramatic and campy at times? Of course she is shes Karen Black in a horror movie!

Invaders from Mars is rated PG in that wonderful way many 1970s and 1980s movies were. It contains a lot of content that wouldve merited it at least PG-13 today. The movie includes violence but no real gore. Many sequences will frighten younger viewers because of how the aliens appear and the intensity theyll feel as the lead characters are chased down. The young boy in the film has quite a filthy mouth, much like his counterparts in several other movies featuring children experiencing fantastic adventures in the 1980s.

Scream Factory filled the Blu-ray edition of Invaders from Mars with all sorts of bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by Director Tobe Hooper. Hooper, Actor Hunter Carson, Special Creature Effects Artists Alec Gillis and Gino Crognale, and Composer Christopher Young all participate in the all-new The Martians Are Coming!  The Making of Invaders from Mars documentary. It also features a theatrical trailer, TV spot, original storyboards, and an original production illustration gallery from Artist William Stout.

Invaders from Mars will fit nicely in your Blu-ray collection between The Goonies and The Monster Squad. It has all the elements of the coming-of age films of the 1980s directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, and others. The only difference is it delves a bit deeper into the horror and sci-fi realms. Its exactly the sort of genre movie you would expect Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist Director Tobe Hooper would want to watch as an alienated (pun intended) boy.",1430092800,,2508,5.090024330900243

792018,4,630414699X,"REMEMBER that nightmare where you woke up, walked into the next room and saw your parents had turned into monsters?
Then woke up again from the shock, whipped into the kitchen to tell the rents about the dream, and discover  da-da-DA!!!  your parents really were monsters!

OK, maybe that dream isn't all that common, but its the premise of director Tobe Hoopers campy sci-fi horror flick, Invaders from Mars  a 1986 remake of the 1953 gem from director William Cameron Menzies and writer Richard Blake.

Ten-year-old science nerd David Gardner (Hunter Carson) discovers the Martians have landed not too far from his backyard. He soon discovers Dad, Mom, mean school teacher Mrs. McKeltch  played like an over-the-top Nurse Ratched by none other than Louise Fletcher herself  and a good part of the local population have been taken over by invading Martians. Created by effects master Stan Winston, they appear as bulbous plastic brains with skinny little arms and legs shades of 50s pulp covers.

Indeed, the effects are amazingly cheesy, the script  updated by Dan OBannon and Don Jakoby  as wacky, and acting  well, broad covers it pretty well. Laraine Newman, Connie Conehead of SNLs infamous sketch series, plays Davids mother, and if that isn't a give-away, you've missed the mothership.

David is supported in his findings by the school nurse played by Karen Black, who actually is Carsons mother. The possession ""tell,"" as they discover, is the hole in the back of peoples necks where the Martians have invaded, so to speak. Soon, David and the nurse are at NASA, telling the general and his army how to proceed.

The Blu-ray transfer from Scream Factorys imprint, Shout! Factory, is pretty good. Color is vivid and black levels solid, but detail is hazy in some scenes. There is noticeable dirt and scratch marks towards the second half of the film. Sound comes via a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 track, remastering the original mono presentation. Sound effects are as deliberately goofy as the film, bouncing appreciatively around the room on the 5.1 track. Dialogue and a score from Christopher Young come through clearly. In the new making-of extra, Young talks about how his original composition was rejected via studio miscommunication.

The Martians are Coming: The Making of Invaders from Mars is a real treat, full of interviews from the cast and crew. Anecdotes are priceless, especially the re-telling of a near-death experience of an effect gone wrong. Its also covered in the rollicking commentary by Hooper and Michael Felsher of Red Shirt Pictures. Both new extras make this well worth the purchase price. And, after all the super-serious, state-of-the-art sci-fi we've been hit with, its fun to sit back and laugh for a change.

Adults are sure to find Invaders as silly as it sounds. However, if you're between the ages of 5 to 8, you might want to leave the lights on and the door open when you go to bed.   Kay Reynolds",1429574400,,2977,4.922

Over the years, I've seen it maybe a dozen times, and although it no longer frightens me, it still has a certain creepiness I can't help but enjoy. I also like the circularity of the plot...is it a dream? Is it real? Is the main character trapped in a whirlpool of time? Like the little known classic Dead Of Night, this movie ends where it begins. It's not a great movie, it's not especially well-acted, it's not Star Wars, but it does have its own weird attraction.",1429228800,,582,4.15929203539823

The movie itself I love. Everything about the premise, special effects and plot I love. The hate comes from the kid actor who is just painfully excruciating to watch. In my opinion it just about ruins the movie. I didn't realize for years that the kid was Karen Blacks son. One has to wonder the back story there after seeing this kid can't act to save his life or the movie and Tobe Hooper was willing to make him the lead character.

I expected your typical 80's sci-fi/horror flick but I was surprised at how well done some of the story actually is. While not top rate by any stretch it still has it's own vibe of interesting that really made me want to see it through.
The director really helped that great alien invasion feel with the plot pacing and it did a pretty good job of giving the creepy vibe which is not something that I see often these days.
While the alien designs weren't particularly good they certainly had a horrifying element and looked creepy as hell. However the actors weren't all that good. Sure there were some good moments and some that really got ya but overall a lot of the acting was a little hammy.
I felt the kid was pretty interesting, he didn't come off as the all knowing twerp who intuitively knows the aliens before he see's them or as the instantly understanding type, he actually pulled off the terrified little kid bit rather well in most cases. Although I still don't get that whole flapping arms as he ran business, the director needs a good smack for that one lol.
All in all a pretty fun film to watch and the ending will keep you wondering so I recommend it for a nice cheesy movie night or popcorn night.
Just remember it's a B movie so don't expect independence day lol.",1410220800,,1408,4.357414448669202
792127,2,630414699X,"The 1952 original 'Invaders From Mars' is a great classic. But this 1986 remake has that cheesy 1980's made-for-TV feel, and very little in common with the wonderful original. Not much happens here. And this is a really uninspired low-budget effort. Karen Black looks embarrassed to find herself in it.
See it on Amazon Streaming for free. But don't even think about spending money to rent it. I can't imagine wanting to own it.

I am a HUGE fan of the 1952 original 'Invaders'. These two have NOTHING in common after the opening shots.
Where the 1952 original is fast-paced, smart, atmospheric and full of unforgettable surreal shots, this 1986 remake draaaaaaags along at a snails' pace and seems timed for TV commercials to be inserted.
The chief villain here is the little boy's schoolteacher, a 'new' character not in the original, and she's only scary if you're afraid of middleaged women with frowns, chasing you in a flowered dress and Sensible Schoolteacher Shoes.

All the surreal psychological doom of the original is gone here. Karen Black plays the School Nurse, who mostly drives our little boy around town screaming repeatedly 'We've got to get out of here!"" to herself. She really does look visibly embarrassed to be in this, and you can actually see her cringing as she delivers her lines.

Overall, this remake is somewhere between an MST3K selection and an SNL parody. A shame, because the Original script is truly a classic.

See it on Amazon Streaming for free and leave it on as background noise while you do the laundry or organize your closet.
I give it 2 stars from sheer pity, and out of respect to the memory of the 1952 Original. Go enjoy the Original again instead of this.

This is a loving tribute to the first half of that movies essence- mindless, unapologetic, popcorn fun. And in that, it is a success. Looking like a mix between Hoopers own funky style, with more then a touch of John Carpenter, the visuals and pacing make it worth putting up with a cast lacking in standouts.

This was my first movie by Tobe Hooper, Poltergeist was better than this, but it's still enjoyable for me. The cast maybe unknown to some, but I know some of them-esp. Timothy Bottoms as the father, remember Land of Faraway, the King? In this though, he's not nearly as nice, or gentle, but he plays his part well. Karen Black, who plays the school nurse, is apparently best known for charecter roles, in particular horror and sci-fi. Still, she does a nice job. Then there's Louise Fletcher, whose role as a menacing teacher, probably couldn't do better, although maybe Helen Mirren could've, but she might've refused the frog-eating scene.

792187,4,630414699X,"Sooner or later, someone in Hollywood will remake not only every classic film that has been ever made, but every half-way decent film, too.  The original 1953 INVADERS FROM MARS really isn't a great piece of sci-fi, but it is regarded as a classic because of some of the magnificent images in the movie, e.g. the lights behind the hill with the fence and people being sucked by a swirling vortex into the ground.  In the early 1980s, Tobe Hooper (of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE fame) set out to remake his favorite movie of all time, INVADERS FROM MARS.

The movie revolves around David Gardner (Hunter Carson).  David loves astronomy.  One night during a freak thunderstorm he thinks he sees a spaceship land not far from their house, just over a hill.  He tells his parents about it, but they think he was just dreaming.  However, David's father, George (Timothy Bottoms), investigates and when he returns in the morning he is a different man.  He tells David he was right, that there was something just over the hill but before he gets a chance to show David, the school bus arrives to take David to school.  Later, David's mother and school teacher start acting just as strange as his dad and David suspects that aliens are involved.  After he catches his teacher secretly eating during a meal, he knows aliens have invaded and are taking over people's bodies.  He meets with the only person he feels he can trust, the school nurse, Linda Magnussen (Karen Black).  Initially she doesn't believe David, but does believe something is going wrong in his life.  But after seeing the truth for herself, she sets out with David for a nearby military base for help.

When this version of INVADERS FROM MARS was initially released, it was panned by critics and bombed at the box office.  People kept talking about how good the original was and that this movie just didn't live up to it.  I don't think any of those people ever saw the original movie because other than some amazing visuals and some fine acting by Jimmy Hunt as David Maclean, the 1953 INVADERS FROM MARS isn't that great of a movie. There's really only one alien in that movie and the rest are a bunch of Martian/human hybrid mutants that are referred to as ""moo-tants"" (instead of  ""mew-tunts) and are portrayed by people in green makeup and rubber suits running around with their hands in a robotic positions.  The budget was so low that the interior of the cave in the original was made from blown-up condoms that were painted over. It's true that watching the original movie now, there is a certain charm to it that initial viewers of the remake might not have felt upon watching the remake.

Still, you can tell that Tobe Hooper was a major fan of the original movie because his version carefully replicates the best parts of that movie and sometimes the worst (including the terrible ending).  However, he updates the movie with a more modern feel and also leaves his own special touch in a few places.  The result is a fun little piece of sci-fi horror that is overall actually just as good if not a tad better than the original.  It's a mix of humor, sci-fi action, and horror that at times borders on campy, but is blended fairly well.  Also, watching the movie over 20 years after its initial release, the remake has a certain charm to it to, though of a far different kind than the original.

That's not to say INVADERS FROM MARS is a great movie, because it's not.  However, it is a fun one.  It's a movie that people would probably enjoy watching on a rainy day or late at night when they can't get to sleep.

The extras on the DVD include an original publicity featurette, a sci-fi featurette, and the original theatrical trailer.",1275091200,2,3707,4.594224924012158

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  this movie quite possibly qualifies as one of the most godawful movies of all time and i
  hope and pray it did not ruin laraine newmans and a lot of other actors/actresses' careers.
  (i am just now researching her movie background so i don't know but, my beloved SNL)
  BUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  YET :
  it actually is some fun to watch. if you don't take it seriously!
  and a few parts are kinda hilarious.
  the school teacher steals the show if you ask me.
  love when she *oh god no a spoiler!* tries to drag the boy out of the car.
  and it is nice to watch ~ when i knew karen black is really the boys mother
  that was special so i give it three stars instead of negative 5 and an armed riot ~*
  but i thought it would be funny to come write a silly review.
  i'm just trying to be funny ~ i liked this movie even though it was a colossal trauma
  trying to force myself to survive all the way thru i could have sworn three weeks passed instead of
  an hour and a half.
  the monsters/aiens were funny. and the pajama part at the end awakened a new me.  it's hard to explain but i really liked that part.
  this deserves 5 stars for karen black and son, that is special and i really liked that.
  anyone else says anything bad and i will intentionally throw up on them just to be mean.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  WAIT!
  i watched this movie again ~ after posting this review. (annnnd???)
  and ~ something strange happened. i am really liking watching this again.
  i am particularly getting much value of the karen black and son (hunter carson)
  roles.
  what happened.  perhaps the aliens got to me and possessed me.
  suddenly i am really liking this movie.
  i was somewhat overtly hypercritical in my previous review.
  this is not a bad series of movies this midnite movies thing.
  btw 'land that time forgot' is a great one ~ it is another midnight movie dvd

Since it was an older DVD, the transfer quality was poor and I would have enjoyed one made with higher resolution.  Still entertaining.

I remember seeing this fun remake with my wife and boys right after it was made in 1986. The audience was made up of several ""older"" fans of the original who appeared very excited about the possiblities of this new film. In fact, they were so excited and animated that they made me feel a little ashamed of being a member of their somewhat senior age group! In any case this fun remake really worked for me.",1240704000,,760,4.4855072463768115

The extra footage is interesting and they show how everything was created for the film.  The only disappointment is that they changed some scenes from the VHS version when they digitally remastered it.  They also left some really good scenes out.  But the digital quality is amazing.

If this film is supposed to be a send-up of the original, it failed miserably. Conversely, if this was supposed to be a hip, insider's sci-fi flick, it seems so very self-conscious and phony. At least ""Mars Attacks!"" never took itself seriously. A marvelous cast (Timothy Bottoms, Louise Fletcher, Larraine Newman, to name a few) is completely wasted in what undoubtedly will become a Worst Movie of All Time award recipient.",1155513600,3,572,5.095744680851064

792230,3,630414699X,"Before I start my review I'd like to say that Timothy Bottoms sure looks like George W. Bush(ironically, his character in the film is named George).  I don't know if this film is trying to be a homage or a parody of 1950's sci-fi films.  Either way, it does not succeed.  To the films detriment, the make-up and special effects aren't really that good considering that they were designed by Oscar winners John Dykstra and Stan Winston.  The film doesn't move that well;it just kind of lumbers along.  The adult actors are adequate but not outstanding.  Louise Fletcher seems to be channeling Nurse Ratched in her role as the mean biology teacher.  Bud Cort(of ""Harold and Maude"" fame) has a strange little role as a scientist.  What keeps this film grounded is the performance of young Hunter Carson(real-life son of co-star Karen Black) as David Gardner, the kid who sees all the strange goings on but is having a hard time convincing the adults.  He makes the film watchable.  If not for him I would rate this film two stars instead of three.",1098662400,5,1044,4.655737704918033

792232,3,630414699X,"The original 1953 INVADERS FROM MARS is a cult classic, appreciated for both its influence on later similar films and the fact that it reads as hilariously corny by today standards.  But this 1986 remake--in spite of a big budget, several very talented actors, and a deliberately campy script--is unlikely to inspire the same sort of loyalty, and it was universally condemned by critics and audiences alike when first released.
That said, the film really isn't as bad as you may have heard.  The plot follows the original version quite closely: the imaginative young son (Hunter Carson) of two loving parents (Timothy Bottom and Laraine Newman) catches sight of a UFO as it lands beyond the hill behind his house--and when his father goes out to investigate he returns... well... different.  When his mother and his evil school teacher (Louise Fletcher) follow suit, he turns to the school nurse (Karen Black), and together the two alert the local military to the strange goings-on.
The cast is really quite good.  Although the script gives her little to do beyond run around screaming, Karen Black has a unique screen presence--and it is as evident here as it is in her more celebrated films.  Her real life son, Hunter Carson, does the honors as the child lead, and aquits himself very well.  But the most memorable performances are from Laraine Newman, Timothy Bottom, and Louise Fletcher, who are transformed by the UFO and sent abroad to do the aliens' evil will.  Fletcher is particularly enjoyable, wringing the most from her role as every child's nightmare school teacher.  The special effects have dated and seem remarkably derrivative, a mix of STAR WARS and ALIEN, but they too are entertaining in their own way, and although it isn't always successful the script has enough campy humor (much of it in reference to the original) to give you an occasional hoot.
As pure fluff, the 1986 INVADERS FROM MARS works very well, and kids ten and up are likely to find it extremely entertaining.  Still, I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for this particular movie.  It is mindlessly entertaining, but I don't think it is a film to which many viewers will care to return.",1041379200,23,2178,4.846361185983827

7862767,5,630414699X,"INVADERS FROM MARS (1986) is about a boy named David Gardner (Hunter Carson), who believes he's witnessed the landing of an alien spacecraft behind his house. It appears to have burrowed into the earth. Of course, his mom and dad (Ellen- Laraine Newman and George- Timothy Bottoms) don't believe him. Then, the next morning, George starts behaving oddly, causing David to suspect that something is terribly wrong. When others, including mom, begin acting in equally bizarre ways, David fears that whatever is in the ground out back is behind it. As the phenomenon spreads, David seeks help from his school nurse, Linda Magnusson (Karen Black- TRILOGY OF TERROR, BURNT OFFERINGS), who seems to be one of the only people he can trust. When she sees things that convince her that David is telling the truth, Linda sets out to assist him. Meanwhile, David does some sleuthing, trying to get to the bottom of whatever is happening in a mysterious system of tunnels in his back yard. I'm a huge fan of the original version of this film, so I expected this to be another disastrous retread. However, it holds its own, adding a fresh, new spin on the classic tale of extraterrestrial conspiracy and paranoia. It helps that it was directed by Tobe Hooper (THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, POLTERGEIST), and that the alien monsters were brought to life by special effects wizard, Stan Winston (THE TERMINATOR 1 and 2, ALIENS, PREDATOR). Don't miss the subterranean finale! Co-stars Louise Fletcher (ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) as the ultra-creepy Mrs. McKeltch, and James Karen (POLTERGEIST, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD) as General Wilson!
