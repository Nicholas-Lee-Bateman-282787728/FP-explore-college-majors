7113287,5,B00VX223UY,Ordered this before the complete four season set was available. Very funny series.,1438732800,,82,5.384615384615385
7113288,5,B00VX223UY,"It's WKRP! How can it NOT be good?  (Only if it doesn't have licensing of the original songs in the original episodes, I haven't viewed it to verify if that's the case.) I just received it and plan on enjoying it.",1437264000,,213,4.195121951219512
7113289,5,B00VX223UY,"WKRP in Cincinnati is a wonderful creation of Hugh Wilson that entertained millions of fans on TV in late 1970s and early 1980s. For many of us the highlight of the week was to watch this show on TV. The success of this show is due to Bill Dial, a great writer, and a team of wonderful actors who made this show stand out as one of the top 5 on my all time great sitcom list. The show starred Gordon Jump as confused yet always beloved station manager Arthur Carlson; Gary Sandy as self assured program director Andy Travis; Loni Anderson as brainy and beautiful Jennifer Marlowe, the highest paid station receptionist; Experienced actor Howard Hesseman as a down and out disc jockey; Tim Reid as the second DJ who was a chemistry teacher; Jan Smithers as lovable Bailey Quarters, the publicity director of the station; Frank Bonner as a sleazy and womanizing sales director; and Richard Sanders as funny, accident-prone news director with interest in hogs and dislike for communism. The third season of the show aired some of the interesting episodes of the series. ""Daydreams"" is my favorite episode in which Mr. Carlson rehearses a dull speech in front of the WKRP staff, all the staffers drift off into daydreams about what they would like to be. Andy dreams as a mafia boss who recruits a hit-man to hit a DJ; Jennifer as a movie star who is in love with a famous director; Johnny as a famous rock star; Herb dreams as a Latin-American dictator with Jennifer as his girlfriend; Les as a reporter covering the WWII with Bailey as his assistant; Venus as a standup comedian; and Bailey as the speech-writer for the president of the United States with Johnny as her husband. ""Nothing To Fear But fear itself"" is another hilarious episode where everyone is in the grip of urban paranoia after the station is robbed, and the crew makes an interesting conversation about owning a fire arm for protection. ""Ask Jennifer"" is another great episode when a new call-in advice show is unable to go on the air, Andy convince Jennifer to take over and she becomes an instant success until a woman who acts on Jennifer's advice faces retaliation from her boyfriend. ""Venus and the Man"" is an educational episode; the station's cleaning lady asks Venus to convince her big and tough teenage son not to drop out of school. This episode tackles an important problem in the society where a high school kid feels that pushing drug can make him richer than staying in school. An inexperienced Venus, with his experience as a former chemistry teacher provides a convincing explanation to the kid who is lot bigger than Venus. ""Bah, Humbug"" is a Christmas episode created in the spirit of Charles Dickens classic Scrooge. Mr. Carlson decides not to give his staff the Christmas bonus. In a dream brought on by eating one of Johnny Fever's brownies, the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future visit him and show how things were ion the past and how it will be in the future. Jennifer, Johnny and Venus appear in his dream. This is a classic episode and I very much enjoyed watching this during the holiday season. Other episodes include the following: In ""Dr. Fever and Mr. Tide (1 and 2)"" Johnny is forced by contractual obligations to host a TV disco dance show in which he adopts the persona of Rip Tide, a sleazy, phony, disco-spinning host. In ""The Airplane Show"" Les does traffic reports from a World War I biplane piloted by a crazy war veteran. The staff helps Jennifer move into her new $125,000 house in ""Jennifer Moves"" episode. The ""Real Families"" episode features Herb's family in a TV show. Daphne Maxwell who guest stars in this show would marry the series actor Tim Reid.

Other episodes are:
""The Baby"" - Mr. Carlson's wife goes into labor and the WKRP staffers all visit the hospital to be there when she gives birth.

""Hotel Ocean view"" - Andy, Mr. Carlson and Herb visit Dayton to try and land the advertising account for Vicky Von Vickey jeans.

""A Mile in My Shoes"" - When Herb is called for jury duty, Andy takes over as sales manager and soon discovers just how tough the job is.

""Baby, It's Cold Inside"" - On a day when the furnace has broken down, Mama Carlson pays a surprise visit to the station and catches Johnny drinking in the broadcast booth.

""The Painting"" - At Mr. Carlson's church auction, Herb buys a painting that Bailey loves.

""Frog Story"" - Herb has accidentally spray-painted his daughter's pet frog Greenpeace pink.

""I Am Woman"" - When it is announced that the Flimm Building is to be torn down, Bailey starts a campaign to have the building declared a Cincinnati landmark.

""Secrets of Dayton Heights"" - The secret service refuses to grant Les credentials for a Presidential press conference, suspecting him of having radical affiliations.

""Out to Lunch"" - Herb's three-martini business lunches with an ad agency representative are causing him to mess up even more than usual.

""A Simple Little Wedding"" - In honor of their twenty-fifth anniversary, Arthur and Carmen Carlson plan to get married again.

""Till Debt Do Us Part"" - When Johnny learns that his first ex-wife is planning to remarry, he is overjoyed at the thought of not having to pay alimony.

""Clean Up Radio Everywhere"" - A local; pastor who calls himself head of the organization Clean Up Radio Broadcasting (CURB) ask the station to stop playing certain songs

7113332,4,B00VX223UY,"Just got through watching the whole Shout! Factory box set.  Amazing how many songs they were able to get...very few missing from this set.  As for Season 3...it starts out a little rough.  Of the entire series, the first 7 episodes of season 3 are probably the only one's I don't care to see again.

Les and the airplane, Jennifer's new house, Real Families (a Herb family episode), Johnny and the old lady at the hospital, Bah Humbug (which they make fun of shows that do Dickens flashbacks, then they go right ahead and do it anyway). The writing seemed a little tired.

The season gets better...but still has weak moments...Herb's alcohol problem, Johnny Fever goes disco, etc.  I'd suggest getting the full box set, or save season 3 until last.  The other seasons are fantastic.  WKRP is definitely a classic and Shout! Factory did a great job putting this together.  The picture quality is a little lower than what you see on Season 1 on Netflix, but Netflix doesn't use any original music and that ruins the show more than a less than sharp picture.",1452643200,,1056,4.634408602150538

8711564,5,B00VX223UY,"WKRP in Cincinnati rocks on in season three. For the time that it aired in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was one of most unique shows around.  It was the rare breed of comedy that seemed to ask the question Whose the straight man? Because theres an old saying in comedy that a show has to have a straight man. I guess there are likely candidates (Jennifer, Bailey, Andy), but the writers made sure that they had their quirks as well.

As a show, it felt like the less competent employees of the radio station overcame the best efforts of the stations competent employees, which leads to a lot of the shows hilarity. I cant say this with a lot of todays comedies, but I actually laughed out loud because the jokes are real and organic based out of the actions of the characters rather than just the easy or crude laugh based on sexual innuendo or the well duh punchline.",1524182400,,874,4.355828220858895
