8622542,5,B00GF0CVJ2,"I agree with the previous reviews. Not the best picture quality. But we all appreciate the recordings of Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, and Rocky Marciano. If you love Mike Tyson then you will love this complete set of Mike Tyson. I love it because I truly appreciate boxing History! Its worth every Penny. Money well spent.",1438473600,,332,4.741379310344827
8622543,2,B00GF0CVJ2,my packman collection had a few good fights but this Tyson collection did not contain fights. only pre talk to the fights. I looked for hours fast forwarding through disc after disc only to find that there was no fight.  bonus cd of pacman vs mayweather actual fight makes it a 2 star instead of 1.,1433548800,,298,4.321428571428571

8622545,5,B00GF0CVJ2,"17 DVD collection of all of Mike Tyson's fights.  Many of them are VHS recordings of network and pay-per-view broadcasts transferred to DVD, which is fine with me.  The Tyson vs. Marvis Frazier fight alone was worth the cost of the entire set to me.  Includes extras about the life of Mike Tyson and his relationship with legendary trainer, Cus D'Amato.  Priceless.",1412899200,6,365,4.838709677419355
