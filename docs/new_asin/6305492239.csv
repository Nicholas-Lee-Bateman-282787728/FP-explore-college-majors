1036651,5,6305492239,"Every now and then I feel the urge to watch Sigmund & the Sea Monsters. The show, which aired on Saturday mornings from 1973-1975, enjoys a simple premise. Basically, after he's kicked out by his nasty family (surname Ooze), Sigmund, who is a friendly sea monster, runs away to the beach. There he is befriended by Johnny and Scott, two nice kids who take Sigmund home with them and hide him in their clubhouse.

Week after week, you could expect the same plot with a few variations to keep things interesting. Basically, that means Johnny (played with aplomb by child actor Johnnie Whitaker, who is best known for his role as Jody on Family Affair) and Scott would try to keep Sigmund's presence a secret from other people (like their housekeeper Zelda) and Sigmund's nasty brothers, Burp and Slurp, who are constantly trying to find him and bring him home.

The show is especially cool because it is a testament to the oddness and tackiness of the Seventies. Check out the clothes, the slang and the pop culture references. Each episode ends with a song (penned by Boyce & Hart, writers of most of the Monkees hits) sung by Johnny. Were they trying to fashion a music career for him?

Either way, the show is well worth checking out if you like Saturday morning TV from the Seventies or if you just want to have fun.",1113264000,2,1318,4.576271186440678
