7898760,2,6305989427,"If not for the solid role of Richard Boone, this would definitely be a one star flick.  Leslie Caron walked through her role and the plot was slow, thin and predictable.  I love westerns and this one was very weak.  The storyline has a nun who is the only survivor of a Indian attack meeting a aged gunfighter who is fleeing from four bad guys who he has evidently double crossed or something  and the gunfighter agrees to take the nun to where she is going.  Toss in a group of Indians who also want him dead and a unlikely budding romance and you have the story. -- The storyline looks good on paper, but did not transfer well to the screen.  If you are a Richard Boone fan you might enjoy this, but you would be better off with Two Mules for Sister Sarah with Clint Eastwood and Shirley MacLaine.",1428969600,,799,4.258278145695364

7898762,5,6305989427,"42 years later, and I still can't get the haunting title theme out of my mind; ""Till Love Touches Your Life"", sung on the original soundtrack by Jan Daley and again by Richard Williams.  I have enjoyed this western since I first saw it, and I think Richard Boone and Leslie Caron do a great job with background music from Riz Ortolani (composed the award-winning ""More"").",1349136000,,371,4.621212121212121
7898763,2,6305989427,"Madron is directed by Jerry Hopper who co-adapts the screenplay with Edward Chappell from a story written by Leo McMahon. It stars Richard Boone, Leslie Caron and Gabi Amrani. Filmed in Israel and Hollywood, cinematography is by Marcel Grignon and Adam Greenbereg and music is by Riz Ortolani.

A nun (Caron) survives a wagon train massacre and teams up with a gunslinger (Boone) in a battle for survival.

I'd like to say that the fact the similar themed Two Mules for Sister Sarah was released the same year is the reason this is little known. But that simply isn't true. For Madron (AKA: His Name Was Madron) is a poor movie, saved from stinker damnation by Boone's fun performance as the grizzled title character. Film consists of Boone and Caron trekking thru the barren sands finding each other as they fight off bandits and injuns in a series of poorly executed action scenes. Script is weak and plot holds no surprises, like wouldn't you know it, once Nun Caron throws off the Habbit, she's a foxy babe! The Israeli vistas hold up as a Western backdrop, but they are barely realised by the photography and the colour is decidedly flat, while the score and title song (Till Love Touches Your Life-Richard Williams & Jan Daley) sounds like something from a soft core porn movie of the 70s. The ending has a decent enough kick to it, and the odd spurt of violence lifts the film out of its stupor; with one scene probably more fitting for Soldier Blue, but really this is only one for Boone enthusiasts. 5/10",1332547200,,1513,4.641791044776119
7898764,4,6305989427,"I initailly saw a lot of reviews that were negative for this film but being a fan of Richard Boone I bought it anyway and really enjoyed it. Boone is of course his usual fiesty self playing that bad boy part but under the poor manners and blunt speech shows himself as a pretty good guy and the viewers is left hoping he will win the girl in the end.
I found this film to be fast paced with interesting characters and of course with the usual cowboy shoot-em-up stuff.",1273104000,,468,4.211111111111111
7898765,1,6305989427,"A very disappointing film starring one of the better western actors. It is such a comedown for Richard Boone of the ""Have Gun Will Travel"" fame. Boone probably did this project because he needs the money or just  becuase he needs to do something. The film is a pathethic and boring excuse  for a western which is neither spaghetti or whatever. It is sad to see a  legend like Boone to take on something trashy as this project. The blurry,  fuzzy, and hazy picture quality is just as bad as the story. I don't  recommend this to anyone including fans of Richard Boone.",954201600,,567,4.466019417475728
