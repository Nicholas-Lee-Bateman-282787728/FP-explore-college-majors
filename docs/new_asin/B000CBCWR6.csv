8096585,4,B000CBCWR6,"I bought this DVD mainly for Farley Granger's 'Behave Yourself', and a delicious bit of fluff it is.  He is very young in this early film, and absolutely adorable.

Granger plays a rather henpecked young husband living in the house of his typically acerbic mother-in-law in LA.  He has a ditzy wife, played to the hilt by Shelley Winters, who is just this side of totally annoying.

They become involved unwittingly with a counterfeit ring and are hounded by the police as well as the gangsters, all played with humor and even flare.

The print is quite decent, and the period LA locations are sublime.",1222732800,,602,4.695238095238095
