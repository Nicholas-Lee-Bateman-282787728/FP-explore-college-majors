7800823,3,1880317753,"This is a very short overview of the Dead Sea Scrolls, but it seems to cover all the essential details: discovery, chronological significance, corroboration of other texts, theory of origin, and wider archaeological significance.  I do agree with the other review that said it would be more appropriate as a short clip to show students rather than as a stand alone documentary, and for all I know maybe that was its intended purpose.  I have taken off a few stars purely because it was so short, but relative to its length (about 8 minutes) it's a good video.  Also, it's narrated by Leonard Nimoy (Spock), and that has to count for something!",1391472000,,643,4.723214285714286
7800824,2,1880317753,The Enigma of the Dead Sea Scrolls is much much better. This is not a good documentary to get super informative info. But I did learn a few new things which is why I'm giving this video 2 stars as opposed to 1. But when I say few I do mean a few. It's a good extremely short documentary for those who pretty much know nothing about the DSS. No documentary is a waste of time unless it's just filled with falsities. It's just basic is all. I would show this to 5th graders because of their attention span and because it's probably safe to assume they know nothing of the DSS.,1372550400,,574,4.133928571428571
7800825,1,1880317753,This movie would not even be worthy as an intro to a full documentary on the scrolls.  They try to make a correlation between a quote from Christ to a quote from the scrolls that is not even remotely similar.,1369440000,,208,4.2
7800826,5,1880317753,"These videos are described well on the Biblical Archaeology site. They are videos of a series of lectures, and not meant to be a travelogue of entertaining photography and sights. The AMAZON description perhaps leaves a lot to the readers imagination. I saw all these videos on the original VHS, and would love to own this set someday. Go to Biblical Archaeology Magazine store for a complete description of these well worth seeing videos.",1310428800,,439,4.945945945945946
7800827,2,1880317753,"Too much lecturing like you're back in school. What they were saying in their lecture was very interesting, however not worth the $50.00 plus paid.

There should have been more on site videos taken at Qumran and the surrounding area that involves
more of the archaeological sites of interest about the Dead Sea Scrolls, I think the dvd would have been much more interesting instead of sitting and watching and listening to 3 dvd's with nothing but lectures by scholars. This became very boring after a while.

Again the information that was provided was real interesting, however, but not 3 dvd's worth of nothing but lecturing.",1295308800,,628,4.915094339622642
