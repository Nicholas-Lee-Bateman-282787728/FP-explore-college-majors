8348304,5,B001ZEHRYM,"Arlen Roth is nothing short of a MONSTER player. 90% of the licks come from the minor pentatonic and blues scale, so if you are comfortable with those scale box-patterns you'll be able to handle the material even if a beginner. Not much detailed explanation, but he plays the lick several times so you'll be able to figure out what he's doing. There is a small booklet included that has tab and notation of the licks. These are very useful licks every guitarist needs in their toolbox. The video moves along briskly as every lick seems to build on the prerious lick. What you realize is these licks were right there under your fingers in the pentatonic/blues scales. It inspires you to really work that scale and figure out ideas of you own. The pentatonic scale has only 5 notes...but the possibilities seem boundless when you watch this DVD. If you are an advanced player or a pro, you know all these licks already...but if you are a beginner or are struggling trying to make music out of the pentatonic scale, you need this DVD in your instructional library.",1432339200,,1061,4.619047619047619

8348306,2,B001ZEHRYM,"phew - why so many good reviews for this. stick w/ you tube and save your money.  Nice for it's time, but it's time is over.  Quality is not good at all.",1419811200,,153,3.75
8348307,4,B001ZEHRYM,"It is a fantastic dvd with alot of GREAT licks. The only reason it's not 5 star is because you can't navigate through the chapters easily. Because it has no interactive menu, you have to manually ff through each chapter.",1405468800,,220,4.525
8348308,5,B001ZEHRYM,"This disc is kind of like a buffet luncheon with lots of goodies to choose from: Some dishes okay, others superb.  This is a good reference to have around.",1389052800,,155,4.344827586206897
8348309,5,B001ZEHRYM,"Most of the ""licks"" DVDs I own have a very limited number of compelling riffs. A 200 licks DVD I bought had maybe 25 that interested me enough so I learned them. Not the case with this Arlen Roth DVD. Most of the 150 licks (presented in about an hour) are worth learning. There isn't much fat on this video -- Roth jumps from one riff to the next without much explanation -- but I consider it more bang for the buck. Each riff is tabbed out in an accompanying booklet, so you can take time away from the video to work them out. Great investment in time and money.",1367280000,3,563,4.127272727272727
