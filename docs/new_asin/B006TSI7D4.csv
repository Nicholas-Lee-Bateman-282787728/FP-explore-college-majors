5016384,5,B006TSI7D4,"Mill Creek is becoming one my favorite entertainment companies out there.  Their products are extremely cheap and they like to get out whole series for us fans.  I love the fact that they average ten episodes a disc on most of their efforts.  Heathcliff: Season 1, Volume 1 is no exception.  Which is really ""Heathcliff And The Catillac Cats.""  A cartoon from the 80's for those who don't know.  For $10 bucks you get 32 episodes of the series.  With Shout Factory you only got 24 episodes and I paid $35 bucks for that set a few years back.  So you get 8 episodes that have not been released here.  Ladies and gentlemen these cartoons have not been remastered at all.  You can tell from the jump.  But they look really good.  This is a bargain folks.  Don't pass up a good buy here.  Mill Creek always gets a bad rap for packaging....etc.  So what.  At these prices I buy most of their cartoons.  Just got ""Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego"" too.  Mill Creek, if you keep cranking them out like this and at this price I'm buying.  At least they are not trying to squeeze every penny they can get out of you.  And that's something I can get behind.",1330387200,13,1148,4.3254716981132075

5016390,5,B006TSI7D4,"Heathcliff was my salvation in the fall of 1984, for I had spent five months in hospitals after getting hit by a car while bicycling. He made me laugh and get over some of the stupid nurses and moronic therapists I had to deal with. Healthcliff put humor back into my life after fate had literally ripped my life out of my hands. Heathcliff also made me see that unless I am happy 24-7, you must change your life and change it...NOW.",1416096000,,433,4.2926829268292686
5016391,5,B006TSI7D4,"The DVD, along with the second volume, both came a few days before the ETA, which surprised me. The DVDs and cases arrived just as advertised and work perfectly. Admittedly, I was a little miffed about how the DVDs were stacked in the case, but that's hardly anything to dwell on, really.

And it's been said several times already, but the issue with the episode ""Young Cat with a Horn"" has indeed been fixed, it was the first episode I went to when it arrived ;)",1414195200,,463,4.383720930232558

5016403,5,B006TSI7D4,"Just wanted to note that my set was purchased on November 17, 2013, and it did not suffer the defect mentioned in some of the reviews. Was relieved to find this out; I hate having to wait for replacements.

The transfers are nothing special, but these cartoons look exactly the same as I remember them from my youth. And that's good enough for me considering I paid a whopping 6 dollars for 32 fun trips down memory lane.

(NOTE: Good idea to check your DVD for the defect when you get it, just in case it's old stock. RealFox's review was helpful to me in locating that specific spot on the DVD)",1385596800,2,596,4.3125
5016404,5,B006TSI7D4,I use to always watch this show when I was a kid and I never get tired of it.  I use to watch it on NF until they rudely removed it in August so when I saw it on Amazon as a recommendation I had to get it.  It is so affordable for 32 episodes.  The packaging is okay although it would have been better if they would have put each disc in its own spindle instead of three paper sleeves.  Anyway it is a great series that no one should miss.,1383264000,,439,3.739130434782609
5016405,5,B006TSI7D4,"i am glad to see more of this series out on DVD.  that is the main point.
this was also acceptably packaged.  not good by any means, but acceptable.  i have other Mill Creek sets that use the same envelope packaging.  thank you for releasing this set.  i will also review the second set on its page.",1380931200,,299,4.175438596491228
5016406,4,B006TSI7D4,"Mill Creek has done good and brought us Heathcliff Season 1 Volume 1. Contains 32 episodes (8 more than the Shout! Factory release but loses the extras and original bumpers so you'll probably want to hang on to that) and a bonus episode of The Get-Along Gang. The transfers are very well by the way. There is however one flaw; On Disc 3, Young Cat With A Horn suffers a defect in which the episode cuts abruptly to another scene in the episode. But there is good news; you can contact Mill Creek regarding this, and they'll send you a replacement disc featuring the corrected version of Young Cat With A Horn (I did and was very happy they did so) albeit on a DVD-R disc. I'm not sure if they plan to do a re-pressing in the future with the corrected version of the episode, but should you buy this and Young Cat With A Horn suffers the defect, contact Mill Creek and they'll send you a replacement as soon as they can. Other than that, the set and the show gets a high recommendation from me (in addition to the fact it stars the legendary Mel Blanc as Heathcliff!).",1378684800,4,1067,4.313432835820896
5016407,5,B006TSI7D4,"Whats there to say, its Heathcliff!! :) Great buy, excellent condition, everytime we watch these, it makes me nostalgic for my Saturday morning cartoons!! :)",1372118400,,157,5.32
5016408,5,B006TSI7D4,I grew up on this show as a kid and watching it as a young adult I must say this still is a great cartoon and never gets old. If your looking for a classic 80s cartoon then this is the one for you plus you the Cadillac cats too how can you beat that.,1366243200,,250,3.5636363636363635
5016409,5,B006TSI7D4,"This DVD is a much better deal than the one that comes with 10 episodes each of Heathcliff, The Littles, and the Get Along Gang. You get 32 episodes for just a few more dollars instead of only 10 episodes. All 10 of the episodes that are on the 3-cartoon DVD are also on this one, so there's no reason to buy the other one if you know you want more than 10 episodes of Heathcliff (unless you just want a handful of Heathcliff and the other two cartoons, or if you want to see a few episodes before deciding if you want to buy the bigger sets). The same is true for The Littles; a DVD set of 29 episodes & 2 movies is available almost as cheap as the 3-cartoon DVD. Back to Heathcliff: about 10 years ago I got a Heathcliff DVD as a prize in a cereal box. It has two episodes, and one of those is not on this 32-episode DVD. I don't know any place to get additional episodes.

Also on this Heathcliff DVD you get a half-hour episode of the Get Along Gang. I'm glad I bought this one instead of the 3-cartoon DVD, because after seeing the Get Along Gang for the first time since I was 4, I decided I didn't like it enough to buy it.

Has anyone had any success with the free game offer that comes with the DVD? There's a code that comes with this & some of this company's other cartoon DVDs (the same code with every DVD) that says ""5 free kids PC games"" from SoftwareOnlyGamescom. The code didn't work for me, & I can't find any contact information for the company. This has nothing to do with the quality of the DVD, of course. I didn't buy it for the games. I just wonder if anyone has been able to get the games.",1360713600,,1614,4.056426332288401

When The Cats go to see the professor, it skips from that point, and past Hector's dream, and right to Him waking from it. I am quite annoyed...",1332374400,7,349,4.147058823529412
