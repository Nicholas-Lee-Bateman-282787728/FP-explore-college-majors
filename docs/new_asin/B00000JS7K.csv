They did a good job with their 'Cartoon Crazy's Goes to War' edition showing some rare classics that haven't been shown on public TV due to their heavy stereotypes of Nazis and Japanese. They also show some old training films drawn for soldiers in WWII. The great thing about this DVD is that all the cartoons are related to 'War' like the title states. It deserves 4 stars. On the other hand, the other DVD included in this set, 'Cartoon Crazy's- SciFi' loosely sticks to it's title. Example: 'Cupid Gets His Man' and 'House Cleaning Blues' and 'John Henry & The Inky Poo'. What a waste. There are a few good superman cartoons on here, but Winstar made 2 DVDs full of Superman cartoons, so just buy those. 1 star for Sci-Fi. So if you can, only get the War edition and skip the Sci-Fi edition.",996451200,,927,4.624242424242424
