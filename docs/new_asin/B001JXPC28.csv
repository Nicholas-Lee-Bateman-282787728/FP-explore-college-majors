3660528,5,B001JXPC28,"How can one not fall in love with a movie that stars a precocious, sweet 9-year old by the name of Buster (Rebecca Smart)? She was the shiralee, the extra burden, around whose life the movie revolved. Her father Macauley (Brian Brown) was the protagonist with most of the scenes, which for in their plurality depicted an egocentric person, more concerned about maintaining his ""independence"" than with his daughter's welfare. Beautiful Lily (Noni Hazlelhurst), Macauley's former girlfriend, offered a needed counterbalance with her love and concern for father and daughter. The movie was not without its faults. It was a bit too heavy with schmaltz in places, giving the project an occasional soap-operatic tone. And the car accident occurred toward the end and out of the blue to become the artificial vehicle for the eventual resolution of all outstanding issues. Regardless. This film fully deserves 5 stars for the storyline, the superb acting, the period setting, and most of all for little Rebecca Smart.",1472428800,,1010,5.164634146341464

As an actor performer, he personified the character exceptionally well, as bad as the character was scripted to be.

I personally saw myself in Bobby Browns character, though not quite as hardened, but certain interactions reminded me at times of particular moments in the past with my daughter, and left me wishing I could go back and deal with things differently.

The little girl is a natural actor and if you don't fall in love with her you aren't human. The music is a little cheesy, but it is typical of the time in which it was filmed.",1434240000,,661,4.28

3660723,2,B001JXPC28,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Not sure if they tamed the Mac character in this version, but what a jerk! It reminded me of Brown in ""Alfie"", selfish, mean, uncaring and brutish. His role in ""Cocktail"" was not much more subdued as well.

I found the sweet loving Buster to be the big hit of the entire 3 PLUS Hour tour of the Oz Bush. The harpey wife was over dramatic, as well as the Aunt Belle scenes. Has anyone seen Luhrman's ""Australia""? I choose that as my reference and in comparison find the reviewed film a rather wasteful celluloid product.

I lived with an Australian for several years, they are the best looking people in the world imho. But this man was a true gent! Although the calls from Pops in Adelaide at 4am were disturbing, all around a great mate. Shout out to Kim!! ;}}

Perhaps the Peter Finch version 30 years prior did justice to the original text and believe Finch to be one of acting's finest. But I have not and the reviews proved either shallow or unhelpful.

I watched this in two settings hoping the lessons learned and character development would ensue. However, only desperation and financial need seemed to drive the main character. ""I will never work for a woman"" declaration might be understandable in that timeframe, but he did have a young child to feed, what a morally bankrupt low life! The flimsy ending did not compensate for the annoying and slow moving drama.

My initial reason to see this film was the hope of seeing the outback and it's native culture. Perhaps there was ONE aboriginal walk-on that was marginalized in a local Fair scene, but that was it. Given this was actually filmed in Australia, the vast continent's beauty was eclipsed by poor dialogue. Alas, dirt roads that led to nowhere was the height of the tourist trap.

I gingerly recommend for Bryan Brown fans but assume no redeeming qualities provided. At the least, I am aware of what Shiralee means.",1425340800,,1927,4.616959064327485
3660754,5,B001JXPC28,"My husband and I loved this movie. It was a love story about a dad (Mac) and his daughter (Buster). Mac really didn't want to be a daddy and acted like he didn't care much about anything. He didn't want to care about Buster but he had a heart, even though it seemed as though he didn't at times. Buster knew her daddy's ""bark"" was much worse than his ""bite"". Even though Mac was rough around the edges, and it seemed he was just flat mean to his daughter - she knew he cared about her. She was winning his heart and he already had her heart. Sometimes those are the best kind of people because they really do care, way more than someone who acts like they care and seemingly do all the right things. For the most part, you can't fool kids, and Mac's gruff behavior did not fool Buster. I know this movie was fictional, but I've lived long enough to have seen some people much like Mac and Buster - for real. The actors were very good, but the little girl that played Buster was outstanding. I gave this movie 5 stars because there are very few movies that have touched me like this one.",1425168000,,1086,4.2009569377990434

3660840,4,B001JXPC28,"Stumbled upon this DVD set at the library and took the risk because it takes place in the outback of Australia and has Bryan Brown in it. I've been a Bryan Brown fan since I saw him in A Town Like Alice (80's Masterpiece Theater). He was great and  Rebecca Smart (Buster) was amazing!  Where did they find her?  Yes, as others have said, he was a despicable, wretched father, but the journey he takes with her transforms him, saves him really.  As other reviewers have mentioned it has a slow pace, which seems to me to mirror what the essence of a walkabout is all about, and so I was not bothered by it. I am not sure I would call this a family film; maybe for older children and if a parent wants to engage in conversation about some of the themes. Four stars for being very good.",1409184000,,783,4.2
3660841,1,B001JXPC28,"This movie is demeaning and dismal. I certainly do NOT recommend it for a family movie. There's bad language and sexual insinuations throughout the movie. It's distressing because of the little girl being forcefully taken from her mother by her father (because after months away from home the father finally comes home to find his wife with another man). I agree that the mother didn't deserve the little girl because she put liquor in her daughter's drink so she could commit adultery without the little girl knowing. Nevertheless, in my humble opinion, the father was no better and treated the little girl badly. I didn't return the movie for my money back - I just trashed it (that's how bad I think it is).",1407715200,,710,4.733870967741935

I showed it to my students so many times that I wore it out over a ten year span. I looked for it on the PBS site - they did not have it. Then I looked on the internet and found the version done in the European TV standard that won't work here in the US. Evidently the Aussies are on the European standard since this was originally shot in Australia. The quality of the video is not up to today's standards. Hence the 4 star rating. It needs to be remastered because it is not nice and crisp. However, having said all of this, the story itself is very compelling with an excellent cast. It always makes me gushy to watch how Brian Brown who plays Macauley grows to love his daughter Buster (Rebecca Smart).

It's based on a novel by Australian author D'Arcy Niland, who I guess must be an Aussie equivalent of Canada's W.O. Mitchell or maybe America's John Steinbeck. The casting and acting is wonderful, the characters real, and if I have to criticize anything, it would be picture quality, but hey -- the picture was filmed in 1987 -- and a little fuzziness is easy to ignore with such a great tale. I recommend this for everyone. It's a lovely and memorable film. I saw a few minutes of it 20 years ago, and the scene stayed with me all this time.",1358035200,,657,4.576271186440678

 And I found it! And I ordered it. And this turned up. So what's the conclusion? If they're right then I must be going insane, suffering from hallucinations and dementia....  But I don't think so.

 Anyway, this movie: it's okay. But it is not a patch on the original (black and white, 1957) Peter Finch version. Just the characters - Bryan Brown is an entirely different character to Peter Finch.  And the Shiralee entirely different.

I searched the web many times for a copy of the series and was thrilled to find it finally available.  Bryan Brown who is the lead plays a complicated but rather typical male chauvanist Australian man with a heart of gold and very high standards for himself and the women he will let into is life.  The child Buster is brilliantly played by Rebecca Smart who almost steals the show but without each other this story would have no meaning.  It is an ""on the road again"" story, tramping over the dusty country side the father looking for work and his daughter walking along side him.  It is an adventure story in a way but does leave you hanging as you wonder how in the future the life of both will develop.  This is not a fast paced movie but rather it slowy compells you to read on or as in this case watch on.",1265328000,,958,4.151351351351352

3660910,2,B001JXPC28,"We bought this dvd set, remembering a sweet tale that we had seen years ago on the Disney channel (called ""McCauley's Daughter""), about a tough man learning to appreciate his little daughter, as they trudged the Outback together.  We were a bit puzzled by the fact that this dvd was termed a ""mini-series"", as we only remembered a MOVIE that seemed about 2 hours long.  After only watching the first disc of the set, we got rid of the whole thing.  It was so full of the ""seedy"" side of life, that we were dismayed to be sitting there watching it with our children.  We had known that the Disney channel often edited their ""nightime"" movies but we didn't realize that they had edited this one so much as to take out nearly half the mini-series, thus removing half of the story!

As we found on the first disc, the story is basically this:  when ""Mac Macauley's"" first attempt at the ""love of his life"" is thwarted, he joins a carnival and, finding out that his ""love"" is married some years later, he marries a carny girl for whom he has no regard.  After leaving her and their only child alone for months at a time, he returns to find his wife is unfaithful (big suprise).  He throws a hissy fit, takes their daughter, ""Buster"", and leaves.  He begins to drag his little girl everywhere across the Outback, as he searches for work, often treating her very bitterly, and not giving a thought to the situations he puts her in.  The poor little girl is reduced to a pawn in the war between two very selfish adults, as Mac and his ex try to figure out how to get revenge on each other.

We were so looking forward to getting this DVD because of what we had seen on the Disney channel, that it was quite a shock to find all of the ""details"" of a ""seemy"" life exposed.  Editing can change a story quite a bit, as we found out.  We LOVED the music and Australian scenery and chuckled at the feisty ""Buster""; but we wish that the movie had been what we saw on the Disney channel.  We could have really enjoyed it.",1254960000,,2005,4.312
3660911,5,B001JXPC28,"In the same awesome landscape beauty of ""Rain Shadow"" this DVD, ""The Shiralee"", will touch your senses and then your emotions.  Again, like ""Rain Shadow"", the action takes place down-under, in the Australian outback.  This time the story lead is a rough Aussie bloke, rather than a female vet.  Byran Brown (from the recent 2008 movie ""Australia"") plays ""Mac"" Macauley. His manner is backwoods-bush, but his performance is 5-star.  He will evoke just about every emotion from hatred to love as he takes on life wildly and eventually the responsibility of a 9-year old daughter.  Don't cross Mac, he packs a mean punch, often.

Lily (Noni Hazlehurst)is his true love, from first sight, but alas, do you know how hard it is to hang on to good love in the outback? Tough, like the country, like the men. Lily is tough too.

The wonderful star and joy of ""the Shiralee"" is Buster, the child of Mac, played by Rebecca Smart.  What a great job by a young girl.  Buster is the Pollyanna of the Outback.  Like Dorothy of Oz, she takes on life in her own way, tough if needed, sweet often, and in love with her dad--no matter what.  Her smile is as wide as the Australian bush horizon.  How dare Mac consider Buster a Shiralee (burden).

What a delight to find this story on film.  Acorn has done a wonderful job of presentation.  OK, one negative, no English sub-titles for us blokes that can't catch all of the down-under slang and dialect.  But it's not a huge problem. Use reverse if needed. It is sure not worth turning your back on this delightful and heartwarming tale of father and daughter.

It's not your normal ""Father Knows Best"" 40s/50s story of Dad and girl. Actually, Mac has a hard time taking care of Buster since his desire and ambition is walking the road and roaming for work and a livelihood.  He takes his daughter to spite his wife, and has to learn parenthood on the road.  Many time he relates to Buster miserably. At these points, Mac deserves the viewers rage and hate. Mac is just to tough on Buster, to lacking of empathy.  Mac shows almost no love or tender emotion to the young child. Boo, Hiss, for the dad. Then, Buster will chew on him a bit, smile wide, and all is well for a few more dusty kilometers on the road.

Before the 3+ hours are over, you will begin to wonder why you bothered watching the nasty, beastly-dad, Mac.  But don't give up, enjoy the drama, the scenery, and eventually you'll come to find out why this is a 5-STAR film, worthy of the $$$ and time.

There is absolutely no reason why someone can't write a sequel.  D'Arcy Niland wrote the novel.  ""Siralee"" (Aussie slang for ""burden"") leaves the viewer with their own Siralee. No more segments of hardships to overcome for this ""Odd-couple road pair"".

I recommend buying. Then, consider ""Rain Shadow.""",1235520000,,2799,4.559118236472946
