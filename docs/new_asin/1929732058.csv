An outstanding and picturesque portrayal of the tender loving and enduring spirit of children. I highly recommend this movie. It is a wonderful movie for all ages. It is really SAD that the movie industry won't make it available on DVD or Blu-Ray.",1455840000,,400,5.075757575757576

7801297,4,1929732058,"This is a terrific little film, one that is appropriate for all ages, and one that deserves a wider audience.

It should be released on DVD!  Considering all the crap that gets released on DVD, it is a shame that a little gem like this is ignored, and isn't readily available.  Shame, shame on the studio that released it for not giving it the audience it deserves!",1282348800,4,365,4.417910447761194
7801298,5,1929732058,"I've watched this movie a few times and it's truly wonderful. The cast is charming and loaded with talent (especially the children). Helen Shaver's character is especially inspiring and well done. She plays an extremely hard-working woman who has been dealt a very difficult hand. Instead of moping and whining and bitterly lamenting her fate (like most of us would), she quietly summons her strength and gets through each demanding day with dignity, courage and a deep love for her children. Great viewing experience for the entire family.

Why is there no DVD?",1123632000,9,562,5.043010752688172
7801299,5,1929732058,"Never under estimate the power of animals. When two goats accidently get together and bring a two completly different families together it is an amazing story of laughter, sadness, tragidy and togetherness. A movie that  everyone should see as a family. The story of love, hate, disrespect and  respect. A must see movie.",963792000,5,321,5.037735849056604
