7041608,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"I have enjoyed this movie ever since my first viewing of it when it was in theaters I pre-ordered the DVD and received it in the mail the same day it came out. I actually bought 3 of them. 1, I had sent as a gift to my aunt who lives all the way up in Montana, 1, also as a gift for my sister, and 1 for my own collection!!!!!!!!!!! This is another great family friendly sports movie done by Disney that is right up there with other Disney family friendly sports movies such as, ""Invincible"", ""The Rookie"", ""Miracle"", ""Cool Runnings"", and who could ever forget ""Remember the Titans"", etc.. This movie is what I call a ""NEW"" Disney Classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith",1426118400,,675,4.495934959349594
7041609,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"Jim White (Kevin Costner) is a football coach whose luck and temperament has lead him to McFarland, the last stop. He moves his family into the Hispanic community and instructs kids who are ""invisible and expendable."" His daughter asks, ""Are we in Mexico?"" After watching some of the kids run, he decides to form a cross country team, which initially shows little support from the community. As Jim and his family give back to the community and strive to understand them, they discover a community who is family and supportive as his family becomes one of them.

Yes this is another true Cinderella story. We know how they end, or else they would have never made the film. This one doesn't involve basketball, football, or AP calculus, which makes it a bit dry. The community drama was minimal, as it would be in real life, and Costner would not have been in my top 10 people to play Jim White.

It is a feel good film based on a true story suitable for most families.",1425945600,2,968,4.525714285714286
7041610,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"McFarland, USA is one of the best and most inspiring based on a tru story movies I have seen. I have literally watched this movie again and again and again and never get tired of it. The acting is superb and everything about this movie feels entirely authentic. The culture and the era of the people and the place that this movie represents are spot on. It is beyond heartwarming and will literally make you stand up and cheer, and possibly even cry a little. This is definitely one of Disney's unsung heroes when it comes to live action films.",1533081600,,544,4.45

7041614,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"I love these type of movies, when there's an inspiring teacher in a school that needs someone to believe in the underserved/underrepresented students. And I love it even more because McFarland is just a short drive away from my birth/home town (Porterville)!
Side Note: the story line of this coach is not exactly as it happened in the movie. I recommend you look it up after watching the movie.",1531353600,,395,4.739130434782608

This being a true story makes it even better.  I'm glad that this movie was made.  We drove through McFarland earlier this year and saw the school with adjacent prison.  This small little town with championship years painted on the school's walls acknowledging their achievements and showing their pride of ""underdog"" power!

This movie has so much to say, so many  varied important messages, yet every SECOND is thoroughly entertaining.

I saw it while visiting, and knew I had to have it for my permanent collection, to be re-enjoyed over and over again. I ordered my own copy that same evening.

Based on a true story, it condensed 9 years of experience into a single season.  That's the sort of ""dramatic license"" I can live with.",1523145600,,439,4.506329113924051

7041675,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"Kevin Costner plays Jim White, a teacher and cross-country coach at a mostly Latino high school in McFarland, California, based on a true story and set in the 1987-1988 school year.  There is a minor tendency towards schmaltz and over-length (15 to 20 minutes should have been trimmed), as well as some undernourished dialogue, and as in other movies based on true stories, there are the expected tweaks to the Hollywood story line.  But what prevails is an undeniable sense of unity, loyalty, brotherhood, and, most of all, hope, sure to be a favorite in the underdog genre and easily living up to Disney studio standards and expectations (in fact, there is an underdog member within the underdog team itself, which I will not give away).

An adult who comes to this movie for the first time will recognize that they are being hit over the head with hackneyed cliches and propaganda, but is likely to enjoy the movie anyway.",1508284800,,575,4.58252427184466

7041715,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"""That's not Danny Diaz!""
Some of my college cross country teammates and I went to go see this movie when it came out and loved it. Very inspirational movie about a ragtag bunch of kids who put a small California town on the map through their incredible running ability. It was filmed on location, and you can drive around McFarland past the high school, the convenience store, the prison, and the neighborhoods to get a feel for everything. There may be better running origin stories out there but to this is the one Disney made a movie of. I've always enjoyed the Disney sports movies and this one is no exception. Helps that I'm also a runner! Great movie and recommend it to anyone, runner or not, for some inspiration to not only work hard and never give up, but to also not judge people on where they came from.",1504137600,,816,4.446666666666666

7041740,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"Review of McFarland, USA
Hot Toasty Rag, June 18, 2017

The synopsis of this movie will probably make you think its a cheesy Disney movie about a washed up teacher who makes a difference to his bad-boy students. Its not that movie. Its a fantastic, moving, inspiring tale that youll want to buy and add to your collection.

Kevin Costner plays a fired high school football coach with nowhere else to go but McFarland, USA, the poorest town in America in 1987. The kids there have no hope and no motivation, because before and after school they're out in tomato or lettuce fields helping their parents pick produce. Theyre not going to college; theyll become pickers when they graduate.

Costner sees his kids running after school and comes up with the idea of creating a cross country team. With no funding, no support, and no clue what hes doing, he starts training the kids.

The cross country portions of the film are exciting and fun to watch, but theres a lot more to this movie than the plot I just outlined. Costner and his family learn to make their new house their home, and this half of the film is interesting, tension-filled, and heartwarming. Its terribly sad to see the state of the town and how the poor residents survive, when the rest of America is thriving. Costners character is unaware of their struggle when he first arrives, as most of the viewers will be, but as he gets to know his neighbors and bonds with the community, he (and we) are exposed to their cultural traditions.

If you're not drawn to the movie because of the sports, or the inspirational story, or because you like true stories, or you like Kevin Costner, Ill give you one more reason to watch it: Maria Bellos costumes. Ive never seen her look so pretty, and she wears the most darling outfits!

But seriously, watch McFarland, USA. Its incredibly moving to watch how one teacher impacted a community and inspired a group of boys to look higher up than an agricultural field.",1498262400,,1966,4.6189111747851

7041742,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"This movie tells a really good and heartwarming story about an actual cross-country team in McFarland (central CA), their coach, played by Kevin Costner, their personal and competitive challenges, and how they, individually and collectively, prevailed and succeeded.

You really find yourself rooting for the characters to succeed and feel that they are not just forgotten because of who they are and where they live.  The movie is a reminder that having family & friends that love you, encourage you, and believe in you is more important than any success that one can get from money or job titles.  It also shows that just when we think we are teaching something to others, we discover in the process that we are actually learning much more valuable things from them.",1471392000,,585,4.490566037735849

7041978,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"Based on a true story, McFarland's young actors are believable in their roles as adolescent high school student- athletes who must also work long hours as farm pickers, along side their parents. The film was purchased to be shown to middle school, inner-city students, in an inclusive setting, for a Movie and Debate class. It is a coming of age story for every character in the movie - kids and adults alike. Racial issues are some what sugar coated, but the messages are clear. Not surprisingly, students who have viewed the film identified with the young heroes , but also discovered some compassion, and possibly understanding, of the adult dilemmas, as well.

7042048,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"Loved this movie!

This movie is a nice, uplifting movie about persevering and overcoming!  It is also about opening your eyes and seeing things from a different perspective.

I was worried about this being yet another movie where a white teacher goes and saves a bunch of brown-skinned kids. It is KIND OF like that, but I think the kids in this case also save the teacher.  Plus, with it being based on a true story, it makes it much less bothersome.  And honestly, there are movies where the Black coach saves the Black kids (Coach Carter), though it is easy to forget those.

This was a good movie to show to my high school students.  We talked about the quinceaera scene, about stereotypes that are shown and changed in the movie and about farmworkers, leading into the discussion of their working conditions and pay, as well as a bit about modern-day slavery.

One thing I REALLY liked about the movie is at the end, it gives you and update about where the members of the team are now (well, at the time the movie was released).

Excellent, clean movie that you can show to middle or high schoolers, cover items on the curriculum and not worry about it being inappropriate.",1466640000,5,1179,4.549763033175355

7042210,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"I was talking to my Ace-Reviewer sister recently and she told me that this film was a gem that had to be seen. Kevin Costner was outstanding she said. The story was heartfelt and inspiring. It was her FAVORITE of the Disney Sports films! Whoa.

Favorite of the Disney Sports films is high praise indeed considering how great some of them have been in recent years. ""From Remember The Titans"" to ""Miracle"", Disney has put out some outstanding films in the trappings of Sports stories. So when I say that this truly is one of, if not THE best...yeah you need to see it. The Greatest Game Ever Played was the best golf movie I've ever seen. And this film actually does the same for Running in my book (Sorry ""Chariots of Fire"").

Yes, Kevin Costner is so solid in this film he's actually amazing. As in far more Oscar-worthy than Sandra Bullock in ""The Blindside"". But there is SO much more to this film than that. There is some truly great direction in this film. To the point of Best-Director Nomination worthy. No, there is no ultra-violence-sexual-coming-of-age-lifetime-achievement-Hollywood-favorite-political-message-of-the-moment scene to be found in this film. There's no head-hurting-stomach-churning-morality-twisting-drama that usually gets the Oscar nod. Heck there's not even any flashy cinematography. What there is, is a BEAUTIFULLY understated craftsmanship that lets the incredible script and outstanding acting throughout unfold the story.

There's laugh-out-loud moments of hilarity to be found, there's a strong undercurrent of the dislike people have of living, working, BEING somewhere they feel is beneath them, for the very human reasons that no one needs spelled out.

I've LIVED in a neighborhood where there were sirens every night, gunshots, barking dogs and screams (and so many drug dealers on my street I almost couldn't get into my own driveway), in the very same place where I made life-long friends and got TWO giant going away cards signed by countless families. I spent time with snobs who treated me like dirt around the same time, in a place that many people thought was a better world (and where my black friend got the cops called on him for preaching in a white neighborhood). I even preached in neighborhoods that were mere miles from fields farmed by immigrants (I drove through roads next to those fields when I went to college to get my degree). And yes, I do have Hispanic blood and LOOK like I belong in those fields myself if I get a bit of sun (hilariously I've been called ""a white boy"", ""Italian"" and ""Mexican"" depending on how much sun exposure I get), and I spent my teen years doing construction work for my dad with his Mexican workers (as my sister pointed out, the only people TOUGH enough to handle working on his crew) under the hot California sun. What am I saying, this film hit me close to home on a number of levels.

Getting back to this film, having spent so much time in areas like it's setting, it feels absolutely authentic. All of the drama, the humor, the subtle romance, the cynicism, and ultimately the triumph, feels very, very real. The film is so well paced, acted, directed, and written, that it's entertaining from start to finish, and deeply moving in a way I haven't felt since ""Stand And Deliver"".

The other reviewers are absolutely correct. This film is a good family film. It's an incredible story. It's moving, it's funny, it's feel good. It's a movie for people who like sports films, and even moreso for people who don't. It should be shown in every Middle School ESPECIALLY in California. And it is absolutely worth owning and watching repeatedly.

This is not just a great sports film. It is one of the best films to come out in the last ten years. Essential purchase.",1460764800,,3754,4.838006230529595

7042333,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"New Zealand director Niki Caro (Whale Rider North Country, A Heavenly Vintage) adds another success to her resume with this moving portrayal of a true story about a coach and his team in 1987 overcoming odds and learning trust, hope, and a belief in attainable goals.  Based on a story by Bettina Gilois and Christopher Cleveland who also wrote the screenplay with Grant Thompson, the film may be overly long, but the emotional impact is so strong that the viewer stays with every minute of it without lapses.

The year is 1987 and Jim White (Kevin Costner) moves his wife (Maria Bello) and two daughters (Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher) after losing his last job as a football coach because of anger management related causes. McFarland, CA is in the San Joaquin Valley, an agricultural community that is basically populated with migrant workers who make their living form harvesting crops (it is one of the poorest cities in the country). He is at the end of his rope, feeling that this assignment is his only hope for supporting his family. He struggles, fails as a football coach but gets the idea of having a cross-country track team when he observes the stamina of the young lads running after being up early to pick crops. He turns seven students with no hope into one of the best cross-country teams, learning as much about equality and fulfillment of goals as his runners do.

In addition to the interpersonal reactions among the students and Jims family (his friends create a Quinceaera for Jims 15 year old daughter) there are many moments of inspiring beauty in this radiant film  not the least of which is a letter written by one of the runners: We fly like blackbirds through the orange groves, floating on a warm wind. When we run, we own the earth. The land is ours. We speak the birds' language. Not immigrant no more. No stupid Mexicans. When we run, our spirits fly. We speak to the gods. When we run, we are the gods.

This is a moving film, so very timely during this struggle with border problems and immigration and racial distrust. Films like this serve a purpose far greater than mere entertainment. Grady Harp, December 15",1451433600,2,2148,4.687002652519894

7042340,5,B00UI5CU6Y,This is a well made film that shows how kids from immigrant families get to surpass all of their struggles to become the best runners in California and eventually land good careers after university. It's often that kids from immigrant families get left in the dust and are destined to work hard jobs in the vegetable fields like their parents so it's very inspiring every time I see or hear about an example where they succeed and prove everyone wrong.,1451088000,,452,4.6625

7042393,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"McFarland USA is based on the true story of coach Jim White (who is white)  leading an all-Latino cross-country running team in a small California town to a state championship.  Director Niki Caro does as well with this story as she did with the 2002 film, Whale Rider, made in her native New Zealand.  Kevin Costner is fine as the coach and the Latino actors, plus many members of the McFarland community where it was filmed, make it a moving story.  The film combines the satisfaction of the underdog making good against the odds with a closeup visit with the warm Latin culture of those who work dusk to dark in the fields of California providing us with fresh food.

7042402,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"All one can wish for with this movie is for it to be longer.  That's not to imply that it's too short or that the story feels incomplete, but more so that you are on the edge of your seat for more.  More about the lives of these kids, the impact of their coach on them and the community.  I sat there begging ""show me more"".  The story isn't just about these kids amazing accomplishments as runners.  It's about overcoming adversity, will power, inner strength, family, culture, community, growth, defeating societal labels, societal able-ism, family, the impact a few can have on many, the crossing of ethnic norms to assimilate the ""American Dream"" in the strength of the ethnic social network, the redefinition of the ""American Dream"", of not taking handouts but working hard
to achieve, survival.
In this day and age, everyone can grow from watching this movie.  And don't watch it once.  Watch it, absorb and process what you experienced and learned.  Then watch it again to experience it again.

This is one movie on a long list of movies that should be a mandatory part of a ""Power, Privilege, and Individuality"" curriculum that should be part of every education program.  A curriculum that is expanded upon each year, K-12.

Common Core? It may work based on the research of a few.  But education needs a more experiential component, a curriculum as described above will promote academically ""standardized"" students who enter the world as more culturally competent and compassionate members of our communities.

I write this from the perspective of a graduate level counseling student in a program that continually promotes cultural competency, recognition of individuality,ethic sensitivity.  It may seem that those components are part of every counselor or therapist or doctor or nurse.  But they aren't.",1447286400,,1814,5.0200668896321075

7042436,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"This film  based on the real life story of coach Jim White, and the Mexican American cross country runners from McFarland, California, whom he coached to a California state championship in 1987, followed by several more in subsequent years. It is an uplifting Disney film, which should be enjoyed by anyone who has run cross country, has an interest in the sport, or of the hard life of Latino farm laborers in California and elsewhere.
But there are aspects of the film which are misleading or simply untrue, for the sake of artistic license I guess. I will discuss these after summarizing the plot (Warning: Spoiler alert).
The film begins in 1987 with Coach White and his Boise high school football team at half time of a dismal game where his team is more focused on partying after the game than the game itself. After the team captain sneers at White, he throws a football cleat in his direction, accidentally hurting the player, and in the next scene we see White and his family packing to move to McFarland, a small town in the central valley of California close to Bakersfield, consisting almost entirely of Mexican American farm laborers. It is certainly a culture shock for the Whites, and Coach White tells his wife they will move to another town as soon as possible.
White begins his new job at McFarland high school where in addition to teaching life sciences and physical education, he is to assist the football coach. White soon falls out with the coach, however, as he refuses to let a scrawny football player who had been hit hard go back on the field. He is not fired but relieved of his coaching duties. As PE teacher, though, he notices some of his students are quite fast when running laps, including that scrawny football player. He persuades the principal to let him form a cross country team.
White manages to recruit seven members for the team, just enough to qualify them for competition (in cross country meets, the scores are tallied by adding together the top five places for each team, with the lowest score winning; only the top seven runners can displace members of opposing teams). They are full of hope, but at their first meet, described as the Palo Alto Invitational held in October 1987, they place last and also encounter racism and snobbery from their competitors, even the coaches, especially from Palo Alto high school, who are portrayed as spoiled rich white kids. The film shows only four teams competing in only one race at this event.
White recognizes that one of their weaknesses is a lack of hill training, so he incorporates that into their training, running up and down huge mounds of tightly plastic wrapped almond shells (about 20 feet high) in the farm fields.
During the course of the film White endears himself not only with his runners but also with the Mexican American farm community. In one notable scene, White tries to persuade the Diaz family to let their three sons run on the team by offering to work in the fields besides them one day. The parents had been reluctant to let their sons participate because they needed their field work in order to put food on the table. White soon realizes how hard the work is, and practically collapses in the field. But everyone appreciates his effort. The Diaz sons stay on the team. After another race, he drives his team to the beach, a first for them to see the ocean, in order to celebrate
In another very touching scene, the neighbors organize an elaborate ""quinceanera"" evening party for his daughter's 15th birthday. At the end of the party, she is driven in an impromptu parade of cars, in which she is accompanied by White's star runner (who is quite infatuated with her), but it all comes to a screeching halt when another group of car (low) riders encounters them and a violent altercation ensues. Fortunately she is not hurt, but White decides at that point that the family has to leave town, so he travels to the hated Palo Alto high school, for a job interview as head cross country coach. His runners find out, which causes some friction, but he is noncommittal and in the pep talk before the state cross country championship he tells them as field workers, they are tougher and have endured far more hardships than their opponents and thus inspires them to go out and win. Following the victory he quietly walks over to the Palo Alto coach and tells him he is staying with McFarland.. The epilogue shows how many state cross country championships McFarland won in subsequent years and in the final scene we see the real life Jim White riding his bike alongside his jogging runners from the class of 1987, now for the most part successful adults living in McFarland.
Now for some corrections in the real life narrative:
Jim White did not come to McFarland in 1987, he came there after graduating from Pepperdine University in 1964. As with the film character, White did not have prior experience coaching cross country or running but unlike the film, he began coaching McFarland cross country in 1980, not 1987. It is very unrealistic to expect any team to rise from nothing into state champions within a few months. In one of the interviews I read it seems that his team was running 80 miles a week during off-season, which is consistent with a team developing into state champions over a few years. The cross country team had also existed before 1980, perhaps under a different coach, stopped for a year, and then revived under coach White. But he coached both boys and girls cross country teams and his teams were larger than shown on the film. The girls team is entirely missing in the film, but pictures of both teams at that time can be found at a website of a photographer. See: https://johnhartephoto.wordpress.com//twinkies-hawaii-and/ and https://johnhartephoto.wordpress.com//a-glimpse-at-the-re/
The Palo Alto Cross Country Invitational meet depicted in the film is nothing like what actually took place. In this meet. Similar to other invitational meets, hundreds of runners participated with at least 30 or 40 teams and many divisions, for both boys and girls. McFarland was not at the 1987 meet, but that is understandable because it is in the central valley, about a four hour drive from Palo Alto. There were likely similar meets closer to home it could have attended.
The depiction of Palo Alto runners as a bunch of spoiled country club kids making racist insults is certainly untrue. I lived in Palo Alto in the 1950s (moving 20 miles north to Burlingame at age 10 in 1960). The typical house in my neighborhood was one story, two or three bedrooms, a bathroom, small yard and no basement. This was true for most of Palo Alto. To be sure, few Palo Alto kids experienced anything like the hardships of McFarland kids, and Palo Alto has the added advantage of being home to Stanford University. But overall it was basically a predominantly white middle class town in the San Francisco Bay Area. I asked members of a Facebook page titled Memories of Old Palo Alto if they felt the characterization of Palo Alto high school kids was fair, and the overwhelming response was that it was unfair. One of those who responded actually ran on the Palo Alto cross country team during the period set in the film and he noted that Palo Alto would not have competed against McFarland since they were in different sections: We did race the same course on the same days but never against each other and we certainly never spoke to any other runners how they portrayed, and we never tried to hire anyone's coach. Our coach brought us to top 3 state finishes. We never talked senseless crap, weren't bigots, never ran dirty throwing elbows or any of that. It was one of the most amazing times of our life actually. Leave it to Hollywood to taint it...
As a former high school runner myself, I have never witnessed or heard of these kind of taunts made between runners. That is not the nature of the competition. It is more common for runners to shake hands before the race and show some mutual respect, even chat after the race. Frankly, cross country runners have a mutual bond, in that many of them are there in the first place because they were not so good in the more popular sports, such as football, baseball and basketball. That was true for me.
But apparently the filmmakers wanted to make Palo Alto symbolic of everything wrong, so they distorted the school and runners in the appropriate manner.
There were some other details about the real life story that might have enhanced the film. For example, to accommodate the Diaz family, who did not want their sons' workouts to interfere with their schoolwork and farm labor, Coach White sometimes coached them at a later hour than his other runners. This showed dedication both by him and by the Diaz brothers, that he would take the extra time in coaching, and that they would squeeze their workouts within a busy schedule.
As the film shows, the first state cross country championship for California was held in 1987, McFarland won the small school division for boys (one of three divisions that year) and became dominant in that division for several years afterwards. In reading about this program and watching the film, what is most impressive to me is not how fast they ran or how many championships they won, but how the sport served to build character for those who participated and enhanced civic pride for the entire community of McFarland. And the dedication of the coach, which I was also fortunate to experience at Mills High School, running cross country 1964-67 for Coach Joe Dees and track for Coach Ed Parker, both of whom sadly passed away in recent years. - Stephen Denney",1445817600,,9662,4.730723606168446

7042452,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"McFarland, USA has all the hallmarks of a cliched sports movie: a troubled coach discovers talent in a group of rag-tag youngsters and through hard work and perseverance they find themselves with a chance to win a championship. But McFarland, USA is so much more than that distillation, and is a great example of how sports movies can be fantastic, when done well. Sports, after all, is merely the canvas on which to address a variety of other intriguing issues. In this case the true story of Coach Jim White (Kevin Costner) and his Hispanic high school students from a California border town in the heart of produce-growing country - families whose income revolves around how many hours of back-breaking picking work they can endure in the scorching sun - offers a lot for viewers. Costner shows once again that he is the king of sports movies, with his earnest likability and ability to conjure a real 'everyman' feel that has depth. The rest of the cast is also excellent, including a number of young first time actors playing the cross country athletes and teenagers of the town. We get a sense of what their hardscrabble life is like in this tale that combines 'fish out of water' (the Coach and his family) and inspirational biopic.",1445299200,,1239,4.7407407407407405

I hate that buying their dvd/bluray does not give you access to the digital stream, the way EVERY OTHER MOVIE does.  Any movie you buy now comes with access to the movie digitally through ultraviolet or some type of site.  Disney tells you to download their app, and then you have to pay to rent the movie you already own.  This is particularly frustrating when you are trying to show the movie to students and are limited to how you can show the movie.

The movie itself is one of my favorites.  I definitely recommend it.  I just hate how it has been released by Disney.  Don't you have enough money already?",1443484800,,711,4.325757575757576

7042529,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"This movie is about Jim White who is a teacher and also coaches the football team.  He ends up getting fired from his job for throwing a shoe at his player which results in the White family moving to McFarland, California which is a Latino neighborhood.  He then gets a job at the school as a P.E teacher.  As he is watching some of the students run around the track he sees how fast they can run and decides to ask the principal if he can get a track team together.  White trains the boys to become really good and they make it to state for track.  White plans a perfect quinceanera for his daughter, but then something tragic happens.  As White was training these boys he was also getting to know them.  For example, when the Diaz boys didn't show up for practice, White went to their house and after that he had a good relationship with the boys and their family.  When you are a teacher I think you should be involved in your students lives like he was in the movie.  At first I didn't think that I was going to like this movie, but now I would really recommend it for others to watch.",1442793600,,1089,4.197115384615385

I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who likes sports or who just enjoys heartwarming stories about real life heroes in our midst.

The true gems are the young Latino boys that play the 7 man cross country team.  Thomas Valez is particularly charismatic and charming.

There's the classism and discrimination against that the young ""pickers"" face as they compete in a private school sport.  The coaches and largely white cross country kids  are particularly obnoxious, it gave me particular pleasure to see the MacFarland team prove successful.",1442275200,,566,5.0978260869565215

Ok, this movie is a cut above some of the heartwarming come-from-the-behind sport movies we all love. it's not the sport that gets us, it's the come-from-behind. If you will, these kids have received an advanced placement in a sport and from there, a desire to better themselves.
So what if, you and I, have a better belief in the people we see/meet/interact with and expect their best instead of what we may have been brought up expecting. After all, we have seen, in many movies, the rise.
It took reading that article for me to realize that this movie and that girl had the same commonality: someone believed.

The story also deals with immigration issues without being skewed to one side or the other.  I believe it was balanced and showed the tremendous contribution made by all those featured in the movie.  The fact that some of our best friends come from McFarland just makes it even more credible and inspirational.",1440979200,,606,5.090909090909091

And the story was incredibly engaging from start to finish! A lot of these sports based movies are very predictable with ""worst to first"" themes. However, gratefully, this one successfully goes well beyond that type of storytelling. I definitely recommend those one for the young and older.",1440892800,,438,4.776315789473684

7042693,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and loved it even more the second time around.  Of course, I love the showcasing of the running, but I love the story behind it and that it is basically a true story and depiction of actual events.  I guess it is human nature to see runners on a team and  not think of what their individual life stories might be; and, that even though they may have a difficult life, they are happy and come from a supportive family.  I think the way this story is told is so human, so true to its characters.  Not to just the runners, but to Kevin Costner's character, and the principal of McFarland.  I would watch it again, and I recommend it any time I can.  It's not just a testimony to what you can do when you truly believe you can do something more, but also a testimony to second and third chances.  Kudos to Disney and Kevin Costner for making such a beautiful movie.",1440892800,,905,4.160919540229885

7042698,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"Tell me if you've ever heard of a movie that uses a high school sports team of underdogs that through hard work and intestinal fortitude find themselves in competition for a championship.  Oh, and they are led by a problematic coach.  Yeah, me too.  Don't care.  Disney Studios, who make films like this on a regular basis finds a winner based on a real life story of the McFarland, California high school cross-country team who won their first state championship in 1987 and then 9 out of 14 in the years that follow.

Niki Caro (""Whale Rider"") is at the helm and steers the movie around the predictable elements with charm and sincerity.  Kevin Costner, who can do these roles in his sleep, stars as Jim White, a hot-headed high school football coach who has been fired from more than one job, mostly because he can't deal with incompetence.  The only job he can find is in the dirt-poor town of McFarland, located between Bakersfield and Fresno in California's central valley.  The town consists mostly of Hispanic immigrants who farm and pick the produce.  White is hired to be the assistant football coach, physical education and science teacher.  He loses the football job during the first game when he refuses to send in a player who he suspects has a concussion.

During his phys. ed. classes he sees that a handful of the students are very fast runners.  He comes up with the idea of starting a cross-country team.  Reluctantly the principal agrees.  Key to the potential success is Thomas Valles (Carlos Pratts, ""Coyote"").  White clocks him running 5 minute miles as he ""jogs"" home to work in the fields.  White is supported by his wife, Cheryl (Maria Bello, ""Prisoners"") and daughters, teenage Julie (Morgan Saylor, TV's ""Homeland"") and Jamie (Elsie Fisher).  We find the White's going through the usual adjustments as newcomers.  There are uncertainties because of cultural differences, but as you might expect, many accept them as their neighbors and mesh those differences.

The biggest conflict is how the 7-man teams will fit in training and competition with school and working the fields.  I wish that in films like this, the confrontations with other teams is more realistic but I guess that helps the audience exude more support for the ""underdog.""  The closing act is predictable and comfortably warm.  Stick around for the closing credits which shows the real people and their history after 1987.  Recommended.

The Blu ray version of the film comes with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio and 1080p video resolution.  As with most modern HD quality transfers it looks great.  Nice colors if subdued for the dusty landscape.  Detail is excellent, including close-ups.  I could find no visual aberrations in the transfer.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which is also very good.  The film has little to keep the surrounds active, but for scenes of large gatherings such as the Quinceanera for Julie.  Most of the action is with the front speakers.  The dialog is clear and easily discernable.  Subtitles come in English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.  Extras include a short reunion with the real Jim White and team members hosted by Costner, deleted and extended scenes, a music video featuring Juanes and a behind the scenes promo.",1440892800,,3260,4.888686131386861

I am glad my privileged children got to see a depiction of what some people have to do to live, and what they are able, even under stressed conditions, to accomplish. Too bad the writers had to fictionalize a few things, like Coach White's career, and omitting one of the runners. It was also unnecessary to demonize rich kids from Palo Alto.",1440374400,,462,4.447058823529412

What makes this story though are the kids. Yeah it is an underdog story and if you like those you will love this story, but the kids they hired to play the real runners were excellent and making me believe in them that much more. I felt it was a genuine testament to these boys' achievement. I also felt it was an honest reflection of what some teachers go through when they make horrible mistakes.

7043272,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"Good movie, heart-warmer (not tear-jerker).  Well-paced.  Costner's character comes across as depressed, downtrodden and grumpy about his future, contrasted to the very different circumstances the high school boys have as field workers and their even more limited opportunities. The boys character development is superficial, and Costner's character develops only in response to each new ""set-back"".  He is the type of person whose inner reflections are limited, and he is a difficult character to like, which is refreshing and unusual to see in a film of this type.  They capture the type of man a coach would likely be, driven by action and reaction and physical response, feeling trapped by his circumstances.",1437782400,,712,5.387387387387387

7043292,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"I am a Chicano, recently turned 68 yrs. young, 100 percent disabled, Marine, Purple Heart, two tours in Viet Nam. But this is not only about the Chicano, Mexican, Mexican/American, Hispanic.  It is about human beings that are deprived, unfortunate due to their Class and/or physicality, abuses, poverty, Etc., but there are those few that on their own  and/or with assistance of another that they male/ Female somehow rise above it all and truly survive, find their place in our World and help others. Myself, just a bit here.  My Dad (*pop) made $1.50 per Hr. as a farm hand back in the 40/50s and supported a wife and four boys on beans and potatoes and twice a week (payday) with hamburger or hotdogs. All boys eventually made it to College.  Me, the youngest, joined the Marines, fought in the Nam, came home, worked, retired and now play golf.  Why?  Because of the inspiration of two main people MOM and Dad and later older siblings.  Simply, please, watch this movie and should it not touch your heart, memories of times past and  instill a desire to help others then please seek help for yourself.  Thank you and,

It is a true story about overcoming obstacles in life and about the power of love and forgiveness. It's about believing in others so much that it

actually allows them to start believing in themselves...the takeaway from the film is that true riches in life are not the stuff we accumulate but rather

the relationships we build with each other...for in those relationships we find LOVE!!!",1437523200,,568,4.603960396039604

7043616,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"I have watched this show several times with different members of my family.  I found that most of them all had the same reaction.  The beginning of the show sets the scene of not only Kevin Costner's professional history as sort of a hot head coach that can't keep a job and the hard paced back breaking life of the immigrant workers in the fields of southern California.

It shows the obvious reaction of a white family man giving a leery distrusting look at a band of Hispanic men rolling up to small towns fast food caf and the look they share of disbelief, that any band of two or more Mexican people can only mean trouble.
As the story progress it allows the viewer to not only see and realize the hardship that these workers endure on a daily basis, but the hopelessness of never being able to move beyond their destiny of migrant worker.
As the story progress the viewer gets emotionally involved with this team of young men and their struggle to not only win for their team, but for their town and more than anything, for their families with the hope of someday bringing them out of the despair and poverty of multiple generations.
You cant help but get caught up in their race to the finish line, and everyone I have watched this movie with has always had a reaction the same as watching their favorite football or baseball player making the play and scoring the goal.",1436745600,2,1377,4.4563492063492065

7043668,1,B00UI5CU6Y,"Disgusted by the movie supposedly based on a real story.

Real story is that real Mr. White never moved to ""Mexican"" McFarland and changed the town (or at least the runners) from their ""ugly"" Mexican ways as in the movie.

He went there as soon as he graduated, was never fired, and went to a predominantly white town and had been there teaching way back, so pretty much a McFarland native all his life.

So what does this tell me, yes he is probably a good coach, but none of that other stuff ""cultural"" shock ever happened.

By the way very stereotypical way of portraying us Mexicans. If you look at the real Diaz and their parents online, they look nothing like the hot mess they were in the movie. In fact Danny Diaz was not even fat. But yes portray us all Mexicans looking like we never shower, eating like pigs, and just having a nasty culture.

The epitomy of all this was when one of the kid's dad is jealous that the son might go to college. I'm Mexican and never met one single parent that has been jealous of their son maybe to college, they actually want that.

But thanks for depicting us as brainless, gluttons, blood bathed and just like animals.

The non hispanic was the rescuer of the whole town, which as I now have researched is all false. Him being a teacher there all his life since got out of college probably never lived by someone with a rooster, and I'm starting to wonder about that quinceanera bloodbath sequence. Probably false too.

From Mr. White himself: Well, they showed all the Hispanic boys being Catholic, which wasn't true, and I thought was kind of a stereotype. There were several Protestants denominations represented there, but I guess they were trying to simplify things. And my wifes father was a Church of Christ minister, so they didn't need to imply that there was anybody drunk, or smoking, or womanizing, or cussing, or anything like that.",1436572800,13,1890,4.554572271386431

Not all of us are lazy Mexicans, waiting for a lousy government handout to support themselves and their families.  The coach was and is a great person and also shows that not all anglos look down on Hispanics.  The movies shows that when we all work together as people, for a common goal, we can achieve greatness. It's not about the color of our skin, but the content of our character. - Juan J. Hinojosa, Kingwood, TX",1436572800,,558,4.663265306122449

7043677,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"I didn't expect to like this movie much, it just seemed ""formulaic"" in the previews. Boy was I wrong!  Kevin Costner turns in his trademark performance as a flawed man who faces up to his issues and overcomes them, while growing as a mentor and role model for younger people.  It's his stock in trade, but he puts his heart into the role, and it shows.  His co-stars are the Latino youths who make up the ragtag high school cross country team which he coaches.  These are not the typical kids of Hollywood films, not even the typical minority kids.  So ,while engrossed in the unfolding story, the audience gets a real education about the hardships, the sacrifices, the values, and the strength of Latino immigrant families.  By the last 1/3 of the movie, you will find yourself caring about and rooting for this underdog team, and for their families as well.  Costner saves his best surprise for the end, when we find out what became of these big-hearted youths in adulthood.  You want uplifting?  Family-friendly?  Inspiring?

7043683,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"McFarland is an inspirational film based on a true story.  There is much to like about this film, and I do recommend it with genuine enthusiasm.  The movie depicts a ""down-on-his-luck"" public school teacher and coach who takes a teaching job in McFarland, California after washing out of his previous position.  McFarland, a small and relatively impoverished town in California's agricultural heartland, the Central Valley, is depicted as an ""end of the world"" kind of place--populated by Hispanic agricultural workers whose lives at first glance are marked by difficult labor and limited opportunities.  Kevin Costner plays the teacher/coach Jim White, who begins his new teaching job at McFarland High School with uncertainty, worried about the unfamiliar culture and seemingly bleak environment for his wife and two daughters, and clueless about how to relate to the Mexican community.  Observing the running abilities of some of the boys, as well as their endurance and need for a constructive challenge, he lights on the idea of starting a high school cross country team.

What makes the film interesting are some of the ambiguities at its heart.  One the one hand, McFarland and its high school students are presented as discouraged and downtrodden by their lives of hard field work, long hours, little opportunity, an implication of second class status in American society, and even the bleak landscape of California's Central Valley.  But even as Coach White puts together a quality athletic program for his students, and demonstrates his commitment to them in various ways, he and his family are won over, even impressed by the riches of McFarland and its Mexican-American community.  Their hard work ethic, fierce devotion to family, generosity, emotional and mental toughness, as well as their beautiful customs and traditions impress White, his wife, and daughters to a degree that turns their first opinions (and those of the film audience as well) upside down.  While the film does not delve into these matters too deeply, it does at least raise the question of whether a seemingly dull and desolate little Hispanic ag town like McFarland might not outshine wealthier, more exciting and more prestigious communities in some very important qualities.  The film's conclusion provides the viewer with an intriguing answer to this question, without minimizing the real problems that characterize towns like McFarland.

McFarland is well-acted and well-developed in showing how a decent man not only brings good into a troubled community, but also discovers, in humility, that there is much good for him to gain as well from this community that is stronger than he first perceived.  I thought the supporting actors were also convincing and the portrayals of life in a sleepy agricultural town ring true to my own experience (I, too,reside in an agricultural Californian community).

I do have a few criticisms to offer.  I did hear that like most films based on true stories, there may be a lot less truth to the film than the average person might think.  I learned that the real coach White is a Christian man, and that his motivation for working so diligently and passionately on behalf of his McFarland students and community stems from his faith in Jesus Christ.  I've only seen the film once, but I did not catch any mention of the coach's Christian beliefs.  Adapting a story to make it fit the two hour film length or increase its dramatic intensity is understandable, but completely removing the main character's core beliefs changes it to an unsatisfying fiction, squandering an opportunity to show what truly motives people to acts of self-sacrifice.  The film was also unclear in its portrayal of minors working in the fields, again, most likely to ratchet up the drama factor of the story.  In the 1987 time frame portrayed in the film, I question whether these labor laws were being frequently violated (the film never claims that they are).  These high school students would then have been working 3 hours per day, a heavy load of course, but not endless and unregulated hours.

But the positives of McFarland outweigh my criticisms.  McFarland is an engaging film with an inspiring and thought-provoking story.  It is appropriate for all ages as well.",1436486400,5,4275,5.100430416068867

The only thing more awesome than this movie is the authenticity of the real coach White, the Diaz family, and the runners from McFarland.  They were true overcomers, and this movie has you on the edge of your seat, rooting for them the entire time.  From start to finish, it does not disappoint.  Watch it with your family.  You'll be happy you did, and it will give you a great starting point for talks about racism, poverty, hard work, perseverance, and selflessness.",1436227200,,619,4.80188679245283
7043911,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"From only cinematographic perspective, I would have given a  5 star to this movie.  Story line top notched.  Acting engaging.  All characters were believable, alive.  I sat at the the edge of my seat thru out pulling for McFarland, pulling for determination of a few youngsters and their wonderful coach.

My problems is with the solution this movie offers to the underlying social/economic problem.  Yes we have an agricultural town, which seem to have been subjected to generational long labor exploitation.  There is nothing in the horizon for town youngsters but economic servitude, cultural stigmas of having been descended from Mexican immigrants.  I tend to believe higher education is the only thing that could break the chain of economic slavery.  Yes movie shows how that worked in McFarland's case.  Yet I feel the movie feeds in one problem with the university education:  Grants go to those who can excel in sports.  Universities appear to be needing winning teams in the competitive sports arena more than individuals with academic promise?  How about focusing on awarding those youngsters who could excel in science, in research, for a change?  How about offering a solution that works for all youngsters, not only for athletically gifted young men.  How about looking into labor laws so pay is equitable for agricultural labor force, eliminating the need for child labor.

May be another movie is in order this one focusing in on Cesar Chavez.  The deplorable conditions of Mexican agricultural laborers. And how it takes one man to change life for many.  Ah he coined the term ""Yes, we can.""  I bet Kevin Costner could pull that role as well to perfection.",1436227200,,1673,5.014545454545455

These young men and their incredible coach are so heroic, and deserve the attention that I hope this movie brings to them.  I also love the way it deals with the family of the coach and illustrates the sacrifices (at least initially) that families make for successful ""breadwinners"".

And without these places and the people that pour their lifeblood and sweat into trying to make a living there, no one else would be able to feed their families either.  The food would not be in the stores to buy and the prices would be so high you couldn't afford it.

The kids believe that this is what they also will do, that noone in the world outside McFarland gives them a second glance or holds out hope for them.  The way both coach and kids learn about each other is the crux of this inspirational movie.  At the end, you learn what has happened in real life to both kids and coach.",1435968000,,562,4.224299065420561

The movie maybe formulaic and predictable but it nevertheless still a solid sports drama. Credit Kevin Costner for his ability to remain a likable star. Also,it serves more as a sports drama as the movie also provides us a view of the Mexican immigrants' life here in the United States from their culture and customs as well as what they bring into the country with respect to the agriculture industry. Finally,it also provides the viewer positive messages on hope and education especially like the students under Coach Jim White who managed to both survive and surpass the economic challenges of a town like McFarland.",1435708800,,817,4.920289855072464

7044189,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"Read any of my other reviews and you will know that when I say, ""spectacular"" I mean it. It was a subtle, nuanced film portraying a real to life experience, no doubt informed heavily from the real man upon which this film is based, and whom you can see at the end of the film. Every character was fleshed out, except perhaps for something more with the daughters, but I can give it a pass since hey, it wasn't really about that. And to read any of my reviews, also means you'd know how rare it is that I give things like that a pass. The only reason to do so is a heartfelt genuine film, excellent script, phenomenal cast/casting, excellent music and beyond all things, no exploitation of any kinds and no stereotypes. This is how a remarkable true story should actually be told. Well done.",1435363200,,790,4.380952380952381

7044213,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"I am not Spanish. I just like the Language, the Music and the Spanish people. I find them to be accepting and friendly. I may have to give information about the movie in order for me to present a proper perspective of its significance. This movie is important because it demonstrates that Spanish, specifically Mexican people are open to strangers, it is part of their culture, I think. The time period of this movie is before the BIG drug problem We All Suffer From, regardless of our ethnicity. This is not  a movie just about a sport alone. It is about how running and a very positive relationship between the coach, his family and his community transformed these young men's lives. Prejudice is often taught in the home. My parents were very prejudiced people. My maternal grandparents were NOT prejudiced at all. My grandfather's family was from Ireland, grandmother's from Germany. I lived with my grandparents during much of my formative years and that provided me with fertile ground to value people of different ethnic back rounds. There was a different element of prejudice shown in the movie, this was a prejudice against education .Spanish American people are undervalued today. Many people are not aware of their contribution. I worked in a greenhouse years ago, when the tables were very low. I had to quit. For me, this was back breaking work, and it is nothing compared to picking fruit and vegetables in the hot sun. I had an opportunity to speak to a Mexican gentleman who told me, very proudly, he had spent his entire life picking fields in his homeland. Please see this movie. We are movie addicts. It is hard for us to find movies we have not seen.  We rented it, but we will own it. The acting was great. The town very believable and perhaps you will see the Spanish American people in a new ' accepting ' light.",1435363200,,1835,4.660493827160494

The coach makes a discovery that will change his life and the lives of 5 Mexican boys forever.

However, I was disappointed to learn that the storyline is fabricated in part, with the real Coach White having spent his entire teaching career in McFarland.  Kevin Costner is no Ray Kinsella anymore.. his voice has gone gravelly and it took awhile into the movie to get past that fact that he seemed a bit old to be playing the father of a pre-teen and a high school freshman, but it's clear that he was passionate about the project.

Along with emphasizing the values of hard effort, team work, goals and other positive concepts for success it also had a message that said, despite ethnicity or hardship we can rise above circumstances. Coach White (Kevin Costner) took more than a passing interest in the Hispanics he worked and lived with. He came to understand and respect the limitations of the field worker in the Bakersfield/McFarland CA area and mentored the track team he coached to success in life and on the track. Costner did a convincing job as coach and resident in a town and school that were definitely out of his, and his families, comfort zone in the beginning.",1434499200,2,723,4.934426229508197

7044561,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"I live in Texas and can say the atmosphere invoked by ""McFarland, USA"" (while taking place in California) is a perceptively accurate representation of any Latino community.

I once worked in a town very similar, and encountered a moment almost identical to Kevin Costner and his family when they go to the local restaurant and can barely find a recognizable item on the menu. My expectations were low going into this film - a Disney sports movie - and what a wonderful surprise. It's not just good, it is unusually inspirational.

I considered the ""White Messiah"" issue several times, but Costner's character is lost when he arrives in McFarland. The town saves him, rather than the other way around. Only a very alert filmmaker could have pulled that off, and much of the credit must go to director Niki Caro, a New Zealand woman who burst on the scene in 2002 with yet another inspirational classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whale-Rider/dp/B005I0DV4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whale Rider</a>. She's far more interested in the community rather than the sporting events. In fact, the cross country races take up only a small portion of the film's two-plus hour running time.

Having been a sports reporter, I covered a very good cross country team that won a Class 3A state title (and like the runners of this film, they too were Latino). I discovered a sport where the athletes were not only unusually dedicated, but surprisingly mature and excellent students. Success in this most difficult sport requires a sacrificial depth that carries over into daily life, and all of the athletes moved on to collegiate and community success.

Cross country racing is one of the purest sports, requiring a unique combination of isolated mental and physical fortitude. You're either prepared or you're not, and the sport exposes such truths at every competition. ""McFarland, USA"" conveys this in striking ways. The racism from opposing teams and coaches I thought was forced. And there was some lowrider gang warfare which bored me. But those complaints are minor. ""McFarland, USA"" is a shockingly good film that tells an important story.",1434499200,2,2178,5.268011527377522

That said I must add that I have really been disappointed at the recent Kevin Costner film offerings.  While its nice for him to support a film like this (and his performance is heads above the rest of the cast), I miss the old ""hero-centric"" films he use to make. Now in his fifties he has the ability to produce epic tales about people over the age of 50.  Not feeble, lame, ineffectual people - but smart, canny, mature adults who save the world with logic and decisiveness based on their lifelong experience.  A thinking man's hero... like Cary Grant and Gregory Peck.

Trust me Kevin, there is a market for that.  And you would really add to your legacy.",1434412800,,886,4.563291139240507

7044642,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"What can I say?  It's a Disney film, so it isn't terrible.  What it is, is a true-story-feel-good-movie about Hispanic kids in a dead-end community who have no hope and no future, beyond following their parents into a life of picking other people's crops.  Then enter a has-been school teacher who takes a handful of these kids and turns them into a cross-country track phenomenon.  Starting with less than nothing (not even running shoes), they chart a course to self-respect, community pride, hope and possibility.  As I've already said, it's a Disney movie, so you don't need me to tell you how it ends.  What I will tell you, though, is that this is a lot better than you might otherwise expect.  Kevin Costner is remarkably good and convincing as the washed-up athletic coach with no track and field experience, who takes a rag-tag group of nearly-drop-outs and works a major transformation--not just with his team, but with himself and his family, too.  Even as the film pushes your buttons (and you know they're being pushed), you can't help rooting for these underdogs, and as the credits roll, you'll have a few more surprises.  This is formula movie-making, but the formula works, and the end result is more than you might expect.  The film is excellent fare for a family movie night, and it works well as a discussion piece, too.  Watch it with some teenagers, and you'll have plenty to talk about afterwards.",1434412800,3,1420,4.778688524590164

If you put aside some slow parts of the movie and focus on the characters, this is one of the best movies I have seen in a while.  I found myself teary eyed at times, laughing at times, and even did a few fist pumps!!!

7044714,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"Every year or so, there seems to be a new movie about a rag-tag group of unlikely people who are thrown together by circumstances with a mentor who sees potential in them and organizes them into a socko team that beats the smirking, overconfident opponents.

McFarland USA delivers on that clich&eacute;, but this time the mentor is a white bread coach who apparently was fired and sent with his family to his last-chance position in a Latino neighborhood. Apparently much of this was fictionalized but the overall spirit of joining into a community of seemingly disparate friends is true. The real life Jim White, who appears in a bonus feature, is very happy with the film (and how many real life people are pleased with how their lives were fictionalized?)

And therein is the reason for this movie's merit. It's about the young runners, but it's also about their families and friends, sharing cultural traditions with nary an ounce of disdain. If this comes across as too much of a Disney fable, and maybe it is, the up side is that there enough positive messages out there for young people to watch.

Kevin Costner is at his minimalist, Gary Cooper best in the role of father to his family and fish-out-of-water leader to young people with whom he seems, at first, to have little in common.

Though there is no audio commentary, which would have added tremendously, there are a few nice little extras, the best being a reunion between the real students, now grown and largely successful.

These small independent Disney films are a stark (forgive the Marvel pun) contrast to the superspectacular tentpole films of today. Though films are fine, too, but there is room for simple stories about ordinary people.

Walt Disney Records has also released a soundtrack CD of Antonio Pinto's unique score for the film.",1434326400,,1814,4.835483870967742

7044757,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"Brilliant movie with outstanding acting.  I don't like to reveal plots or storylines in reviews because I think that spoils it for the reader of said review.  However, the boys who played the guys on the McFarland High School cross-country team were amazing.  And kudos to the actress who played the mother of the Diaz boys as she was hilarious in a subtle way and was a joy to watch.  The story itself is a true one and is a Disney movie.  You feel like you're right there with them, pulling for them, cheering, laughing, crying, and every emotion you could want in a film.  And settings were perfectly chosen and the direction was spot-on.  There's a scene where one of the runners was sitting on a bridge rail.  I won't say more than my heart was in my throat watching it play out.  And the young man who played that character was deserving of an Oscar.  I rooted for him at every turn in the film.  This movie made me think differently about some topical issues like immigration reform and I agree totally with Hillary Clinton on how to fix it.  I watched this movie 3 nights in a row and I never do that.  It was an inspiration!  Don't miss it!",1434240000,,1149,4.333333333333333

Formula:
White (as he is repeatedly called throughout) guy, out of touch, clearly never has stepped out of his 'White' bubble - gets shamed repeatedly and taught life lessons about hard work (geez, how did he ever get to be 55, through college, two kids and a marriage on his own?). All competing running teams are a lineup of White, prep-school looking 'snobs,' ALL hispanic/latinos are upright, honest, work 24/7 - and know all the value of everything. The White guy can barely get around to find a restaurant to feed his family. Oh my, oh my -- what is he going to do??!

One of the most blatantly bigoted films I've ever seen. Truly sad that Costner was a part of this. This movie is a Hollywood pro- illegal immigration movie and nothing more. On top of that, it's really not very well done.",1433980800,,878,4.48125

It reminded me of my childhood so I guess I am a little partial to small town living.  The story was very inspirational and gave us a glimpse of both sides of the coin, so to speak.  The impact on the kids growing up as field workers and then the coaches relationship with the kids he is coaching and the relationship with his own children and learning to fit in with the town.  The acting was exceptional from everyone involved. It's the kind of movie that stays with you for a while.",1433721600,,604,4.128205128205129

7045035,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"This is an uplifting film that's well worth the rental cost. I will be buying it now that I have seen it. Kevin Costner turns in another strong performance. But, the entire cast is great. It follows the coach, Costner, and his family as they move to McFarland, California. McFarland is a poor community predominantly made of migrant crop pickers. For reasons that you will find out when you watch the film, this is Costner's last chance to coach at a high school. He starts a cross country team, and the rest is history. The coach and team are given the opportunity to save each other. It's a great film.

7045133,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"In Mcfarland USA, a troubled coach (Costner) moves to a small dusty agricultural California town and finds himself out of his element until he attempts transforms the schools migrant students into a team of championship contenders.

Disney must have not advertised this movie much as I don't ever recall seeing anything about this, trailer or otherwise but since this had Costner in it, I decided to rent and watch.  Having recently watched the movie Spare Parts which has a similar type of storyline, this movie follows a familiar underdog type of story.  By no means does this make this movie boring or bad as the best part of this movie, like Spare Parts, is that this is based on a true story of the real coach and his students.  Having spent some time in the Imperial Valley of California when I was only a couple years out of college, I experienced a bit of the same culture shock that Costner portrayed in the movie, but the one thing that I found being there and the story tells very well is the unique, family oriented and welcoming culture that the Mexican-American migrant community has.  I was an outsider from a small Kentucky town but felt more welcome than anyplace I have lived before or since.  It was something that definitely made an impression on me and this movie displayed those things very well, that you cant always judge a book by its cover.  So for me, I understood the story and the reasons why Coach decided the things he did as home can be anyplace as long as you are willing to give the unlikeliest of places a chance.  I like when these true stories show the real people at the end and how their real lives turned out, both the good and the bad.

This movie is an inspirational tale and worth watching.

7045150,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"I've always liked sports movies, especially the true stories! There's just something so inspirational and moving about them.

Costner's character Jim White is a coach of football but has had a string of bad luck with his teams and jobs. He winds up in the only place that will take him: McFarland High School. He has to relocate his family who isn't exactly thrilled at their new environment. Not only do they have to adapt to a new home, school and town but a new culture as well.

He has drama with the coach there as well so his football coaching career doesn't last long. Inspiration strikes when he sees a couple boys running and by running I mean running FAST!

He decides to start a Cross Country team and the results are magical. These boys who pick in the fields every morning before school and every afternoon after school to help their parents make a living have the endurance that it takes to run! Now all they need is the training from a coach who believes in them and cares about them.

It was so inspirational to watch these boys blossom before my eyes and see them develop into these young men who suddenly had more to look forward to than a life of just work. Because of this coach's belief in them and pushing them, they all had futures they never knew were possible. They went to college and ran and almost all ended up in jobs helping others, even teaching and coaching back in their home town.

My favorite scene of the movie was the last where the real men were all running together along with McFarland's new cross country team whom they regularly train with. McFarland USA an amazing story of courage, hope and showing the difference one person can make in the lives of others.",1433289600,,1701,4.474193548387097

Every American should see this so we are reminded that the produce we consume is picked by people we try to treat as sub-human and nothing could be less American than that, the land of the free. These migrant workers work very hard and yet they treat their daughters likes princesses at key moments in their lives how outstanding is that. I learned alot from this movie. Bravo Coach White for remaining in McFarland and helping these people to better lives.

7045157,3,B00UI5CU6Y,"McFarland, USA is a small film, comparatively speaking, even though it features a star. With a small budget and a cast of young actors new to the screen, it follows the well traveled formula of sports movie with heart.

 Jim White (Kevin Costner) has jumped to one high school coaching job after another. Now, after a particularly bad episode of unchecked temper, his options are limited. The only job he can find is at McFarland High, a public school in one of the poorest areas of central California. He and his wife and daughters find their new neighborhood of Mexican immigrants unfamiliar and threatening.

 Seeing that several students in his phys ed class are fast runners, White encourages the principal to create a cross country team. But he is unaware of the demands placed on his team by their parents, who are pickers in the fields and need their sons help before and after school. His practice schedule conflicts with his teams family priorities.

 In the mold of such feel-good sports dramas as Cool Runnings, Glory Road, Miracle, and Remember the Titans, McFarland, USA shows White learning about the boys he is coaching and their tough day-to-day existence.

 Costner has the ability to convey decency even though his characters actions may suggest otherwise. We see White transforming from a guy desperate to hold onto a job to support his family to a thoughtful man who learns from others the importance of placing family first.
 Maria Bello plays Cheryl, the dutiful wife who encourages, advises, and offers support. Cheryl proves to be the bridge between feeling like an outsider and being accepted by the community, a lesson that takes longer for her husband to grasp.

 Carlos Pratts portrays the teams fastest runner, Thomas Valles. Initially suspicious of White and hesitant to join the team, Thomas proves to be the teams anchor as the standings of the team gradually improve through various track meets. Other team members are played by Ramiro Rodriguez (Danny Diaz), Johnny Ortiz (Jose Cardenas), Sergio Avelar (Victor Puentes), Rafael Martinez (David Diaz), Hector Duran (Johnny Sameniego), and Michael Aguero (Damacio Diaz).

 Rated PG, McFarland, USA has its share of cliches, particularly its messages of racial harmony and not underestimating the potential of the individual. What makes the movie stand out is that the boys are treated as real individuals with a strong work ethic derived from back-breaking toil picking produce under the hot sun. They are responsible for keeping up their grades and helping their families well before Jim White enters their lives.

 The boys aren't low-lifes or thugs and White isn't the Great White Savior out to rescue them from lives of crime and drugs and bring them a new set of values. White and the boys are portrayed on equal footing. While he channels their previously untapped talent, he learns as much from his team as they learn from him.

 Bonus extras on the Blu-ray edition include reflections by Kevin Costner, Coach Jim White, and members of the 1987 cross-country team as they look back on the opportunities they were given; Juntos music video; deleted and extended scenes; and the features Inspiring McFarland.",1432771200,18,3196,5.03415559772296

7045166,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"Review of Bluray including Bonus Features
As I post this review of the BD version of this early 2015 Disney feature film, there are already 16 reviews posted here on Amazon. This is because Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of all formats of a film (theatrical release, streaming, DVD and BD) together and putting them under each format. I always recommend that potential customers sort the reviews by newest first  there is an option  and then to note which format the reviewer is discussing.) This is a review of the Bluray which will be released on June 2, 2015. (I was provided an advance screener in exchange for an objective review.)

First a brief subjective review of the film itself. Lets face it. When a film is heralded as Based on a true story (BOATS) and it concerns a sports team, you pretty much know how it will end. The enjoyment comes from how the story is laid out and how good the acting is. This is the story of seven Chicano  high-school boys growing up in the Central Valley area of California who are encouraged by the new assistant football coach to form a cross country track team and win the State championship. The coach  Jim White  is played by Kevin Costner (who has made more than a handful of sports films in his career. No, he didn't write, produce or direct this film. The Director is Niki Caro, who Directed Whale Rider.

I went into this film hoping it was different than all the other inspirational underdog films. No, it wasn't much different  though, at 128 minutes, it probably could have used some editing  but the seven young Hispanic actors (most probably in their first feature role) gave the film heart  and, yes, there were times a lump of emotion filled my throat. So, yes I liked it.

The BD comes with four sets of bonus features. First is McFarland Reflections, an 8 minute featurette with Costner and the real-life Jim White meeting with six of the actual seven members of the team. That was fairly interesting. Next comes a three-minute music video comprised of scenes from the film to one of the neat Chicano songs on the soundtrack. The third bonus  Inspiring McFarland is a very brief, two-minute, featurette with a sentence or two from Costner, White, Director Caro and a few of the team members.  And actors. The last bonus is a compilation of six deleted or extended scenes and runs eight minutes. I found that they did not add anything to the story.

What might have raised my rating of the BD another star would have been a making of featurette showing how the race scenes were filmed.  Watching the film I wanted to know two things: How did the actor do so much running? And how did the low income town of McFarland react to the film crew (which I hope brought money to this still-low income community made up mostly of farm workers. But, also, none of this is revealed.

So, yes, I can recommend the film if you like inspirational sports films and  though it is rated PG  (for a scene of attempted violence - which really never gets resolved)  something to share with a family. But this is also like many BOATS films.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I have always liked Kevin Costner anyway, so when this movie came out and was centered on Hispanics, I just knew I had to see it. The movie is very true to life. The Latino community is very family oriented and very religious and hard-working. The people stick together and are very supportive of one another. I am fortunate in that I got to meet and know many Hispanic families through my volunteer work and also  met a wonderful, loving and caring man.  The movie has a few very touching moments, and you will shed a few tears, but you will also get quite a few laughs, too. We can't wait to get our copy of the DVD.",1431907200,,724,4.164285714285715

7045174,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"As a current high school Cross Country and Track coach I was impressed with the quality and depth of this movie. It is about so much more than running XC. What a life lesson it was for these young men, their families and the community of MacFarland.! The struggles of the coach and his effort to create a team were well done. The workouts depicted pretty much give people an idea what the typical teen XC athlete is required to do. Running long miles, running fast workouts and running hills is what it takes. Tremendous amount of discipline is required of the student-athlete with good coaches focusing on the ""student"" first. I took 26 of my XC athletes to see it one afternoon this track season. All were also all runners on the XC team I coach. They really enjoyed the movie as well. Overall very good and true to life. A few Hollywood adjustments for the movie. The California XC Championships are held annually in Woodward Park in Fresno. The film was not shoot there and their are no massive hills as in movie. While MacFarland won the ""CA State Championship"" at the time their were 3 divisions. The won the small school division which was one of the 3 and would not have won either of the other 2 divisions. Palo Alto school would have run in larger school section. No biggie just a fact. Now there are 5 divisions. Finally there are no stands at finish line. People do line the side areas where the runners finish.
In no way do Hollywood's embellishment of the facts take away from movie or the accomplishment of the caring coach and his outstanding team. By all means see it or get the dvd when it comes out. The movie is a good watch several times!",1430092800,,1659,4.442622950819672

7045176,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"These are good kids, smart kids. They just need a chance at a better future. Jim White (Costner) is a football coach at a prestigious high school. After a halftime outburst he is fired and takes a job in McFarland high as an assistant football coach. When a disagreement strips him of that position as well he isn't sure what to do next. When he sees one of the students running he decides its time for the school to have a cross country team. Fighting with the runners, parents and school he does his best to transform the students, the school and the community. In terms of movies there is really one sure bet. If you put Kevin Costner in a sports movie its gonna be good. Even with those high expectations this did not disappoint. The movie is tremendously inspiring. While watching there is a way you want it to end, and you are right there training and running with them hoping for the outcome you desire. The only bad I can say about it is that I liked his other ones better, but only because I like football and baseball more than running. That in no way diminishes the greatness of this movie though. Overall, Costner proves again why he is THE choice for sports movie actors. I give this an A.",1429574400,,1202,4.370535714285714

7045178,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"We all love David vs Goliath stories, particularly in sports. Director Niki Caro (""North Country""), working from a heartwarming story by Christopher Cleveland (""Glory Road""), brings us a terrific PG-rated tale based on true events. In fact, during the final credits, we meet many of the actual people and are pleased to read what happened with them after the ""happily ever after.""

A tiny little poverty-stricken California town combines two unlikely things, a beleaguered coach and an award-winning cross-country track team. He happens to spot some of his students ""commuting"" (on foot!) between their work as pickers in the fields and their school classes. It takes only one day in the field for him to understand how tough these kids are and how much stamina they must have, just to survive. Both toughness and stamina are essential for cross-country track!

We watch:
  * Kevin Costner (""Black or White"") Coach White steps into his new job with low expectations and a hot temper. He makes ""gringo"" mistakes about Low Riders and the importance of his daughter's fifteenth birthday (quinceaera), but after a humbling day in the field as a picker, he is willing to learn! Costner has rarely been better.
  * Maria Bello (""Prisoners"") is his wife Cheryl, who sticks with him as he loses job after job. She is befriended by a local beautician and starts to feel at home.
  * Morgan Saylor (""Homeland"") Julie turns fifteen in this strange little town, but her dad is busy and forgets.
  * Valente Rodriguez (Lots of TV) Principal Camillo shows us what a high-school principal SHOULD be! He spots phonies and finds opportunities where others might not look.
  * Carlos Pratts (""Coyote"") Thomas is tough and fast. His schedule doesn't allow him the luxury to loaf. Seor Blanco will have to accept him as is, or not at all!
  * Ramiro Rodriguez (First role) Burly Danny Diaz is the anchor of the McFarland team, and NOT because he is muchacho gordo. His gutsy determination inspires them all.

Yes, this is predictable, but you will enjoy every step of your way to a happy ending. As you might hope, the only bad guys are the opposing teams (they play golf!) and the only gunshots are the starter guns at the track meets. You will see no sexual heat, vehicular mayhem or blowie uppie stuff, but you WILL enjoy McFarland's version of a ticker-tape parade, the town's many kindnesses for the new family, and the excite- ment of boys who finally see the ocean!

After I made a mental list of scenes I particularly liked (there is a LOT of humor, and I like humor), I quickly realized there wouldn't be enough space. Go see for yourself, and you might want to take along a tissue or two.",1427587200,,2678,4.739224137931035

His cross country team, made up of poor boys who work in the fields before and after school, gradually starts winning and changing lives.

The basic plot of teacher-brings-hope-to hopeless-kids has been done many times, and yet this movie is not corny or overly-sentimental.  The performances are honest and touching; several parts are played by local first-time actors.  Kevin Costner is excellent as the coach and the epilogue over the final credits brought (happy) tears to my eyes.

There is no profanity, violence, or sex in the story.  It is inspiring and often surprising.  Highly recommended.",1427500800,,742,5.082644628099174
7045180,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"McFarland, California:  whos heard of it?  Probably very few until they saw this movie; I certainly hadnt.  Located in central California, it is as dry and brown as can be, and a miserable place for poor Hispanic teenagers working long hours picking fruit and lacking the wherewithal for college.  Kevin Costners character comes into their lives because he couldn't find a replacement job as a coach and P.E. teacher anywhere else.  He comes to understand them and realizes they have excellent endurance as runners.  He makes a 7-man cross country team out of them.  His family comes to love the people of McFarland in spite of the cultural differences.  Theres nothing different thematically about this from other movies that show minorities accomplishing things and white people getting past cultural differences, but I think the casting and realism of the experiences, i.e., the refusal to overdramatize, make this movie a rewarding experience.  I don't consider it better or worse than other movies of its ilk, but I consider it unique and appealing.  This takes place in 1987, and the man Costner portrays, Jim White, would help McFarland cross country teams win the state championship 9 times in 14 years as the coach.  (The end credits give more information.)  The original players all went on to college, breaking their families pattern of dropping out of school and staying in manual labor poverty.  They still assemble in McFarland with each other and help out teenage runners there, with former coach White!  That postscript at the end credits was as neat as the movie!

Glenn Kenny on RogerEbert.com characterized the casting this way:  Costners uncanny evocation of Gary Cooper masculinity and Gregory Peck compassion in the role of coach Jim White is the glue that holds it together, but the rest of the cast is equally inspired.  The comedy arises from natural human experiences, like someone asking Costner a question about his yard and him saying I don't have a yard as a wry criticism of the dry climate.  There is a scene which is powerfully reminiscent of the car Herbies suicide attempt on The Love Bug, too, an interesting reverberation of a nearly 50-year-old Disney movie.  The triumphant underdog theme is very well-worn, and it takes a lot of creativity to make it a special experience, and this movie uses the right combination of a lot of things to do so.  While slow-paced, it is very engaging; while drab due to the brownish quality of central California, its got enough human interest to keep the attention.  Its a good movie.",1426809600,110,2557,4.941451990632318
7045181,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"i love recommending a movie to all ages that has no foul language, nudity, sex, or violence, and is dramatic and exciting anyway. Very well put together, well acted, and lots of hold-your-breath moments and then tears. I liked when Coach White tries to do the work his Mexican American students do before and after school, when it shows what backbreaking labor it is to pick vegetables in the fields under the hot sun. It's a good inspiration for all when the coach tells the team what they don't know about themselves: you are super heroes. You have heart. You don't stop. You can do anything.",1426464000,4,594,4.613207547169812
7045182,4,B00UI5CU6Y,"Wonderful movie!  It's nice to see what can be achieved with hard work and perseverance and these
young men certainly proved that along with their coach who believed in them.",1426377600,,174,4.8
7045183,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"Wow! Mexicans are shown as loving, friendly, hard working, (which is putting it mildly) heroic and strong. Some come from families that work closely together as a team. Cooperation is their middle name! They are a spiritual people who are healthy and good looking. They want to better themselves and they know how to survive incredible adversity.

McFarland, USA is about relationships. If you like character development you will love this true story! But it's also about challenging the prejudices many - if not most - Caucasian Americans have about Mexicans. I was lucky enough to fall in love with a Mexican. I could not believe all the different kinds of prejudices I was harboring! While most of us White people will never fall in love with a Mexican or even have a Mexican friend or acquaintance, McFarland, USA will help you to wake-up and realize that most Mexicans are not job stealing thieves or scary criminals. But instead they are more like you - and me - than we would like to admit!",1426377600,58,997,4.7298850574712645
7045184,5,B00UI5CU6Y,"This movie brought me to tears, and I know I was close to standing up and just plain cheering at part of it.  I thought part of my
love of this was because I had retired in Mexico for about 16 years of my life, but my friends that were with me, also said they
wanted to see it again.  It brought back wonderful memories to me, but  the movie itself was well done and based on a true story.
It's nice to see movies that make you feel and have some  depth to them.  I highly recommend seeing this to anyone.",1426377600,7,505,3.911764705882353

It is also a story about how those things change the lives of the coach and his family in powerful ways, just as his coaching his team to greatness changes the boys lives.
