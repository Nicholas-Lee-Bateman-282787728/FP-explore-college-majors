7903759,4,B0000066S1,"This is a must buy for those who enjoyed volumes 1 and 2.
The story is very cute. Noo need for sharing details that will spoil the pleasant surprises in store for you. All I can say is that Pretty Sammy's love interest is revealed; and that's reason enough alone to see this.  ^_^
The only way this tape is lacking in that no real ending to the 3-volume OVA Series is presented.  If you want a complete Pretty Sammy story with a well-defined beginning, middle and ending, you might want to get the 8-volume Magical Project S series.
Pretty Sammy fanatics know that 4 different instances of this series exist. Pretty Sammy originated in a follow-up to the Tenchi Muyo OVA called the ""Mihoshi Special"" and later re appeared in one of the fantasy within a fantasy episodes of the Tenchi Universe Series. Next came the OVA, which is what this tape is from. Later the Magical Project S TV series followed.
Pretty Sammy is so cute, you might just eventually want to see all of these.  ^_^",1000080000,,982,4.4748603351955305
7903760,5,B0000066S1,"The last of the Pretty Sammy OAV.The ending is not the best because it doesn't really end the series,but since it's part of Sasami's world(from Time and Space Adventures)is probably the reason. Anywaz this volume almost left me in tears! Poor Ry-Ohki loosing Sasami to an alien!,and he doesn't even know that he'sn the one Sasami loves the most!  This climax of Pretty Sammy is great! The animation and the plot! My favorite scene was when Tenchi and Ryoko were aboutn to kiss,but the stupid Aeka had to ruin it! Antwaz Pretty Sammy Super Kiss is a wonderful OAV.I also love the ending song.",989712000,3,591,4.6826923076923075
7903761,5,B0000066S1,"Sasami and Misao go to the beach on a company vacation. There she meets Mokoto, a boy she starts to like. Somehow other lifeforms from space have landed on earth to simulate with living beings in order to gather  information. Ramia now has amnesia! (temporary of course!) She lost her  memory after she got hit with a comet from space and she landed on earth.  The lifeform that simulated with Ramia, transfered her memory to some guy  on earth.  Now that guy has magical powers and he is to carry out Ramia's  will,  destroy Pretty Sammy! Pixy Misa joins forces with Pretty Sammy again  and RyoOhki turns into a human, (sort of) If you have volumes 1 and 2 of  this series, I suggest you buy this third tape to complete this OVA. It has  the most interesting story by far. One thing to look for: Check out the bus  jammin' down the street before they get to the beach, I almost died  laughing!",948931200,5,894,4.384146341463414
