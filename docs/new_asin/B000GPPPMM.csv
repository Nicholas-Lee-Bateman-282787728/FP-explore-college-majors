8133771,3,B000GPPPMM,"This collection of ""favorites"" includes many obscure early silent flicks.  One can see where he started.  Uneven roster of material.  Some tedious and some, like JAMACA INN, quite a delight to watch again, altho JAMACIA INN is far from a masterpiece.",1388534400,,250,5.048780487804878
8133772,3,B000GPPPMM,"This set does give you many Hitchcock early movies which are not available elsewhere, but the transfers are very crude.  Despite what it says at the start of each disc, these are not restored in any way.  There is a lot of evidence that the transfer was done from TV video tape sources.  Juno and The Paycock for instance (a truly boring film if there ever was one!) has a tracking error at the top of the screen throughout that is very annoying if one can sit through the film.  At one point, the action stops for a second, and repeats what went on for the last minute.  I am watching ""Champagne"" at this moment, and find that there is a tracking mistake, or ""dirty head"" problem thoughout at least the first half of the movie, right across the middle.  They also have used music much more appropriate for say Faust or some very serious Garbo silent, rather than a light comedy.  I finally shut it off.
  On the plus side, this is ""the only game in town"", and the DVD set was very inexpensive.  If there ever is a proper set with the movies cleaned up, these DVDs will be used for mini fizbies by me.",1198195200,15,1101,4.27536231884058
8133773,4,B000GPPPMM,"HITCHCOCK FAVORITES, from ST. CLAIR, is comprised of nine films Hitch made in Britain (four are silent), plus two episodes of his renowned 1950's TV anthology series ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents."" All of these are in wide circulation among companies that specialize in public domain material. A distinguishing feature of this particular multi-pack are the extras provided: movie posters, A radio show episode and several Hitchcock film trailers.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-HITCHCOCK-COLLECTION/dp/B0006Z2NSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The HITCHCOCK COLLECTION</a>, also from ST.CLAIR, is the ideal companion to this DVD box. The two packs in combination will give the Hitch fan a majority of the films made prior to Hitchcock's  leaving England for America in 1940.

ST. CLAIR DVD multi-packs are reasonably priced, and offer fine quality video/audio transfers of unrestored public domain material. Discs are single-side recorded, plastic storage cases fairly sturdy, liner notes appear on box's back cover.
