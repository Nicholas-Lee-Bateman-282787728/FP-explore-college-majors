5680814,5,B00BXPMJL4,"I can't believe it, just one season to go and this show will be complete, never thought i'd see this happen, loved this show as a kid, so nostalgic, these were when tv shows were tv shows and not fake reality crap that we see now, with no name everyday joes and not real actors, hopefully i'll see the day when this all ends and reality shows will be gone, i won't expect it to happen but i can hope anyway, hopefully the final season will have some kind of special feature on it like season one, it would be nice to see a commentary on one of the episodes or an interview with someone involved with the show, a blooper/gag reel or something,this season four has some really good episodes like the return of Ted,i really liked the addition of Jake and Kyle, it added a different mix to the cast, overall a very good season, my favorite season is two, it had the best episodes and i think the chemistry was perfect with the whole cast, can't wait for season five, Heyyy Duuude!!!",1366243200,3,978,4.291891891891892
5680815,5,B00BXPMJL4,"We're almost at the complete series!

Granted this DVD set is not available directly through Amazon, but it was no hassle ordering via this seller. I would definitely recommend it.

I loved this show as a kid.  Watching it now, you see how corny some of the storylines are:
--Mr. Ernst gets to be Sheriff for a day!--
--Danny becomes a cartoonist for the local paper!--
--Mr. Ernst can lower his insurance premium if all the staff pass a lifeguard test by the end of that same day!--
--An archeological site right on the Bar None!--

That said, it still holds up pretty well.  I even found myself laughing out loud a few times.  And now that I'm old I can appreciate some of the wry/irreverent humor.

There's some pretty great moments on these DVDs.
--The Dud Ranch, The Vlecks and their snake eyes stew, Kyle's hat head, Jake's drum solos
--Val Vleck wanting to jump Mr. Ernst's bones
--Mel, Jake, and Danny accusing each other of being POD people
--Mr. Ernst's toupee.
--Mr. Ernst breaking his glasses and not seeing that he's falling in lust with his own (disguised as a woman) nephew Jake! The look on their faces when they dance the tango is worth the price of the DVD alone.
and
One of the best episodes of the entire series: Murder He Wrote - the whole episode is GOLD.  It stars Rock Lovejoy, his no good nephew Biff, the ungrateful son Skippy, lovebirds Ramon and Juliana, Geronimo Big Horn, and Ted and Melody.

So yeah buy this DVD so SHOUT will release Season 5 and we can all watch the capture the flag episode.",1365638400,4,1525,4.4765342960288805
5680816,5,B00BXPMJL4,So glad this is finally out! Only one more season to go to finish the set! Thanks to Shout Factory for releasing solid gold!,1365552000,,124,4.208333333333333
5680817,4,B00BXPMJL4,"Season four of ""Hey Dude"" is finally on DVD! That means 13 more episodes can be added to your collection by purchasing this box set. I actually own a copy, so this review isn't just about the show but about the item for sale. There's not much to say about it, though. The audio and picture quality is the same as the previous sets. We have no more episodes like the atrocious ""Melody's Brother"" from season three, which was a good episode but the picture and sound quality was so bad.

Now I'm going to talk about the cast. David Brisbin (Mr. Ernst), Debrah Kalman (Lucy) and Geoffrey Coy (Kyle) each miss a few episodes here and there (as they have in previous seasons). The character I want to focus on here is Ted McGriff, played by David Lascher. He gets credited for all 13 episodes (as well as being featured on the cover for this box set) but he only appears in 3 and those are all on the second disc. For those who either know the show or at least have finished watching the third season, you know that Ted left in early season three to attend summer school. The following episode is where Jake Decker comes to the Bar None and the last episode of that season, Kyle Chandler arrives. Season four begins with Ted still in summer school. He appears in episode 4-08 for a visit and then returns for the duration of the series in episode 4-12.

Disc 1 -
4-01 (episode 40) - They're Back [24 minutes, 23 seconds]
4-02 (episode 41) - Ride, She Said [24 minutes, 21 seconds]
4-03 (episode 42) - Magnum Ernst [25 minutes, 21 seconds]
4-04 (episode 43) - Dudesbury [25 minutes, 20 seconds]
4-05 (episode 44) - Fear [24 minutes, 21 seconds]
4-06 (episode 45) - Secret Admirer [25 minutes, 21 seconds]
4-07 (episode 46) - Lost in the Desert [25 minutes, 21 seconds]

Disc 2 -
4-08 (episode 47) - Return of Ted [25 minutes, 21 seconds]
4-09 (episode 48) - Do the Right Thing [25 minutes, 21 seconds]
4-10 (episode 49) - Doghouse Blues [25 minutes, 21 seconds]
4-11 (episode 50) - Some Like It Hot [24 minutes, 21 seconds]
4-12 (episode 51) - Mr. Moneybags [25 minutes, 21 seconds]
4-13 (episode 52) - Murder, She Wrote [25 minutes, 21 seconds]

If you have the previous three seasons, there is no reason not to buy this one. If you don't have any of these seasons... get them! Seriously, it's a great show from the early `90s.

Sadly, there are no bonus features but since this show hasn't been seen by many in over a decade, just the episodes is good enough for me!",1365292800,,2462,4.378555798687089
5680818,5,B00BXPMJL4,"Season 4 of Hey Dude on DVD is here. The set up is the same as previous releases. However due to lower sales, Shout is only selling this through their website or from an authorized seller on here (which is where I got mine). I actually had mine about a week and half before the official release date. I suggest buying it here because shipping is cheaper than through Shout's site. Either way pick it up so the message is heard to release the fifth and final season.",1364774400,,465,4.295454545454546

5680820,5,B00BXPMJL4,I like it very much. I like their nickelodeon shows. The Cowboys and Cowgirls they ride horses and they like the riding but they like some but it was from Bubble Guppies and Barney. Some are really good sometimes.  That was from the Cowgirl Parade and from Howdy friends.,1395446400,,271,4.530612244897959
5680821,5,B00BXPMJL4,"Hey Dude is most definitely one of my favorite childhood TV shows of all time!  I am 28 years old now and turning 29 this year and I still love it just like when I was A kid!

5680822,5,B00BXPMJL4,I always watched Hey Dude when it was on Nick channel in the early 1990's and season 4 of Hey Dude was excellent on DVD video as watching it directly from the Nick channel in the early 1990's when the show first aired on TV. Great video and always liked watching Hey Dude. Very pleased with Season 4 of Hey Dude.,1385251200,,312,4.131147540983607

5680825,5,B00BXPMJL4,"can't wait for season 5.... if you have the other seasons you have to complete your collection... This season had a couple episodes I wasn't so familiar with so I definable enjoyed that. At least one episode had poor video quality, presumably for the same reason as previous seasons. Audio was decent though and didn't prevent enjoyment.",1371945600,,337,4.9298245614035086

8575139,5,B00BXPMJL4,"The last season of Nickelodeons comedy Hey Dude! included some cast changes as one of the cast members left and two more were written in to take his place.  While I never quite warm to the new characters the way I do the original, I was surprised to find just how fun season 4 is.

The action takes place on the Bar None, a dude ranch in Arizona.  The ranch is owned by Benjamin Ernst, aka Mr. E. (David Brisbin).  The only other regular adult on the show is Lucy (Debrah Kalman) who is in charge of the stables.  The rest of the cast are the teenagers who are on staff.  Theres Danny the Native American (Joe Torres), Jake who just happens to be Mr. Es nephew (Jonathan Galkin), Kyle (Geoffrey Coy), Brad who is an expert at horses (Kelly Brown), and Melody the lifeguard (Christine Taylor).  Rounding out the cast is Buddy (Josh Tygiel), Mr. Es son who is just a little younger than the rest of the cast but is treated as an equal most of the time.

So what is the cast up to in these thirteen episodes?  Brad finds her heart softening when she visits a neighboring ranch that caters to those with disabilities.  Kyle and Brad lead some young kids into the desert for an over night but wind up lost instead  Danny creates a comic strip based on life at the Bar None, and his friends don't take kindly to their characters.  We meet another neighboring ranch on a couple of different occasions when the Vlecks come to stay with disastrous results.  And Jake and Buddy try to track down the monster in the lake on the ranch.

Then theres Ted (David Lascher).  He was written out in the middle of the last season when the actor got a part on a different show.  But the show was canceled so he winds up back for three of these episodes.  Of these, the best is easily the season finale with finds Ted and Melody returning from the local infirmary to find everyone on the ranch plotting to kill Mr. E.  What they don't realize is it is part of a dinner theater.  The results are hilarious.

And, frankly, fun is the name of the game here.  The multi-camera no laugh track format predates the popular sitcoms of today.  The antics of the characters are always funny, and I cant help but smile if not laugh the entire time Im watching.  There is plenty of slapstick humor as well as witty lines as the characters tease each other.

All of this is served with a healthy dose of cheese.  These episodes premiered in 1990, but the late 80s influence is still strong.  Youve got to be in the right mood to enjoy the episodes, but if you are, youll enjoy them.

That also applies to the acting.  Its a bit over the top and broad, but somehow it fits the show and audience perfectly.  I really cant imagine this show acted in a more serious way and working as well.

Mr. E. has always been a bit of a goofy character.  If it weren't for Lucy (who is only in about half the episodes), there would be no serious adult role models.  And yet, I found myself impressed here with several times where they went out of their way to show us that Mr. E. isn't quite as stupid as he always appears.  Hes still a goof most of the time, but it may be more for show than anything else.

The seasons of this show were super short, so the set consists of thirteen half hour episodes spread out over two discs.  The picture quality and sound are fine.  Yes, it could be sharper and clearer, but it works to give us the show.  Only die hard home theater people will be complaining.  Like the last couple of seasons, there are no extras here.

This show is definitely an acquired taste, but I was just at the age to fall in love with it the few times I watched it with friends as a kid.  So I was very happy to travel back to the Bar None with Hey Dude - Season 4.",1433808000,,3732,4.216101694915254

8575142,5,B00BXPMJL4,"One of my favorite shows ever! I discovered the show when I was looking through the internet looking at different early Nick shows. Hey Dude was one of the only ones who really stood out to me. The show is a comedy, but also teaches life lessons. The setting is on a Dude Ranch where teenagers work and live for the summer. Mr. Earnest owns the ranch and has a son named Buddy. They get in many scrapes and scrabbles, but always manage to get out of them comically. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys comedies. Though I'm sure anyone could enjoy the show!",1420070400,,569,4.327102803738318
8575143,5,B00BXPMJL4,"Another season of a great tv show.  The content is truly that of the early 1990s and some remarks are not always politically or culturally correct, but if you look at it as just a humorous tv show then it is awesome!!",1416441600,,217,4.166666666666667
