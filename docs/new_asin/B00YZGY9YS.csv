8719410,2,B00YZGY9YS,"This performance was done in a life-size (or larger) replica of the original Globe Theater, and is designed to show how it might have been presented in 1600 (with the exception that the womens parts were played by women instead of the usual boys.)  It lasts 2.5 hours.  I found the novelty interesting for the first half hour, but afterwards got bored, and skipped through a lot of the remaining 2 hours.  (The audience on the ground floor was standing for the entire 2.5 hours!  I cant imagine how anyone would want to do that.)  In this day and age there are better ways to present Shakespeare; we don't have to subject ourselves to the limitations suffered by a 1600-year audience.
 If you want authenticity I recommend Laurence Oliviers Henry V, which starts out showing how the play would have been presented in 1600 (and done better, too, than this Julius Caesar version); and then gradually melds into a very enjoyable modern presentation for the remaining performance.  Shakespeares language is preserved, and there is a much more effective delivery of the soliloquies.  You get the best of both worlds.  (I might add that the accompanying optional commentary was very interesting also.)",1500508800,,1195,4.9054726368159205
8719411,4,B00YZGY9YS,It feels very much like you are in the audience watching a play.  Sometimes difficult to hear what the actors are saying.,1499299200,2,121,4.5
8719412,5,B00YZGY9YS,Awesome!  Worked great on our computer and blue ray! Wonderful performance.,1488499200,3,75,5.818181818181818
8719413,5,B00YZGY9YS,I love the Globe on screen! Good for classroom viewing--the scene with Portia's thigh is awkward in any rendition of the play. There's also a 10 second burst of a nude statue in the last act. But it''s nothing a mature class can't handle. Best rendition of JC I've seen yet.,1477353600,6,274,4.392156862745098
8719414,5,B00YZGY9YS,This is a live performance recorded at the rebuilt Globe Theatre in London.  Perfect way to see a live performance of Julius Caesar and how it is blocked for the audience.,1465344000,5,171,4.516129032258065
