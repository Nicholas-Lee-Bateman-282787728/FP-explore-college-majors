3558562,4,B001EZE5DI,"The movie follows Shakespeare's script perfectly.  The only thing is that the scenes aren't listed by acts and scenes; instead, they have quirky titles, which makes it difficult to match up a scene from the play with a scene from the movie.",1402790400,,240,4.714285714285714
3558563,5,B001EZE5DI,I've just completed my Leonardo Decaprio Collection by adding Wolf of Wall Street.  I think I have them all up to date.  My all time fave is Titanic though.,1396656000,,156,4.344827586206897
3558564,5,B001EZE5DI,"Leonardo Di Caprio has always been a good actor, no matter what kind of role he plays. I bought it especially for The man in the iron mask and I watched it many, many times plus always when I see it on the TV. It is very well done film, the actors well chosen. The music is exceptionally beautiful and appropriate for the film. Don't miss it - it is a real pleasure watching it.",1372464000,5,378,4.053333333333334
3558565,5,B001EZE5DI,All three films are excellent; DiCaprio delivers every time. Watch Romeo and Juliet more than once to fully appreciate the film.,1292284800,3,128,5.142857142857143
3558566,2,B001EZE5DI,I got this for The Man In The Iron Mask. I figured I would give The Beach a try. I never did like Romeo and Juliet when it came out. I was actually hoping that my opinion would change. I still HATE Romeo and Juliet. This is a strange movie. I do like Paul Rudd though. The Beach was just boring and really didn't go anywhere. I should have just gotten Man In the Iron Mask by itself. I ended up giving this set to a friend and buying the other movie on Amazon.,1275436800,2,460,3.904255319148936
3558567,3,B001EZE5DI,"If you're new to Leo, and you watched these three movies, you'd most likely be unimpressed. Man in the Iron Mask is actually a pretty good movie. Romeo+Juliet I find good, but it's one of those movies that you either love or hate. The Beach is alright as well, but not the best.

If you want some of Leo's better work, check out:
Titanic, The Aviator, Blood Diamond, Revolutionary Road and The Departed.",1260835200,10,403,4.52054794520548
3558568,1,B001EZE5DI,"If is were your first introduction to Leonardo's work, I think you'd be disappointed. By all means get The Man in the Iron Mask - he's great. The other 2 movies are a sad disappointment - much to do with the movies in general but definitely not his best work.

8299993,5,B001EZE5DI,"I bought this just to prove to my husband that he could understand Shakespeare, under the right circumstances. He was amazed. He couldn't believe how many times he had heard quotes (and seen parodies) from it and never knew where they came from. This movie should be mandatory for all high school kids that are studying Shakespeare. Leo gets the girls attention immediately, and the action and violence will keep the boys tuned in as well. The Man in The Iron Mask has always been a favorite of mine, and I've still never watched The Beach, but I hear good things about it and plan to watch it soon.",1489017600,,599,4.504587155963303
