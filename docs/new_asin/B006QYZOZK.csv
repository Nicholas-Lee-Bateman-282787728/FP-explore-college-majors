8503422,5,B006QYZOZK,One of Vice Ganda's most funniest movies! I didn't like the old movie look and some parts were very cheesy but a lot of the movie was funny and had a great moral!,1407196800,,162,3.9393939393939394
8503423,2,B006QYZOZK,The DVD was sent fast but the quality of the video was poor. There were instances where it froze three times and I had to rewind and play back the scene.,1354406400,,153,3.967741935483871
8503424,4,B006QYZOZK,"It's Vice Ganda. Such a huge fan of her! Now, I've been in states for too long and watching Filipino Movies just gives me the tingles. It is just the feeling of having, kinda like the pride of people saying your own language kinda thing. oh, what the heck? Anyway, it is a good laughable movie. It could be better but I like it. It doesn't fail to bring you to laughter. Acting is good. There are silly things I are included that I have to ask my dad or grandma what it means, but if I knew, I find it funny. LOL.",1335657600,,513,3.9902912621359223
