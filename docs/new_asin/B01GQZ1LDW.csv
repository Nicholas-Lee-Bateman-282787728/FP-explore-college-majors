8763366,2,B01GQZ1LDW,"A couple of guys in Jim Thorpe, Pa. go on a killing and rape rampage and film it. Another film crew gets caught up in the action. Some of it was simply snuff porn. There is better gore out there, this consisted of fake severed male organs and tons of fake blood. Couldn't manage any gut spillage. Hey just go down to the local butcher and get some pig innards. Nice to see Linnea Quigley getting used and degraded again. Her dancing took a serious step downward since ""Auditions"" or ""The Return of the Living Dead,"" but I still love her. Too much of the film is one guy running around filming while showing us his junk. Film tried to be cute with Sphinx type riddles. For low budget cult addicts.

8763367,3,B01GQZ1LDW,Really the only good actor in this whole film was the older brother character. I'm not sure what the am of this film was supposed to be. I guess a mix of Leonard lake and Charles ng meets August underground trilogy. It had tons of potential and I see it there. The horrible acting and the poor writing just kills it. It's in my collection but don't expect awards out of this one.,1479686400,,379,4.205479452054795
8763368,2,B01GQZ1LDW,This film had so much hype and how it was to much for people that they walked out of the film during the screenings. I think they walked out because they thought the movie sucked. The main killer in the film was actually good but the film wasn't. Sure you see some things that could be nasty but overall I'm glad that this film maker has retired. I thought that his other films were better than this. He had lots of potential and I'm not sure what happened to him.,1477699200,,464,4.166666666666667

8763373,4,B01GQZ1LDW,"If you're looking for a grimy, dirty, no holds barred exploitative film with great and graphic kill scenes this one is worth checking out. Don't expect much of a story out of this one however, the movie itself lacks depth as far as story goes but the director does make an attempt at a twist that will keep the viewer attentive. If you have the stomach for it and you are fond of movies such as the August Underground series or other movies of the sort like myself, this one is more than worth checking out. The blu Ray was fantastic having great sound and picture. Worth the money in my opinion!",1469664000,5,596,4.330357142857143
