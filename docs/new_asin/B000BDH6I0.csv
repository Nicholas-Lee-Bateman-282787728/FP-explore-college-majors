2414919,3,B000BDH6I0,"A definitive match by match full length, who's who of the former WWF's crown jewel of sports entertainment.  You get what you want in terms of every full card from the events from 1990-1994, the occasional bleep out of the superstars saying WWF (not WWE) is annoying at times but in now way a HUGE deal. Sounds ok right?

My one bone to pick is with the production itself.  It would have been nice to have some special features, some behind-the-scenes storylines or some insight from the wrestlers and so on. You basically get box, open box, place DVD, watch matches, repeat. There isn't much else to give you any insight or leave a lasting impression or distinctive separations from year to year.

Ithad the best gimics and larger than life wrestlers. Now with my review. The positives are that the entire wrestlemania event are on these dvds. I have them on vhs and I watched both to compare them, and there was a lot of editing on the vhs tapes to fit them in. In fact on wrestlemania 6 and 7 there was about 1 hour of stuff on each taken out of the vhs tapes. Watching these dvds was almost like watching these wrestlemanias for the first time. I am going to get volume 1 soon. Now wwe edited some of the theme songs of some the wrestlers so they don't have to pay royalties, which is strange cause they didn't mess with the theme songs on any of the, royal rumble, summer slam, or survivor series anthologys!? Oh well, thats a small price to pay cause these dvds take me back to childhood and thats awsome!

2414937,4,B000BDH6I0,"This set is one of my favorites from the Wrestlemania anthology collection. This collection holds some of the most memorable and great matches and moments throughout Wrestlemania'a long history.

Wrestlemania VI - Wrestlemania's first international event that for the first time Wrestlemania hosted from Toronto. It held the Ultimate Challenge as the Intercontinental Champion The Ulimate Warrior battled the WWF Champion Hulk Hogan in a rare ""Face vs. Face"" main event match. Where the crowd was seemingly split right down the middle. The event also hosted the last Wrestlemania match for the legendary Andre the Giant where he teamed up with Haku to face Demolition for the Tag Team Titles. Other standout matches include Mr. Perfect vs. Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake, Roddy Piper vs. Bad News Brown, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts vs. Ted Dibiase, & a Mixed Tag Team Match between Randy Savage & Sensational Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire with Miss Elizabeth in their corner.

Wrestlemania VII - This year, Wrestlemania attempted to use the Gulf War in Iraq for their advantage as the WWF put Hulk Hogan(USA) challenging the WWF Champion Sgt. Slaughter(Iraq). But the match of the night that stole the show was the Retirement Match between the ""Macho King"" Randy Savage and the Ultimate Warrior where we saw the reunion of Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth. Undertaker also making his debut at Wrestlemania against Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka where it began the Undertaker's WM Undefeated Streak. Another standout match is The Hart Foundation vs. The Nasty Boys for the Tag Team Titles. Also the last Wrestlemania appearence for the 8th Wonder of the World, Andre the Giant.

Wrestlemania VIII - Wrestlemania's first attempt at a double main event as ""The Real World's Champion"" Ric Flair defends his WWF Championship against Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage. And in the second main event we see the ""Sycho"" Sid Justice battling Hulk Hogan where the Ultimate Warrior made his return. We also see the first one on one match up between Bret Hart and Rowdy Roddy Piper for the Intercontinental Title. Also Shawn Michaels faces Tito Santana where Shawn's singles career & also becoming the ""Heartbreak Kid"" started and evolved.

Wrestlemania IX - Wrestlemania goes back in time to the Roman and Caesar days where for the first and only time Wrestlmania hosted from Las Vegas at Caesar's Palace. We see the debut of Good Ol' Jim Ross (in a toga) and to mention Randy Savage's and Bobby Heenan's outrageous entrances at this Wrestlemania. Hulk Hogan's return and his last WM appearence in almost a decade. Three outstanding matches include Shawn Michaels vs. Tatanka for the Intercontinenatl Title, The Steiner Brothers vs. The Headshrinkers, and Lex Luger vs. Mr. Perfect. I also think the staredown between the Undertaker and the Giant Gonzales is a thing to see.

Wrestlemania X - Wrestlemania returns to Madison Square Garden for it's 10th year anniversary. The Ladder Match makes it's WM debut here as Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon battles for the Undisputed Intercontinental Title. The first one on one meeting between the brothers, Bret and Owen Hart. Randy Savage in his last WM match as he faces Crush in a Falls Count Anywhere Match. And Bret Hart vs. Yokozuna for the WWF Title with ""Hot Rod"" Rowdy Roddy Piper as the special referee.

Overall, this is a good set from the Wresrlemania Anthology. We see many, many memorbale matches here that includes the Ultimate Challenge between Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior, Randy Savage vs. the Ultimate Warrior in a Retirement Match, Bret Hart vs. Roddy Piper for the IC Title, Undertaker's WM debut, and the first ever Ladder Match at a WM.",1237075200,7,3679,5.022950819672131
2414938,5,B000BDH6I0,"I'll talk about how the Undertaker's matches, along with him, made history. In 1991, the Undertaker stepped into the ""squared circle"", and literally, devastatingly mauled, The legendary Jimmy ""superfly"" Snuka! He became 1-0 at Wrestlemania VII (7 in roman numerals), and the ""Superfly"" became his 1st victim, at Wrestlemania. Then, in 1992, he faced another legend: Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts. Roberts, unfortunatley suffered a brutal, devastating, career-threating beating, at the hands of the 7-foot, 328-pound (his weight, back in the 90's), giant. The Phenom received another award: ""2-0"". Then, in 1993, his 3rd Wrestlemania, he faced Giant Gonzales (8-feet, 460 lbs) and was mauled, but won by DQ.",1235952000,,701,5.5
2414939,5,B000BDH6I0,"If Jim Crockett's Starrcade was ""The Granddaddy Of Them All"", then WrestleMania has to be considered ""The Big Daddy Of Them All."" Indeed, it is now the Granddaddy as Starrcade is no longer held.

This volume covers WM's VI-X. I will go do the pain staking task of going through most of the matches. Also, because they were still The World Wrestling Federation at this time, I will refer to all titles with WWF and not WWE. Here we go:

WRESTLEMANIA VI
This was from the Skydome in Toronto, Canada. For those who are recent to pro wrestling, that is the place where in 2002 The Rock met Hulk Hogan for the first time! But that's another review as we are discussing WrestleMania VI where Hogan would defend his WWF Title against I-C Champion The Ultimate Warrior. More on that one later.

Koko B. Ware Vs. ""The Model"" Rick Martel - Good opener. This was pretty much the last bow for Koko as far as WM's go while Martel was pretty much in his prime as a heel. Match ends when Martel finished off Koko with his Boston Crab (known nowadays as The Walls Of Jericho) for the win.

Demolition Vs. The Colossal Connection (Andre The Giant/Haku)(WWF World Tag Team Title Match) - Demolition was coming for their third (and final) WWF Tag Title reign while the aging but still dangerous Andre & Haku were looking to retain here. This match was mostly a 2 on 1 as Haku worked most of it against Ax & Smash. Ends when the odds caught up with Haku and the Demos finished him with their elbowsmash/backbreaker combination for the victory. This one also saw Andre turn on Haku and his manager Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan to a standing ovation! Though The Giant would return for an appearance in WM VII, he would never set foot inside the ring at a WrestleMania again. Sadly, almost 3 years after this, Andre would die in his native France at age 43 I believe.

Hercules Vs. Earthquake w/Jimmy Hart - Pretty much a squash as Herc's power was no match for the awesome size of the ""Natural Disaster!"" Ends when Earthquake squashed The Mighty One with his ""Earthquake"" butt splash for the pin!

Mr. Perfect w/Lanny ""The Genius"" Poffo Vs. Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake - Other than a few house show losses to Hulk Hogan, the late Mr. Perfect lost very little during this period. This would be one of those losses. To his credit, he did make Beefcake look very good without making himself look bad. Ends when Brutus flips Perfect into the ringpost, knocking him out for the pin.

Bad News Brown Vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper - Pretty much a brawl. The most bizzare part was that Piper came to the ring with half of his body painted black! WTF?! Anyway, it wasn't a very good bout but not the worst I've ever seen.

The Hart Foundation Vs. The Bolsheviks - TOTAL SQUASH! Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart and Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart didn't even waste a drop of sweat with the Russian tandem of Nikoli Volkoff and Boris Zukoff! I think this match was over in less than 30 seconds!

The Barbarian w/Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan Vs. Tito Santana - The Barbarian was in the midst of a singles push as he faced former I-C champion and upper mid-card star Tito Santana. Surprisingly, Tito actually had him beat at one point but ""The Brain"" made sure his charge wouldn't be pinned. Ends when Barby nearly decapates Santana with a top rope clothesline!

Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire w/Ms. Elizabeth Vs. ""Macho King"" Randy Savage & ""Sensational"" Sherri (Mixed Tag Team Match) - Not a serious wrestling match but entertaining and a bit of drama with the history between Savage and the late Ms. Liz. ""The Dream"" and Sapphire get the duke here!

Orient Express Vs. The Rockers - In their second attempt for a win at WM, The Rockers take on the newly formed team of Pat Tanaka and Akio Sato with Mr. Fuji. Both teams were pretty impressive here with The O.E.'s dominating most of the match. Ends when Marty Janetty gets counted out after Sato throws some salt into his eyes to where Marty couldn't get back in.

Dino Bravo Vs. ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan - Not a good match at all! Very slow and dull! The only thing good was afterwards when Earthquake showed up and squashed Duggan!

Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts Vs. ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted Dibiase w/Virgil - This match was for Dibiase's ""Million Dollar Belt"" and this is actually my favorite match from WrestleMania 6, more so than Hogan/Warrior! While his WrestleMania III & VIII bouts with The Honky Tonk Man and The Undertaker are more famous, this match was Jake's best WM appearance in my view from a technical standpoint. It was also the best match of Dibiase's appearances at WM. This one I would label as a MUST VIEW if you really want to see the best of both men in their days in the WWF/WWE.

Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka Vs. ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude w/Bobby Heenan - This one was a short match that saw Snuka actually dominate but a mistake cost him the match as Rude hooked in his ""Rude Awakening"" neckbreaker for a surprisingly clean pin!

Hulk Hogan Vs. The Ultimate Warrior (WWF World/WWF Intercontinental Title Match) - As the title implies, both belts were up for grabs here! Other than his matches with Rick Rude and Randy Savage, this is probably The Warrior's most famous match right here! Hogan, for once, actually carried a match as he used moves that he normally didn't use. But make no mistake about it, this match was power Vs. power but it was a mistake at the end that allowed Warrior to get the pinfall and win his first and only World title. The crowd, in my view, also made this match better than it really was! LOL!

Overall, this has to rank as one of the top 10 best of all WrestleMania's to date at least! Maybe even top 5 of all time!

WRESTLEMANIA VII
This one took place during the midst of the Persian Gulf War. Originally, it was set to be in the Los Angeles Coliseum but slow sales plus fears of Sgt. Slaughter, who was WWF Champ at that time AND was playing an Iraqi sympathizer, fueled fears about someone perhaps would take a real shot (literally) at him! So, they moved the event to the Los Angeles Sports Arena where security could be tighter.

Now, let's get to the card, shall we?

The Rockers Vs. Haku & The Barbarian - The future ""Faces Of Fear"" in WCW took on the tag team specialists in The Rockers! Was actually a good bout and their styles meshed really well. Ends when Shawn Michaels hit a very good flying bodypress on Haku for the victory! Incidently, it would not only be the last time that The Rockers ever appeared together at WM, this was their only WIN as a tag team at this event!

Dino Bravo w/Jimmy Hart Vs. ""The Texas Tornado"" Kerry Von Erich - This was a slow, plodding bout that was mercifully kept short. Had this been back in the 1980's, it might've been a classic! As it was, it was two guys that were on their last legs. Still, the crowd was definitely behind Kerry as he used his legendary ""Iron Claw"" along with his discus punch for the win! Sadly, both men would meet their end in 1993 and even scarier, they both died within weeks of each other!

""The British Bulldog"" Davey Boy Smith Vs. The Warlord w/Slick - This was a good power Vs. power match up. Actually, it was more like the brute power of The Warlord Vs. the power, speed and wrestling skills of DBS! Ends with an incredible feat of strength from the Bulldog as he manuveared this near 330lb. Warlord into his powerslam. It must be seen for that alone!

The Hart Foundation Vs. The Nasty Boys w/Jimmy Hart (WWF World Tag Team Title Match) - Fresh (?) from their NWA stint and their short but violent feud with The Steiner Brothers, the Nasties go for WWF Tag Team Gold against the more experienced Hart Foundation. Good power and science Vs. street fighter style matchup! Definitely worth a look!

Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts Vs. ""The Model"" Rick Martel (Blindfold Match) - This one is more for comic relief than anything else! Not a good matchup but then again, how could it be when you can't see your opponent! Daredevil these two weren't! LOL! Sorry, had to make the Marvel Comics reference! Anyway, Jake takes this one.

""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka Vs. The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer - The legendary WrestleMania streak begins here as UT pretty much squashed Snuka! 'Nuff said!

""Macho King"" Randy Savage Vs. The Ultimate Warrior (Career Ending Match) -This was basically an updated version of the old ""Loser Leaves Town"" match from the 80's. This one, in my view, is a MUST SEE on this WM. It is arguably the best match at that event and stoled the show! There is also the emotional ending with Ms. Elizabeth that had everyone in the arena in tears! On that part, all I could say was WOW! Even today as a man in my 30's, I am still struck on how powerful that moment touched nearly everyone in the building that night! Anyway, great match and very good ending.

Demolition Vs. Tenryu & Kitao - In their attempt to copy WCW who had New Japan stars on their shows at that time, WWF decided to bring in stars from All Japan Pro Wrestling. It was a very poor attempt in my view and the match made it even worse. This is not a knock on Kitao and (especially) Tenryu but it was just a bad attempt. Add to the fact that Demolition by this point were the late Crush (Bryan Adams) and Smash and not the originals Ax & Smash and you got just a throw away match here. Ironically, the only one that seemed to be trying really was Tenryu himself! Worth one look just to see how bad it was!

Curt ""Mr. Perfect"" Hennig Vs. The Big Bossman (WWF Intercontinental Title Match) - In one of the few title matches he ever had in WWF/WWE, The Bossman went for the I-C strap held by Hennig! This shows how good Curt was as he carried Bossman to one of his best matches ever! Add in apperances from The Heenan Family and Andre The Giant and you have a pretty good bout. Bossman wins by DQ but Hennig retains the belt!

Earthquake w/Jimmy Hart Vs. Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine - Short but high impact match between these two. Not bad considering their styles. Earthquake takes it with his ""Earthquake Splash.""

The Legion Of Doom Vs. Power & Glory (Hercules/Paul Roma) - This match is one of the best examples of SQUASH! Put it this way, don't go to the bathroom during this one! Oh, LOD took this!

Virgil w/""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper Vs. ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted Dibiase - In a grudge match, Virgil took on his former boss in a surprisingly entertaining match! Ends when Dibiase gets counted out while fighting with an injured Piper outside of the ring.

The Mountie w/Jimmy Hart Vs. Tito Santana - Short bout with The Mountie getting a screwjob win. Watch once, skip afterwards!

Hulk Hogan Vs. Sgt. Slaughter (WWF World Title Match) - As you might expect, the whole building was behind Hogan in this one! Not the best main event but certainly the best way to cap off the evening as it was American themed all night long! Hogan wins after being bloodied by Slaughter.

This one was pretty good.

WRESTLEMANIA VIII
This particular WrestleMania was a mixed bag but it did feature a match that I've been waiting to see for years on DVD! I'll point out which one though anyone that has talked to me on here knows which one I am refering to! Anyway, here is what's on this WM.

""El Matador"" Tito Santana Vs. Shawn Michaels w/Sherri - In this one, it was Shawn Michaels' first solo match at a big PPV as he took on the always capable Santana! It was a good match that saw Shawn get the duke!

Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts Vs. The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer - Another victim to the streak! 'Nuff said!

""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper Vs. Bret ""Hitman"" Hart (WWF Intercontinental Title Match) - This had brawling and wrestling mixed into one here! Not really one of Bret's best matches but certainly one of Piper's best matches! Ends when Bret reverses a sleeperhold into a pin to regain the I-C strap.

The Mountie, Repo Man & The Nasty Boys Vs. ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan, The Big Bossman, Virgil & Sgt. Slaughter - This one was kept pretty short and it wasn't that exciting matchwise. It did have a few funny moments though. Good comic relief.

""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair w/Mr. Perfect Vs. ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage (WWF World Title Match) - This one had great wrestling and drama! This, in my eyes, SHOULD'VE BEEN THE MAIN EVENT! The fact that this match was mid-card was a slap in the face to both Flair and Savage!

I won't get on a rant but I had to get that off my chest. Anyway, the title match couldn't have been any better and it is a ""LOST CLASSIC"" in my view because it is rarely talked about. This one is a MUST SEE!

Tatanka Vs. ""The Model"" Rick Martel - Short bout as it was more to put over Tatanka than anything else.

Money Inc. (Ted Dibiase/I.R.S.) Vs. The Natural Disasters (Earthquake/Typhoon)(WWF World Tag Team Title Match) - This was pretty much a squash as Dibiase and IRS just couldn't get any offense going! In the end, they did a classic heel move and just ran for the hills! LOL! TND wins by countout but Money Inc. keep the belts!

""The Rocket"" Owen Hart Vs. Skinner - Also a short match with Owen getting a quick win over the veteran Skinner!

Hulk Hogan Vs. ""Sycho"" Sid Justice w/Harvey Wippleman - To think you picked this match over Flair/Savage to be your main event?! True, it isn't as bad as say Lawrence Taylor Vs. Bam Bam Bigelow but still!?

As for the match, it wasn't very good at all. The only exciting part was the ending when The Ultimate Warrior made a surprise appearance. By the way, Hogan won by DQ.

View this one for Hart/Piper and Flair/Savage!

WRESTLEMANIA IX
One of the worst WM's of all time and DEFINITELY the worst on this Volume! After a good opener with Shawn Michaels and Tatanka, it pretty much goes downhill from there! The main event was Yokozuna Vs. Bret Hart for the WWF Title which saw Yoko win only to take on Hulk Hogan just minutes later and have Hogan (who had not wrestled in a year) win the title! Ugh! That had to be one of the worst decisions ever by WWF/WWE!

The rest of the card was average. Could've easily have been on RAW or Smackdown today! Look at this one at your own risk!

WRESTLEMANIA X

Definitely a step up from the previous year but not a very strong card once again! Still there are three reasons to look at this WM and all three are MUST VIEWS:

Bret ""Hitman"" Hart Vs. ""The Rocket"" Owen Hart - The best opener in WM history....PERIOD! This one could've been easily upper mid-card or even
the main event! It was that good!

Razor Ramon Vs. Shawn Michaels - The classic I-C title Ladder Match! While Ladder Matches had been done before, this was the first one at a big event like this! Both Shawn and Razor (Scott Hall) put on a great show!

Bret ""Hitman"" Hart Vs. Yokozuna (WWF World Title Match) - This isn't a great bout in all honesty. Still, to see Bret regain the title after losing it one year earlier and the celebration at the end makes this one a MUST VIEW!

The rest of the card was okay to watchable!

On the whole, this volume is worth it for WrestleMania VI and has its share of good moments on it. Definitely worth it with the price that Amazon is selling it at right now.",1235088000,2,15019,4.431941923774954

A couple of notes here in that changes have been made since the original airing of these events in that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since these event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""  It should also be noted that these double sided disc contain the PPV only & no extras.

WrestleMania VI was the first ever international WrestleMania as it was held in the SkyDome from Toronto, Ontario, Canada that include various celebrities such as Steve Allen, Rona Barrett, and Robert Goulet signing ""Oh Canada"" while future WWE superstar & Hall Of Fame member Edge was in attendance.  ""The Ultimate Challenge"" was what defined this WrestleMania as it was a main event under circumstances that we've never seen before & have never seen since as both the WWE & Intercontinental Championships were on the line as the two biggest & most popular superstars in WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior one on one for the first time with the crowd being split in half as what has gone down as one of the greatest matches in both men's careers. Other matches include Andre The Giant's final WWE match defending the Tag Team Championships with Haku vs. Demolition, Dusty Rhodes sole WrestleMania in-ring appearance teaming with Sapphire against Randy Savage & Sherri featuring the surprise appearance of Miss Elizabeth, a rare Million $ Championship title defense by Ted Dibiase vs. Jake Roberts, Bad News Brown vs. Roddy Piper who's physical look was controversial to say the least, Mr. Perfect defending his undefeated record against Brutus Beefcake, Jimmy Snuka vs. Rick Rude, Big Boss Man vs. Akeem, Jim Duggan vs. Dino Bravo, Rockers vs. Orient Express, Tito Santana vs. Barbarian, Hart Foundation vs. Bolsheviks, Earthquake vs. Hercules, and Koko B. Ware vs. Hercules.

WrestleMania VII was ""Superstars & Stripes Forever"" complete with the Mania logo in red & white & blue colors with American flags hung around the arena as celebrities involved in the event include Regis Philbin, Alex Trebek, and Marla Maples while many more were in the crowd as well with Willie Nelson singing ""America The Beautiful."" This event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various superstars like Sgt. Slaughter, Kerry Von Erich, Nasty Boys, japanese superstars Tenryu & Kitao, and one other superstar who I'll get to later.  The WWE Championship was defended by Sgt. Slaughter with General Adnan against Hulk Hogan in the controversial angle where former patriot Slaughter denounced America in favor of being an Iraq sympathizer causing Hogan to take the role of the American hero while Slaughter made it clear that he was playing under a new set of rules where he admitted that he had no problems getting disqualified or counted out because that meant that he still remained champion. The other attraction match on this card was Randy Savage vs. Ultimate Warrior in a Retirement Match that has gone down as one of the greatest matches in their careers but also very memorable for the aftermath that made this not only my favorite WrestleMania moment of all night to this day but was so emotional that you saw audience members in the crowd crying tears of joy. Another match that wasn't memorable at that time but is now looking back in time was not only the WrestleMania debut of The Undertaker vs. Jimmy Snuka but also the beginning of what has gone down in history as ""The Streak"". Other matches include Tag Team Champions Hart Foundation vs. Nasty Boys, Intercontinental Champion Mr. Perfect vs. Big Boss Man, Ted Dibiase vs. his former bodyguard in Virgil who had Roddy Piper in his corner, Jake Roberts vs. Rick Martel in a Blindfold Match, Tito Santana vs. Mountie, Legion Of Doom vs. Power & Glory, Greg Valentine vs. Earthquake, British Bulldog vs. Warlord, Texas Tornado vs. Dino Bravo, Rockers vs. Haku & Barbarian, and Demolition vs. Genichiro Tenryu & Koji Kitao in what was a crossover appearance for an upcoming tour of Japan was being co-promoted with WWE.

WrestleMania VIII made it's way to the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana for this edition of the event which was the first time in history being promoted as having a ""double main event"". The only celebrities involved with the show was Family Feud host Ray Combs & Reba McIntyre singing the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" while this was the WrestleMania debuts for Tatanka, Sid Justice, Lex Luger (via satellite to promote the World Bodybuilding Federation) and Ric Flair.  This Mania was built up as the possible retirement match of Hulk Hogan as he faced off against Sid Justice in a match that's mostly remembered for the confusing ending that to this day was given a clear explanation & the aftermath that lead to one hero's return. The other main event was for the WWE Championship with Ric Flair defending against Randy Savage but was more personal than that with Flair having pictures claiming he was in a past relationship with Savage's wife Elizabeth in what was definitely a classic emotional encounter between the two men that saw people from Mr. Perfect to Elizabeth herself get involved. Another emotional match involved Intercontinental Champion Roddy Piper vs. Bret Hart in a match that got not only bloody but saw a different side of Piper in the ring as he adapted to Bret's technical wrestling style & did more wrestling than he's done in his entire run in the WWE. Other matches include Shawn Michaels vs. Tito Santana, Undertaker vs. Jake Roberts, Tatanka vs. Rick Martel, Tag Team Champions Money Inc. vs. Natural Disasters, Owen Hart vs. Skinner, a entertaining six man tag match with Jim Duggan & Virgil & Sgt. Slaughter & Big Boss Man vs. Nasty Boys & Repo Man & Mountie, and an interview with the returning Legion Of Doom along with their returning long time manager Paul Ellering.

WrestleMania IX went back in time as it was held in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace for what they termed as the ""World's Largest Toga Party"" that featured various animals from exotic birds to elephants, roman soldiers, Caesar & Cleopatra, and with the unforgettable entrance of Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan while it should also be noted that this was the first ever WrestleMania after the debut of ""Monday Night RAW"" as this event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various legends like Jim Ross, Luna Vachon, Steiner Brothers, Scott ""Razor Ramon"" Hall, Bob Backlund, and Yokozuna.  The WWE Championship was defended by Bret Hart against Yokozuna but was most memorable for what happened afterwords that resulted in history being made while the other main event featured the return after a year of Hulk Hogan teaming with Brutus Beefcake challenging Tag Team Champions Money Inc. in what would end up being Hogan's last WrestleMania for close to a decade. Other matches include Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Tatanka, Steiner Brothers vs. Headshrinkers, Crush vs. Doink The Clown where everyone ended up having ""double vision"", Bob Backlund vs. Razor Ramon, Mr. Perfect's last WrestleMania match vs. Lex Luger, and Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales.

""Ten Years In The Making"" marked the 10th edition (not anniversary like they promoted it) of WrestleMania returning home to Madison Square Garden & was the beginning of a new era because many of the past long term names attached with not just WrestleMania but WWE as a company were either retired from in-ring competition or gone completely including Hulk Hogan, Gene Okerland, Ted Dibiase, Bobby Heenan, ect. making room for a ""New Generation"" of atheltes to take the spotlight. Celebrities include Jenny Garth, Donnie Walberg, Rhonda Sheer, Burt Reynolds, ""President Clinton,"" President Of The Hair Club For Men Sy Sperling who debuted the ""new"" Howard Finkel, and Little Richard performing ""America The Beautiful."" This event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various legends like Jerry Lawler, Alundra Blayze/Madusa, Johnny Polo/Raven, Jim Cornette, and Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash.  The WWE Championship was defended twice in one night with the first championship match being Lex Luger's long-awaited SummerSlam rematch against WWE Champion Yokozuna with Mr. Perfect as the special guest referee in a back & forth contest with the winner going on to face Bret Hart later in the night with Roddy Piper as the referee that had Piper taking matters into his own hands at times the only way ""Rod Rod"" knows how that ended in a celebration. The match that ""stole the show"" at this event was the first ever PPV Ladder Match with Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship with both men's title belts hanging from the top in what was definitely groundbreaking for it's time as nobody has ever seen a match like that before to the point where people point to this match as the beginning of earning the nickname ""Mr. WrestleMania."" The other memorable match from this event was the opening match were the two Hart brothers in Bret & Owen had a very technical wrestling match with emotion & storytelling that was definitely the career making moment for Owen Hart as ""he didn't just step out, he jumped out of the shadow."" The most out of control match on the card was the Falls Count Anywhere Match with Randy Savage vs. Crush that went from the isleway to ringside back to the backstage area in what would turn out to be the final WrestleMania appearance of ""The Macho Man."" Other matches include Doink & Dink vs. Bam Bam Bigelow & Luna Vachon a mixed tag match, Alundra Blayze defending the Womens Championship vs. Leilani Kai, Tag Team Champions Quebeckers vs. Men On A Mission, and Earthquake vs. Adam Bomb.

WrestleMania VI was definitely remembered for the main event but the rest of the card had it's memorable moments like Dusty Rhodes solo Mania match, Ms. Elizabeth's appearance, Roddy Piper being his usual controversial self, and Andre's last match while the undercard action itself was more solid than the previous year.  WrestleMania VII was the first WrestleMania I can recall where a majority of the matches from the main events to the undercard had a buildup to it as all the matches were solid while others did their job along with giving us some WrestleMania moments that still stand out to this day.  The first half of WrestleMania VII was perfect as it was a very strong card from top to bottom delivering everything as far as entertainment, in-ring wrestling, and emotion but the second half of the card really ended the show on a flat note with the bad booking & the ending to the main event being very confusing while looking back at how the show ended a year later coming off like a bad dream as nothing they set up for the future lasted long.  The in-ring product was really suffering around WrestleMania IX as the best matches on the card where the first two opening ones while the other matches were either solid at best, served their purpose, or just very short.  WrestleMania X was about as perfect of a WrestleMania as you were going to get as he had solid matches from technical wrestling to brawling, entertainment, and various memorable moments.  You really start to see not just the show but WWE evolve & change each year so it's a great volume to have in your collection.",1157328000,18,11302,4.914570230607967
2414942,5,B000BDH6I0,"I waited a long time for the WWE to release WrestleMania I-XIV on DVD.  I must say that overall I was not disappointed.  Each WrestleMania is shown in its entirety (with the exception of WrestleMania XI).  The WrestleMania DVDs show the original television broadcasts.  I owned just about every WrestleMania in their original VHS format.  The older tapes of the shows they released were heavily edited in order to fit the program on one cassette.  They even edited some matches to make them shorter.  The only way you could see all these matches in their entirety was to watch the original television broadcasts ... until now!

Now, here is what is what is wrong with the DVD sets:

-Entrance music for a lot of Superstars is dubbed over with crappy, generic music so the WWE would not have to pay royalties to use these songs.

-Any verbal reference to WWF is edited out

-WrestleMania XIV-X8 blurs out the WWF scratched logo

-The Salt N' Pepper performance at WrestleMania XI was completely taken out so the WWE would not have to pay them royalties

-There are no extra features whatsoever ... just the event itself for every WrestleMania

I hated that all this great entrance music was taken out.  The edited out the entrance music to Slick's ""Jive Soul Bro,"" HillBilly Jim's ""Country Boy,"" Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Demolition, Big Boss Man's ""Hard Time,"" and Ric Flair's original entrance music to name just a few.  I really miss ""Jive Soul Bro!""  I would have shelled out more dough for these DVDs if they ensured all the old theme music was included.  The blurred out WWF scratched logo is annoying but bearable.

Personally, I only purchased the first three box sets of WrestleMania I-XV because I already owned WresteMania XV-21 on DVD.  If you would prefer to own copies without all the WWF references edited out, I recommend you do the same and try to buy the original WresteleMania DVD releases off of Amazon or eBay for XV-21.  Plus, you miss out on a ton of DVD extras that the original DVD releases are packed with.

Regardless of the gigs I give this box set, I highly recommend to add these DVDs to your collection if you are a professional wrestling fan.  Every single match and interview is shown in its entirety.  Plus, it is the only way you will get these classic WrestleMania's in DVD format.",1142726400,8,2320,4.671604938271605
2414943,5,B000BDH6I0,"At last, here it is. Every WrestleMania to date. Volume 2 features WrestleMania's 6-10. They are on 5 separate discs, the first 2 of which are double sided, & all appear to be in their entirety. On the plus side, there is very little visual editing, except a few signs here & there that actually say ""WWF"". Logos however are not blurred. Another plus - Jesse Ventura's commentary is in tact. However, no WW'E' disc these days would be complete without some kinda editing though, & most here is in the audio area, in particular entrance music. Demolition, Akeem, Big Bossman, & Jimmy Snuka (I think that's it) all have their music replaced with generic guitar riffs, & Howard Finkle's announcing is redone for those particular guys, making it sound more like a video game announcer.

There are some incredible moments in this WrestleMania set that still sent shivers down my spine, & I'd like to share some of those moments:
WrestleMania VI - I was a huge fan of Demolition & the Ultimate Warrior. Demolition winning the Tag Title for the 3rd time & the epic Title for Title match still give me goosebumps.
WrestleMania VII - Another Warrior moment (& more shivers) in the Retirement Match vs Randy Savage.
WrestleMania VIII - Bret Hart vs Roddy Piper almost made me cry, along with Randy Savage recapturing the Heavyweight Title, & the brief return if the Warrior to help the 'retiring' Hulk Hogan from a 2 sided attack.
WrestleMania IX - Honestly, not too much sticks out here. I was actually hoping Yokozuna would hold the title for a little longer than the few seconds that he did.
WrestleMania X - Bret Hart pulls double duty, putting on an amazing match against his brother to open the event, & a Heavyweight Title win to close the event, plus the amazing Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Title.

In all, I can't complain. Entrance music editing aside, these were very nicely done. Quite highly recommended.",1131235200,6,1917,4.736526946107785
