7865068,5,6304197969,A classic. I bought it as a gift for my family since it's been a tradition to enjoy it together for years before we lost the tape during a move. Would recommend to anyone.,1454025600,,171,4.0588235294117645
7865069,5,6304197969,"This Mr. Bean tape has two episodes on it: ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean"" and ""Mr. Bean in Room 426"".  In ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean"", Mr. Bean celebrates Christmas in his own inimitable style.  It begins with him going out to do some holiday shopping, and he winds up doing all sorts of various things, including conducting a Christmas band.  (Trust me, you do NOT want to miss this part.)

The next day, which is Christmas, Mr. Bean invites his girlfriend Irma over for Christmas dinner, and he winds up ""putting the turkey on""... in more ways than one.

I won't give away any more than that.

In ""Mr. Bean In Room 426"", Mr. Bean is staying in a hotel, but after he arrives, he finds himself in numerous predicaments: the room doesn't have a bathtub, the manager is a complete fusspot, and the oysters in the dining room make him ill.

Even so, things seem to be going smoothly enough... until night falls and he gets locked out of his room.  What happens next I won't give away.

In conclusion, this Mr. Bean tape is extremely amusing (like always), and it's definitely worth buying.",1124236800,4,1083,4.541237113402062
7865070,5,6304197969,"There are basically two categories of people out there, Mr. Bean fans, and non-Mr. Bean fans.  I'm a fan, my wife is not, but the Christmas segments in this video even had her rolling on the floor.  Definitely one of my favorites, especially for the holiday season.",1005696000,6,265,4.617021276595745
7865071,3,6304197969,"Including the classic episode Merry Christmas Mr Bean, this selection is among the better tapes in this series. Unfortunately, the overall impression decreases becauses of the other sketch where Mr Bean fools around in a hotel - and this, in the end, just becomes too long and too much.",976060800,3,286,4.857142857142857
7865072,5,6304197969,"Amazing, Rowan Atkinson never ceases to amaze me! This tape has numerous comical scenes, my favorite of which is conducting a band during Christmas time.  A definite must have for any Bean fan!",914976000,4,193,4.848484848484849
