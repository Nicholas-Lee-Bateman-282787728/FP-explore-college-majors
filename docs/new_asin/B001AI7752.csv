8277562,5,B001AI7752,this show is awesome and a must see.  It is on Netflix instant watch that's where saw it.  If you guys are like me and LOVE Patricia Arquette's acting with her Southern-tinged voice that is so sexy and her strawberry blonde hair.  I love TV shows like CSI and Criminal minds and Medium is right up there,1359244800,,303,4.280701754385965
8277563,5,B001AI7752,"I liked Medium when I purchased this set but I wouldn't call myself a fan.  I have really enjoyed seeing it from the beginning and have a new appreciation for the series.  My husband, who never liked Medium, has even commented on the consistant quality of the script writing.  The price on this set makes it a great buy if only for the shear number of hours of viewing.  It will be a long time before I can complain that I have nothing good to watch.",1274054400,,450,4.1976744186046515

8277565,5,B001AI7752,"We didn't start watching Medium until a few months ago, so catching up on all the past seasons has really been entertaining.  The ability to see a show and also hear comments from the producer was a plus.",1244678400,,204,4.368421052631579
8277566,5,B001AI7752,"I had not watched this show until recently, but a prolonged illness has had me ""reviewing"" a lot of television. One of the best shows out there is Medium.  The acting and writing are terrific.  There are so few shows that show a sustained, loving relationship between a husband and wife.  Frankly, I can't think of any and there are few in fiction as well.  Usually a show or a book series stops cold when a couple get married, because ""marriage isn't exciting past the courtship"". However, Medium consistently shows a wonderful family life that is not quite too good to be true.  I don't know if there is a real Joe Dubois out there, but Allison has it made.  I also love the kids, the humor, the mysteries, and, of course, the paranormal aspects of the show as well.  In simple it is a wonderful, intelligent show and I hope the writers and production team can keep up the good work for a few more years.  I bought the series so I can enjoy the shows whenever I wish, commercial free.  It was worth it and I will buy all new seasons as they come to market as well.",1243209600,,1066,4.29
8277567,5,B001AI7752,"I cannot praise this show highly enough.  For me it is the best network drama on television and has been ever since its very first episode in season one.  This show definitely shows what bringing A++ caliber film stars to television can achieve.  Patricia Arquette has always been an exemplary actress and always has tackled very demanding movies in a wide range of independant films.  (She also starred in the second installment of the Nightmare On Elm Street series which is a hoot to watch.)  But Patricia Arquette is a true artist and acting in her hands is a true craft.

Medium since the beginning has played out like a film brought to television.  There are stories in each episode but also an underlying plot and theme that has carried out throughout all for seasons.  It is one, exceptional, continuous drama becoming more involving with each episode.

The show is intellingent, scary and handles the main premise of Alison being able to receive messages from the dead with seriousness and true credibility.  The show is never gimicky.  We follow Alsion throughout all the seasons as she learns how to use her gift and how it affects her life.  This show also shows an excellent realistic portrayal of an average middle class family.  Alison, her husband Joe and the three kids are excellently cast and very believable.

The entire cast of this show is exemplary and all are given an opportunity to shine but it does rest highly on the shoulders of Patricia Arquette.  She is practically in every scene.  Patricia has also won an Emmy for her performance in this series and been nominated every year.  Without her the heart and soul of the show would be gone.

This four season set is an amazing deal.  I have purchased each season as it came out but for those who haven't purchased any yet or want to get an introduction to the show purchasing them in this bulk offer is much cheaper than purchasing them all individually.

This show is one that once viewed must be owned.  You will want to watch the episodes over and over for it is so complex there is always something new to discover.  So for quality drama, acting and amazing suspense and scares done to the highest caliber this series is a must.

Alison DuBois is based on a real person and to travel along her journey is an amazing treat.  Highly recommend.",1220140800,,2323,4.637254901960785
