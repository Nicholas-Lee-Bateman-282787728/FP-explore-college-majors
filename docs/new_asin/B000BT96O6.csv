2440483,4,B000BT96O6,"I enjoyed this Documentary on Sheriff Joe Arpaio. I believe in his way of law enforcement, maybe we should have more sheriffs/law enforcers like him. People have a choice in life and if they break the law they should be held accountable for their actions. Keep up the good work Sheriff.",1152921600,9,286,4.627450980392157
8092194,5,B000BT96O6,"I know Joe from living in Phoenix, the book is good. But the man is better than the book. If you ever meet he in person he's nothing like the media portrays.",1454198400,,157,3.9375
8092195,5,B000BT96O6,"Admire Sheriff Arpaio and only see him on an occasional interview.  Bought two of these, one for my brother,  Done very well.",1437436800,,125,4.636363636363637
8092196,5,B000BT96O6,It's Joe. why would it not be good.,1409961600,,35,3.5
8092197,5,B000BT96O6,I got it for my husband and he absolutely loved it! I love Arpaio and I strongly believe in his methods!,1363564800,2,104,4.0
8092198,3,B000BT96O6,"I have been in law enforcement for 15 years... spent 2 years of that working for this man.  Let me tell you, he is a pompus showboating pig.  That being said, this video does give the perfect debate prompts.  The discussions in class that followed this video were great.

Instructor aware note:  There is a brief moment of nudity in this video at the biker scene in which breasts are shown in full frontal.  Probably not a big deal for college but this was high school.  (OOPS!)",1327190400,,478,4.425287356321839
8092199,5,B000BT96O6,"I ordered this video for a Police Recruit Class that I teach. I have shown this in every class for the past two years. It is a great video. I respect this sheriff very and his ways on  how he does things. He tells it like it is and it shows because he has been elected many times. If you can recall he is the sheriff who put inmates in tents, and changed the clothes on what the inmates where. He also cut down on lunches savings thousands of dollars fot the county. Overall I think it is worth buying and it should be noted he still is the sheriff as of tody (10-22-11)",1319241600,,570,4.0
8092200,5,B000BT96O6,"We need more law enforcement officers like this guy.  Criminals don't need to be pampered at the tax payers cost.  If they have a rough time in jail, they won't want to go back and that's the way it should be!",1278720000,,209,4.073170731707317
8092201,5,B000BT96O6,"This film begins to tell the real story of Joe Arpaio from the context of a lawman who in his own words ""went from a lawman to a celebrity."" In this film you will watch someone beaten to death by Arpaio's officers. In this film you will see Arpaio's guards say under oath that while other guards were strangling a detainee (not formally charged, not having had a trial, not even had a preliminary hearing, not proven guilty of anything) that Scott Norberg was turning blue from strangulation, they were told in response ""Who gives a F***."" You will see convincing evidence of a jail guard cover up and Arpaio says his ""guards did nothing wrong.""

This is the type of lawman Joe Arpaio is. This is what he does and this is what has cost Maricopa County taxpayers $50M in lawsuit losses during Arpaio's tenure in office.

If you want to see how absolute power corrupts absolutely, then this is the film for you. Kudos to the director Max Jourdan for doing such a good job in this film on showing Arpaio's true colors.",1238025600,3,1015,4.481081081081081
8092202,5,B000BT96O6,"This is one great story whether you watch it on PBS, read the book or see the DVD.

Personally I believe America should have more Lawmen like Joe Arpaio.",1167955200,4,153,4.275862068965517
8092203,3,B000BT96O6,"I bought this video because I am a Professor of Criminal Justice. I felt it would be interesting to watch and study as part of a Survey of Corrections course.

It turned out to be very interesting- and somewhat disturbing. My personal and professional sides seemed torn between the content and I could see the same reaction in my students. The discussion that came from watching the video was very productive and beneficial to the class.

However, several students were taken aback by one of the inmates stories and as a Professor I feel I should have made them aware of what the video contained.

Arguable one of the better videos for classroom discussion- if your students can handle the content.",1155081600,4,698,4.75206611570248
