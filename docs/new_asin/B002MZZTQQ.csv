8374372,3,B002MZZTQQ,"A killer known as The Hyena of London is caught and hanged. However almost immediately his body goes missing. In a small village outside of London people begin to die in a manner similar to the way the Hyena killed.

Italian Euro-horror shocker that bogs down almost instantly into various love triangles and quadrangles and general romance. More soap opera than horror film the movie never really generates much tension even as its trying to be very Gothic. Not bad as such but I picked this up since it was listed as a horror film and I was expecting thrills and chills not soap. More bland than anything I thought a good deal of this was tedious, though watchable as background noise. The disappointing thing was that many of the revelations seemed to be an after thought.

Ultimately a lesser Euro-shocker from Italy (despite the Anglicized credits).",1382918400,,854,4.802721088435374
