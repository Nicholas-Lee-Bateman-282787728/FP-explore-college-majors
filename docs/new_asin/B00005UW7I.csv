1668855,5,B00005UW7I,"When I saw ""Va Savoir"" in theaters, I loved it so much that I stayed in my seat for the next showing (with the film's lethargic 154-min running time, that's around 5 hours or so) and I enjoyed every second of it. I just love the characters in this film. The way they talk, the dialogue, the situations and places they find themselves in, all of it magical. I do not understand people saying the film is enjoyable, but not heavy or a ""major Rivette"", which I wholeheartedly disagree with (I find this to be Rivette's best work since ""La Belle Noiseuse""). I have seen the film around 6 or 7 times and have yet to tire of it. For anyone looking for a charming, intelligent, hugely entertaining, and romantic movie...this is it. Highly recommended.",1078704000,5,744,4.518518518518518

1668857,1,B00005UW7I,"Now I've seen quite a good share of foreign films. Maybe it is my ignorance on theatrical names and topics in the film, but I could not follow any of it. The characters were very dry and distant. It has a very disappointing ending and the plot is just very slow moving.
Not very highly recommended.",1057276800,6,298,4.339285714285714
1668858,5,B00005UW7I,"This film runs 154 minutes which is about the length of most epics. This however is not an epic and though an excellent story(once it gets going)it will tire and try the patience of even the most devoted Rivette loyalists. I like this film and am glad to have stayed the course with it but Rivette could have given us filmgoers a little more to look at(most shots are interiors of hotels or apartments) for those 2 1/2 hours. That said this film in every other way succeeds and on a very high level.
The story: In true new wave fashion the movie has no real starting point. The characters are at first met at some distance as we see them in their professional roles as actors. Slowly we see them in more relaxed settings and slowly we get to know them. The key word is slowly because for all the attention that must be paid the true payoffs don't start coming til approximately half way through the movie. It takes Rivette awhile (perhaps too long) to set up all the various situations/relationships but once set up the movies pace picks up. The lead actress plays a leading actress and how you feel about this movie will largely be determined by how you feel about her because everything pivots around her. The actress is not particualarly attractive and it takes awhile to begin to find her fascinating but she is that. In love with her director and in love with her ex her main emotion is indeciciveness. Not passion nor desire or anything excting just uncertainty. Interestingly however the other characters are equally indecisive. They are all indecisive in a different way and that makes this film farcical even though you rarely find yourself laughing at this human comedy. What is most memorable about the picture is how well eacg character is brought to us. Rivette is great with detail and nuance and you have to be with a picture like this. Every character has some aspect which will capture your interest and though the plot does not take you anywhere there is an arrival at the end. An arrival at a kind of understanding that allows for peoples complexities to coexist and that makes this film experience a very civilized one.  Rivette makes insightful use of the theatre in Va Savoir. The theatre is the place we ask the big questions about love and identity but life is not written out for us ahead of time so life is the even more uncertain cinema-theatre we actors all occupy. Rivette finds both art and life are richest when in most intimate contact with one another. In the end you will feel enlivened by that spirit of understanding and glad to have given your time to this epic length look at intimacy.",1024963200,7,2623,4.56900212314225
1668859,5,B00005UW7I,"I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable.  The story line is simple and, in some way, rather unimportant - Camille, a well-known Parisian actress, is returning from Rome to act in front of her home audience in a play directed by her new lover Ugo.  The play is Pirandello's Come Tu Mi Vuoi, a classical work (written for his lover Martha Abba) about a woman pinned between the yin and yang forces of reality and illusion.  Throughout the film Rivette switches his camera between the play and Camille and Ugo's  ""reality"" as if to ask us who are the real Camille and Ugo. What do they really want? What makes them tick? Can I, the spectator, enter their scriptless universe? Rivette (and his excellent actors) show us that delicateness can be robust and inventive, that desire for another can never be fulfilled and yet that the fulfillment does not really matter, because in the process of the struggle to achieve it we become alive and creative. What matters is style; style is substance. We are also treated to a brilliant depiction of the incestuous relationship between the Italians and the French and there is a delicious succession of nuances, hints and plays with the national stereotypes that  brought many a smile to my face.
I can see why some - those used to Hollywood cliches with their happy endings and oh so predictable plots - might not find the movie to be that hot.  Well, that's just too bad....",1023926400,6,1413,4.67741935483871
1668860,4,B00005UW7I,"I have one criterion for judging movies: Good ones, like good music, good food, and good sex get better the more you do them. I didn't say perfect. But then there has never been a perfect film or a perfect anything created by a human being, has there?
""Va Savoir,"" an idiom which I would rather translate into ""go figure"" rather than the parenthetical ""who knows?"" you find in every reference to this French version of a modern Shakepearean comedy where all the knots and tangles created by human ineptitude and benevolent chance are harmoniously resolved by the final act, is a good film. I've seen it three times and have enjoyed each viewing for different reasons.
  One is the language. I should say languages. Please see the undubbed version so you can hear the sonorous prosody of Italian contrasted with the tubular perscussiveness of French spoken by the bilingual cast.
  I like everyone's face. Every one is natural.
  There's nothing gross about the way love and affection are expressed. It's subtle and funny. The music doesn't get in the way.
  It has a happy ending.",1020902400,3,1080,4.768817204301075
1668861,1,B00005UW7I,"well since there are varied types of reviews on this film here i figured id chime in. this film is incredibly boring, completely uninteresting, the main character does nothing but whine, and when you finally find out what about you want to smack the crap out of her for dragging you into her incredibly mundane over-yet-underdramatized world. none of the characters are vaguely interesting and it runs slower than a snails pace. i generally love french cinema but i saw this one... i think im staying away from anything french for awhile. thank god for jeunet and caro, and films such as the dreamlife of angels. stay away from this. anyone giving this film any decent kind of review has a great deal of pretension about them. absolutely unredeeming crap.",1016582400,7,755,4.815384615384615
7955528,1,B00005UW7I,"Boring beyond description. I confess I didn't finish it. Life's to short to waste a whole three hours on a pointless, self-indulgent film full of archly unconvincing characters, like this turkey.
About 90 mins in, I realised that although my eyes were still facing the screen, the rest of me was far, far away. So nothing for it but to switch off and toss the DVD into the ""for the Oxfam Shop"" bag I keep in the front hallway.",1503273600,,426,4.405063291139241
7955529,5,B00005UW7I,"This is one of Rivette's last films; it continues his exploration of mystery and secrets held by the main characters. I found Ugo's obsessive search for the missing Goldoni manuscript to be compelling and well worked out. The broken love affair between Pierre and Camille is also well drawn--he seems more threatening than he really is, as we find out in the course of the story. As ever with Rivette, there's a play being put on, and the actors must show us all the joys and sorrows of the profession. At one point Ugo despairs of making any money out of the tour; I suppose he isn't getting any government grants. I give this 5/5, it holds my attention throughout.",1454716800,2,666,4.558333333333334
7955530,2,B00005UW7I,"Emmanuelle Beart is in this movie and she is very beautiful.  So much for the high point of this movie.  This is a musical as performed by your local High School plus one pretty lady.  The ""Mystery"" is obvious and, thus, not much of a mystery.  This is a French film in French with English subtitles.  If you want to practice listening and understanding spoken and sung French then watch this movie.  For all others this movie is a waste of time. Catherine Deneuve was for this movie and still is - fat.  It happens to us all.",1444694400,,526,4.3061224489795915
7955531,5,B00005UW7I,I liked it as the 4th movie to use the song Sensa Fine at the very end. It made the film for me.,1411603200,,96,3.217391304347826
7955532,4,B00005UW7I,"This French romantic comedy kept my interest mostly due to the twists of the various relationships and the overall fine performances by the cast.  The plot/story was hard for me to follow until 30-40 minutes into the movie due to 2 factors: (1) the frequent changes between the scenes of the touring play and the off-stage lives of the main characters with the other members of the cast and (2) the very slow pace of the first part of the story.  I found Jeanne Balibar's & Sergio Castellito's performances to be excellent, and that helped me to accept more easily the ambiguity of the story line.  I liked the film so much that when I finished watching it once, I watched the first 30-40 minutes of it again so I could enjoy that part of the film more than I did on my first viewing.  While that worked for me, I consider it to be a shortcoming of the film in general.  I also think that I would have enjoyed the film more if it had been carefully edited to be about 30 minutes shorter.",1199232000,2,987,4.313513513513514
7955533,4,B00005UW7I,"This French ensemble romantic comedy revolves around six people who lie, cheat and steal their way around Paris over the course of several increasingly zany days, culminating in a duel.  The fact that it takes place in the present day should give you an idea of how kooky the characters become!  All six of them (three men and three women) are connected to one another somehow, and over the course of putting on a play they manage to get into more nutty situations than you can shake a baguette at.  It's quite funny and a very light foray into the cheerful world of romance and Paris.  Worth watching if you can find a copy.",1197417600,,625,4.456140350877193
7955534,5,B00005UW7I,"Va Savoir is one of my favorite international films. The humor alone always gets me. It's not a comedy nor a ""dramedy."" It's just about human relationships. Sure, all movies are about human relationships. However, this movie's narrative is compelling and the chemistry between the actors makes it humorous. Everything takes place around or behind a play. The main characters are actors in a traveling theatre troupe. The director and leading lady are stereotypically in love. However, it seems that their love is more an enduring friendship than a physical affair. All of the main characters are searching for something. If it is not a long lost play by an Italian playwright it's long lost dreams...",1167782400,4,700,5.043103448275862
7955535,3,B00005UW7I,"At 154 (!) minutes, ""Va Savoir"" could use about about 40+ minutes of judicious editing.  I'm open to French cinematic experiences - there's nothing like the thrill of discovering gems like ""Read My Lips"" or ""The Dinner Game"" - but at 2 hours 30 minutes plus, director Jacques Rivette here strains the patience of even the most hardened of cinephiles.

That's not to say it isn't fun to watch Jeanne Balibar ooze her way across the screen - she's such a silky-smooth, enchanting presence.  And it's a treat to see Sergio Castellitto, who was spectacular in the winning 'Mostly Martha.'  And how about an actor who can play leads in German (as he did in 'Martha') and Italian and French (he does both with aplomb here in 'Va Savoir')?  This is one talented guy.  But condensing the film down to a tighter 1 hr 45 minutes would have greatly increased the viewing experience.

Also, viewers should take care not to get freaked out during the first 1 - 2 minutes of the film.  It's in Italian, and the filmmakers (or its distributors?) don't start the subtitling until Camille (Balibar, on stage in the film, emoting in Italian) steps off stage and out of character and says ""In French now.""  And, viola, at that point the subtitles kick in.  It's a cute little effect, but it'll drive you crazy with your clicker if you're not aware of it.",1125187200,8,1335,4.594936708860759
7955536,3,B00005UW7I,"Va Savoir is one of those films I might have liked a lot more had it featured a different leading lady, but Jeanne Balibar's listless and affected performance - like some hyperactive simpleton doped up to the eyeballs going through their full repertoire of irritating mannerisms in extreme slow motion - sucked the life out of every scene she's in. What's more, she's horribly overindulged by director Jacques Rivette, whose pacing often seems to take her lead and drags scenes out far beyond their natural lifespan just so she can slowly, dreamily roll her eyes up heavenward while smiling like an idiot another three times for no discernible reason. While a certain degree of affectation might have suited the character, this is in the realms of the absurd, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast are excellent and the film has a lot going for it whenever she's offscreen. The ending in particular, where the various characters find themselves on stage as the plots and possibilities are casually resolved, is quietly marvellous.",1121817600,,1039,4.942857142857143
7955537,1,B00005UW7I,"One could consider this film like a cinematic whole-wheat pancake.  Your film comes topped with butter, syrup, and all the fruits you can think of (the characters of the film).  When it is presented originally Va Savoir looks tantalizingly delicious, but after ten minutes of eating you realize that you finished and still hungry.  You realize that this mound of goodness was nothing more than fluffy cooked dough that will ultimately make you fat, lazy, and sleepy.  While it may give you a high at first, the darkness of the inevitable ""sugar-low"" is fast approaching and causing you to grab your stomach in disgust.  Also, it was a flop.  Perhaps that was a bit overboard, but I really wanted to explain this film in a way that was a bit more entertaining than the film itself.  To put it bluntly, this film was like watching the grass grow in your back yard in anticipation of having to mow it again.  It was slow, not very colorful, and a pain to sit through.  When it finally gets too long, it hurts too much to do it again, but you know it must be done.  That feeling is exactly how I felt about the film Va Savoir.

This is a devoutly character based film.  To make a deeply rooted character based film to work, you must first have exciting characters that you know your audience is going to want to follow.  Sadly, this was not the case in this film.  From the opening scene (where the subtitles were not working on my DVD) all the way till the final moments of the film, we have to follow four of the dullest characters in cinematic history.  Cammille is our pilot, following an emotion and feeling that is never quite developed in the story and therefore never quite developed in her.  Her mannerisms and reactions to situations made me feel as if she was a bit on the loony side.  Perhaps it was the way that Jeanne Balibar chose to play her, but there was nothing making me believe that Cammille was a very strong character.  Her actions throughout the film prove that much, but what are her motives and reasonings?  That is never explained or developed, yet there was three hours to do it.  Strange.  This goes the same for Sonia, who I also never really fully grasped onto.  She seemed to be in love, but at the same time enjoying moments with Arthur.  Her need to rearrange made me think that her and Cammille had similar personalities (loony), which is what made them become friends near the end.  Yet, again, it was never explained.  We, the audience, were forced to follow a lot of assumptions in this film, and whenever we felt that we fully understood and connected with a character, Rivette would pull us further away.  It was as if he never really wanted us to fully understand them, but still accept them.  That didn't brood well with me.

Couple this with random intermissions of the play that these performers are putting on for the Parisians only helps to confuse the audience.  I couldn't tell if Cammille was actually acting in the play or just walking through the lines.  Half the time it looked as if it bothered her to be there.  There was no emotion or excitement when she was on stage prompting me to question whether she was this ""infamous"" actress that they claimed her to be.  I have seen several foreign films in my lifetime, but this one takes the cake as possibly the longest passenger car to Dullsville.  I had trouble understanding the play that was happening throughout the film, thus causing me to care less about the characters.  The final thirty minutes of this movie are actually fun.  The scenes where Pierre and Ugo decide to duel are hysterical.  I actually watched this scene over again because I enjoyed it so much.  The connections made at the end tied the film up nicely, but still left too many questions unanswered.

Overall, I was lost in this film.  If you ever pick up this film and you see a blonde-hair, blue-eyes 26-year old wandering through the scenes, it is I just trying to understand this film.  I can't figure it out, I can understand most Lynch, Gilliam, and others of the ""jigsaw puzzle"" genre, but this was just beyond my control.  The characters seemed drab and never fully comfortable in their roles, and those that were jumped between emotions like playing leapfrog in kindergarten.  The stories were connected well, but it didn't make any difference if the characters (the glue of the stories) didn't hold them together.  In your eyes, and in your DVD player, you can see where this film just falls apart.  If you are looking for a stronger emotional powerhouse film where characters work with their characters and push the envelope even further, I would check out Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia.  This film reminded me of Magnolia except bad.

I don't suggest anyone wasting their three hours on this film, but who am I except a lost guy in this film.

Again, if found, please return!

Grade: * out of *****",1100563200,6,4884,4.5790080738177625
