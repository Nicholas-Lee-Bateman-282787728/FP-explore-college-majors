8270129,5,B0018MUU6I,"I have watched these videos over 100 times and they are a very good start.  However the SPORT of bjj has evolved since Rorion made these tapes.  If your just starting out and there is no one to teach you these tapes are great, but there is no substitute for a master and avoid mma gyms because no-gi is not jiu jitsu.  Try a gracie affiliate with someone who is a real black belt not a guy who bought one.  If your in P.A. try Gracie Philly!!!!!",1333065600,,445,4.080459770114943
8270130,3,B0018MUU6I,"These DVD's are professionally produced and very well put together.  I bought them on the recommendation of BJJ practitioners, to clear up the ""misconceptions"" which were responsible for my dislike of BJJ.

If you are specifically interested in BJJ, or you are interested in becoming a ""MMA"" competitor, these DVD's are an excellent value and I'm sure that you will learn much from them.  If you consider yourself a MARTIAL artist--that is, you are seeking the skills to best enable you to survive in a life-or-death situation, there is nothing for you here.  I'm not going to stump for a specific system, nor is this the place for technical/tactical argument against BJJ.",1225756800,4,672,4.973214285714286
