293326,3,6300217604,Condition wasn't very good - doesn't play as well as would like for the price.  Would like to have found a better quality VHS or a DVD,1356998400,2,134,3.962962962962963
293327,5,6300217604,"A friend of my mother taped it from TV for her, and then my mother loaned it to me.  Quite a few years ago, I purchased the movie and then lent it to someone else, who moved away without returning it to me.  I'd really like to have it again, but the new price here is unreasonable, especially in this economic climate.  What I'd like to know is, when is someone going to put it on DVD?

This is a very nice, unexpected romance movie, with none of the unnecessary, obscene sweaty bodies rolling around mindlessly in bed.  Marilu Henner's performance is mostly very fine, but occasionally a bit forced.  Daniel Massey (yes, the son of the late, great Raymond Massey, although Daniel lived with his mother after his parents' divorce) shows just the right amount of cynicism and curmudgeonlyness (if that's a word).  He's curt but cute.

Please, Amazon, put some pressure on someone to put this movie on DVD!",1324684800,4,904,4.571428571428571

293329,5,6300217604,"This movie is a must-have! I bought this on impulse, and never regretted it! Marilu Henner and Daniel Massey are such a dynamic romantic duo! I have this movie and I adore it ... one of my favorites!",1196640000,,199,4.2631578947368425
293330,5,6300217604,"First of all I really like Marilu Henner. This film was like a Cinderella story & the Prince. Altho this Prince at first was not the handsomest in looks, his acting convinced one he was the handsomest ever and really fell in love for the first time. It was very romantic.",1123286400,5,271,4.333333333333333
293331,5,6300217604,"I first saw this movie on the old satellite channel, Romance Classics. It was one drizzly afternoon and I had the day off from work. Channel surfing, I happened upon this little gem. I watched it in its entirety and walked away from it kind of amazed at my ability to have survived the thing. I think it was the cheese factor that glued me to my seat for those 98 minutes. This movie became the movie that I refer to whenever having one of those ""cheesiest movie of all time"" conversations.

Flash forward 3 years; I come across the movie for 99 cents in a used record store. With a delighted squeal, I purchase immediately. Finally; the evidence to back up my claims of it's cheesiness! I force my new husband to watch it that weekend.

It has become the litmus test for compatible sense of humor with all new friends. It gets funnier every time I watch it. It is to the romance genre what ""Flash"" is to sci-fi. If you've never heard of ""Flash"", this movie may not be the jolly treat for you that it has been for me.",1111708800,2,1017,4.2642487046632125
293332,5,6300217604,"THIS MOVIE MADE ME LAUGH, IT WAS SUSPENSEFUL AND CLEVER.  IT WAS EXTREMLEY ROMANTIC.  IT ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE A TEMPORARY ESCAPE FROM THE DAILY STRESS OF LIFE.  IT MAKES YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU HAVE TRAVELED ABROAD.  ITS A WONDERFUL MOVIE.",1077235200,8,236,4.5476190476190474
293333,5,6300217604,I love this movie. I originally saw it in the 80's when it was on TV. It has always been one of my favorite romantic movies so I bought it for my collection. I watched it a few days after I received it and it was better than ever. I recommend this for any couple who wants to watch it together and get that romance back in their lives.,1002067200,8,335,3.869565217391304
293334,5,6300217604,"This movie will warm your heart.  Well worth watching when you think that all is lost in the love and romance department.  Brings a smile to your face and heart.  I would recommend for all ages.  Great family movie.  Up lifts the spirt!.  They should do a sequel.  You never know what's going to happen next.  Daniel Massey was made for the part, as was Marilu Henner. The locations were wonderful and fit perfectly with the story line.  More, More!!",973468800,19,450,4.525

Many years ago my family and I watched this movie on TV whilst holidaying in Scotland.  We managed to purchase a vhs copy which we now can no longer view so we keep looking up this film on Amazon almost daily in the hope that we will be able to purchase a dvd copy of this magical movie.  The actors and the scenery are excellent and the story line is so touching that by the end of the film, we find we have wet eyes.  We can't wait to see it again.  Please release this movie as soon as possible and you will have a definite sale from us - of course we mean at a reasonable price so everyone can afford to buy it. from Scotia Gordon",1484265600,2,668,3.955223880597015

7808228,4,6300217604,"Love With A Perfect Stranger is also one of my all time favorite movies. I am a romantic and love the Harlequin series and even though I have the film taped, I was hoping to find it on DVD. I believe that this is a classic love story. Old time and humorous. It reminds me of a fairy tale.",1373155200,2,288,3.8983050847457625
7808229,5,6300217604,"The cover of this item states this is a ""Harlequin Romance Movie"", which should give you a pretty good idea of what this film is all about. Harlequins are very formulaic, so any expectations of this film need to take that into consideration. Also, the entire thing is very 80s! Overall, it is extremely romantic and exceedingly sweet, a very light, but highly entertaining bit of fluff. It is beautifully photographed in both Ireland and Italy, so it offers a gorgeous travelogue style, very pretty to look at. Of course, there are the requisite fine clothes - Henner's character is a fashion designer. There is a train ride on a glamorous, to-die-for train. The love interests meet ""cute"", with Henner's character initially disliking Massey. There is even a light bit of espionage, with the emphasis on light. It won't be a challenge to figure out what is going on. Marilu Henner is a fine actress, and is just that in this film - fine. The real attraction to watch this is Daniel Massey. I defy anyone to watch this movie and not fall in love! Charming, witty, intelligent, determined, and so much fun! I have loved this film for years and high recommend it!",1370736000,2,1160,4.6911764705882355
