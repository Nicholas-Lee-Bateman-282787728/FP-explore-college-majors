I bought this dvd based on another Amazon Member review and they were right on the money! This is gorgeous, with a cracking fire, lush reds and greens, a beautiful setting.

Like an old fashioned Christmas. It's just gorgeous and lush. I only need the aroma of a cracking fire, to complete the package.

Highly recommended.......beautiful and worth every penny.",1374969600,,619,7.226666666666667

8494908,5,B0068O21OK,Got this last year and have already cranked it up again.  Awesome for those who don't have a fireplace but have a big screen TV.  You can choose from 4 different fireplace setups and can choose to have the Christmas music playing along with the fireplace sounds or can just use the fireplace crackling sounds.  You can even have it silent and just enjoy the visual effect.  Love it while reading.  We have a fireplace which is way to messy and smelly - doesn't function well and don't want to spend the money to fix.  My genius husband put a spare television inside the fireplace with this DVD running the fire and then put the firescreen over it.  Had it running in the evening light and fooled a few neighbors enough they went over to warm themselves.  Hilarious!! I am buying another one for a different room.,1353628800,4,812,4.476190476190476
