8693172,5,B00QWN9U7I,"Based on Joan G. Robinson's novel of the same name, although it transposes the setting from Norfolk, England from the original novel to Sapporo, don't expect a light hearted Studio Ghibli film! This is more akin to Grave of the Fireflies and is equally as emotionally affecting.

Visually beautiful as expected of any Ghibli work.
A stunning film that is a must have in any Studio Ghibli collection! 5/5",1466553600,,403,4.840579710144928
8693173,4,B00QWN9U7I,"Directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi (The Secret World of Arrietty) from a screenplay by Yonebayashi, Keiko Niwa and Masashi Ando, When Marnie Was There is the latest film from Studio Ghibli.  Based on the 1967 novel of the same name by Joan G. Robinson, When Marnie Was There tells the story of Anna, a twelve-year-old girl who spends a summer out in a small rural seaside town where she's been sent for her health.  And where she comes across an old house and a mystery that tug at her for some reason.

My only problem with When Marnie Was There was that I found the pacing to be overly slow, particularly in the first half of the film.  The result is that while the run-time is only 103 minutes, which is actually shorter than some other recent Studio Ghibli films like The Tale of the Princess Kaguya and The Wind Rises, it felt longer

Recommended for anyone who loves Studio Ghibli animation.",1434067200,4,895,4.53416149068323
