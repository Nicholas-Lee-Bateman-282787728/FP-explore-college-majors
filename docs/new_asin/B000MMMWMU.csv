2737085,5,B000MMMWMU,I found this dynamic approach quite exhilarating. Very different from traditionally recommended yoga postures for depression.,1227571200,2,125,6.875
2737086,5,B000MMMWMU,"This is set in a beautiful park-like of wide open grass/trees, cacti & mountain in the back in Tucson, AZ. Amy Weintraub alone demonstrating & using voice over. The production quality is well done for all aspects. Amy has a very non self-conscious, new age style that demands you be open, silly (non one's watching) & relax. Amy has great body awareness, great energy that you want to learn from.
Here is the breakdown of the dvd with poses/stretches she spends most on listed. This isn't about working out or sweating, but about being more aware of your body & letting go. The pace is very relaxed & she gives modifications by words & also flashes in/out of video of her doing them.

2737087,3,B000MMMWMU,"I enjoyed Amy Weintraub's book and I love yoga, so I purchased this DVD.  I really like the Joint Opening part, and the seated meditation.  Once the yoga started with the chanting, I just couldn't get into it.  Chanting is not the style of yoga that I enjoy - although others may.  It is a well quality made DVD.  So if you don't mind chanting throughout your yoga, it's for you.  If chanting is not your style, then I would not recommend it.  It's a nice gentle practice.",1202428800,36,472,4.295454545454546
2737088,5,B000MMMWMU,"I loved this DVD. I was suffering from very severe depression/anxiety, and was put on medication. But, until the meds started to work, this DVD got me through. I still do it, as I feel that my mental health is important to maintain on as many levels as possible, and thus I don't leave it up to the meds alone. Again, I can't recommend this highly enough. Thank God for it!!!",1197849600,19,375,4.295774647887324
2737089,5,B000MMMWMU,"Life Force Yoga to Beat the Blues is an all around fabulous yoga DVD whether you suffer from the blues or not.  Amy Weintraub is a fabulous teacher and her instructions are clear and concise.  The magnificent scenery and soothing music make it a feast for the senses.  I own many yoga DVDs but this is an all time favorite!!

2737090,3,B000MMMWMU,"I was somewhat disappointed with this DVD. When I received it, I discovered that many of the exercises are not for people with bipolar disorder (or inflammatory conditions such as IBD)...which would have been good to know before I bought the DVD. Also, I found the Sanskrit music rather annoying. However, the yoga teacher does seem to know about yoga and depression.",1178409600,21,367,4.935483870967742
2737091,5,B000MMMWMU,I found this video very comforting and a great yoga practice as all of the poses and breathing exercises are aimed at helping depression and anxiety. Amy is a lovely teacher! I especially like the joint warm up at the beginning!,1173571200,9,228,4.585365853658536
2737092,5,B000MMMWMU,"LifeForce Yoga to Beat the Blues is beautifully done and uplifting. The practice is easy to follow, and it really improves one's mood, energy level and sense of being ""in balance.""  The opening joint warm-up dance is so much fun and uses great sanskrit music.  Amy Weintraub's descriptions of the breathing practices, yoga poses and yoga flows are excellent.  She also weaves mantra throughout the practice, which adds another dimension.  I would recommend this to anyone, at any level, who wants to improve their sense of physical, mental and emotional well-being.",1171152000,26,565,5.175824175824176
8170086,5,B000MMMWMU,"the best yoga dvd I have ever had. I have sent several copies to others. Very simple, relaxing and easy to do but powerful. It always lifts me when I am having a hard day. Amy's voice is so pleasant and soothing.",1504137600,,212,4.071428571428571
8170087,3,B000MMMWMU,It is a nice DVD but seems to be long. I do not think I will use it very much,1403481600,,77,2.9
8170088,2,B000MMMWMU,"For me personally, I thought all the noises she made were a little too much to handle. Maybe I just lack the confidence needed, but I couldn't make a lot of the noises without feeling weirded out or giggling.

The stretches were fine but I don't think I'll be able to use this disc for it's intended purpose. Was worth the try though, I really liked her book.",1388620800,2,359,4.279411764705882
8170089,3,B000MMMWMU,"Lovely settings for a lovely person doing yoga, a little too quickly for someone to really learn. The presentation is organized well.",1364428800,3,133,5.090909090909091
8170090,5,B000MMMWMU,It works if you do the physical exercise of Yoga plus the special breathing techniques!  I noticed some difference in my mood.  Consider this product before taking meds.  Keep doing it consistantly.,1322956800,3,198,5.125
8170091,5,B000MMMWMU,"I began taking an anti-depressant last summer, and purchased this DVD about a month later.  I did read her book, Yoga for Depression, first and loved it.  At her suggestion, I committed to a daily yoga practice and use this DVD on the weekends when I have more time.  I've now been off my medication for 5 months and am fine.  GREAT TOOL!!!",1313539200,4,340,4.349206349206349
8170092,5,B000MMMWMU,"I came across the book first, and before I could finish it I knew I wanted to try the DVD. I'm so glad that I did!

I am a yoga instructor and long-time yoga practitioner. An unfortunate trend in the Americanization of Hatha yoga is that the subtle energy aspects of the practice often fall by the wayside. Amy uses all of yoga's power in balancing the subtle energies that can have such an impact on mood ""disorders"". The use of the chakra seed sounds is refreshing and uplifting. This practice is easily accessible to those newer to yoga, and a delight to practice with as someone who practices daily.

If you are someone who is uncomfortable with the Sanskrit syllables, you can easily drop them out, but you'll miss out on the benefit that those lovely vibrations bring.

And, as someone who is recovering from a recent major depressive episode, I can say that I'll be practicing with this DVD often. Amy has reminded me that yoga is good medicine!

For those of you who haven't read Amy's book ""Yoga for Depression"", I highly recommend it as well!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-Depression-A-Compassionate-Guide-to-Relieve-Suffering-Through-Yoga/dp/0767914503/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for Depression: A Compassionate Guide to Relieve Suffering Through Yoga</a>",1291161600,7,1325,5.544554455445544
8170093,3,B000MMMWMU,"It is likely that yoga can help alleviate depression, and clearly Amy Weintraub has given a good deal of thought and effort into figuring out how yoga can do that. I think the main drawback to the result of her efforts is that the program is an hour and 20 minutes and is not really a good yoga workout per se. I don't feel I can invest that amount of time in a yoga program that does not really provide the benefits of a yoga along with helping with depressive feelings.",1281139200,7,471,4.186813186813187
8170094,5,B000MMMWMU,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for Metapsychology Online Review; you can find a more complete version of my review on that web site.

This DVD is led by Amy Weintraub, who discovered that the practice of Kripalu yoga alleviated her own depression.  Although it is a fairly gentle practice that is appropriate for beginning level students (although some prior familiarity with the poses would be helpful), Weintraub combines the postures with sounds, a style which may not appeal to everyone.

The entire practice is 75 minutes long.  The chapter points are listed on the DVD case as follows:

1. Introduction
2. Joint Warm-Ups (4.5 minutes)
3. Centering Meditation (6 minutes)
4. Breathing Exercises (7.5 minutes)
5. Warm-Up Poses (19 minutes)
6. Cultivating Will: Standing Poses (12.5 minutes)
7. Will and Willingness: Backbending Poses (6 minutes)
8. Will and Surrender: Forward Bends and Twists (8 minutes)
9. Surrender: Yoga Nidra (11.5 minutes)

Weintraub practices alone outdoors in a bright, grassy, park-like setting. She teaches via voiceover and does not mirror-cue. For the Joint Warm-Ups, which are set against Krishna Das music, Weintraub loosens up the entire body, circling the ankles, knees, and the hips, and ending with a bit of a free-flowing ""dance,"" encouraging you not to worry exactly how you're moving or what you look like. She offers the option of seated or lying for the Centering Meditation (6 minutes), during which she instructs you to focus on your breath as she leads you through the yogic 3-point breath. Weintraub first introduces chanting here, repeating ""ohm"" with the hands together and ""yam"" with the hands over the heart. The Breathing Exercises chapter reviews each of breath kriyas. Weintraub performs a few quick rounds of bellows breath (bhastrika) and skull shining breath (kapalabhati) in a seated position, then moves to standing for the breath of joy; she adds breath retention in-between each of these moves. Weintraub stresses the importance of reading the DVD insert before attempting to perform any of the pranayama.

In the Warm-Up Poses, Weintraub continues to combine mantras with movement, with the opening mountain pose sequence utilizing a bold ""maha ra!"" Coming to the floor, Weintraub moves through a reclined leg series plus thread the needle, and then from an all fours position, she performs a twist and a cat/cow variation that she calls ""flying cow."" This segment concludes with sphinx pose, down dog, and skull shining breath in chair pose. For the Standing Poses, Weintraub begins with a low lunge a chant of mahaha, which is intended to stimulate the heart chakra. This section also includes pyramid pose with the crown chakra sound and a warrior pose variation repeating the maha ra sound. The Backbending Poses consist of a gentle flow with boat (locust), bow, and rabbit postures. The Forward Bends and Twists begin with a full seated forward bend. Next comes one of the most challenging postures of this practice, a reverse plank with skull shining breath. Weintraub finishes this segment with a final round of skull shining breath in a lying twist. The practice concludes with Yoga Nidra, a lengthy, guided deep relaxation.

Weintraub's joy in filming this DVD is obvious and somewhat infectious. If you open both your heart and mind to practicing in this manner, it is likely that it will boost your mood and your spirit.  Even though I consider myself a more intermediate yoga student, I really enjoyed the sequence of postures in this practice; the routine left me feeling stretched and refreshed.  One final note, however:  Weintraub cautions that the breathwork is not appropriate for those with Bipolar disorder/mania and should also be avoided by those who are pregnant, menstruating, or suffering from high blood pressure or an inflammatory condition.",1262649600,11,3852,5.135782747603834
8170095,5,B000MMMWMU,Thanks for the quick delivery of this video. My children and I enjoy doing this yoga practice together. I was impressed with the quality of the yoga poses and the breathwork. Definately helps with the blues. Two thumbs up.,1238716800,,222,4.717948717948718
