7868956,4,6304383223,"I love all the early Saint films, but Louis Hayward came closest to Leslie Charteris's hero.  Hayward is caustic, witty, eccentric, and very dangerous as Simon Templar.  George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair were debonair as The Saint, but lacked the air of danger and bottled violence that Hayward conveyed.  ""The Saint in New York"" hews pretty closely to the fantastic novel, but is well-served by 1.3X playback.  The added pacing really makes this fine film hum.  George Sanders is entertaining in the fine ""The Saint Strikes Back"", but more in the vein of ""The Falcon"" -- a rle he was soon to play.  The picture quality of the first film is okay, but the second is clean and bright.  The VHS includes an enjoyable ten-minute video essay on the Saint films, as well as an introduction by Robert Osborne.",1434240000,,801,4.719424460431655

7868959,5,6304383223,"Sometimes longevity can obfuscate things. After watching THE SAINT IN NEW YORK, I am surely entertaining second thoughts. I had Roger Moore and George Sanders ranked as the two most superior performers to play Leslie Charteris's roguish adventurer, with Louis Hayward perched at a distant third. And I think that's still concrete. But I'm reforming my opinion of Hayward. His turn as Simon Templar in THE SAINT IN NEW YORK is an eye-opener. In fact, he's freakin' brilliant. And so, while he's still perched at that third slot, the distance to the top isn't as wide a span as originally presumed.

Unlike Moore and Sanders' extended runs, Louis Hayward's consisted of only two Saint pictures (the other would be 1953's THE SAINT'S RETURN a.k.a. THE SAINT'S GIRL FRIDAY). But, oh, brother, that first one! 1938's THE SAINT IN NEW YORK saw the haloed hero's first ever appearance on the silver screen. The movie was so popular it spawned a series of sequels. Only, Hayward was kicked to the curb and George Sanders tapped to replace him. Sucks for Hayward who today is regarded as a lower-tiered cinematic swashbuckler.

I love lists, and so does the Saint. When New York City is hard hit with a crippling crime wave, the beleaguered police department reaches out to that notorious, globe-trotting English adventurer Simon Templar. ""Gentlemen, what we need is a Robin Hood,"" remarks one official. Later, he tracks Templar down and pleads with him: ""My city suffers from a plague... I've been sent to ask your help."" Always relishing a new challenge, the Saint puts his fomenting a revolution in South America on pause and agrees to take on the Big Apple's most prominent racketeers. Under the table NYPD hands him a list with six names to check off, six underworld figures to dispose of. There goes the Saint, setting his halo on a jaunty angle, off to do an honest man's dirty work.

Who would've thunk it? Of all the Saint pictures, THE SAINT IN NEW YORK is unexpectedly my favorite. The pace hurtles like a wrecking ball. The action blisters. Maybe what sets Louis Hayward apart from Sanders and even Moore is that he doesn't lumber. When Hayward springs into action, he does so in the spriest of locomotion. TCM host Ben Mankiewicz has referred to George Sanders as ""the master of the sardonic wit and aloof sophistication."" I find Hayward, at least in this film, to be as erudite as Sanders, as worldly and debonair as Sanders, and as cool as the other side of the pillow. Maybe what truly sold me on Hayward was that dangerous glint in his eye and that rakish grin he frequently flashed, two things seemingly absent in Sanders' repertoire. The Saint flirts with the devil but sides with the angels. Louis Hayward perfectly embodies that. It would take a stunning dame like Kay Sutton's femme fatale to shove him off his even keel. His cop accomplice tries to warn him: ""Careful, my boy. Ladies are hard luck for men of action."" Simon Templar flashes him that cocky grin. But even a Saint can get stung.

THE SAINT IN NEW YORK was to have been Alfred Hitchcock's American debut as director, except that he opted to stay in England a few years longer. That's too bad. As terrific and engaging as this thriller was, how much more of a barnburner would this've been if only the Master of Suspense had had his fingerprints all over it?

Pardon me now as I treat THE SAINT STRIKES BACK almost like an afterthought. I'm copying and pasting what I'd already written about it from elsewhere:

- THE SAINT STRIKES BACK (1939)

This rather talky mystery debuts George Sanders as the Saint and co-stars Wendy Barrie in the first of her three appearances in this franchise (although she would play a different character each time). In San Francisco, on New Year's Eve, Simon Templar's busybody bump of curiosity is piqued when a murder takes place in a nightclub. Wendy Barrie plays the hard-boiled femme fatale Val Travers. Daughter of a disgraced policeman, Ms. Travers enlists her own crew of crooks to make it tough on them coppers. But scheming in the shadows lurks an elusive criminal mastermind, if only Templar can be bothered to take a break from his amorous flirtations with Ms. Travers. Based on Leslie Charteris' novel ANGELS OF DOOM. Co-starring Barry Fitzgerald and Neil Hamilton.",1352592000,2,4285,4.782432432432432
7868960,4,6304383223,"Hayward did New York. A nice double feature with ""Strikes Back"" starring George Sanders on the same tape. Robert Osborne even does an intro. for TCM. Mr. Hayward is pretty good & I admit he puts me in mind of James Bond more than Mr. Sanders. He's cruel & charming, kills with cool dispatch, yet he is still one of the good guys. The Law is ambivalent about The Saint/Simon Templar.  He is somewhat of a Robin Hood in that he steals from criminals, helps law enforcement but takes a cut for himself. In dispair New York City hires him (in secret) to rid  itself of criminal gangs that control the city & are corrupting the courts. He has a list of gang bosses & goes to work. Some die easy some not so. He falls in love with the moll(Kay Sutton) who saves his life (twice).
  Mr Sanders takes over in the second movie ""...Strikes Back"". A bit confused but the Saint gets involved when he assists Val's (Wendy Barry) escape from a New Year's Party where a murder has been committed. She is the daughter of a disgraced San Francisco cop. She seems to have a lot of axes to grind. But of course there is much more involved. See/buy the movie. You won't be disappointed. The best scenes are the berthing scenes on an overnight flight with the Saint & New York Inspector Fernack. The Saint again falls in love this time with Val: ""I love you but don't let's get sticky about it.""
Two for one. What a deal!",1170979200,4,1400,4.311787072243346
