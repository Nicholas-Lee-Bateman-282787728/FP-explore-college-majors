8357653,5,B0029A4URS,"A very good film. I bought it after viewing extracts of it on Youtube, not just for its historical value but for the insight it gives into the wonderfully robust and uninhibited lifestyle of the Cossacks. This includes such actions as performing Dzigitovka in the face of the enemy before going into battle, and fighting a well-trained and armored enemy without any armor and sometimes without even a shirt. An exciting window into a wonderfully courage-for-its-own-sake way of life, something sadly lacking in our politically correct and compromising West. Highly recommended for lovers of action.",1429056000,2,598,5.3052631578947365
8357654,5,B0029A4URS,The quality of this movie is superb - it looked like a whole new movie after watching a low resolution version for the past few years. And the movie itself is great!,1428019200,,165,4.1875
8357655,5,B0029A4URS,"I liked this new cut of the movie. The disc is working in systems of both Zone A and B, color is improved, and the sound plays beautifully on my new home theater system.",1376006400,,169,4.0
