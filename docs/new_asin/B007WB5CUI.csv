That omission is unacceptable to me.",1496707200,,132,5.333333333333333
8522454,5,B007WB5CUI,"Leave it to the Australian's to give us a wonderful, not to mention sexy, version of this Old Mozart Chestnut.  Great, inventive, scenery and performances.  Take my word for it, you won't be disappointed!",1435363200,,204,4.970588235294118
8522455,2,B007WB5CUI,I chose this disc based on the favorable reviews I read.  I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed on several levels.  The vocal performances were mediocre at best.  The set design didn't work very well and the camera work was amateurish and only highlighted the limitations of the performers.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone familiar with the opera or looking for quality vocal performances.,1364083200,9,402,4.955223880597015
8522456,4,B007WB5CUI,"Teddy Tahu Rhodes is the reason for getting this Don Giovanni-he sings well, acts well and looks like a man who could successfully seduce women. He was very good in the MET's ""Peter Grimes""(but that was a cast in which almost everyone was outstandingly good)and he matches that performance here.",1361145600,2,295,4.92
8522457,5,B007WB5CUI,"Don Giovanni is one of those operas I have almost every video performance issued, simply because I haven't found any that I truly like. The search stops with this blu-ray. The reason is Teddy Tahu Rhodes. I have no interest in this production or in any of the singers except for him. What is it about him? Does he sing the Don better than anyone else? I don't know, I can't even analyze it in musical terms. It's that voice (it's not just his good looks). If viagra could sing it would sound like him. Opera Australia have a star here and a gold mine they would be foolish not to make full use of. I am buying anything with the name Teddy Tahu Rhodes on it. I got the Opera Australia Marriage of Figaro only for him and did not regret it. They should hurry up and create a production of Boito's Mefistofele especially for him - he is a godsent devil.",1359763200,6,850,4.220858895705521
8522458,5,B007WB5CUI,"It is one of the greatest operas, the production is fine, the singers and orchestra perform wonderfully. With all the crazy productions around, this one is well worth the price",1357084800,2,176,4.9
8522459,4,B007WB5CUI,"This is not going to be a easy review.  This new DON GIOVANNI has many real strengths and weaknesses and often in the same performer.  This is going to take some very detailed analyse.  The Blu-ray production also has some issues and inconsistencies.
1) The sound is a mixed bag.  Orchestra sound and clarity is excellent; however, vocal sound changes from character to character and starts muddled and improves as the First Act progresses.  The Don himself has the worst sound field i.e. cavernous and many times without focus.  Some of the problem is his own vocal production.  More on this later.
2) The sound from the pit is excellent with Mark Wigglesworth conducting a magnificent account of this wonderful score.  Tempi and balances are ideal; and all rhythmns are ideally articulated.  Try the overture's opening chords; many conductors don't get this right... Weighty yet distinct and clear.  Wigglesworth is a great Mozartian!
3) Opera Australia seems to take the rehearsal time necessary to really let every singer develop a credible dramatic personae.  Every gesture and expression appear natural and motivated by the psychology of the moment.  They live the moment and recieve detailed and excellent direction from Goran Jarvefelt.
4) The unit set works well.  Costumes & lighting are colorful.  In fact, vibrant colors, fabrics and lighting seem to a trait of this company and its four new releases.
5) The singers are generally fine to excellent in this production; just not quite World Class.  But, and this is a BIG BUT they all can truly act and move.  All use their bodies naturally and when needed dramatically.
6) Now for the individual voices and characterizations:
7) The Don - Teddy Tahu Rhodes is a stage directors dream come true.  He can handle anything the character or director requires of him.  He is truly a sexy Don and to use a box office term - A HUNK! He is the greatest acting Don Giovanni I have ever experienced.  He is a good musician; however, he has some vocal flaws.  His is a very dark gutteral bass with a distorting growl in his lowest octave.  He also has some bad vocal habits.  His tongue goes back in his throat and produces a throaty sound.  He also aplies a lot of throat pressure and tongue tension.  This makes his lower voice gravely and in the great Mozart ensembles and Finales this causes clarity and precision tuning problems in the ensembles. Certain vowels are improperly sung.  Ah is uh, oh is ouuh and eh sounds like the french neutral e.
8) Leporello -Conal Coad is fine in the ""Fernando Corena"" mold.
9) Don Octavio and the Comendatore are also very good.  Henry Choo as Octavio does some lovely lyric work at times.
10) Rachelle Durkin does a fine Donna Anna her ""Or sai chi L'onore"" is dramatic and she has little problem with ""Non mi dir.""  A fine Donna Anna not a great one.  The best Donna Annas according to Elisabeth Schwarzkoff were Leontyne Price and Elizabeth Grummer.  Having heard Price live at the MET in this role I have to agree. Grummer on film and recordings is just as great. Durkin does well in this illustrious company.
11) Jacqueline Dark is everything you could ask for as Donna Elvira.  She is always dramatically alive and is in excellent voice.  She never spreads, pushes or distorts her fine sound; yet, she doesn't hold back or shirk any drama.  A great vocal and dramatic portrayal of this Avenging Angel.
12) Masetto & Zerlina are all one could wish for.  Both Andrew Jones and Taryn Fiebig make the young married couple a joy to see and hear.
13) Don Giovanni is in my humble opinion one of those perfect operas that I woundn't change an iota.  I have also seen three performances live that were miracles of perfection. A truly magical night of theater.  This one comes very close in many areas; but, just misses the Rosette.  I will watch it again and even very much appreciate Teddy Tahu Rhodes with his strenghts and weaknesses.  I just wish the sound were better and consistent.",1351814400,21,3976,4.7101449275362315

The singing is superlative and the acting remarkable. In particular, Teddy Tahu Rhodes shines in the title role. In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that he not only looks and acts and sings the part superlatively - oozing testosterone and strutting around with a lascivious gleam in his eye - he actually manages to INCARNATE Don Giovanni in a way that the Jury felt was virtually unmatched.

Here are two quotes from the Jury members' comments:

""One of the most exciting productions of this opera I have ever seen. The basic, conventional staging set off the outstanding stage presence and acting skills of the cast. Zerlina, Donna Anna and of course, the Don himself, were all particularly impressive singers. This was a total theatrical experience!!!""

""Really impressive! Loved it all, especially the final scenes and the very fine singing throughout. Despite the humour which came through at times, I was very much aware of an underlying darkness pervading everything. A fantastic opera - and a fantastic production!""

Since all but 1 of the 15 Jury members had seen other productions of this opera before, we asked them an additional question: ""Is Teddy Tahu Rhodes the best Don Giovanni you have ever seen?"" 3 said ""No"" (one of them adding ""But he is very good"" ) and 11 saying ""Yes"" (with one - who had seen 5 other productions - adding ""Best by far"").

That is a decisive 78% !!! who think Teddy Tahu Rhodes is the best Don Giovanni they have ever seen in their opera-going lives!
