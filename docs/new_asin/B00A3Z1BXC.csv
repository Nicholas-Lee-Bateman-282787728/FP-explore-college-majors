5381480,3,B00A3Z1BXC,Thought it was going to be various clips but it was all black and white from an Australia Concert. Worth one look.,1359590400,3,114,4.2272727272727275
5381481,4,B00A3Z1BXC,"While bits and pieces of this concert can be found on Youtube (usually with bad video quality), this DVD manages to present the concert in its (almost) totality (the beginning seconds of the concert are cut off) in b&w images that are comparable to a good VHS tape--in other words, quite acceptable. Its audio quality is pretty good though. Since the concert was originally recorded for TV broadcast, no doubt that is the source of this DVD.

This DVD is clearly not an offical release, but given the rarity of its content, it should be a must buy for all Carpenters fans. For fans of KC, you'll be treated to her extensive drum playing--something she did less and less often in later concerts. Another thing to note is that many of the songs are rendered with substantial variation from their recorded versions. Intentional or not (or perhaps unavoidably), this is what makes live performances so interesting for fans to collect--if only for historical purposes.",1359504000,8,963,4.871951219512195
5381482,5,B00A3Z1BXC,I just can't put into words how much I love this disc.  DVDs of concerts and TV specials have been non-existent for years due to Richard's aversion to them. I've always maintained that since they were unable to record an album in 1974 they should have released Live in Japan and culled either Help or Jambiliya for a single. At least we are starting to get bootleg discs here and there. Anyone who considers themselves a Carpenters fan MUST add this to their  collection. My only regret is that it has no beginning or end but that's quibbling. Do yourself a favor and get your own copy while they are available.,1359417600,7,611,4.495495495495495
5381483,5,B00A3Z1BXC,"This video is from one of the concerts performed at the Chevron hotel in Sydney, Australia during the Australian tour of May 1972. It was filmed for the television, black and white at the time in Australia (they didn't have full color TV until 1975). Karen looks pretty and sings as beautifully as ever and Richard's arrangements on the Bacharach's Medley are superb. The quality of sound and video is not perfect, but is good considering the age. This is a must have if you are a fan of the Carpenters. Highly recommended!!.",1359072000,16,525,4.655913978494624
5381484,4,B00A3Z1BXC,"I was looking forward to this DVD of ""rarities"" because ""Yesterday Once More"" was listed on the title page, along with ""Sometimes.""  Neither song appears on this ""rarities"" DVD.  All songs are from their concent in Aussie in 1972.  Nothing else.  There seems to be confusion about whether it is 1971 and/or 1972.  It is just 1972.  During the introductions, Richard says Karen is 22.  She was born in 1950.  That would make it 1972.  Also Karen says they have been doing this for ""a little over two years"" now.  That would make it 1972.  I am glad to have this DVD in my collection but I am disappointed that is it in black and white not color (man, it was 1972!) and that ""Yesterday Once More"" and ""Sometimes"" were not on the DVD.  Why did XXL Media Entertainment place those two songs on the cover when neither appear on the DVD?",1359072000,30,831,4.394736842105263

5381487,5,B00A3Z1BXC,"I don't care that the sound is flat, the black and white cinematography is flatter..and that all the back up dudes are clones of Richard: same height, same body frame, same suit, same freaking haircut...I am not kidding.

But to cut to the proverbial chase: here we have great A & R and that under-appreciated and under-discussed genius, Karen Carpenter. She and her Brother managed to inject light jazz into pop and create Top 100 and Small Club  appeal. An *original* talent who proves you can be a sex symbol in a dress found in the wardrobe department for the pilot of Little House on the Prairie; or whatever she wears on these early '70s TV performances.

A pleasure as nostalgia...and to value against the electro.-mechanical drivel with which we get blasted, today.

Just think of KC's ""so many roads to choose"" and get the chills all over again. Better yet, dig it on this cool DVD!",1374969600,,891,4.656050955414012
5381488,5,B00A3Z1BXC,i had watch the dvd over and over this is a great dvd if anyone likes the carpenters this one is for you,1371427200,3,104,3.5652173913043477
5381489,1,B00A3Z1BXC,"I was looking forward to, see this video. But, all I found was a group of people telling about the carpenters. I like to sent it back and get my money back.",1366156800,2,156,3.90625
5381490,5,B00A3Z1BXC,"If you want to have something to remember Karen and Richard Carpenter by . This is a must to have I couldn't belive they had Frank Pooler conducting on stage with them in this concert. As I understand Frank Pooler wrote Merry Christmas Darling back in 1946. Richard and Frank was friends and re compose the song for Karen to sing back in 1970 . If you ever have heard this song it was one of the best Christmas Songs I thought they ever had done. The song is not in the concert. But Frank Pooler was.
I know it is in black and white . But I really enjoyed it. A must to have if you Love the Carpenters. Hope this will help you . Patrick T Lannon",1364947200,3,645,4.007751937984496
5381491,5,B00A3Z1BXC,"This DVD is a rare look at Richard & Karen Carpenter in Concert along with some of the things that made their music so special from 1969 until Karen's untimely death on February 4, 1983. (30 years ago) the intrest in the music that these 2 very talented siblings released is still just as popular today as is was when CARPENTERS were in the 1970's.

If you never got to see Richard & Karen Carpenter  perform live.  Sit back and enjoy.",1363996800,3,435,4.345679012345679
5381492,5,B00A3Z1BXC,"This is another DVD that appears to be a bootleg of the Carpenters live in concert. It is certainly worth owning if you like the Carpenters. Karen was only 22 when this was made and she was at the top of her game at this time in her life. I find it amazing that she never took one vocal lesson. That being said, I would still like to think that Richard Carpenter has films of the Carpenters in concert somewhere. I would like to see a concert of the Carpenters released by Richard Carpenter rather  than by  some bootleggers.",1361491200,4,525,4.292929292929293
5381493,5,B00A3Z1BXC,"Have been looking for this DVD for a long time.  It is actually taken from the B&W concert for TV they had made back in Australia.  All the songs on it are classics and there are great shots of Karen playing on the drums.  Her voice is unlike a lot of singers, sweet and hitting some low notes in some places we find it hard to control our voices in and she and her brother brings perfection to their harmonies.  If anyone is looking for The Carpenters live in Australia, this is the one you're looking for and like the title says it's very rare.  Sure miss some of these performances of the 70s and last of all there will never be another Karen Carpenter.  Pity we have so little treasures left off this gem.",1360972800,3,709,4.214814814814815
5381494,4,B00A3Z1BXC,I enjoy the Carpenters always I can't get enought of Karen her lost was a major hit to the music world. The only thing I didn't like is that the sound has been messed with so it sounds a little strange at times.,1360454400,4,211,3.9302325581395348
5381495,3,B00A3Z1BXC,i am still baffled as to why their tv specials are not out on dvd. i have heard its about the permits etc but the specials were in the 70's so don't they become safe to see after 30-40yrs? i mean their specials from anne murray to capt n tennille to tony orlando with all their music guest on them yet we cant get more than some 45 min concert? i gave it 3 stars as its something with karen in it but these were mostly early songs with a few hits sprinkled in not much else. i mean we the ppl that loved the Carpenters r slowly becoming senior citizens and passing away. so if you want the ppl that loved the Carpenters start releasing the specials already!! todays 'kids' don't know anything bout the Carpenters. i have college friends that say 'who were the carpenters again?' they don't have a clue as radio stations don't play them unless u go to a sirus radio and pick on the 70's easy listening channel.,1359763200,3,909,4.2298850574712645
5381496,5,B00A3Z1BXC,"I saw Karen and Richard in Norfolk, VA on this tour.  Such a tremendous feeling to be taken back to a childhood dream.  My parents, both Carpenter fans, took me to see this show.  While the quality of this is somewhat sketchy, I enjoyed every moment.  A must for Carpenter fans.",1359676800,6,278,4.392156862745098

8546601,3,B00A3Z1BXC,"A few disappointments, the video quality was not very good, and the cover listed the songs Sometimes and Yesterday once more which were not on the DVD.
However the audio was good and the show brought back many menories",1456963200,,218,4.615384615384615

8546604,3,B00A3Z1BXC,A collector must have. But if you are not just wait till the price goes down.,1420848000,,77,3.875
8546605,4,B00A3Z1BXC,this dvd is almost perfect- its just how the opening just cuts in and the ending cuts out and the fairly low quality of the audio and picture lets it down! However if you are a carpenters fan i think its definately worth a buy to add to a collection.,1389398400,,250,4.02
8546606,3,B00A3Z1BXC,"Tape was good to watch, only exception was that it was in black and white. I did like the songs but the sound seemed poor a bit.",1381363200,,128,3.7777777777777777
8546607,4,B00A3Z1BXC,"This wasn't quite what I thought it would be. It is a live show by the Carpenters in the beginning of their career. Great performance in Australia. Filmed in B&W however and the sound quality is lacking. Sounds Mono. Otherwise it was ok. If you are a diehard Carpenters fan, you'll want this, otherwise look to their other videos.",1380672000,,330,4.610169491525424
