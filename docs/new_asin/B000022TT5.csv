1249729,3,B000022TT5,"While I am a bit young to be a total 70's guy I do have a love of films made in that era. And not just the French Connection,Jaws. Star Wars epic films either. I have in my own collection a slew of low budget made in the 70's films meant for the Drive-In movies . So I was attracted to 1974's The Centerfold Girls which was a low budget precursor to the 80's slasher films. The cast is very good with a wide variety of second tier and recognizable names .What hurts the film is the general nastiness it displays towards it's female characters. None of the victims are portrayed in a a positive light thus almost making it seem that the producer and director wanted the audience to empathize with the killer Clement Dunne played very creepily by veteran actor Andrew Prine. Mr. Prine who has a wide spanning career arc from older films like The Miracle Worker to what seems like every tv series made in the 70's and 80's. He plays Dunne as a self righteous but self loathing individual. The film is actually 3 stories in one starting with the first story with young nurse Jackie played by veteran tv actress/soap opera icon Jamie Lyn Bauer. The premise of the film is Dunne is obsessed over young nubile females showing skin in nudie calendars .He starts with stalking,harassing and trailing Jackie who is on her way to interview for a camp nurses job. Along the way Jackie picks up young hitchhiker Linda(Janet Wood) who claims to be stranded by her boyfriend. Ms. Wood is notable for also appearing in Russ Myers skinamatic classic Up .It turns out to be a set up and Linda has a commune group following along and they end up forcing their way into Jackie's Aunt's house. Dunne is also lurking around waiting for a chance at Jackie as well. This story here I found downright nasty as Jackie is subjected to assault and humiliation from Linda's boyfriend and crew. She look for help from the people who run the camp and the caretaker played by Aldo Ray tries to rape her. Then to add insult to injury Dunne finally shows up and kills her(spoiler alert) The second story is a modeling shoot set up on a secluded island. Dunne has his sights set upon Charley played by the lovely Jennifer Ashley. Genre fans will likely recall her as one of the Pom-Pom Girls as well as being in such fare as Chained Heat,Phantom of the Paradise and Guyana Cult of the Damned. The shoot is being overseen by strict and possibly lesbian mistress Melissa played by the awesome Francine York. Ms. York has a career as long as Prine's and was recently in the tv series Hot in Cleveland. She also was in the b movie classic The Doll Squad and old tv series like Love American Style and Adam-12. This story is not as nasty as the first and is saved by the good acting jobs from York,Ashley,Prine and Ray Dalton who plays Melissa's assistant that she hates and abuses at every turn. Dunne makes his way unto the island and begins his stalk and kill routine again. The last and best story is the one starring the beautiful Tiffany Bolling as Vera a stewardess (this was the 70's you know)who models also .Dunne has seen Vera's shot for the same calendar that the other 2 girls were in and targets her for his next (last?) victim. Vera is the only model that gets to put up a fight and even she gets raped by 2 horny sailors who pick her up when her car breaks down. Not sure why they felt compelled to have Vera be assaulted prior to her encounter with Dunne much like Jackie was in the 1st story? Anyhow the grand finale shot in a recently charred and burnt forest in scenic California is a sight to behold. The atmosphere is almost alien like. I liked Tiffany Bolling from her other films Bonnie's Kids and The Candy Snatchers and she does a fine job here as well. Since the source material is about nude models you can imagine that there's a lot of female nudity in this film as well some gratuitous some not. Plus young women in the 70's tended to have natural bodies ( i.e. no boob jobs) which I much prefer to the material out there nowadays. I recommend this film to those who like decent acting in low budget films as well as horror film fans and 70's exploitation fans.",1351987200,4,4151,4.399219765929779
1249730,5,B000022TT5,"Here is another Tiffany Bolling movie. I watched this movie back to back with Bonnies Kids. Centerfold Girls was by far the better in every respect. This movie had way more T & A, way better plot, really kept your attention, not boring at all. This movie was made in 1974 and Bonnies Kids in 1972. Both have alot of older classic cars ( not the restored kind), period clothing and styles, which always bring back memories. Tiffany has good looks and a very good body, but her acting was never top notch. She shows more of her body in Centerfold than in Bonnie, and she was only on screen for around 30 minutes in Centerfold. Anyway, this movie was quick paced and kept you guessing what would happen next. There is violence, some blood, no gore and a rape, and two attempted rapes. Lots of T&A, almost too much to count. There are three different story lines which tend to end abruptly when our religious fanatic (serial killer) finally comes face to face with the centerfolds. Good stuff, especially for 1974. Very enjoyable.",1330992000,5,1026,4.581521739130435
1249731,5,B000022TT5,A GREAT MOVIE WITH AN INTERESTING STORY. THE KILLER IS AWESOME AND THE WOMEN ARE STUNNING WHAT MORE CAN YOU WANT WITH SOMETHING BEING AN ORIGINAL PIECE OF LET'S SAY HORROR. IT JUST MAKES IT SOUND BETTER HORROR. LOL! WHAT A GREAT MOVIE TO HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION. MUST HAVE! OH! THE WOMEN MIGHT WANNA RE THINK ABOUT DOING CENTERFOLD BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO THEY MIGHT UPSET! COOL MOVIE!,1281657600,3,388,4.557142857142857
1249732,5,B000022TT5,"The Centerfold girls was very progressive for 1974.
the blood letting was plenty and the effects good for such an early entry in the slasher pool.
It had three different stories all with the same killer played to perfection by Andrew Prine.
Each ""main"" victim had a separate tale. One story in particular was very reminiscent of The Last House on The Left,where a bunch of hippies break into one woman's. house terrorize and rape her even before she encounters the killer.

The last story with Tiffany Bolling was great as well ""It was the last story for a reason""..I know it's only a movie but almost every man in the movie was portrayed as a slimy vile creature that just wanted to rape women. I suppose since all the women were naked and victimized they wanted to defame the men as well.

But it's a great retro slasher,very deserving of any slasher fan's collection and one you will want to watch mre than once!",1247184000,6,915,4.539393939393939
1249733,4,B000022TT5,"I'm not sure if I would've been as enthusiastic about this movie if I hadn't just sat through another lame recent ""torture porn"" movie first.  Sure I would've been appreciative of the drive-in flashback feel to THE CENTERFOLD GIRLS but at least this movie delivered what I want from a cheap slasher-type movie: lots of hot chicks who frolic, take showers, sleep in the buff, and have difficulty keeping clothes on.

I bought this DVD because I'm a fan of Tiffany Bolling.  The movie is divided into three stories that all share hot chicks and a demented killer who has to murder centerfolds.  Tiffany is in the third story but all of the girls are beautiful.

This new DVD includes a brief documentary that chats with a few of the actors (not Tiffany though).

With A-list filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino making movies that shamelessly rip off every aspect of the ""grindhouse"" movie experience, it's better to have access to the real thing.",1241654400,17,942,4.783950617283951
1249734,4,B000022TT5,"This is the sort of film that has you wishing you could time-travel back to the heyday of the drive-ins to catch it in its ideal environment. Scary, tight lipped Andrew Prine plays a murderous psychopath working his way through a bunch of pretty girls, whose only 'sin' is to have modelled for a sexy calendar. Well-shot, well-acted, but it's the doom-laden mood and oddball structure that makes Centerfold Girls stand out - three stories about three girls linked only through their encounters with the killer, sort of like Pulp Fiction without the self-congratulation. Should be sought after by anyone who likes the darker, stranger drive-in fare of the 70s.",1240272000,13,659,5.0
1249735,3,B000022TT5,"Greetings from Tromaville!
I got this film free as a gift from Troma. It involves a right-wing religeous nut who kills girls in his centerfold calendar because his finds pornography deplorable.
Although this film goes off track on several occations, it is still very enjoyable and worth the cost of purchase. It also contains the trailor for one of Troma's best films: ""Fatty Drives The Bus"".",992908800,5,392,4.954545454545454

7915344,5,B000022TT5,"As far as exploitation movies go, this one is a blast! It's packed full of nudity, degenerate characters and grotesque situations. The violence is a little on the light side, but the plot doesn't require tons of gore to be engaging. A definite gem of the genre.",1517875200,2,261,4.574468085106383
7915345,1,B000022TT5,Extremely dull early 1970's exploitation film about a psycho who is killing women who appear as centerfolds in a magazine.  The Centerfold Girls has a decent amount of nudity but that isn't enough to make up for the complete lack of suspense or interest in whether any of the intended victims actually survives.  This one is beyond tedious and is directed with all the style of a porn film.  The characters are perpetually stupid.  The script is garbage.  The movie is the kind of junk that would play on the bottom of a double or triple feature at grindhouse theaters and that you would forget about ten minutes after you left the theater.  Not all grindhouse films are forgotten classics.  Most are actually garbage like The Centerfold Girls that definitely aren't worth dredging up for special edition DVDs and Blu-rays.,1488758400,,823,4.835714285714285

7915349,3,B000022TT5,"An okay thriller with a fair amount of female nudity, but the plot could have been better.

As a veteran, I resented that two Navy men were portrayed as thuggish rapists. This is a stereotype which was unfortunately prevalent in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, when the movie was made, and was quite hurtful to veterans.",1406160000,2,322,4.649122807017544
7915350,5,B000022TT5,"This is one of the best suspense films from the 70s. The storyline and drama kept me drawn into the story for the most part. The pace of the movie stalls for a short time, but picks back up and any of slowness of film is made up with the last fifteen minutes of the movie. Tiffany Bolling is highly entertaining, as well as the centerfold girls murderer. The character himself gives us a glimpse into the demented thought process of a truly insane and unstable person. Check out The Centerfold Girls.",1405296000,,500,4.445652173913044
