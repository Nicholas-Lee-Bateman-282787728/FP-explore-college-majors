8268460,1,B00186DEZI,"I thought it would be ok but I was wrong, it had way to many bong clips and just clips in general.
it is not worth the money that I spent on it.
To much rap music. rap just sucks.
It was so BORING that I almost fell asleep.",1293580800,,223,3.5714285714285716
8268461,1,B00186DEZI,"I love tits and street fighting as much as the next guy but this just fell short. It's just an hour of 20 second clips. The girls were hot but over all the movie just wasn't worth watching. Ninety percent of the movie doesn't even have sound, it's just rap music playing threw the whole damn movie. The worst part was that the director tried to get artsy with it by using fish eye lenses, black and white scenes, slow motion, and rewind. It's hard to mess up something so simple but the managed to do it. They actually made tits and fighting unwatchable.",1290211200,11,554,4.336538461538462

8268463,1,B00186DEZI,"This DVD is horrible.. do not buy. The footage rewinds itself and the fights should not be called fights, it is garbage. I sent mine back to the seller. DO NOT BUY or waste your money at all on this product.",1263772800,9,207,4.073170731707317
8268464,3,B00186DEZI,I was stationed in Iraq and I needed something funny to watch to past the time.  There are some good fights and a really good girl fight in the end.  The only problem is that there is too much of bong hit footage and that gets real boring fast.,1245974400,,244,3.9591836734693877
8268465,5,B00186DEZI,"I'm currently deployed to afghanistan.... since i've been deployed here i have gotten my friend's really into almost illegal, they all love it. I need to get myself another copy since mine was misplaced by a buddy.... i grew up where a lot of it was filmed all my life... most of the peeps in almost illegal i know from back in the day and most of those fights that were taped, i saw first hand and know most of the people who fought.....
