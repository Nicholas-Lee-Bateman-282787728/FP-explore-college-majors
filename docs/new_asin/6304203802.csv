It was about me and my first love. Wow, it's nothing like the reality. The reality was far more severe and sad.",1393718400,,259,4.2
7865454,5,6304203802,Saw this movie years ago. Excellent movie. I cried. I thought it made you think about the human condition. Tear jerker.,1359158400,,119,4.714285714285714
7865455,5,6304203802,"Although there is a lot of profanity in this movie, without such language the morale and moral value of the movie would have been lost. I believe that US Senator Bob Kerry (now retired), a Medal of Honor Winner and Vietnam combat veteran would agree with me, when I say that this movie should be required watching as part of social studies in high school. Sissy Spacek puts on another powerful performance that is certain to bring tears to anyone who watches it. I find it hard to believe that this movie is NOT listed in her filmography, and also did NOT win even a mention in any film awards that I know of. It is also not available in US DVD format, but the VHS can be legally converted by VHS-to-DVD services in one copy for personal use only, which is what I did with great HD results.",1239580800,3,790,4.308724832214765
7865456,5,6304203802,"This movie needs greater recognition, so after just seeing it on TV I'll add to the positive commentary. The screenplay and especially the performances by Spacek, Howard and Straithorn are gripping and real. Good words, very good acting, and minimal but effective special effects make real the effect of an ugly war on the two men portrayed here.",1230854400,3,346,4.982758620689655
7865457,4,6304203802,"This film was a Showtime special based on actual events.  Sissy Spacek's role as Pamela, the former girlfriend of death row inmate Russell(David Strathairn) shows her usual depth with a superior script by Doug Magee.  Emotion and thought provoking dialogue ensues between the 2, as Arliss Howard as Keith, her husband has the weaker less believable role.  Both he and Russell suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome from Vietnam and the audio only flashbacks point to a low budget.  The real brilliance of the film is the relationship between Pam and Russell as he gets closer to the execution date.
  In the background is the injustice system South Carolina style and the covert commentary against the death penalty.  You end up empathizing with Russell up to an emotional end that will stay with you.  In contrast to Dead Man Walking where the dialogue spells out everything with overdirectness, this one implies everything assuming the intelligence of the viewer.",991094400,9,969,5.0886075949367084
