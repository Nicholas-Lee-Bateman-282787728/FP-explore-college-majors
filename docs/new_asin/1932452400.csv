Because everyone needs to eat food, it's not like one can stop cold turkey.  It's not like there is any place you can go an avoid food - one must some how - just get right with it. . . and probably one dvd won't solve everything, but it is a good start.

This yoga practice centers on the core, which both yogic-ly and physiologically is where the enteric nervous system is housed.  Just doing the exercises will force a practitioner to focus subconsciously.  One will get even more out of the practice by consciously practicing.  Experience how your core feels doing this, be sensational not dramatic.

The holds are long - one has plenty of time to meditate.  If you are a person who suffers from eating disorders you may feel frustrated, and that would be normal.  Learning the counterintuitive skill of sitting with a mild amount of discomfort in a controlled environment is key to healing any form of addictive behavior.  If you are a health professional, you will also find the discussions and practice interesting.

If you are new to yoga, I suggest that in addition to the dvd, when you feel ready, you venture out to find a live teacher.  If there are classes available in your area to people in 12 step groups or with eating disorders or PTSD those might feel safer than a generic beginner class.  I rarely suggest starting yoga with a Dvd, but in the case, if being around others is untenable. I do recommend starting alone.",1410825600,,1599,4.604240282685512
