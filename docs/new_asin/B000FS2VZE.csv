8125817,5,B000FS2VZE,"Basilisk takes place in 1614 during the Tokugawa Shogunate era. Two ninja clans are at war with each other competing to win the favor of the regime for the next 1000 years. Each clan has to choose 10 members. Whichever clan kills the 10 members of their rival wins.

There are a lot of awesome things to say about this anime. The animation, the music, and the story line are all great. Almost all , of the characters are too. There are a few ninjas I didn't like though. One guy kills you with his hair, one guy is a quadriplegic that kills you with a knife that he holds with his tongue, and one dude turns into goo when he touches salt. Most of the other ninjas are awesome though. The bad guy is really a heartless bastard. It makes it very interesting when you have a bad guy that is way evil. The characters really keep you interested and the carnage never lets up.

I really think anyone that likes anime would get a kick outta this one. If you like it there's a live action movie called Shinobi. It's the same story line with a few less characters. It's incredible as well.

Definitely give Basilisk a look see.",1354060800,,1118,4.289099526066351
8125818,5,B000FS2VZE,"I not only enjoyed the story-telling and animation, but also the soundtrack, so I bought the entire series. I will use some of the series, editing out the rough sex, to augment my Ninja camp this summer for 5th through 9th graders.",1352160000,,231,4.523809523809524
8125819,5,B000FS2VZE,The whole Basilisk series is worth the money. I haven't found decent anime in a good while--but this is most excellent.,1266537600,,119,4.714285714285714
8125820,5,B000FS2VZE,"This is a nice anime that is not ashamed of old school anime heritage 'lots of monsters and buckets of blood' .
The dvd is with high product value 'crisp and clean picture on screen'  .
price needs to go down.",1252800000,,209,4.097560975609756
8125821,5,B000FS2VZE,"In a lot of anime, once we get past the exciting intro done by the first few episodes we usually have a boring second volume that slows things down- not so with Basilisk! In volume 2: The Spoils of War we jump right back into the action with a plot that just keeps on moving at incredible speed.

Volume 2 hits us with four more action packed episodes where we finally get to see inside the Kouga clan and meet more of their ninjas. This adds an extra layer as it really hits you how you can't pick a side. After watching the first four episodes (more like ep 2-4) I had 'picked a side' since I liked the characters of the Iga clan so much, but now, well let's just say, the Kouga clan has characters you'll end up rooting for too (including a Akeginu look-a-like).

If you enjoyed volume 1, then you won't be disappointed with this one, you'll be left wishing volume 3 would get here faster!",1162425600,2,892,4.241176470588235
8125822,5,B000FS2VZE,This is seriously one of the best anime series out. I was drawn in immediately. The ruthlessness of the characters on each side will astound you. You will be torn between which family that you are supposed to root for.  The genius of this is that the series does a good job of Not favoring either side throughout each episode. Just when you feel comfortable to pick a side you are immediately thrown a curve ball. I watched the whole series in one day it draws you in that much. A MUST OWN PEOPLE I AM NOT KIDDING.,1162080000,6,514,4.244897959183674
