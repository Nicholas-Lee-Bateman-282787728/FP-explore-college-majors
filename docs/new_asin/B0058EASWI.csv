8461443,5,B0058EASWI,"If I came into a financial windfall tomorrow, my first indulgent purchase would be a sleek scissor-doored custom-made Lamborghini, and to anyone who also loves or admires this car, this is a priceless episode of National Geographic's Ultimate Factories to own.  This is the only high end superstar automobile that is lovingly and uniquely constructed almost entirely by hand, and this DVD walks you through each factory worker's pride-filled job with in-depth description and explanation.  The Lamborghini has just one large factory in a small northern Italian town called Sant'Agata near Bologna, and this program highlights the assembly of just one variety, the lighter weight carbon Murcielago SV priced at $450,000.  Each car is custom built to the buyer's specifications, in any color desired, with beautiful leather and/or lightweight synthetic interiors that are painstakingly hand-sewn by talented upholsterers.  The show unfolds with one assembly stage after another, for example the paint job is done by one worker who gives it several coats of special spray paint, and you go from beginning to end totally engrossed in the amazing
journey of making this wonderful car.  There is a history flashback at the program's beginning describing the creator's rivalry with Enzo Ferrari, explanation of the car's changing style over the years, and toward the end it is amusing to see how the test drivers must take this super-charged, speedy car on the road through their small hilly Italian town, and how they are frequently ticketed for speeding, which comes as no surprise.  This is a great documentary DVD to own or give as a gift to a high end car enthusiast.",1337990400,,1665,5.171003717472119
