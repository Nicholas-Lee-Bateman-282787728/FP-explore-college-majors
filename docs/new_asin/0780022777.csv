7789367,5,0780022777,"I have visited Westminster Abbey, several times and I only wish these tapes had been in existence before I did so. This is the BEST tour you will ever have of this wonderous old Abbey.  So many  areas explored and much  information presented far better than any tour guide could do. As a  visitor, there was much I did not know nor see.  If you love British  history as I do, this set is a must. When seen on TV several years ago, I  knew I must have it.  Now, at last, I have found it!  Should you plan a  trip to London, and the Abbey, see this first!",958176000,3,553,3.9908256880733943
