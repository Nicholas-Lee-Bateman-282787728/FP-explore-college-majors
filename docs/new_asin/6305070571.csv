7881637,3,6305070571,"""Sudden Impact"" was put out about the same time that the media was all abuzz with the two dueling disaster films, ""Armegeddon"" and ""Deep Impact"".
The 55 minute documentary competently explains meteors and present-day theories about these visitors from space. Probably the highlight would have to be a fellow who describes himself as ""The Meteor Man"", who owns a prized private collection of meteors. He clearly lays out, and it is repeated in the narration, what tools you need to find, and how to recognize, a meteor fragment.
I do have to say that I felt the documentary was a bit on the thin side, sort of like the semi-watered down average offering on the Discovery Channel. The computer animantion and graphics are a bit primative, which doesn't help much.
However, this would be an excellent tape to get for the kid in your family who may have an interest in space. Clearly rated G, so no worries there, and they'll like the goofy Meteor Man (think of a meteor-hunting guy who looks like Kenny G).",1032998400,,1003,4.704545454545454
