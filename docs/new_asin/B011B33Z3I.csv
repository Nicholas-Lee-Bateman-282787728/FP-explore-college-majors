7331932,1,B011B33Z3I,"Not scary, but no whiff of humor, so the hammy acting is just bad. Character motivations completely unbelievable. Why does the call girl fall for the dork? Uh, no reason - the script says she does. The misogyny and racist caricature are somewhat true to the source material, i guess, but many modern Lovecraftian takes ditch them, this embraces them. Thought this might be campy and/or trashy fun, but a thoroughgoing stinker. On the bright side: some decent old school style punk in the soundtrack; the cultists' outfits were kinda cool.",1446336000,2,538,4.923076923076923

If you go into it knowing what it is, you're going to love it, and what it is is a throwback to cheesy horror movies of the 70's with a Lovecraft twist. No CGI, classic special effects that, beside modern large-budget movies, will make you chuckle, and small references to Lovecraft every few minutes. If you go into it expecting an intense modern thriller with the latest in special effects, you'll be disappointed because this is completely not that.",1445299200,6,498,4.670454545454546

7331939,4,B011B33Z3I,"FANGORIA REVIEW by Michael Gingold

You could make a drinking game out of all the in-jokes and throwaway references to H.P. Lovecraft in CALL GIRL OF CTHULHU, but this is one campy horror flick that doesnt require being drunk to enjoy it.

The most ambitious feature yet from up-and-coming Baltimore filmmaker Chris LaMartina (who also wrote and produced with Jimmy George, and did the score as well), CALL GIRL OF CTHULHU finds all sorts of sexy, splattery, silly ways to riff on the eldritch author while still bearing an underlying reverence. Its an unabashed, full-throttle exploitation film, yet one that its easy to imagine Lovecraft himself getting a good giggle out of.

LaMartina frames the film with a police interrogation, which isn't really necessary as the story proper wastes little time in getting down to business. In a world where even the Chinese restaurants and air fresheners have names derived from HPL lives Carter Wilcox (David Phillip Carollo), a young artist whose life is so pathetic that hes reduced to fetching rubbers for his roommate, Goth musician Erica Zann (Nicolette Le Faye). In between wanking to on-line sex bomb Missy Katonixx (Stephanie Anders), Carter becomes besotted with cynical escort Riley Whatley (Melissa OBrien), who has a cephalopodal birthmark on her butt. That also makes her an object of desire of the sinister Sebastian Suydum (Dave Gamble) of the Church of Starry Wisdom, who is murdering his way through the local call-girl population to find the destined bride of Cthulhu. At the same time, professor Edna Curwen (Helenmary Ball), assisted by bad-ass Squid (Sabrina Taylor-Smith) and a couple of lesbians who cant keep their hands off each other, tries to wrest a Necronomicon from Sebastians clutches to prevent him from unleashing a Lovecraftian hell on Earth.

All of these characters and more are swiftly introduced in the first act, and CALL GIRL OF CTHULHU keeps up a merry pace as they collide and commingle, assorted secondary players (including Baltimore fringe-cinema veteran George Stover) turn up in odd places and LaMartina bridges the scenes with a remarkably varied and sustained series of visual-pun transitions. He and his collaborators demonstrate that just because you're going lowbrow doesnt mean you cant be smart about it, and theres a cleverness amidst the blood, breasts and bodily fluids that a lot of Hollywood slummers could learn from. And though the movie may be wall-to-wall boobs in the first half, LaMartina and George take care to actually flesh out their principal female characters in the second, particularly Erica. For all of their roles surface snark, OBrien and Le Faye make for a most appealing pair of heroines, and Carollo, a last-minute casting choice who had never acted before, has the right balance of likability and naivet to carry us through this weird tale, grounded in Carters search for love in all the oddest places. There are some things man was never meant to understand, Squid says ominously. Yeah, I call them women, Carter replies.

The supporting cast all attack their roles with equal verve, enthusiastically throwing themselves into situations that often see them dowsed and dripping with gore and other sticky liquids. Lovecraft may have deigned to describe his unspeakable horrors in detail, but LaMartina takes the Stuart Gordon tack of visualizing them in all their tentacled, misshapen glory; kudos to Jason M. Koch and Kaleigh Brown for creating a string of gloriously grotesque sights on a very modest budget. The entirety of CALL GIRL OF CTHULHU, in fact, bespeaks a passion for creating fun, frightful fare, financial restrictions be damned. These days, B-movies in which all the effort seems to have gone into coming up with a goofy/hybrid title are almost a cottage industry; CALL GIRL OF CTHULHU is one happy occasion where it feels like the movie came first.

7331940,4,B011B33Z3I,"This is a movie for those who love gore, creature features, B-movies, and LovecraftIan lore. It has so much heart and the people involved in it clearly did their best with the budget they had and truly believed in the project but it's low budget and pretty cheesy. I watch it a couple times a year and it's one of my favorites. If you're not into B movies, tentacles, or gore this definitely isn't for you",1490745600,,405,4.342105263157895

7331949,1,B011B33Z3I,"Even though I knew what to expect, I was still disappointed. I love cheesy B movies and H.P. Lovecraft, but this was just plain bad.  The first half of this movie was almost unwatchable. The second was slightly better.
Yes, seeing all of the Lovecraft references was fun, but it still didn't justify sitting through this movie.",1458259200,2,327,4.7368421052631575
7331950,4,B011B33Z3I,"This was not a great movie, but I enjoyed it for what it was--B-grade Lovecraft horror. I thought the lead actors were pretty decent (though the supporting cast was not very convincing). I enjoyed it for its Cthulhuness (which was fun), the villain was enjoyably arch, and there were some pretty naked women.",1458000000,3,308,4.830188679245283
7331951,4,B011B33Z3I,"Campy and often over the top with sixties horror movie vibe. The constant little inside jokes related to Lovecraft and the mythos, make this a must have film.",1457308800,,158,4.678571428571429
7331952,4,B011B33Z3I,"OK, let's just get this out of the way. This is a throwback, ultra low budget, exploitation flick of the highest/lowest order. It's also geared to a fairly specific audience. If you chuckled; or even at least understood,  the joke in the movie's title, you're probably going to get some enjoyment out of this flick. If you go into it not knowing anything about HP Lovecraft's works, you may wind up terribly confused.

The basic premise is this...one of the prostitute's in this city has been born with a special birth mark which signifies that she is to be the bride of the ancient cosmic monster god, Cthulu. Said prostitute is being sought after by an evil cult, a rogue historian, and an infatuated young artist. Gore splattered chaos and nudity ensue.

I gave this movie four stars because I am a huge fan of both Lovecraft and B-Movies. As far as both of those go, this movie succeeds on many levels. There are so many little nods and inside jokes for Lovecraft fans that you will lose count. There are also significant amounts of T&A and gore to keep B Movie fans attention. The unknowns who worked on and in the film have done a pretty spectacular job with the meager budget that they had to work with and look like they had a good time doing it. This is an example of one of the purest forms of cinema. A movie by fans for fans.

This flick will never be able to stand toe to tentacle with the big studio horror movies, but have you seen the CG saturated crap that Hollywood has been spewing out lately? Take a chance on some of these lesser known indie horror movies and you may discover a few hidden gems here and there.

Go in with low expectations and you'll probably have a good time watching this odd low budget treat. If you're expecting The Conjuring or something, you're gonna be disappointed. Watch at your own discretion.",1457049600,15,1841,4.467261904761905

7331954,4,B011B33Z3I,"If you aren't a fan of low budget film, you shouldn't be reviewing this - this you got exactly what it's supposed to be, regardless of whether it's what you expected. The idea of this sort of thing is that people try to be as fun and outr as possible with little budget, and do outrageous things you can't get away with unless it's you and your buddies making your own film. It's sad that this has to be explained.
This one is a lot of fun. Lots of silly t and a and gore and tentacles, all as outlandish as can be. It isn't supposed to be scary, it isn't supposed to be porn. It isn't supposed to be serious cinema. Art can be like that.",1455926400,4,638,4.031496062992126

7331959,2,B011B33Z3I,"What to say about this movie? This is an unreviewable movie as it's so crazy. They are definitely going for a throwback exploitation vibe. Lots of nudity & gore. In fact, I think 90% of the actresses are in a state of undress and one time or another throughout the story. I give them stars for being creative with the story & having decent special effects in an obviously low low budget movie. I think most of the actors are from a local theater group. I'm just not sure if the movie worked thus the 2 stars. Everyone definitely had fun making this movie. If gory exploitation films are your interest, you will probably like this movie.",1446422400,10,636,4.444444444444445

8724012,5,B011B33Z3I,"Bought this expecting (and wanting) low budget trash and was pleasantly surprised at how smart, funny, and well written it was. The acting is hit or miss and the sound dubbing is off throughout, but the practical effects were great. Clever Lovecraft references throughout made this an absolute joy.

8724014,4,B011B33Z3I,"I was pleasantly surprised.

Overall this is low budget trash. There is over the top gore and violence along with needless nudity. Men's junk get mutilated and transformed. Women are mauled or converted into flesh and soul hungry beasts. The cast does a good job of being rather unlikable.

The story grabs at a lot of the low hanging fruit of the Cthulhu mythos. I'm not sure the story writers were really fans, its a lot more like someone heard an H.P. Lovecraft fan geeking over the stories and asked enough questions to make a script to poke fun at what they learned.

Keep kids away, this film has plenty of sex acts and nudity. There is only one character that wants sex to be meaningful and lets just say things couldn't have gone much worse for him.

The film is very low budget and looks it. The story is fairly weak. The dialog could use a lot of refinement.",1512604800,5,868,4.40625

8724017,4,B011B33Z3I,"This is a delightfully weird movie. It's on the lower budget side, but that's part of the charm. Lovecraft can count tons of references to his work from t-shirts characters are wearing, to character names and some of the songs. Do NOT play a Lovecraft reference drinking game, however. It will be painful.",1509580800,2,305,4.773584905660377
