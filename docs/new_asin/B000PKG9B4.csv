8192273,2,B000PKG9B4,did not enjoy this dvd like I thought I would not detailed enough for an Elvis fan will be a keepsake though,1393372800,,108,3.9545454545454546
8192274,1,B000PKG9B4,"SONNY WEST is the 1st one listed as INTERVIEWED, how absurd! SONNY WEST co-wrote a book (I won't name so ""curious people"" don't buy it & S. WEST gets money!) that I've read & those REALLY CLOSE to Elvis reported that Elvis read it before it was published & he was so overwhelmed by the many dirty lies in it, they believe it killed him, he committed suicide.  Elvis' Dad fired SONNY & RED WEST just before & they were furious.  They wrote the book with anger & as if they were psychologist & they needed money! Lamar Fike & the WESTS' were no where near Elvis in his Last 24 Hours, or weeks!  They were NOT ALLOWED INSIDE GRACELAND ANY MORE, so why in the world would SONNY WEST be listed 1st interviewed, if this was a true, factual film?!! Because it can not be!  I was floored to find that SONNY WEST has proved himself a heartless liar, by writing another book as being a close friend of Elvis', after the last one killed him (very believable after reading close reports)..........just for m-o-n-e-y!",1383523200,2,1004,4.410810810810811
8192275,4,B000PKG9B4,"I think they could have told a little more info on Elvis, most of what they told we already knew.
Yes I would tell other people to buy it if they didn't know much about Elvis on his death.
I do believe they should have made more then 24 hours of his death, I think if they would have made it about a week of his death it would tell us a little more for if you watch some Bios on Elvis he was fed up with the life he had.",1363824000,2,420,3.6263736263736264
8192276,3,B000PKG9B4,"buyer beware..the running time says 120 minutes,but when i got my copy it runs 55 minutes.also on the back under special features it has listed ""elvis' last letter"",""revealing personality report"",and ""Elvis'Autopsy Report"".none of these items are on this disc.other than that,it's pretty good.
IT IS JUST TOO SHORT.",1288396800,14,315,5.583333333333333
8192277,5,B000PKG9B4,"Elvis Presley The last 24 Hours has got to be the best dvd I have seen about the death of Elvis. Everyone interviewed here is completely sincere. You can see the pain and sincerity in their eyes when they speak. These men are not actors. They are friends of Elvis that cared immensely about him. It is amazing how affected they are even after 30 years since his death.

There are interviews with Sonny West, Lamar Fike, Marty Laker, Billy Smith, Joe Espisito, Jerry Schilling, and Larry Geller. Being a true fan of Elvis, it's difficult not to feel what these guys are feeling when they speak. Billy Smith's account of the last days of Elvis is difficult to watch as he relives such a painful experience. Larry Geller gives a powerful and effective interview in this dvd that has got to be seen by any true Elvis fan.

Anyone even remotely considering that Elvis might have faked his death needs to watch this dvd. After seeing these very personal and emotional interviews and taking into consideration the details surrounding his death it becomes very clear. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone interested in the final days of Elvis.",1218499200,42,1136,4.675
8192278,4,B000PKG9B4,"This is a very well done documentary featuring interviews with Jerry Schilling, Joe Esposito, Marty Lacker, Lamar Fike, Sonny West, and Billy Smith.

Not much is covered here that we haven't seen before, but I've always enjoyed hearing the boys talk about Elvis, regardless of what people think about his entourage.

The only downside to this documentary, is that Lamar Fike drops a few F bombs, so it's not kid friendly. All in all it is a nice package for the price, and great for any Elvis fan. TCB.",1186099200,36,502,4.629213483146067
