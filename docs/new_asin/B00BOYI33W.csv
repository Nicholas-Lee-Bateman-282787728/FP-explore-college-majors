8572056,4,B00BOYI33W,"Bad subtitles, good movie.  Strange mix of the dark and the comedic, especially given the subject matter.  Some melodrama, too; but, hey, it's a Korean movie after all. 3-1/2 stars.",1432771200,,181,5.0
8572057,1,B00BOYI33W,I could not watch this video to the end because it stopped by itself. I don't know if the problem with the streaming video or my internet connection but I was able to watch some other video with no problem at all.,1388620800,,213,4.095238095238095
8572058,3,B00BOYI33W,Pretty good story line but darn slow and at times annoying.  Koreans love to portray their law enforcement as stupid.,1380153600,2,117,4.85
8572059,1,B00BOYI33W,I love Korean movies and drama but I couldn't watch this one.  The translation (English subtitles) went from hard to understand to just a bunch of jumbled words.  After a few minutes I was not able to follow the story.  Unless you speak/understand Hanguel you might want to pass this one by.,1379721600,,291,4.5576923076923075
8572060,5,B00BOYI33W,"It starts off as another police procedural movie, but turns into a very real examination of how ordinary people's lives are strained and sometimes torn apart by ordinary but powerful circumstances. I was touched by the restrained acting of key characters, that afforded dignity to their private tragedies. We get to see the intimate feelings of members of three families--the main character cop and his son, the young cop and his father, and all the family members of the autistic child. Among them, the actress playing the mother has done a truly intelligent and superb job. I am haunted by her expressions. I will be thinking about this movie for a while. No, I will be feeling this movie for a while.",1374883200,8,703,4.770491803278689
