2145511,5,B0002YHFZC,"This video made me wish I was able to go to one of their concerts. If you play guitar, it will make you want Jack's red and white Gibson Firebird.

This disc is better than most live concert videos. The low-fi video works, and the cut aways are timed well. They do a few covers, so there is some material on here that isn't on their four major releases.",1102291200,,353,4.115942028985507
2145512,5,B0002YHFZC,"The music is ragged, rough, and dirty...so it only makes sense that the look of this concert dvd should be too. Incredible, high-energy performance throughout nicely captured here. Jack plays and sings like a man possessed.... Check it out!",1102204800,,240,5.17948717948718
2145513,5,B0002YHFZC,"Like your previous reviewers, I was also at one of the 2 gigs filmed for this release. It was the first time I had seen The Stripes and afterwards I rated it as one of the most exciting perfomances I had witnessed in over 30 years of attending rock concerts.
There is,  of course,  the danger that a film of a concert you attended failing to match up to the memory you have of it. This is not the case with this DVD. The 8mm grainy film quality certainly adds to the atmosphere. You can almost feel the sweat from the audience as they bounce up and down on the sprung ballroom floor, despite the fact that it was below freezing outside on that cold January evening. There are no extras, just the concert, which is how it should be. The packaging is nice though. Buy it now. Highly recommended to get you jumping around the room.",1102032000,10,828,4.267515923566879
2145514,5,B0002YHFZC,"I happened to catch the preview for this DVD on MTV2 the other day and it was fantastic!  I ended up watching it from start to finish and being late for work!  While I'm not a big fan of concerts on DVD, the remake of Jolene and Jack White's passionate vocals make it the best live performance I've seen on TV since Nirvana did Unplugged.",1101945600,,338,4.184615384615385
2145515,5,B0002YHFZC,"Ok, I know this is a lil unfair to review something before it comes out, but I see people do it on here all the time so... I signed up to this amazon.com review thing just to tell you to buy this!  I, along with the rest of my band Anti Talent, know it will be good!  Every White Stripes CD is amazing, and live in concert they are mouth wateringly delicious!  Buy this DVD, and then go see them live; you won't regret it!  We're also hoping to go see a theater showing of this movie, so that should be killer!  Ok, well there's my two cents... oh and if you're bored and wanna check out some more Detroit area punk rock 'n' roll, check out our band Anti Talent at antitalent.com  There's a lame plug, but as my grandpa always says, ""You gotta do somethin'.""  But more importantly, long live the White Stripes!

Yet to recieve the DVD but if it is 1% of the performance on the night then EVERYONE should own it!

My buddy and I had to ghetto rig some stuff to get the DVD to play on his TV. It didn't play in the two DVD players he has in his house, but it did eventually work on his portable disc drive. Completely my fault for not reading that part.

Awesome concert. It's filmed in a gritty format but I feel that's how The White Stripes should be captured.

I'm biased because I love this band, so take my review for what it's worth",1416787200,,474,4.075268817204301

2145545,4,B0002YHFZC,"Under the Blackpool Lights gives us a more raw and slightly less dynamic Jack White. It's a great concert and a must have for any White Stripes fan. Keep in mind, however, that at this point in their career they had only recorded albums up through Elephant, so if you're looking for songs from Icky Thump or Get Behind Me Satan you will be disappointed.",1377734400,2,353,4.446153846153846

2145547,1,B0002YHFZC,"I have been searching high and low for this DVD, it is a collectors items and something I planned to treasure deeply. When I received the disc, one which, mind you, I paid almost $40 dollars for, it was not able to play on any of my DVD or Blu-Ray players because of compatability issues. This was highly disappointing. I now have an extremely fancy visual reminder of what might have been, and if I ever go to Europe, I will rest easy knowing I can play this disc, the so called PAL, on the televisions of any friends I may make. For future reference and in the interest of disclosure, please put what format the DVD is in, so before spending this kind of money, I can see what I am getting into.

This blows Under Great White Northern Lights completely out of the water then blows it up again once it's out of the water. So I'd definitely recommend this, actually I'd demand this.

2145563,5,B0002YHFZC,I have seen the White Stripes live 5 times in person.  They were a great live show.  So I was so happy to get this DVD.  It shows them raw and amazing. I love this DVD.  The crowd is great and Jack and Meg are simply killing it.  Although they got better musically on there later tours.  The energy at this show is second to non.  I can watch it over and over again.  This is a band that will be missed.  But thank God this period was captured on film.  A must see.  *****,1300579200,,472,3.863157894736842

2145565,5,B0002YHFZC,"OMG!  $70 dollars for the DVD.  I remember when it first came out and I bought a copy (which I STILL own) from an old Sam Goodie (Remember those?) for $14.95!!  So would I buy it for seventy dollars or more now?  Yes indeed I would.  To explain understand that I am a huge White Stripes fan (if you are buying this for a big WS fan read no more, just buy the damn thing!) and if I like something I get it. Now this being as expensive as it is I would hesitate to buy, however, because I have seen the DVD before and knowing what is on it I would save to buy it.  Under Blackpool Lights is the Ultimate concert experience.  The sound quality of the DVD is amazing, plug that into 5:1, sounds like being there.  Just the flow of the DVD and quality of the music being played, the video creativity of Third Man Inc, it is just an awesome DVD.  I think it came out in 2004 and since my original purchase I have watched it countless times.  My personal favorites would be Death Letter, Ball and Biscuit, Goin' Back to Memphis, De Ballt of de Boll Weevil, which curiously, all but one are covers.  But the best part is the dance at the very end..... along with a closing number from Hank Sr.  Awesome.....",1291507200,3,1199,4.142857142857143

2145577,5,B0002YHFZC,"I absolutely love this dvd.  Raunchy, crunching guitar riffs; ear-splitting guitar solos; Jack's blazing, tortured vocals; and Meg's driving beat make for a live show that will lock you in a trance.  I love the way it was shot as well; especially with all of the over-produced junk that is out there.  Its refreshing to see and hear a band that has such raw talent and such a passion for what they are doing.  The White Stripes are, without a doubt, one of greatest modern rock bands out there. And I really don't care what people say about meg, because she's brilliant.  Her style is all part of the fun and you can tell shes having a blast. (Simplicity is what makes them so painfully good.)  Being as they don't have a set list, its impressive how she so effortlessly keeps up with Jack.  The physical quality of the actual dvd is perfect.  If it were given to me as a gift, I would have never known that it was used. Not a single, tiny scratch on it.  Rarely have I been so satisfied with a purchase and I know for a fact that I will watch this over and over again (I already have).",1259539200,2,1086,4.258536585365854
2145578,5,B0002YHFZC,"By far the best white stripes dvd yet. They jam many songs in a row, and most are from the prime era of white blood cells, elephant, & (self titled).",1255651200,,149,4.0
2145579,5,B0002YHFZC,"I've been meaning to get this video for over a year, having seen some of its songs on YouTube. It's hard to find locally and I kept putting off ordering it online. I finally did, and I'm thrilled. If you are on the band's wavelength - that is, if you appreciate their chemistry, their love of music, their individuality within deliberately chosen confines, their excellent lyrics and passionate performances - this will become one of your favorite DVDs. If you are not on the band's wavelength (yet) and just want to experience a great show, it'll serve that purpose also.

It was recorded on two consecutive nights, with editing between some of the songs to splice the two shows into one. Jack and Meg deliberately wore identical clothes to keep this from being obvious - but if you pay attention, you'll notice the word on Jack's right arm goes from ""noxious"" to ""obnoxious"" randomly. Meg added the ""ob"" with a Sharpie for the second night. Another bit of trivia is that Meg was suffering from the flu and feeling pretty awful, which I think you can see in a few places, like when she takes a break halfway through Going Back to Memphis - but it doesn't hurt the performance.",1245369600,,1177,4.604761904761904
2145580,5,B0002YHFZC,"Wow, now this is a concert DVD, just insane.  Seeing a band like this in their prime, doesn't much matter if your not a fan, this is an amazing concert.  I don't much care for their studio stuff, its ok, but live is another story.  This captures it all.  I have seen them live in Hollywood, 1st row, right in front of Meg.  That was awesome to say the least.  Hopefully they will re-release this and I hope to see more concert dvd's from them.",1239148800,,443,4.152941176470589
2145581,5,B0002YHFZC,"There have already been plenty of reviews on this one, so I'm just point out a few things. Jack and Meg perform at their very best, and ""man"" are they GOOD!!! This concert DVD Rocks!!! They do some blues classics such as Lead Belly's ""Take a Whiff on Me"", and they do the Dolly Parson classic of ""Jolene"". I have never heard these classics performed so good.
This is a ""Classic"" concert DVD and will stand the test of time in my opinion. It's a must-have for any White Stripes fan.",1234656000,2,481,4.2967032967032965

2145583,1,B0002YHFZC,"I am VERY disappointed in Amazon.  I have been using them for some time but this outrages me!  This DVD is $9.99 at Newbury Comics!!!
BUT Amazon was selling it new for $200.00 and used for $99.99.
I thought because of the pricing that it was a rare DVD or had something special to it and I purchaed it for my fiance for Christmas since he loves the White Stripes.  The concert is very bad quality and I could not understand why it was priced so high or what was special about it.
You can imagine how disappointed, duped and outraged I felt that this very same DVD is only $9.99 at Newbury Comics.  It is in BAD taste and is stealing from your customers to allow this to be sold for $200.00.
I am not happy.  And frankly, I want my $100.00 back or I won't be shopping at Amazon every again.  And whoever sold me this piece of junk, you are a thief.",1232236800,,847,4.1030303030303035

I really appreciate the item, my husband loved it. He is a big White Stripes fine. Thanks for sending it so quickly!",1231200000,,272,4.230769230769231
2145585,4,B0002YHFZC,"The performance was supercharged, wild, psychotic and amazing at the same time. Jack is very drunk (at least i think) and he is commiting a murder of his guitar in front a lot of people. I wish I could've at least stood outside for this one, two people can make a whole lot of noise in one setting. I only gave this 4 stars because I wish they could've at least finished one song, just one and I would've gave it a 5. This is definitely something you should buy if you love them, but not if you're just getting into them, you may not be at the time in your muscial life when you can appreciate it for what it really is. If you like this then you'll probably like the concert DVD the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have out. Thier also a garage band and they make some wild music. BuY This! I got it on Ebay for 24 dollars.",1229990400,,807,4.0186335403726705
2145586,3,B0002YHFZC,"I love the White Stripes, and have since they first came out when some weirdo at a bar gave me a demo.  I have been to see them live twice and was consistently blown away at their live performance.  So why the low score on this review?  Meg and Jack were spot on as always, unfortunately this video both looks and sounds as if it were shot on a cell phone.  Now I was okay with the grainy video, I know they are an anti-establishment band and the grainy look goes with their vibe.  It would have been nice had it been inter cut with some higher quality shots so that we could actually see both Jack and Meg, specifically since they are such wonderful entertainers.

My biggest problem is with the sound, it's the tinny metallic sound of someone recording without being plugged into the sound board.  The same as if you were to take a camera to the concert and record it yourself, the quality just isn't there.  Sadly I couldn't listen though this from beginning to end because the terrible sound made Jack sound as if he was mumbling and the guitar just sounded terrible, I ended up with a migraine rather than a fun evening of dirty Detroit rock.  If you didn't already know the words to his music, you certainly won't be able to pick them out on this DVD.

I love the band, and had really high hopes for this DVD, unfortunately I am very happy that I rented rather than purchased.  True all of their great songs are included on the DVD, they just don't sound any good.  And since you can't really make out what they are doing due to the grainy video, you really can't get into the vibe of it all.  I hope that their next DVD will be more professionally produced, because if this had sounded half as good as their live show I would have bought it directly.

For now stick with the CDs.",1219536000,,1786,4.276785714285714

the visuals are amazing,, it has a vintage / old school look and the camera angles make you feel like you at the actual concert,, the visuals go with the music perfectly,,

Having never heard any White Stripes music (although I knew the name)I was pretty impressed by GBMS. SO being a good little surfer, visited TWS website where they have several videos to view. There you will find their cover of Jolene..which was taken from the concert featured on this DVD.

Upon seeing this video...I knew I HAD to see the whole show.

Blown away, stunned, and instantly addicted to The White Stripes. Other reviewers have attempted to describe what this DVD is like. So I will not rehash. It must be seen to be believed. Powerful, emotional, and a flat out steal at this price. If I could give it 10 or 100 stars I would.",1139529600,14,724,4.43609022556391
2145608,5,B0002YHFZC,"I have never had the privilege to see the White Stripes live, but this was an excellent substitute. Even sitting in the comfort of my own home, I wanted to jump up and pogo with the audience. Ever hear people say they have a hole in their sound? Ha! Watch this my friend. Prepare to get a hurricane of sound thrown your way, with the energy and electricty of a lightning storm. Jack is like a mad scientist on stage, constantly tweeking, switching, improvising, concocting fantastic potions of sound. Raw, undiluted, pure- the way any performance should be. Watching this makes you wonder why other bands bother with 2 or 3 more members. I read a review of one of their performances once where the guy said how you can't believe you got your ass kicked my just two people. Exactly. If you're not already a believer, this performance should make you one.

In their version of Jolene, Jack wails with the pain and intensity of someone who knows the sentiment of the song.

As you watch, you begin to understand that, unlike most bands who get up on stage and showboat and puke out what's on their CD, the White Stripes get on stage to please themselves, and along the way ultimately satisfy anyone listening. As you watch, mesmerized, admiring Jack's mad genius, you can't help but scream inside yourself, ""IT'S ALIVE!!!""",1139097600,5,1319,4.656652360515022
2145609,5,B0002YHFZC,"Before I stopped into the store and picked this album up, I had pretty bunch stopped buying music for six months and was content to listen to the Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles and The White Stripes playlist I seemed to have running at the time among many other things, when I bought this Video I had the latter 3 White Stripes albums.  This video changed the direction I was heading musically,  I have since purchased the first two White Stripes albums and many others as this has relit the musical fire that had been smuldering over and not ignited launched into any particular direction.  This DVD has actually changed my life, I have purchased, Robert Johnson, Son House, Charley Patton, as well as all the White Stripes albums as said earlier and am on a musical tear to find out as much as possible as to what developed Jack White into the man he is today.

  The Concert is one of the most enthralling things I have ever seen in my life. After a couple minutes into it, it becomes truly apparent that you are witness to something very special.  I own quite a few concert DVDs (not bragging,) and this is one I will watch over and over again.  Jack Whites rendition of Dolly Partons ""Jolene"" is on par with a performance of Stairway to heaven.  His Dylan covers and every single song he runs through on his 90 minute tear are all five star performances.  I would suggest this DVD to any music fan above almost everything else.

The filming is as edgy and grainy as their music and they exude a raw presence that a whole lot of bands strive for but few attain.

For those who question their musical talent: check out Jack throughout the entire show - his playing is really remarkable. As for Meg's drumming - I don't think anyone could do better or add to their performance. (Sometimes it's true that you can have `too many notes.')

2145622,5,B0002YHFZC,"Perfection.  Absolute perfection.  But before you go away, let me say ... when I wrote this review, there were 48 existing reviews, and I noticed something interesting.  Looking through the archive, I found two of the most shocking sentences on any Amazon item review page, especially one with 50 reviews:

1. ""There are no two-star reviews.""

2. ""There are no one-star reviews.""

This speaks volumes.  In the rock world, the White Stripes are often one of the most controversial bands--not because they incite social controversy (although it's arguable), but because they're what one of the three-star reviewers here referred to as a band that makes good music by using weak musicians.  Now, don't get me wrong, I personally think Jack White is a brilliant musician, but I understand the point, especially since the reviewer is a teacher of guitar.  The White Stripes are raw, exciting--carnal, almost.  I challenge ANY fan of music in ANY genre to give this DVD a good, fair watch or listen, and not be drawn in.  It's exciting, fast, and draws you as close to the souls of these two musicians as you can get without going to an actual live concert.  And please, eventually do that, too.",1128729600,4,1189,4.8316831683168315
2145623,4,B0002YHFZC,"I being fairly new to the White Stripes scene, saw them play for the first time on  one of the awards shows which I believe was the MTV music awards 2004. I became interested and intrigued by the two person raw energy rock blast. I found this DVD to be an untamed electric charge of raw  pure white hot plasma, just like the duo who is the White Stripes. For two people they sure make a lot of music. Completely ingrossing and utterly enjoyable. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The only thing I did not like was the fuzzy style camera filter{which personally I do not enjoy}, I would think that having a clear and many angled focus, would have been much better. I'm not saying this fuzzy filter did  not fit the Stripes style, but as a director its a move I would not have made. Minus one star for the cam work. Great music, great show. I like the White Hot Stripes.",1127606400,4,875,4.196428571428571
2145624,4,B0002YHFZC,"If you are a White Stripes fan who did not really feel the new record, I've gotta tell you something. If you do not own ""Under Blackpool Lights"" then I've gotta tell you to buy it because, for one thing, I really shouldn't have to need anything to back it up with, but if you really want to know why someone would, well here's why:

It's got all of the stuff that the Stripes did before that album. Besides, there are some things that are worthy of being seen. I thought the guitar solo on the studio version of ""Ball and Buscuit"" was great, but listen to this on the DVD. It's amazing how it sounds on here. That is one of the reasons you should buy it.

If you're a casual fan, don't worry. Even though Jack doesn't ever perform his stateside breakthrough, most of the hits are performed anyway. I really like the drum clicking of ""The Hardest Button to Button"" and the crowd seemed excited too. Also performed was easily their most popular song ever, ""Seven Nation Army"". It's performed basically how you'd expect. But then again, this live DVD was pretty much what I expected.

Even when the electric piano is used like in ""Apple Blossom"" or the organs on ""Truth Doesn't Make a Noise"", he doesn't forget to rock with the guitar.

You also get two Son House covers in a row (both faithful in that they are both done very bluesy), the great ""Jolene"" rendition (which you may have heard), as well as covers from obscure bands who only really were known in their local areas.

There's also the big morph they have after the first two songs, which includes covers of Bob Dylan and Ledbetter. There's also two original Stripes songs in that mix as well as another cover.

It did not thrill me like the Cure's ""Trilogy"" DVD, but nothing really does to be honest. It just gets a four because for whatever reason I feel that there was something missing, I don't really know what it was. I don't know if the DVD I had was the problem, but the sound quality was even a bit rough for my tastes in general. But I don't understand how you won't like this if you like the White Stripes.",1127347200,3,2075,4.362694300518135

We need more more White Stripes give your fans another memorible peformance like at Blackpool please.

2145626,4,B0002YHFZC,"With just a slip to the left or the right, this could've been cheese or, worse, the band's miniature aesthetic could've been dwarfed by the surroundings.

But ""Under Blackpool Lights"" has been put together with the same stark simplicity that makes the band so unique. Jack and Meg sling out one song after another -- Jack does his Robert-Plant-caught-in-a-wringer howl and moan; his guitars wail; Meg, sans shoes, pounds drums; fuzzy, red-lit crowds of fans roil all around and hand-held cameras capture the whole thing. It's gritty, it's grainy, it's groovin' and it's great.

Here's what they play (in just about an hour and a half):

1) ""When I Hear My Name""

2)""Black Math""

3) ""Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground""

2145627,4,B0002YHFZC,"One of the most wierd concerts to be seen. I enjoyed it for what it was. An 8mm recording this day in time is kinda backwards in itself, huh? I suppose that's kinda their motto though. Simple sounding rock & roll. The two of them are the ""entire"" band remember....",1123891200,3,264,4.3
2145628,4,B0002YHFZC,"The White Stripes are a group that prides themselves on cut and dry simplicity, allowing their music to speak for each album and video release.  Their latest release, Under The Blackpool Lights is no exception.  In an age where most musicians will drop hundreds of thousands of dollars for the latest and greatest in digital recording, the Stripes go against the grain, filming on old-style 8mm reels and using nothing but prehistoric analog equipment.

Surprisingly, the DVD is very well mixed and the sound quality has suffered not a bit.  Jack White's performance is energetic, motivated, and most importantly; competant.  A lot of groups who release DVD live shows fail to grasp the concept of playing for the camera.  The White Stripes pull it off not just acceptably, but skillfully.

As for the visual aesthetics, don't expect a lot.  The entire concert is washed by their trademark blood red, white and black colors.  All in all living up to the legacy the peppermint duo have carved for themselves in the Alternative Rock scene.

If you have any appreciation for the days when blues and rock were about so much more than aggression, death and drugs give this DVD a chance.  It just may revive the foot-thumpin, head bobbing, sing-alone side of you that you thought was long dead and buried.",1123545600,4,1299,4.859090909090909
2145638,5,B0002YHFZC,"This DVD captures the wonderful, unique nature of the White Stripes so well. Unpolished and raw, you get the impression that their years of mainstream success has not tainted their original passion in the slightest; it is easy to imagine them playing exactly the same in some tiny Detroit venue. The grainy film gives the performance extra ambiance (and complements the black/red/white colour scheme perfectly!).

The setlist includes many classic cover versions (my favorite is Jolene - its even more powerful than the studio version) and great reworkings of their own songs. I've seen the band live myself, and this is compares favourably to that. Bascially, if you want a flavour of this band playing live, or want to relive your own experience of them, I recommend this DVD :)",1122595200,3,780,5.0

I'd heard the hype, and frankly, I resisted even giving them a chance.  I'd heard it before countless times about so many other nameless bands shoved down our throats by the record industry... but The White Stripes are the REAL DEAL.  It comes thru that they do this because the LOVE it, not to be famous or to make money, blah blah blah - it's who they are.  Buy this DVD and you will see what the love of THE MUSIC is all about.  Forget the hype, the marketing, the demographics, the INDUSTRY - just grab your guitar(or drumsticks) and PLAY!",1120089600,2,686,4.190839694656488
2145640,5,B0002YHFZC,"This DVD is awesome!!!  I had always thought the White Stripes were great, but I had no idea how good they were in concert until now.  The film itself is also a well-edited and fine compliment to the atmosphere set by Jack and Meg.  The grainy quality just reflects their minimalist style.  The setlist is also great, with all their hits, including ""De Ballit of De Boll Weevil,"" which, for some reason, I always find myself singing in the shower.  It can also change your mind about some tracks you didn't like before.  For example, I never really got into songs like ""When I Hear My Name,"" ""Black Math,"" ""Do,"" or ""The Big Three"" until I heard them in concert.  In fact, every song they play sounds better live.  As a whole, the movie is great and definitely worth buying if you're into the White Stripes.  Now, the review aside, does anybody out there have extra Midtown Music Festival tickets they don't want?  I've been trying to get tickets the last three weeks so I could see the White Stripes before they go to Argentina or wherever without paying $200 for the tickets.  I mean it's crazy!

2145641,5,B0002YHFZC,"We've all watched a live musical performance.  Be it at a concert, on tv or a dvd like this one.  Sometimes we are disappointed by video presentations.  I have seen The White Stripes live in concert and have also seen this presentation which should be an example of how these items should be. Good sound quality, nice shots, impeccable camerawork, and THE BAND.

The grainy 8 mm style gives the presentation a very vintage feel as it should with Jack an Meg's musical style. Their performance is incredible, playing their hits and also some rare and obscure tracks including an amazing cover of Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"".  The band plays so well, they gave me chills watching it just as they did when I saw them in concert.

2145643,5,B0002YHFZC,"The grainy visage of this film perfectly mirrors The White Stripes approach to music......down and dirty. By stripping their rock down to it's basic elements, taken a step further by the absence of a bassist, Jack and Meg White manage to create a curiously powerful racket, that translates quite well in this live setting. From the first fuzz-bathed chords Jack strums on his guitar, you can tell your gonna be in for a pulverizing ride. The dim lighting and splotchy video only add to the primal mystique of the bands incendiary performances and with an assorted batch of tunes from all their studio albums the White Stripes prove themselves to be arguably more compelling in their crude live incarnation.

Often, the band shows off their improvisational skills which frequently find Jack White playing his guitar with a blues-possessed ferociousness that was only hinted at on record. Couple that with Meg White's seductive drumming and it's easy to see why this band has garnered such buzz and attention. From ""Fell in Love With A Girl"" to the dramatic reading of Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"" to the raucous medley that finally dissipates into ""Seven Nation Army,"" the Stripes prove that they're no sloutches. With a superb filming job, this DVD gets you about as close to the actual feeling of being in attendance as one could imagine. While it's a great snapshot of a great band taking care of business, it's also a testament to the power of The White Stripes gritty version of rock and roll and one truly terrific concert film.",1111968000,4,1528,4.876923076923077

The first time i watched it it was 2:00 in the morning and i had a midterm the next day, i decided it watch a few songs and go to bed.  I watched the entire thing and then went back to watch the solos again.  this is the best thing that i own. from the time you start watching to the very last acidic smash of jacks guitar you're so locked in your face could be on fire and you wouldnt know it.  this is the most hard rocking peice of brilliance that money can buy. get it now",1111276800,7,547,3.7719298245614037
2145645,3,B0002YHFZC,"I agree with all the people praising the raw energy and emotion of this show. The performance of ""Jolene"" (a great song from Dolly Parton which shows country doesn't always suck) is manic.

However, let's not get carried away with calling Jack a great guitar player or Meg a great drummer. Having taught guitar (and played in Jazz/Funk bands) for 35 years Jack White is a terrible guitar player technically. It works for The White Stripes and gives them a raw edge but it's not musicianship. When you miss as many notes as Jack does, and you can count them by the dozens on this DVD, then it may be energetic/raw but it isn't good. Similarly, Meg doesn't as much drum as tap occasionally, Meg won't be confused with Gene Krupa or Neil Peart anytime soon.

Great music from poor musicians.",1110326400,2,788,4.581560283687943

The band plays a good number of tunes from each of their albums as well as a number of improvised blues songs. Many of the songs have been sped up and/or re-interpreted here, so don't expect to fork out $20 to hear the same old renditions as on cd. From the oldest to the newest song, Jack and Meg inject a great deal of life into their performance. Some highlights include the heart-wrenchingly passionate, 'Jolene', and the blistering 'Death Letter' which will leave fans drooling as they watch. The concert was filmed with Super 8, so the film has a grainy feel that certainly adds to the live experience. The show has also been edited superbly, with numerous camera angles and lots of great close-ups that give you the feel that you're right on stage with the band and yet right in the middle of the screaming crowd. The audio quality of the performance is pristine, and before viewing you should choose the audio setup that suits your entertainment system best (DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2 speaker stereo)- believe me, it will make a huge difference in the quality and brilliance of the sound.

But with any new/popular style, you get the groundbreakers, one of which is The White Stripes. The garage rock revival has brought a lot of great music to people who felt suffocated by the nausea infested, overproduced pop music, with little to know substance. ""Under Blackpool Lights"" shows Jack White as the blues/rock guitar god that he is.

Despite the presence of any special features whatsoever, the concert rocks enough on it's own to justify the purchase. The sound is excellent, and the picture is so-so, which gives you that real ""garage rock"" feel. It's just Jack and Meg up there, rocking the show to it's fullest. Jack jams out a hell of a show, belting out solos flawlessly. Meg is her usual self, swaying her head around in tranquility, feeding off of the energy that Jack puts forth. The unity between the two really stands out.

The White Stripes are the real thing. Here is the proof.",1106524800,2,1053,4.625668449197861

Meg White is a solid drummer - a perfect complement to the guitar wailings of Jack. That's it folks, two musicians who make more music than larger bands.

The energy is astounding. The audio recording is beautiful. The visuals are intentionally grainy, but I find it enhances the experience. Overall, the package is very well done. There are no frills. You put the DVD in and the concert begins.

The White Stipes is all this and more. They're quite simply the best ""real"" rock and roll band performing today. In a world of prepackaged, computer generated garbage that gets past off as ""music"", the White Stripes are proudly carrying the torch.

The chemistry between Jack and Meg is amazing. I've never seen a band this much in synch since Led Zeppelin with John Bohnam. They literally can finish each other's sentences (musically speaking).

If you've only heard the White Stripes on radio or CD, then get this DVD. The true measure of a band is whether or not they can cut it live. The White Stripes could easily wipe the floor with any other live act performing today.",1105660800,2,896,4.737179487179487

No matter what anyone says about ""musicianship,"" this concert is an electrifying showcase of raw physical energy. Watching Jack White play slide guitar on ""Death Letter"" is all the proof anyone needs that blues and rock are blood relatives. Under his spell, the familiar toe-tapping Son House dirge culminates in a frenzied chord-crunching finale that'll send chills up and down your spine. Fans who buy this DVD will fall in love with White Stripes songs all over again, thanks to Jack's new twists on already searing riffs (like the opening of Hardest Button to Button) and his playfulness with vocals.

The cinematography is a little self-consciously ""indie"" and the the film is left with a grainy and raw quality, much like the band's music. There are a couple of different cameras used on stage and then few shots from handheld cameras in the audience.

The music itself is excellent, Jack and Meg have really hit their stride performing live. Whereas some of their earlier performances had a jumply hyperactive quality, they have now learned to pace their material for dramatic effect without losing any of the raw energy that makes them so exciting. Highlights are many, but of particular note are Jack's slide guitar playing on Son House's immortal ""Death Letter Blues"" which also works in the House classic ""Grinnin' in Your Face"" as well. Leadbells really inspires the band and they take great pleasure in performing ""Boll Wevil Blues"" as the set ender. Original material shines as well, from the bluesy grind of ""Ball and Biscuit"" to the relative tranquility of ""Apple Blossom.""

2145672,3,B0002YHFZC,"OK, to start off with, I have to say that I am a HUGE fan of the White Stripes. What I hear in this video is nothing less than what is expected of these two incredible musicians. The problem is with the editing.

Get past the grainy video. I've done plenty videos of live concerts, and even with all the gadgets available it still is difficult to pull a good crisp image from a distance of a band performing live. My biggest problem with this vid is that it was totally expected. Fast quick shots jumping from different angles and not giving the viewer much of an experience of the characters.

What is it with contemporary video editors? Can they get it through their thick skull that there are people who would really like to see static or extended shots of the performers doing what they do best? (play)

I certainly can't dog this video, because the music generates the flavor of the duo, however it comes to mind that this disc could be played without the video and be equally enjoyable. (Hmm, sounds more like a cd to me)

Regardless, if you are a big WS fan I still highly recommend you get this cut. Just don't expect to see any of gritty profiles and expessions of Jack or Meg for anything more than 3 seconds. Too bad, because we all love watching them express their music.",1103587200,16,1283,4.378151260504202

That boy Jack White has studied the blues masters and seems to have made the same deal with the devil that Robert Johnson did. His playing is positively possessed: an over-amped guitar sound that reminded me both of Hendrix and Blue Cheer's Leigh Stephens, a voice between young Robert Plant and Janis Joplin. The drummer is perfect: solid, beautiful, and very cool. No stage gimmickry or back-up dancers, just an electrifying couple setting the night on fire.

The Directing is  wonderful for the use of the Super 8mm. The close ups on Jack shows you just how crazy Jack is when he plays and just how passionate Meg is when she is playing her drums. The band also has a great chemistry with the crowd as Jack and Meg thanks them after the show and gives the a little ""God Bless."" The White Stripes are the saviors of rock and roll, and for that, that is why they are my FAVORITE band.

The audio quality is brilliant, the performance is past even their usual high standard. The grainy film may be annoying for some people, but, to me, it is classic White Stripes and doesn't detract from the film at all.

Jack White's guitar playing is unbelievable and the band has a stunning onstage presence, especially considering there are only the two of them. I saw the band live in Detroit last year, and this film captures their live energy as well as could be expected, but nothing even compares to actually being there.

The tracklisting has the standard elements of a post-Elephant show, opening with ""When I Hear My Name"" and ""Black Math"" and ending with ""Boll Weevil."" However, it also includes some rare live songs, most notably ""I Fought Pirhanas,"" from their first album, and the mixes of ""Death Letter""/""Grinnin In Your Face"" and ""Let's Build A Home""/""Goin' Back To Memphis."" Disappointingly absent is ""Fell In Love With A Girl,"" but, overall, the included songs are the best the White Stripes have to offer in a live performance.

There are actually a few extras, but you have to find them on your own... Mr. White wouldn't want it to be too easy to get at the extras, you know? Another review mentioned Jack's guitar as a Gibson Firebird... Live, Jack has three guitars with him- a 1964 Airline, a Kay hollowbody and a Domino Dawson, the main guitar being the red and white Airline. He uses the Airline (made of plastic!) for most of the songs except the ones that require a slide, such as ""Seven Nation Army,"" ""Death Letter,"" and ""I Fought Pirhanas.""

While nothing can compare to the White Stripes' actual live performance, this DVD is the closest you'll get without actually being there. The White Stripes are one of the best rock bands around today, and I highly recommend purchasing this DVD - and their albums, if you haven't heard them already.",1102723200,22,1988,4.671428571428572
2145701,5,B0002YHFZC,"The White Stripes have done what no other modern rock band can; kick ass. In a market which is dominanted by garbage, The White Stripes are the only REAL rock band out there. Everyone else pales in comparison. Are you listening Jet? This DVD shows just how raw and powerful the Stripes are live. My only hope is that this album is released as an audio CD at some point in the near future.",1102723200,,388,4.256756756756757
2145702,5,B0002YHFZC,"Out of about 30 music related DVD's I own this is in the top three! If your a guitar player like myself you'll be in heaven , just pure raw tube amp tone and emotional high energy playing. And being able to sing and play like that at the same time is quite impressive. Jack plays like a man possesed and Meg puts the hurt on the drums.

Lots of good up close shots on the guitar so you get to see Jacks style/technique up close. Pretty nice.

If you were a skeptic before you'll be a believer after seeing this video.",1102723200,2,517,4.0588235294117645
2145703,5,B0002YHFZC,"I saw The White Stripes play in a smaller venue just before they blew up, and it was one of the best live shows I have ever seen.  This DVD captures much of the energy, spontaneity and enthusiasm that makes them so great on stage.

As far as the sound quality goes, it leaves little to be desired.  The film is shot on Super 8 AND 16mm (contrary to another reviewer's understanding) and may be a bit grainy for some.  For me, it only added to the sense raw power that this Detroit City's power duo showers upon their audience.",1102636800,,526,4.23
2145704,5,B0002YHFZC,"this is a great concert from the white stripes.  The grainy footage doesnt bother me at all....its just an effect that shows the white stripes, the set list is great, but even though they are missing were going to be friends, fell in love with a girl, and a few others, i can live without them for some other great songs",1102550400,,320,4.245901639344262
2145705,5,B0002YHFZC,"I bought this DVD today and watched it three times. I have never ever watched a single dvd three times in one day. I don't even know if I've watched one twice in the same day. I'm not a hardcore white stripes fan, but I definetely liked them enough to pick up this DVD on the day it came out, becuase i've heard a few bootlegs and know they had quite a good live show. Now I'm kicking myself for not going to see them last time they were in town! Seriously, this DVD is only second to the great Led Zeppelin DVD released last year. If you at all consider yourself a fan of the White Stripes, pick up this DVD, these live versions surpass the studio versions in most of the songs.",1102377600,2,679,4.074626865671642
