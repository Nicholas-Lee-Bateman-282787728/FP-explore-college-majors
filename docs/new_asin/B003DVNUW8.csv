8394980,4,B003DVNUW8,"When ordering Problem Child 3 it takes approximately 3 weeks for delivery and it cant be played in regular dvd players... I've been waiting a long time to see the third movie cuz im a huge fan of the first two, however part 3 was quite good i thought. I still think 1&2 are way better. The movie had its funny moments and i found it to be nothing like the first two cuz none of the original actors are in it, except for Jack Warden witch i was rather suprised to see him. I would recommend seeing this if your a fan of the first two Problem Child's and have a interest like i did to see how its concluded. I really enjoyed this movie... Thanks!",1471305600,,644,4.078740157480315

8394984,1,B003DVNUW8,"why was this even made? No John Ritter. No Michael Oliver (Junior). It completely ignores the story line continuing from Problem Child 2. It isn't even funny like the other 2, pointless film with no direction. I can certainly see why this hasn't been released  on dvd  here in the USA. Stick with the first 2. John Ritter was an awesome actor.",1399680000,9,343,4.516129032258065
