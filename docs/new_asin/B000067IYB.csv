8324149,1,B000067IYB,I was so excited when I came across these Treadmoves videos because I had invested in a really good treadmill but was bored with simply walking/jogging on it.  I would say that I was about 60 pounds overweight and was exercising regularly and losing weight when I purchased this video.  I was very discouraged by the rapid tempo and the amount of agility and coordination the video requires to keep up!  It's a shame because it is a great idea but is only geared for those who are already very physically fit.,1190419200,,509,4.510869565217392
8324150,3,B000067IYB,"Wow.  I hope some day to be at the level these people are!  I am a moderate exerciser, not over-weight, and was only able to keep up for the first 5 minutes.  The rest of the time I spent jogging on the treadmill, using the video as inspiration, telling myself that they are working much harder then I am.  Some leg moves I couldn't even attempt without almost falling off.

May not be a good idea if you are uncoordinated, out of shape,  or overweight. Not for the novice!",1127520000,,473,4.258426966292135
8324151,3,B000067IYB,"This is a tough workout that requires a fairly high level of coordination.  You are doing traditional aerobic moves (skips, jumps, etc.) on the moving tread belt.  It's definitely innovative and not easy to do.  I have a low-end treadmill that groaned on some of the moves.  This can't be good for my motor.  If you have a more powerful treadmill, I'd highly recommend this workwout.  If you're looking for a more traditional workout, I'd encourage you to try the speed interval workout by Treadmoves.  It's not available on Amazon, but is directly from the company or Collage Video.  This is probably because it's only on VHS.  This is a tough workout that can be tailored to your fitness level.",1127260800,9,696,4.733333333333333
8324152,5,B000067IYB,"If you are looking for a challenge on your treadmill, this is the excercise program for you.  I read one of it's reviews before I purchased it.  I thought that the individual who worte the review was exaggerating.  To my suprise, she wasn't!  This workout (...)...in a good way though!  I love it.  You work all parts of the body, and towards the end, they even have you do some push-ups, crunches and finish up with stretching.",1093996800,12,428,4.4935064935064934
8324153,4,B000067IYB,"This was a great workout to get over the boredom of the treadmill.  It works all parts of your body, whether you are sprinting, climbing those hills or walking your buns off, you know you are getting a great workout!  It throws in some upper body work and you are set for the day!",1050019200,,280,4.166666666666667
