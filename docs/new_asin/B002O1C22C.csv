Yes (IMHO) when it comes to 'dispatching' a truly odious historical figure like Mr. Stalin.
This DVD explains it all..and I bought it  because the truth needs to be told about the damage and havoc one person can cause a whole country.

 If I were a History teacher, now,I'd use this DVD as a supplement when teaching about communism and it's effect on the world.

BUT, it would be interesting if a school would allow it to be used as a 'supplement' to a Russia unit in a  world history class.",1414454400,,527,4.336734693877551
