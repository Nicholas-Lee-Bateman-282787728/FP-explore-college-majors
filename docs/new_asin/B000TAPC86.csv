Do not waste your time or $$$.",1440633600,,111,4.6
8325732,5,B000TAPC86,"My husband loves this cheap, very low budget movie. He is into dumb movies. I personally hate it. It looks home-made.",1396915200,,117,4.619047619047619
8325733,1,B000TAPC86,"This is independent, true.  But it is CHEAP, like homemade, no budget type of film.  It can be bought with a 50 pack of movies for 16.00 TOTAL.  So why in the hell would someone buy it for 13.00 single?  It ws a really dark movie (as in bad lighting), also bad acting, bad camera work, bad script, poor noise level and NOTHING made sense.  I HATED it.  I wish there was a ZERO.  The only thing good was the cover art.",1201651200,8,417,4.012195121951219
8325734,4,B000TAPC86,"Once again BRAIN DAMAGE bring us that cheesy goodness... The title ? : KILL THEM & EAT THEM, you fool ! The director ? CONALL PENDERGAST. He's the crazy guy who made FLESH FREAKS with his buddies back when he was a student. From what I've heard, He shot it with his cellular phone and used some of his holidays footage to complete it. Actually, he shot some scenes especially for FLESH FREAKS while on holidays in some exotic country ( don't remember wich... ). I've personnaly enjoyed FLESH FREAKS no matter how cheap it was so I was expecting KILL THEM & EAT THEM like mad. Now that I've seen it I can tell you : it's a lot fun, a lot of bloody freaking fun !!

The plot goes like this : some supposed to be dead scientist named DR GORE and his assistant are creating mutants in their hidden lab. They use the mutants to bring more humans to experiment on and feed them with the left overs. One of the mutants looses his hand while killing an homeless teenager. The hand is found and soon some agents from "" the company "" are on DR GORE's tail. Meanwhile, a girl is captured by his team and the doc falls in love with her. His assistant has other plans and soon all hell breaks loose !! I'm talking about mad fights : agents vs mutants, mutants vs mutants !!

First of all, be aware that KILL THEM & EAT THEM is a comedy. A twisted, sort of weird comedy for nerds like us but a comedy none the less. The characters deliver a lot of funny lines but not only that : some scenes are completely absurd like the one where DR GORE talks about his philosophy and his ambitions in a very thoughtful manner to the goofiest looking mutant of the bunch. Better yet, while devasting the lab, one character shows a kid's microscope to the camera saying "" look at what we are reduced to work with !! "" . Now that's funny but you also got a lot of big headed mutants who are really cheesy but extremely cool like the goblins in CLAUDIO FRAGASSO's TROLL 2 or the SERGIO MARTINO's FISHMEN. There's also is a lot of cheesy gore and some melting but don't forget the fights. They're awesome, so naive, harmless and entertaining. They got me thinking about X.OR THE SPACE SHERIF man.
On the technical side, it has to said that PENDERGAST has improved himself ( the fact that he used a real video camera this time has probably helped though ), the editing is on point and so is the photography. The actors ? Well, those who know how to act, overact, and those who don't know, do their best. Meaning it's ok since we're not watching TAXI DRIVER here.

Overall, KILL THEM & EAT THEM is recommended to all the no-budget lovers and damn... I just love those cheesy looking big headed mutants man !!",1200355200,3,2675,4.282608695652174
