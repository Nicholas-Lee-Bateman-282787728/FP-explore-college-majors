He is a wonderful teacher and he explains all of the information in great detail. I wish that when I was in school that teachers had explained this information the way that he does.",1356998400,,370,4.225352112676056
8554925,5,B00ANV61HW,"This is a full course on value investing. It is awesome how you can see Mariusz show you on his computer screen how he finds investment ideas, how he values companies, and where he get his information from. People pay a lot of money to learn how to invest and this DVD collection is only $35 per DVD. I am very impressed with the quality of this educational DVD set. I would definitely recommend it.",1355702400,,399,4.333333333333333
8554926,5,B00ANV61HW,"I have read both books by Mariusz Skonieczny and the one thing that he does best is explain hard concepts. The Value Investing DVD Collection is pretty impressive. There is nothing like it out there. In a video format, he teaches about value investing by covering many different topics such as due diligence, finding investment ideas, accounting, valuing companies, and using financial ratios. These DVDs are packed with information and most of them are more than one hour long. So between the 10 DVDs you have more than 10 hours of information.

I think that if someone already knows a lot about investing but is weak in a specific area, it would be more efficient to buy the DVD related to that area.  However, after purchasing and watching the whole program, I realized something: If someone is relatively new to investing, buying only 1 or 2 of the DVD's may do more harm than good.  For example, I wouldn't be comfortable finding a good potential stock idea, without having the tools to evaluate that idea for myself.  How else would I distinguish a true true undervalued gem from a company that some shady character is trying to pump up online or on TV?",1355443200,2,1159,4.694581280788177
