2604113,3,B000GB5M06,"The Feeding is the greatest example of Low quality special effects and sometimes silliness and blury effects. The sad reality is that when a director and producers decide to make what they think is a good werewolf movie, it seem to me they just get further and further away from the werewolf transformations. When Rick Baker and Rob Bottin did there werewolf movie,An American Werewolf In London and The Howling,they did not have alot of money,and of course the 2 movies we're low budget films way back in 1980. The big differents between the 2 werewolf movies and The Feeding is that these we're low budget films and the special effects we're completely excellent. The Feeding is a low budget film and there is not one werewolf transformation effects at all in the film, not even any optical effects. But I will give the director of the film a little credit who also worte the film as well. The writing was different and kinda unique and really a surprise to me.",1235088000,,963,4.637426900584796
2604114,3,B000GB5M06,"This is your typical horror flick.  It wasn't bad, but I wouldnt

2604115,1,B000GB5M06,"Anyone expecting a gem from a movie with average cover art at best and a basic premise described on the back get what they deserve from this ""movie?"". However it does incure a lot of backlash for good reason, or a few of them actually.

  Might be some possible spoilers (hehe, like it matters).

1. The werewolf is shot with what seems like cheese cloth over the lense, which causes some blurry effect of sorts. Not that this is a bad thing, given that when we see the werewolf it looks, well fairly ludicrious would be saying too little. Apparently, Tood Gilpin the Editor and Director of Photography must've realized the monster looked silly too and used the blur effect to cover it up and edit a lot of the scenes with the wolf to make it seem less silly, sadly these efforts were futile.

2. The story wasn't too bad actually just basic, a creature is killing off all the wildlife in a forrested area and only a special agent (Robert Pralgo) and a park ranger (Kara Maria Amedon, in her first role) can save a bunch of campers and stop the creature.

3. The dialogue (written by director Paul Moore ""Dark Harvest"") on the other hand was pretty silly and the lack of any experienced actors didn't help, heck half of the campers were in their debuts, the people who played Ty, Alan and Elizabeth were each in one film before this.

4. The acting itself is really bad, by all involved. There isn't really anyone good, though as bad as it is, I must say I've seen worse acting in other flicks (The Car, actually comes to mind, in fact that might have been a worse movie).

5. The film itself is a pretty big mess, from the opening scene, to the intros of the special agent, rangers and the 20 something campers. Then the oddly placed sex scenes that can be heard but not seen, to the obligatory nudity by the four female campers. Though I must give the director credit for using girls that looked like actual girls you could see almost anywhere, rather than skinny supermodel chicks. That didn't make the nudity good though.

  Then the campers start getting off'd in blurry and badly edited fashion, the agent goes after the creature, gets killed, then the ranger must band the survivors together and fight off the wolf or die trying, (though the trying isn't very hard).

  I knew by the ending there was plans for a sequel, but I sure hope not. Unless that is, the cast is given a major overhaul and the budget is given something, anything more than what it had for this one. Bad all around, avoid, unless you need a laugh that is and if you do, just rent ""The Beast of Bray Road"" at least that one is shot good, or at least better than this. 0/10.",1168300800,11,2652,4.396728016359918
2604116,1,B000GB5M06,"I am a die hard Werewolf movie fan.  Trust me I have some Werewolf DVD's in my collection that MOST True horror and werewolf movie \ DVD buffs would consider ripe stinkers and LOVING IT!  yYES I am proud to own most lesser quality Werewolf themed DVD's because they give me something to laugh at during the sad times. I even sank to buying ""Wolves of Wall Street (2002) on DVD"" and it was impossible for me to imagine a supposed werewolf movie lamer than that,.... until NOW!

The Feeding breaks new ground in lame werewolf movies. The cardboard acting, the incredibly bad lighting, the predictable implausable plot what little their was of it. Inadequate character development, unlikable innane characters doing things for the dumbest reasons making no sense whatsoever.  All topped off by the cheapest looking werewolf costume ever.  The Werewolf had a look that strongly suggested it started life at the bottom of a dollar bin at some no name second hand value store.

The saddest thing about The Feeding is bad as everything is, the DVD is in no ways funny AT ALL!  The Feeding takes itself way too seriously as legitimate horror.  The POOR POOR actors in this tripe don't even look as if they are having one bit of fun at any point in the whole movie.  The actors in the Feeding are more deserving of your pity and not your scorn because the best actors in the world could not revive breathe live into ""The Feeding"" DVD featuring a Werewolf that was Brain Dead On Arrival.  Actor's in the movie acts like a bunch of Norma Desmond want-to-be knock off's all fighting for the highly prized dimly lit out of focus close up.  The camera work and special effects look like things unworthy of a high school drama class.  There is more to be frightened of in a carton of stale milk then exists in the entire running time of The Feeding.

The final insult is the price of The Feeding at $23.99 dollars at the time of this writing.  I strongly suspect the sanity of those who brought us The Feeding for even daring to think anyone would pay $23.99 for this dark fuzzy focused unprofessional ill-concieved mess.  If the Feeding were value priced at $9.99 it would still be way over priced.  At $9.99 however I might have still brought a copy of the Feeding just to add it to my growing collection of really really bad Z quality Werewolf DVD's. Unfortunately there must be a limit even to my DVD buying excesses.

Pricing a really bad Werewolf DVD at $23.99 and expecting anyone to buy it is an insult to any sane customers intelligence.  Bad as the Feeding is I will surely find a copy in the dollar bin of some value store very soon.  Who knows if I am really lucky that raggity moth eaten flea bag Werewolf costume they used in The Feeding DVD will be in the same bargain bin too so I can enjoy both as a buy any two items for one dollar sale.

All jokes aside folks I ask that you please don't buy The Feeding at $23.99 since it is NOT good and is WAY Overpriced junk.  I too love any Werewolf themed DVD's but buying this mess rewards production companies for the very worse production values at prices that seek to make fools of customers.

I have paid and will gladly pay $23.99 and more when the production values or subject matter covered prove worthy of the price but rest assured there is no way in all creation The Feeding is worth its $23.99 asking price.  The Feeding is actually worth $7.99 tops and thats me being extremely generous.",1167955200,20,3443,4.464856230031949
2604117,1,B000GB5M06,"This movie sucks.  Of course the ending left the possibility for a sequel.  Here is my plea to the creators of this movie, ""Please for the love of God do not make another one of these titanic turd bombs!""

2604118,1,B000GB5M06,"because I couldn't wait for it to be over! Horrible acting, I mean every character was 1 dimensional and had no emotion whatsoever. The movie reminded me of Pumpkinhead but much much worse. The only reason I gave this movie a chance was because Lions Gate had it's Brand on it and I love Lions Gate flicks (most of em). The lead actress (the park Ranger or whatever lady) was just horrible. Her lines were so f'n cheesy and she delivered them even cheesier that it was unbearable to listen to her. I hope she never ""acts"" again. If this movie comes on tv, give it a shot but it's time you will never get back!!",1157932800,2,610,4.267241379310345

2604120,2,B000GB5M06,"Hi, I caught this film the other night on the Sci-fi channel.

Not really the worst monster movie I have ever seen, but what shocked me were it's similarites to another low budget monster in the woods movie called ""The Haw Ridge Devil"" made in 2003. Even the monsters, in the case of ""The Feeding"" a giant werewolf, looked alot alike. Of course after a while all these monster on the loose movies begin to look the same. Still compared to other movies on the Sci-fi Channel it was more entertaining than most.",1152662400,,509,4.473118279569892

2604128,3,B000GB5M06,"Viewers accustomed to state of the art effects--or even mediocre CGI like the SyFy channel--may find The Feeding too low-tech. This is definitely a very low-budget production, and this is apparent in everything from the camera-work to the werewolf to even the acting. All the same, if you can use your imagination to compensate a little, ""The Feeding"" is actually a very enjoyable werewolf film. The Appalachian forest setting is pretty well utilized, and the direction does take advantage of the deep woodlands our story unfolds within to good effect. The cast doesn't feature any ""name"" performers or even any genre stalwarts, but for the most part everyone does a decent job and a couple of the actors acquit themselves really well even though the budget probably forced them to get by with a lot of one-take shots without the benefit of much editing. The script is admittedly uneven, with certain scenes that stand out as quite well written including some witty dialog, but others that are almost entirely nonsensical and which made this reviewer roll his eyes and groan inwardly. But the biggest obstacle for many fans may be the look of the werewolf. The director apparently realized this going in, and every time the beast appears on camera it gets the soft-focus treatment so that you never, ever get a good look at it. This didn't bother me very much...in fact, the weird soft-focus tactic actually added to the nightmarish atmosphere of the monstrous attacks. The action is decent and has a realistic bent, and the climax is pretty suspenseful as well. Overall I enjoyed The Feeding, warts and all. The moderately clever plot, surprisingly solid performances, good atmosphere and believable action all make up for the insignificant shooting budget and some other problems that go along with a lack of funds. If The Feeding won't be remembered as a horror classic, it's certainly nowhere to be found amongst the worst werewolf films, either. Viewers who can forgive the relatively minor flaws may find The Feeding to be a surprisingly fun b-movie experience.",1438041600,2,2067,4.994202898550725

It was filmed in Virginia and North Carolina on or near the Blue Ridge Parkway so I loved the fact that I was seeing the area where I grew up, although I don't remember any Man-eating Possums. ( the werewolf did look slightly possum-ish )  Still I liked this film, and as one other has said I am sucker for werewolf movies, this would not be on the bottom of the list of werewolf movies I have seen and have collected.

2604138,3,B000GB5M06,"This is a great example of everyone in the movie doing their very best to make a good movie on a severely limited budget. Everyone deserves credit for giving their roles their best, and some of the cast really can carry the weight. Yes, the plot, as it is, is a hodge-podge of other movies, yes, we have seen it all before and can even recite the next line of dialogue two or three times along the way. But these guys put their heart in it and give it a real effort before being eaten, dismembered or lost in the wood to face their fate. There are a load of plot holes, situation and makeup inconsistancies that will distract you at times. Overall, the wolf effects are done fairly well for having no budget. One glaring note, frequently seen in the budget genre, is the speed at which the animal can move in some frames and how painfully slow he is in the next, while the cast just waits cemented in place for the effect to finish. All the elements are here - the loner/hero that knows he's had a bad idea, and pays for it. The smarty almost romantic interest that just doesn't fit the typical, but rises to the occasion. The fun-loving tribe of youngsters entering a danger zone while on a roadtrip showcasing relationships, growth pains, bathing in a river, and how to survive a living nightmare - or not. Some cast members are lost too soon, one very unexpectedly and without enough impact, some stay with questions of why they're the ones that survive. The showdown is typically improbable, the result is expected, and the closing frames are a good nod to the style of movie. All told, the movie is fun and that's why you watch these, isn't it?",1405728000,5,1649,4.427631578947368

I caught myself LOL MORE than a few times (along with some eye rolling moments), but all in all, I thought it was a pretty hilarious, low budget take of a creature feature.

In addition, I'd think it was a refreshing change of pace that the nudity displayed REAL girls, bearing their REAL breasts (not to mention ALL of the campers and women in the film, excluding the female ranger), and unlike one reviewers adverse opinion, I thought the girls were all cute and attractive.

 At first, it annoyed me how incapable the two ""professional"" wildlife hunter, and ""whisperer"" were handling themselves, but after about the 3rd flub up, I realized it was more of a two stooges type of effort, so by the end, when she shoots the dude rather than the werewolf (for the SECOND time, ha-ha) and the ameture camper girl saves the day with her Hunger Games stance and perfect shot, I was laughing my head off. Come on now... NOBODY trips and falls as much as these characters, while seriously trying to escape a bloodthirsty predator, (especially over their dead boyfriend's leg).
