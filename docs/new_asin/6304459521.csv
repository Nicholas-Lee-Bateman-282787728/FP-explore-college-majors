Everything she explained in each step, she then applied with her dogs so you could see the steps in action and how to apply them to your situation. Other videos just talked about the problem but had no method of resolving the issue. ""Dog Father"" from on T.V. is a waste of money. This tape is very useful.",1358121600,,414,4.1875
7871455,1,6304459521,"I totally agree with the reviewer who opposes the use of choke chains.  Any trainer who still advocates this method is way behind the times.  For that reason alone, I would not buy this video.",1145318400,,192,4.457142857142857
7871456,4,6304459521,This was an excellent video for first time dog owners and trainers.  The directions are clear and the contect is clear. Great job!,1127088000,,130,4.6521739130434785
7871457,3,6304459521,"I found this video very informative.  However, the corrections done using the choke chains are misleading.  She only uses large dogs with lots of fur.  No where in the video does she suggest how to properly use a choke chain on small breed dogs.  Judging by the way the ""pop-and-release"" method was used on these large dogs, serious damage would be done to a small breed dog.  Other lessons, however, not using the choke chain were a good source of information.  I will definitely use this video as a refresher of how to train.",1056672000,,527,4.553191489361702
7871458,4,6304459521,"This is a step-by-step guide on how to train your dog.  The video is well put together and easy to follow.  You should have no problem teaching your dog each behavior, because the material is presented in a straightforward fashion.
Commands and rewards are explained from the dogs point of view, so there's no guesswork about what should or should not work.  Each command is explained and shown, in sequence; this means you can master a command before moving on to the next section of the video.
I highly recommend this dog training video to anyone who wants to train a dog.  This video should be good for first time dog trainers, and also people who have trained dogs before, and want a few new pointers.  We all have something to learn.

7871459,5,6304459521,"I have seen 3 or 4 different dog training videos.  April Frost is the first that shows clearly that any dog owner can learn the techniques to train their dog to sit, stay, come, heel, wait, don't jump, etc, within  minutes.  April Frost does not waste the viewer's time.",914371200,,270,4.469387755102041
