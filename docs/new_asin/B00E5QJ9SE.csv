5891723,3,B00E5QJ9SE,"For Americans, who are intimately familiar with the Western genre, seeing an Italian opera in this California Gold Rush setting requires getting over a bit of cognitive dissonance. But it's worth it with ""La Fanciulla Del West,"" because Puccini has lavished great care and love on this lush score (reportedly among his favorites), one that reflects his ability to incorporate harmonic advances, in this instance partly from Debussy.

Unfortunately, in the case of the Royal Swedish Opera production captured here, the conductor doesn't fully plumb the depths of the score. He just moves things along, getting from point to point. There's no evident joy in it and subtleties are lost. It casts a pall over this performance, because of all of Puccini's operas this is the one where the vocal line is most integrated with the orchestra.

But what about the Minnie? In the end, the opera succeeds or fails mainly on how well the soprano takes on what is arguably Puccini's most difficult role vocally next to Turandot. Here, Nina Stemme gives it a shot (so to speak), but she's only moderately successful. In Act 1, she displays a matronly sound with a pronounced vibrato, which is not a good fit for the Girl of the Golden West who is supposed to be so irresistible to all the locals. That quality is less noticeable in the subsequent two acts, by which time her voice has warmed up. She certainly tries very hard throughout and manages the high notes (and even some lovely soft ones), but it's a rather humorless, generalized portrayal.

It also doesn't help dramatically that Minnie's suitors look so much younger than she (high definition video is unforgiving). But it's in the male contingent where we find the strengths of this production.

John Lundgren is a realistically nasty, very threatening Jack Rance. There's no mustache twirling from this baritone. His sound is somewhat dry but solid. Because of his more urban air, never before has Rance seemed more like the Scarpia of the West. The pivotal Act 2, in fact, becomes reminiscent of the ""Tosca"" second act the way it's played here. Once again, it's a soprano whose virtue is at stake as she bargains for her man with a villain who's overtly lusting after her.

Aleksandrs Antonenko is Dick Johnson/Ramerrez, Minnie's love interest. Although he's not highly emotive facially or physically, there's plenty of emotion in his beautiful tenor voice. His is the most Italianate performance (although he's Latvian), and it comes as a breath of fresh air to hear his voice riding smoothly over the beautiful Puccini melodies. The role's high notes hold no peril for him.

The staging of this production is half-baked. I don't mind the modern minimalist set used in Act 1 for the saloon, but it doesn't work as well for the events of Act 3, where the director's lack of inspiration becomes evident. In contrast, for no apparent reason Act 2 is given a realistically rustic setting. Then there are the random projections on the walls of what's happening on stage -- they're supposed to remind us of movie Westerns, but end up only distracting the viewer.

Technically, there's little to fault in this Blu-ray, which I received a review copy of. The DTS 5.1 sound and picture quality are excellent. The other ""Fanciullas"" on Blu-ray (I count three at this point) appear to have their own pluses and minuses. Looks like a fully satisfying Blu-ray version of this opera has yet to gallop into view.",1379203200,13,3447,4.8720136518771335
5891724,5,B00E5QJ9SE,"Puccini's down-to-earth realism and slice-of-life atmospheric scenarios are tailor made for the cinema. The big screen's embracing of larger-than-life passions and emotions fits Puccini's operas like a smooth, gorgeous, Italian glove. Some of the best Puccini operas on DVD indeed are films, not stage performances: Tosca (Domingo/Malfitano and Gheorghiu/Alagna), Madame Butterfly (Huang, Troxell) and La Boheme (Netrebko/Villazon). Although Christof Loy has made his mark as an opera director far more as a minimalist and modernist than an emotional sentimentalist, here he is beautifully, shamelessly echoing the golden era of film and TV Westerns in this touching 2012 Swedish Opera performance of Puccini's underappreciated La Fanciulla Del West (The Girl of the Golden West). Puccini's take on the California Gold Rush of the mid-19th century is perhaps the first Spaghetti Western. Sergio Leone later became famous in the 1960s with his Italian cowboy films, ""Fistful of Dollars,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and others. It seems the fervent Italian nature is sympatico with the bold world of the Western.

Loy has magnificently put the worlds of stage opera and film together here to stunning effect. The brief overture is treated to an ultra-wide, black and white, 1950ish movie reenactment on screen of a stunning western scene of wide-open vistas and gorgeous sky, with a lone woman riding her horse, as the credits roll. She gets off, starts running toward the front of the screen and suddenly there comes Nina Stemme bursting through the curtain onto the opera stage in full color, guns ablazing, as the ""Polka"" saloon keeper Minnie. Fabulous! You can see excerpts of it on youtube. From there, Loy tones down his tendency to spareness and modernity, and gives Fanciulla an evocative, eloquent reading. In a  notable innovation, Loy continues with his Western movie nostalgia bent. In several scenes, the back wall of the Polka displays a fairly big-screen, black and white film rendition of notable scenes taking place on stage. Even in old fashioned, less than terribly sharp black and white (both adding authenticity), with vertical wooden slats slightly obstructing the view, I could not take my eyes off these filmic scenes. As they used to say in the ""Lone Ranger"" TV show, welcome back to ""those thrilling days of yesteryear."" The iconic legend of the Western lives on. Wonderful!

Of course, opera is more than that, terrific as it is. Vocally, the cast is outstanding. Stemme brings her superb dramatic soprano in a wistful, mesmerizing portrayal of the tough yet sensitive bar owner everyone loves. She may look a little long in the tooth, but Stemme dominates the stage in a winning and authoritative manner. Swedish baritone John Lundgren's Sheriff Jack Rance is somewhat understated but firm and dark in a convincing portrayal of the opera's heavy, and a joy to listen to. Latvian tenor Alexsandrs Antonenko is vocally resplendent but there is still room for him to grow in his portrayal of Ramirez/Johnson. His first scenic entry is less than dramatic (see a commanding Domingo here) although Loy or the filmmakers could have done more to help him. There are elements of the drama, anger and romance in the role he has yet to plumb, although Antonenko still comes across positively. He just needs some more seasoning, more oomph. Watch Domingo in any of his three DVDs or Fabio Armiliato, who may not quite have the voice of Antonenko but puts his all into the role (2005 Puccini Festival on DVD). The fine Swedish orchestra is led by Pier Giorgio Morandi, who displays authority, passion and flexibility in his reading.

Scenically, Loy offers a spare but genuine looking Polka saloon (for the full-blown Western treatment, check out the superb 1983 Covent Garden Domingo/Neblett performance or either Met DVD: 1992 with Domingo/Daniels or 2010 with Voigt/Giordano). Loy's cowboys and mine workers may have a bit too much of an airbrushed look facially (blu-ray reveals all), but they are costumed superbly and act like they are straight out of Dodge (or the Gold Rush). Loy is less interventionist than usual. The first two acts take place in the Polka and Minnie's house (the latter simply designed, with some charming old-fashioned wallpaper, a cross on the wall and other nostalgic touches) basically like Puccini intended. Loy moves act three from the forest outside town back to the Polka. Here Minnie is hidden away from the miners and Rance in the next room, listening in as they decide the fate of her lover, the scofflaw Ramirez/Dick Johnson. This brings an added insight and poignancy to the scene with Minnie knowing what is in store for him.

A fine performance then of an opera that unfortunately still needs championing. There are still doubters and it is not performed that often. True, Fanciulla does not have the famous, heart-stopping arias of Butterfly, Tosca, Boheme or even Gianni Schicchi. But it has wonderful melody throughout, heightened and advanced harmonies, a strong sense of drama Puccini was known for, a distinctive ending and some touching pathos; when Minnie and Johnson talk about ""what might have been"" at the end of act one, the heart bleeds. Admittedly, the first time I saw Fanciulla I thought - an operatic Spaghetti western, this just doesn't sound right. But after subsequent viewings, I came to see its abundant virtues and grew to love it. So it doesn't sound like a prototypical Western and it's in Italian. It's Puccini. Do the Japanese think less of Butterfly because it may not sound like Japanese music? Do the Chinese with Turandot or the French with Boheme? So why not an Italian opera about the California Gold Rush? If Sergio Leone can convince with Spaghetti Westerns, why not Puccini? Especially Puccini. Fanciulla has glorious music, colorful characters and a fine story with dramatic tension. Give this blu-ray, the Domingo Covent Garden or Armiliato/Dessi DVDs a viewing. They're all excellent.",1378684800,21,5985,5.1092951991828395

5891728,4,B00E5QJ9SE,"FANCIULLA doesn't get much respect in the opera world.  Many seem to think the subject matter is not worthy of Puccini's soaring melodies, or they can't imagine real cowboys singing such music.  Whatever the initial impression, there is much beautiful music and a sweet love story that propels this opera.  The present production also boasts the current reigning tenor in the operatic world, Jonas Kaufmann, and the reigning dramatic soprano in that world, namely, Nina Stemme. Stemme is currently wowing New York audiences with Electra and will open the Met's next season as Isolde. This production is from the Wiener Staatsoper, with Franz Welser-Most conducting.  Musically, there in much to admire here, as one would expect from such an august organization.  The orchestra sounds wonderful and Welser-Most keeps the opera flowing.  Kaufmann is an attractive and intelligent artist, but this is hardly his best work.  His voice tends to thin out at the top of his range and the low voice is hollow and throaty.  Stemme certainly has the notes--the part of Minnie has some high flying and soaring passages that can tax any soprano.  Stemme does not sustain a legato line when she sings the high passages.  Just before she sings a climactic high note, she breaks the legato line by pausing and then does a little lunge to the high note.  Still, I could not help liking the Minnie and Johnson characters as they went through the drama.  The Sheriff, played by Tomasz Konieczny, had a narrow range of emotions that were only on the extreme: they ranged from desperate to murderous.  The final scene, in which Johnson is nearly hanged for being a bandit, was touching until the director, Marco Arturo Marelli, added he ludicrous touch of having Minnie and Johnson escape in a balloon instead of on horses (horses--they lived in the old West, after all). FANCIULLA deserves a wider hearing.  This is a fair and decent presentation of it.",1461888000,3,1934,4.929012345679013
5891729,4,B00E5QJ9SE,"Kaufmann's artistry and singing are stupendous, and Stemme is convincing once the voice is warmed up.  Welser-Most and the Vienna State Opera orchestra serve the cause brilliantly, but the sets are on the grim side.",1461888000,,215,5.142857142857143

far as the main characters are concerned, I had a problem.  Konieczny as Rance was an excellent.  The only thing missing was a snaky mustache. Fanciulla rests on the soprano.  To me Stemme's voice was always hard sounding even when she was singing softly. Kaufmann had only two real arias which performed beautifully.  Also, he looked like avery rugged cowboy and especially handsome.  The only problem I had was that it looked like he was making love to someones mother.  Stemme is not, in my view, young enough looking to handle the role and her red wig did not help.  The orchestra gave Puccini an excellent reading.",1458604800,2,720,4.696

I prefer Kaufmann to Antanenko but still feel the best performance of this opera on disc is the Met production with Domingo, Daniels and Milnes.  Stemme hit all the notes with some difficulty and I didn't feel her characterization of Miinnie in this performance.  Ka ufmann is the absolute star here with a beautifully sung performance as one would expect - he never disappoints!  The production was terrible - no period evident just a conglomeration of junk so I ignored it.  Rance looked like a Nazi in search of another play although his voice was acceptable.  I thought the sound in the first act was very poor until Kaufmann came on the scene and he saved the Act I.  It occurred to me that Vienna needs to call the Met and find out what kind of body mics they are using and get some.  The orchestra was grand, however which went a long way in supporting the performances.  This disc is worth having just for Kaufmann if for nothing else.  He is terrific in this role!

5891741,2,B00E5QJ9SE,"I love this opera, honestly. What is not to  like when you have Puccini and, surprise, surprise, a happy ending? So when the news of a new production with Stemme and Kaufmann appeared I said: Bravo!

La fanciulla is a beautiful opera. It has beautiful melodies, a nice orchestration and that ""it"" more, which makes it a great opera. I do not know why is not more popular and why is not on stage every season. But ahim! I guess that when the soprano  does not die many feel it is not  a real opera.

So there I  was with my dvd and sole possesion of the remote control. And then Welser-Mst starts. Ok, I  like my Puccini high, but not loud. But I can forgive that because maybe the opera will be full of energy and power. Just like I like it.

First problem, the settings. What is with this new trend of putting a couple of neon signs and thinking it gives sense to the opera? No, it does not. It is a cold one. Maybe I am too classic, it can be, but well, I can live with that.  So now let's wait for Jack....and Jack appears. And it hurts. A lot. Tomasz Konieczny cannot say one word correctly. Why, oh why? He has the looks, the voice but , honestly in what language is he singing? I am not asking for a perfect Italian pronunciation, but getting right one word out of ten would be great. This is looking bad. But Nina Stemme is here. There is still hope.
Meanwhile the boys are doing it greatly. I like them. And finally: our Minnie. The toughest girl in California.
Not bad, I mean, not perfect but she commands, she commands everybody, even the orchestra. She moves a lot but I can forget  it. Now we only need the guy from Sacramento.
I confess that I  was waiting for Kaufmann, because I liked his Cavaradossi with Gheorghiu and his Don Jose was not bad either. But, yep, but again, I need that little extra, Jonas!
First act is gone....thank God! But I am not worried because the real stuff is in the second. And it starts fine. Nina is great (Hallelujah!) more than great, now she is in, completely and absolutely. So when Jonas appears I am a little happier, and though it takes a while to get that  chemistry , finally, they make it. Good, I  am a happy girl now. Nina is funny, I  would have loved a couple of  sentences said and not sung but I am a pernickety gal. Il baccio comes and goes. The snow comes and goes and yep....Jack is here again. And no, he is not better. Really, why  this torment? Jack, please, say one word right, just one! But nope, tonight is not the night. Nina wins at  poker and at  opera. She is good, very good and she ends with a victory. Her tre re e un paio is like slapping Jack (and I  think he deserves it)
By the third act we all know our cards so I  wait patienly for Jack saying what he has to say (and he says a lot) so  Ramirez could sing. Nice aria, nice voice but he is left a little behind. True he is not Domingo or Pavarotti, but a little more would have been welcomed. Fortunately Minnie appears and save the day, Dick and the opera. Ok, fine. they will miss California, and we will not miss Jack.

It is a decent production, but it is just good. With a big just and a small good. I was hoping for more chemistry between Jonas and Nina, but maybe it was not the night.
The change in the settings, with some kind of middle west town in the 50's was not a good idea. And of course the bad guy had to wear black leather (what a novelty!).
The orchestra, fine, brilliant sometimes but too loud in some moments. And then is Jack....we better forget Jack. Let's remember him singing Strauss.
And I am not going to  mention the balloon....because, well,  it's a balloon! It is the classic me again speaking but, honestly, a balloon?!
So two stars. I know, I  am a tough girl but this is  a western and tough girls are required.",1444953600,13,3776,4.180939226519337
5891742,5,B00E5QJ9SE,"I loved everything about this. Anyone who likes opera will love it. As it happens I have never seen this opera and it rewarded me with surprises.

........................................................................

This recording, made in February 2012 in Stockholm, presents one of Puccini's rarest major operas and one which Puccini himself rated highly. However, after initial successes the popularity of the opera has declined so it is a pleasure to welcome this particularly successful recording.

The quality of the actual recording is excellent across the board with sharp imaging giving good rendition of colours even when the lighting is subdued. The sound is equally excellent and is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. Thankfully radio mikes with their inherently false sound effects are not used in this production and all the singing is delivered naturally and this is an enormous advantage and enhances the sonic effect of the recording considerably.

The production places the action believably in the period of an American gold-rush camp as Puccini intended and the costuming is consistent with an early Hollywood western of the period. This cinematic connection is further established with the use of sepia toned filmed close-ups of the interaction between main characters at intervals mostly projected against the groove and tongued saloon walls of the main setting. This seems totally acceptable as a device and has the advantage of further establishing the apparent vintage of the setting through the use of sepia imaging and by giving the audience a slightly different viewing angle of the action on stage. This combination of an essentially traditionalist staging with use of cinematic elements applied in a restrained manner reflects Puccini's own interests in pushing the boundaries of his dramatic operas to create realism on stage.

The singing and acting of all those on stage is of a uniformly high standard and overcomes some of the stilted libretto. The universal greeting of 'Hello' for example, is unlikely in any context of a rough mining camp and 'Hija', 'Hi-there' etc. would surely be be more believable. The Indian's use of 'ugh' as a communication also seems due for a re-think.

In more detail, Nina Stemme delivers a strong and dramatic rendering of the role of Minnie. She is a powerful singer and also acts well. Her role within the story is thus credible and impressive. John Lundgren makes for an unpleasantly driven and self-regarding sheriff and one can readily understand why his attractions as a lover for Minnie are so limited. Once more, the singing and acting of this role are both excellent even though the booklet's description of John Lundgren as charismatic takes some swallowing and runs counter to his character role in the opera. More believable as having 'charisma' is Aleksandrs Antonenko who, as Dick Johnson the bandit, makes an acceptable account of his role of renewing his feeling for Minnie and thus turning from a life of crime. He possesses an excellent voice of considerable power and accuracy and is thus able to match Nina Stemme very well both vocally and dramatically. The supporting minor roles from within the rest of the cast are all delivered with the same level of commitment and quality both in terms of singing and acting.

The important role of the conductor and the hard working orchestra cannot be overstated in this production. Their input is simply colossal and not a single chance to emphasise the tensions within the music is lost. Particular climatic moments such as Minnie and Rance's gambling card game for the life of Johnson in act 2 are played for tremendous effect, but their contribution goes much further than isolated moments of effect. It underpins the whole production to an unusual degree.

This is an opera about the redeeming nature of love and the supporting role of forgiveness. It is set in a particularly raw secular situation and, being so set, it becomes a powerful conception. There is a lack of the 'big tune' but, seen and experienced here, there is certainly no lack of lyric and dramatic impact or of climatic moments of great power. This is a very successful presentation of this, often underrated opera.

I would suggest that this production is a powerful delivery of a surprisingly powerful opera and as such, may well revise purchasers' opinions of its relative worth. It is certainly worth seriously considering as a purchase and is more than capable of holding its own against competing alternatives.

If you'd like to see a production not only performed well, but also competently stage-managed and recorded, pick up the Daniels/Domingo/Slatkin DVD also available here on Amazon. It's from 1992 and more than twenty years older, but the director and the engineers on that issue what knew what they were doing: it's vastly more sophisticated and engaging video than this high-def muddle.",1471737600,3,933,5.35374149659864
