3785408,4,B001SER4LA,"Frisky Dingo season 1&2 is by far the most entertainment per dollar that you can spend on quality Adult Swim DVD's.
This is an underground comedy that rivals Aqua Teen Hunger Force. I whole heartedly believe that this is a much better show than Archer (the spin-off of Frisky Dingo).

You won't regret watching this show over and over and at 11 minutes an episode its easy to watch half a season in one sitting. Great stuff.

Okay, I'm done!",1291075200,,441,4.5
3785409,4,B001SER4LA,"excellent show, but not quite as funny if you watch them all back-to-back-to-back.  One of my DVDs also was ""floating"" in the box and arrived scratched.  there is one episode we cannot watch because the dvd player skips.  :(",1288656000,,224,4.6923076923076925
3785410,5,B001SER4LA,Next to Arrested Development this is one of my favorite shows! Absolutely hilarious. Season one encasing was cracked though. Luckily I have back up DVD cases!,1288569600,,158,5.115384615384615
3785411,1,B001SER4LA,"I love this show. The animation is incredibly limited but detailed at the same time and the humor is awesome.

But this two dvd deal? Pointless. Put bluntly, season 1 and 2 are 12.50 seperately. Which means if you buy both it'll cost only 25.00. I'm not sure where this 12-13 dollar price increase came from, but it's a terrible deal compared to just buying both of them seperately. Normally I'm not a stickler about these kind of things, but the price difference is just too large to ignore considering it's just two dvds.",1269907200,26,523,4.5638297872340425
3785412,5,B001SER4LA,"I have seen many animated comedy serials, but Frisky Dingo is the first and only one that actually makes me laugh out loud during and especially at the end of every episode. The writing and acting is truely brilliant! Yes, some of the jokes are low humor (that's to be expected), but on the whole, it is creative, has subtile running jokes, and cerebral ways of making me laugh, not just slap-stick.

Also, how did Frisky Dingo manage to take a scary, albino, skeleton-headed, talon-footed huge guy and make him their protagonist? His accent helps to soften his persona, as does his unswerving (if dysfunctional) love for his son. But, wow! ""Killface"" is the guy you ROOT for? It's crazy!

The other most brilliant thing the writers did is the name itself ""Frisky Dingo."" It isn't until well into season 2 that the words ""frisky dingo"" are even spoken! How cool is that! When it arrived at the house, my husband said, ""It's called what? Why?"" And it's all so hillarious! I get it! Boosh.

My final recommendation is BUY IT! BUY BOTH SEASONS! You'll absolutely love them if you have a brain in your head and a funny bone (and they're connected!). Enjoy! I sure do! I think I'll watch the series again right now!",1268092800,,1210,4.592592592592593
3785413,4,B001SER4LA,"Hysterical send-up of the alter-ego crime fighter.  In this take, incredibly shallow Xander Crews heads a large corporation, but also leads a crime fighting group known as the 'Xtacles'.  Intergalactic evil menace Killface comes on the scene, and an epic battle ensues... eventually for President of the United States.  Wonderfully absurd, with great subplots interwoven throughout the 2 seasons.  Very clever in some ways, while throwing in some crass humor, too, it's a fun romp through current events in a way you've never seen before. You'll find yourself saying ""Boosh!"" by the end.",1262476800,4,587,5.279569892473118
3785414,4,B001SER4LA,"I wasn't a huge fan of Sealab but this show is exceptionally funny. It's one of the most intelligent and clever shows to come out of the Adult Swim brand (especially the 2nd season.) Any fan of dry, ridiculous humor or many adult swim shows will likely find this show refreshingly hilarious.",1242259200,7,291,4.615384615384615

3785418,5,B001SER4LA,This was acually a really good show but I never could understand it when it was on TV.,1406332800,,86,3.8333333333333335
3785419,5,B001SER4LA,Great show,1405641600,,10,4.5
3785420,5,B001SER4LA,"I watch these DVDs constantly. It is the funniest show I have ever seen and I love watching it with my friends. At this point we have all seen it hundreds of times (I'm not exaggerating) and still provides fun for the whole group. Shipping is fast, DVD quality is great and it is the hardest I have every laughed in my life -- Boosh!",1402012800,,333,4.138461538461539
3785421,5,B001SER4LA,Received A-ok.,1398297600,,14,6.5
3785422,5,B001SER4LA,This is one of the funniest shows i have ever had the pleasure of watching. Wish that it had.more than just two seasons. BOOSH!,1392422400,,127,4.333333333333333
3785423,5,B001SER4LA,Fan of ARCHER?  Then watch the two season set of Frisky Dingo (and the two hard-to-find X-tacles spin-off) and you will be wondering why you are so late to the party.  Incredible series.,1392076800,,186,4.606060606060606
3785424,5,B001SER4LA,"This show is wonderful. It rejuvenated my faith in cable TV even before Adventure Time came back. Season 2 is pretty weird, but I bet you'll love it if you watch it again. God help me if I could understand how amazing this show must be while under the influence of any drug, I'm pretty clean but even with a bit of alcohol I think it's pretty great.

Killface is the greatest hero ever, and you'll be a bit sad these guys went on to do Archer - a show about only one of the two protagonists at work here. This show gives rise to a ton of quotes too, most of which I use often and wildly out of context.

BOOSH!",1389225600,,610,3.9918032786885247
3785425,5,B001SER4LA,"If you like Archer, you should watch this. I believe it is the same team. Unfortunately it didn't make it past 2 seasons, but the season 2 finale does a decent job of a cliffhanger.",1375315200,,181,4.2
3785426,5,B001SER4LA,"...in my house! If you like off the wall comedy that has a tendency to go a little  too far, just buy these dvds already. if you like other off beat cartoon shows such as aqua teen hunger force, archer and south park, this ranks up with the best of them. So do yourself a favor and get your comedy fix by enjoy your new favorite guilty pleasure... booosh!",1368576000,,355,4.144927536231884
3785427,5,B001SER4LA,"If you love Archer--and who doesn't??--you've got to see 'Frisky Dingo'.  All the 'Archer' tropes and gimmicks, but executed with wild, surrealist abandon.",1365465600,,155,5.739130434782608
3785428,5,B001SER4LA,"everyone should own this series! From the creators of Archer, comes this brilliantly insane show that should have never been canceled.",1352073600,,134,5.428571428571429
3785429,4,B001SER4LA,Frisky Dingo is a hard DVD to track down. it was wonderful to find it at a good price. It wasn't in perfect condition but I was very happy to recieve it and give it to my boyfriend for his birthday. I got it quickly after i ordered it so I had it in time.,1327881600,,255,3.6545454545454548
3785430,1,B001SER4LA,"The Season 1 DVD has NO extras. The Season 2 DVD has a trailer for an Xtacles show that never made it to production, and a commercial for the Season 2 DVD you just bought! I really expected more from the Adult Swim folks. I will be sure to read the product description much more carefully in the future when deciding to buy another one of their DVDs.",1327708800,2,350,4.161764705882353
3785431,5,B001SER4LA,"Frisky Dingo is hilarious! The entire cast of characters offers enough comedy to keep you laughing the entire time. The episodes are only 15 minutes long so if you have attention problems you will love it, or if you want to watch the entire season at once as a movie then you only have to invest 2 hours of your time. A win - win.. Keep in mind Frisky Dingo was part of the Adult Swim line up so it should not be considered a ""kids"" cartoon. The only BAD part of Frisky Dingo is the fact only 2 seasons were released, meaning after you watch the two seasons you will be wanting so much more from Kill Face and Xander Crews but there is no more Frisky Dingo... This was my favorite cartoon for its short term, so I hope you will give it a shot and enjoy it as much as I still do",1317168000,,777,3.9871794871794872
3785432,5,B001SER4LA,I love this show! The episodes are very short and there aren't too many of them so the series flies by and always keeps you interested. This is the craziest show I have ever seen. It is ridiculous and hilarious every second of the way. I highly recommend this show to any adult viewer.,1296345600,,285,4.296296296296297
3785433,5,B001SER4LA,Great comedy.  Only reason this show was cancelled is you MUST watch each episode for it to make any sense.  Can't just pick up in the middle of it.,1295136000,,148,4.068965517241379
3785434,5,B001SER4LA,"I love this show. What else can I say? Worth the money? OF COURSE. Best ever.

8339671,5,B001SER4LA,Some classic adult swim.  I caught some clips of the show on YouTube hadn't seen it in awhile so had to get it.  If you know Aqua Teen Hunger Force the comedy has similarity to the first four seasons.,1489449600,,200,4.102564102564102

8339675,5,B001SER4LA,"I stumbled across Frisky Dingo in high school one night and absolutely loved it.  If I remember correctly this was running with Metalocalypse (which I kinda hate) and early Aqua Teen Hunger Force (which I really like).  I found it near impossible to locate more than a few clips from this show online a while back and when I saw that Amazon had both seasons on DVD I immediately ordered it.  I know a lot of people don't like this show (and many many more have never even heard of it), but I really like the humor and love Killface as the bumbling super villain.  There are several plot lines going at once which (for me) keeps the show fun even when one plot line gets kinda stale.

I think the best aspect of the show is its timing.  The awkward pauses between lines makes it all the funnier for me and the characters having really down-to-earth responses to utterly ridiculous and outlandish situations is hilarious.  This show really isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy the humor and timing of Archer and the kinda bizarro plot of Aqua Teen then you might want to check out Frisky Dingo.  Its too bad they only made two seasons, as there is a clear segue to a third in the last episode.",1457481600,,1191,4.381818181818182
8339676,5,B001SER4LA,"If you like Archer you will love this show. Probably the funniest thing ever on TV. Before they did Archer, Adam Reed and his crew did this comic masterpiece. The only thing I can complain about it is that they only did 2 seasons.",1448668800,,230,4.25
8339677,5,B001SER4LA,Wow i got this fast. I'm a little late on the review but it delievered on-time and ready for my fianc tost by e watch. This show is hilarious.,1446249600,,142,3.9310344827586206
