1421272,5,B00005B6KZ,I loved this movie.  As an Italian American growing up in the 50's and 60's it was a walk down memory lane.,1178928000,2,107,3.8636363636363638
1421273,5,B00005B6KZ,"This film takes place on Staten island in the late 1950s.  It examines the story of an Italian family, Buddy and Estelle, and the way their lives affect an Irish woman whose husband has left her due to her having a black son.  It is a funny film, heartwarming and cute, slightly slow moving, with wonderful vignettes of the 1950s and the ethnic mish-mash of New York in that period.

Buddy is a down on his luck workman who has always dreamed big.  But his businesses have failed: pizza backing, limosine service and finally he has decided to make his house into a bar.  It turns out the house is inhabited by an Irish couple, of whome the husband is an abusive drunkard and the wife turns out to have been pregnant with someone elses baby.  The movie is narrated by the now grown up baby, and follows the interactions, hardships and joys of these people and their community.

Wonderful stuff,

1421274,5,B00005B6KZ,"This was really a beautiful movie about a working class guy (Buddy) from a close knit Italian neighborhood. He gives up an opportunity to become a singer (his dream) to marry a shrewish woman who has no faith in him or his dreams. Fate causes Buddy to cross paths with a young Irish woman who gives birth to a bi racial baby while married to an older irish drunk. keep in mind, this was the 1950s and in Staten Island As time goes on, Buddy falls in love with this fiery, but loyal young woman (Mary) and eventually marries her and takes on the rearing (and loving) of her baby. The affection that the baby had for Buddy shows clearly that was not only was Buddy kind, but strong. In the end you see that Buddy's friends abd family had abandoned him because of his love for Mary and her son.",1151884800,5,791,4.245033112582782
1421275,5,B00005B6KZ,"As a movie fan, every once in awhile, I surprise myself by finding a small, unknown, cinematic treasure, that is truely an enjoyable experience. This seems to be the case, when one night at a sleepless 2am, I found the wonderfully, nostalgic drama, ""Two family House"" on HBO. There is no big budget, ego filled superstar actors, over done special effects or loud explosions. All this film seems to offer up is a moving script and fine, nuanced performances from the actors. ""Two Family House"" takes place in a working class, Italian neighborhood of 1950's Staten Island. Buddy Visalo (Michael Rispoli) is a little guy with big dreams and a plan to fulfill them. He wants to own a bar and fulfill his aspirations of singing in front of an audience. His plan is to buy a two family home, construct and build the bar on the bottom and rent out the second floor to borders to make the venture pay for itself. Unfortunately, his wife, Estelle (Katherine Narducci) dosn't share in his dreams, nor does she have any confidence in her husband being successful at anything. This is a women, who is deeply afraid of being made a laughing stock and is almost obsessed with conforming to the social standards of the neighborhood and community. All is going to plan, until the appearance of the upstairs renters, a married Irish couple expecting a baby. The Irish women, Mary (Kelly Macdonald) gives birth to a mixed-race child. She is subsequently abandoned by her husband and thrown out of the house by Buddy and an insistant, Estelle. Feeling guilty, Buddy secretly helps Mary out and soon a relationship transpires. Mary, a tough and very proud women, turns out to believe in Buddy and his dreams. She helps him realize, what is holding him back in achieving them. It is through his love for her, that Buddy realizes ""who his jailers are"" and how to really change his life. Writer/Director, Raymond De Felitta has created a moving film, with an almost magical tone, based on the true life story of his relatives. This is a smart script about working class people, who share complex emotions. It would be easy for the script to fall into using lazy stereotypes of these people. Instead we get three in-depth character studies of what makes these folks tick. This is especially effective becuase of the great performances, that come from a vey talented cast. All three of the lead actors just make their roles come alive with wonderfully nuanced readings, that brings out both the joy and sorrow that these characters experience. We get to really understand why these people make the descions they make. Finally, mention should be made of the splendid original music soundtrack by Composer, Stephen Endelman. He does a great job of nostalgicaly evoking both the time period and setting of the film. For an evening of wonderful drama, I highly recommend ""Two family House"".",1126828800,17,2861,4.805273833671399
1421276,5,B00005B6KZ,"-- ""My husband and I just finished watching Two Family House. It was a wonderful (and true!) story about an American-Italian man home from WWII who returns to his neighborhood on Staten Island and marries, and above all wants his own home, his own business, and wants to sing (having missed an opportunity to appear on the Arthur Godfrey show). He wants the ""American dream"" -- and how he goes about getting it and who builds him up and who sets out to kill his spirit -- and this is the stuff that movies are made of -- an engrossing character study of a very fine man and the people and women around him. I don't want to give too much away -- this movie unfolds, and many prosaic holes are punched in the local fabric of ""society"" -- conform or not to conform? follow a dream or not to follow a dream? love who you're supposed to love or not? Some very, very libertarian messages are worked into this film without preaching or hitting anyone on the head -- my husband and I both agreed on this. While there is a lot of profanity and racist and ethnic profanities dropped, it is definitly not out of context - in fact, they're used to emphasize the anti-libertarian messages. Be that as it may, the movie was released or made in 2000. It was written and directed by Raymond De Felitta based on the story told him by the hero's adopted son and present owner of the real ""Buddy's Tavern"" - De Felitta is ""Buddy's"" nephew. This is a very non-cliched movie - warmhearted, and thoughtful. Movie running time: 107 mins. Please, please see this movie - I guarantee you you won't be disappointed."" --C.B.",1118102400,8,1597,4.4353741496598635
1421277,4,B00005B6KZ,"A married Italian man falls in love with an Irish woman whose husband left because she gave birth to a black baby! All of this occurs in 1950's Staten Island.
You'll recognize many of the cast members from the Sopranos, but this is no mafia story.
Michael Rispoli is excellent in his search for happiness amid a variety of social issues faced. Marital, familial, ethnic and racial relations are all explored, and the result is a warm, funny and entertaining movie.",1057363200,13,464,4.7407407407407405

1421279,4,B00005B6KZ,"This is essentially a character study of a decent guy, Buddy Visalo, who realizes 11 years into his marriage to Estelle that his family and friends are his jailers, stopping him from realizing his dreams of running a tavern.  Estelle crushed his dream of auditioning for Arthur Godfrey's TV show, now she would have him stay at a mind numbing factory job for the sake of conformity.  He buys a two-family house (against Estelle's objections), and when he meets his upstairs tenants, an Irish-American boozehound and his pregnant wife,  his life starts to change.  There is a happy ending, there is virtually no profanity (hurray!), and the setting of time and place, 1956 in Staten Island, NY, is realistic.  Many of the actors are from The Sopranos, and this enhances the sense of familiarity one feels instantly with this group of Italian-Americans leading ordinary lives.  There are no big speeches, no grandstanding displays of emotions, just the quiet depiction of a man re-gaining his own sense of self worth after years after putting his dreams on hold. Buddy is a decent guy, and you cheer him on his journey.",992649600,23,1117,4.883597883597884
1421280,5,B00005B6KZ,"What an absolutely lovely film this was. And what a shame it never enjoyed wider release, for it is eminently worth viewing. I was even more delighted when I found out that it really was based on a true story...the director/writer is Buddy's nephew.
Buddy Visalo is a lovable, warm, and bumbling dreamer whose wife Estelle constantly deflates his trial balloons--because she is expected to by her culture and the times they lived in. She wants Buddy to take no chances and would rather he kept a job he hated than try something new and more daring.
To realize his dream, Buddy must ignore Estelle and also evict  the pregnant Mary O'Neary from the upstairs of the place where he hopes to start his bar. This eviction pains him greatly. How he assuages his pain and helps her out is the heart and soul of ""Two-Family House"".
This is a movie about doing good for someone and expecting nothing in return, about trying to fulfill a dream and dealing with the obstacles that are in your way. It is not a complex movie with a hidden agenda and messages tangled up in a lot of gimmickry. There are serious themes treated seriously, but never in a preachy way. It is just uplifting and full of truths with a hero who is Everyman. As one reviewer said ....""Buddy is off on an adventure that surprises even him. To accompany him is to experience filmgoing joy.""",992131200,41,1351,4.536885245901639

1421328,5,B00005B6KZ,"I loved Raymond De Felitta's ""City Island,"" so when I read reviews stating that his earlier film, ""Two Family House,"" was even better, I rented ""Two Family House"" immediately. The reviewers were right; although ""City Island"" is vastly entertaining and beautifully acted, ""Two Family House"" is a cut above it--a little masterpiece, a tiny but flawless gem.

Set on Staten Island in 1956, ""Two Family House"" tells the story of Buddy Visalo (Michael Rispoli), an all-American dreamer with a string of failed business ventures and a disapproving nag of a wife (Katherine Narducci). Buddy buys the eponymous, severely dilapidated house with the plan of turning the first story into a tavern and the second into his home. However, Buddy must deal first with O'Neary (Kevin Conway), the drunken, abusive Irishman who is the second story's current tenant, and Mary (Kelly Macdonald), O'Neary's much younger, heavily pregnant wife. And that is really all I should tell you about the plot, to preserve the funny and touching surprises De Felitta has in store. I will tell you that the entire cast is excellent--especially Rispoli as a working-class guy who discovers his humanity even as his wife and friends think he's lost his mind, and Macdonald as a hard-luck young woman confused by Buddy's stumbling efforts to be kind.

Reminiscent of both ""Marty"" and ""Moonstruck,"" but with a delicate magic all its own, ""Two Family House"" reminds us that people who seem to be violating community values may in fact be transcending them. It is a lovely film, one you will cherish and want to see many times.",1276387200,4,1589,4.992452830188679

The movie follows Buddy, a good natured Italian (ok, Italian-American) guy in New York who just wants to build a bar. His wife Estelle thinks that his idea is doomed to fail like so many of his previous schemes & has no problem telling him so. It isn't until he has to evict the squatter upstairs, a sweet single mother named Mary that he decides to help out, that he finds someone who is not only willing to listen to his plans but also give him encouragement.

I really did enjoy this movie. It wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it's something I'd love to watch again & again. (If that makes any sense.) I loved watching the romance unfold between Mary & Buddy, as well as hoping that he'd come to his senses & realize his wife is a harpy that needs to go. The ending is a bit bittersweet, but I really did like it.

(SPOILER)

I'd have liked to see the narrator as a grownup though...

If you are looking for something that's a bang-bang-shoot-em-up or something along the lines of 'The Sopranos' (since much of the movie's cast was also in the show), you won't find it here.

1421330,5,B00005B6KZ,"""Two Family House"" is a quiet and charming independent release that received little genaral release in theatres.  I kept telling friends about it, but most could not find it in theatres.  Those who did, were as taken with the film as I was.  Once it was available on DVD, I once again urged anyone who loved film to catch up with it, and I received much in the way of thanks and positive feedback.  Raymond DeFelitta, who has most recently given us the fascinating documentary ""'Tis Autumn: The Search for Jackie paris,"" has sculptured a warm slice of life film about a man looking for satisfaction in a world of doubters.  Most of the actors will not be familiar by name, nor even be familiar by sight, but the cast is perfect for this little gem of a film.

I could have only imagined the strife that her mother must have dealt with in the early 1900's. It is a shame that one reviewer could be so ignorant, I don't know if the one star represented his/her distaste for interaccial relations or the fact that the woman cheated on her husband? In any event it's a movie... the Irish mother only dealt w/ hardships because of everyone else's ignorance and the fact that she married that man for the wrong reason. You have to find happiness where  you can. If it means going against ""societal"" beliefs to find it then it must be done. Buddy and Mary's character showed courage in the face of ignorance despite the choices they made. Overall the story was put together very well.",1230249600,,1004,4.456521739130435
