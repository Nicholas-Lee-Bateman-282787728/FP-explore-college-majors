8086167,5,B000BFNJO8,"There are scenes in this movie that are not only breathtaking cinematic-ally, but the acting and emotions are exquisite.  I have watched this about 4 times and finally bought the movie because I know I will watch it over and over again. It is a classic and the protagonist is someone that I could relate to and felt his loneliness, compassion, courage and exuberance for life and its adventures.",1361404800,,395,4.72463768115942
