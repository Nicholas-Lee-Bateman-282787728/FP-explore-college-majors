8364899,4,B002D7VFQ6,If you can survive the horribly dated Stepin Fetchit role (which at times approaches an interesting pathos) this is an entertaining film. Will Rogers is always a pleasure.,1474934400,,171,5.142857142857143

If a person wants to see the genius of Will Rodger's this certainly will be one of the best venues to view.will would ad lib and concoct his lines on the spot according to director John Ford. This is not for the politically correct or the hyper sensitive types but if you are from Old Dixie and love a good laugh, Steamboat awaits you!",1415318400,,380,4.366197183098592
8364903,5,B002D7VFQ6,"A classic that is worth watching given you have an interest in some aspect of the movie.  Since it was filmed in the California Sacramento Delta, that was my attraction for watching.  If you enjoy Paddle Wheel steamboat's there would be another reason to watch.  It's a simple plot but kept our attention throughout the movie. The informative commentary by Author Scott Eyman is interesting, something the viewers of 1935 did not get.",1291593600,,434,4.917808219178082

He had remembered a very funny part in the first movie, however, that funny part was not in this DVD. So, I don't know if this was an edited version or not. If it was edited, maybe I can find the original one.  I, myself, have not seen it yet.",1249603200,,376,3.8701298701298703
