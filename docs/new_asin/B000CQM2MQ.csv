This DVD is gorgeous, and the relaxing music is just beautiful.  I can only describe it as ""easy listening bluegrass""--and I would love a CD of it!  Quiet, calm guitars, fiddles, banjos, and dobros made for great listening as we visited places I've seen over the years, and where my dad grew up.  I've taken several friends on driving trips through this part of southern Missouri to see Blue Spring, Round Spring, Big Spring, and Alley Spring, all of which are featured on this wonderful guide to the headwaters and canoeing sections of the Current and Jacks Fork Rivers near Eminence and Winona in Missouri.  This is a truly beautiful part of the country, and it's really making us want to plan a float trip--just as soon as the flood waters recede a bit and the rivers have time to get clear again.  ;-)

We got this DVD from the library, but here I am to get it for Dad for Father's Day.  He's going to LOVE it!",1304726400,,1102,4.394088669950739
8100391,2,B000CQM2MQ,"The CD was great for the scenery, but gave no information on what you were looking at.  It would have been more helpful if it had been narrated by someone telling you where you were, & some info about the area.",1285804800,,210,4.121951219512195

8100394,5,B000CQM2MQ,"Awesome scenery and wonderful music to compliment this float down paradise.  I was so excited to experience my 2 favorite rivers in this fashion.  The next best thing to being there!  I'm so excited to share this with my non-canoeing friends too.  I'm heading to Jam up Cave in 2 weeks myself!

8100395,5,B000CQM2MQ,"I loved everything about The Ozark Riverways: Exploring the Current and Jacks Fork Rivers!

Dave Hargis captures the beautiful scenery I remember growing up on the Jacks Fork River. The Ozark Riverways, filmed without narration and a score of restful bluegrass music shows how peaceful Missouri Ozark rivers are as you float downstream, surrounded by the pristine beauty of Mother Nature.

I congratulate him for sharing the serenity of the Ozark Mountains on a wonderful river journey. The excellent photography made me feel like I was along in the canoe. The breathtaking outdoor experience shows why Life Magazine lists the Jacks Fork River one of the ten most scenic rivers in the world.",1141948800,,691,5.106194690265487
8100396,5,B000CQM2MQ,"The rec room at my house is called Firebrook Lodge and  is dedicated to canoeing and the rivers of Missouri.  This is the perfect movie for my guests to be watching while they wait for me to prepare their dinner in several dutch ovens outside.  This is as close as you can come to showing people what its all about, and not actually being there.  Thanks so much..........you caught the sights and sounds perfectly.",1141171200,,414,4.554054054054054

As soon as it came in the mail, I popped it in the player and was awe struck at the breathtaking videography.  Dave has captured all of the popular Current River and Jacks Fork sites.  It made me feel like I was right there!  This is a must have for anyones DVD collection.  I can't wait for the sequel, lol!!!",1139616000,,441,4.2023809523809526
