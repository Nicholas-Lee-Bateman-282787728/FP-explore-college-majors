8150084,4,B000JD69RQ,"Part of Japanese 'pink' cinema (read soft porn) its a little better than what we may get in the west.  A young girl (though according to the film she is in her 30s she doesnt look it)  Meets a young man at the sea side who falls off his scooter.  She starts up a relationship with him, making a packed lunch for him every day (hence the title of the film) but there the relationship starts to go wrong.  The man she is in love with meets a lady at work who is more of, shall we say a 'decent girl' and who he intends to marry.  More and more their relationship turns sour and her intensity and obsession with him drives him more and more away and closer to the woman he intends to marry resulting in terrible consiquences.

This film is an intensly erotic film and the women in this film are beautiful (as Asian women are) The guy she is fighting for is something of a geek (hope for all of us then) and this film does continue the trend (mostly popular in French films) of the pug ugly guy and the beautiful young woman.  I do however, like the story of this film and the obsession that this lady in this film has.
