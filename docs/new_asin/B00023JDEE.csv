The content is very clear and easy to follow. The three choreographies are beautiful. I'm a hula dance beginner and I learned more new things about hula. Thanks.",1162166400,9,307,4.4035087719298245
2059121,4,B00023JDEE,"This DVD does well with teaching the basic foot patterns and hand motions but, it's difficult to learn the dance bcuz the motions aren't mirrored. When the dancer is using her right hand or foot you have to conciously think to do the same instead of mirroring. Overall great DVD with good explanations for the basics.",1155168000,31,317,4.678571428571429

8021406,4,B00023JDEE,"3-5-2013  How to Hula CD
I purchased this CD a couple of years ago and I had a lot of fun refreshing my memory of How to Hula (I danced in a Polynesian Dance Troupe for 5 years).  The dancing and instruction in this CD is excellent!  I highly recommend it for the purpose of learning Hula.  But, I do have some criticism of the CD:

1.  The dance Keep Your Eyes on the Hands is an insulting and vulgar dance.  In the 40s and 50s ""Hollywood Hula"" became the ""rage"".  The intent of ""Hollywood Hula"" was to degrade the woman's body in suggesting that it was nasty.
2. I don't like the red lip-stick and make-up.  I prefer ""the natural look"" of radiant health due to exposure from sunshine and fresh air.
3. The costuming was OK.  Hula is also great danced in a grass skirt with bra.  This attire makes women aware of their body health.
These are my only negative comments on the CD.

NOTE:  I would only recommend women to Hula Dance before a Christian, non-alcohol-drinking audience.  Women are beautiful when kept in a ""Christian context/environment"".  My idea is a Poet Museum:

Here is a meditation warning about Hollywood Hula taken from my website:

Hollywood Hula

Oh hula dancer beware ---

Of ""non-authentic"" hula out there.

Beware of that which makes beauty ---

Ugly or nasty.

Much of ""Hollywood Hula"" is full of jealousy

Of the womanly body.

The Devil takes what is beautiful

And makes it disgustful!

Oh, even dances like ""Tiny Bubbles""

Can instigate some troubles:

Encouraging alcoholic drink

Is encouraging people not to think.

And remember that insult

Is of the Devil's Cult!

Don't give that Devil a moment of your time;

Always and forever: let your Gospel Light shine!
