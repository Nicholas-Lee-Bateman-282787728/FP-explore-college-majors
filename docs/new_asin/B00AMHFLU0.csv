8553665,1,B00AMHFLU0,Not a documentary at all. It's five songs. From the look of it they were filmed off of TV shows in the 60's. Worst purchase I ever made. I felt duped. Live and learn!,1482105600,2,166,3.911764705882353

8553667,1,B00AMHFLU0,"First off, this is NOT A DOCUMENTARY. Second, it's less than 20 minutes long. The running time listed is 40 minutes. The Byrds were an amazing band and I've waited for a comprehensive documentary about them for years. This is not a documentary and I only gave it 1 star because it has some live footage of the band. I'm extremely disappointed. There are no extras, no commentary, nothing. To have the words ""musical documentary"" in the title is seriously misleading and well, frankly, a flat-out lie. It's insulting to the customers and more importantly this product is insulting to The Byrds.",1404086400,,593,4.823529411764706

8553669,1,B00AMHFLU0,"A 12-minute, 46 seconds-long DVD of six low-video-quality performances? Something like this should not be sold, it should be given away! But even if it was a giveaway item, it still shouldn't be passed off as a 40-minute ""documentary""! SHAME on the people who made this!!",1375833600,10,271,4.913043478260869
8553670,2,B00AMHFLU0,"This DVD contains six videos of songs played by the Byrds in their entirety. The songs and their original sources are (1) Not Fade Away (a cover version of the Rolling Stones cover of Buddy Holly's song) - Shindig! 6/23/65, (2) Mr. Tambourine Man - the Big T.N.T. Show filmed on 11/29/65, (3) Chimes of Freedom - Shindig! 10/23/65, (4) The Bells of Rhymney - Shindig! 9/16/65, (5) Turn Turn Turn - Shindig! 10/23/65, and (6) I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better - Shindig! 9/16/65.

The video quality is poor.  All of the videos listed above are readily available for viewing on the Internet (generally in similar to better video quality).  The entire DVD runs for about 12:45 (not 40 minutes).  There is no documentary narrative at all - just the video clips.  As stated by others, the product description listed by Amazon is quite inaccurate and misleading.",1365897600,14,851,4.722972972972973
8553671,1,B00AMHFLU0,"see the reviews that are already there.....it's a complete rip-off and not a ""documentary"" as advertised. You shouldn't carry it. Shame!!",1365206400,6,137,5.571428571428571
8553672,1,B00AMHFLU0,"As a BYRDS fan I was looking forward to this dvd. Total running time
of 12 mins 46 secs.is nothing but a rip off. I hope Amazon will do
something about this item,such as refund the money wasted on this
""Documentary"".Also if every dvd was advertised with the total running
time no one would buy this. Amazon do something please.....",1362614400,19,331,4.533333333333333
8553673,1,B00AMHFLU0,"Just some grainy images of The Byrds playing 6 of their songs on mid sixties TV.  There is not commentary and the whole dvd is only about 20 minutes.  They deserve a documenatry, but this is not it.",1361404800,22,198,4.184210526315789
