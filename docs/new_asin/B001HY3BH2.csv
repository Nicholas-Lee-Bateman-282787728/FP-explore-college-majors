8310019,5,B001HY3BH2,"If you are wondering whether or not you should just buy the CD set of On The Two Deaths of Pain of Salvation or spring for this deluxe box set that also includes a pair of DVDs consider this: For roughly double the price of the CDs themselves you get a DVD featuring the songs on the CDs live in concert, a DVD with a documentary on the European leg of the band's tour, a plethora of extras on both DVDs AND a very attractive large format booklet containing some excellent pictures, lyrics and pertinent album info. This set is literally packed with value making it the obvious one to buy.
Here's what I like best of the music both on the CDs and on the concert DVD: The opener Scarsick which sets the tone for a raucous set; the hell-raising Nightmist; the rousing New Year's Eve; the slight Zep feel of Chain Sling; the riotous Flame To the Moth; the hilarious Disco Queen that eclipses Zappa's Dancing Fool; and the intense and magnificent Cribcaged that indicts and denounces celebrity culture and the crass ostentatious materialism it engenders.
As for the documentary, it is very long and really only for the hard-core fan. I enjoyed seeing it once, but I can't imagine watching again. I'd rather listen to the music. Then there are all the extras I haven't yet had time to view. Can't comment on those but think that even without them I got my money's worth.
On the Two Deaths of Pain of Salvation is one box set that really does live up to its hype and provides real value for money. If you like the kind of intense, imaginative metal as played by Pain of Salvation you are going to be delighted with this. Order it soon before the price gets jacked up.",1257638400,5,1661,4.431372549019608
8310020,4,B001HY3BH2,"If people like ""Pain of salvation"", I can recomend this documentary about the life on the road for the band. They do a lot more of the hard work of putting up the consert then I thought!",1243468800,,186,4.054054054054054
8310021,5,B001HY3BH2,"(I'll focus on the DVDs in this review. The CDs are simply the concert audio with, I believe, some of the audience talk thankfully cut down)

This is two things: A documentary and a live concert recording.

In the documentary we follow the band from their their last rehersal and out on the road in western europe. It's a decent documentary, with glimpses into the life on the road as a medium-to-small act. We've seen much of it before; The Devoted Fan following the band between countries, the roadies, life on the tour bus. It's all there.

Some of the best parts are seeing the guys interacting with each other. You see that they're truly a band. Some of it is heart-breaking, as when we get to experience the tention as Kristoffer takes off to be with his wife instead of hanging with the band, and the gritty economic realities expressed in Johan Hallgren's comments on how he can't take the hit of leaving another job for the band.

There are two different commentary tracks for the documentary, though only the most devoted will make it through both.

The concert is good. Nice energy, good set list (with both '!' and a wonderful rendition of 'Nightmist' you can't complain), and considering the numbers they pull, fairly good production values. Audio and video is good. Just don't expect something like a Nightwish or Within Temptation Black Symphony production.

The extras aren't anything special, but there are some interesting demo versions of tracks on there, and a truly evil bit of video with Johan Langell singing without audio in his monitor.

In a bit of an ironic twist, while the documentary DVD features a dummy hidden meny where they talk about how you shouldn't have to go through hoops to get at the content you've already paid for, a sentiment I share, the concert DVD actually has most of its extras hidden behind a quiz. Let me save you some time; the code is 1764.

Short story: This is a must have for any Pain of Salvation aficionado. I don't think these guys have any casual fans, but if they do, heck at this price, just get the limited edition if you can. It's just a very solid package.",1241827200,7,2122,4.610079575596817
8310022,5,B001HY3BH2,"After waiting an eternity for this release, I was so pumped to finally get it in the mail.  The documentary is really great and offers a very authentic back-stage experience with the band.  The live CDs/DVD is absolutely amazing and a chance for someone in the States, where PoS had previously refused to tour, to see really how talented this band is live (aside from Daniel's hilariously terrible crowd banter)!  Watching Daniel sing and play the rhythms on ""Handful of Nothing"" is a definite highlight, as well as their rendition of ""Hallelujah"" and a chill version of ""Undertow"".

Definitely recommend this to Pain of Salvation and progressive rock fans.",1240790400,3,657,5.0
8310023,4,B001HY3BH2,"I knew this DVD would have a lot of material from ""Scarsick"" (not my favorite POS album) but I bought this without hesitation and it's not too shabby! Disc one has a documentary of the band on the road during their 2005 tour (1 hour 14 minutes) and it's really well done. There are subtitles to this feature in English, French, and Swedish. The band mates seem to be down to earth and humble, but they are too serious and should lighten up. They don't seem to be having a lot of fun (either on stage or on the road) and stage presence is not the strength of this band. However, their playing and vocal harmonies are superb. They nail most songs.

The concert (disc two) is 1 hour and 48 minutes long. Highlights are ""New Year's Eve"" and ""Ashes"". Lowlights are ""Disco Queen"" and ""Hallelujah"". The audio mixes are stereo, DD, and DTS. The surround mixes do not use the center speaker. The video edits are quick but it's not horrid. What is horrid are the extras. On disc two you have to pass a quiz to view any of them. After you pass the quiz and are found ""worthy"" then you can watch them. Well, they aren't worthy of the time you wasted taking the test. Also, some of the extras are bogus, i.e., when you press the enter button on the remote you get a reply like ""I got you - you moron""! Really stupid and irritating stuff. Finally, the DVD booklet comes with a story and the lyrics to every song they played, but you need a microscope to read it. Overall, if you're a fan, this is a must and you won't be disappointed.",1238457600,8,1520,4.259515570934256
