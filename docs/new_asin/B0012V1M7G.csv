8247882,5,B0012V1M7G,"It is a great dance video for kids! My two year old daughter found it on the shelf in the library, so we borrowed it. Then she has been watching this 30-minute video at least twice a day! She loved dancing to the video in her ballerina dress and tapping shoes! That is why I decided to buy it on Amazon! The DVD came in good condition. I am happy with this purchase.",1447027200,2,366,4.027397260273973

8247884,5,B0012V1M7G,"My granddaughter started watching this when she was maybe 2 or 3 years old.  She loved watching me tap dance - especially if I would hold her like a football on my hip, so she could see my feet tapping on the floor.  (That got old, for, me.)  When she first saw this, she watched it day after day after day!  She quickly memorized the words.  I thought the dancing horses were dumb.  She loved them.  I fell in love with Corky, who shows that working hard at something you want to do really CAN pay off.  And, the Clap and Tap game is a wonderful way to help the students learn to ""think on their feet.""  All in all, our family has been very thankful for this video.  It has taught our grandchildren some of the most basic steps and kept them entertained.  If you think this video is dorky, put your 3 year old in front of it and watch them have a blast and learn, too!",1348099200,,869,4.0828402366863905
8247885,5,B0012V1M7G,"We really enjoyed Bella Dancerella Swan Lake and Bella Dancerella Cinderella, so we decided to branch out and try Tap is a Snap.  I was surprised by the differences in style and production quality.  This video has a very ""Elmo"" or ""Sesame Street"" feel to it, complete with dancing ponies (people in large plush costumes), ""Stamp and Stomp"" which are two puppet tap shoes, and the hand-drawn scenery like you might see in an Elmo video.  Corky is fun, and adds an unexpected element of humor to the video, along with an encouraging story of seeing someone who thought they could never learn to dance overcome that feeling and of course, dance like a pro in the end.

I like how the basics are previewed with close-ups of the feet before they do them in a song, and I also like the ""clap and tap"" game they do - it teaches good rhythm and makes it fun for my kids.  My 3 year old is the real dance fanatic, and she loves this!  My boy/girl 6-yr-old twins also enjoy watching it, and will dance along sometimes, too.  There is nothing offensive in it, and they even use a few little clips of Ginger Rogers dancing in the background.

The other surprise about this video is that Bella has an heavy Austrailian (or New Zealand?) accent!  I thought it might be the same girl who played Bella in the Swan Lake video, because they do look similar, but clearly this was made outside of the US.  I kind of like that my kids can learn to understand even thickly accented English.

The only things I don't like about the video is that some of the basic steps are not explained in words, you have to figure it out by watching (like the difference between a stamp and a stomp), and I was a little put-off at first by the production style.  But after I saw how much my kids enjoyed it (even my 1 year old likes to watch and dance!), I am pleased.",1327536000,3,1831,4.3061224489795915
8247886,5,B0012V1M7G,"My 3 yr old grandaughter loves the ""Bella"" series. She watches them all the time and practices the dances very seriously!",1316044800,2,121,4.809523809523809
8247887,5,B0012V1M7G,"I had bought ""Dancing for Kids"" a while ago, and my kids really enjoyed the Jazz.  My daughter also got into the ballet.  We then got Bella Dancerella Ballet which taught my daughter the 5 foot positions.  Well now we have ""Tap is a Snap"", and this is what they want to see.  I got Prima Princessa Ballet at the same time, but I'll have to wait until they tire of this before I can show it again, because they just kept saying ""We want to do tap"".  There is a male dancer named Corky who is basically a clown character, which was a nice surprise for me since 2 of my 3 are boys.",1272499200,2,578,3.991304347826087
