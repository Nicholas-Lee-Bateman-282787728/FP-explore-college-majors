8334086,5,B001PPGAM6,This was a chance to see one of my favorite funny guys before he was a hit on early tv. Tim Moore headlines this musical revue on film with some neat footage of the Nat Cole Trio. I didn't know much about Moore until Jack Parr had him his show one night. He told more stories about the chitlin' circuit that had Parr on the floor and the audience in hysterics. Great all-black cast film history.,1382572800,2,395,4.2105263157894735

After the successful legal desegregation of the film industry in '48, this type of movie vanished, literally. Today, only a fifth of the original 500 race films still exist.

BOARDING HOUSE BLUES--  Performers who reside at Moms Mabley's theatrical boarding house put on a stage show to save their Harlem digs from foreclosure. The story's an excuse to hang a marvelous vaudeville-like variety program on. (Watch for the one-legged dancer 'Crip' Heard!)

BOY! WHAT A GIRL!--  Two struggling variety show producers try to convince a wealthy Chicagoan to bankroll half their costs.

KILLER DILLER--  As with ""Boardinghouse,"" this thinly-plotted movie is in reality an all-black variety show featuring some legendary talents. There's swing music, singers, tappers (Clark Bros.), comics (Moms Mabley, et al), cool sounds (King Cole Trio) and lots more in this delightful document of mid-20th Century African-American entertainment.
