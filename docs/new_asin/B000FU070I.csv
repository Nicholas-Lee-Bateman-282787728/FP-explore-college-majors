8126624,5,B000FU070I,Great family movie. Very well done.  Let me know that my American 'neighbors' includes a much larger 'family'.  Also made me feel a bit sad that we can't always get along like we know we should.  Also made me feel grateful for my heritage.,1375747200,,239,4.386363636363637
8126625,5,B000FU070I,This is a movie based on the Book by Lana McKisaick.  This is a book that appears in many Anthology Reading Books for 4th and 5th graders.  I like the class to take notes and to compare the book and the movie.,1372032000,,209,3.9523809523809526

8126627,4,B000FU070I,Good young adolescent flick. Teaches to be satisfied with what you have. Hard work and perseverance can and do pay off in the end. Many hardships befall the main characters yet understanding and peace prevail. Good film for the whole family. Beautiful countryside cinematography.,1363737600,,279,5.363636363636363

8126629,5,B000FU070I,"It's a typical film about the Japanese immigration in the American Continent, in the first half of twenty century. At that time, many Japanese dreamed to work in America, with intention to ""make fortune"" there and return to Japan. This didn't happen only in the United States or Canada. Many Japanese families had immigrated for other Latin-American countries, all with the same dream.

The story happens in the 30's and shows basically how the Japanese lived in the new country, and the problems that they had faced, such as culture, language, discrimination etc. Rinko is a girl who lives in the city, and has to pass the summer vacations helping her cousins and her aunt, Hata, in a small-cucumber-farm. It would have to be a boring vacation for Rinko but, in the end, she will learn important things about her culture and her origins. EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!",1112745600,,857,4.86986301369863
