8060682,3,B0009HBPNA,"Nobody's a bigger PRIDE fan than yours truly. The day that organization fell in battle to the UFC was a sad one for me, and I think the sport of mixed marial arts has suffered very badly as a result. Having said that, I would be lying if I said that PRIDE 24: COLD FURY was a great card or even a particularly good one. It's kind of like a firecracker whose fuse burns and burns but never actually goes off.

On paper, this should have been a barnburner. You had Guy Metzger, Antonio (Big Nog)ueria, Rodrigo Gracie, Alistair Ovareem, Kevin ""the Monster"" Randleman, Murilo ""Ninja"" Rua, Dan Henderson and Antinio (Little Nog)ueria, all on the same card. Unfortunately, as is sometimes the case in combat sports, it's not the names that matter, but the styles, and in this card, the styles didn't necessarily make for great fights. Without spoiling the outcomes, here is my take on the fights:

Matsui vs. Okubo: forgettable fight between two forgettable fighters.
Metzger vs. Big Nog: this was a case of one legend being a bit too old to get off, and the other showing a bit too much respect for his opponent. A disappointment.
V. Ovareem vs. Waterman: A fight between two second-tier fighters.
Gracie vs. Saskasi: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Otsuka vs. Yammamoto: Remember when Otsuka was being billed as the next big thing to come out of Japan? Me neither.
Atajev vs. A. Ovareem: This is a good fight, and has lots of seesaw action and a surprise ending.
Randleman vs. Rua: A lot less action than you'd expect given the all-action reputation of both fighters.
Henderson vs. Little Nog: This is an outstanding fight between two legends that features some of the most outstanding submission defense I've ever seen.

You see what I mean? With one big exception (Hendo vs Big Nog) and one little exception (Alistair O vs. Atajev) the fights are either lackluster or ""just okay."" They lack the firepower and charisma that the really good Pride fights usually brought to the table. It's not a terrible card, and the fight between Hendo and Nog has become legenadary (and rightly so) but it's not one you should shell out a lot of duckets for.",1319068800,,2127,4.697050938337801

COLD FURY 3

This was a pretty good event, though it was not the best held by Pride.

1. GUY MEZGER VS ANTONIO ROGERIO NOGUEIRA-this fight was between two pretty big names in this sport, though at the time this was only Nogueira's 6th fight or something. Pretty good first round as Mezger ground and pounds, and Rogerio hits some submissions like a knee bar. But for the most part they feel each other out. Round two looked a lot like round one with the addition of a low blow to Guy. The final round mimicked the first two rounds with some punching, take downs, and a lot chess playing. Nogueira ends up taking the split decision, but this was really a technical chess game. 4/5

2. RON EATERMAN VS VALENTIJN OVEREEM-this ended up being the opposite of the last fight. Waterman comes out and takes down Overeem and immediately locks in a key lock. This was a quick and entertaining fight, good fight and really quick. 5/5

3. RODRIGO GRACIE VS YUKI SASAKI-the legendary Gracie name is on the line again in this fight, would Rodrigo take this fight with this being his second MMA bout ever. The first round was a battle on the ground, as they traded back and forth offensively. Round two was another round spent on the ground, as both were waiting for the other to make a mistake. I would say that round three was the best of all three, and following the final round Gracie was awarded the fight. All that Deathrow Records music he was listing to like ""Natural Born Killers"" did him good. 4.5/5

4. BAZIGIT ATAJEV VS ALISTAIR OVEREEM-very exciting opening round  between these two titans, both tried to end this fight every time they could. Reversals, punches, take downs, submissions, and a nice spinning heel kick. The second round is just as good, ending with a nice knee to the body that stops Atajev. Very entertaining fight. 5/5

5. KEVIN RANDLEMAN VS MURILO ""NINJA"" RUA-two more big names in this sport collide in this bout. Kevin came into this fight with a new training attitude, and Ninja came into this listing to Lionel Richie. Excellent first round, it was really explosive and well paced. Both tried to end the fight numerous times, great first round. The second round was another well paced round, with Kevin slamming Ninja. The end comes early in the third due to a doctor stoppage, when Ninja gets cut open bad on his right eye. This was a very good fight. 5/5

6. ANTONIO RODRIGO NOGUEIRA VS DAN HENDERSON-this was the big rematch between the two and Nogueira was looking to avenge his only loss against Dan Henderson. What's funny is that even though Henderson won the last fight between the two he was still the underdog. Very good first round between these two, both give it all they got in the first round alone. Submission after submission, and Henderson finds a way out of all of them. The second round was just as good as the first with Henderson displaying a never say die attitude, excellent round. The fight ends in the third when Dan gets hooked in an arm bar, the heavyweight champ Nogueira avenges his loss. 5/5

7. BONUS FIGHT-YOSHIHISA YAMAMOTO VS ALEXANDER OTSUKA-this fight in my opinion is a lot like the Mezger fight, a good chess match between two warriors. The first round is good with some decent knees, and some good ground game. The fight ends in the second when Otsuka is unable to continue, and unable to even stand up. Good fight over all. 4.5/5

Over all this is a much better event then people want you to believe, for every MMA fan out there this is a worthy addition to your collection.",1218412800,,3544,4.549450549450549
8060684,2,B0009HBPNA,"Of the modern Pride era this is possibly one of the most lackluster events I have seen.  All but two of the fights on the card are dull affairs.  Little action and results that have no consequence as far as the future of the fighters concerned characterize 6 of the 8 fights.  However, two fights stand out as quality fights.  Randleman vs Ninja features ""the Monster"" turning Rua's right eye into roast beef.  A pleasant sight to watch.  The main event of Nogueira vs Henderson is a highly technical affair with great suspense as Henderson amazingly escapes submission after submission.  Overall, however, a poor card that leaves one asking, ""Is that it?""",1211587200,,656,4.803571428571429
8060685,4,B0009HBPNA,"This night of Pride Fighting begins with Pride veteran Guy Mezger going up against Antonio Rogerio Nogueira, twin brother of heavyweight champion Rodrigo. These two skilled fighers all but cancel each other out in the first round. There's not all that much happening here, but the fight gets a bit more exciting in the 2nd round. The fight is not too entertaining and it goes to a decision.

Old-time UFC veteran Ron Waterman makes a quick statement with his fight against Valentijn Overeem.

Rodrigo Gracie then takes on Yuki Sasaki. After getting through a very uninteresting first round, we are treated to the same thing in rounds two and three. This one goes to a decision.

Alistair Overeem v. Volk Ataev-

Ataev lands one of the most beautiful spinning heel kicks I've ever seen in MMA competition. Upon replay, you see that it doesn't land as flushly as everyone first thinks, but it was enough to drop Overeem to the mat, at least temporarily. This fight ends quickly and unexpectedly, with two highly charged combatants. There is good action in this fight.

Murilo Ninja Rua v. Kevin Randleman-

Pride rising star Murilo Ninja takes on the ever-irritating Kevin Randleman. I was, however, excited for a very good fight. Randleman quickly takes Rua down and attempts to make it another fight in his usual unamusing style of a takedown followed by  Randleman lying on top of his opponent until the end of the round... This fight is a good back and forth battle, as Rua is too good to be held down by Randleman. This one is stopped in the 3rd due to a bad cut. Another good fight.

Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira v. Dan Henderson-

Everyone expected Nogueira to walk through Henderson in this bout. Henderson had actually beaten Nogueira years back, but Nogueira is a different fighter by this point. Everyone was surprised by the way this fight actually played out. Henderson escapes numerous submission attempts by one of the best submission artists in the game. This fight is very exciting and we see technical skill and precision against pure heart... Great fight.

This is a decent event. It starts out very slowly, with little action and it picks up as it progresses. The main event was certainly the highlight of this event.",1153785600,2,2231,4.801566579634465
