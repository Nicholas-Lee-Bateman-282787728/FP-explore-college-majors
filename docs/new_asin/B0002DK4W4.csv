Following its success with a trio of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT compilations, M-G-M  releases this anthology sampler from its musical library plainly as advertisement for home video sales, and it is a most enjoyable collection indeed, proving that there are many splendid moments yet to be peeled from the studio's vaults, offering here non-stop pleasure following a brief introduction by entertainer Michael Feinstein.  The 72 minute film is replete with well-directed scenes, with first-class M-G-M production values in evidence throughout and clever lyrics being a constant, highlights including Howard Keel and the company of brothers performing ""Sobbin' Women"" from SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS (1954), multi-talented Virginia O'Brien along with Gloria DeHaven and June Allyson in a comedic rendition of ""In A Little Spanish Town"" from THOUSANDS CHEER (1943), and many other pleasing performances from such as Ben Blue, Tommy Dorsey, Bob Fosse, Betty Garrett, Kathryn Grayson, Lena Horne, Van Johnson, Gene Kelly, Groucho Marx, Ray McDonald, Ann Miller, Jules Munshin, Donald O'Connor, Jane Powell, Debie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney, Esther Williams, et alia, in a picture that ends far too quickly.",1104969600,12,1248,5.663101604278075
