8422821,2,B004C69GLM,"I watched all 23 episodes over several days on Netflix. The acting is superb but they lacked technical advice in many areas. Tradecraft nonexistent. e.g., pick up a note at a dead drop then just stand there and read it. Many other faux pas. No one aims their weapons, they all shoot from the waist, no aiming. Last three or four episodes just don't hang together. Improbable escapes; three days E&E-ing in a forest with no one disheveled; a cave-hospital from nowhere; etc. It started out as a well put together series then slowly made less and less sense. Too bad since there were many extremely heroic actions done by British agents in WWII. Note latest news (Jul 2012) of the death of French resistance hero Count Robert de La Rochefoucauld. He is reported to have commented on both the incredible bravery of the British and their atrocious accents.

8422822,5,B004C69GLM,"Wish Me Luck is one of those rare (for me) British made series or movies that don't come across as third rate (at best) in terms of acting, screenplay, sets or storyline. The language and dialogue are very easy to understand and although complex at times, remain simple to follow.

This series of almost stand alone episodes takes the viewer from the inception of the British womens' spy service through to the end of the war, it depicts very clearly the struggles they faced, not only from their enemies but also from their friends overseas, who were often less than likely to accept a woman as a leader especially in time of war.
It also is excellent at demonstrating the worries and concerns of those left at home, how a husband has to deal with a wife or mother putting herself in mortal danger, how he reacts when she chooses service to country over servitude at home and the fractures that are ever present between mothers and children.

The various episodes take the viewer expertly through the atrocities of the Third Reich, avoiding the most graphic representations, while leaving little to the imagination. One gets to experience almost firsthand the pressures of life as a female spy in occupied Europe, the ever present threat of capture, the friends posted missing or known killed, the panic and the joy, the love and sorrow are all sewn expertly into this vivid tapestry of life in WW2 Europe.

I bought the first series, followed quickly by the set, and will watch it many times over the comming years, as I actually found nothing that looked obviously ""fake"" or ""graphics generated"", or alerted the viewer strongly that this was a low budget effort and detracted from the series' main efforts to pull the watcher thoroughly into the period.",1290384000,16,1756,4.769736842105263
