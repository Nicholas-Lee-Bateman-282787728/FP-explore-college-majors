8566413,5,B00BCQZH04,"I have reviewed and read a number of articles and videos on Age-Related Macular Degeneration and this is by far the best set of educational videos I have come across.  It is the most updated information I have found.  You can listen to real patients share what they experienced when first diagnosed with the disease. Caregivers also share their experience in taking care of the AMD patient.  The  easy to understand interviews with eye doctors and retinal doctors are very helpful.  If you or someone you love has been diagnosed with this disease, I highly suggest that you consider purchasing these videos.",1367971200,,607,4.911764705882353
