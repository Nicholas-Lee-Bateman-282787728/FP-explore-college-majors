5334396,5,B009GXTG0C,"I made the mistake of buying ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" before I purchased the original version.  Horrible mistake!  It absolutely ruined my concept of the original film.  My husband and I cringed at the long drawn out French hide-away down the river and Sheen's sudden obsession with one of the French women and a 'quickie' interlude in the middle of the night.  Also, having the USO women performing as prostitutes on the side--really?!!!  Just an awful version of this truly great film and concept.  Do not waste your money on the Redux version and only get the original.  The original film is wonderful and riveting, without the cheap love affairs or additional superfluous garbage thrown in.",1438560000,31,692,4.965217391304348

5334399,5,B009GXTG0C,This is the ultimate version. Both the original and 'Redux' versions of the movie are included. This package also include the original aspect ratio of Apocalypse Now that hasn't been available since the Widescreen VHS release. You finally get to see all the expanded images former releases cut off on the edges. A plethora of extras round out the edition including the highly entertaining documentary Heart of Darkness on the making of the film. For fans of the movie this is hands down the best edition and presentation of the film on home video and should be purchased without hesitation.,1507248000,,590,4.91

5334403,5,B009GXTG0C,"This insanely magnificent film is a visual glory. I have watched it probably 50 times. Each time nuances show up that I didn't notice before. I like both versions included here. The documentary is also great.

Watch the color palette Coppola uses. Each scene has a particular color assigned to it. The farther you get into the film, the more the colors are indicators of what is happening. The tiger scene is dominated by blue.

Sheen is brilliant as Capt. Willard. Duvall and Brando get the accolades, deservedly so, but Sheen is the person guiding us on this trip into Cambodia. His performance is the one to watch. It is understated and mesmerizing. Coppola is a true eccentric genius. A film like this can never happen again.

I don't enjoy war films, but this is atypical. It can exhaust you with all that it asks of viewers, but it's a good tired, a satisfied one. This film helps you realize that filmmaking is a true art form.",1499990400,6,934,4.580838323353293

5334409,5,B009GXTG0C,"Yes, this is a 3 disc set. Yes, it has Apocalypse Now, Apocalypse Now Redux, and Hearts of Darkness, but those features do not take up one disc each. Both versions of Apocalypse Now are on Disc 1. These are the full versions, NOT broken up like they were on The Complete Dossier! Commentaries on the films. Disc 2 is Hearts of Darkness with commentary by Eleanor and Francis Ford Coppola as well as a storyboard gallery and marketing archive. I have not seen in either the product description or reviews about any special features. That's Disc 3. There are a lot of special features on here. I'm not going to list them all, but many of them were on The Complete Dossier, but there are a lot of new stuff on here too.

Major sound and video syncing problems in many scenes, especially the first meeting between Capt Willard, Gen Corman, and Col Lucas. That scene alone the sound was at least a full second early. Very irritating to watch and ruins the movie. Many scenes were like this. My OPPO BD-105 plays Blu-Ray disks beautifully and has never had a problem with any other disk except this one.

5334447,3,B009GXTG0C,"Marxists utilize the tactic of employing false oppositions, more commonly referred to by Marxists as the Scissors Strategy, in which the blades represent the two falsely opposed sides that converge on the confused victims, neutralizing true opposition, thereby allowing the advancement of socialism to the bewilderment of the true opposition. Relating to the Vietnam War, and as with all movies that deal with the conflict, in 'Apocalypse Now' you won't be informed that over 50% of North Vietnamese Army (NVA) regiments were actually 100% manned by Chinese soldiers attired in NVA uniforms, hence why the United States 'lost' the war. Of course, this means that the political parties of the West conspired to destroy the pre-eminence of the United States in the eyes of the world, where at home in the United States the never-ending war, thanks to Chinese soldier ringers, (1) brought about distrust between the American people and their government; and (2) secured Communist victories in Southeast Asia. Application of the 'Scissors Strategy' during the Vietnam War era witnessed the so-called 'hawks' vs. 'doves' false oppositions. Both communities based their war policy platforms on false precepts, thereby neutralizing closer examination of the war's oddities.

Only Marxists get to produce, direct and act in Hollywood, hence the distorted history. When did Hollywood produce a movie that documented the horrors of the Soviet Union or Communist China? In fact, Warren Beatty's 1981 movie 'Reds' embarrassingly romanticized Lenin & Bolsheviks, receiving rave reviews from the Hollywood establishment. Regarding the Vietnam War, where in John Wayne's Vietnam War movie, 'The Green Berets', were we informed about the Chinese soldiers American boys were fighting? That's one empirical example of the 'Scissors Strategy' tactic in action during the Vietnam War era, where 'hawks' misinformed movie goers.

For those who are ignorant of the above, the next time you meet a Vietnam veteran ask him who else besides the NVA, Viet Cong, Khmer Rouge (Cambodian Communists), and Pathet Lao (Laotian Communists) were United States ground forces fighting in Vietnam. Don't mention the word 'Chinese', however! Allow the veteran to volunteer it.

Notice that not one political party in the West requested verification of the collapse of the USSR, and the media failed to alert your attention to this fact, including the ""alternative"" media. When determining whether the ""former"" USSR is complying with arms control treaties, what does the United States do to confirm compliance? Right, the United States sends into the ""former"" USSR investigative teams to VERIFY compliance, yet when it's the fate of the West that's at stake should the collapse of the USSR be a ruse, what does the United States do to confirm the collapse? Nothing!

The fraudulent collapse of the USSR (and East Bloc) couldn't have been pulled off until both political parties in the United States (and political parties elsewhere in the West) were co-opted by Marxists, which explains why verification of the collapse was never undertaken by the West, such verification being (1) a natural administrative procedure (since the USSR wasn't occupied by Western military forces); and (2) necessary for the survival of the West. Recall President Reagan's favorite phrase, ""Trust, but verify"".

It gets worse--the ""freed"" Soviets and West also never (1) de-Communized the Soviet Armed Forces of its Communist Party officer corps, which was 90% officered by Communist Party members; and (2) arrested/de-mobilized the 6-million vigilantes that assisted the Soviet Union's Ministry of the Interior and police control the populations of the larger cities during the period of ""Perestroika"" (1986-1991)!

There can be no collapse of the USSR (or East Bloc nations) without...

Verification, De-Communization and De-mobilization.

The West never verified the collapse of the USSR because no collapse occurred, since if a real collapse had occurred the West would have verified it, since the survival of the West depends on verification. Conversely, this proves that the political parties of the West were co-opted by Marxists long before the fraudulent collapse of the USSR, since the survival of the West depends on verification.

The above means that the so-called ""War on Terror"" is an operation being carried out by the Marxist co-opted governments of the West in alliance with the USSR and other Communist nations, the purpose being to (1) destroy the prominence of the West in the eyes of the world, where the West is seen (i) invading nations without cause; (ii) causing chaos around the globe; and (iii) killing over one-million civilians and boasting of torture; (2) close off non-Russian supplies of oil for export, thereby increasing the price of oil, the higher price allowing oil exporting Russia to maintain economic stability while she modernizes and increases her military forces; (3) destroy the United States Armed Forces via the never-ending ""War on Terror""; the ultimate purpose of the aforementioned to (4) bring about the demise of the United States in the world, opening up a political void to be filled by a new pan-national entity composed of Europe and Russia (replacing the European Union), a union From the Atlantic to Vladivostok""; which will (5) see the end of NATO.

Now you know how Bolshevik Russia survived in 1917; how the West ""lost"" China to the Communists in 1949; why the Eisenhower administration turned a deaf ear to the anti-Communist Hungarian uprising in 1956; why the Eisenhower administration in 1959 was indifferent to the Castro brothers' Communist fidelity, actually used the CIA to overthrow the Batista government; why the Nixon administration abandoned Taiwan for Communist China, and signed treaties/provided economic aid to the USSR; why the Nixon administration refused to tell the American People that over 50% of North Vietnamese NVA regiments were actually Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers (attired in NVA uniforms, and proving that the Sino/Soviet Split was a ruse, as KGB defector Major Anatoliy Golitsyn told the West back in 1962), thereby (1) ensuring the Vietnam War would be lost; (2) destroying the prominence of the United States abroad and at home; (3) breeding distrust between the American people and their government; and (4) securing Communist victories in Southeast Asia. Working in the background within the political parties of the United States and Great Britain were Marxist agents doing their best to (1) ensure the survival of Communist nations when they popped up; and (2) sabotage any policies that would bring down a Communist nation. That's why after the fake collapses of the East Bloc nations and USSR there was no mandatory Western verification process to ensure the Communists weren't still in control.

Question: When did any Western nation liberate a Marxist nation? Ah, you never thought about that question, huh, and that's because the media/press never directed your attention to the giveaway proof of the West's Marxist co-option, since the answer to the question is the West liberated zero Marxist nations, while doing nothing to prevent their rise.

Conclusion:

The West will form new political parties where candidates are vetted for Marxist ideology, the use of the polygraph to be an important tool for such vetting. Then the West can finally liberate the globe of vanguard Communism.",1440720000,4,7444,5.325106382978723

8541363,5,B009GXTG0C,"The basic story is that Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who was sent to Vietnam (60s era) to correct a problem, now sees the problem differently and has exceeded his authority in the correction. Therefore Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) is dispatched to dispatch the colonel. In this Joseph Campbell (The Hero with a Thousand Faces) type adventure, he meets with many situations that help him grow and understand the problem that Colonel Kurtz faced. Will he complete his mission or succumb to the came forces as the colonel in the heart of darkness?

This is basically an updated version of Joseph Conrad's book ""Heart of Darkness"" with a lot Francis Ford Coppola thrown in. The location is Viet Nam, instead of Africa, and as with any update; they thought it would be more relevant than trying to explain the Congo. Toss in some songs from the 60s era (The Best of the Doors- The End), and some classics (Wagner - ""Die Walkure: Ride of the Valkyries""), and you have a movie. Too bad it is not that easy.

I would not worry too much whether this looks like Vietnam or if certain events really take place, as that is not the point of the picture or the intent of the story telling. The feel of the book was conveyed. And I would not worry if it does not match the book story word for word as this is a different media. If you come away with the question ""what would I do if it were me?"" it worked.

Not to distract from the movie review, however I was in Viet Nam (1967-1968) in an armed reconnaissance organization. And the Vietnam I was in did not have the surrealistic scenes. We did get to see Bob Hope and Martha Ray ""The Big Broadcast of 1938"" (1938). Before that I always thought it was a bunch of hype. However it did make a difference having them take the time to go there. So I could see something as weird as the bunny scene happening.

Besides the movie there are the Scenes of the destruction of the Kurtz compound set. They were required to clean up after the movie was made. Coppola says that these scenes were removed from the end of the movie so people did not think that it was part of the story. However I saw this on TV and they left the scenes in and I did think it was part of the story.

Another movie interpretation of, ""Heart of Darkness"" was made later. Not quite as moving as Apocalypse Now, but you should see it to compare to the original, Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death (1988). Adrienne Barbeau is Dr. Kurtz.",1510876800,,2463,4.380743982494529
