2702647,5,B000LC4ZDA,"The Sun Also Rises  DVD

The Sun Also Rises  is based on the novel by that name by the Master Earnest Hemingway.  It is one of his earliest novels about the Lost Generation in Europe post World War I, or the War to End All Wars as it was known at the time.  It stars Tyrone Powers and Ava Gardner.

More cerebral than action oriented.

Recommended for Hemingway fans.

2702648,4,B000LC4ZDA,"I saw this movie a long time ago on TV and am glad they finally put it on DVD.  And although it is not one of the best movies it reflects the time period of the ""lost generation"" as chronicle by Hemingway and acted out by some of the best actors of our time.  I bought the DVD to mostly see the performances of Errol Flynn and Eddie Albert who are really the best in this film. I gave it four stars as it comes up a little short as a great movie but nevertheless entertaining.",1197072000,4,476,3.9479166666666665
2702649,3,B000LC4ZDA,"Unfortunately, this is not the best vehicle to see the best talents of Tyrone Power, Ava Gardner and Errol Flynn. The story line revolves around the ""Lost Generation"" of young people during the post World War One era. In their middle forties at the time of filming, Tyrone Power and Errol Flynn are clearly too old for their parts. However, it's great to see both of these former matinee idols together on film; albeit just shortly before each of them died.
Also, it loses something being viewed on a television set. I'm sure it was quite spectacular in CinemaScope in the theatre, especially the bullfighting scenes. I would recommend this film if you are a fan of the stars or a fan of bullfighting but not if you are a fan of Ernest Hemingway.",1183939200,2,746,4.574626865671642
2702650,4,B000LC4ZDA,"Many reviews of this film like to take issue with its meandering, aimless plot that starts anywhere and leads nowhere.  The bad news is that criticism is spot on.  The good news is that's the point exactly.  You see, Hemingway is trying to show what happens to the first generation that loses its faith in reason, science, and progress.  Instead of perfecting society, humanity, and the world, these ideals have only led to more effective, more efficient ways of killing our neighbors on a global scale.  How to live when there is nothing left to believe in?  Watch this film and find out!  Ask yourself, are these characters so different from you and me?  Tyrone Power is impotent.  So are we.  Wealth, fame, power -- our worldly pleasures are insatiable.  Errol Flynn is a hopeless drunk.  Our pleasures are also unfulfilling.  Ava Gardner is an aging beauty.  Even when a few of us manage to attain our worldly desires, they are fleeting, we just can't hold on to them.  This film is more relevant today than it ever was.  If you hit yourself on the head with a book, and you hear a hollow sound, it doesn't always mean the book is empty.",1183593600,36,1141,4.54679802955665

Don't miss Flynn and Eddie Albert actually running through the streets and into the bull ring with the dudes of ""Pamplona"" (filmed in Mexico) Two guys get gored!  Ava G. is as sensual as ever, whether in a Parisian bistro or flirting with a matador.  Location is a huge part of the novel, and this movie gets is right.
The movie falls far short of the reckless desperation of the novel, and Tyronne P. is a soul-less Jake, but that would be a tough role for anyone to play.",1182729600,2,491,4.258064516129032
2702652,2,B000LC4ZDA,"THE SUN ALSO RISES is a handsomely produced, but ultimately pointless film. It serves as yet another example of how Hemingway's work rarely translates onto the silver screen. Tyrone Power, Ava Gardner (beginning to look bloated from excessive drinking), Errol Flynn (the poster child of bloatedness from excessive drinking), and Eddie Albert (bloated, but not from alcohol) play a bunch of literate types who lounge about various western European locales drinking (not much of a stretch for Gardner and Flynn here) and moping and whining. Each male character increases his drinking, moping, and whining when left by Gardner for another male rival. This more or less describes what drags on over the course of 2+ hours. The real stars here are the European scenery and Cinemascope, which captures and conveys the grandeur and glory of the film's setting. Other than that, the only other value of the movie is the vivid illustration it provides of why Robert Evans' acting career was so short lived. His open-mouthed, blank stares while waiting for the bull charges almost inadvertently redeem this bland flick. To some extent, watching THE SUN ALSO RISES might be a case of life imitating art, since it will likely inspire its audience to drink, mope, and whine after enduring its pointlessness.",1177200000,8,1294,5.1084905660377355
2702653,3,B000LC4ZDA,"""The Sun Also Rises"" was 20th Century Fox's big-budget 'prestige' film

for 1957, based on Ernest Hemingway's first novel, shot on location in Paris and Mexico (substituting for Spain), and starring the studio's long-reigning superstar, Tyrone Power, surrounded by legendary actors (Ava Gardner, Errol Flynn, Mel Ferrer, and Eddie Albert). With all the talent assembled in front of and behind the camera, producer Darryl F. Zanuck felt confident that the film would be an enduring classic for both his own independent company, and his studio.

It wasn't, unfortunately...

The film's problem was a fundamental one; the 'Lost Generation'

Hemingway wrote of were disillusioned young Americans, who, shattered

by the horror and brutality of the 'Great War', lost their innocence, and became a 'live fast, die young' crowd of expatriates, settling in Paris. These were men and women still in their twenties and thirties...yet the film's stars were all ten to twenty years older! The most glaring case can be seen in the film's star, Tyrone Power. As newspaperman Jake Barnes, a vet whose war injuries render him impotent, unable to satisfy the woman he loves (Ava Gardner), and, therefore, the 'perfect' observer of her romantic entanglements with other men, Power seems more a victim of a midlife crisis than a young man devastated about losing his manhood. In his next-to-last film, Power, at 44, was aging badly, his hair thinning and his slender, 'movie idol' good looks surrendering to a middle-aged paunch. Only when he smiles do the years seem to lift, a bit, and the ""too handsome to be true"" younger man appears. Adding to his physical deterioration was an undiagnosed heart condition, which would kill him, in less than two years.

His co-star, Ava Gardner, at 35, was going through a decline, as well, but, like her character, Lady Brett Ashley, her vices were the cause of her self-destruction. Both Brett and Ava were hedonistic women too fond of booze, bullfighters, and nightlife, and Ava's once-classic features were beginning to develop bags and wrinkles that makeup and lighting couldn't hide.

Coming off best are Errol Flynn and Eddie Albert. Flynn, at 48, long past his 'glamorous' prime (he and Power had been Hollywood's best-looking 'swashbucklers' of the early 40s), had become a very credible character actor, usually portraying variations of himself. His 'Mike Campbell', an alcoholic, impoverished but clinging to his pride, was, sadly, a dead-on assessment of Errol Flynn, as well. Like Power, he would be dead in two years, a victim of his own excesses. On the other hand, Eddie Albert, at 49, had long been health-conscious, and his performance as a drunk was simply good acting; paired with Flynn, they 'steal' the film, particularly during the famous Pamplona bull run, when the duo flee for their lives (while guzzling wine), and Flynn attempts to use a bad check as a cape to 'fight' a bull!

The drama seems overdrawn, the romance lacks 'fire', Robert Evans as a young bullfighter is dreadful, and the resolution is a hollow one. Even with the gorgeous scenery, Hugo Friedhofer's soaring film score, and Henry King's skill as a director, the film fails to generate more than a curiosity value, at the sight of so many actors, past their prime, trying to seem youthful and dynamic.

The DVD offers many 'added features', including 'behind the scenes' photos of Power, Flynn, and Gardner, and director Henry King's audio reminiscences of the production, possibly more entertaining than the feature, itself.

All-in-all, an ambitious misfire!",1175212800,84,3573,5.123711340206185

2702770,4,B000LC4ZDA,"This film shows that 1957 vintage film and color technology can still hold up quite well on today's big HDTVs.  I bought the DVD right after reading Hemingway's novel, his first big hit.  The author had done his Paris friends a nasty trick by trashing them in roman-a-clef fashion, but comparing the book and the film was interesting.  The film stripped away the author's nearly incessant antisemitic jibes against one character, and also made a very big goof by casting Ava Gardner as the novel's titled but promiscuous British female love interest.

Thinking it over, I decided Maggie Smith (she of the very posh accent, and in 1957 herself a very tasty dish) would have been much more faithful casting.  Ava was herself famously promiscuous by nature, but only Maggie could have delivered the effect of a proper British ""lady"" sleeping around.  No wonder the author didn't like the film.

Most of the film was shot in Mexico, but includes 2nd-unit footage from the actual ""running of the bulls"" in Pamplona.  Worth seeing.",1362182400,,1025,4.884393063583815

In his penultimate screen role, an aging Tyrone Power comes across as a total stiff. Making matters worse, the Production Code toned down the lustful passion of Ava Gardner's Lady Brett. Even screenwriter Peter Viertel was dissatisfied with the final result. Worth a look for Leo Tover's CinemaScope locations and Errol Flynn's splendid ""comeback"" performance as the alcoholic Mike Campbell.",1349654400,2,521,5.766233766233766
2702776,5,B000LC4ZDA,"I am very surprised by the number of negative reviews of this movie. This really is an outstanding movie based on a great book. I think people often miss the meaning behind this movie and to some extent the book. It is a slow moving plot. No one would argue that. But that is not the point. The movie and the book are focused on life and how we live our lives and are affected by different events in our life.  The lead character is grappling with his impotence caused by the war and cannot seem to bring himself to accept it. Because of his impotence he feels that he is not worthy of the love of his life and tries to hide from her. But she is deeply in love with him and seeks him out even though she is sometimes oblivious to her own feelings . Underlying this main theme are a number of other themes dealing with the impact of war on people and the adoption of different lifestyles caused by the impact of different events such as war etc. The movie really captures all of these themes quite well.

Tyrone Power is outstanding in the lead role. He really captures the mental suffering that his character experiences as a result of his impotence. In my view Tyrone Power was an extremely underrated actor based perhaps on the fact he had to accept a number of lighter roles which affected critics' perceptions of him. He is tremendous in this role. He really captures the agony of his situation and the depression he is battling which is another sub-theme that was close to Hemingway's heart. Ava Gardner is also extremely good in this and captures all of the aspects of her character's frustrations, instability and recklessness. The interactions between Power and Gardner are tremendous but they are subtle and nuanced. You really have to work when you watch this movie or read the book. The movie is not in your face. It is very subtle and deep and moving and you have to work to understand its meaning and themes. As everyone agrees Errol Flynn is magnificent in this. Once again this is an example of a very underrated actor. This movie is also about the unfairness of life and how we must all deal with the impact of events on us and make the best of our lives even though we might feel that we have been dealt with unfairly . This is a great movie that will stay with you long after you have watched it. Also, it is based on a very underrated Hemingway book.",1347667200,3,2369,4.381818181818182
2702797,2,B000LC4ZDA,"Earnest Hemingway penned the novel that inspired this rather pointlessly dull film about four men infatuated with one woman, wasting away in 1920's Paris.  Despite being beautifully shot and effectively acted, especially by an intoxicated Errol Flynn and his screen buddy Eddie Albert, this film is just slow and redundant and offers very little point.  The character interactions meander on vapid and the way the film is constructed bogs down the viewer with boredom and nonsensical character development.  Tyrone Power and Ava Gardner phone this one in, delivering emotionally restrained performances that don't say as much as they think they do, and Mel Ferrer gives an atrocious performance as the unstable and somewhat thick-headed Robert Cohn.  I wanted to punch him square in the face throughout most of the film.  Still, it is sensationally lit and offers some beautiful cinematography, and the underlying storyline of a wounded war vet (emotionally and physically) and his love for a woman who he could never please is compelling, just not conveyed in the most effective way.  And my lord, I never thought that bull fighting could appear so dull, but those scenes were awfully un-thrilling and sleep inducing; and I watched this in the middle of the day!",1346284800,,1263,5.136585365853659
2702798,1,B000LC4ZDA,"It's hard to make a movie about people and situations that are themselves boring, aimless, meandering..  So what, as one reviewer said,if the characters have traits that most of us may share in part? This movie is a superficial script by the numbers that reveals nothing about anyone. Why sit through 2 hours of pointless boredom, just for the author and stars attached?

The dialogue is the most boring I've ever heard in a movie. The writers must have put themselves to sleep. It's insulting to an audience.  I was struck by the pointless repetition of scenes like the following, which is the most repetitive, meaningless series of scenes I've ever seen.

A couple get out of a cab--no, 1st they hail a cab, after debating where to go--I left that out! The driver takes them, and then tells Power how much the fare is, he pays the driver, the driver says merci, the couple turn away from the cab, and go into a nightclub or restaurant, they pause and look around, they sit down, they order the same drink that they had in the last place, they see friends, they talk briefly, they leave. They go to another place, the driver tells them the fare, they pay the cab, he says merci, they enter restaurant and pause, get seated by maitre d, give order to waiter-a similar  drink, they talk about nothing....pointless dialogue on and on.
Readers, are you still awake?

I couldn't wait anymore. I turned it off. I'm sure I missed a lot! No wonder TCM never showed this until now, and with these stars yet. Reqires fascination with the actors or Hemingway's lost souls to care. Gee, I'm getting sleepy just thinking about it...zzzzz.",1345852800,4,1626,4.628472222222222
2702799,4,B000LC4ZDA,"I've always heard the expression ""The Lost Generation"" but had never seen it up close on the screen. I don't agree with those who think the stars are too old for their roles. I'm amazed at the number of reviewers who actually believe that the characters in the book were ""in their 20s"". Perhaps they listened to the commentary on this film rather than reading the book. The book plainly states that Brett Ashley and Robert Cohn are both 34 years old and Jake was at least that old, probably older and physically aged by having been in the Great War and his physical and emotional sufferings. We have to realize that in that period of time 34 years old was much older than it is now. And, these people had led drifting, pointless, alcohol soaked lives for several years.  To me, Tyrone Power is incapable of giving a bad performance in any role where he is cast as a sensitive, rather unhappy man. And, Ava Gardner was probably the only actress at the time who could portray a woman driven by her love for a man and her inability to accept his physical limitations. Realizing that sex is more important to you than being with the man you love must be a disturbing thing leading to more and more alcohol consumption. I think it is her self awareness that drives her so relentlessly. Errol Flynn, God Bless Him, had only to play himself.  Jose Ferrer is excellent in a difficult, thankless role with many shadings. I do find fault with the direction of the film. I think it moves too slowly in many places relying too heavily on location and spectacle to hold one's interest. But, perhaps it's aim was to show the utter boredom and listlessness of the lives of people trying to somehow manufacture interesting lives for themselves and failing miserably. There is nothing sadder than people ""trying to have a good time"". I think it is a very good depiction of ""The Lost Generation"".",1342224000,2,1878,4.553254437869822

2702801,3,B000LC4ZDA,"Hollywood has some aging stars trying to recapture the emotional conflicts of their youth. In addition to bullfighting, this movie has one woman trying to find a suitable mate, several men who are writers in unsatisfactory times, and mostly some nightlife in which a fight breaks out amid the dancing, drinking, and smoking. The major character in the movie keeps providing money. Errol Flynn plays a character whose bankruptcy was gradual and then sudden, likely to keep moving to someplace where he still has credit. Hemingway's book, The Sun Also Rises, was about younger people, but only the bullfighter seems young in the movie. If Hemingway had been writing for the Bible, there would be more about Hosea and Samson.",1306195200,2,722,5.025
2702802,5,B000LC4ZDA,"How can a movie be fascinating without a plot? Watch The Sun Also Rises and you'll find out. I admire the courage of the filmmakers for their faithfulness to Hemingway's work, which was a challenge to translate for the screen. The novel is really a slice of life in which character study takes precedence over story. This is about the so-called ""lost"" generation of people who try without success to find some meaning in their lives after the horrors of the First World War. As a theme, it has enormous relevance even today.

If you dissect this film, what you have is one scene, the same scene, repeated over and over and over: The actors order drinks, smoke cigarettes, and engage in witty dialogue. In an outdoor caf, in a restaurant, in a bar, in an apartment, in a hotel, in Paris, in Pamplona, in ... are you getting the picture? But don't despair, this is an absolutely fascinating movie despite the fact that nothing really happens. How can that be? First, Hemingway's characters are interesting as hell. Second, Henry King was a brilliant director and put his stamp on every aspect of this production. Third, the Cinemascope photography of Paris and Spain (or Mexico) is staggering. The scenes in Paris during the first part of the film made me want to get on an airplane. And fourth, these were superb film actors at the top of their form.

Tyrone Power was a highly underrated actor. In this film he has one of the most difficult roles for any actor, playing a character who is depressed all the time. Actors like to play active motivations. Playing depressed is about as difficult as it can get for an actor and Power is superb in playing dour without losing his natural charm. Mel Ferrer is perfectly cast as the droopy Robert Cohn, who is both likeable and hateful. Juliette Greco positively jumps off the screen in a small part at the beginning of the film. Even the way she says a single word, yes, is exciting. Eddie Albert, another underrated actor, is great in a part that would have confounded a lesser actor. The real surprise is Errol Flynn, appearing here in a character role at the end of his career and short life. He is hysterical as a drunk among drunks (they are all drunk) and steals every scene he's in. During the bull running scenes in Pamplona, Flynn and Albert are wonderful at the kind of physical comedy that Peter Sellers would have admired. I even liked Robert Evans' portrayal of a Spanish bullfighter and don't understand why everyone makes fun of his acting.

But the heart of the film is stolen by another underrated actor, Ava Gardner, who gives the performance of a lifetime as the disturbed Lady Brett Ashley. Gardner nails every aspect of this complicated personality and in most scenes she is able to convey an incredible variety of emotional states. I loved one scene in the Cafe Select in which she switches from wild abandon to serious concern and back again in a matter of seconds. And on top of it all, she is drop dead gorgeous as few actresses have ever been. Even her own dissipation as she approached middle age works for the part. What a pleasure to watch her in this movie! I find it bizarre that, in one of the special features, some hack critic suggests that Gardner was miscast.

At the end of The Sun Also Rises, I found myself saying, ""So what the hell just happened?"" I'm not entirely certain, but it simply makes me want to watch it over and over. This is a truly great film.",1294358400,24,3440,4.561488673139158
2702803,3,B000LC4ZDA,"The main actors here are all 10 to 15 years older - at least - than they should be, according to the 1926 Hemingway book about young soldiers in Paris and Spain shortly after WWI when they were all in their early 20s. Besides the absurd age mistake, the acting is uniformly stiff and lame, typical 1950s stuff when Hollywood somehow made the most American of actors like Ava Gardner speak in an absurd vaguely British accent. Why? Having recently read the Hemingway masterpiece upon which this 1957 film was based, I was disappointed by its lack of fidelity to the writing and tone that Hemingway conveyed. That said, the sets are interesting, and the colors and costuming are great. The DVD restoration looks spectacular in 1080 on a 40 inch LCD screen. Unless you are fan of Hollywood stuff from the 50s - I am not - you may be a bit bored by this silly adaptation of one of the great novels.",1292284800,4,894,4.4573170731707314
2702804,2,B000LC4ZDA,"This is one of my favorite books of all time.  I recorded the movie from HBO and watched it and immediately saw some huge issues.  The first was the casting.  Several of the actors were many years older than they were in the book.  The main actor that played Jake was 40+.  It simply didn't work.  It's odd that they didn't use younger actors because they followed much of the storyline, and even the dialog, closely.
If you are a fan of the book you may want to watch this movie, but don't go out of your way.  I still think this is a great story and would like to see someone make a new movie from this book.",1282694400,3,610,4.07563025210084
2702805,4,B000LC4ZDA,"I was interested in watching this movie since I had read the book when I was a teen. The book was written by Ernest Hemingway. Because of censorship rules not everything from the book was able to be put forth on the screen. Watching the special features reminded me of this fact.

Special Features include:
* The Old Men and The Bulls: The Making of ""The Sun Also Rises""
* Hemingway on Film
* A Conversation with Director Henry King

The main character actors are some pretty well known and respected persons: Ava Gardner (Lady Brett Ashley), Tyrone Power (Jake Barnes), Errol Flynn (Mike Campbell), Mel Ferrer (Robert Cohn), and Eddie Albert (Bill Gorton).

It is over two hours. The pace seemed pretty good - kept me interested. There's drama and romance and adventure. The story's backdrop is Paris and Spain. It includes the running of the bulls and some bull fighting.

We picked up this Studio Classic as part of a 4 disc set celebrating the 75th anniversary of 20th Century Fox.",1275177600,9,985,4.676300578034682
2702806,1,B000LC4ZDA,"Miscast, misdirected, badly written, this is the worst movie ever made, especially when you consider the brilliance of Hemmingway's book of the same title.

The characters as protrayed in the film do not match the characters in the book, the sets are laughable, the dialog almost worse. By the time Errol Flynn comes in as Micheal, you're not only cringing but feeling sorry for the actors.  Especially Flynn. If you did not know the book, you would not catch key references nor would you understand the motivations or the actions of the characters.  Skip this movie and read the book.",1264032000,6,585,4.83

8161069,5,B000LC4ZDA,"A real cinematic masterpiece, with complex characters adrift in Europe in the wake of the First World War.

Those looking for a by-the-numbers story, Hollywood stereotypes, clichs & cardboard characters should look elsewhere. This is Hemingway's literary magnum opus done as well as humanly possible for the screen.

Everything about this film is superlative. A great cast, with a surefooted Power carrying the movie with depth & nuance; and especially Flynn, in perhaps the best role of his career, practically stealing every scene he's in. The locations are magnificent, the cinematography flawless, finely directed, and a wonderful script that does justice to Hemingway's novel as well as could be done in a movie. If anything, it will make you want to read the book.

The bull fight scenes are entirely real and thrilling, but his is not an action flick. Most of the action here takes place between the lines, inside the characters, who wrestle with Gordian dilemmas of life & death, love & loss and how to go on in a world devastated by war, tragedy & meaninglessness. Yet despite it's timeless themes, it isn't ponderous or depressing. It's haunting.

In the end, it's all in there in title: The Sun Also Rises.",1516752000,,1217,4.950980392156863

8161075,5,B000LC4ZDA,"This DVD is the best reproduction yet of the great 20th Century Fox film that visualized the story line of Ernest Hemmingway's, ""The Sun Also Rises"".  The quality of the transfer to video is fine, and the DVD makes the film available to a new generation that would not likely have been around to see the original 1957 release of the theatrical film.  The DVD captures Fox's CinemaScope aspect ratio and the viewer can enjoy, either once again, or at long last, the faithful retelling of one of Hemmingway's greatest short novels.  The ensemble cast, selected by producer Daryl Zanuck, turn in superb performances, and what more could one ask of the rerelease, on video, of a great classic film.  It's still a great story and a compelling insight into what has been called ""The Lost Generation"".",1482796800,3,794,4.773722627737226
