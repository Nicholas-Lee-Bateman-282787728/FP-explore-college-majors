8167573,5,B000MAT6MQ,This movie is a heart warmer! the love that the father-in-law has for his daughter-in-law is pure joy to watch/  Amitabh Bachchan makes you believe in every emotion and feeing that this movie displays.  The love the father has for his son is poured into his daughter-in-law.  don't want to give the story away but this is the kind of warmth and love for family that Bollywood displays so well.  I am in love with the way they tell a story so heartfelt and fun at the same time.  You have to see this movie.  If you want to learn the culture and the way they can be together and yet allow each other to grow this is a must see.,1478736000,,626,4.132231404958677

8167577,5,B000MAT6MQ,"Amitiji, John and Rani killed it in this movie. S. Khan is not one of my favorite Hindi actors but even he did a great job. This movie really draws you in and you find yourself lost in the grief the family feels. Wonderful!",1398988800,,223,4.090909090909091
8167578,2,B000MAT6MQ,It says right on the DVD that the maximum retail price is 45 rupees.  That's under a dollar US.  45.00 INR  = 0.736152 USD.  This is a scam.  It doesn't even come in a normal DVD case.  It was in an envelope.,1398297600,,208,3.8333333333333335

8167580,4,B000MAT6MQ,"Mothers and their enduring, sacrificial love have long been celebrated in Indian films. In Baabul, fathers get a turn at admiration. The title is a Hindi term of affection used by daughters for their dads. However, the film starts out as a story about a father and son who are best friends--Balraj (played by Amitabh Bachchan) and Avi (Salman Khan). Avi falls in love with an artist named Milli (Rani Mukerji) and marries her. Although Avi is pretty cheesy and his courtship of Milli saccharine sweet, he's so smitten with her, so devoted to his dad, and eventually so attentive to his own son, that you can't help but like the guy. When the story takes a sharp turn halfway through the film, we learn the extent of Balraj's paternal love, this time for his daughter-in-law, as he goes to great lengths--at the expense of tradition and his family's sense of honor--to ensure her happiness. The main actors--all giants in the Hindi film industry--are at their charismatic best. Baabul is a melodramatic masterpiece and a tribute to selfless fatherhood. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1254009600,3,1286,5.6
8167581,2,B000MAT6MQ,"I didn't care all that much for this movie.  Its a superficial look at being a widow and remarriage.  Unless you are a fan of the actors I'd give this one a pass.

As far as performances I really can't say too much positive about any of them. Bachchan has played this role a million times before and has done so better.  Rani doesn't have the depth or the sensitivity to portray these types of characters. My opinion of her performance here is the same as with KANK.  I don't find myself sympathizing with her characters despite the bucketfull of tears she's shed in both roles.  Salman was playing Salman. Seriously, why do directors keep casting him. His relationship with Rani's character had zero credibility with me.  John Abraham was okay but besides looking good, he really doesn't bring much to the character.  He can't even dance and that's a no no when your a Bollywood actor.

Overall, this movie was one big dull experience.",1173312000,3,936,4.624242424242424
8167582,4,B000MAT6MQ,"This movie actually gets 3 and a  stars.  The first hour and a half of the movie is spent just getting Rani Mukherjee and Salman Khan married.  Before marriage, Rani Mukherjee plays this stuffy, rude and uptight character. But for some reason, we are supposed to think her character is cute.  I don't think if someone was going to marry me and they called my Dad a ""sanki buda"" (senile old man) it would be cute at all.  But after marriage, her character improves.  There is even no conflict in this movie until the last 15 minutes, and even that gets solved in this unconvincing 5 minute speech.  John Abraham is average, so is Salman Khan.  Hema Malini's voice drags in some areas and Amitabh Bachan does a pretty good job overall. The good thing about this movie is that it was light hearted and nice to watch. But it does not really have a story or any situation.",1172188800,,867,4.408805031446541
