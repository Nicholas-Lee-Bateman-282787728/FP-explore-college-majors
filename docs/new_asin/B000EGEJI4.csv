2518011,5,B000EGEJI4,"Good show. John Wells has done a better job with it lately.

It's too bad NBC cancelled it. This show will be loved for long time.

And to the reviewer at the top of the page, the Bush administration is not a corrupt joke. Or at least, no more so than the Clinton administration.",1140393600,17,279,4.148148148148148
2518012,4,B000EGEJI4,"This season started off a little over the top, and perhaps too melodramatic. However, by mid season, the producers and writer rightly so, changed direction and put the campaigns of the next election into the mix.

I would give the overall season 3 stars, but the third of the season that brought Alan Alda into the spotlight as the Republican candidate, elevated the show to 4 stars just by his talent, skill and charisma. The man is great in everything he does, and can even make Republicans appealing again in a common sense sort of way without the radical idiocy that they latch onto today.

It was always said that West Wing started out to be a fictional ideal of what people had hoped Clinton would be as a Dem in the White House. Alda, represents what a REAL Republican could be. I think that had the series continued, Alda would have won and given people who watched a reason to sit back and say, ""My God, why can't we have that in the oval office and not this corrupt joke we currently have."" Alda would have continued the original mission Sorkin started.

I can't wait to own this and season 7, just for Alan Alda. He alone makes it worth it.",1140307200,52,1151,4.419811320754717
2518013,3,B000EGEJI4,". . . a far cry from the first four.

As has been much mentioned and debated in reviews at this website of the 5th season, all West Wing seasons after the first four (after which series creators Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme who had created the distinctive tone of the show were shown the exit by NBC) have to be considered as almost a completely different show. Even when thought of in this way, the 5th season was something of a disaster, both ratings-wise and creatively.

So this 6th season really had nowhere else to go but up. Yet, more than just going up, by mid-season the series started to hit a bit of a stride and find a new voice (whether you prefer it to the first four seasons is debatable -- personally I do not -- but at least it was watchable and good for what it was). This is the season in which the narrative of the show fractures, as most of the characters exit their original roles and take on new assignments. This includes C.J.'s unrealistic promotion from press secretary to Chief of Staff (quite an improvement for a character who didn't know what the census was for in the first season and is now the President's chief adviser on all policy issues), Josh leaving the White House to manage the presidential campaign of Rep. Matt Santos (unevenly played by Jimmy Smitts), Donna quitting the White House to work on the Vice-President's campaign, Toby doubling as press secretary, Charlie becoming a Special Assistant for C.J., and Leo becoming general wise man for the White House, with no real role except to recover from his heart attack.

The first part of the season deals with the Arab-Israeli peace talks and the aftermath of the death of Admiral Fitzwallace and Donna's injuries in the Gaza Strip. Concluding with a bitter fight between Leo and the President that leads to the aforementioned heart attack by Leo (a sadly prescient plot line given John Spencer's real life death last year from a heart attack) and C.J.'s elevation, this segment segues  into the meat of the season, which is the Democratic Primary Season. While providing many interesting campaign episodes and plotlines as a result (an area the show didn't really explore as much when Bartlet ran for re-election), it also means that the amount of screen time for most characters is drastically reduced as the show rushes to cover so many different long-term plotlines. Moreover, the fragmented storytelling also de-emphasizes the West Wing part of ""The West Wing,"" except mainly to do national security issues to give an excuse to include stories for the totally uninteresting character of Mary McCormack (involving Cuba and Castro and whatnot). Why they wasted so much screen time on her stories is beyond me. More interesting in her addition to the cast is Kristen Chenowith as Asst. Press Secretary Annabeth Schott, who becomes an even better character in Season 7.

The final part of the season deals with the Republican challenger, Senator Arnold Vinick (certainly the most interesting and complex character introduced in the post-Sorkin era and very appealingly played by Alan Alda) and ends with a chaotic Democratic Convention that leaves Leo as the surprise VP candidate to (surprise) Jimmy Smitt's character managed by Josh. The season also ends with a ripped from the headlines storyline involving the leak by a West Wing staffer of sensitive national security information . . . all leading to Season 7 -- the final season of the series and certainly the best season since the first 4.

Overall, the season isn't bad and has a narrative drive created by the election season that helps sustain interest even when individual plotlines fizzle here and there. While the dialogue is a pale ghost of what it was, some of the campaign situations are interesting to ponder and several bit campaign players acquit themselves nicely. If you're still buying West Wing DVDs at this point, then this season isn't a bad buy (certainly much more worthwhile than the previous season in which you swear your favorite characters are possessed by pod people) but Season 7 is really the season to wait to purchase.",1139270400,215,4106,4.8418803418803416
2518014,5,B000EGEJI4,"Ok,  these are not the Sorkin years. But, to my surprise I came to like them more.  My apologies if I mix up Season 6 and 7. They blur together in one long story arc. Season 6 is the primary campaign. Season 7 is the national campaign.

But, they are not about the West Wing. The gang busts up. Leo has a heart attack and is replaced by CJ. Yes, Allison Janney pulls that off magnificently.  Sadly Tobey becomes a 2-D character. Josh and Donna go off to support different campaigns.  The West Wing is just background now.

The best is the introduction of Matt Santos supported by Josh. They take on all comers including the VP with Donna at his side.  And don't forget magnificent Alan Alda as a Republican candidate.  The series launches heavily into primary politics, conventions, etc. While I hate politics they manage to dredge up hope, idealism, and the fervor people used to feel.  And the experience is worth watching in this fantasy West Wing world that is so much better than the real thing.",1503100800,,1000,4.511111111111111

Although the dialogue was still very good (not at the Sorkin level, though), the characters changed into monsters.  (Josh and Toby duking it out in Season 6 was downright ugly and totally out of character for these guys.  The new writing staff obviously knows very little about East coast elitist Jewish boys.  Remember season 4 when Joshua Malina said: ""A Jewish guy in a bar brawl -- now, that's news!""

Everything was ""wrong"" character-wise.  And the humor, which was a hallmark of the first 4 seasons, was nil.  Whereas the first 4 years were about loyalty and smarts, Seasons 5 and 6 were about -- I don't know -- just one bummer after another.

2518061,1,B000EGEJI4,"Any movie recorded in English and packed with machine-gun dialogue should provide English subtitles, especially when the soundtrack is overwhelmed by background noise. And I am not hard of hearing. For their unwillingness to spend a few bucks to subtitle the sixth-year episodes of The West Wing, I give them one star. In the Camp David episodes, the sound of the great outdoors (and visually, this outdoor, rustic setting truly is great) makes the understanding of many sentences and the comprehension of many complex situations difficult. In some of the outdoor Camp David scenes, for example, noisy rain obliterates essential parts of dialogue. French and Spanish subtitles, on the other hand, are provided.

Half of Aaron Sorkins genius was his ability to integrate convincing, logically appropriate humor with the far more serious aspects of his stories, however grim the stories might be. In real life, humor abounds, even in painful circumstances. John Wells rarely employs humor in his WW scripts. And if Sorkin developed his characters through wit, subtlety, finesse, doubt, courage, regretwith occasional outbursts of angerWells leans more toward anger, fury, and even rage. Sorkin created three-dimensional characters, and Wells tends more toward two, as do most script writers in this millenium.

The tiresome and annoying reverse-tracking shots through the hallways of the west wing of the White Housethe so-called walk-and-talk shotshave been eliminated, at least in what I've seen so far. Sincere thanks to whatever person made that wise decision.",1431993600,,1562,5.450413223140496

Sadly, after Sorkin left the Wells team made a solid effort but couldn't match Sorkin's wit and drama.

It's a tough, tough thing to pick up where and Oscar/Tony/Emmy winning writer left off and was pretty much doomed for any staff of crackerjack writers.

2518121,5,B000EGEJI4,I like the fast-paced storyline. The characters are well-developed. I'm close to the end of the videos have three to watch but it seems as though the series is going to end by placing all the characters in believable situations.  And happy endings.

Bartlet has lost many of his key advisors and is struggling to manage his MS and to create a lasting legacy for his tenure as POTUS.

It has all the emotional punch and some romantic attachments that you are so sure won't happen (but wish they would)......may be all works their way to an ending to cheer for (or cry for).  This late teens to adult series is so worth watching.  You can really learn a lot about the political process and who does what in the White House.  I enjoyed the West Wing and the supurb acting.

2518142,2,B000EGEJI4,"one of the huge dramatic problems with the series is that it is heavily, ham-handedly didactic. the scripts are tethered to the predictable political, social and religious prejudices of the writers. the dialogue often shows subtlety and wit but not the views that are emphatically advocated.  in this particular episode, vinnick's blast at the Bible is the product of his own smug self-indulegence and his intellectual laziness and it is predicated upon his ignorance.  bartlett is not much help. he, a man of superior intellect, goes to church and is a believer but is allowed by the writers no effective retort to vinnick.",1398556800,,624,5.048543689320389

2518148,4,B000EGEJI4,"It's difficult to sustain such a high level of writing over so many seasons when you're dealing with a linear story (as opposed to an episodic one). The fix for this problem on the WW is that each week will bring another crisis.  The thematic crisis over the season is a rather depressive one: the characters at the top are falling apart.  They're aging, turning on each other, becoming disabled (how incredibly sad that the plot point of Leo's heart attack predated the actual heart retaliated death of John Spencer by only a year).  Leo and the president argue, Leo is fired (this all progresses a bit implausibly in my opinion), Barlett's MS begins to manifest in more serious and disabling ways and we're introduced to the new ""generation' of presidential wannabes positioning to push out the old guard. Even Donna moves on and away from Josh.  The season is a painful reminder that life moves on but I think it makes the point in rather a heavy handed way.  Still some of the best TV ever..  I just don't see myself wanting to return to this season as much as I have others",1396137600,,1078,4.530927835051546

2518152,4,B000EGEJI4,the West Wing has kept my interest for 7 seasons.  But you have to say there is something to bins watching a complete season at 2 sittings!,1395705600,,139,4.148148148148148
2518153,4,B000EGEJI4,"I binge watched this season and soon realized I wasn't as caught up in the episodes as I was with earlier seasons. I even started surfing the web while the shows played (a bad sign).  The Smits/Alda storylines just didn't grab me, and there was one episode taking place on election night that seemed to do nothing but illustrate what chaos there is among the campaign workers at such times. It felt like pointless filler that got the message across early on, then kept on delivering it for 45 minutes. That's just one example of what I thought was just filling time rather than enriching the show. Still, four stars isn't exactly chopped liver, which means I did get many hours of above-average entertainment from the series.

One thing that struck me throughout the entire series is that the political issues raised in the episodes are still relevant today. There's no sense that the series is about another time and place. It's now, today.

When the series ended, I felt like I'd lost some close friends. I'm searching for something new to watch -- something that lives up to the quality of The West Wing. I'd welcome any suggestions.",1395705600,,1136,4.698492462311558

2518155,5,B000EGEJI4,Loved the series when it first ran. Just as good upon rewatching. Amazing how much of the original stories were still relevant.

A good use of one's time.",1394928000,,145,4.76
2518157,3,B000EGEJI4,The sixth season started as interesting as the first 5 seasons. I found myself less likely to pay close attention as the episodes focused more and more on the characters. I only found tidbits in the portions where the began the wrap up in the stories for the original characters. I did not want to know more about the possible presidents to be. By the end of the season I did not know if I wanted to watch the last season.,1394582400,,422,4.222222222222222

2518165,5,B000EGEJI4,I never watched when this season was first on TV because the storyline was pulling away from the White House and moving into the campaign trail. I wish I had now. The plot is still cutting edge and leaves you wanting more.  The wheeling and dealing that goes on behind the scenes in Washington and during the campaign brings all our worsed fears to light. Very poignant. I love being able to watch a whole season and not have to wait a week between offerings.,1393027200,,459,4.4

2518170,5,B000EGEJI4,"I watched the other seasons. Some people complain the show's focus has changed, and to some extent that is true. But if the focus has changed, it is to be expected. Everyone on the show is now a seasoned veteran of two election campaigns, they're well experienced in politics, you would expect them to be much more knowledgeable and experienced in handling crises, and because minor incidents would go to lower-level staff members, the ""top tier"" staff would only be handling the significant events which means the crises become more serious. I do not believe the quality of the writing dropped. And if I thought it had I'd complain; I insist on good writing in the shows I recommend. Now, if you're not interested in politics you probably won't care for this show, just like if you're not interested in crime shows you wouldn't care for ""The Blacklist"" (which is a show that's so good it's actually better than the trailers promise) but The West Wing has always been consistently good.",1392249600,,986,4.771929824561403

2518175,5,B000EGEJI4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the complete series.  I didn't watch when it was originally broadcast but it was recommended by my nephew when we were watching Newsroom another series from Aaron Sorkin.  While it doesn't display the high level of dysfunction that is Washington, especially our Congress today, it does offer some insight to the negotiations and intense strategy to make government work.  In addition, we glimpse the grueling hours, scrutiny and high energy required to function on that stage.

The character development makes you care about these people and like most of them. The story line moves smoothly throughout the series.

I would recommend this to anyone who wonders about Washington.  Streaming from Amazon was flawless also.",1391472000,,745,5.271186440677966

I think Alan Alda and Jimmy Smit are good actors in this season.",1385856000,,353,4.348484848484849
2518225,5,B000EGEJI4,"West Wing has to be one of the best shows ever.  The acting, the plots and of course Aaron Sorkins writing.  I watched them all originally and now enjoying them just as much a second time around.",1385251200,,195,4.243243243243243

2518228,5,B000EGEJI4,"If you had to ask me the stupid question---What is the best TV show ever-------I wouldn't have to think.  For me it is the West Wing.  Everything that makes something great, the writing, the directing, the acting, the production is world class.  But of those is the writing of Aaron Sorkin.  Not only are his words great, the inventiveness of the story telling is sheer genius.

You will not be able to stop watching, sw plan on sleepless nights!",1384646400,,446,4.594936708860759
2518229,4,B000EGEJI4,"It is still good, but I must say I am not the biggest fan of the campaign story lines. The happenings in the actual west wing seem to get pushed to the background, which leaves me wishing there was no campaigns...lol",1384387200,,216,4.2926829268292686

2518242,5,B000EGEJI4,"The DVDs themselves were perfect.  But in my opinion, West Wing's seventh season was arguably the best.  But you really ought to watch all seven seasons in the proper order.  So start with Season 1!",1383264000,,198,4.6
2518243,5,B000EGEJI4,I love the West Wing. The humor is fantastic. The only season I could do without is the last one (7?) but the rest of the series is really top notch. I highly encourage anyone on the fence to buy.,1383091200,,196,3.925

2518249,5,B000EGEJI4,We loved every single episode and only wish they were still making the show.  Why didn't they continue the show with Smits as the President?,1381708800,,140,4.6

2518251,5,B000EGEJI4,The team begins to crack apart as the administration and its staffers consider the 8th year.  Campaigning brings out aspects of character not seen before.  The President's challenges due to MS and those presented to his staff are in full bloom..  A new Chief of Staff must establish a role where there are no precedents. The writing remains very good.  the actors are well chosen for their roles.,1381708800,,396,4.779411764705882

2518264,5,B000EGEJI4,Loving all the seasons.  Working my way through the last season and hate to see it end.  Love the cast and all the extras that show up for a few episodes.  It was a great series when it first aired and I am really enjoying it again.,1380844800,,232,3.893617021276596

If you have come this far, continue viewing the episodes.",1380412800,,248,4.1875
2518267,5,B000EGEJI4,I loved the whole series. Have watched all the seasons several times and wished that they could have stayed on TV. I get tired of all the reality shows - that's not TV. I want a story. Thanks for making this show.,1380326400,,213,4.095238095238095

2518274,5,B000EGEJI4,The historical story along with great writing and acting provide for a very interesting drama. Add a little interaction between characters and you have a wonderful show that's much easier to watch when you want without interruption.,1378598400,,232,5.297297297297297
2518275,4,B000EGEJI4,"I have gone back an am re-watching the entire West Wing series. 1-5 are outstanding, season six is not as good but the writing and remaining cast cary it. I love how even though this is 10-

2518280,5,B000EGEJI4,We have come to the place where we have to face the fact only one season remains. We will miss all the stars and their rolls because they do such a good job drawing you in. The hubby and I really have love the series.,1376784000,,217,3.8444444444444446
2518281,4,B000EGEJI4,"I am enjoying the 6th season, however, I am sorry the action is taking place away from the White House and out on the road with the potential candidates. The process is interesting, but I love the main characters and miss their interactions and  methods of dealing with the various situations. Very interesting how much this series reflects the current situation with government. Kind of spooky!
I love Aaron Sorkin's writing and it is noticeably missing. Am enjoying the new additions to the cast, like Kristin Chenowith, Alan Alda and Jimmy Smits.",1376524800,,549,4.967391304347826

2518285,5,B000EGEJI4,"Fantastic series full of wonderful characters, thoughtful situations and both light-hearted and touching moments. The series started strong unlike others that take time to develop.  This is in no small way due to the great acting and scripts.  Highly recommend all the seasons.  The final season that introduced new characters was also fascinating and enjoyable.",1376179200,,362,5.545454545454546

2518287,5,B000EGEJI4,"Entertainment with a strong dose of contemporary governmental history. This show's episodes explore just about every political / governmental scenario and event. Though it is now over 10 years old, it seems that little has changed in the political arena of partisan politics, political shenanigans, and the good / bad / and ugly. But this show does a much better job at exploring the how and why of it all than you ever get in our news media.  Season 6 and 7 have a number of character changes, and it is up to the watcher to decide whether they are for the better or worse.  The core cast continues to do a great job.  Each season takes the show through yet another series of real world political scenarios and dramas.  Entertaining even if you don't like politics since you can both learn and boo the antics.",1376006400,,810,4.527397260273973

2518300,5,B000EGEJI4,Thought provoking story lines that sadly are still relevant a decade + after written.  Does a great job of presenting how complex the challenges are - not readily addressed by party dogma.  Excellent cast,1373155200,,204,4.970588235294118

2518308,5,B000EGEJI4,"While I have never worked for government, I could only imagine how  a white house staff operates.  It took about a week for me to complete the seasons.  Every morning before work and after work, I would check out several episodes. My eyes were glued to the TV.  The actors were superb and they made each episode about the white house come to life. The issues that faced us ten years ago are the same issues that face us today.  I kept asking myself, who wants to sacrifice themselves for all that many of these people go through.  West Wing should be revisited by those who saw it the first time and seen by those of us who did not see it to remind us that governing should be about the people and the country and not about those who work for the white house including the president. Persons working in these positions all need to ask themselves, Is is about power or love of country or both?",1372550400,,892,4.279761904761905

2518310,5,B000EGEJI4,"The bottom line here is that this is a series comprised of intelligent discussion of issues that remain pertinent until the present, where a decent, albeit somewhat left leaning attempt is made to present balanced views of alternative solutions from different parts of the political spectrum.  Hearing arguments over deficits, engagement in military and covert actions overseas, civil rights, and many other issues, beats the heck out of the current barrage around who slept with whom, when, and did what.  The only regrettable thing here is that this series reminds us of just how poor the quality of what we are offered today really is by contrast.",1371945600,,650,5.065420560747664
2518311,4,B000EGEJI4,This season the west wing really changed up actors and roles.  They maintained interesting story lines and created friction in some relationships.  Progressed to finding new canadates for president Bartlett successors.,1371772800,,218,6.0
2518312,5,B000EGEJI4,Well this season kept me hook. The whole Middle East peace efforts intrigued and the progressing MS issues never disappointed. And the conventions finally were epic. I don't know what to do now that I have finished the series.,1371686400,,226,4.82051282051282

2518315,5,B000EGEJI4,"Consistently good writing and an incredible ensemble cast make this among the top ten shows ever made for television. While the view from inside our political system may be quite optimistic, this series should be required viewing as part of any student's introduction to American history and its politics. While the Bartlett White House is unabashedly Democratic, the view of both parties is even handed and good spirited; the political landscape is populated by fops from both parties and the occasional principled individual, also representing both parties. An excellent series.",1371340800,,580,5.455555555555556
2518316,5,B000EGEJI4,Enjoy the political posturing and the occasional rise to principles and honesty. Topics and themes could have been written yesterday. We are in 6th season and don't mind going back to watch some over again.,1371254400,,206,4.914285714285715

2518318,4,B000EGEJI4,"OK, aside from all of the prescient national and geo-political scenarios portrayed (to Sorkin's credit, 8-10 years before today) that were happening in 2013 as we watched, or happened just recently (uncanny, really), I just got tired! I'm tired of all the BS in real politics, too. Nobody can count on anything except partisan positioning and BS... At least the two portrayed candidates tried to remain idealized in their ethics and their attempts to shy away from Negative Politics and attacking each other... both maintained integrity which I think would be an impossibility in the real world. But, it is fiction, isn't it? Tired. Very tired. Need for many margaritas....",1371168000,,673,5.127272727272727
2518319,5,B000EGEJI4,"""The West Wing"" appears to be timeless.  How else explain the contemporary relevance of every single episode?

2518320,5,B000EGEJI4,"After binged watching the first 10 episodes I can't be but in awe at the acting and writing of the series.  The issues they portray are still here with us.

2518323,5,B000EGEJI4,This series has been consistently well written and well acted. It is intelligent and witty and does not talk down to its viewers. Newer series should learn from this that a smart series can be well watched.,1370649600,,206,4.594594594594595
2518324,5,B000EGEJI4,This series is highly addictive. It is Impossible to watch just one episode. The viewer should expect some late nights,1370476800,,118,4.95
2518325,5,B000EGEJI4,"The West Wings ends as impressively as it began. The similarities to what happened later are astonishing. Remember, this series ended in about 2007.

2518328,3,B000EGEJI4,"I am an older person whose hearing is less than perfect.  For that reason, I encountered a major problem with this DVD.  There is no closed captioning (subtitles in English), unlike the DVD's for the first five seasons.  I would guess that I could not understand as much as 25 pct of the spoken words, because of this.  There are many places where characters speak quickly, or several people talk at the same time.  The producers should have had better judgment, and more respect for the viewer.  Anyway, be warned.",1370044800,,515,4.666666666666667

Not only do you enjoy this series, you learn from it. Aaron Sorkin is one of the greatest writers of our day. His ability to capture ""reality"" in his scenarios is uncanny and absolute. What a treasure!",1369785600,,343,4.639344262295082

2518332,5,B000EGEJI4,"although this series did not directly relate the events of that era, it followed very closely to the the political and world events. It did not following directly the presidential powers or his ability to act or not act, it is after all fiction. It was realistic enough nto give at least a surface look at how our government runs and the people who participate in that process. All the important 'people"" were well fleshed out and that made the series have more depth. I have watched this series many times and never lost interest",1368921600,,530,4.589473684210526

2518334,5,B000EGEJI4,this series is a remarkable glimpse into the inner workings of Washington politics. it has an air of authenticity due to the consultants they used in the show who actually lived in that strange environment such as Dee Dee Myers.  It was a joy to watch all the episodes in close succession without waiting a week to see the next installment. House of Cards is good too but not as smooth or polished. worth the price of Prime membership on its own.,1368835200,,446,4.439024390243903

2518343,5,B000EGEJI4,The west wing is probably the greatest drama series of all time. Season 6 is one of my favorites because it follows Josh Lyman a lot and he is probably the best actor on the show.,1367107200,,179,4.0
2518344,5,B000EGEJI4,There have a been a few years of West Wing that were tired...but this final year brings freshness with the arrival of a successor and veteran actors from other hit sitcoms. Well written and acted.,1367107200,,196,4.628571428571429

2518349,5,B000EGEJI4,"After Northern Exposure, this was the best show on network. I recommend every season.  The romanticized yet ""realistic,"" plot line addictive and it must be watched from season 1, episode 1 to the end.",1366329600,,200,4.882352941176471
2518350,4,B000EGEJI4,This is one of the best written shows ever.  I prefer the seasons that focused on the governing aspects of politics rather than the campaigning aspects.  The two new candidates are very good characters but my heart is with the old classics.,1366329600,,240,4.690476190476191
2518351,5,B000EGEJI4,"This show does a good job of creating an entire political world. During this season, the campaign is on, and you get to see what it is like to wake up early in the morning during the long, hard slog of a campaign, but also how it feels to be The Candidate, with lots of crowds and attention. It was an extremely interesting season. My favorite episode was King Corn, wherein you get to see the same morning from the perspective of different people. I got a big kick out of watching the difference between capable Donna's morning, versus Josh, who can't even get the coffee right. And the tension between the two was good, too. Very nicely done.",1365811200,,644,4.420168067226891
2518352,5,B000EGEJI4,It is amazing how this decade old series could be applied to today's world with the same exact issues. It's also sad that the real government and citizens  have not been able to make any progress in the issues presented in his series-with the exception of president Obama.,1365811200,,272,4.666666666666667

2518354,5,B000EGEJI4,"Funny, touching, thought-provoking.  I feel smarter after each episode. The actors are superb and I found myself wanting to be friends with them!  Ultimately, it is the writers who get the most credit. I tell everyone I know that they need to watch this series again.",1365811200,,267,4.782608695652174
2518355,4,B000EGEJI4,"I love the West Wing. I also find it spooky how often its fictional characters and plot lines all of a sudden have turned into reality, as, for example, when both America and the West Wing elected the first minority president. However, the 6th season was still struggling a bit for identity and not many episodes are as memorable as the early ones. Still, for any fan a complete set is essential, and the discs and packaging are both up to par.",1365724800,,444,4.426829268292683

2518360,5,B000EGEJI4,"I've heard a lot of people say the 6th and 7th seasons are not as good as the first 3 seasons.  True, show is not concentrated on the White House each episode, but on the campaign trail with Santos and Vinnick.  Once again, showing politics as what it is.  Politics.  Many if not all of the issues that arise in this series are issues that are still talked about today.",1365033600,,369,4.228571428571429

Repeat viewing can expose Aaron Sorkin's dialog as a little self-conscious from time-to-time but it's a small price to pay to become involved in what was a delicious world of political dealings.  Sorkin brought in people who had worked in the White House (Dee Dee Myers, Lawrence O'Donnell (who played President Bartlett's father in flashback sequences) Eli Attie, Marlon Fitzwater, Peggy Noonan and Gene Sparling just to name a few.
The authenticity of story lines and characters is what makes this an extraordinary show.

2518449,4,B000EGEJI4,"Aside from a glaring continuity error from the previous series, `The West Wing: Season 6' carries on where season 5 left off. I found this series to be quite disappointing and for the first ever time since starting to watch all of the series I found myself bored during one or two episodes. The acting is still top quality and some of the storylines manage to keep you on the edge of your seat, but overall this is a lack lustre affair. Fortunately it gains some of it's previous spark in the latter episodes but by then it feels like too little too late. This series finds the White House dealing with the fallout from the Gaza bombing and a subsequent Israeli-Palestinian summit, a full blown MS attack whist the President is on a diplomatic trip to China, flag burning, stem cell research, Cuban relations, a crisis on the International Space Station and it also follows the primary Presidential campaigns of various democrat nominees who wish to succeed Bartlett to the Oval office. The series alternates between events at the White House and out on the campaign trail and this split focus detracts from the overall strength of the series. If you are a fan of the series' then you will still enjoy watching this and as long as you aware that this is nowhere near the standard of previous outings then you shouldn't be too disappointed and can enjoy it for what it is.

2518456,2,B000EGEJI4,"This will be of most interest to those who are hard of hearing and depend on upconversion through HDMI cables for the best picture quality. The first 5 seasons of West Wing included English sub-titles as well as closed-captioning (cc). Beginning with Season Two, the West Wing was broadcast in wide-screen for Hi-definition TVs. Using the upconversion feature of our blu-ray player produces a remarkably good picture compared with an S-Video connection. However, closed-captions will not appear through the HDMI connection so English sub-titles as an option are very important. Even those in my family who are not hard of hearing enjoyed the subtitles because of the frequency of fast-paced, witty dialogue.

Season Six comes in a box that claims to have English sub-titles but the DVDs do not have it. With Season Seven, the box accurately indicates sub-titles in French and Spanish only. The DVDs are still watchable with S-Video but it was disappointing to reduce our viewing standards. I assume that dropping the English sub-titles was a money-saving decision for the producers but without sub-titles these DVDs are not truly enhanced for wide-screen. Seasons Six and Seven should be priced lower than seasons 1 through 5.

The first few seasons and the last two seasons are the best. There are a good deal of special features and this season was amazing.

2518493,4,B000EGEJI4,"Through seasons 4 and 5, I often had the impression that the West Wing was running low on ideas.  The magic of the West Wing had been that it could make dull and complex issues interesting, and it was always presented in a more intellegent and optimistic way than by any media outlet.  Unfortunately, by season 4, the series had adopted a more ""in-your-face"" attitude and descended into partisan squabbling to drive the drama.  With Season 6, the series reinvents itself with a major shake-up of characters and focus.

First, the stories.  Two events lead to the shakeup in the Bartlett administration: Leo has a heart attack, and the election primaries occur.  The former leads to C.J. being promoted from press secretary to chief of staff, while the latter leads to the losses of Josh, Donna, and Will to campaigns seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.  Of course, Bartlett isn't sitting idle - he and his remaining staff have a peace summit (Palistinian-Israeli) to deal with, a stem cell bill, alternative fuel legislation, and even an asteroid on a collision course with the Earth.  Parallel to the (often international) crises at the White House, we see the beginnings of three presidential nomination campaigns.

This is where Season 6 is at its best, because we've never covered the ground before.  We see the difference between a New Hampshire primary and an Iowa caucus (and friction between citizens of those states and people from states with larger populations that are not represented in early primaries).  We see life on the road - the flesh-pressing that presidential candidates must engage in.  And we get multi-sided views on some issues, including (one dear to my own heart) ethanol as a gasoline alternative.  The science is succinct and almost always right (the only slip I noticed was Vinnick giving a child the wrong formula to find the area of a parallelogram).

This brings us to the rearrangement of the old characters and the introduction of new ones.  Josh returns to his old Season 1 position (which he shared with Sam) as the central character in the ""campaign trail"" stories.  His candidate is one of the new characters, played by Jimmy Smits, as a Latino Texan aiming to be the first ""president of colour.""  Because he is a rookie, we learn through Smits how a campaign is run, and Smits does an admirable job of slowly bringing his character from wide-eyed naivete to seasoned campaigner.  At the other end of the political spectrum comes Alan Alda as the Republican nominee.  Just to say that Alan Alda plays the part of Arnold Vinnick tells all - it is a masterful performance for which he was rightfully nominated for an Emmy (he won for Season 7).  New blood in the White House is not so interesting.  While Kristin Chenoweth is very good as the new ""deputy"" press secretary, Mary McCormack is promoted to a title-sequence position in her role as a new national security advisor, and I can't understand how or why the part is needed or why McCormack was chosen for the role.  It is especially annoying that, with her arrival, there is less screen time to devote to favourite characters like Toby, Charlie (now an assistant to C.J.), or even Nancy McNally.

Many were disappointed with the regime change from Sorkin to Wells.  This re-envisioning of the West Wing as parallel stories alternating between the White House and the campaign trail should re-kindle the interest of those fans, providing solid entertainment that is also intellegent.",1168128000,,3489,4.894557823129252

2518497,4,B000EGEJI4,"I haven't investigated but I suspect that West Wing makers have been seduced by the dubious advantages of HD. Compared to earlier seasons the lighting seems by turns either harsh with massivley blown highlights or mushy and soft. I am a DoP and I have heard rumours that the West Wing sets and lighting rig were retained without being adjusted for the inferior output of HD compared to that of Super35mm. It's a shame if it has gone down this route as one of the great positives for TV is the high quality offered by US mutliseasonal dramas like; Carnivale, 24, Wired etc if this quality is to be dumped for a bean-counting production excersise then we are all the poorer.

On a purely non technical level WW6 won't disappoint it retains all the pulling power & punch of previous seasons and is emminently watchable.",1167868800,,816,4.627586206896551
2518498,3,B000EGEJI4,"I've joked over the years (with fellow West Wing fans) that it might have been nice if I'd just stopped watching the show with 2 or 3 minutes left to go in the finale to Season 4 (the cliffhanger for season 4 was to much of a draw to see, and then never watch again).  The first 4 seasons were written by Aaron Sorkin.  They were smart, funny / full of wit, fast paced, and had an almost ""feel good"" quality to them.  What's more, they showed the honor and dignity that can come with public service.  Sorkin was fired at the end of Season 4, and season 5 was simply horrific.  They dumbed the show down, took out the comedy, slowed the show down, and lost all track of what the show was about.  Then came season 6.  Season 6, to me, was the season where the B team (replacing Sorkin) finally got on their feet.  The show was never going to recapture what it was for the first 4 seasons, but it could try to move on.  Season 6 was a decent attempt to move on.

If you weren't into the Sorkin seasons, or did not watch them, Season 6 might seem like a nice season.  Not great, but nice.  For Sorkin fans, it would be a disappointment, but would be a huge improvement over Season 5.  At times the season suffered from pressing - i.e. solving social security in 1 episode, or solving the standoff with Cuba in 1 episode - but it was still decent entertainment.  If you got hooked by the first 4 years, you simply had to see the show through to its end.  Out of the 7 seasons, I rank this one a solid #6.  It's nowhere near the quality of seasons 1-4, not quite as good as the final season, but far, far better than Season 5.",1167868800,,1620,4.095238095238095

2518500,3,B000EGEJI4,"This is a pretty good season.  It deals a lot with foreign policy at first; especially the middle east.  You also get a lot of inside information as to the early stages of a presidential campaign: how it works, how promises get made, how polling factors in, etc.  Unfortunately we get shorted a little on the day-to-day issue-related banter of the White House.  About a third of the episodes focus on the early campaign trail, and most of it in the second half of the season.  So as the season progresses, you get less and less of the White House.

My biggest companit with this product is the lack of subtitles in English.  Seasons 1-5 had them, why not 6?  It's like the producers of the DVD sets couldn't stay consistent when choosing features. Closed captioning works, but isn't as desireable as subtitles in my opinion.  West Wing dialogue moves so quickly, I frequently need the subtitles to keep up.

Obviously, lack of Aaron Sorkin has affected the storyline and dialogue some, so there is that deficiency as well.

Not the best of the West Wing seasons, but still very good.  Lots of new issues and scenarios played out for us, and some fresh faces as well as the old ones.  In short, I'm glad I own it.",1163116800,4,1212,4.504587155963303

It still dealt w/ some issues relative to current events and issues at present.

Aside from that, the quality of this show decreased significantly after Aaron Sorkin left and the writer pretty much changed each episode, leaving the season disjointed and the feeling of each episode different from the one preceeding and succeeding it.

2518528,4,B000EGEJI4,"First - the bad: There are few ""extras"" on this set of West Wing DVD's.  The early, glory days seasons were filled with jubilant documentaries and the ""commentary"" tracks were insightful.  In this set the only ""extra"" of note is a terrific little documentary on the evolution of the character of Claudia Jean Craig - remembering CJ from her introductory scene where she pratfalls off the back of a treadmill to her eventual selection to succeed Leo as Chief of Staff.  Also inexcusable (given how good the prior box sets are) is lack of English subtitles.  If someone at your house is hard of hearing, better hope they can read French or Spanish.

Now - to the show.  I fall in the category that considers ""West Wing"" among the best tv shows ever. Period.  I also agree that the show took a disheartening turn for the worst with the departure of creator/writor Aaron Sorkin.  This season has some excellent moments, but the moments that are not excellent are nearly painful.

The season 4 finale leads President Bartlet to try to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, over the protests of everyone else, especially Leo.

Later the Prez' Multiple Sclerosis acts up just in time for an historic summit in China.

With a nod towards reality the show recognizes that a new President must be elected, and about half of this season is devoted to the primary process, paring down the Dems choices between VP ""Bingo Bob"" Russell, scandal-prone former VP John Hoynes, and the new ""character of substance"", Texas Representative Matthew Santos (played well by Jimmy Smits).  Unlike the great ""early years"" episodes where everyone Barlet meets falls under his spell as a candidate, Santos' greatness is only apparent to Josh, who gives his resignation to the current White House and goes off to lead the Quixotic Santos campaign. Donna has also just resigned from her position as Josh's assistant, realizing he'll never see her as much other than a secretary.  It's a little painful watching Donna and Will off stumping for empty-shirt Russell.  The Republicans are preparing to annoint Alan Alda as Senator Arnold Vinick.  Vinick must have been a liberal's dream of a Republican candidate - not aligned with the religious right and only opposed to ""partial birth"" abortions.

Part of the draw of the early seasons (aside from the razor sharp Sorkin dialogue) was the ""we're-all-in-this-together"" attitude of the entire cast - and a few times I found myself wishing for the return of Sam Seaborn.

Season Six only suffers in comparison to the brilliant first few seasons - sort of the way that ""Godfather III"" looks pale standing next to the first II Coppola epics.  But for West Wing fans it's worth it to watch again and see moments such as when Tobey, Josh and the President tell C.J. that they're uncomfortable working for a woman Chief of Staff...",1150848000,36,2859,4.847736625514403
2518529,2,B000EGEJI4,"Unlike the previous 5 season releases of West Wing and also not following the broadcasts of the Sixth Season, the current release in DVD format does NOT have English sub titles. This is most unfortunate in that some of the dialog is nearly impossible to follow 100% without sub titles. In an informal viewing, not one person was able to catch all of the dialog. One of the actors was even affectionately nick named ""Mumble Blond"" after viewing this release.",1150588800,6,457,4.725
2518530,4,B000EGEJI4,"The difference in the style if not the substance of ""The West Wing"" in the wake of Aaron Sorkin's depature crystalized for me in the final episode of the series when I realized that Sorkin would not have simply referred to the inaugural address of the new president who replaced President Jed Barlett (Martin Sheen), he would have written it and we would have seen and heard it.  This perspective becomes useful in looking at the last couple of seasons of ""The West Wing"" because while the show never ran out of ideas regarding the wonderful world of politics, the execution of those ideas was never quite as glorious as during the first Barlett Administration.

The Sixth Season of ""The West Wing"" was ambitious in two regards.  First, it started off by attempting to solve the quagmire of peace in the Middle East, at least as it applies to the tensions between Israel and the Palestinians (""The Birnam Wood"").  Then it moved on to getting an accord with China (""Impact Winter""), which would be following the lame duck game plan of trying to have an impact on international relations since everybody has stopped listening to you at home.  I found the Middle East negotiations to be tinted more with pragmatism than idealism, but while Barlett's MS problems upped the ante on his negotiations with the Chinese, the nuts and bolts of how he got the detail were hidden behind closed doors.  Certainly this added drama to the proceedings, but it also represented the tendency for significant things to happen off camera during this season.  In retrospect it seems that since Barlett now had to share time with the men competing to be his replacement that there was an effort to have him deal with real big issues.  As Barlett pointedly says, ""Progress is not good enough for me now.  I want to get something done"" (""In the Room"").

Second, the show established an entire second track having to do with the primary campaign to select the Democratic nominee for the upcoming election.  That the Republican nominee is going to be Senator Arnold Vinnick (Alan Alda) is established pretty much from the moment he announces (""In the Room""), while the fact that the credit for Jimmy Smits appears right before Sheen's at the end of the title sequence in the ""with"" section gives away the outcome of the Democratic side before the last delegate vote is counted (""2162 Votes"").  I found this much more interesting than the re-election campaign from the third and fourth seasons, mainly because I knew from the start that as soon as Barlett got on stage to debate his opponent, and I was right (""Game On"").  The flaw here, again determined through the value of hindsight, is that Matt Santos wins more by default than by the merits of his education plan.  The presumptive Democratic nominee, Governor Eric Baker (Ed O'Neill) drops out, John Hoynes (Tim Mathewson) had to resign the vice presidency), and the frontrunner is ""Bingo Bob"" Russell (Gary Cole), the veep forced on Bartlett by the Republicans in Congress.  That whole machination had to do with stopping Bartlett from making his Secretary of State (William Devane) his vice president and heir presumptive, and I suppose it would be tacky for two senior administration officials to be fighting over this particular bone.  I loved the description Leo gives of Vinnick as sounding ""smarter and more honest than any Republican they've ever seen, because he is,"" but we got to see little of that because the emphasis more on what alienated Vinnick from conservatives in the Republican Party (""In God We Trust"").

In addition to the newcomers Alda and Smits, the Sixth Season was defined by two other pairs of characters.  It seems strange to say that after a pair of Emmys wins for both Supporting Actress and Lead Actress that Allison Janney as C.J. Cregg emerges as a stronger character, but become Chief of Staff will do that.  The moment at the end of ""Third-Day Story"" where Bartlett asks her to jump off a cliff for him is one of my favorites from the season, but I also liked how when you go back and watch the episode again they set her up as the obvious choice for the job over Josh and Toby.  Less surprising was that once Donna Moss (Janel Moloney) got out from under Joss's wing and join the Russell campaign, she would prove to be capable of doing substantial things (like dress down a heckler in a chicken outfit in ""Freedonia"").  You also have Annabeth Schott (Kristin Chenoweth) and Kate Harper (Mary McCromack) giving women more prominent positions in the White House, making up for seeing less of Abby Barlett (Stockard Channing) and Debbie Fiderer (Lily Tomlin).  For that matter we have Helen Santos (Terri Polo) and Sheila Brooks (Patricia Richardson) making substantial appearances as well.  In contrast, Leo (John Spencer), and Charlie (Dule Hill) have less to do in the White House this year, leaving Tony Ziegler (Richard Schiff) a bit more to do.  There is also good news that Ron Silver is back as Bruno Gianelli, even though he is now working for the other side.  It also has to be said that watching Leo's heart attack in ""The Birnam Wood"" is now a chilling scene because of Spencer's death this past year.

The other characters that come into their own in new ways would be Joss Lyman (Bradley Whitford) and Will Bailey (Joshua Malina), who are running competing campaigns for the presidency.  Ultimately they are more important than their candidates.  Obviously that is true about Will with running the Russell campaign, but I think it is even more true about Josh coming into his own, if only he could call down without Amy (Mary Louise Parker) having to tape him into a chair (""Freedonia"").  I have to say, as much as the Lemon Lymans would hate to hear it, give Will and Josh candidates of comparable competence to run and I think the results would be different.  Ultimately my biggest complaint about this Sixth Season is that when it comes to the primary campaign stories I wish they would show more and tell less.  If you have an entire episode about candidates getting to debate, then seeing the debate would be a good thing (this is why ""The Debate"" episode from Season Seven was so much fun and exactly what I had hoped they would have done in Season Four--yes, the election happens a year ""early"" in ""The West Wing"" universe).  There were plenty of similar opportunities to show more of the campaign and to make Santos look like more of a winning candidate, and the pattern continues throughout the rest of the campaign and the series.",1150070400,,6519,4.746678476527901
2518531,3,B000EGEJI4,"The West Wing is a series that my family has received very good value and mileage from.  We have eagerly awaited new seasons, but this is the first one that disappointed.  Not so much with the plots as with the ever changing production value of the disc set.

The lack of English subtitles is completely unacceptable.  Aside from the turbo delivery or general muttering of many characters, the episodes become hard to follow in context while listening to the very drab and sparse commentary tracks.  I dread to think of the hearing impaired fans of the show!  There is no budgetary or creative excuse for omitting the usual mostly-accurate English transcript.

The disc holders have evolved over the seasons, and they have finally found the most inconvenient design possible.  For discs that are to be rotated several times *per week* for serious fans of the show, the overlapping design is wholly impractical, and the gatefold case awkward and flimsy and unbalanced.  Someone was trying to get bonus points for style.

The season itself is of course a dramatic shift, with the show essentially bifurcated into the old guard and the new candidates.  I find the Bartlett storylines much more compelling, and between them the clear leaders of the cast this season are Spencer and Whitford.  The marvellous Janney is essentially reset to square one at the next rung, like the eighth-grader entering junior high.  Despite literally letting her hair down, McCormack plays an empty shirt, and I have not cared so little about a principal character since the Josh-foil ""Mandy"" in season one.  No complaint against those actresses themselves, but the characters were both leagues behind the screen presence of Nancy McNally, and barbed charm of Amy Gardner.

The season also breaks the tradition of an actual life-and-death cliffhanger finale.  No doubt it would've felt contrived, but it further slowed the energy of the season down.

Looking forward to seven very much.",1149379200,8,1963,5.046583850931677

I have always enjoyed watching WW with English subtitles because the dialogue is so fast and rich that I find I miss important information if I don't have the subtext to read. I am VERY unhappy that they do not have English subtitles in this season!!!",1148515200,4,506,4.22680412371134
2518533,5,B000EGEJI4,"After stumbling a bit, but surviving the fifth season, John Wells, Alex Graves and Chris Misiano trimmed back the writing staff and brought us an intelligent, witty, funny, and genuinely affecting season six. After wrapping up the Gaza/Mideast storyline, the first half of the season explores the Bartlet Administration's response to Leo's absence, C.J.'s promotion, and (in a series of episodes that should have won Martin Sheen an Emmy) a devastating multiple sclerosis attack that nearly topples Bartlet's last China summit.

While all of this is unfolding, the would-be players for both the Democratic and Republican presidential races begin to lay out their cards. Most of it is examined from the perspective of a disillusioned Josh, who is approached by several candidates whom he ultimately decides are unworthy of succeeding Jed Bartlet. Josh's defection from the White House to run a dark horse campaign drives the season's second half, which alternates for a time between White House and campaign trail episodes, before tying things back together in ""Drought Conditions,"" the crown jewel episode of the post-Sorkin era.

The best things about season six are the (re-)injection of witty humor (much of it courtesy of the amazing Kristin Chenowith) and unbridled idealism, both hallmarks of the early (pre-9/11) Sorkin years. Even through the difficulty of the m.s. attack, this season's was a West Wing universe that you won't want to leave.",1148256000,3,1450,5.3
2518534,3,B000EGEJI4,"Some information:

Ok, I talked to someone at Warner Bros Legal (not some customer service rep, but someone at the studio itself), and found this out: There are NO English subtitles on this set, and it was NOT a mistake. Warner Bros has just recently decided that for ALL TV and children's fare, they will NO LONGER include English subtitles as they have in the past (theatrical movies on DVD will continue to have English subtitles, but not any TV product or children's shows on DVD anymore -- including the West Wing). I was told this is now corporate policy, and the advertising of there being subtitles in English (both in all sales literature and on the outside of the DVD box itself) was a mistake. If anyone wants a refund because of this (if the place where they bought it from won't give you the refund) you can call WB's customer service line and ask to send it back for a refund. But this is WB's new policy: no English subtitles on any of their TV or children's fare. So that would also include Season 7 when it comes out.

There *ARE* closed captions on this set. For some reason it seems from the posts here that I'm not the only one unable to get them to appear -- but they ARE there. My TV has closed captioning, and when I turn it on (""CC1"") I see it on most of the TV channels, as well as from VHS tapes. But I DO NOT see it at all with this DVD set. However I took it over to a friend's house, and on her unit, the closed captioning appears. I don't know why it doesn't on mine. I tried 3 different DVD players (all different manufacturers) and could not get the closed captioning from this set. It's a mystery, but my friend's setup displays it for some strange reason. So while there are no English subtitles on this set, there ARE (I guess) closed captioning -- though you may or may not be able to see it depending on your setup. It's a mystery why I see closed captioning on VHS tapes and off TV, but not from this box set.

As well as the discs being ""stacked"" atop each other, note that WB sadly decided to put their sticky RFID tags (security prevention Radio Frequency ID tags) on the inner CARDBOARD instead of on the plastic as is most common. So if those stupid things bug you (as they do me) you cannot take them off without ripping the cardboard and artwork from where it's stuck on top of. Such a simple idea just to put them on the plastic parts of the box, and you'd have none of this, but nope, they stick them right on top of the artwork inside.

For me, I'd probably rate this season as 4 stars, except I'm giving it 3 stars because of the way WB handled this set, abandoning subtitles, stacking discs as someone else mentioned, putting the RFID tags on the cardboard so it tears the artwork if you try to remove it, etc.

Almost makes me want to get the UK DVD sets instead of the US ones (all of my players are multi-region), but it's probably not worth the cost. But it's reasons like these why people often get foreign pressings of CDs and DVDs -- because they're often treated much better by the foreign video arms of the studios than the US ones.

Anyway, hope that helps clear up the subtitle thing.",1148169600,6,3145,4.268456375838926
2518535,3,B000EGEJI4,"I liked Season Five better. And Four before that, and... Well, I see de-evolution. Season Five seems now a mish-mash of quickly introducing then-disappearing new people, high melodrama presented in a shrugging manner - BULLETIN! Asteroid plummeting toward earth! Now back to politics as usual, a drumming of conscience wringing, and alot of talk about what we're seeing. Not consistantly crisp, bright, wit-driven as TWW's Camelot days.

Of course, my viewing style maybe wore me down too: The whole season in one marathon night. I kept asking myself 'Didn't I just see/hear this traumatic-yet-not-so-meaningful scene?' And 'Whatever happened to that fiesty little Toby foil?' And 'I wonder what Aron S is doing tonight?'

Contrary to other reviews I thought the season started better and then went down into a bog of explanations and character spins to keep viewers awake. Mostly due to mundane, rather rambling dialogue and preposterous soap-operatics seemingly aimed at paying off continuing characters' progress. Like Charlie graduates, gets lucky (although in a sincere, romantic sense)(lucky too, to jump the line to become a full-blown staffer, although still fetching and toting folders), et soforth.

Overall, the three stars are a gift for the memory of Aron S, and strongly influenced by comparisons to writing elsewhere. Tonight guess I'll go back to Season One for a bracing 20+ hours of WW Camelot.",1147996800,,1412,5.322869955156951
2518536,2,B000EGEJI4,"I just saw that someone else posted this as well, but if anyone didn't see the other post be aware that there are NO SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH on this box set -- only in French and Spanish. However I think it probably was a mistake, because even the outside of the box itself says there are supposed to be English subtitles. However none of the discs have any English, only French and Spanish. I'm not hearing impared so it's not so important to me, but it did kind of make me angry as well, for sometimes some the of dialogue goes by so fast (and if it's a technical term I might not know it) that having the subtitles there to verify dialog being said is one of the reasons I purchase the DVDs. WON'T DO ANY GOOD IN THIS SET. It's one of those things that you don't realize how much you miss it until it's not there. I hope WB does a re-pressing and fixes the problem.. right on the case itself they state it's supposed to be English subtitles, but there's no menu options on any of the discs for it, and it's just not there. ALSO NOTE THAT THERE IS NO HEARING-IMPARED CAPTIONS EITHER (the ones where you turn on caption-text on your TV for the real hearing impared). Some DVDs have it as well, others don't. This one doesn't, so there's absolutely no English subtitling of ANY KIND on this season. FIX THE MISTAKE, WB.

  The discs themselves are thankfully dual-layer one-sided ones (instead of ones where you have to ""flip"" the disc over to get more episodes as in some of the earlier seasons). That's better than the ""flip"" type because on the flip type it's hard not to touch at least one side of the discs (getting them dirty). Case is bad design though -- first time in West Wing DVDs that they ""stack"" two DVDs right on top of each other -- too close for comfort for scratching as far as I'm concerned.

  Actual content: I assume most readers here probably know the show and the episodes... but for those who don't, the 6th season was definitely better than the absolutely horrible 5th season (wish I could just make that 5th season go away), but it starts out slow. As the campaign gets rolling the episodes become much more interesting, and whether they meant to or not, the story lines that take place back at the White House now seem stale and predictable, but there's some excellent writing on the stories that concentrate on the campaign trail.

  There are only 3 episodes with commentaries on them... not anywhere near as insightful as those earlier discs with Sorkin talking... still, they're good, and it's a shame there's only 3 episodes with commentary. Some more of the major episodes should have had commentaries.

  Basically, for program content I'd give it 3-4 stars (out of 5) -- with the White House-centered episodes getting a ""2"" and the Campaign-centered episodes getting a ""5"". But the way Warner Bros packaged the box this time, I really want to give a ""0"" or a ""1"" (No English subtitles, no closed-caption subtitles, stacking the disks on top of each other, less extras than usual).. so I guess all in all I'll give it a 2. More than anything I'm disappointed in the way the DVDs were done. I recorded all the episodes of West Wing off TV in very good quality... and you know, what's the reason to shell out a lot of money to buy the episodes on DVDs when the DVD set is handled poorly? It's just kind of disappointing.",1147564800,9,3350,4.446982055464926
2518537,5,B000EGEJI4,"This is a great show.  Alan Alda's character helps people realize that Republicans can be complex, thoughtful and compassionate.  I loved how Vinnick struggled with the extreme right wing of his party trying to include them in his agenda and continually getting rejected.  Alda is one of America's great actors.

John Spencer's death during filming of the 6th season saddened me.  What a great addition he was to that cast!  This DVD is well worth it :)",1147478400,,453,4.818181818181818
2518538,5,B000EGEJI4,"The West Wing has had its ups and downs but it remains one of the best television shows on television.

In season 6, it was time for a changing of the guard.  President Bartlett has served seven years and it is time for the Primaries.  The bulk of this season was the primaries through the conventions.

The Republican Party has rallied around California Senator Arnold Vinick (Alan Alda).  But the Democrats are between the current and former Vice-Presidents.  But Josh is looking for the real deal.  He finds it in Texan Gov Matthew Santos (Jimmy Smits).  But Santos is ready to retire and raise his two children with his wife.

But Josh is persistent and gets Santos to run.  But he is an underdog but this is a show about underdogs and Santos takes out the candidates one by one until the convention where no candidate has enough for a first ballot nomination.

This is a great look at the primary process.  Television has never took a serious look at the whole process and this will go down as a great look into the process.  While the ending is preddictible and totally unrealistic.  This is a great stand alone season.

Will give a detailed review once I have a chance to watch the DVD.",1147219200,10,1193,4.509345794392523
2518539,1,B000EGEJI4,"BE WARNED: The information on Amazon's page is INCORRECT.

This Season Six DVD set has *NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES*.

I can't imagine why, but WB Home Video decided not to put them on. That's just great for those who are hearing impared.

It's not as if it was a ""mistake"" either, for on the Main Menu options, there's only a choice listed for French subtitles or Spanish subtitles.

I'm a fan of the show, and Season 6 is certainly better than Season 5. I bought the DVD set here from Amazon, and couldn't believe WB didn't care enough to put subtitles for the hearing impared on the disc. I'm almost ready to just return it to Amazon (their page says it has Englsih subtitles, and previous seasons have).

At any rate, that is the reason I am giving it one star. The 6th season was actually quite good, but I can't believe there are no English subtitles. Heck, even in VHS' day there were hearing impared subtitles on everything. It's really cheap of WB not to have subtitles for this season.

No matter what the Amazon description says, NOTE THERE ARE NO ENGLISH (or hearing impared) SUBTILES ON THIS BOX SET. SPANISH AND FRENCH ONLY.",1147046400,35,1131,4.519607843137255
2518540,5,B000EGEJI4,"The West Wing failed miserably in the fifth season, which nearly became it's last. The first four were jems and possibly the most intelligent show on television. The sixth season was a marvelous side of the West Wing that had not been fully explored yet: a true campaign. We learn to love Alda and respect Jimmy Smitts more and more as each episode progresses. This season was what saved the show from a embarrassing cancellation, which came only a year later. I miss Aaron Sorkin and Tommy Schlamme, with them, it could have ran through he entire Santos stay in the White House.",1146182400,14,579,4.631067961165049
2518541,5,B000EGEJI4,"The West Wing's Sixth Season was certainly a step up from its disastrous fifth season, which managed to cut the show's viewership in half and nearly got the show cancelled immediately after it. The viewing public didn't particularly take to the tenser version of TWW, complete with cliched TV spots a la Third Watch: for the episode Gaza, the narrator literally intoned ""Someone from the West Wing won't be coming home."" John Wells went back to his roots, and the result was unmitigated disaster. Rarely during the Sorkin era were there genuine crises to deal with (except at the end of the season, usually). West Wing is a show that you tune into for solid drama and smart, funny dialogue, not defibrilation.

Indeed, this season really proves superior to its predecessor, even though it does devolve to cheap narrative tricks at times to get people to tune in--that's right, I'm talking about making C. J. Chief of Staff when such a move in real life would make no sense, but they did get in an episode about ""who's it going to be"", and if it had been Josh, well, people would have been disappointed. After the wrapping up from the previous season, the show picks up with its story about the presidential race, even though the show's timeline is off by about a year. Initially there are a number of different candidates--for the Democrats, there's ""Bingo"" Bob Russell (Gary Cole), the replacement Vice President who might have moderate appeal but certainly has no brain; there's John Hoynes (Tim Matheson), the disgraced guy who used to have Russell's job and fancies himself a candidate, despite an adulterous scandal that involved leaking classified information. There's the Pennsylvania Governor, Baker (Ed O'Neill), who isn't in it for very long; and finally the dark horse, Texas Rep. Matthew Santos (Jimmy Smits), the moderate yet forceful unknown who eventually takes the lead. From the right, it's all Arnold Vinick (Alan Alda), who steals the show as a moderate California Senator who plays the game and manages to capture the nomination. Both the major candidates have a supporting cast: Vinick has Pamela Richardson (from Home Improvement), his wife/campaign manager, as well as the brilliant Stephen Root (from NewsRadio) as an adviser. Santos has Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), plus Teri Polo as his wife.

It's undeniable that part of the reason people still watch is the wish-fulfillment factor, even though that was the point in the first place. President Bartlet was a Clinton-era wish for a White House with a strong moral compass. With the nation currently under a right-wing president who is rapidly losing the support of even his most ardent believers, Republicans can watch to see a president who does, in fact, read the newspapers and make decisions based off of facts, not his ""gut"", and Democrats can similarly find some satisfaction in a candidate who has liberal convictions and is not ashamed of what he believes, but is politically savvy enough to avoid the culture wars. However, John Wells' conservative views are more apparent here, since Vinick is the hero of the show. In fact, it is Vinick who tells a group of corn farmers during the Iowa Caucuses that he opposes ethanol, a very gutsy move that all the candidates agree with but nobody except him says. Much like Bartlet was the ideal Democratic President, Vinick is being represented as an ideal Republican Commander-in-Chief. And say what you like about TWW, it still is much better than the show ""Commander-in-Chief"".

It's been said to death, but the show still ails from the departure of Aaron Sorkin. Additionally, people who tuned in only because they liked Bartlet's politics will be disappointed (although Santos is an admirable character as well). However, this season at least set up the show's final season well so that The West Wing can die with dignity instead of its last words being ""Bring it on"" as shouted by Josh to the Capitol Dome, or something said by the muppets, or ""someone will not be coming back alive."" The West Wing again becomes at least a watchable show, although one wonders if the payoff is worth the cost.",1141948800,123,4128,4.919655667144907
