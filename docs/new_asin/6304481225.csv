7873218,4,6304481225,Vintage footage from home movies - not sure if narrative is correct but it was interesting,1524096000,,90,4.6875
7873219,3,6304481225,Another bio on Adolf Hitler's mistress Eva Braun. Some film footage I haven't seen before. Good quality film stock of Eva's colored footage of Hitler and his inner circle's private moments.,1442016000,,189,5.129032258064516
7873220,3,6304481225,"This DVD shows mainly holiday film of Eva Braun; does not convey much of her life with Hitler.
Some of the narrative is drowned out by ridiculous music.",1356825600,,152,4.464285714285714
7873221,3,6304481225,"Probably, ""In Love with Adolf Hitler"" narrated with doco ""Your job in Germany"" presents this DVD itself.

Interesting watching of historic events in colour and effect of seeing Nazi top criminals as they were is shocking.

Context itself is shallow.",1254096000,,249,5.2
7873222,2,6304481225,"This is a half-assed attempt that could have been done out of someone's garage. A few good tidbits here and there, but nothing 'new' or 'earth shattering'. All the material here is from the national archives. The color portions are home movies made at Der Fuhrer's mountain retreat where Eva spent most of her time before she was exiled with Adolf to the bunker. Only very novice historians will learn anything here.",1091923200,3,416,4.791666666666667
7873223,2,6304481225,"Problems, problems abound in this shoddy and unprofessional production. First and firemost, the audio is virtually nil. I turned the volume up to its highest notch, a setting which would be ear splitting normally, and I still could scarcely make out what the narrator said. Considering the overall quality of this abysmal production, that might have been a blessing. Occasionally, the audio improved and then the words almost burst open the speakers of the TV. The narration was inconsequential and inaccurate drivel: ""Here is Eva in her special tea house dress, frolicking for the Fuehrer in the Berchtesgaden twilight."" Ho hum.
The bulk of the movie consists of material culled from the National Archives and these are Eva's home movies, filmed primarily in color between 1936-1943. The quality of the movies are superb in their natural form, they are less stellar in this film. Many are faded and obviously second-rate copies. Nothing of consequence is learned from the inaudible narration and the canned background music sounds like something from a Kindergarten class rehearsing Wagner.
I suppose some people completely new to Hitler or WWII might find the home movies enchanting. Trust me, you can do better than this tenth rate production, it's embarrassingly awful, seemingly produced on a whim in someone's garage.",1057968000,5,1323,5.245283018867925
7873224,2,6304481225,"Yes the DVD is out of print but there seem to be a lot of them out there in auctions etc. Not too hard to track one down without paying the earth.
The other reviewers have summed it up as far as quality is concerned. This is a DVD built around Eva Braun's home movies. It is not put together well, the narration is often inaudible and there are no chapters. The sound is dreadful and the whole thing feels like the producers couldn't put it out as just mute home movie footage although it would probably have come across better if they had.
As for Hitler I noted that no child or animal looks him in the eye and even his pet dog seemed uncomfortable being petted by him. So much for a ""gentle side"". Sorry I just don't buy that.
The footage itself is of good quality. It is a collector's item I am happy to have but there isn't much else to say in its favour except that it seems to have gathered together most if not all the footage of her that is around (and she's the only thing worth looking at.)",976233600,2,1000,4.107142857142857
7873225,4,6304481225,"This video is very important historicaly. I was offended by the snide remarks made by the commentator throughout.  I was also offended by the soundtrack, the trains, the baying dogs, etc..  This was NOT objective by  any manner.  We are all adults, present the information straight forward  and let the viewer draw their own conclusions. Despite these offensive  distractions I still found the films to be informative and enjoyable.  I  would have like to seen more footage of the Fhrer and less of Frau Hitlers  friends though. Also, it was obvious from the scenes showing the Fhrer and  the children that he really loved the children and had a kind and gentle  side to him in contrast to the often mis-portrayed image of a monster.  Propaganda is propaganda no matter who puts it out EVEN when it's the US  Government!
For those interested in history and seeing a side to Adolf  Hitler that few have seen before, watch this video and try to ignore the  commentator.",937699200,18,967,4.740963855421687
