8428878,1,B004GNAHEG,"I didn't like the makeup instruction at all. The Makeup Artist herself has a very pale skin tone. To make things worse they chose a white backround where she explains all the steps she is doing. I found it very difficult to follow her instruction and to actually really see what colors, brushes and steps she is doing. I am very surprised to read two high star ratings about this video. If I could, I would return it right away. I found many online instructions that worked much better for me than her videos. Save your money and look online before ordering these videos. They are not worth the money!",1347235200,2,601,4.472727272727273
8428879,1,B004GNAHEG,"IM SO SAD! I HAD BIG EXPECTATION FOR THIS DVD, BUT IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A PRO- VIDEO .... DON'T LOOSE YOUR MONEY YOUTUBE HAVE BETTER VIDEOS.",1334707200,,141,4.071428571428571
8428880,3,B004GNAHEG,"This video is ok, particularly the lighting and angles which make it very easy to see what's going on.

I did expect that there would be some discussion about what to do for different face types/shapes.  For instance, I have slightly hooded eyes, so you don't see much of my eyelid at all and some of these looks just look strange when done exactly how she does them.

I also thought the part in the 1920's tutorial where she ""thought they PROBABLY didn't have frosted eyeshadow in those days"" was appalling.  If you're going to make a video about techniques from the past, shouldn't you at least have a CLUE about what they did have?  Granted, I don't expect her to use waxy-type mascara products they used back then and bead her eyelashes, but I can tell you that they didn't have gel eyeliner, which she uses a lot for that tutorial (and doesn't mention that they didn't have that back then, either)  Still, it gives a pretty good look, as long as you're not concerned about learning anything authentic. The blush techniques she uses don't look anything like the diagrams and pictures I have from several books from the era that show how to wear rouge.

I can't say much about the other tutorials.  I was so disappointed with the lack of accuracy and detail on how to get around different facial issues in the first one that I didn't watch the rest.  If I could send this dvd back I would.  Like I said, YouTube is offering better stuff for free.

However, if you're looking for something not particularly authentic, and you like one of the looks on here, this might be the dvd for you.  It's easy to follow along, the sound qualiy is good, Danica does do a good job of explaining what she's doing and you can see very clearly what she is doing.",1327622400,4,1748,4.445141065830721
8428881,5,B004GNAHEG,"The Vintage Makeup Tutorial by Blush was exactly what i was looking for to complete the look i needed for my 50's themed party. Not only did my makeup look perfect , but i would have not been able to achieve this if it wasn't for the real time lesson, which made it simple to go step by step showing me everything i needed, unlike other videos which skip the important parts. I love the fact that this tutorial has no complicated maneuvers, or tricks which only the professionals can accomplish. The final look for each era isn't cheesy or exaggerated , so I will definitely be using this video for days i feel like changing my look with an outstanding result.",1307577600,4,660,4.418032786885246
8428882,5,B004GNAHEG,"I've always loved all the old style vintage looks on girls so this dvd was perfect for me. It really taught me step by step the best way to get those classic looks. Its easy to kind of fumble through a look but to get a professional and accurate look you need to know how to do it and this dvd really gave me the exact instructions i needed. Plus the dvd is fun, super easy to follow and super thorough! Highly recommended.",1307404800,7,423,4.108433734939759
