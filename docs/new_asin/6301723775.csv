8270673,3,6301723775,"This rare take on Hans Christian Andersen's tale packs a punch with a lively cast and excellent costuming, 1950's take on Asian manners aside. Too bad this was recorded in EP (Extended Play) mode as it suffers from more than occasional fluttering and  loss of picture. Kudos to Miss Temple for giving life to a beautiful tale, rendered unforgettable by this interpretation.",1500681600,,373,5.016129032258065
