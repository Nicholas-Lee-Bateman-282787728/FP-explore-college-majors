8480966,5,B005O9MHAI,"I have to admit that I am partial to almost any video about lighthouses and their history.  This one combines interviews, history and wonderful videography to produce an enjoyable experience.",1411948800,,191,5.366666666666666
8480967,3,B005O9MHAI,"This is an interesting video historically, but began to get old about 30 minutes into it.  Lighthouses on the Irish coastline are mostly built on inaccessible rocks, so it became obvious pretty quickly that if you've seen one, you've pretty much seen them all.  I applaud the brave men and women who toughed it out under extreme conditions to man those stations back when they were first built.  If you are looking for that type of historical background, then you would probably enjoy this.",1387065600,,490,4.809523809523809
