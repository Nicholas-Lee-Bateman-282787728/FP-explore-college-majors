8235257,2,B000ZC0TPO,I would skip this dvd.  It was not enjoyable.  Perhaps ir should be called just a gog reel.  I did not watch the whole dvd.,1365206400,,123,3.84
8235258,1,B000ZC0TPO,"I saw a film short like this back in the mid-1980's at a midnight showing of ""Little Shop of Horrors"". Being old enough to have more than a passing knowledge of the film stars included in this DVD, and being particularly fond of this film genre, I was almost rolling in the aisle with laughter, the tears coming to my eyes from the pain of it all.  And it wasn't that the clips were that funny, the same stuff you see on television blooper shows, but to see and hear the great stars blunder in their roles and then curse!  I never thought Cary Grant ever talked like that, or Gary Cooper, or Paul Muni. But for the first time I saw how frail and human they really were, and it was hillarious!

Which brings me to this DVD. Close to the same as the movie short I saw, but all swearing is bleeped out!  Why would they do that!? This obviously isn't a DVD for children - what child would know or want to watch anything involving some B&W film clip from the 1930's or 40's. And how many of us are so pure we can't stand to hear a mild swear word at a time of frustration, one spoken when the script did not call for it!

If you think you'd enjoy this DVD with the continuous agravating bleeps, then get it. Personally, I can in no seriousness recommend this DVD.",1202947200,2,1258,4.160493827160494
