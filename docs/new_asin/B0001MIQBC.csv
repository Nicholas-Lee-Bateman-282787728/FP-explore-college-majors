2015191,5,B0001MIQBC,"I've been waiting for these since Deadwood became a hit.  Man, its about time.  This is one of my top 10 favorite shows of all time!!!",1181606400,6,134,4.115384615384615
2015192,5,B0001MIQBC,"This is an amazing DVD loaded with all the first season of

Lovejoy.

1) The Firefly Cage

2) The Axeman Cometh

3) The Sting

4) Friends, Romans and Enemies

5) The Judas Pair

6) To Sleep No More

7) The Real Thing

8) The March of Time

9)Death and Venice - Parts 1 & 2.

Included is an interview with McShane (part 1) where he talks about Lovejoy. Gash's grungy divey was tamed by McShane and made him a wee bit more acceptable to telly viewers, but he retained the essence and often used many of Gash's story lines.

The whole cast is great, the series is created with loving care and BBC gives a great package at a super price. Not to be missed by McShane fans or fans of the series.

2015193,5,B0001MIQBC,"Finally, Region 1 gets Lovejoy!  This is one of the most beloved BBC series aired in the US.  Many fans have been waiting for this release since A&E stopped running the show as ""Lovejoy Mysteries"" so long ago.

Can't wait!",1175472000,26,222,4.5
2015194,5,B0001MIQBC,"If you are a fan of BBC America's Bargin Hunt, you often hear people talk about being a Lovejoy.  This is a reference to this witty show about a dashing antiques dealer who often finds more than he is looking for.

This show first premiered in 1986 in the UK but it took another five years before the second season aired in 1991.

In 1989, Ian McShane made an appearance on the US hit Dallas as a shady movie producer that seduces and runs off with Sue Ellen (Linda Grey).  Linda repaid Ian by appearing as Lovejoy's love interest in the Series 2 finale. But this is her only appearance in the series.  For the US, they used this as the series premiere on A&E.

In the series, Lady Jane was his unattainable love interest.  She was beautifully played by Phylis Logan.  She is married and definitely above his station but there are constant spartks being emitted by the two.  Lovejoy is has two sidekicks a young apprentice, Eric and the old sage Tinker.

This DVD should contains the following episodes:

The Firefly Cage - Lovejoy hires Eric and meets the lovely Lady Jane

The Axman Cometh - Lovejoy's latest acquisition is too good to be true.  And somebody wants it back and is willing to kill for it!

The Sting - Lovejoy gets even with his arch nemisis, Charlie Gimbert

Friends Romans and Enemies - Lovejoy goes on the road to find some Roman coins.

The Judas Pair - Lovejoy tries to locate a pair of rare dueling pistols (the title is based on this).  Of course, finding the pistols will uncover a murderer.

To Sleep No More - Lovejoy is given a puzzle to a fortune and he tries to find it for a widow.

The Real Thing - Lovejoy goes to a new market place and finds that everything is not on the up and up.

The March of Time - Lovejoy finds some old love letters in a clock.

Death in Venice (2 parts)- Lovejoy goes to Venice to investigate the death of a friend and a piece of artwork.

You'll have to wait for Series 2 to get The Black Virgin of Vladmir - Linda Grey's guest role.

This series was brilliantly wriiten and directed and will keep you entertained for a long time.

Let's hope the remaining five series are not long behind!",1175385600,96,2149,4.328320802005012
2015195,4,B0001MIQBC,"I purchased Season 1 from an Amazon reseller for around 90 dollars US, based upon claims that a Region 0 DVD will ""play on any DVD player."" WRONG! It is in the PAL format and if your DVD player is not a a multi-region one this DVD will not work. Fortunately I was able to purchase a compatible DVD player here in the states for a resonable price.  Since this was a Christmas present that I purchased 90 plus days ago, I could not leave feedback. I highly recommend that this particular seller change his or her claims...pronto.",1167609600,7,527,4.377551020408164

I enjoy that it is not the standard murder mystery - it is more like Leverage - cunning and conniving and doing good - most of the time, and sometimes it goes in Lovejoy's favor and sometimes not!

2015304,5,B0001MIQBC,"Great characters and acting. But what hooks you about Lovejoy is its unusual storyline. Set in the frantic, sometimes shady world of antique trading, it is a journey into the way that the British establishment and it's love of history and position sometimes clashes with and sometimes embraces those who want to buy a bit of that old status. Lovejoy is worth watching just for its in depth display of antiques and their seemingly arbitrary value.

2015376,5,B0001MIQBC,"This first series is quintessential British escapist entertainment. Adapted from the Jonathan Gash (John Grant) novels by the prolific writer Ian La Frenais. (whose other writing credits include gems like 'The Likely Lads', 'The Commitments', 'Auf Wiedersehen, Pet', 'Tracey Takes On...', and 'Archangel' to name but a few) These stories are consistently intelligent and delightful.

This first series (1986) is considered by many to be the best, but each series has it's high points.

Lovejoy operates in a familiar 'grey area' somewhere at the fringes of the law. This theme will be familiar to anyone who knows of Simon Templar - The Saint, and many other fictional characters, who spend as much time avoiding the clutches of the local constabulary as they do solving mysteries or hatching schemes.

The casting is brilliant in general, but Ian McShane was born to play the loveable rogue Lovejoy!

Lady Jane Felsham, played to absolute perfection by Phyllis Logan (Downton Abbey) provides the setting, the 'readies', and some of the best banter and sexual tension since Nick and Nora Charles. Tinker Dill, played by the enchanting Dudley Sutton, is a bit subdued in comparison to his character in the original novels. Nonetheless his boozing and comic relief is well balanced by his encyclopaedic knowledge of antiques and 'The Tricks of The Trade'. Chris Jury as the well meaning, if often bumbling, Eric Catchpole is funny and endearing from the start. Rounding out the core cast is the obligatory, if somewhat ineffectual, villain Charlie Gimbert expertly played by Malcolm Tierney. As the series progresses we are treated to a wonderful cavalcade of well known British, and a few notable American, guest stars.

A side benefit for those so inclined is a bit of learning about antiques in general, and the machinations of antiques dealers in particular.

It looks great, with excellent sound and is completely captivating.  I was never able to see the show consistently, so I am taking particular pleasure in watching the episodes in the order that they aired in the U.K.  If you don't know this show, the Series 1 is a wonderful place to start.  If, like me, your acquaintance with it has been spotty, now is the chance to see it from the beginning and relearn all those wonderful things about antiques that you picked up from the shows.  Lovejoy's ability to discern real from fake is a mixed blessing in his life, he is sometimes tempted to use this to his advantage.  More often he acts as a modern Robin Hood  ""stealing"" from those who would try to take advantage of innocents, and restoring or repaying the good people who were duped or robbed.  Aided by his ""team"" Tink and Eric and with the support of Lady Jane, a witty and adventurous high society woman, Lovejoy outsmarts and outdeals both criminals and shady characters in the antique business. This classic series should be in the collections of British drama fans, mystery fans and anyone who is fascinated by antiques.

2015431,5,B0001MIQBC,"Lovejoy began a 6 season run in 1986. The remaining 5 occurred in the early 1990s. Vintage FUN for nostalgia lovers. Even if the British filming at the time was a bit washed, especially outdoor scenes. The story makes up for that imperfection, making it 4.8 stars worthy. Lovejoy (Ian McShane) is a likable rogue dealer of antiquities. He's a divvy; gifted spotter of antique value. Sometimes bordering on unlawful, con, and charmed sleuth, he makes the series a delight. A must-view for all lovers of flea markets, garage sales, auctions, and sunken treasure. LOOSELY based on Jonathan Gash novels.
Regular cast includes ""Tink"" (Dudley Sutton -`Beiderbecke' trilogy) a divvy who drinks too much; Eric Catchpole (Chris Jury) youth on apprenticeship of sorts; Lady Jane Felsham (Phyllis Logan -a young Mrs `Downton Abbey' Hughes) a married rich decorator and antique crony; and Charlie (Malcolm Tierney -`Dalziel & Pascoe')Gimbert antiques and auctions owner, & Lovejoy's landlord and nemesis. Plus Brit guest stars of the 90s.

For those of you who have heard the premise of this show but haven't actually watched it yet, rest assured that this is not an ""Antiques Roadshow"" offshoot! This show is spunky, funny, awkward, eccentric, not the least bit pretentious or snobby, and has touches of mystery or murder sprinkled around. Lovejoy himself is both a treasure hunter and a detective of sorts. His sidekicks - the foolish young Eric and the terminally drunk but knowledgeable Tinker - add both humor and depth to the show. You'll learn a bit about history but won't be bored to death by it. Some episodes are every bit as compelling as a taut spy movie or a Shakespearean death scene.

2015456,5,B0001MIQBC,"At the end of Disc 3 there is an interview with Ian McShane (Lovejoy) describing the history of how the series came into being: the first series in 1985 and the remaining six seasons from 1990. McShane carries the show as a kind of Robin Hood of the antiques world -  and antiques are his passion. At the start it is revealed his wife has left him with and taken the children and the alimony has left him in greatly reduced circumstanes. The seediness and slipperiness of the antiques market is juxtaposed with the gorgeous English countryside,  stately homes and villages and the antiques themselves, not to mention McShane's handsome charm and humour. He is ably supported by the delightful Phyllis Logan as Lady Jane Felsham (a toff who like a bit of ""rough""), Dudley Sutton as Tinker, Lovejoy's offsider, and sundry others. A catchy theme song, a dash of humour and suspense, and some entertaining plots involving fakes, forgeries and double-crosses usually lead to Lovejoy saving a damsell in distress (from being ripped off or used) and seeing to it that the antiques find their way - legally or otherwise  -  into the hands of the deserving owner.",1362873600,3,1154,4.78391959798995

2015459,5,B0001MIQBC,"Season 1 of this series is, indeed, delightful. However, Lovejoy was a novel thing -- an independently produced series produced in conjunction with the BBC, not BY the BBC. And as an independent production, there is a lot which they didn't quite get right in the first series.

Here are some of the odd and delightful things about the beginning of Lovejoy...

1. Ian McShane looks so young. By the time Series 2 rolled around five years later, he looks like the Ian McShane of Deadwood.

2. Was there ever a series that did so much location shooting? They barely built a set.

3. The quality of image here is dreadful. For a show that is about beautiful objects in charming locales, this is odd. Murky, dull, and totally lacking bright colors! The exterior shots in Venice (on the cloudy days) are particularly color-free. And a couple of shots of McShane in Venice on the boat are of extraordinarily low quality. What were they shooting this show with?

4. Boobs. A couple of shots of Boobs and a little bit of profanity.

5. It took Chris Jury more than half the season to begin to settle into his role.

6. For something in the mystery/thriller genre, some of the plots have sizable holes.

7. The credit sequence is the oddest credit sequence of all time. It acts as if the sequence is telling a narrative but is totally bonkers. (Why did the metal filings turn into dust? Is Lovejoy painting the painting? Is he bidding on the painting? His painting? The painting that symbolizes his life? Why did he break it? Who broke it? Etc.)

8. Action sequences and combat this season? Not a high point.

9. In every Series 1 episode, there is one supporing or guest-starring performance which is so amateurish that it is impossible to believe that a director or producer could ever look at it and say ""yea, well, that's good enough.""

Series #2 is a very different beast!",1331942400,,1867,4.576576576576577

It also somehow turns tales based on antiques into plots full of intrigue, which is an impressive accomplishment in itself. Well executed witty dialogue and endearing if a bit one dimensional supporting characters top off a fantastic show. And season one, by far, is the best of the lot.",1258761600,,549,5.25
2015463,4,B0001MIQBC,"Until recently I've never heard of this series before, but now that I've seen it I have to wonder why it's not more talked about. I got the first season upon the recommendation of my netflix & it looks like it could almost rival my favorite BBC mystery series (Jonathan Creek). What I find most interesting is that the series wasn't picked back up for a few years after the first season showed in the late 1980s.

The series is about a character named Lovejoy, a man who is considered a ""divvy"" by the auctioning crowd. He has the almost supernatural talent to look at an antique & tell whether it is treasure or trash. Now you'd think that this would make him rich and sought after, wouldn't you? Instead he's living in a mediocre home where his landlord barely tolerates him. (Although he is somewhat sought after by his antique selling landlord as well as some others who want him to see if they've got something of value.) Unfortunately for Lovejoy, the antiques he finds tends to be mixed up with violence, murder & mystery...

It took me a second to get used to the difference between 80s tv & the ones released 90s & after, but this series is worth taking a good look at. While Lovejoy is not a very nice guy at times, you can't help but like his character & root for him. My only complaint has nothing to do with the actual series, but with the DVDs. At one point during the first episode the sound got a little wonky & it was very hard to hear the dialogue. Thankfully there's captions on the disc, so I was able to turn them on & still enjoy the episodes. None of the previous episodes after this had that problem, so I don't know if it was just a bum disc or a glitch or what.",1248998400,,1687,4.26875

2015466,5,B0001MIQBC,"Ah, Lovejoy...(by the way, that's what he prefers to be called, just Lovejoy, no first name, no nickname). How does one describe the man?

He's a bit hard to categorize, actually. Perhaps if we mentioned the things he's NOT. Not your typical bloke in any sense of the term. Not a ""working stiff"" like most of us. Lives by his wits. No health insurance, no mortgage, no car payments, no steady income. Not married, but he does have a older teenage daughter who shows up in later seasons. No steady girl, but he has a certain special attachment to the married and titled, wealthy and attractive Lady Jane Felsham.

Bit of a rogue is Lovejoy. But he's a certified antiques and art expert. Not above doing a bit of forgery, skullduggery, and chicanery, and he relishes doing it, particularly if his victim happens to be pompous, or greedy, or unscrupulous, or....even murderous. Lovejoy can spot a fake, a forgery or a ""repro"" (reproduction) from a mile away, and he can read people like books. He's just a bit smarter when it comes to collectibles; he's a born ""divvy""; he has that very, very special ability to ""divine""--as in ""divining rod""--the true worth of an old painting, an antique desk, or a pair of ancient duelling pistols. He's rarely wrong.

Ian McShane, sporting the perfect '80's mullet, absolutely nails the character. I cannot imagine anyone other than McShane playing him. He's a good-looking guy and has just the right combination of swagger, charm, cool, and seedy sophistication. He's usually seen in jeans, leather jackets and t-shirts, and might wear boots or high top black sneakers. Dressing up for him might mean a sportcoat over the jeans. He makes wisecracks directly to the camera. He's not at all intimidated by the upper classes; in fact, his pretty disdainful of them. Loves to tweak their snooty, snotty noses and bring them down a peg or two.

There are certain things and people in this series which just make it so perfectly appealing. The acting is so good that you feel that you are there with Lovejoy and his sidekicks, the youthful Eric and the canny Tinker. The scenes in the auction houses, art galleries and antique shops all ring of authenticity. The beauty of the English countryside is always apparent, and the scenes in the small towns and marketplaces are wonderful to behold.

Someday I'd like to own all the seasons of Lovejoy. It's one of the best British series I've seen: totally unique and fun. The series is based on the books by Jonathan Gash, which are as unique and fun as the TV show.",1233532800,,2540,4.724604966139955

Sometimes he ""helps"" items to be ""authentic"".  Usually the good rule the day and win.  These episodes are well written, acted, and directed.  The humor is light-hearted and memorable.  An example is in the beginning scene where Lovejoy has set out some of his purchases in his drive.  One is a crystal vase.

2015505,5,B0001MIQBC,"Lovejoy, the disreputable antiques dealer, is a joy to watch, along with his trusty sidekicks, Tinker, Eric and Lady Jane Felsham. Season One sets up the friendships which continue for several seasons afterwards. This series has all the elements to keep one's attention: a charming protagonist, suspense, sexual tension with Lady Jane, bumbling buddies, valuable prizes (the antiques). You find yourself rooting for Lovejoy against the even more dishonest villain of the peace, Charles Gimbert, who is also his landlord and thus has power over him. Lovejoy reminds one of Robin Hood, in that he robs those who are undeserving of beautiful antiques and sells to the poor but deserving. Lovejoy has ""the knack"" of knowing an antique; he senses them. He is in the game for the pure love of old and beautiful things, as opposed to Charlie, who only wants to make a quid. In this Season One series, a comparitively young Ian McShane is quite dashing, and one can see why Lady Jane is attracted to this down-at-heels rogue, considering that her husband is rarely at home and takes her completely for granted. She puts up with a lot from her ""friend"" Lovejoy, including lending him money and risking physical harm for him. Eric, his ""apprentice,"" is really a gopher, who oftens rescues Lovejoy from his many fixes. Tinker is an old friend, aways whiskey-soaked, who offers advice and moral support. The Lovejoy series is a stroke of genius and always leaves one wanting more.",1186272000,4,1468,4.923387096774194
2015506,5,B0001MIQBC,"Ian McShane, of ""Deadwood"" fame was quite a bit younger when he made ""Lovejoy"", but his performance is just as masterful. The series wears well over time because the subject matter, antiques and crime, is timeless. As an antique buff I was captivated by the pieces and the behind the scenes interplay between the dealers. Cut throats and criminals abound in stark contrast to the civility and snobbery of the collectors. Highly recommended!",1186185600,2,440,5.041095890410959

2015508,5,B0001MIQBC,"As an old fan from the days before A&E introduced us to ""Dog"" the bounty hunter, I have long been looking for a DVD collection of ""Lovejoy.""  What a joy for this to be finally released in Region 1 format!  Hopefully, season two will follow soon!  Minutes into the pilot episode, I found myself thinking that this is even better than I remembered it.  BBC television is so far superior to anything the US markets to begin with, but ""Lovejoy"" exceeds even their high standards.  The genius of ""Lovejoy"" is in it's organic, lived-in feel.  In each episode, Ian McShane looks into the camera and invites you in. Rather than requiring one to suspend disbelief and enter into some contrived fictional world, each chapter of this series is more akin to being included in on an adventure with a loyal group of friends.  The who, what, when, where, and how of the antique-related ""mystery"" are almost inconsequential.  Spending an hour or two with Lovejoy, Lady Jane, Tink, and Eric is like stopping off for a pint or two at that warm, inviting pub where they frequently gather, or, rumbling down a scenic country lane on a road-trip in Lovejoy's beat up Volvo.  A warm glow and peaceful heart always follow an episode of ""Lovejoy.""",1185408000,5,1223,4.677570093457944

2015510,5,B0001MIQBC,"It's been years since I watched Lovejoy on A&E after the birth of my now 16-year-old. The episodes just don't even seem dated except for maybe the cell phones. The books are great, but have a different flavor, like Ian McShane has created a Lovejoy that is a little kinder, and gentler; and Jane Felsham never figures prominently in the books I've read. Still, that makes it all work in the tv show. It was superbly cast, written, and played. Now, why can't I get the other seasons for less than $80 each?",1184716800,2,505,4.440860215053763
2015511,4,B0001MIQBC,"Having been a fan of the series after seeing it on A&E, I was stunned to see how young all the characters are for the first series (season).  I hadn't realized that there was a 5-year hiatus between the filming of series 1 and series 2.  That aside, it was nice seeing how Lovejoy's ""gang"" came together and it is nice seeing the complete episodes rather than the edited ones of A&E.

Other reviews here talk about the show and so I won't waste a lot of time on that.  I will say that if you are a fan of British productions and you like a mix of adventure, drama, and humor, I think you'll enjoy this series.

My issues come from the DVD authoring.  The various production companies who have to get their credits in at the beginning (including the BBC) BLAST the audio for their eye catches.  So while my volume level was a nice one for the various episodes, that same level for the production company eye catches threatened to awaken the dead.

Second, you can't just skip to the menu and bypass the eye catches or the BBC preview advertisement.  You can hit the ""next chapter"" button on your remote a few times to get to the menu so fortunately we aren't completely blocked from skipping all that crap.

Third, when you select ""Play All,"" you can't skip to the next episode and bypass the end credits.  No, you are forced to watch them and the best you can do is fast-forward through them.  That is annoying to me.  You can't just skip the open credits either because the first chapter break is well into the story.  That is also annoying to me.

On the plus side, there are four episodes on the 1st and 2nd DVD's.  The 3rd DVD contains the 2-part season finale as well as a brief talk with Ian McShane some 19-years after the first series filmed.  I haven't seen him in ""Deadwood,"" so it was a bit shocking to see how he'd aged.  I would have enjoyed a much longer chat with Ian and maybe some of the other cast or producers, but alas that was not to be.

Bottom line: if you are a fan of ""Lovejoy,"" this is worth a buy.  Those who enjoy quirky British shows (comedy, drama, adventure) will likely enjoy the adventures of Lovejoy and his crew.  Here's hoping we get the remaining series soon.",1184716800,2,2196,4.320293398533007
2015512,4,B0001MIQBC,"Lovejoy is not Shakespeare.  It is definitely eye and mind bubblegum from England. It is the perfect escapism from too much horrific news.  The show gave us a fun view of England, English antiques dealing and  character-driven plots. I happened on it on the grainy transmission from KTEH down the penninsula from San Francisco and was hooked just as the station wound down presenting it. I think there are 4 or 5 more seasons coming.  I hope it is sooner than later.  Ian McShane is such a good actor and well accompanied by the rest of his crew. There is no complete escape from trying to improve life on this planet, but it nice to find whimsey and some poetry in contemplating how things survive history in the poetry of their usage.  Hurry with the rest of those seasons.  I want them in my viewing library.",1184457600,3,811,4.513698630136986

2015515,3,B0001MIQBC,"...finest entertainment money can buy; only I can see they didn't break the bank setting this 3 disc set up.  I only give this item 3 stars, because the presentation/lack of extras on it is not up to snuff.  The sound seems a bit dodgey.  I had to turn it way way up and even then, the original production sounds like it was recorded on one mike somewhere back of camera. This could easily have been fixed, and without too much cost to the publisher.

ASIDE from this; and excuse the caps--IT'S ABOUT BL**DY TIME!  Lovejoy went off A&E network sometime in the late '90's!  That's how we Yanks were only able to watch.  I won't bore you with a long, detailed synopsis of the series.  I will tell you that I wanted to give the item 5 stars, and despite the presentation, of this set, you'll finally have the first series of Lovejoy. (I believe there are 5 or 6, in total.)

Despite the uneven character of a program discovering its strengths and what it's really about, here in the first series; that uneven aspect is still secondary to the fact that this show, is, without doubt, one of the absolute best pieces of entertainment ever to have appeared on television.  It doesn't insult your intelligence.  It has one of the best ensemble casts ever; and will rarely let you down for an evening's fun.  There's a nice bit of art history thrown in as well, as Lovejoy or buddy Tinker expound knowledgably on the virtues--or lack thereof, in the fakes--of the choice antique items that come their way. It's comedy and drama put into a very tasty balance, by Ian MacShane & company.

The main selling point of the series, I suppose, is that drama and intrigue result when the true value of an antique is revealed--or concealed, for that matter--and thus Lovejoy roots out the villain(s) in the end, in the course of pursuing his own good graft...

Another point I should make is that, after watching A&E's ""versions"" of the show, I came to feel that there was something missing in them, because at the end of the program, stills of the episode one has just watched, are shown behind the credits.  There would always be one still picture of a scene that did not appear in the show.  So, certain episodes just seemed, unsatisfying for some reason.  Well, in watching the very first episode here, I was SHOCKED by how much was cut out of it to fit in all those nice commercials.  (Mostly segues, etc., but still, there must have been nearly five minutes of screen time cut out, and that's quite a bit, considering the nature of the editing on the show, which was brilliant.)  So now you'll be even more greatly rewarded by this program, because it's actually COMPLETE.

Everyone enjoys a valuable, rare, ""find"", that's worth more than the usual fare one is offered, and I'm sure you'll find Lovejoy worth every cent you pay for it.  I only just wish it had a more deluxe treatment, here, in this box set...",1183248000,30,2897,4.522072936660269
2015516,5,B0001MIQBC,"What took the BBC so long? And what a relief, to get a break from the sped-up, full-volume, overproduced, profanity-heavy style of current tv dramas. Though it is pitched quite differently than Gash's books, I suspect this show appeals to people who tend toward reading rather than extensive tv viewing, who enjoy stories that cultivate the imagination rather than pound in the propaganda with either shouted exposition or childish sentimentality. McShane's Lovejoy enjoys life, it's why he always has partners in crime--ok, ""crime""--and why nemesis Charlie Gimbert detests him. The regular cast is pure gold. To this city-bound viewer, there hasn't been a better tv vacation than the Lovejoy sojourn in rural East Anglia since All Creatures Great and Small's Yorkshire dales and Poldark's Cornwall.",1182988800,3,799,5.4
2015517,4,B0001MIQBC,"Lovejoy was a wonderful series.  Although the acting was sometime a touch weak by the supporting cast, the scripts and characters are a delight.  Lovejoy scripts had a very British tone - the main characters were constantly beset by life's cruelties, but always muddled through with a wink and a grin.

Unfortunately, the first season suffers from poor production values and less than stellar video quality.  As I recall, this should improve in later seasons.  Don't let this deter you, the stories shine through.",1182816000,3,513,5.059523809523809

I too applaud the issuing of this in Region 1, FINALLY, and also hope the remaining material will not be to far in future release.

For anyone viewing these shows and never reading the books, something has been lost. The books can be abit different than the shows, for one example, the character of Tinker Dill is much different than shown on the screen. Though I enjoy both TV show and book, I think my preference leans to the TV show.

8014634,5,B0001MIQBC,"This is the 1st of 6 Seasons of a highly entertaining, comic and interesting series.
Lovejoy is an antiques dealer, often honest and usually able to charm anyone. In the first episode we are introduced to his cohorts: Tinker Dill, a dapper and admitted tippler, works as a barker = trained to sniff out antiques for purchase. Eric Catchpole, polytechnic drop-out in search of a job  or in need of a job, at any rate. Charlie Gimbert, an antiques rival who also owns an auction house and is financially well off  in distinct contrast to Lovejoy. And last but not least, Lady Jane Felsham, local gentry whose hobby is interior decorating.

...1... "" The Firefly Cage"" Lovejoy is pulled out of an auction by the police. Apparently, he sold a silver goblet that turned out to be stolen. This is frowned upon
...2... ""The Axeman Cometh"" In spite of dodging through alleys and courtyards, the Inland Revenue (like our IRS) agent catches up with Lovejoy. The bill due, the agent claims, Is 10,000. Lovejoy needs a big score to make that up.
...3... ""The Sting"" Sitting at Woody's, his favorite cafe, Lovejoy is accosted by police (again!), this time from Chelmsford. Apparently, Lovejoy that he sold a painting to a Chelmsford man that is not by the artist it was supposed to be.
...4...""Friends, Romans and Enemies"" Lovejoy is way behind in his rent. In lieu of rent, he agrees to scan a couple of tea chests. Lovejoy explains to the audience, ""In the antique business, doing a scan means going through a job lot of stuff and sorting out the genuine article from the shoddy crapology of the modern world. I only do it when I'm broke. Which is fairly often.""
...5... ""The Judas Pair"" This episode has a great plot and, unusually, gets serious and dangerous. Trivia Learned from Lovejoy: ""Like the sheen of petrol on water. That's what a metallic object acquires if it stays in a case long enough. That's what we call 'case-hardened'.""
...6... ""To Sleep No More"" It's a beautiful day for the Charity Cricket Match and Street Faire. Elderly Sam Wendell asks Lovejoy to meet him there. Instead, poor Sam stumbles onto the cricket pitch holding his chest. Dead of a heart attack at the first wicket?
...7... ""The Real Thing""  Due to a problem with a spiral staircase, Lovejoy finds it convenient to leave town for a week. But he stumbles on art fraud no matter where he goes.
...8... ""The March of Time"" Lovejoy takes a load of furniture to Ricky Price for restoration. A non-working clock is found to be hiding a cache of historic love letters. Are they why Price is beaten up and left for dead?
...9...and 10... ""Death and Venice"", Parts 1 and 2. Hugh Malleson bought a painting, ""Knight in a Landscape"" by Savoldo. Lovejoy is sure it's a forgery, but can't convince Hugh. When Hugh is killed and the painting stolen, Lovejoy goes to Venice to find the killer.

The 10 episodes of ""Lovejoy Season 1"" originally aired January through March of 1986. They total about 500 minutes of entertainment. English subtitles are available on the episodes and on the one Bonus Feature on the the DVD set.
...Bonus Feature ""Ian McShane Talks About Lovejoy: Part 1"" (8 minutes) A 2004 interview with McShane, who plays Lovejoy, is divided into six parts. A part appears on each of six Season sets.

Favorite quote, Eric to Lovejoy: ""We shouldn't be piddling around the country like this. We should be back home trying to make a dishonest living.""

A lively, fun series.
