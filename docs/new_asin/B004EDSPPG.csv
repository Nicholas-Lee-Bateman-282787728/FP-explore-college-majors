4336590,5,B004EDSPPG,"This movie/documentary was an enlightening experience.  It was the journey of a 40 something man who had a serious stroke, which was somewhat similar to what my family member had, therefore evoking the emotional roller coaster my family went through.  It was also a behind the scenes look at hospitals in China, where the man went after treatment ended in the United States.  The Acupuncture methods were nothing I had heard of or seen before, and the care and participation of the entire hospital staff in China, from the head doctor down to the janitors and cleaning staff, speaks to a side of Chinese culture I was also unaware of.  The brother of the man who had the stroke video tapes everything, from the hours right after the stroke, to rehab, to moving back home, and then to the Chinese hospital (where he got permission to ONLY use the video for his own family records.)  Brought back all the memories I had of my families experience and helped me to deal with the frustration and anxiety we went through, and are still dealing with.  Great presentation, glad I hadn't seen 60 minutes or anyone else put this together, true tear jerker and emotionally uplifting for the perseverance of their whole family.",1311638400,2,1215,4.734597156398104
4336591,5,B004EDSPPG,"I'm an acupuncture student and already know, firsthand, how beneficial acupuncture and Chinese Medicine are. Watching this film was inspiring and reinforced my determination to become a practitioner. I shared it with friends and family who were not familiar with acupuncture or Chinese Medicine and it was very eye-opening for them. Don't get me wrong, Western medicine is a very important component of a person's treatment regimen, but Chinese medicine has been fine-tuned for the last 2000 years and should not be overlooked as a viable treatment option--especially when used in conjuction with Western medicine. This film is a great introduction to Chinese Medicine and I hope you feel as moved as I did.",1311292800,,707,5.2105263157894735

4336593,5,B004EDSPPG,"I rented this movie because it popped up in the new releases and I am always looking for inspirational films. The film follows a former body builder whom has a brain stem bleed. He spent time in US hospitals for recovery but could not get the help he needed here. His brother found a woman on the internet whom travelled to China for treatment of her brain stem bleed and fully recovered! We follow Devin and his family to China for treatment and after 1 acupuncture treatment he is able to move his right leg and wiggle his toes.  Something US medicine couldn't do in the months he spent in rehab. The film will make you question our medical treatments in the US. Why don't we practice integrative medicine when it obviously works? I am so grateful that I got to see this film.  What a great testimony to family, faith and Holistic medicine.
Thanks to the Dearth family for making this movie. To Kelly (Devins wife) you are my hero wife, I hope that I grow up to be as good a wife as you :).",1306886400,2,992,4.2994652406417115

it's the story of a 40 year old man who had a debilitating stroke.  with the spirit of a superhero, the love of an incredible family and the help of acupuncture, this man risks everything to regain a body that can walk again. you can't help but be inspired by the love of his community and his acupuncture doctors.

4336596,5,B004EDSPPG,"This documentary by filmmaker Doug Dearth is incredibly powerful and moving, in no small part because the subject of the film is his younger brother, Devin. At 40 years of age Devin was a professional bodybuilder, business owner, husband and father who seemed to have everything going for him. Then an unexpected and devastating bleed in his brain stem left him near death, and the limits of the U.S. healthcare system left him unable to get the treatment he needed to recover. With the help of his family and his community, Devin was able to obtain treatment in China that combined western medicine with traditional treatments such as herbs and acupuncture. The results were very encouraging, and while there is no tidy, happy ending to this story, it carries a message of hope throughout.

You would think that, given the subject matter, this film would lapse into pro-alternative-medicine proselytizing or anti-U.S.-healthcare ranting, but it doesn't. Filmmaker Dearth chooses instead to focus on Devin, his incredible inner strength and perseverance, and the outpouring of love and support he received and continues to receive from his family and community in the wake of his stroke. This is, in the end, a simple and unflinching look at a man struggling to overcome tremendous odds and the story of how that struggle affects the people who love him. Very highly recommended.",1297555200,7,1379,5.07488986784141
4336597,5,B004EDSPPG,"I have been an acupuncturists for 25 years and have long lamented that our fledgling profession has not been able to better inform the public about this valuable healing option. I am grateful to the film maker, Devin, and his family for making this film so others may come to realize there are more options available to them. The film is very well made and takes no cheap shots at the U.S. medical system or insurance industry. It just tells an honest story of a man and his family finding an unconventional way to deal with a personal tragedy. The fact that we get to witness such a real and emotional journey makes this film very special. Matthew Bauer, L.Ac.",1294704000,13,661,4.516666666666667
4336598,5,B004EDSPPG,"It's all about family. Sometime we forget that as we go about in our busy lives. But, at times, it all comes back to us that we have personal responsibilities to our family. That family can be our own relatives, a group of friends we love, our local community or even the entire world.

That reality hit hard, when filmmaker Doug Dearth learned that his healthy brother in his 40's had just suffered a stem bleed in his head and may not live through the startling event. Camera in hand to perhaps film the last moments of his brother's life, Doug flew from his home in California to his brother's home in Kentucky. He had no idea what adventure he was setting off for and how these events would change his view of the world.

Amazingly his brother Devin Dearth survived and after a few weeks in intensive care he was transferred to a state-of-the-art rehabilitation hospital to start his therapy. The stem bleed left Devin in bad shape. He was paralyzed on the right side of his body, had vision and speech problems and was helpless to do anything for himself. Devin worked hard in recovery, a former award-winning body builder; he was use to working hard. And over the course of his treatment he improved. But there was a catch. Devin was about to run out of his allotted approved treatment days from his insurance company.

According to Devin's own personal doctor, he described the U.S. insurance system to a MacDonald's drive-up window. Insurance plans are a cookie cutter system designed for the many and not the individual. Devin had an episode that was more common in older people. He needed more time in therapy in order to go back home and support his wife and three children, but his family just could not afford the $150,000.00 per month to remain in the rehabilitation hospital. As soon as Devin's days were up, he was discharged and expected to go home. When Devin returned home, his family found it difficult to provide him the round-the-clock care needed and his condition seemed to regress.

Doug Dearth and the rest of the Dearth clan found it difficult to see their loved one waste away. And as Doug searched websites on the subject of strokes he came across a great rehabilitation clinic that provided eastern and western treatments in one setting and boasted a good record of improvement with patients like Devin. This clinic was also much less expensive, charging only $20,000.00 for a six week treatment. The only problem: this clinic was in China.

Doug presented this option to his conservative family and after much discussion it was decided to send Devin to China. His community held a fund raiser to raise the monies necessary for Devin's trip and care. And Doug was given permission to continue the filming of his brother in China.

The six weeks that followed appeared magical. Just on his first day of treatment, huge improvements were evident. The Chinese integration of eastern and western therapies was miraculous. Watching the filming of Devin's progress is heart-wrenching and inspiring. The Chinese at his clinic were like another family to Devin. Even the cleaning ladies gave Devin the much needed moral support to continue his hard work. If not film as it was, it is doubtful that anyone would believe such therapies exist and how successful they are. Devin left China in a much improved physical shape. He was sitting upright, didn't drool any longer and with the help of his brother he walked out the hospital in China.

This film chronicling the courageous battle Devin Dearth speaks to all viewers that have had one or more family members face a medical crisis only to find that the insurance battles and money issues come to overwhelm even the closest of families. This film is not the standard documentary that beats down the entire U.S. health system. It has a tone that is hopeful and focuses on the love of family and community with the goal to heal a fallen member.

9000 Needles has won numerous awards, including just recently The Best Documentary Award at the 16th Annual Temecula Valley International Film & Music Festival just this September.

4336666,2,B004EDSPPG,"I had my family watch this movie with me as I recently had a wonderful experience with acupuncture and traditional Chinese Medicine.  It was a truly amazing experience for me.  Well, I wished I had watched this movie alone first as our family's ensuing discussions (and arguments) were quick to come after the first 4 or so minutes into the film.  (I will soon explain.)

First, though, let me start with saying that most of my family is BIG on having Living Wills respected, even to the point of having some of them threaten they'd ""come back from beyond the grave and haunt"" the person(s) who didn't fulfill their wishes.  While I don't know if haunting someone in this respect is actually possible, I myself had been requested two years ago to respect my parents Living Will.  (This was especially reinforced after my Great Aunt's Living Will was disrespected and a ""war"" broke out in the family and split some of us off from each other.  So very sad.)  When my parents informed me of their requests, it was so very difficult for me to handle.  I told them to please tell the rest of the family as I did not want all heck to break lose when it came time for their decisions to be put into motion.  I hope this film will light a fire under them to get to doing so, especially after all that was ""discussed"" as a result of this film.  Now I turn to Devin and his family and their story...

Devin, the man in this movie who suffered a very debilitating stroke, had a Living Will which specified that he not be put on life support, did not want to be in a wheelchair, did not want to be dependent, etc.  In fact, one of the brothers in the movie states this exactly and even adds that Devin and his wife Stacey had discussions about this even up until a few weeks before his terrible stroke.  His wife Stacey further states that Devin and she had repeated conversations about his final wishes with her adding that he did not want to have a tracheotomy put in, etc.  Well, after that the film no longer served the purpose I had hoped for which was to motivate some of my family members to consider acupuncture as several of them had been suffering from intense pain and they now saw me feeling better.

At first, I tried defending the decision of Devin's family because they loved him and wanted to give him a chance.  Also, Stacey his wife had very serious and understandable concerns about losing Devin's first two children if he had died.  But after awhile I realized that I also had been considering a Living Will as of last year and asked my husband to please respect it which he said he wouldn't.  I had dropped this conversation last year as I wasn't even completely sure of my own thoughts about a Living Will at that time.  Well, watching this movie and recalling the suffering of a few relatives whose last wishes were not respected finally made me revisit this.  I want my Living Will to be respected and need to find out who will do so as my husband reaffirmed his first response to it after we finished watching this movie.  He just won't do it.

Part of our family's discussion pointed out that it sounded as if the family, especially one of the brother's, was assuming that his brother Devin wouldn't really want to have the Living Will put into motion.  When I watched the film by myself a few days later, I was able to come to my own conclusion about this without all the chaos of the initial family viewing.  I have to concur with them.  It did sound that way.  Other points regarding Devin's family being selfish were brought up, but I can't remember them all and one comment in particular I would feel really bad to repeat.  I will say that even though Devin achieved some amazing results from the acupuncture treatment, I wonder how he really feels about the road that seemed chosen for him.  This especially hit me when I was finally able to hear his question to the doctor towards the end of the movie.  He asked the doctor something to the effect of ""But when am I going to walk again?""  One of my family members said he was just being playful asking that of the doctors in China.  I simply added, ""Who really knows?!  We weren't there.""

I did some looking around on the web to see how Devin and his family were doing since his stroke and treatments.  As of 2/1/2013, Devin's website is said to be in the process of either being renewed or deleted.  As I looked around elsewhere, I couldn't find any other information on the web.  I really hope and pray he has gotten better.  At the end of the movie, even though he was better in some ways, he still couldn't walk unsupported, he still couldn't speak very well, etc.  I felt so very bad for him.

My heart does go out to him and his family.  It's not easy letting go of the ones we love.  But I also wouldn't want to see someone suffering if they were not able to live except without life support.  And while Devin did finally come somewhat ""around"" after 3 weeks of incredible suffering after the stroke, again, I certainly hope and pray he is either fully recovered (if possible) or nearing the finish line in being recovered.",1360108800,,5102,4.394456289978678

The movie is inspiring in that, the stroke victim finds hope and help in China, utilizing acupuncture and Chinese medicine. In our country these services are available in limited practices but not covered by Medicare, Medicaid or most insurance plans.

4336688,4,B004EDSPPG,"bluntreview (dot) com says: 9000 Needles is both an inspirational and a frustrating journey. Devin Dearth has had a stroke. He is breathing through a tube - but comes back from near death.

Then he begins physical therapy and the battle with his insurance company. Almost immediately the restrictions start and his assistance is up. He is sent home to deal with it.

His loving family does not know what to do. Devin is a 200 pound ex-body building champion; he is no wilting flower even as his body wilts like a dandelion in a heat wave. His wife is petite and just due to physics, she is not able to (literally) carry the burden, his caring brothers are each willing but around the clock care is becoming impossible.

Devin's brother Doug discovers a program in China that addresses stroke recuperations like Devin needs. With help from their family's church, funds are raised and a wheelchair bound, drooling, nearly blind Devin leaves for the 12 week program - his family supporting him via web and switching off physical visits.

Devin receives a mixture of Western and Eastern medicine that is unheard of in America. Within a week he can lift a recently paralyzed leg...by the time he leaves he walks out; albeit assisted.

9000 Needles references the acupuncture treatments Devin received in China. His road to rehabilitation is amazing. A ""normal"" healthy man is taken down in a moment by a stroke. Healthcare (?) deserts him. His family mobilizes and helps their own. Without their love and support, he would be in a state run nursing home, his family financially destroyed, and - no doubt - tax payers eventually footing the bill instead of insurance he bought to protect himself.

The documentary moving and motivating. ""Insurance companies run healthcare,"" is one of the greatest lines of the film. The allowed quotas, restrictions, and discarding will anger you.

After watching it, I decided to buy it and I show it or lend it to whoever would be interested. It has something to show about people, strength, tenacity, and struggle. It also shows what ""Alternative, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine"" is capable of in and for living beings. Spiritual? Miracle? Watch and decide.",1476835200,,459,4.897435897435898
