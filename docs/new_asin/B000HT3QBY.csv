8141312,5,B000HT3QBY,"Spellbinding performance from Ornella Muti here. Considering her young age and that this was effectively here first time in front of a camera, it's one of the most impressive debuts of the 1970s.

The Most Beautiful Wife holds up along among other Italian cinema of the time (the following year Lucio Fulci would shock audiences with Don't Torture A Ducking) and yet it also has its own poetic voice choosing to tell its morality tale from the point of view of Muti rather her impossibly handsome co-star Alessio Orano.

DVD looks great considering this was nearly a 'lost film' and there are a fine selection of revealing interviews with stars, crew and director.

8141313,5,B000HT3QBY,"fantastic movie. 14 year old Ornella Muti shines in her debut film, as the strong willed peasant girl named Francesca, who refuses to wed the mafioso head honcho who has eyes only for her, and will stop at nothing to have her. Vito Juvara is said man, played by the criminally underused and underrated actor, Alessio Orano, who is equally fantastic in this dark role. it doesn't hurt that both leads are extremely attractive humans. this film is based on a real story which happened in the 1960's, of a woman who refused to marry her kidnapper. it holds up extremely well over 40 years later. there have been other fantastic mafia films, but this one is unique for being politically charged with feminism and dignity, no matter what your status of wealth may be. Francesca goes through hell trying to get justice for the wrongdoings she endures. the bonuses on this dvd are most welcome as they contain interviews with director Damiano Damiani,  Alessio Orano and other people involved in making the film. it was a dangerous time to make a film like this where they filmed. to me, this is a high mark for Italian cinema, for the direct dissection of power, social status, violence against women, and for being a powerful film well ahead of it's time.",1430092800,,1250,4.681818181818182
8141314,4,B000HT3QBY,"Director Damiano Damiani always had political subtexts in his genres of films but comes to fruition in this powerful tale of justice and honor.  Based on a true police case which occurred in the sixties and supposedly changed Italian law, Damiani and screen writers Enrico Ribulsi and Sofia Scandurra fictionalize the facts and show how a small Sicilian town which was partially destroyed by an earthquake is taken over by the mob forcing people who are loyal and who look the other way to live in shacks as they play overlords with their lives.  Arrogant Vito meets up with a woman who is more than he bargained for in Francesca , the daughter of a poor family in the town, and who he wants to acquire as his next possession. With beautiful cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo and a haunting underrated music score by Ennio Morricone, Damiani forces the audience to act as the statue holding the scales of justice as strong willed Francesca battles Vito against the violence he enacts culminating in the rape of her essence and her growth as the first woman of the town to fight back against her violation.  The performances are excellent, handsome Alessio Orano who graced Director Mario Bava's haunting masterpiece 'LISA AND THE DEVIL'-1973 and beautiful Ornella Muti in her first screen role linger on the screen long after the final fadeout.  Damiani would go on to direct the excellent 'CONFESSIONS OF A POLICE CAPTAIN' the following year. It is more the pity that the company NO SHAME FILMS is no longer for they always cared about their product giving excellent transfers with English subtitles, informative interviews with the filmmakers who are still living and a booklet with cast and director filmographies. This release is no exception with a gorgeous 2.35 transfer and an awesome 45 minute extra of interviews with Damiani, actor Alessio Orano, assistant director Mino Giarda and editor Antonio Siciliano who have great stories including how they gave Francesca Rivelli her stage name of Ornella Muti to avoid the penalties of having an under aged girl (14 years to be precise) starring in a film including an infamous rape scene which they cleverly got past the censors; and an emotional interview with cinematographer Franco Di Giacomo which makes it a true highlight of the package. The Italian theatrical trailer rounds out the mix.  Recommended to lovers of Italian cinema and to the Italian gangster film genre, its worth the steep price.",1339459200,2,2458,4.956310679611651
8141315,3,B000HT3QBY,"a""La Moglie piu bella ...  The most beautiful wife"", filmed by Damiano
Damiani, in 1969 and 1970 is a remarkable movie even 37 years later,
incredibly.

The cinematographical quality is excellent, from the sharpness of the
images, the quality of the dialog, and the generous wide-screen
presentation of the filming. The picture, in color, doesn't seem to
have aged, except for the vehicles shown in the streets, mainly Fiat
compacts and Alfa Romeus.

Clearly, Ornella Muti is the star of this picture, by her natural
acting ability, charisma, confidence and ability to blend into the
story, playing a peasant 15 year old girl, who's a mobster's object
of desire in rural Sicily.

Alessio Orano,  with his youthful looks, yet sinister inner demons,
plays a man who decides to forcibly compel Ornella into marriage,
despite his belligerant, aggressive, arrogant, self-centered
personality.

The movie is not so much a love story, or even, a mobster story, but
a unique love tragedy, apparently based in a poor and small farm town
of perhaps 4,000 residents.

With so many movies candy-coating romance, the director chose a more
realistic approach, standing out for this reason.

The underworld presence ( organized criminal gangs) and its
associated corruption of public works contracts, influence peddling
on public officials, and manipulation of the  criminal justice
system, is acknowleged in this Sicilian location.

The power of this film on spectators, is the tension and
psychological complexities that are felt, as the entire savings of a
small  farmer is threatened of instant anihilation with and his
family's lives at stake as blow-back from the the mobter, should he
move forward with his complaint in the courts.

The godfather, warns the youth, Vito a soldier, against chasing
women, advising instead to focus on work and family alone. But, in
carrying out his advice, the whole plan spins out of control.

The script skillfully articulates the perils of social pressure on
one's reputation and economic ruin when one opposes evil forces of
the criminal underground. The risks of being ostracized  is very
real. Similarly, the mobster is very sensitive to ridicule,
disrespect, controversy over his own marital status and fiance's
behavior, by his friends, in the organization and among the public.

As such, threats, secret oaths, violence, pistols, rival crime gangs,
the obligation of beneficiaries of corruption to give back favors in
the future, the taboo of stooling, the lack of financial resources
for residents to move out of town to escape this state of affairs, is
told.

The stakes are high, in such a small town, to the point that the
mobster enrolls several colleagues in the organization to perjure
themselves in confirming a made up version of the facts, coupled with
the ease inhiring the best attorney money can buy, which the poor
can't do.

More could have been done in the humor department, although seeing
Ornella milking a goat was unexpected.

Overall, this is a captivating work, with a young  Ornella Muti
filmed at 15 years old, yet as mature and charismatic as we've seen
her in other films.",1201996800,7,3131,5.115913555992141
8141316,5,B000HT3QBY,The first plane of the Ornella's eyes is beautiful. The argument it is rude but well basted. In the end: the doubt: caprice or justice.  Good movie.,1178582400,6,148,4.481481481481482
