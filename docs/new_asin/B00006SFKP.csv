1794509,1,B00006SFKP,"This film is absoulutely horrendous. The acting is of the lowest caliber that I have personally ever seen. My favorite part is when the dude is pointing a gun at the kids, and when they show his front, he's holding a machine gun, but when they show from behind, he's holding an uzi. WTF?!?! I think giving this film one star is giving it too much credit, but I couldn't give it negative infinity, so one will have to do. So terrible, it's hilarious. Anyone who has an opinion that isn't the same about this film, well congratulations, you are one of the few people on this planet whose opinion is wrong.",1076889600,5,603,4.392857142857143
1794510,2,B00006SFKP,"This movie is hilarious.  But bad... hilarious.
I found myself bust out laughing at some really weird stuff and I'm not sure if it was intended or not.
This movie will be a perfect candidate for MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 2020.  If you love sitting around with friends and making up anecdotes to go along with the movie and laughing at your own jokes, this is a movie to pick up.
I bought it, and I bought it for one reason... CHYLER LEIGH.
She won me over in NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE, and I think she has a bright future ahead.  She's a fearless actress who has beauty, innocence and a wild side all rolled into one.  I really just wanted to own it for the nostalgia of it, and I'm pleased with owning it, but to be fair....
THE MOVIE gets 1 star, CHYLER gets 5 stars and it equals to an overall 2 stars... okay, so I'm weird.",1041465600,,822,4.150943396226415
1794511,3,B00006SFKP,"I have seen this movie and do have it on tape. To be painfully honest the only reason I do is because of Christopher Khayman Lee. He, Chyler ( his sister) and Daphne Duplaix ( who plays Chyler's best friend) are the only actors of any talent in the whole cast. Even Stephen Bauer is lacking in this piece of work.
I love Chris' work and Chyler is great, but they are much better than this movie and I am glad they have moved on. And knowing that they are Brother and sister, the fact that they played a couple was a bit weird. But they handled it like pros.",1034294400,,557,4.072727272727272
7973286,5,B00006SFKP,Love seeing chyler Leigh before she was famous love seeing Christopher khaymen Lee before he stopped acting. Weird seeing them and knowing their brother and sister! Still an awesome movie,1471996800,,187,5.266666666666667
7973287,1,B00006SFKP,"i got this movie for my older brother's bad movies club. basically they sit around during lunch and watch horrible movies. it totally lived up to my expectations. the script is cheesy, the acting is pathetic, and the fight scenes are ridiculous.  chyler leigh and  christopher khayman lee are siblings and the actually make out in the movie. GROSS! i like chyler leigh, and i think she's come a long way from this. good movie to get for the purpose of watching a bad movie.",1328745600,,473,4.552941176470588
7973288,2,B00006SFKP,"KICKBOXING ACADEMY (1997)
directed by Richard Gabai

This is a kid's movie that uses a lot of the conventions of kid's movies: bullies, physical comedy and weird catchphrases.  The plot pits two rival kickboxing academies against each other as good guys versus bad guys, and the losing academy will be forced to close down.  Truthfully it isn't as bad as people claim it is, in fact most of the things that make this movie cheesy are present in the majority of kids sports comedies.

This strange family slapstick probably would've faded into total obscurity if not for the appearance of 15-year-old Chyler Leigh, who is now known for playing Lexie Grey on 'Grey's Anatomy'.  One of her costars is her brother Christopher Khaman Lee (born Christopher Lee Potts), who is best remembered for having played the red Power Ranger.  While not as disturbing as the Pia Zadora movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butterfly/dp/6302038774/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butterfly</a>, it is true that the real-life siblings act as former love interests in Kickboxing Academy and actually make out several times.  Yikes!",1215993600,,1150,5.61271676300578

7973292,2,B00006SFKP,"I remember reading about this movie in a recent article on somethingawful.com in list of the ""top ten best worst movies of all time."" I then saw that it was on one of the movie channels, and decided to see for myself how bad it really was. Well, this movie is just terrible, maybe the worst I have ever seen. But it has some sort of sick, twisted entertainment value to it which is why I gave it 2 stars. I almost feel bad laughing because I'm pretty sure some of the actors in this movie are mildly retarded. If you're looking for something funny to rent, this movie is always in stock. The fight scenes are embarassingly bad, just like the acting and writing. Basically, it's fat ugly white kids running around a screen for 90 minutes flailing around and saying retarded, forced jokes. They also have a guy who looks like Derrick Greene from Sepultura in the fight scene toward the end.
Wanna know the scary part? This was only 10th on somethingawful's best worst list. That means there's 9 movies out there that are worse than this one. Scary huh?",1083715200,2,1050,4.44559585492228
7973293,1,B00006SFKP,"Wow, where should I begin with this review?  Should I first express my amazement at how any of the other reviewers could actually be serious in giving this movie a positive review or should I describe every aspect of its putridity to the T?
Maybe I'll just start with the plot.  To sum it up fairly simply, two martial arts academies spend most of the movie preparing their students for a kickboxing match against one another in the coming summer.  One academy is cheap and tries to sabotage the other in an attempt to defeat them in the upcoming tournament and obtain documents which will give them the right to shut down that academy and expand their own with corporate sponsoring.  I suppose the movie fluctuates in and out of laughably horrible moments of low-class acting with scenes of some of the ""bad"" students trying to pick on their rivals, and needless to say, the upcoming tournament is a complete joke.  (A win is given for 2 solid blows??)  This plot is completely unnecessary, it evokes no emotion other than disgust and anger for having watched the film, and it is pretty much a compilation of random events and endless (not to mention pointless) subplots that add up to nothing.  (In case you actually care to know, the good guys win the tournament and  ...save the day??  YAY!)
Though it may sound redundant based on what other reviews are saying, this movie seriously has the absolute worst acting that I have ever seen.  There are times where you can be almost certain that some of the actors are looking away and reading their lines from the script.  The fact that most of the dialouge is slow and has absolutely no emotion is evidence of this.  I cannot even begin to understand why this movie was widely distributed, and for that matter I can't see who in their right mind would even consider making a movie with such a horrid plot.  Nevertheless, the movie is good for lots of laughs, but if you were to watch this movie I'd recommend you watch it blindfolded.  That way, you can laugh at all of the idiotic vocal blunders  of these rent-a-actor's while saving yourself the anguish of actually having to see them and subject yourself to their embarrassingly ridiculous fight scenes.",1078444800,5,2206,4.649484536082475
