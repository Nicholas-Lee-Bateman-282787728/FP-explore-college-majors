8077331,4,B000AARKFS,"Pacifica is traveling with her brother, Shannon, and her sister, Raquel. Pacifica has a terrible destiny. She is referred to as the Scrapped Princess. The Scrapped Princess is said to be born under a cursed star and bring destruction to the entire world. Nearly the entire world is out to kill her. There is nowhere they can hide, so they stay on the move. Shannon is a talented swordsman, and Raquel is a strong sorceress. Pacifica has very good protectors. At first glance, Pacifica tends to seem like a spoiled brat. Sometimes she makes a complete turnaround and shows a sweet and caring attitude. It's kind of wierd how she changes like that. The 3 siblings will meet many people on their journey. Some will become friends and others will betray them. One thing is for sure; there will be lots of action and plot twists.

This series is pretty good. It has a good mix of action, comedy and drama. There are some really good characters that are developed well. This series stays focused on the main plot and doesn't diverge like a lot of the fantasy animes out there. It has good animation, voice acting, and a decent soundtrack. I really enjoyed it, but there are tons of better shows out there. I'll give it 4 stars, because even though I enjoyed it, it didn't blow me away.",1356480000,,1279,4.560869565217391
8077332,5,B000AARKFS,"The story continues to evolve as the Beast Princess sets out with her new weapon, looking for a fight, with Pacifica and her siblings forced to come along for the ride. This brings about a violent counterattack from Pacifica's homeland, leaving our heros scattered and Pacifica without her memory.
This story is just a heckuva lot of fun to watch, and you never quite know what's going to happen next. I enjoy the fact that so much character development occurs here, even amoung what you would think were simple supporting characters. There is just so much to like about this storyline and I recommend it very highly.",1165449600,,617,4.775700934579439
8077333,5,B000AARKFS,"After following the Casull family through three volumes (12 episodes), the fourth volume is a must see DVD.  Scrapped Princess is definitely the best anime I have ever seen!!

In volume IV, the main characters discover the detailed truth about the meaning of the ""Scrapped Princess.""  After learning the truth, Shannon, the main male character, continues to distrust the motives behind their journey.

The delimma between protecting an innocent girl or saving the world continues in this volume.

The English voice cast is wonderful. Sometimes they performed better than the Japanese voice cast. The animation and action is a lot better than the third volume. This anime series just keeps getting better and better!!

This volume IV special edition DVD comes with a figurine of Shannon Casull.  The artwork, design, and color is superb.  The figurine is an exact miniature replication of Shannon Casull.  This figurine is beyond excellent!!

Shannon Casull is my favorite character in Scrapped Princess because I identify with him the most throughout their struggles along their journey.  I am definitely proud to display this figurine for all to see!!  This is a must buy figurine to add to your collection =)

Bandai did a wonderful job recreating the world of Scrapped Princess for the US audience.",1158883200,,1301,5.1380952380952385
