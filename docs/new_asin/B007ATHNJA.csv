8513547,5,B007ATHNJA,"I adore Danielle de Niese and Philippe Jaroussky separately.  Put them together and musical magic happens.  The whole production is over the top wonderful. William Christie does his usual magic as I have seen before. The staging, the costumes, the acting the singing are first rate.",1469059200,,282,5.108695652173913
8513548,4,B007ATHNJA,"I could listen to Max Emmanuel Cencic and Philippe Jaroussky all day, so I was predisposed to like L'Incoronazione di Poppea.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed it as a total performance, and found a lot to like besides the glorious singing.  Please note that I am an opera novice and so can't critique this production in musical terms, so you will need to check out other reviews for that.

This ""dramma musicale"" concerns Nero (Jaroussky) and the noblewoman Poppea (Danielle de Niese), very much in love and determined to be together, but with serious obstacles standing in their way - Nero's wife, Ottavia (Anna Bonitatibus) and his moralising mentor, Seneca (Antonio Abete).  Ottone (Cencic) has returned to Rome to find that his former lover Poppea now spurns him.  Meanwhile, the gods watch and seek to demonstrate who is the most powerful ...

I found that this production isn't just beautiful to listen to, it works as a coherent story, driven by characters with strong emotions who seize the chances presented to them to change their lives for the (as they see it) better.  The acting is decent and the personalities believable.  I hadn't previously encountered de Niese, and she is a wonderful, youthfully arrogant Poppea, convinced that everything will work out just as she wants it to; her and Jarroussky's voices blend beautifully.  The other standout for me was Cencic as the hapless Ottone, taken advantage of and sent into danger by the various women in his life.  The byplays between the minor characters lighten the mood amongst the intensity of the romance and despair.  The endings are generally happy - or as happy as can be expected - even if the audience knows that the relationship between Nero and Poppea won't last, so this isn't a production where you're left feeling down as it concludes.

Other aspects, though, left something to be desired.  The sets function effectively, but are sparse and dark, and for me did not fit the mood of the production.  The costumes are dodgy - think glittering track suits, leather shorts, and unflatteringly tight or loose gowns - and fit neither the story nor the sets.  There's too much sexy writhing and groping amongst the cast for my taste.  It seemed to me that Jaroussky isn't quite as strong an actor as the role of Nero deserved, a matter quite separate to the quality of his vocal performance, but that ultimately depends on what he was asked to do.  The feathers and black lipstick certainly didn't help.

So overall, well worth a look for the opera novice, even if the production isn't entirely to your taste.",1448064000,,2608,4.82247191011236
8513549,5,B007ATHNJA,"I was happily surprised by the level of singing and the cogent production of this opera---which I have seen and heard in various other stagings. For those not  familiar with the sound of a countertenor, it might take a while to settle into the sound scape of this recording---but once there, the technique and interpretative powers of Philippe Jaroussky as Nerone will astound. Danielle de Niese is a sensuous and full-voiced Poppea and the rest of the cast provides strong support. William Christie and Les Arts Florissants are complicit in the success of this performance; Christie's graceful yet propulsive conducting shaping the proceedings. Special mention for Robert Burt--- particularly pointed and amusing as Arnalta.",1420329600,3,725,5.359649122807017

8513551,5,B007ATHNJA,"There's some cavilling in these pages about the production and costumes. It's true that the set verges on minimal and the costumes are occasionally perfunctory. But who cares? Given the profound coherence and intelligence of the musical direction, the extraordinary competence of the orchestra, and the (almost) unrelieved strengh of the vocal performances, those considerations seem trivial. Most striking is Danielle de Niese's scorching Poppea (& that's not a term I thought I'd ever be using of a baroque opera). Her style verges on nightclub, or at least as closely on nightclub as is possible in this context. And she looks the part. From the beginning we have no trouble at all in understanding the depth of either Nerone's infatuation or of Ottone's despair. Even the singularly accomplished Jaroussky has a bit of  trouble keeping up with her at times. The single weak vocal moment that I can recall is Katherine Watson's Virt in the prologue, though she recovers nicely as the damigella in the second act. The only other Baroque opera I know of on DVD that is this consistently well sung, directed, and played is the Artaserse with Jaroussky in the title role. So close your eyes if you must, but listen to this performance. You will be amazed.",1405900800,,1254,4.943127962085308
8513552,1,B007ATHNJA,"First of all, I would like to say that my very negative perception of this production does not reflect in any way on signers or orchestra. I bought this DVD because of Jaroussky and Cencic - I love countertenor voices, and these two are just great. It was interesting to hear and see Jaroussky in this role. Certain departure from his innocent, almost angelic looks when he sings sacred works and his most virtuosic arias from castrato repertoire, or a sense of fun and jokes when he sings with Marie-Niicole Lemieux. His Neron was convincingly nasty, so he did manage to get into the character's skin. His singing is never disappointing, and the rest of the cast was great as well. Singers move with a grace, act  and interact in a compelling way.

What is really disappointing is the staging itself, and it just brings down the value of the production in its entirety. There were some decorations, and I guess they were somewhat OK. But some of the costumes were ridiculous beyond belief! I am sure that the stage director had his reasons, because some of the costumes are so peculiar, it could not be just an oversight. But the overall impression, at least to, it borders with a bad taste. Having said so, I must say I am coming from a very different experience. When it comes to Baroque opera, my preference as listener and viewer is certainly to experience historically-informed, fully staged production with proper costumes and decorations. I guess I am spoiled by wonderful productions of Opera Atelier (they presented  Coronation... in 2009 at Elgin Theater in Toronto). Too bad there is no recording of it available on you tube, but to me it is a golden standard of historically informed baroque period production.

I am still happy to have this DVD- solely because of the singer though, because as as whole, this production is a failure.

One more thing, to have some educational value, the DVDs like this should  come with the libretto and some information on historical context. As is, the educational value of this DVD is zero.",1385683200,7,2040,4.748587570621469
8513553,4,B007ATHNJA,"I could have easily rated this production five stars had it not been for one serious distraction. William Christie's musicianship and profound understanding of the work are impeachable, his Les Arts Florissants are as usually excellent, Daniele de Niese and Philippe Yaroussky are superb in the leading roles, other singers are in general good, the stage setting has a good balance of being realistic without falling into the trap of an extravagant Nero's court.
However the major weakness in this production is the silly and absurd costumes that verge on the farcical in this tragic and serious opera. One can focus on the merits of the performance and attempt to ignore the stupid customes, however, it exasperates me that very serious and talented  artists would succumb to the whims of a director with a bizarre taste for ridiculous costumes. Having said that, Pier Luigi Pizzi's general direction and staging are excellent. He arrived to a very subtle mixture of a staged operatic work with a sung performance of this epitome of Monteverdi's operas. I really wish that next time he tackle's an opera he delegates the business of custome design to someone who understands his business.",1343692800,15,1189,5.066326530612245
8513554,2,B007ATHNJA,"When Nerone's costume looks like something Joanne Worley might have worn on Laugh-In, you know you are in trouble. I suppose the idea was to make him resemble a bird of prey, but for me at least it just made him look silly. Philippe Jaroussky gives a fine performance, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't concentrate on his singing. I just kept waiting for him to lay an egg. For the most part, the sets and costumes are not just tasteless but cheap. Nero's guards look like a couple of leather queens who just returned from Folsom Fair.

In fact the whole production seems to suggest that Nero's Rome was an enormous leather dungeon in which the various characters engage in sado-masochistic games with each other. That could in fact be a valid interpretation of this most morally subversive of all operas. Visconti, who understood the Italian Renaissance, might have been able to pull it off. But this production looks more like a road tour of the Addams Family. You have to close your eyes even to begin appreciating the opulence of the score and the wit of the libretto. This is one of the greatest operas ever written, but the first time viewer would be pardoned for not recognizing it as such.

Apart from Jaroussky and Danielle De Niese, the singers are seldom more than adequate. The nurses, who steal the show in other DVDs of the opera, are dull here. As is Ottavia. As is Seneca. Christie's conducting is immaculate, but he cannot redeem the travesty that is taking place on stage. If you want to get a sense of what this opera is about in a fine modern production, I recommend the recent Glyndebourne DVD, in which De Niese also appears as Poppea. The old Peter Hall production with Maria Ewing also holds up well. But avoid this desecration like the plague.",1335398400,20,1777,4.584905660377358
8513555,4,B007ATHNJA,"In my view, this is the best of eight productions of ""Poppea"" that I've seen so far, but it is still not 100% right. It is very difficult indeed to approach the level of perfection of Monteverdi's and Busenello's masterpiece! This production features great music under the direction of William Christie, a very good staging concept by the veteran director/designer Pier Luigi Pizzi, and a rather mixed bag of singers. Philippe Jaroussky as Nerone was the most memorable to me, far removed from the ""angelical"" image that has unfortunately stuck to him. As commented previously by other viewers, the daringly staged duet of Nerone and Lucano (the excellent Mathias Vidal) was the real highlight of this production. Max Emanuel Cencic as Ottone was a pleasant surprise, since I read some negative comments about his performance in this production. Ottone is a thankless role, but Cencic managed to convey the humanity and suffering of this character very well. Notably, the tessitura of this part lies lower than Cencic's normal range, which emphasizes the great technical facility and versatility of this singer. Another pleasant surprise was Ana Quintans as Drusilla. Several singers were very good but predictable, including Danielle de Niese (Poppea), Anna Bonitatibus (Ottavia) and Robert Burt (Arnalta). Some others were not entirely convincing, such as Antonio Abete (Seneca), Suzana Ograjensek (Valetto) and Jose Lemos (Nutrice).
Regarding the staging, I liked the elegant sets, the eclectic costumes that served well to convey the timelessness of the story, and the absence of unwanted stage business. The camera work emphasized the interactions between the singers and the players, so that it looked almost like a semi-staged production (the best way to present a Baroque opera, in my view). A big disappointment was the absence of any informative printed material or of extra features in the DVDs, particularly since it took Virgin two years to produce them! Nevertheless, the production is highly recommended to all the lovers of early opera.",1335312000,28,2052,5.2975460122699385
8513556,5,B007ATHNJA,"This is one of the greatest of all operas and one of the most problematic. Opera as an art form was less than fifty years old when the ageing and terminally ill Monteverdi and the rakish librettist Busenello (and possibly others) staged this morally lax, sexual political bedroom romp full of ambition driven people who appear to have been totally lacking in virtue or have carefully hidden any trace. ""Deh,nasconditi, o Virtu'"" (1643 Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo, Venice). Claudio Monteverdi died a few months after the opening. There are several conflicting manuscripts of this opera but from later dates (1651). This production uses a new edition of the score by Jonathan Cable. No other information is given
I have several versions of this opera both DVDs and CDs and each has some particular outstanding trait or character. For Seneca it's Robert Lloyd in the Maria Ewing DVD but her Poppea is too sentimental. For Ottavia it's Anne Sofie von Otter in the John Eliot Gardiner CD who's lament is truly heart rending but the vehemence and hate in her order to Ottone to kill Popea is frightening. But the two characters who really matter in this opera are Nero and Poppea. The Nero here is Philippe Jaroussky and I think the best of the lot. He brings to this very nasty, self-serving character an air of innate rotteness that comes across in his alto counter-tenor but still gives off enough 17-keto steroids in the voice to let us know that this is a man. His voice has a sneering quality to it and it blends perfectly with that quality in the great star Danielle de Niese. In her previous disc of this role with Emmanuelle Haim conducting and Alice Coote as Nero there was certainly fire and sensuality but a bit too much sliding of notes and rubato of tempo for me. In this disc she is more precise in tone and tempo and I might add she becomes the Poppea of the times. She has mastered nuance and covered deceit wonderfully well. This Poppea can turn her back on a former lover and is now possessed by ambition as was Anna Bolena to come. Nothing matters but to become Empress at any cost. Danielle's stage presence is remarkable. She walks on a crowded stage and no one else is there. She sings with her body as well conveying an unique ability to demand the attention of everybody. She is a wonder to behold.
The Ottavia of Anna Bonitatibus was too old and stiff. Her lament was a disappointment. The Seneca of Antonio Abete was also dull. However the two nurses, Arnalta & Nutrice, and their description of the perils of old age were great. Venice opera at the time had comic parts mixed with dramatic in a presentation. Thus the nurses were played by old men in drag using falsetto. Needless to say the music of Les Arts Florissants with William Christie was right on. What a pleasure to listen to those antique instruments really sing! Pier Luigi Pizzi did the costumes as in the the first DVD I own. Here he is much more austere than the lush extravagance of the previous recording. In all the costumes fit the action more closely although sometimes it look like they had borrowed the dining room drapes. This recording is a great success. Even if you already have several DVDs or CDs invest in this one. Highly recommended.",1333929600,30,3236,4.600346020761246
