2433406,5,B000BOH8WI,I have seen this movie so many times I know all the songs that they sing by heart!,1176163200,5,82,3.611111111111111

2433408,4,B000BOH8WI,"Sweet movie about an ex-con who meets God & gets a full, love-filled life that he never dreamed possible -- up to & including a lot of difficult choices & decisions he never thought he would have to make ...

But, for me, the best part about this movie is that it is a perfect illustration of the kind of whole-life ""make-overs"" that only God can do \o/",1165622400,14,353,4.1911764705882355
2433409,5,B000BOH8WI,"Tommy (Darius McCrary of ""Family Matters"") is desperate to find a job, but no one wants to hire an ex-con. With no family & the only opportunity facing him being that of a drug runner, life doesn't look too promising. Then he meets Memaw (Irma P. Hall), a kind, elderly woman who hears Tommy's beautiful singing voice in the grocery store. What follows is a pleasant tale of how showing God's love can change even the hardest of hearts and that everyone needs a second chance. Also features Tamera Mowry (from ""Sister, Sister"") as Lily.

My husband & I have been looking for good Christian movies to show our youth group, & this definitely falls into that category. The script is well-written & realistic, the acting is excellent (who knew Darius McCrary could sing???), & the story never loses sight of it's goal...love changes people.

This movie will leave a smile on your face & your heart singing. If you're looking for a Christian movie without the B-acting & poor action scenes, this one fits the bill. No heavy end-times theme or confusing plot twists, this movie banks on the simple but life-changing truth of God's love.",1158192000,62,1130,4.730964467005077

2433412,4,B000BOH8WI,"This is a very sweet movie that can be understood and enjoyed by almost everyone in the family. It also teaches very important lessons on witnessing, forgiveness, humility and choices. I saw it on TBN and knew that I had to own a copy.",1141344000,19,235,4.363636363636363

2433448,5,B000BOH8WI,"This is a great movie from the Billy Graham people.  It is the story of a guy, Tommy, involved with the wrong crowd.  There are drugs, girls, violence--but all shown so your Grandmother could watch it.

Also part of the story is an elderly lady, Memaw, who takes an interest in Tommy and attempts to get him involved in church and the choir.  Memaw has a lovely granddaughter, Tamera Mowry-Housley (of Sister, Sister), that Tommy is very interested in.

The story has lots of twists and turns and really keeps your interest.  There is humor, romance and action.  The gospel of Christ is clearly given.  This is one of my favorite Billy Graham movies, and really worth watching. The acting is well-done, and very entertaining.  I recommend it for the entire family, and give it five stars.",1384732800,,788,4.693430656934306

2433450,3,B000BOH8WI,"Although a bit unrealistic in parts, it depicts the street life as a bunch of corny guys running around, with no real danger to speak of. good for 8 year old's and below. but still a good family movie. The guys at the prison will enjoy it.",1383782400,,239,4.1063829787234045

2433457,5,B000BOH8WI,"Arrived promptly and in excellent condition. This is a movie that we previously owned and really enjoyed! It is a family friendly movie but not for little ones in my opinion. It has a wonderful message of God's love and mercy. It shows that nobody's sins are too far from God's forgiveness if you just ask, and that family comes before fame. There are 3 scenes that we don't allow the four year old to watch because of gang/drug related violence. Two of the characters get beat up and in another scene a character gets shot but has a bullet-proof vest on. I still recommend this movie! I purchased 2-one to keep and one was given as a gift.",1325462400,,640,4.38655462184874

I too enjoyed it at 35 so good entertainment and positive message for any age...and that boy can SING!",1265500800,2,299,4.660377358490566
2433475,5,B000BOH8WI,"I watched this last night with my wife and 13 year old, he approached it reluctantly until I told him the kid from ""Family Matters"" and Tamara Mowry from ""Sister, Sister"" was in the movie. He came for the familiar faces, but loved the movie, and wants to see it again. It is very inspiring, and has comedy, music, and the opportunity to watch someone drawn to their faith for the first time and the rewards it brings. Lots of great and well known actors in the movie, and an appearance from gospel great Kirk Franklin, who leads the church choir in the film. There are some other cameos as well, but I do hot want to ruin the suprises.

All in all the movie was great, production and quality was as top notch as anything else we rent. I highly recommend!",1257724800,3,754,4.309859154929577

2433480,5,B000BOH8WI,"Great Christian entertainment right here! I enjoyed the music, of course, and the storyline. The message, that anyone's life can be turned around through the love of Christ, is portrayed in a realistic and practical way. I especially liked the fact that this version had an ""extra"" scene--with G-Smooth in the hospital--that's not on the other DVD (same movie, different cover). Great price too.",1224547200,2,395,5.1875
