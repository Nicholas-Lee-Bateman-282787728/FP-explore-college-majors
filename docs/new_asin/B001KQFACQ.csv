8344351,4,B001KQFACQ,"Big Brother (formerly Deodhar Gandhi) is a good action movie! Only Sunny Deol could pull this one off well. Big Brother is truly the 21st century Ziddi with lots of action (not as explosive as Ziddi but good anyways) and a different plot. Action is good for the most part (a little toning for special effects could help). This movie is a surprise hit at the BO as it really does carry a social message. Recommended for all action fans (especially all Sunny fans)!! I can give this a 9/10! Some things could have been different, but Sunny fans will like it! I look forward to many more great action movies for years to come. All the best Paaji!!",1301443200,,644,4.420168067226891
