1780069,5,B00006J9OV,"As I watched Parsifal I felt grateful to belong to a society which can produce such a performance.

There will always be differences of opinion regarding musical interpretation, stage production, selection of cast, etc., but the number of dedicated (yes, it's still a good word) people involved and the enormous amount of time and resources is stunning to contemplate.

I enjoyed my first viewing/listening and expect to treasure this DVD for a long time. I am quite familiar with the opera, having played it many times (violinist), but seeing it from out front is a completely new experience. Generally it is understood that Wagner was a bit long-winded, and some more judicious cuts could improve the performance. I always thought it was kind of Wagner to write the string parts in the manner he wrote them in the Flower Girl Scene. There are just enough rests that the first violins can quickly turn their heads a see what is happening on stage, and our first violin section did just that in dress rehearsals (we were allowed). The sight was always rewarding, but it is even more so from out front!

Every person who doesn't own this DVD should buy it immediately and watch it/listen to it. It will improve your attitude, I promise.",1207440000,5,1235,4.788732394366197
1780070,5,B00006J9OV,"Levine's 1993 Met performance and Horst Stein's 1981 audience-free Bayreuth production are the only traditional ""Parsifals"" on DVD, so a comparison seems in order. The Bayreuth ""Parsifal"" has very fine singing but is marred by less than involved acting and occasional weak production touches by Wolfgang Wagner. The singing at the Met is just as good, and Otto Schenk's production is far better. The Met scores in terms of scenery, staging and acting. There is a magic in New York that is not there in Bayreuth, which has a more plain, homespun quality, attractive in its own way (similar in that regard to Wolfgang Wagner's ""Bayreuth ""Meistersinger."").

Schenk's handling of characters is just more involving and inviting. Here are seemingly real people facing important issues. Wolfgang Wagner's sense of stage acting comes basically from the stand and deliver school, lacking much compelling interaction between characters to bring the drama to life. The drama here is not exactly gripping; static is more like it.

On its own, the Bayreuth forest that opens acts 1 and 3 is fine, but next to the Met's grand and realistic outdoors, feels a bit cramped and artificial after a while. Bayreuth's second scene of both acts (the hall of the castle of the grail), a la his brother Wieland's 1951-75 production, is abstract yet compelling, too, in its own way. But the Met has a more spiritual setting and a more deeply affecting result.

Act 2 starts out in Bayreuth with Klingsor's castle looking like a cheap science fiction B-movie scene with cheesy-looking smoke, abstract curved pillars on the side and Klingsor dominating from above like a tacky evil superhero. Unconvincing. Laughable even. Sad when Leif Roar is a most compelling Klingsor, full of menace and in vibrant voice. The Met's scenery and staging are more believable, richer in imagery and impression, but Franz Mazura as good as he is, can't compare vocally to Roar, and looks a bit old.

Vocally, both casts are very fine. Each Gurnemanze, the vocal center of the opera, offers rich vocal portrayals, although Wolfgang Wagner has Hans Sotin act rather too condescendingly toward Parsifal in Act 1, losing some of our sympathy. The Met's Kurt Moll is rather more the wise-old grandfatherly type in the spirit of the well-meaning Gurnemanz.

Siegfried Jerusalem is both Parsifals, and his extra 12 years of stage experience shows more strongly at the Met. The voice may be slightly fresher at Bayreuth and his youthful looks a plus, but his Met Parsifal is deeper, more natural and more eloquent.

Bernd Weikl also graces both productions as an outstanding Amfortas. His Wieland Wagner-enforced less-is-more movement at Bayreuth is not a hindrance in this spiritually and physically wracked character, and in some ways is a plus.

Waltraud Meier's Kundry is one of the Met's highlights. She is more fetching and physically expressive than Bayreuth's Eva Randova, well as she sings. Meier brings a sensuality and stronger vocalizing to Kundry that is most compelling.

The conductor comparison surprised me, as I have not been a fan of Levine's Wagner, finding his ""Ring"" protracted and heavy handed. But ""Parsifal"" is a different animal in the Wagner canon; my two favorite audio recordings both come from that master of grand, Knappertsbusch (Bayreuth, 1951 and 1962). Levine, while not quite on his level, brings off a spirituality and conversely, more animation when called for, that the straightforward Stein, who is a good but not overly compelling (similar to what I felt about his Bayreuth DVD ""Meistersinger"").

Levine may unduly stretch tempos now and then, but to my taste, his is a more involved and felt journey than Stein's.  Stein offers a good, solid reading which has the benefit of flow but misses some of Levine's passion and depth.

The drama is more real, believable and interactive in New York than Bayreuth. The sets and staging are more natural and compelling, too. An outstanding release.",1190851200,15,3978,5.0672782874617734
1780071,5,B00006J9OV,"Parsifal is my favorite of Wagner's music-dramas.  It has the most of all of them - Parsifal incorporates Catholic, Buddhist, and mythical themes into an overwhelmingly beautiful story infused throughout with a sense of devotion, piety, and worshipfulness.

The recording here is very good - Levine and the Met Opera Orchestra are in fine form as always.  Siegfried Jerusalem makes a great Parsifal, Bernd Weikl makes a fine Amfortas (though I like Jose van Damm under Karajan better), and Waltraud Meier brings a wonderfully sensuous quality to the role of Kundry.  Kurt Moll really steals the show though as far as singing is concerned, with an incomparable portrayal of Gurnemanz.  The only complaint I can make about the singing is that Franz Mazura sounds really, REALLY old and doesn't successfully bring off the role of Klingsor.

The staging is very traditional - which seems to be hard to find these days - and the video quality is very good.  The DVD menu allows for selections of running subtitles in several languages, including English.",1168819200,21,1049,5.028901734104046
1780072,5,B00006J9OV,"Some years back,a popular PBS crime series ""Inspector Morse"" ended. The inspector in question was a lover of opera and classical music. He suffered a sudden fatal heart attack. As he lay at peace in the hospital bed, the opening bars of the prelude to Wagner's Parsifal played. Momentarily,I was transcended. This ethereal music always has this effect on me.
  I find only 2 problems with the acting in this drama. Vocally,the production is a masterpiece. Waltraud Mier's Kundry wasn't wild enough and Franz Mazura's Klingsor wasn't menacing enough. That said,on to the good stuff!
  The great Kurt Moll as Gurnemanz is the standout here. His voice is so perfect and beautiful. I wish he had recorded a Wotan.
He is a fantastic Sarastro in DG ""The Magic Flute"".
  ActIII is the one I most enjoyed. The healing of Amfortas and the ascension of the former ""fool"" Parsifal to power were breathtaking. With Wagner,it's so much more about the music than the vocals. This music is glorious. The Met Opera orchestra deserves special thanks for this tremendous achievement.",1078790400,39,1065,4.955056179775281
1780073,5,B00006J9OV,"After hearing both the Von Karajan and the Kna performances, but never seeing the Opera in person I bought this DVD after reading the varying reviews listed here. While it is true that both the Von Karajan and the Kna performances are utterly magnificent, they are both different. THIS performance is also magnificent, but again, different from the other 2.
Regarding the tempi, I do not find the tempi too slow, but rather find it a very creatve interpretation and courageous.
The second half of the first act is magnificent musically. True, Jerusalem sort of just stands there, but I prefer to accent the outstanding musical interpretation and ignore the flaws in the acting.
The Second Act is breathtaking. Franz Mazura (Klingsor) is marvelous and the whole scene is just magnificent. The spontaneous clapping at the end does not bother me since I wanted to stand up and cheer too after that act. I guess the New York audience is less conservative than a typical European audience, but I found it wonderful to see an audience reacting with such excitement.
I find the beginning of the Third Act a bit slow after the excitement in the Second Act, but this is personal. The end of the Third act is stunning.
Jerusalem is a wonderful Parsifal and manages to portray the ""child"" image well. Weikl is a great Amfortas. While he didn't sing like he is in pain, but looking closely his watering mouth and sweating face, he portrays his condition well. Moll is fantastic as Gurnemanz, and of course Meier is a an outstanding Kundry.
The sound and the sets are really fabulous.
Perhaps some of the other reviewer have already seen a performance of Parsifal. I never had that experience. I wat not disappointed and I constantly watch sections that I especially enjoy over and over.
I highly recommend this DVD set. If you have heard another performance, you might need to keep an open mind because this performance is different and does not try to be Von Karajan or Kna. However, this performance holds its own as being no less magnificent then the other 2.",1047427200,50,2050,4.745098039215686
1780074,4,B00006J9OV,"There is a lot about this DVD that I love, from the opening footage of Lincoln Center to the ascension of the chandeliers, the stage settings, the extraordinarily convincing acting, the wonderfully clear sound. However, Levine, perhaps seeking to emulate Hans Knappertsbusch in choice of a ""langsam"" tempo, actually comes off in the opening prelude and several times throughout as sounding as though he has lost his place. Where Kna would draw out the essence, the twilight, the mystique inherent in the mysticism in this wonderful opera, Levine's mob seems to just stop at points. And maybe it's me, but on video, he looks down at the score, so maybe, just maybe, he did forget. Maybe it's a cultural thing. New York tends to overwhelm whatever it does, that sometimes the more subtle and fragile essences are lost.
That should send most New Yorkers into a frenzy. Anyway, Parsifal had its first performance outside of Bayreuth in NY with the Met, so the return in 1993 was a return effected with an homage to, though not a replication of, the directions the composer had issued for the production. The scenery is great. As you watch the singers perform, they inhabit their roles with conviction. Lighting is dramatic. In fact the whole experience is very much one of great wonder and joy to be part of. On DVD, it sparkles!
I am likely ruined by Kna's 1962 performance, made in the certain knowledge that he was dying himself. On CD, that is the performance to own. You will feel your heart being pulled from your chest. The essence of the philosophical issues and the human questions presented in the music and text were cleared and presented by an artist as iconclastic, independent and as visionary as anyone to ever take up the baton. The orchestra and the singers knew the drama on the page and from the podium and played and sang as I've never heard in any other production.
How could NY hope to match that? You would have to be German and would have to have lived in Kna's soul. All the same, this is a remarkable document of a work that asked so many questions about the nature of one's heart and soul. I enjoyed this enormously and would think that all lovers of this opera will find elements to embrace passionately in this production.",1040083200,20,2247,4.662468513853904
1780075,5,B00006J9OV,"There are currently only two versions of Parsifal available on DVD and this video of a Metropolitan Opera production is better musically than Hans-Jrgen Syberberg's movie version which is lip-synched by actors as well as opera singers.  While Syberberg's movie is more politically and sexually charged (the flower maidens are naked) and his sets are quite imaginative, the Prague Philharmonic doesn't match the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra nor do the singers come up to the Met's cast.
This video is of a March 1992 production at the MET.  The sets are naturalistic and conservative but very impressive.  Having seen the production live I can say that the video does a good job of capturing it.  Audience noise is minimal but the crowd insists on clapping before the music stops at the end of Act II - a regular, if annoying, ritual at the MET. Some portions of the orchestral shots appear to have been made without an audience present - the spectacular camera angles taken from a boom hovering over the orchestra could never haven been filmed during an actual performance.  A minor quibble - the offstage chorus at the end of Act I sounds off the beat and out of tune.  They are better at the end of Act III.
The SOUND on this DVD is superb.  It is offered in PCM stereo, DOLBY DIGITAL, and DTS.  Playback in DOLBY DIGITAL is natural with deep but not obtrusive bass; also there is no artifically distracting audio coming from the rear speakers.  Presumably DTS is even better but I don't have it.
The picture is free of video artifacts, colors natural, and the image is especially detailed in scenes where the cameras were precisely in focus (quite a feat during a live opera production). Annoying was a break in the audio along with a jump in the picture in the middle of Act I on disc 1 and near the end of the orchestral prelude to Act III on disc 2.  I believe this is indicative of the laser beam moving from one layer of the disc to another and may not be noticeable on newer DVD players.  But the one in Act III could have been more judiciously placed.
The big question is LASER DISC versus DVD. Comparing the two with an S-video connection activated (I don't have component video) the DVD version is sharper (you can clearly see the notes on the music sheets in the orchestra) and MOST IMPORTANT, free of video noise - little white and colored dots that show up in particularly dark scenes. Sonically the DOLBY DIGITAL is not that noticable a difference over the LASER sound - if it were it would probably create too obtrusive a bass response.  If you own the LASER you probably spent $60 for it several years ago and are wondering if the DVD is worth it.  If you want a artifact-free picture, it definitely is.",1036195200,102,2721,4.562628336755647

The music flows throughout the entire performance evoking a rich sense of beauty, adventure, sacredness, good vs evil, and everything in between. Some people may find it a little slow or boring, so if you're after fast-paced excitement look elsewhere.

1780116,4,B00006J9OV,"At present, there are three versions of Parsifal on DVD worthy of consideration: this one, the 1981 Bayreuth version conducted by Horst Stein (see the previous review here by Bob Epstein), and the recently released 1998 Bayreuth performance conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli that I have reviewed elsewhere. Each has its pros and cons, which I will briefly summarize as follows.

The Met production easily has the most beautiful staging, designed by Otto Schenck, who also produced the fabulous set for the Met's previous Ring cycle.  The characters' costumes are likewise the most naturalistic and attractive. Kurt Moll is a wonderful Gurnemanz, but compared to his studio recording under Karajan a decade earlier it has lost some of its original velvety body and luster.  As Parsifal, Jerusalem is starting to show some wear and tear on his voice at the Met in 1992 as opposed to his prime form at Bayreuth in 1981, but is still quite good; only Placido Domingo could compete with him in the role at that time.  Much the same can be said for Bernd Weikl as Amfortas: he is preferable at Bayreuth in 1981 to the Met in 1992, as there is some audible wear and tear on the voice with age, though again he is still decent overall.  Unfortunately, Franz Mazura (an actor who took up a few opera roles) is simply awful as Klingsor; he rasps and snarls with his wobbly, dessicated voice, but hardly sings a single note.  However, Waltraud Meier is arguably the best Kundry on DVD, and one of the best in any medium, a truly great artist who has the full measure of this tortuous role.  Somewhat oddly, though, she and Jerusalem do not strike the sparks off one another in Act II that one would expect, seeming slightly distant instead.  The chorus and orchestra are top-notch.  Levine's conducting is famously slow, but he only really gets bogged down at a couple of points; otherwise the score bears his approach well.

As for the competition -- the 1981 Bayreuth production under Horst Stein has the best singing but the least desirable staging.  As already mentioned, Jerusalem and Weikl are in prime form there, with Hans Sotin providing a beautifully sung Gurnemanz with a lighter voice a shade less refulgent than that of Moll, and Leif Roar as a first-class Klingsor who conveys all the menace of his part while singing (rather than barking) every note.  Eva Randova is also a fine Kundry; contrary to the claims of some critics she does not have a wobble in her voice, though sometimes it is hard-pressed and one can hear the stress -- but then, that also fits the part well.  Stein provides a brisk account of the score (only 240 minutes!), the antipode of Levine (a good 30 minutes slower); some might find him too prosaic, but I do not.  Unfortunately the sets, while not nonsensical, are rather drab and uninviting, with e.g. one or two tiny saplings standing in for an entire forest.  There is also a bit of nonsense near the end where the Grail Knights are are made to turn on Amfortas and seek to kill him, instead of drawing back from him in distress as the libretto directs.

The sets for the 1998 Sinopoli/Bayreuth version are quite striking and effective; despite the use of abstract colored panels for the woodland scenes, they actually succeed in creating a real sense of a dark, richly hued forest.  The costumes likewise are more abstractly stylized but generally effective (except for the suits given to the knights in the Act I Grail scene, which look more like something out of ""Star Wars""); those for Stein/Bayreuth are passable but not more.  Hans Sotin is again an superb Gurnemanz; age haa deepened his vocal texture, but there is no loss of vocal sheen or control.  Poul Elming is an excellent Parsifal, in his all-too-brief prime before his voice became overtaxed and went to seed; his sound is a bit more baritonal than that of Jerusalem.  While Falk Struckmann is a singer I generally do not care for -- too often his vibrato is not under control -- here he is in his best form with minimal defects, with a voice that is darker and more anguished, if not always as steady, as that of Weikl. Ekkehard Wlaschiha (the potent Alberich of the Met Ring under Levine) has the character of Klingsor down pat, but his voice has dried out and hardened to an unpleasant degree, though he is vastly superior to Mazura.  Linda Watson is quite good as Kundry in her  likewise short-lived prime, but she does not have either Meier's magnetism or Randova's intensity, and has the further disadvantage of a somewhat more ample physique.  Sinopoli offers an account of the score as slow or slower than Levine (except for a positively manic opening to Act II), but with superior pacing.  In both Bayreuth productions the chorus and orchestra naturally excel.

Taking the casts as overall totalities, for singing I would rank Bayreuth 1981 first as having no weak spots and some very considerable strengths, followed by Bayreuth 1998 and finally the Met in 1992, with the Klingsors making the single biggest difference. When it comes to the conducting, I would rank Sinopoli first, then Stein, and Levine a very distant third.

In the end, your choice between these three versions (if you choose to have only one) will depend on the weight you attach to various factors. For the stagings, costumes, and best Gurnemanz and Kundry, go with the Met. For the performance with the best overall singing (including the best Parsifal, Amfortas, and Klingsor) and the most animated conducting, go with Bayreuth 1981. For a performance that strikes a happy medium between those two in virtually every respect, go with Bayreuth 1998. Or else, do the right right thing, spoil yourself, and get all three.

A postscript -- can anyone explain how a dozen or more reviews of the 1981 Bayreuth performance got posted on this listing instead?  It confuses the discussion thread and skews the ratings!",1367193600,15,5888,4.768700787401575

Although Siegfried Jerusalem is no Jonas Kaufmann, he held up extremely well and Kurt Moll and Bernd Weikl can take it up with the best Gurnemanzes and Amfortases. As for Waltraud Meier she is simply extraordinary - both in looks, acting and singing. To me, she alone would be worth the price of admission.

Another reviewer mentioned there is not one single aria that stood out...how true!  There may be brilliant moments here and there in this opera ...but otherwise for ME, the music just wanders on and on.

I am not qualified to comment on the performances of the singers - but in my opinion, they all did their best, and they all have WONDERFUL voices.  It was the opera, not the singers that I personally have difficulty with.

I have made the decision that Verdi, Puccini, and Rossini operas are much better operas for ME, as I just prefer the style.

I received a great suggestion from Esteban:

If you are not familiar with Wagner operas, perhaps it might be best to start with one of his earlier operas such as Lohengrin.  And as you become more familiar with Wagner's style, you can always work up to his later operas.  What a great and very Logical suggestion !!",1357862400,,948,4.529411764705882

As, usual, Levine and the others responsible for this version, showed understanding and respect for Wagner's work and intentions.  The main problem I have with other recordings available is they interpret things, either knowingly or unknowingly, which change the meaning of the work or sometimes make a complete mockery of it.  Kundy's death, written by Wagner, and actually portrayed here, is essential to the story.  There is no way around it and any director who thinks they can play the ""feminist"" and have Kundry live, simply doesn't get it.

Besides that, the scenery is beautiful, the costumes great and Levine and the orchestra do a very admirable job.  The casting seems perfectly appropriate to me, which may be luck, as finding the right looking people for opera roles is not something you can count on.

7970181,5,B00006J9OV,My favorite opera by Wagner. Outstanding rendition of this classic.,1478390400,,67,5.8
7970182,5,B00006J9OV,"I recently took advantage of the Metropolitan Opera's offer for access to videos and past performances. I loved the look of this opera which was bright, beautifully lit and with an excellent contrast. So I ordered this only to have it appear more as the videos as would be seen on youtube, darker and ever so slightly blurred. I'm certain someone well educated in the reasons why this may be so could explain it, but apparently it is what it is.
Still an awesome performance from all involved. While Meier's voice swallowed Jerusalem's in Tristan, here the two do not sing together so it is not a problem. And no one can match Bernd Weikl as Amfortas. His face is so expressive, matching the text beautifully. Jerusalem sings ""nur eine waffe taugt"" with a dignity the moment requires. Wonderful.",1471737600,2,795,4.726618705035971
7970183,5,B00006J9OV,"All I'm going to say is that this performance and production comes as close ideal as you will ever encounter.  I don't think there exists a video of any Wagner opera which is so faithful to Wagner's intentions and not substituting them with some idiot stage director's demented vision..

Compared to this glowing theatrical represention, the recent MET production is revealed as a complete and total joke.",1461369600,,405,5.029850746268656
7970184,5,B00006J9OV,Watching this video was like being back at the Met!,1457568000,,51,4.2
7970185,4,B00006J9OV,"As has been noted elsewhere this is a very traditional production: the staging, costumes and lighting might well have worked for a performance a hundred years ago or anywhere in the intervening years. Done in the gloomy, naturalistic style in favor at Bayreuth till the early Thirties, this production has little (nothing?) in common with the stark New Bayreuth style of Wieland Wagner or Francois Girards much more recent brittle, post-apocalyptic take done at the Met a couple of years ago.

The principals do a fine job but Im especially partial to Waltraud Meiers Kundry. She sings wonderfully and shes a most convincing interpreter of Wagner's ultimate femme fatale, quite possibly the most beautiful Kundry since Martha Mdl. Siegfried Jerusalem in the title role strikes a commanding figure onstage and his singing is fine. However, hes a tad old for the role, but this could be said about many tenors who have sung Wagner.

Theres little to criticize in Levines conducting or the performance of the Met orchestra and chorus, though Levines slowish tempos may not be to all tastes. As other reviewers have pointed out, the DVDs visual quality is less than ideal and not up to todays standards. This Parsifal has many virtues, but I rate the recent Gatti/Girard Met DVD just a little better in all respects, and as a result my first choice.",1450137600,,1345,4.920704845814978
7970186,5,B00006J9OV,This opera is the last opera that Richard Wagner composed before he died. It has some of Wagner's most beautiful music in it. The Good Friday Spell music is especially ethereal and heavenly.,1449878400,,190,4.787878787878788
7970187,5,B00006J9OV,Outstanding DVD,1447372800,,15,7.0
7970188,4,B00006J9OV,"Great performance which I saw several times at the Met. The singers all first rate. Levine's slow pacing grows on you.
Only criticism regards the DVD. At loud volumes, especially on iPad or portable DVD players there is audio distortion. E.G., Amfortas' outbursts in the first act Grail Ceremony. Maybe it is just my copy, but DG is usually such a reliable company re: quality control.",1431043200,,385,4.848484848484849
