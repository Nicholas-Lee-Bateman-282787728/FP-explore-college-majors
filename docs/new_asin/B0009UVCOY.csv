2323462,5,B0009UVCOY,"Dangerous Intentions is a movie about a man who hates potato salad. On a seemingly calm day, his wife attempts to slip some potato salad by him on the dinner table, in the hopes that he will either not notice, or simply realize that the potato salad isn't for him. This does not go over well at all. Upon seeing the potato salad, he proceeds to beat her within an inch of her life, breaking almost every window in the kitchen during the process. He leaves her there, crying in a pool of her own blood, in a totally devastated kitchen that she knows will be her mess to clean.

In the second act of the movie, we see that his wife has since relocated, and is living with her parents. She tells them of the years of physical and mental abuse she has had to endure, which Corbin Bernsen tries to defuse with the counter-accusation that she had thrown a bowl of potato salad at him. An accusation that is not only untrue, but a very flimsy excuse for turning your wife's face into a mashed-in side of beef, if you ask me. But, then again, I'm not a potato-salad-hating Corbin Bernsen with dangerous intentions.

The rest of the movie is completely unwatchable, aside from a few scenes where Corbin Bernsen is featured, and a hilariously executed scene where the wife's new friend, a fellow punching bag, played by Robin Givens, gets stabbed by her ex-boyfriend in front of about ten witnesses that do nothing but try to remember where they know Robin Givens from. The director's attempts to make you somehow relate to and/or empathize with the wife in this movie are entirely overshadowed by the fact that the first ten minutes of footage was Corbin Bernsen tossing pots and pans around, screaming, ""I HATE POTATO SALAD."" But if you ever happen to see this movie just starting, which will most likely take place on a Sunday afternoon on the Lifetime Movie Network, definitely try to catch the first act. It's amazing to see how much one man can dislike potato salad.",1219276800,11,1962,4.53954802259887

I was also a victim of violent spousal abuse in the 1970s - with constant threats to murder me and destroy my face to make identification impossible. My little girl had serious medical problems, but I had no family in the US.and there were no women's shelters at that time. Restraining orders were not served because my husband's family was influential in the community.  It was an absolutely  terrifying period.from which we were only able to escape after my husband punched my daughter in the face, giving her a black eye, and I reported it to the police.

2323522,5,B0009UVCOY,"Dangerous Intentions tackles a tough topic, so Ill preface this review by stating its a good film thats nonetheless difficult to watch.

Donna Mills plays Beth Williamson, a woman who at the films opening is struggling to salvage what is clearly an untenable marriage. Her husband Tom Williamson, played by Corbin Bernsen, is the sort of man parents warn their daughters to watch out for and warn their sons to never become. Presenting one face in public and a far more menacing face in private, hes a Doctor Jekyll Mister Hyde character with misogynist and increasingly violent behavior. Its made clear from the outset that Beth, if not for their young daughter, would have left him years ago.

Before diving into the meat, Ill admit this isn't the sort of movie Id usually watch. I know theres a huge market for it  just flip on the Lifetime channel at any time of day and its obvious the Battered Woman narrative is alive and well, usually with a third act Revenge Plot  but its never held any special allure for me. I don't like torture porn (never went in for Saw or similar the later clones), and torture porn is exactly how Id label these sort of movies. Lets watch a woman get verbally assaulted and slapped around for ninety minutes is not my idea of quality entertainment. I have to admit, I question what sort of perverse, underlying subconscious desire these stories sate, and wonder at the state of our collective mental health that theyve become so wildly popular. They essentially monetize the suffering of women in violent domestic situations, without  in my opinion  offering any insight into the issue or even shedding light on the problem through exposure. We all know spousal abuse exists; its not a shocking expose by any stretch.

Furthermore, having had close friends who suffered abuse (sometimes for years before escaping), it brings to mind only painful memories for me personally.

So the question with Dangerous Intentions is simple: is it torture porn? Is it an entertaining narrative employing as its central plot element a well known struggle for countless millions of women across the globe, or is it exploitation?

My final opinion was that Dangerous Intentions didn't exploit the issue any more than a WWII film exploits the deaths of millions in human historys single most bloody moment. Especially as it moved into the second act (when Beth, after surviving a violent assault, finally musters the courage to leave her husband), Dangerous Intentions departs from abuse porn. Tom Williamson stalks her and her child as they attempt to escape his clutches, which moves into solid thriller territory following the inciting incident of the last straw attack.

Nonetheless, it doesnt make it any easier to watch. Though I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, writing, acting... even the barebones, borderline depressing style cinematography, which perfectly sets the oppressive and bleak tone  I was left feeling a little queasy, even shaken, as the credits roll. Keep in mind, my nerves have never been described as weak: as a combat veteran, I think its safe to say I can and have stomached frayed nerves without experiencing literal, physiological discomfort. That fact alone is one reason Ill only recommend the movie with the caveat that you know what you're getting in for.

The fact that the movie left me so shaken if anything speaks to solid character building. Beth Williamson makes for a startlingly effective protagonist as we watch her move from passive to active, realizing her marriage and her husband are both beyond redemption and taking the plunge to leave him despite the danger. We see her taking all the necessary steps towards this epiphany  rationalizing staying, first, for her childs sake, then seeking counsel and admitting to her friends whats going on, all the way to her final departure  and during the middle build she becomes an increasingly strong character. Forced into isolation, were treated to the full scope of the heros journey as Beth is forced to rely on her own wit and guile to survive her husbands twisted attempt at either reconciliation or revenge.

Tom as well makes for a compelling antagonist. I wouldnt describe his as three-dimensional  he is a monster in every sense, and the writers make no effort to explore the why behind it  but as an abusive husband hes a chillingly accurate portrayal with acceptable nuance. Tom utilizes the abusers full arsenal, ranging from verbal tactics by belittling and gas-lighting to and isolating, escalating all the way to brutal physical force. Contrasted with his smooth-talking and various justifications for his behavior, he was a textbook example of an abusive spouse, drummed up to dramatic extremes as befits the medium.

I wouldnt recommend Dangerous Intentions to just anyone. Certainly not to anyone whos survived abuse, or is close to someone who has, which (considering the sad state of society) may limit the potential audience. But as a thriller it hits all the marks and genre conventions, and thankfully it did not, as I had originally feared, turn out to be ninety minutes of women-beating. Without encroaching into gratuitous exploitation, it chills and thrills where it aims to, and as a story stirs the emotions without the use of cheap tricks.

Enjoy Dangerous Intentions for what it is  a pulse-pounding thriller  but just be aware its riffing off a sensitive subject, and isn't for everyone.",1479686400,9,5422,4.995560488346282

2323658,5,B0009UVCOY,very good movie. i watched it immediately after getting it.the lady who played the abused wife was very believable. through out the entire film i was rooting for her. i was hopeing hed die. i hated her step mother. the woman just kept on the abusers side and kept helping him.it also sucked that witness protection kicked her out of it. they knew how much danger she was in.it did not surprise me that the husband wanted to kill the wife and daughter at the end. being its based off a true story i wonder what happened to the real woman and her daughter this is based off after all this. he was arrested in the end of the movie but you read what it says after words and find out he got out in 1995. i wonder if he finaly got to them and killed them. they need to go further into this. make a special about them.i hate that some men abuse women.these men are loosers. haveing them go to classes among other abusers doesnt help. like in this one they learn what to say to make people believe they changed.great movie,1437609600,,1014,4.231958762886598

2323663,5,B0009UVCOY,"This is a great movie-- it ""brings home""  the horrors of spousal abuse.  I saw it, a few years ago, and am glad that I was able to purchase it for my video library.  You can get some videos from Amazon that you can't get anywhere else.",1395360000,,235,3.9574468085106385
2323664,4,B0009UVCOY,"After years of being terrorized, Beth Williamson(Donna Mills) finally finds the courage to leave her abusive husband, but where can she go that's safe? Her parents' home, her sister's - wherever Beth tries to hide, her husband finds her and beats her, each attack more savage than the last.

Only when she meets Kaye, another battered wife on the run, does the nightmare look like it's coming to an end. Looking out for each other, the 2 of them set up home with their children, but when Kaye's violent husband reappears, a confrontation ends in murder, forcing Beth to choose between coming forward as a witness or staying safe among the 'disappeared'...",1391040000,2,655,4.848214285714286
2323665,5,B0009UVCOY,"The story of a battered woman and I imagine the story of a lot of battered women. First there's the stepmother who couldn't understand the problem but the father understood and was ready to kill the husband played by Corbin Berson (sp?). From shelter to shelter to shelter, to live in fear every day, to watch your back, I can't imagine living that kind of life.  One day my husband threw me across the room during an argument and then cornered me in the bathroom and started pinching me (hurt like hell). The next day I called my lawyer dad and asked him to start divorce papers. I was scared, afraid, concerned (I had a daughter under two) but I wasn't going to stick around and let this get any further. He left, my life changed for the better, got a job and lived a normal happy life until I met the man of my dreams (32 years wed). So there is hope ladies-don't put up with this sh.t--get out while the gettin's good-at the first time of violence. You'll be glad you did. I don't mean to make light of the situation as in this story but there are options, underground shelters, family who may help.....just get out and get help; it's out there!!!  Good luck!",1390953600,7,1163,4.354838709677419

2323667,5,B0009UVCOY,one of the reasons this movie is so good is because it really can happen and probably has it arrived on time and in good condition thank you,1389052800,,140,4.035714285714286
2323668,4,B0009UVCOY,"When I first saw this movie, I never thought how violent domestic abuse can be. Corbin Bernsen played the abuser strikingly well and Donna Mills the victim, just the same. It hurts when this happens, and you feel for the child who grows up in such environment, like I did.",1386979200,,272,4.46
2323669,5,B0009UVCOY,Very good portrayal of a true story & does a good job of illustrating what goes on in the mind of an abuser and the victim.  Excellent acting by both Donna Mills and Corbin Bernson.  Very absorbing & worth watching (if you can).,1380672000,,228,4.27906976744186

2323672,5,B0009UVCOY,"This is a great movie about the trials of a battered woman and her child at the hands of her abusive husband.  It details the efforts of one woman to provide a safe haven for her and her daughter, and the lengths her husband will take to keep her in his control.  This movie has a lot of twists and turns, and it keeps the viewer involved.  An excellent movie with superb acting!",1362960000,2,379,4.164383561643835

2323675,5,B0009UVCOY,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. THE ACTORS & ACTRESSES WERE TERRIFIC & IT WAS A SUSPENSE/DRAMA. IT ACTUALLY KEPT YOU AT THE EDGE OF YOU SEAT AS TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT.,1335657600,3,167,4.25
2323676,5,B0009UVCOY,Great movie about being in an abusive situation. Donna Mills  was great in this movie . Can be inspired for someone to gain her strengh to get out and stay gone or stand and fight.,1333670400,,180,4.142857142857143
2323677,5,B0009UVCOY,"This is an absolute treasure for movie watchers and collectors as well as its based on a true story of women who are abused in marriages and I,m glad i brought this dvd. Many would not know what it is like to be in the same situation or where to turn and for that mother I really feel for, More movies of both sexes as it happens to men that get abused as well should be told and maybe society should be made more aware of this instead of it be hidden like it has been for years. Maybe with this type of thing going on the abuser will stop and think better before acting in temper. The story line could not have been better and the acting was not overdone. A movie not to be missed and worth buying.",1270857600,16,699,4.0
8067122,5,B0009UVCOY,Great Movie! I feel bad for the women and children that go through this horrible treatment. The only issue I had with the movie was the audio seemed  to have white noise from time to time in the background making it sound like an airplane was flying over head. But besides that their was great acting by the lead actor and lead actress!,1525910400,,336,4.333333333333333

8067126,3,B0009UVCOY,"While this movie addresses a very serious and prevalent topic, it was very predictable. I am in no way attempting to belittle or make light of the subject, I am only speaking regarding the movie plot itself. The movie Shameful Secrets has a nearly identical plotline (seriously... Google it.). The only real difference between this movie and Shameful Secrets, was that the main character in Shameful Secrets had two children and their custody battle was given more showtime in the plot. Everything, even down to befriending a black woman at the shelter for battered women, was the same. Just the same as in Dangerous Intentions, the black woman that the main character befriends is attacked by her abuser again, and it pushes the lead to take more action against her own husband. This movie can be hard to watch at times, because we all know that there are women everywhere, everyday, going through this same type of ordeal. I personally would not watch this movie again or recommend it, but it is a decent movie!",1519171200,,1013,4.7942857142857145
8067127,4,B0009UVCOY,"This made for television movie is well made, and it is certainly worth your time to watch this movie. You might think this movie is dated, but it isn't. Each year, heck each month we hear of women being abused and living in fear of the husband that they have left in fear of their lives. Has it gotten any better? No. It hasn't. The abuse cycle continues, and the murders of abused wives continue, and this nation doesn't seem to get a handle of how to solve this crime.",1515283200,,470,4.233333333333333
8067128,4,B0009UVCOY,"This is a powerful true story about one family's abuse. This isn't just another movie, it shows the mechanics of abuse, bit by bit, and they got it right. This film shows how an innocent wife and child struggle to get away from an abusive husband and father. Unfortunately, many women don't realize that they are being abused, they just think ""o he's had a rough day"" or ""he gets mad because he loves me"" or ""he's just that way"" or ""that's just how we fight""... but if you are SCARED of the man - you are being ABUSED. Take steps before it is too late. These stories NEVER end well. Protect yourself and your children. Get help!. You are not alone! You deserve to be loved and respected, to be cared for and adored. Don't let anyone bring you down, don't let anyone hurt you. NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO HURT YOU. Run from a man immune to your tears. Get out of the hell you're in if you can understand every aspect of this movie about domestic violence. Don't let your children see this horror, don't let them become victims. You have the POWER TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE. I pray for you Beautiful, you are STRONG. Leave an abuser.",1512432000,,1121,4.2924528301886795

I watched this movie back in 1995 with my grandmother. I'm glad I found it on DVD on Amazon.",1507939200,,112,3.9130434782608696
8067131,5,B0009UVCOY,"Even though this was made over 20 years ago it is a good movie. Too many women live in fear of their spouse or boyfriend. It shows what life is like, it is faster paced, that it is not showing all the beatings but gets into the system and all. I had my daughter watch it with me to understand how sick people can be and that no one deserves this. Also to hopefully show her what not to choose in a man.",1507420800,,402,3.855421686746988
