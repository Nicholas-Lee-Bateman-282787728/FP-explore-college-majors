8542541,5,B009KKLQP4,"Excellent, fun martial arts based workout - lots of technique and not for beginners - if you are looking for a good entry level kickboxing workout try Tiffany Chen's Kung Fu Kickboxing workout then after a few dozen workouts give Cardio Karate a try. I have been doing Les Mills Body Combat and Core De Force the past year or so and this workout would fit right in as an advanced workout for either of those programs. My only complaint is this is not karate - which is fine, but could be misleading - this is mainly Chinese arts based, which I personally enjoy but it's not MMA or kickboxing - more traditional and a fairly esoteric tradition at that! If you want a karate cardio workout, try and find a copy of Karate Fit (Yamazato Productions). I would definitely recommend this workout and will recommend it to my friends.",1489708800,,825,4.506666666666667
8542542,4,B009KKLQP4,Im terrible with choreography but he puts it together a step or two at a time. Once its all together its still too fast for me. Ive haven't done martial arts before. I like the dvd though. Gets my heart rate up.  My son is seven and a white belt. Im 31. We did half an hour together.,1453593600,,283,3.8793103448275863
8542543,2,B009KKLQP4,"Nice change of pace from the usual workout DVD. I see they're coming out with another one which I ordered. The low review is because they didn't give out too much information on it, as well as the other one, so I hope didn't just by the same DVD, even though they said the other one was longer...and cheaper, but not by much...about $3.00.",1355529600,,339,4.3125
