2423591,3,B000BM5P7A,"The only reason I rated this is superb series 3 stars is because of the exorbitant price Amazon has the audacity to charge.

I was introduced to ""Wind At My Back"" on INSP.  It is a wonderful family series.  Set in Canada gives a different pleasant perspective from traditional American television programs.  The ""catty"" characters are written as wonderful antithesis to the charitable kind characters.

Lower the price Amazon & this series might go on my Wish List.",1316390400,,465,4.910256410256411
2423592,5,B000BM5P7A,"I love this story line.  Children weren't desensitized with television and computers.  Childhood obesity was practically nil.  If you were a child of the forties or fifties you had to run and play and imagine.  What better childhood could anyone have had. Growing up with ""it's the right thing to do"" and a conscience of all things. I would always want to know a person like that.  Anyway, that's my take on it.  I love this series.",1310342400,,432,4.545454545454546
2423593,5,B000BM5P7A,"We love the ""Wind at My Back"" series and look forward to seeing all of the seasons.  I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys good wholesome stories, especially in a time when such are so difficult to find.",1292976000,3,211,4.410256410256411
2423594,5,B000BM5P7A,"I cannot say enough good things about this series (total of 5 yrs, plus Christmas episode).  The series is a good, clean viewing for anyone.  Each episode is so well written, the characters and the scenery depicting the Depression Era, is supurb.  Loved each and every episode.  Loaned to friends and they are ""hooked!!!""  Cannot say enough good things about this - Love it!",1285027200,3,374,4.78125
2423595,5,B000BM5P7A,"If you like Anne of Green Gables, Road to Avonlea, you will like this even more!! This is great, it has many REAL life lessons, it has all ages acting in it, so it will attract all ages too. We care to have clean movies with good lessons so we can all watch as a family. My teen age children did not want to watch it in the beginning, but once they saw the first episode they asked me to get the whole seasons. We are in the fifth season now and it is so nice and heartwarming  when we all gather as a family and watch one episode every night.",1283040000,,543,3.891891891891892
2423596,5,B000BM5P7A,The series continues to improve in the 2nd season. Very well done. The attention to detail is on a par with the Avonlea series. You will like this series. We are now in the 3rd season.,1257120000,,184,4.138888888888889
2423597,5,B000BM5P7A,"They are set back in the depression I have bought the 5 set series. They are filmed in Canada written and produced by the Sullivan Family, they make excellent movies for family entertainment. I love these movies and I got the series set's of Avonlea, buy them you will love all of them.",1244160000,,286,4.415094339622642
2423598,3,B000BM5P7A,"This series deserves FIVE STARS, but the price asked for it here is nothing short of egregious--that's the only reason the program is getting demerits from me.

Head over to sullivanboutique.com, the original producers of the series, and grab yourself the first two seasons for less than what they are asking here for the first season alone.

Some other distributor has scarfed up the rights to seasons three, four and five, I have heard, and supposedly they will be available in the fall of 2008 at some retailers, both brick and mortar and online.

 I wish AMAZON would put them up for pre-order (at a more acceptable price than they're offering for the first two seasons, of course).

Anyway, for those interested in the series, it's a heartwarming family program, made in Canada, about a young widow and her children going through considerable trial and tribulation during the Great Depression in a Canadian mining town.  There's a tough-as-nails Granny, cute kids, assorted ""local flavor"" town characters, and a storyline that keeps you riveted.  Great costuming and sets, too.  No cussin' or naughty bits on display, so it can be watched by the kiddies and those family members on a day excursion from the convent or monastery!

 This really is some fine family programming--but don't pay this much for it.  If you're rich and can afford to throw your money away, buy it from the source and send the money you've saved to a charity aiding the poor.

  You can do much better on the price than this.",1217289600,7,1504,4.801556420233463

2423607,5,B000BM5P7A,"I think when I did a review for the first season I had done it prematurely and did not express the totality of my fondness for this program, so I will do that now with the second season. My family and I look forward to our time spent together watching this show that consistantly proves itself to be endearing,entertaining, thought provoaking and wonderful.
