7870775,5,6304432739,"The episode of the overboard and sinking Hyacinth can be found in ""How to Enhance Your Husband's Retirement.""  If you have a really hard time finding the tape, it may be found on Yahoo shopping.  This is a great  episode.",1026345600,,221,4.475
7870776,4,6304432739,"As good as this was, I am still looking for episode in which Hyacinth surprises Richard for their anniversary. The ""yacht"" turns out to be an old tug and when they board her, it sinks, leaving Hyacinth flailing around in the river with her dress over her head. I have purchased many sets and still unable to locate this episode. I unfortunately do not know the title of it. Any help is appreciated.",1006041600,,398,4.465753424657534
7870777,2,6304432739,"This largely unsatisfying outing has been mistaken for a fabulous introduction to the series.  This is as fallacious as saying that the _Happy Days_ episode where they showed clips from other episodes is a great  way to meet the Fonz.
This is definitely no way to first meet Hyacinth  Bucket.  No, this is a way for the BBC to make some quick cash off of  unsuspecting fans of the show.  The way to meet her is as we all did:  get  a full-length episode and work from there.
Now, what's different about  British comedy from American is that it doesn't really matter which episode  you choose.  With few exceptions, characters don't really change and mature  in British comedies.  Unllike, say, M*A*S*H, where characters come and go,  and Hotlips undergoes significant character metamorphosis from the first  season to the last, Hyacinth is the same each episode, with many of the  same scenes being replayed in each episode.
So, feel free to choose  blindly from other _Keeping Up Appearances_ videos.  You won't find a bad  one, outside of this one, in the lot.",955065600,11,1062,4.767955801104972

You'll definitely want to see every episode in full after viewing this  video!",950486400,7,444,5.0
7870779,5,6304432739,"This video makes a fantastic gift to those have laughed at Hyacinth's life's hopes and the ""hoi pollois"" which always result at the end.  For those who are thinking of buying this video for their own video  library, as I have done, I must put a positive word or two for the high  bred quality from which video is from. Once you pop this video into your  VCR, the neighborhood will want to know why all that laughter is emanating  from your house.  This video is full of the best clips from the greatest  series ever aired, ""Keeping Up Appearances.""",947894400,6,548,4.42
