2828529,5,630298789X,Good movie.  Enjoyed a lot. Would recommend.,1441843200,,44,5.285714285714286
2828530,5,630298789X,"I still have the VHS version of this movie and waited a long time for it to show up on DVD.  When it did, I snapped it up right away. For anyone looking for a suspenseful drama aboard a vacationing couple's yacht in the South Pacific, this is it. After the couple rescue two survivors adrift on the ocean, all seems perfectly OK, until the behaviour of the two survivors reveals that their intentions and story are not what they seem.  It soon becomes evident that the vacation is no longer about a holiday, but about survival.

Great flick.",1330560000,5,541,4.444444444444445
2828531,5,630298789X,I have seen this movie when I was 15 years old back in 1995 and have recently purchased this flick last week on DVD and enjoy this movie like crazy. This movie features Kelly Rowan and Bruce Greenwood at their best acting. I personally felt they were the entire movie and without their finest performances as the deranged villains this movie would be a pure bore because I am not that crazy about Kate Jackson or Kenneth Welsh's acting in it. They didn't give a tremendous and impressive performance as Greenwood and Rowan did. I watch this flick a lot because I love Rowan and Greenwood and they made this movie a total thriller to watch! I recommend anyone who is a fan of psychotic flicks to see this and buy it because this is definitely the flick for you fans of deranged characters to see and own.,1210118400,6,803,4.4324324324324325

Great thriller...It went so fast...",1512777600,,54,5.875
8193555,1,630298789X,Really stupid writing despite some good actors and a possibly interesting storyline.,1508803200,,84,6.083333333333333
8193556,1,630298789X,"Cheesy 1990s bad script, bad acting, corny musical/sound score.  The opening scene should give you a good hint of what's in store.",1507852800,,130,4.909090909090909
8193557,3,630298789X,"This is a movie from the 90s. Some reviewers have complained that they were misled into thinking it is a current movie, however right beside the title it is printed 1993. It's production values are  typical of the era. It's quite well paced and the actor's were all very good. It is suspenseful and entertaining. I enjoyed it.",1506988800,2,326,4.620689655172414

8193559,1,630298789X,Lying amazon. Bait and switch. A stupid 1990s movie that lures us in with the promise of being a 2017 movie. Knock it off!,1506211200,,122,4.125
8193560,4,630298789X,"This is an excellent movie.  My only disgust is that Amazon chose to display it as a 2017 release when in fact it was made, and clearly so, in 1992.  Otherwise it would deserve 5 stars.  Truly great acting by the terrific cast and fine script and production make for a thrilling movie experience.",1505260800,2,296,4.444444444444445
8193561,1,630298789X,"Why does it say ""2017"" by the title?? Totally deceiving. Amazon video is full of false details or omissions that are supposed to take people to start watching things, like series releasing an episode whenever they feel like (not even every week!). What's the point! It's easier to turn on the TV!...
 In this case, most people watch new movies, not so much movies from 1992, like this movie.
One star probably unfair with the movie itself, but this is a ""review"" it doesn't say anywhere it should be just about strictly the movie and this things all over just make me mad and there's not another place to complain and be seen (which apparently is all they care about). I guess we have to get tricky like the childish people in charge of Amazon video and the need to compete with N...x and H..lu. Stop treating customers like we are stupid kids, please! And customers!: Amazon is not doing us any favors! They make tons of money from us. We can ask in exchange at least not to be lied to, can we?",1499472000,6,995,4.407608695652174
