There are 3 CD's with several movies on each.  The majority of them are great and the others are OK but the ones that are great makes it worth the money.  I don't like to swap CD's while I am working so this serves my purpose while entertaining me. Just have to push play between movies.",1358035200,2,324,4.126984126984127

4652733,2,B005CFC0MO,some of the movies were really old and silent. if I wanted those kind I would purchase the classics. Most were not even b movies. Sometimes I wonder what the stars are thinking when they accept these rolls. Unless they don't care what film their name is in. Honestly I would not bother with it. there are many better ones. UNLESS.. you like a big variety of films.,1376784000,9,364,4.367647058823529

8465241,3,B005CFC0MO,There's always a clunker in these movie packs.,1410307200,,46,4.875
8465242,3,B005CFC0MO,"The problem with this mystery pack is that these movies do not stand the test of time. This means that you are interested in reliving the oldies or you have an interest in studying older time periods. If you are an Alfred Hitchcock fan then you will enjoy this pack with 2 of his films. There is also a sprinkle of well known actors in some of their earliest films. So if you are a movie historian of sorts you now have another reason to get this pack. You will not find these movies in the Movie Guide because they are not well known. Or you need to be an mystery film junkie that is willing to try mystery movies that lack all  modern technology. The storylines cover a wide range of topics such as family secrets, murder mysteries, falsely accused, etc..  If the price is right and you want 15 hours that will take you back in time into old school mystery movies, then this is for you.",1408752000,,888,4.2485207100591715
8465243,3,B005CFC0MO,Great service on receiving the product.  You get a lot of movies that you don't want with this type of product.  But the price is very reasonable and there are several movies that make it worth it in the end.,1406419200,,208,4.175
