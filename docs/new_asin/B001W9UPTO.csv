Good story, again wished to have bought it on blu ray, actually didn't even bother looking for it due to more bad comments. Beats most American movies. A type of movie you can watch with family instead of worrying whether or not a nude scene or sex scene will pop up, not good if you have kids around.  All you see in American movies is sex and nudity nowadays. Believe me I have nothing against nudity and sex, but there are movies for that genre. This is a simple love story, which gets complicated as the movie progresses. Definitely recommend.",1433376000,,631,4.3931623931623935
