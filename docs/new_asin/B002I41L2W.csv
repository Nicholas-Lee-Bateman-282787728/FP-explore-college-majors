8370708,5,B002I41L2W,"Excellent content and instruction; Jeff McErlain is an awesome player, conversant in theory, and he's very enthusiastic about the material. It moves fairly quickly and the riffs are not broke down to their atomic structure. That may lose some new guitarists. Also, many of the riffs are in Box 2,3,4,and 5 of the minor pentatonic scale. If you are only riffing in Box 1, you may get lost. Finally, when he explains a critical juncture in a phrase, Mr McErlain generally refers to notes on the fretboard...he does not say ""7th fret on B string""...he'll say, ""then go to the F#"". Nothing wrong with that; every real player needs to known all the notes on the fingerboard cold...it just may frustrate a new guitarist. All in all, an excellent DVD any guitarist should have in their video library.

If you are new to the guitar I'd recommend Stauffer's ""Slow Blues Licks"" and Congilio's ""Texas Blues Licks""...they both have flashy fast riffs, but they are painstakingly broken down to kindergarten level.",1416528000,2,1000,4.882352941176471

8370711,3,B002I41L2W,"Potensial library of everything you need. It is probably too many different styles. If you as a guitarplayer base your playing of only this dvd, you will feel like being ""all over the place"". Supplements is requested.",1340409600,2,217,4.891891891891892
8370712,5,B002I41L2W,"Man if you like the blues, this is an awesome way to pick up some great new licks. Jeff McErlain can play the blues and can teach the blues. He's also got incredible tone. I picked this course up through [...], another great resource with loads of videos and courses. In addition to this gem Jeff McErlain also has available [on TrueFire] - ""50 Blues Rock Guitar Licks You Must Know"", ""Blues-Rock Evolution"" and ""Kings of Tone"". All of them are worth your while, Check them out... OK gotta get back to playing now.",1315180800,2,514,4.4787234042553195
8370713,4,B002I41L2W,"this dvd was a great supprize to me. The instructor had all the timing down properly to many great blues licks and turnarounds by Hendrix,Clapton,BB king and other great blues lick's and riff's you will recognize. His teaching manner is also good and easy to follow for a begginer or more advanced player.
well thought out and very usefull licks on this dvd ....along with a website backup called Truefire.com where you can discuss the dvd with other students on a Forum style chat board, and talk to instructors as well. Others in this series that are good as well are 50 Rock licks you must know.

Good Bang for the buck here.
