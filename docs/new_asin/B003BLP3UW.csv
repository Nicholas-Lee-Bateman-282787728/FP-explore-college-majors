8393744,1,B003BLP3UW,"This DVD was produced but never authorized to go on sale! The producer, Mr. Ferrari put this unfinished DVD on the market without asking permission of the group nor the subjects that participated. Hence it is no longer for sale! I am one of those people in this production, it was not supposed to be like this. There is no music score, there is no defining moments and no explanations what so ever, this was a horrible post editing job. None of the GS crew had any input! As I said, this was not supposed to go on any store shelf! The crew Investigating did what they do, investigate. There is plenty from that particular Investigation that should have been included in the DVD and were not! That is post production Problems, that group does very well when investigating!",1300492800,2,771,4.553956834532374
8393745,2,B003BLP3UW,"Producer and Director Rob Ferrari brings to us the exploits of the Garden State Ghost Hunters, a real New Jersey based Paranormal Investigation group ( [...] ). The investigation takes place in the Bolton Mansion, a historic house in Levittown Pennsylvania. There is no doubt that the house has withstood the test of time but little is revealed to the audience about the 150 year plus history, facts nor fiction. Yet here we are, following the GSGH team members; Boni Bates (Team Founder), Robert Reid, Dave Goldstein, and a handful of others through this house. There are some moments where Thermal Imaging suggests a ""footprint"" in an unlikely place. There is only conjecture tossed about with no scientific conclusions. The Reality style suggests no script and from the flat performances I am a true believer that the ""Team"" is authentic. Perhaps in this case, Mr Ferrari showed up on the wrong night because this ""Reality"" just is not that interesting. This film falls short in a few ways. No beginning, no middle, no end. It does not evoke even the slightest element of drama and I assure you your pulse will falter during the paltry 18 minutes. The ""Bonus"" material on the DVD is nothing more than shameless self-promotion by the Producer/Director Rob Ferrari. Shot as a talking head, he responds to screen prompts about his company, what type of productions he has done and the kind of camera he uses. There are no Behind the Scene clips from the production at all. The cover art is very dark. It is so black and gray that it might be unreadable unless viewed in bright sunlight. Overall the people are real, but Mr. Ferrari's Truth is hard to take.",1286755200,3,1656,4.753472222222222
