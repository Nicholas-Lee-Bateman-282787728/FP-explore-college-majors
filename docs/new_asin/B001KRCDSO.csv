8316042,3,B001KRCDSO,"The Color of Money is not recorded in widescreen, so I was disappointed with the purchase.

Cocktail was recorded in widescreen and was great to watch.

No DVDs should be sold if they are not in the widescreen mode without warning the purchaser!
Most people now have flatscreens in their homes!.",1398297600,3,295,4.764705882352941

8316044,5,B001KRCDSO,"I purchased this primarily for ""The Color of Money"" but Cocktail is an OK movie, too.  I had forgotten that Paul Newman, RIP, had received an Oscar for this as best actor.  Although I'm only a tepid fan of Tom Cruise, the trio of Paul, Tom and Maria Mastriantonio works so very well here, and MM is a lovely actress.  I enjoy all her work.",1391040000,,339,4.184615384615385
8316045,5,B001KRCDSO,"I Love the color of money. Seeing Paul Newman reprise his roll of Fast Eddie Felson made for a really good film, and then to also get cocktail with it really made this a good deal.",1385942400,,180,4.027777777777778
