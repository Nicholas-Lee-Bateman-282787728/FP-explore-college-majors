Also, using mainly non-cartoon pictures of animals and using both upper and lower case letters adds to the educational content.  The voice is clear and quieting. It is original and  different from large company productions; maybe that's why it really holds the kids' attention.",1116892800,,344,5.125
8196413,5,B00021H1D6,"To be honest, I was bugged as well by the use of a panda to stand for ""n"" as well as a duck to stand for ""u"" (the ox used for ""x"" I could understand...).  So I went ahead and contacted the company and asked why they used those animals instead of other animals that started with the respective ""n"" and ""u"" letters.  I was told that since this was a small company with limited resources, they had bought the animal images for use in the video and those images were also limited in their range/assortment.  So they had to make due and become creative in their thinking with their portrayal of the animal alphabet.  Okay, I give them credit for trying.  And really any video should not be used without parental guidance and participation, so as an activity I do review other animals associated with their respective first letters with my children.  On another note, my daughter, who started watching this video when she was 2, loves the associations and wants to go over the abc's  ALL THE TIME!  She has alphabet letters that she plays with in the tub and she'll pick up a letter and say, for example: ""c"" is for chicken, or even ""e"" is for elephant (as in the video).  It's very cute plus more importantly I know she's having wholesome images ingrained in her.  Even my 6 month-old son loves to watch this video, and really I think the recommended viewing age should be lowered from 1 year+ to 6 months on up.  All in all, this video is not something I'd be embarrassed to show around anyone - the bold-lined pictures and the fact that they show both upper and lower case letters is a plus!  And really it instills such confidence in my daughter exemplified by her repetition of the letters, so I'd recommend investing in this video to anyone.",1111622400,2,1741,4.440251572327044
8196414,1,B00021H1D6,"I purchased this dvd based on the 2 people who gave it 5 stars, my 4 year old still struggles with her abc's and I thought this would be great in helping her identify which words start with what letter, she loves animals which was an added bonus, I was listening to it in the background when I heard N is for Panda, U is for Duck and X is for Ox, now I know that these words have those letters in them but it sent my 4 year old the wrong signal, when asked what starts with the letter N she responds Panda,  my 7 and 9 year old were trying to guess what animals matched the letter and even they were shocked and said how can a child possibly learn from this DVD, there has to be a better DVD out there to teach your child their alphabet, one where the letters at least match the word.

Not wrtiting this to be mean, just a very honest person, hope I helped.",1110412800,,857,3.947976878612717
8196415,5,B00021H1D6,My 1 year old and 3 year old loved it.  Once you put the DVD on you know you have at least 27 minutes to do what you have to without worrying about what the kids are watching.  They will be entertained and learning at the same time.  Great way to learn their ABCs and animals.  I highly recommend it!,1087430400,2,300,3.95
8196416,5,B00021H1D6,"This is an absolutely terrific video for young children. It says for ages 1+, but I've found that some children younger and lots of children older like it as well! The animals are great, as are the sounds for each one. The narrator has a pleasant voice and is quite soothing. Overall, this is a great educational video for kids and you don't have to be afraid to leave them alone with it!",1084233600,3,388,4.328767123287672
