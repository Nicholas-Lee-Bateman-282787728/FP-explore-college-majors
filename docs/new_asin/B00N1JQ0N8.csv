6605746,5,B00N1JQ0N8,"This movie will be compared to others, especially robot films, but it stands on it's own. Great acting, filmed well. The robots are believable. It's simple and complicated at the same time. It's hope and despair all rolled up into one story. In the end, it's humans killing humans, you might as well give it to the robots anyway. They might do a better job.",1413072000,3,357,4.507692307692308
6605747,4,B00N1JQ0N8,"The film opens by letting us know it is 2044. Solar activity has reduced the human population to 21 million people. They live in walled in cities to protect themselves from the encroaching desert and radiation. Robots, that look like crash test dummies, have assumed many human duties. They have 2 protocols. The first is never to harm a human. The second is that they can not alter another robot. Shades of ""I Robot.""

It appears the robots are made from recycled parts. People in the dump outside the city are fair game to be shot. Society appears to be two tiered. There doesn't appear to be much of a government, but there is a police force. Insurance still exists and Jack Vaucan (Antonio Banderas) is an insurance agent/adjustor/ investigator. Communications is sporadic and there are nude holograms dancing around the city, something that was never explained. The cities are dying, i.e. they have ""expiration dates.""

As in ""I, Robot"" the protocols are broken as robots are discovered repairing themselves and stealing items. Jack with a pregnant wife (Birgitte Hjort Srensen) is investigating what the insurance company and manufacturers say is impossible. He soon finds out from Melanie Griffith that the ""monkey has come down from the tree.""

The film starts out as an interesting science fiction mystery/thriller. We struggle with Jack to discover what is going on. However once we discover what is actually happening, the film fails to create that initial interest and you wait for it to pick up. It ends rather odd on a down note. Okay for me-too science fiction. 3 1/2 stars

Parental Guidance: F-bomb. No sex. Background hologram nudity.",1413072000,26,1652,4.97463768115942

6605749,5,B00N1JQ0N8,"This film is informed by many SF sources but at least they made a decent film instead of buying the name of the book (like I,Robot - which this has incorporated parts from-the book, not the film) and making a piece of drek they have tried to put together the story of what happens as one sentient species gives way to another.

The film also does NOT rip off Blade Runner, but does tap the original Dick novel (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) for inspiration.

If you like your SF films more on the thinking side (Blade Runner, Children of Men, Code 46,The Final Cut, Gattaca, etc)  then I would recommend this film to you.",1412985600,121,628,4.396551724137931

6605753,3,B00N1JQ0N8,"It seems like every year a new movie gets made about robots becoming sentient and trying to break free of human control, or trying to understand the human condition,  Automata is both. It's a visually impressive film bolstered by a great performance from Antonio Banderas. It has a fairly straightforward Story(both fascinating and wholly unoriginal) about robots breaking free of human domination and trekking across the irradiated desert land that now covers the earth to seek a new haven to call their own. Antonio Banderas's character(Jacq Vaucan) works as an insurance agent for a robotics company, who hates his job / his existence. With a wife and his soon to be born child on the way, all he wants to do is escape from it all to some place better(much like the robots). One day he gets called in to inspect a robot that was terminated after having been seen repairing itself, something these robots are not supposed to do, in fact, are forbidden to do by their 2 laws safe programming. Evidence collected from this robot exposes other robots that might also be operating beyond their programming. The big wigs at the top of the robotics company find out about this and act quickly to try and destroy the robots and anyone who knows about them. After a nearly fatal car chase and subsequent crash, Jacq Vaucan finds himself on the run with 4 other robots.......and then we precede to have a whole bunch of overused symbolism and Sci-Fi cliches thrown at us. You see, Jacq Vaucan and the robots destinies parallel one another, his wife gives birth to their child, the robots create a new robotic life form, and nearly every robot movie trope you've ever seen is used to glaring effect. In the end, due to some bad acting from melanie griffith and a script in need of further refinement, it didn't turn out a good as i hoped, but it's not a bad film, i enjoyed it for what i tried to do, and i expect it will to some extent satisfy those of you who are into Sci-Fi films like this, but for the most part, Automata's story borrows too freely the ideas of many other better Sci-Fi films to be anything more than what you've seen a hundred times before.",1412899200,50,2155,4.582901554404145

""Your time is coming to an end.""  - ""Automata"" movie poster, partial tag line

Four ENIGMATIC Stars. Automata is a deliberately-paced, entertaining dystopian SciFi movie that is somewhat Blade Runner-esque in overall ambiance, but it has a big plot divergence that separates it from the Ridley Scott classic movie. The opening scenes depict, visually and in writing, that it is 2044 AD and the Earth is baked by the sun and the population is greatly reduced. ROC Corp created the automata pilgrim robot program to help mankind and Jacq Vaucan, the insurance inspector (Antonio Banderas), is running down some unusual claims when things go awry. The last third of the movie really picks up and has a well-done conclusion that helps make the overall movie experience worthwhile. Starring Banderas, Dylan McDermott, Melanie Griffith in two roles, Birgitte HJort Srensen and Robert Forster, with Christa Campbell, Tim McInnerny, David Ryall, Andy Nyman, David Realm, Geraldine Somerville and Javier Bardem. Directed by Gabe Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez. Very Definitely Recommended. Four DYSTOPIAN Stars. (Millennium Films. Greenmoon Productions. Rated R. Color. HD. CC.

6605827,4,B00N1JQ0N8,"I understand why many may find the movie unlovable, but I like it because of Bandera's acting and the overall minimalism of the production.
It titters on the verge of nihilism, then, unfortunately as so happens with most popular titles, gives humans another chance to go forward.
Nothing hi-tech about the scenes, only a depressing outlook of the future and a meditation on what life could be or should be and if humans are anything but carrier of consciousness. Each scene gives the audience chance to ask simple pieces of questions.
Watching the movie was not a movie experience, rather it was feeling like reading a non-fiction.

It poses questions that are not often asked; such as, what would you feel, really feel, if you met an artificial intelligence, that you could sense/intuit that it was ""intelligent"", and that it was not under any human control of any kind.  Would you feel scared?  Well ... would you?  Or ... what?  And another question; is it possible for artificial intelligence to ""just evolve"", as the human race has evolved.

After I had seen Automata I read a couple of reviews by famous, intellectual, professional film reviewers that were so disparaging.  So, I am glad I watched the film first.",1492387200,3,735,4.950819672131147

6605935,2,B00N1JQ0N8,"Where this film wins is the concepts it employs in the narrative: That is, robots evolving at an extremely accelerated rate and thus paving the way for human extinction and their eventual take over. This film does not turn into a cheesy, predicable robot uprising like others of it's genre, which I was very happy about. It must be noted however, that the film itself is dull. What's interesting is that the only characters I found interesting were the robots. All the human characters are extremely lifeless and feel like if you swapped their heads no one would take notice. The protagonist is meh. You spend the film waiting for him to hit his high point and it just never comes. He has little screen presence. He's emotionally flat throughout the entire film, and the addition of a pregnant wife felt like nothing more than a pointless afterthought. The dystopian future is one you've seen a million times before, not only that, but it feels depressing just for the sake of it, not any real reason. The scene to scene writing is bad and I appreciate the actors for trying to do their best with it. The film makes little to no effort for artistic direction either, the cinematography is textbook-ish and some of the music feels very out of place.

But I like robots, so 2/5.",1458172800,2,1276,4.621145374449339

But we have robots with something approaching AI to do our dirty work for us.  Fortunately, they are hedged by two ""principles"" - don't allow any harm to come to any living thing and don't self-repair.  Once robots start to self-repair, then, presumably, evolution might kick in and it would be curtains for what remains of humanity.

Antonio Banderas is an insurance investigator for the company that makes the robots.  He knows his game, but he wants to take his pregnant wife, leave the city and go to the ocean. Then, a very scruffy Dylan McDermott discovers a robot self-repairing and seeming to be ....alive.  Banderas is sent off by this to find the mysterious ""watchmaker"" who may be trying to knock humanity down a notch as the leading edge of evolution.

This movie has nice visuals, a seedy city and an arid wasteland. The actors are good.  The plot moves along, with its subtext of ""what is alive?"" and ""would it really be so bad if a better version of humanity took over?""  In some ways, I was attracted by the robots who seemed to be channeling Ghandi in their passive disobedience/obedience to the first principle; the humans, on the other hand, seemed pretty loathsome. Also, some scenes made me wonder whether the robots weren't about to create their own religious/ethical system  If this were a novella, I would expect a sequel set in a post-human world.

Since it is not a slam-bang, explosion-filled chase adventure, it probably will seem slow to some viewers.  There are some moments of excitement and action, but not many. Also, some things are left relatively unexplained; I understand the cockroach robot is a self-replicating robot, but is it the next generation? the robot protectors? their pets?

6606176,3,B00N1JQ0N8,"In the not-so-distant future, following a global catastrophe that's cut the world's population by 99%, most of humanity's work is carried out by mechanized androids. Of course, in typically human fashion, despite such grave losses and automated manual labor there's still a need for insurance adjusters. Antonio Banderas plays one such stiff, an expectant father who stumbles upon the flicker of life behind one of those robotic worker bees and slips into a deep rabbit hole. It's a world with a lot of promise, particularly well fleshed-out and alive. In the same vein as Blade Runner, from which it borrows liberally, the city seems to live, breathe and carry on under its own power, independent of the story at hand. Excellent production design, memorable sets and striking character models make this world an easy one to occupy. Too bad, then, that so much of the story is bland, predictable retread. Some classic sci-fi seeds are planted in the early going, but by the climax they've been cast aside in favor of a simple good-vs-evil chase and a blunt, obvious lesson or two in morality. Banderas is crude and heavy-handed in the lead role, particularly when he's asked to hold the rudder by his lonesome for a stretch in the second act, and the film really needs far more than that from the character. An ambitious swing, but ultimately a thin, unremarkable result.",1433808000,,1371,4.913793103448276

6606180,4,B00N1JQ0N8,"Trying hard to avoid spoilers here...
This movie didn't dazzle me, but I have seen some dumb science fiction movies lately, and this isn't one of those either.  It depicts a rather bleak and - let's be honest - potentially realistic view of the future.  But it talks about high radioactivity levels in some areas but doesn't explain how they came about exactly. Nuclear war, environmental problems? And we learn very little about whether the rest of the world is in the same shape as the city where the first half of the movie takes place. Given the ending, hinted at in places early on, perhaps we are intentionally kept in the dark, which is in a way a bit of cheating on the writers' part. However, ultimately I enjoyed the movie without knowing all the details of how the city (and the planet?) got the way it did, but revealing more may have made the film better.

I was reminded of Isaac Asimov's robot stories when it talked about the robots being designed first and foremost not to harm humans, and I liked how they made the real danger sign be when the units repair themselves.  The explanation of why it was (supposedly) impossible for a human to figure out how to give the robots thinking capability is rather neat, and I won't give it away here.

The plot is fairly straightforward for a thriller. By that I mean that I didn't feel like they produced elaborate, shocking (and to me, often unbelievable) plot twists to keep us on our toes. I mean, isn't that required of thrillers do?  I didn't miss those twists, but I think sometimes movie audiences feel they need them.  But this movie just tells its story and doesn't try to shock too much along the way.  In doing so, I feel like it gives us time to think about the issues brought up, especially when you consider the real efforts out there to create thinking machines.

I like the main character - which is good as we see an awful lot of him - and the process he goes through to see the robots a bit differently is slow and realistic. My only complaint, and it is a mild one, is that I knew early on where the movie would end up.  Now I write novels and perhaps the act of planning and writing books helps me guess where plots are ultimately heading, or perhaps the screenplay is designed to help us see it coming. It is a rather vague ending, perhaps again to make us think or - surely not to set up a sequel!",1433289600,,2377,4.357466063348416

6606195,5,B00N1JQ0N8,"Many have criticized the acting for being flat, but that is, in my opinion, just a failure to recognize the collective mood that the filmmaker intentionally creates within the society of humans in the film. The director is getting the actors to be a bit droopy and flat, as befits their lot in a nihilistic world where humans can barely survive, and are stuck in small, cramped, degraded habitats. Every single human character is a defeated person, leading a dreary life, perhaps in denial about the fact they are just barely eking out an existence.  As self-determination sprouts in their robots, the humans are just methodically putting one foot in front of the other.  In other words, the humans are becoming more like robots just as the robots are becoming more like humans.  Once you grasp this, you can see that the acting is just as it should be.

For not having cashed out the full philosophical potential of the themes that are raised (one thirsts at the end for an extended Director's Cut), this film merits maybe four-and-a-half stars, which I am rounding up to 5 in order to help compensate for all the unjustly harsh reviews here.",1432857600,2,1143,4.728643216080402

6606199,3,B00N1JQ0N8,"I had high hopes for this movie, but was sadly let down. It has the makings for a thought provoking story of the birth and continuation of A.I. life forms, and humans fear and bigotry of such a new race of life. But sadly glosses over a lot of the finer details that could've given the movie more 'umph'. It either tries too hard to be like Blade Runner, or I, Robot. It does give some insight into the birth and restraint of A.I. and the insurance company that ensures reliability, and investigates defects. But if this was a movie about railroads and derailments, I don't think the viewer would appreciate Antonio standing on the tracks in front of a high speed train to prove they don't hurt anyone. And this is where the movie goes downhill, at least for me. Some interesting aspects, and considerations for an A.I. race to develop in a non humanoid form and language. But in the end, it's the usual stand off, shoot out, literal cliff hanger. And the possibility of a sequel ala Mad Max. Or if Antonio can't make it for that one, it can easily be explained from this as well.",1432425600,,1080,4.405

For starters - I think Antonio Banderas is solid in most every performance he gives.  So the movie starts with a leg up by having him cast as the lead...Yes - his presence included a mercifully brief appearance of his wife looking beyond strange...I dealt with it.

The film's plot is a lot of rehash - but there are some fresh-ish ideas in here.  I wonder how many movies would exist if BLADE RUNNER had never existed?  Ridley Scott should get a piece of every movie that uses his.  Seriously.

Anyhoo - the film moves at a good clip.  I was never bored.  It wasn't totally predictable.  The special effects were solid.  The film is well shot - has a style to it.  There is genuine emotion and there are stakes in the story.  It's not an empty action film.  There's a moral to the story.  Overall - a solid B - maybe a B+ movie.  At the very least - I think you get your money's worth and you feel as if you actually watched a film that had thought and effort put into it.",1431388800,,1094,4.061032863849765

In 2044, solar storms have killed 99.7 % of the population of the world and only 21 million-people survive. The ROC Corporation has designed and built robots called Automata Pilgrim 7000 to help to rebuild the world. These robots have two security protocols and they can neither harm humans nor altering itself or other robot. When police officer Sean Wallace shots a robot and claims that it was altering itself, insurance agent of ROC Jacq Vaucan is in charge of the investigation. Soon he believes that there is a ""clocksmith"" illegally modifying the robots but What he discovers will have profound consequences for the future of humanity.

I found this to be a very exciting movie with a great tone to it, it has a blade runner style to it crossed with numerous other movies, but still holds its own as a great looking and interesting sci-fi, the effects are not notch, I love these cool looking robots, great designs on everything you see throughout to create this future world, great cast all round, Antonio Banderas was a cool lead, this is rather a gem in my opinion and is really worth checking out if you love a great sci-fi that's original and has a great visual flare and a good story!!",1430611200,,1206,4.661971830985915

I do not know why it was not shown in American theaters! just baffles me; however, this movie is not action packed rather more on the drama side and is philosophical for sure. IMHO, this may be the best SyFy movie in a long time. This movie respects the viewers brain, raises serious questions about the possibility of autonomous robots evolving to become independent capable of violating the rules they were made to obey, and the possible consequences arising from that.

As an artificial intelligence engineer myself; the questions raised are valid and the possibility is not far fetched. One question that was never asked explicitly but was vividly clear: What is life?.. what constitutes life? Definitely, highly recommended if you are into SyFy or a futurist thinker.

On the acting side, Antonio Banderas is a grade AA super star. Incredibly well acted and well done to the point, I personally never had a moment of doubt about the legitimacy of an event while watching this movie. Just amazing!

Whether it was the writers or the director I can't quite tell, but the direction of the film doesn't really grab you.  The acting is fair at best, Banderas just stares and ponders most of the time and doesn't really seem to show any emotion.  Perhaps that's the problem, you don't feel any emotion.  The only one that does is the villain Dylan McDermott who plays a cop over the edge.  This is just a time filling escapism sci fi watch.

There is some great symbolism in the form of innocence and naivety with a creator and creation twist but I'm split on if it was there on purpose or not. Banderas is a great actor so Im leaning towards subtext.

The story is about struggling against the end of everything and eventually letting what dreams may, come.
I only drop one star because I know that this is likely more anti-human propaganda from the humanists -Or- if you are into the whole New World Order thing this is a treatise on the Singularity.

6606380,5,B00N1JQ0N8,"I've been a hard core science fiction film fanatic over 50 years, and this movie is, well, beautiful. There's plenty of violence in it if that's what you're in the mood for, and some good automatons to boot. The violence part might get on some people's nerves, but sometimes you just gotta see the T-1000 stab people in the head and cause general violent chaos, and the Terminator blow the T-1000's head in two. That's natural.

I call Automata beautiful because of its--I don't know how to put--its upward trajectory, away from a dystopia, not mired in one like 1984. The machines and people in Automata come from a dystopian world, but it's refreshing to see the wonderful directions the movie points toward.

6606423,3,B00N1JQ0N8,"Is it just me, or is there a sudden surge of movies again, on the theme of Artificial Intelligence?
When one of them has Antonio Banderas as a leading character I have to have a look at it.
I don't want to give away much of the plot, and anyhow you can read the basics in any review.

In this movie, Banderas almost seems like the principle supporting actor (which would make his
wife third, or second-supporting).  The real interest is actually in the robots themselves.  I shall
call them robots since, despite usually humanoid features, they would in no way pass for humans
like the androids of the Terminator series or Battlestar Galactica, for example.

In that emphasis on the AI itself, rather than on mankind, it follows the lead from a film long ago, but
not from a universe far far away: Artificial Intelligence, first a short story, then a film idea by Stanley
Kubrick, finally brought to existence by Steven Spielberg in 2001.  And like A.I., this whole film has
a future-nostalgic feel to it, about a humanity in gradual decline, not at war with its creations so
much as gradually being replaced by them.  Of the two I preferred A.I., but if you are a Banderas fan, well,
then you won't want to miss this one anyhow.",1425859200,2,1229,4.538461538461538

6606436,4,B00N1JQ0N8,"A slow-paced, thoughtful film but also another very gloomy doomsday prediction for the human race. There may not be much action, though there are some very violent scenes, shocking in their suddenness.

In a future dystopia (is there any other kind?) an insurance investigator is assigned to determine whether an android ""killed"" by another agent has actually achieved self-concept when the agent says he destroyed it because it was repairing itself and hiding the fact. The investigator wants to use this assignment to get a transfer from the city to the coast, believing the ocean will be some sort of cure for all his problems. When he consults with a roboticist who is murdered during their interview, he finds himself on the run with three androids who are heading for a supposed Paradise where humans can't exist as they are pursued by other agents wanting nothing more than to cover up the entire mess. The agents also bring along the investigator's wife and newborn daughter  as bait.

Along the way, the investigator comes to see the mechanical creatures as more human and to realize they will carry on where Man failed.  There are philosophical discussions--how can there be death when there hasn't yet been life?  No one species can survive forever, etc. This last is spoken as cockroaches crawl across the desert they infest, plainly pointing out that they HAVE survived for billions of years and will probably survive for billions more while others have come and gone.

The rare futuristic innovations shown such as commercial holograms floating over the city, a sexbot, etc., are interesting but most of the landscape is dreary and definitely unappealing. Dirt and filth seems to be the catchword in most of these films.

There are intercut flashes of a young boy playing in the surf with a pet turtle, but whether this is a symbol of the detective's wish for peace and a normalcy no longer existing, a look into the future at another yet-to-be-born child, or merely some dream never to be realized, is never made clear.  The ending...on a question mark...leaves it all up in the air, apparently for the viewer to interpret as he will.",1425513600,,2149,4.884615384615385

6606478,4,B00N1JQ0N8,"Androids have become more and more prominent in Sci-Fi films. And with better budgets and better writing I doubt we've seen the end of them.

Here's the scoop. The sun has thrown off some intense flares rendering the Earth nearly uninhabitable. Androids are engineered and manufactured to both help and save mankind. Jacq Vaucan (Antonio Banderas) is an insurance adjuster for the manufacturer who steps in when any droid happens to be the cause of financial loss. While on one particular case evidence arises that suggests that someone, or maybe the droids themselves are being altered to take away protocol #2 which inhibits their thinking to insure they don't get too smart. Vaucan is determined to see if this is true.

There is so much to like about this movie but it just falls a bit short. It needed a sharper story and dialogue. Plus, it seemed maybe too derivative. It's ""Blade Runner"" meets ""I Robot"" meets... And some of the core concerns 'what defines human' have been covered better in other movies. It does has a good look though. The washed out desert scenes really give the viewer a sense of how screwed up the environment has become. Some Sci-Fi films have a too controlled look and feel. This appears more natural, more real, and the camera often ends up in some odd places while framing a shot which I liked.

Somehow I never took Antonio Banderas seriously. His looks were always played up too much and he too often appeared in mediocre, big budget, Hollywood flicks. This is by far the best thing I've seen him in. No glamor or daring do. He's an insurance man in a situation way over his head and needs the droids to help him stay alive. Robert Forster is pretty good as the boss and the droids all do a sweet job, particularly Cleo. You get to know them to enough a degree that seeing any one of them get ""killed"" does manage to pack a punch.

With a reported $7,000,000 budget this gave me the sense of being a sincere effort. The droids were designed and effected well. They must have comprised a decent sized portion of the budget but it helped make the effort more believable. This might not be quite worth the  4 stars I gave it but it was certainly better than just 3. As frustrating as its shortcomings might be, it's still worth the time for fans of the genre.",1424822400,,2291,4.5375302663438255

6606480,1,B00N1JQ0N8,"This is not a take off on I Robot or Bladerunner because it is so ABYSMALLY  MIND-SUCKINGLY HORRIBLE that I refuse to compare it to either film.  OMG where to start.  Crushing fail on editing, acting, writing, directing, production, and inclusion of things that don't belong on camera (coke cans etc-come on!!!! with photoshop and CGI you could take 5 minutes and remove the stuff that doesn't belong if you have any pride in your work).  Other inconsistencies like AB out in the desert with robots trapped yet a car drives to them in 5 minutes??? WTH??!  Over-acted, hideously scripted, nonsensical crap.  The robots walk around mewling like little bitches and a lot of emphasis placed on sex-bots (PALEEZ).  BR and IR didn't need to rely on such cheesy cheap premises to drum up any interest.

And what happened to Melanie Griffin?!?!?  Did she use Mickey Rourke's plastic surgeon??  She looks eerily and stomach lurchingly like Mickey in this film.  Her neck and jowl skin is stretched so tight that longitudinal wrinkles look like tight saran wrap at jaw line.  It's just awful.  I didn't even recognize her at first and had to look at the credits to confirm it was her.  Her acting was just as bad as her husband's if not worse.  OMG I even rewound when she was shot a few times to see her die again.

Antonio killed every small ounce of respect I might have had for him with this offering.  Awful, boring, stupid, poorly written, disjointed, infantile, and many more adjectives I could list for days.  To compare this to Blade Runner is an insult to BR and every person that had any part of making it.  I couldn't get past half way without turning it off lest it suck my mind and soul from my body.

The atmosphere, props, and robots are excellent.  I agree that the rainy, ruined city scenes and imagery are sort of Blade Runner-esque, but the robots and the plot aren't the same. Of course, whenever you're dealing with AI and the ethics surrounding it, you'll recognize some similar story lines (humans are usually brutal A-holes, in a nutshell)- but I think Automata had an original take on this theme.  Banderas did a decent job with what he had to work with- the dialogue could have been better, however- but it was only awkward in a couple of scenes.

6606596,3,B00N1JQ0N8,"This is a film that will work for a very specific audience, and is very definitely NOT for everybody. While it is a strong movie in terms of the intelligent plot, the great acting, and strong message, I think it will not appeal to a large amount of its audience. It's just SO depressing.

First, it's shot in a kind of burned-out sepia tint, numbing everything in an almost monochromatic and dreary environment of futuristic dread. Imagine an arid, waterless&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner/dp/B000SW4DLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner</a>, an environment full of dread. Solar flares have wiped out most of the planet's life right down to the vegetation which amounts to scrub bush at best. Most of the planet has been reduced to a No Travel zone, life outside the city is very hard indeed.

Those humans who remain have invented a mass-produced robotic being they have called `Pilgrims' who are programmed with two basic underlying protocols (a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Robot/dp/B000I9YX06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Robot</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robocop/dp/B00IK590UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robocop</a>]): 1) They cannot harm any form of life, and 2) They can not alter themselves, or other robots.

Enter Antonio Banderas as Jacq Vaucan (more on this name coming up), who looks just terrible in almost every frame of this film. And for good reason: he's not well psychologically and, soon, physically. His pregnant wife (played by Birgitte Hjort Sorensen) pleads with him to come out of his funk and be a partner to her. Yet he is burned out at his job - he's an insurance inspector who specializes in defective robots. Worse yet, he has just discovered that some robots have apparently violated the second protocol (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jurassic-Park/dp/B00C1BV9Z6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jurassic Park</a>) but here they are actually modifying THEMSELVES physically and mentally. His superiors do not believe this is possible and turn on him, and he soon pleads with his boss let him retire or at least move into another field. Yet he knows too much, and his employers have decide that he must indeed depart, but unfortunately they dispatch hired assassins to do so.

As I've said, while this is a very intelligent movie, it moves very slowly, and often Banderas' speech is extremely  difficult to understand (I eventually turned on captioning). So yes, the story is well acted, and the CGI representation of the robots is top-notch (in this regard think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/District-9/dp/B0030GJ50C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">District 9</a>), but ultimately the movie is just SO slow-moving, and depressing that it's hard to stay involved.

Those who make it through the movie, however, will be rewarded: there is a message here, and it took me a little while to catch on to certain message-related symbols - here's one clue that is NOT A SPOILER: there is a single odd moment late in the film when one of Banderas' doomed fellow employees lifts his feet and discovers the desolated environment does seem to be teeming with insects. (As I said, it is NOT A SPOILER, but it just might help your understanding at the film's end).

As I said, though there is a story, and a message, here, I just found Jacq's ""journey"" to be so depressing that I found it difficult to latch on to its arguably uplifting message at the end. In fact, as evidence by all of the films I have linked to this review, the movie is extremely derivative and there are several heavily cliched approaches at work here. Like so many films of this genre for instance, there is that same old message that reappears: mankind is a distrusting, murderous being who sees that which is alien to him to be frightening and threatening and must be destroyed. There will be some, I'm sure, who might find AUTOMATA to be a meaningful movie, and will give this a higher rating than I did (at the time of this review the votes were almost uniformly spread out: 1/5 gave it a 1, another fifth gave it a 2, another 5th gave it a 3, and so on).

An additional note of interest: JACQUES de VAUCANSON was real person, a French inventor who, in the mid 1700s worked on various (yes) automata - as did several other inventors. Yet Vaucanson's fame came about because he invented the first automated Digestive Duck, a mechanical duck that could be fed grain, which it would supposedly digest and eventually excrete. Though it was actually a fraud (the excrement came from a separate section of the duck, and was not tied in to the food that was eaten), his work caught the interest of several high-ranking members of the royalty, and he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. When one of his proposals sought to replace weavers in the textile industry, he was pelted with stones as he walked in the street. It's certainly something to think about.",1422662400,,5119,5.39

6606598,5,B00N1JQ0N8,"Spoiler Alert!
If you look through the star rankings for this movie you will see a very odd spread. There are a lot of one star reviews and also quite a few five star reviews. While I will give you that some of the acting was not the best, the movie as a whole has something very special going for it. It is the only movie I can think of that posits the extinction of the human species. No redemption like in Blade Runner where colonies get shipped off to habitable planets, fade out dreaming of the ocean. I guess The Road is more bleak because you know the boy is probably  going to die but it still gives you hope. This movie on the other hand makes you consider the question what is transferred to the robots beside the atomic battery.
  The main characters in this movie are the robots not Antonio and the humans. I truly felt sorry for them. These are not your terminator indestructible kill-bots. They are very fragile easily damaged and more kind than than the humans( check out the graffiti faces painted on and the blood dripping from the robots hand when he catches the knife). The robots are tagged as losers because they haven't been able to stop the ecological disaster but the humans are really the species that can't survive and hate the robots for it.
  There is really a lot of good stuff in this movie, but you need to shift your perspective to get it. The robots are not ""human like"" in external form, even the sex bot is not attractive, why? Because it helps underline that something not ""like us"" but still sentient is all that is left. The actors keep repeating that ""life will find a way"" and then look at their babies, but their babies do not have a future in this environment,and that is very sad, and ""life"" is not the right word for the robots. They are not alive but they are conscious self reproducing beings. In Blade Runner the robots were pretty and handsome but doomed, in this it is flipped.",1422576000,3,1926,4.383753501400561

Even the Planet of the Apes series kind of relates -not to label animal intelligence as artificial by any means.

6606613,3,B00N1JQ0N8,"Automata(released Sept/14)stars,among others,Antonio Banderas,Birgitte Hjort Srensen,Dylan McDermott,Robert Forster,Tim McInnerny and Melanie Griffith. This is a film which is compelling for about the first half,but falls into a pit of monotony thereafter.
The story finds Banderas as an insurance agent in 2044. It is a post apocalyptic Earth which has had the majority of its population decimated. Rain is harmful and they have artificial clouds to counteract the effects. Cities are walled and those that cannot survive in the cities find refuge outside the walls. Robots have been made to alleviate mankind's most mundane tasks. The protocols built into each one say they cannot harm a human nor can they alter themselves in any way.
The inevitable cracks start to appear. First Banderas is called to a family whose dog,it is alleged,has killed their pet dog. If true his company has to pay up. Then comes the case of a cop who has shot and killed a derelict robot because it was thought it was repairing itself. Banderas attends an""autopsy"" to find out that the robot had indeed been greatly altered,probably by a so called""clocksmith"",which he wants to locate. Banderas's boss puts the pressure on him to get rid of the problem,but the problem just gets worse the more he probes.
He meets a doctor who specializes in robotics. She inserts the intelligent ""kernal"" from the shot robot into one of her own,one called""Cleo"".She starts repairing herself,which is outside the robots second protocol. This leads Banderas to go outside the city walls in search of an answer. He finds a robot by itself inside a shipping container. When challenged it lights itself on fire. Back in the doctors lab later,the doctor is assassinated by two young kids. Banderas flees for his life and hitches a ride in a car driven by Cleo. They ride far outside the city but they get into an accident during the chase. Banderas and Cleo survive,but he is hurt. Daylight comes and the desert sun is getting hotter by the minute. Soon Cleo and he are joined by four other robots who come to their aid. They start taking Banderas not to the city but out farther into the desert. He resists, but in his weakened state he cannot fight them and is forced to play along.
Back in the city Banderas's boss is called on the carpet by HIS bosses. The secret is revealed that once upon a time a singular robot was built with seemingly unlimited intelligence. They realized the threat it could be to mankind,so they instilled the second protocol into successive robots. They send out a group of men to take the robots and Banderas out. Banderas's boss accompanies them,but as the big boss wants no other witnesses alive,he is a walking dead man.
Back in the desert it is a long,long trek to the unknown destination he is being taken to. Bandera's pleads for them to take him back to the city but they  cannot comply ,and furthermore fear for their ""lives""there. Eventually they arrive at a location near the chasm of the Grand Canyon. The""clocksmith""(human) that Banderas thought he might find there does not exist. The only one there is a lone robot. It turns out this is the original one the creators created the second protocol for. His goal is to get an old cable car  system going in order to flee to the other side of the canyon and well beyond human reach.
Only one thing stands in their way and that is the insurance company posse sent after them. They finally arrive shortly after Banderas has left;after being given a working vehicle in which to return to the city with. On his way back home Banderas runs into his boss who lies dying on the desert floor. He informs him that the posse has his wife. Banderas rides back to the robots. The posse has so far killed two of the three remaining robots, including the original one. Before they can do in the last one(Cleo) Banderas arrives and runs down most of them. However he is hurt even more and while he takes out one other man with a shot gun,one still remains and is now about to take him out. Suddenly a small robot,shaped like a cockroach(which the original robot had been working on),pushes the man over the precipice.
With Cleo and the ""cockroach"" safely on the other side,Banderas and his wife and new born baby head back to the city. He clutches his newborns fingers just as the city comes into sight,then passes away.
The first half of the film,as I said earlier,had a good pace and storyline going to keep your interest. The whole scenario of what was going on with these errant robots and who or what was behind their alteration was intriguing. But then came the desert flight and the whole film just slowed to a crawl ,thus losing its vitality and spark. The plot suddenly became quite mundane and predictable. It was nice to see Melanie Griffith back in front of the cameras for the short time she was on.
The film itself is in its w/s a/r of 1:77:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette.
All in all a disappointing film,which had a lot of potential to be something smarter than it eventually turned out to be. The acting is good but cannot overcome the mire of the last half of the film. 2 1/2-3 stars.",1422403200,,5157,4.665934065934066

It feels like someone saw I,ROBOT and thought... maybe I can make a different version. The story is also the exact same story as BLADERUNNER, except that in this movie the androids don't come to kill their creator and anguish over being intelligent. In this movie the robots go away. Not much of a storyline, right. This film is gritty and dirty and small and hopeless, and in that way it is technically more realistic. And the robots all look like those Japanese robots we have seen on TV, the ones that mimic human movements. You can tell that the budget was small, lots of dark warehouses and plastic sheets.

I thought the concept was good but the robots were incredibly boring.  And Banderas', (who is a great actor) character just seemed like a blockhead.  ""I have to get back to the city"" I have to get back to the city""

""we can't take you there""  ""i have to get back to the city"" ""it's not safe there.. we can't take you there""..

Automata had elements of I, Robot, Blade Runner and a few others of that ilk.  However, this movie was paced slowly and deliberately.  Nothing in this movie moves very fast with the exception of the odd vehicle.

Melanie Griffith, Banderas' wife, has a small role in this film.  The fact that Banderas is one of the executive producers certainly bodes well for Griffith as she offers little to the film.

Antonio Banderas does great as the protagonist - but somewhere about 80% through the movie I think they lost track and didn't know how to end it.

The robots are pretty cool (and succeed in expressing emotion - despite their rigidity).

Some pretty violent scenes - so not for the kiddos.  This is kind of the opposite bad-news scenario from the Terminator series.  The Terminators kept popping up trying to kill us - where these robots just want to wander away and build their own little robot paradise.

6606818,2,B00N1JQ0N8,"So bleak. I love stories about artificial intelligence and robots and stuff like that. So I was interested in this movie when I happened upon the trailer. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of actually seeing it...
It has nothing to offer: no profound insights into the human condition, no breathtaking cinematography, pretty much nothing you haven't already seen in I, Robot or A.I.:Artificial Intelligence (I loved both of those movies). However, it does lack the humor and grandiose action of I, Robot and the warmth and ability to pull your heartstrings that A.I. had. When you take all of those things away, you wind up with bleak, depressing story set in a bland, desolate world filled with glacial, heartless characters. The humans in this movie act more like cold machines than the actual androids (and the kind sentient androids have no personality either like you'd expect). Maybe that was the whole point, but I still regret seeing this movie. The plot was predictable (except for the main character's total animosity throughout the entire movie toward all of the sentient robots who were just trying to help him), and I gained nothing by the end of the movie except for regret for having wasted my time watching it. It's just a long, painful dive through a hopeless story with no uplifting moments or relief from the dark drudgery. It just made me depressed and pessimistic about the goodness in people, which might have been its goal. If it were, then it succeeded.

6607232,3,B00N1JQ0N8,"Make no mistake, Automata is one of those slow-burning, visually rich sci-fi films that sidesteps action in favor of intellectual exploration, and even though the latter element doesn't hit its mark like Blade Runner, it's worth seeing at least once. Automata is basically about an insurance auditor for a robot manufacturer who feels like his life has hit a brick wall, even though he has a gorgeous wife and a baby on the way. It's only when a robot is killed in the process of modifying itself (a breach of protocol that suggests they are being tampered with and developing independent thought) that this man gets caught between an evolving AI and the greedy corporation he works for.

A lot of reviews have it right with the verdict that the classy cinematography outweighs the substance of the movie's story and characters. We've seen post-apocalyptic futures, evolving AI, and moral dilemmas in a corporate landscape in so many books and films that it seems redundant to see it all over again, but the visuals are quite nice, the setting is established quite effectively, and there are some nice scenes between Antonio Banderas and some of the featured robots, including one that is voiced (surprisingly and eloquently) by Javier Bardem. You can definitely do a lot worse as far as contemporary sci-fi flicks go; if you gave me a choice between seeing this again and watching I, Robot with Will Smith, I would go with the former. As long as you don't expect cinematic greatness or flashy action, Automata will reward you on a subtle level.",1418256000,,1545,4.8522727272727275

It might have been a good movie had it had a decent script.  But pretty much every aspect of what makes a good movie is missing in this Blade Runner wannabe.  I could easily deal with that if it had been done well, but Automata fails on almost every front:  the acting is second-rate by almost everyone; even Banderas' presence brings nothing to the table to save it. In fact, he almost makes it worse than it is.  Automata takes itself far too seriously and provides no humorous moments at all to alleviate the ridiculous dialogue and script. This is a movie where the premise exceeds to the execution of the ideas needed to bring it to life.  Where Blade Runner succeeded admirably in doing this, Automata fails miserably. Even the robots who have supposedly achieved some form of sentience, are boring.  The best thing I can say about Automata is that it was just interesting enough for me to manage to watch all the way through.

6607308,5,B00N1JQ0N8,"Science Fiction Movies are woefully inadequate compared to Literary Science Fiction. SF writers prepare themselves through various Futurist studies, have learned the finer points of narrative composition, maintain the high standards of a genre distinguished by such luminaries as Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Olaf Stapleton, Samuel R. Delany and Larry Niven, and understand and fulfill the challenges of their readers. WOW! What a genre! Then we turn to SF movies, and the tears start to flow. What a sorry excuse - 95% of media SF is neither good fiction nor valid science. It doesn't even attempt to incorporate the advances we find every year when the Hugo and Nebula awards are given. It's pitiful and a shame. The lowest common denominator rules media SF. It may look good on the screen but it is shallow, uninformed and causes brain damage. B-U-T every now and then a SF film arrives that gives us hope for something better in Things to Come. AUTOMATA is one of those happy and welcome surprises. The robots derive from Asimov's and his Three Laws of Robotics play a ghost role. The robots themselves are fully rounded characters, who surprise us again and again with their ambition, altruism and intelligence. And they're pacifists - someday these humane beings will choose a religion, probably Buddhism. In the interim, their decency shames even the good guys like Antonio Banderas's character. This is an intense, unrelenting, honest film, and it is extremely painful to watch. But it is a moral tale of the highest degree of integrity.

And it is like I am Legend because there is one central character who takes us through the entire film with very little supporting cast. The second reason to get this dvd is if you are a big fan of Antonio Banderas. I am a big fan of action films and sci-Fi and there is nothing ground breaking in this film under those to genre.

One of the things I liked was it made me sympathetic to the robots cause, which again is a similar although not familiar theme to what Blade Runner did. The Dystopian elements were well done and the visual aspect of the film was excellent as well as the acting. I'm not a big fan of Antonio Banderas but thought he was strong in this movie and wasn't over the top the way he is in some of his movies. Perhaps some of the negative reviews are because there isn't a ton of action, rather it makes you think. The only negative is I think the ending could have been a bit more dramatic and (spoiler alert) the robot that the robot's built looked like some kind of a weird pet which I didn't think really added any value to the story.",1417737600,,1039,4.226130653266332

The machines look realistic and done in a way that would make sense even in the future.

This could have been a good movie but it is too dreary and slow and ""already been done"".  Plus the caliber of actors in some of the supporting roles is absolutely terrible.  There were even some voice / video sync issues where someone would be talking and the actual words came just a millisecond or two before or after the movement of the lips, like this was some kind of old kung fu film.  There's no excuse for that these days.

The end was just terrible, too.  Antonio has his baby and nobody seems worried they have themselves and their baby right next to what is apparently a nuclear radiation zone... they just sort of hang out and rest now that all the cowboy style gun fighting is over?  Not even close to believable.  So many freaking holes in this movie... just so aggravating to have spent a dime on it.",1417392000,,906,4.4156626506024095

6607411,5,B00N1JQ0N8,"I felt this was far superior to either of the two films to which it is compared - I Robot, and Blade Runner.

(1) Automata has no comforting anthropocentrism, no reassuring resolution to the conflict between humans and machines.

(2) The sensibilities of the movie felt very third world. The dystopic scenery called to mind the favelas and trash fields of our own time.

(3) ""Think how fortunate you are. You have a job, insurance, a pension. Find someone else to pin this on and go home.""

(4) It had literal floating signs (the projected images of nudes), and simulacra (the automata) becoming the real thing (living beings), replacing the original real thing (organic life).

(5) The narrative and visuals were evocative rather than expository.

(6) Antonio Banderas' portrayal of his character was powerful and unique.

The story follows a corporate quality control specialists, Antonio Banderas, whose sole purpose is to prevent machines from breaking the two laws (Asimov had three laws). In his daily investigations he discovers robots that self repair and in short are conscious. Naturally, humans fear this as they would be contending with or competing with a species which is stronger and smarter than humans. Ironically, the Earth's environment in this story has become so inhospitable to humans the environment is more suitable to a conscious machine than people; the doom of humans allowed machines to be free. The machines instead of being competitors seemed to be more sympathetic and compassionate toward humans than their human counterparts; which continues the themes established by Asimov in the Foundation Empire series.",1417219200,,1083,5.4523809523809526

The dual premise that we can serve up software and processing sophisticated enough to actually work in general service capacities -- never mind achieving sentience on its own -- but we can't manage to get a few gears and actuators working any better than an el-cheapo department store animated Christmas display... it just didn't fly for me.

Now that robots have arrived in our own time it's obvious the bipedal human shape is not the practical one for a robot; why do movies always anthropomorphize them, to the ridiculous point in this film that some are even female?

Apparently it's impossible to translate his genius to the screen (see Columbus's Bicentennial Man and Proyas's I, Robot for other disasters).  Ibez (born 30 years after Asimov's brilliant tale was published) was 12 years old when Blade Runner was released.  Judging by his work on Automata it doesn't appear that he has matured past that point.  Automata looks like what you might expect from a 12 year old's attempt to combine iRobot and Blade Runner: it's shallow, devoid of an emotional center, and incongruous.  Wooden acting and poor writing leave no emotional connection with the central characters, neither man nor machine.  The story line was weak and rambling, utterly failing to draw the viewer in.  The cockroach conclusion was laughable.  Sadly this film has virtually nothing to offer.  Read the original iRobot series and see what a little thought and imagination can really do.  Watch Blade Runner again to see how atmosphere can produced by decent cinematography.  Don't waster your time on this bland unimaginative bore.",1416441600,6,1073,5.216374269005848

They make emphasis in the human feelings and senses and the lack of those in a robot, something that we saw in several other movies  That is why they are Automatas and not living beings accordingly with this movie. Other existential conflict marked is the eternal conflict between human beings; instead of joining all together and facing against the extinction, we continue fighting each other until the End.

The director does a wonderful atmospheric job of creating a convincing reality of a post apocalyptic post human pre robotic future.

Trouble is that he takes the premise he set up and drives it to it's inevitable conclusion. All valid. But the conclusion isn't a compelling narrative. Which means the set up wasn't filmable.

Exploration of artificial intelligence ethics: I appreciated the dialogue between the humans and robots and the ethical exploration of coexistence.
Robot design: These robots looked pretty good. I liked the design aesthetics going on.
Musical score: The music fit the mood of the scene.

Bad
Premise: I didn't gather how giant balloons would protect us from solar radiation or how in a society with technological regression could manufacture and maintain intelligent robots. We have a geisha-bot with a holographic display but our protagonist uses a pager?
Character writing: I felt like I was asking, ""Why would you do that?"" for half the movie.

There isn't much to add to what's already been said in the reviews except that IMO enough credit hasn't been given to the short stories of Issac Asimov which I so enjoyed reading when I was in my imaginative youth. The scene of the robots and Vaucan alone in the desert together is a direct adaptation of one of his shorts. Several others come to mind. While I found this movie to be thought provoking it seems to be part of a general meme which has been emerging for several years now. As a species we seem to have reached a point of exhaustion on many levels. If our last real meaningful act is to launch something new to follow in our wake it would be a gesture worth pursuing.

Someone else here commented on ""poor, poor, Melanie Griffith.""

We are hurting our planet home in many different ways.  However as we go forward apparently we can't fix things, effect change in any way, we are our own worst enemy.  So why bring robots, alien invaders, or any other outside menace into the story.  Seems we can destroy our world and ourselves without any help.  That being said this story does make a interesting case for the dangers of robotic helpers and AI (artificial intelligence) beginning to run amok.

Yeah, you kinda want to root for the robots, but they seem destined to be Stephen Hawking trapped in a cyborg body - i.e. easy prey for the bad guys (humans).

I have no faults with this movie if you're just looking for watching some dystopian future with some robots.  They have all the groundwork for this to be a film/book/tv series, but I would be surprised if this got enough popularity to warrant any of those followups.

This has the framework for a ""rise of the machines"" type of film as we are often prone towards seeing (Terminator, I Robot, Matrix, etc), but chooses not to go down that route.  I will admit I was spending much of the film waiting for that to happen, as its what we're used to.  But instead just focused on the very light side of that - the age of humans coming to an end and the torch slowly being passed to a new form of life.

The main issue I have is there's no real... ending.  There's the hollywood ""feel good"" end where it seems as if everything is going to be all right as the main conflict is over, but like... nothing has changed in the city, I'm RELATIVELY sure even small amounts of exposure to radiation is extremely toxic to a baby, having a few bullets in you... maybe I'm over thinking it, but if it was supposed to be a ""not so happy ending"" they could have had the resolution not take as favorable of a turn.

It felt like a good start but the last 3rd of the film was rushed.  That or they thought ""hey we need to save something for the sequel!"".  Given the other reviews of people whom have seen it, I doubt we'll see much more from this universe.",1415059200,,1475,4.250896057347671

6607822,5,B00N1JQ0N8,"This is not an action packed sci fi film with lots of bells and whistles, instead the director went for a slow and thoughtful film with excellent high production value and art direction. There is a philosophical kernel from which the film is based upon and that is the human extinction story NOT the evolution of a singularity which many reviewers seem to think. The film is subtle but very focused on what had become of ""modern man""; you find him dependent on his ""city"" for safety. Irrational when frightened, violent at any perceived threat or anything outside of his intellectual capacity, physically frail and unsustainable, arrogance and hubris towards...well everything. In short man had not evolved passed his emotional and physical limitations and it was this putting him at risk.

The look at the world man has created is equally dire; ecological devastation, inequality among men and increased uncertainty and fear for the future.

The philosophical twist in the film is how man idealizes the notion of non-violence and protection towards life though incapable of living up to that ideal. Fearing for its own safety it invests the machines with two man protocols one being that of non-violence and protection towards ""all life"". The automatons break one protocol but never the second concerning protection of life. Even when they are threatened by humans and since they are quite able to disobey man's orders it is obvious that they uphold this ideal out of choice acknowledging it as a higher value. This choice is evident in their own creation, exemplified by how it saves one human from the violence of another while allowing for the violent man to die.  The following scene has the saved human pointing a gun at the creation and the creation is presented as weighing a decision on whether to fight back or not.

There are reviewers who claim the film is 'derivative' of say Blade Runner when its really a worshipful ode to Philip K. Dick. I would watch this film again and it would be interesting to have a sequel so we can see the final destruction of 'the city' and what kind of world the automatons begin to create and under what principles but I doubt that will happen.  This is not a film for everyone but I would recommend it nonetheless.",1414195200,79,2259,4.796915167095116

The general idea is very interesting, a kind of take of on Asimov's ""I,Robot"" world, with a bit of end of the world disaster apocalypse tossed in.

6607871,4,B00N1JQ0N8,"First off, I watch movies to enjoy them. I don't watch movies to get other people to watch or not watch them. However, I would like to write something about why one movie about robots--I, Robot-- succeeds at the box office and another--Automata--does not. I, Robot with Will Smith most likely had the benefit of Will Smith's riding high at the time. Automata had Banderas, who never really rode high, or as high as Will Smith. Now, I, Robot was a big budget popcorn movie. Automata is a dystopian vision in which popcorn probably doesn't exist. I, Robot didn't require any thinking or reaction--and none was intended. Automata takes on serious ideas, albeit, ideas only beginning to have a future reality and potential impact. I, Robot was a vehicle for a big star. Automata believes it has something to say. Which comes down to whether popcorn is preferable to ideas. Ideas are not an intellectual match for popcorn in I, Robot and in all fairness, were never intended to be. In Automata, the movie theatre ownership hopes you will buy popcorn. The writer, director and actors of Automata don't care if you have popcorn, but I believe they intended that the sound of  popcorn being chewed and the guzzling of sodas did not get in the way of mental involvement, or were mistaken for the sound of one's brain chewing on the ideas in the movie.  Was I, Robot well done as a movie. It certainly had the money behind it. Yes, it was colourful, slick and quite forgettable. Automata, not nearly enough money to make a slick, flashy film. Yet, there is a caring effort to show the audience something different and get them thinking about things to come. Though this, of course, was not the full goal. It also wanted to entertain and have the movie goer  be impinged upon emotionally--because there are still some artists who want to make an emotional impact on the movie goer, as opposed to just making them feel that the best thing about the movie was the popcorn. I thought I, Robot was visually and mentally akin to a comic book--like Spiderman or Avengers. Nothing wrong with that. I enjoy comics and their limited intellectual reach. Automata is visually and intellectually akin to graphic novels. I also like graphic novels. Now, don't get me wrong some comics have made me think and some graphic novels, a number, have the mental impact worthy of the highest cognitive level of a rock. Actually, I've known a few rocks brighter than some people I know. :) In closing, my point is this: a lot of people went to see I, Robot, making the studio and producers and investors a ton of money. Automata, well it probably won't make a tonne of money. But  people who see it will either be positively emotionally moved or be negatively emotionally impinged upon. And that is what movies do, all of them, those viewed by millions down to those only viewed by thousands. So, I found something to like about Automata--maybe you will? Then again, maybe you won't. Just be thankful that watching a movie is no more complicated than that. Thus, the winner of I, Robot versus Automata is? They both win, each in its own way. Therefore, what does that mean for the movie goer? If you saw I, Robot and it numbed your mind and you only enjoyed the popcorn--then you still have the another chance at enjoyment and mental engagement by seeing Automata. If you saw Automata and it either bored you to tears, made you hate it or you enjoyed it, however you enjoyed it, be thankful that movies exist. If, on the other hand, you saw both and liked one over the other--well then, you're are still a winner. But if you saw both and hated both--again you're a winner, because I am quite sure that the future holds lots of movies about robots to love, hate or be indifferent to.

I honestly wanted to turn it off about 70% through the movie and barely made it to the end, although I would've lost very little if I did turn it off.

I'm giving it an extra star because the premise was interesting and the plot more or less kept the robots' actions within the confines of the 2 robot laws introduced in the beginning of the movie.",1413504000,3,724,4.814516129032258
6607886,3,B00N1JQ0N8,"It's a shame a movie like this has such a low budget (apparently). Because, the elements are there to tell a first-class sci-fi story that borrows themes from many great sources, to (potentially) fantastic philosophical end. If you've seen the Animatrix you will no doubt connect the dots with much of the concepts and imagery in those gems (which are themselves, based-on established sci-fi concepts/works). There is real intent in this movie to meld those concepts into a fresh work of art. But, this movie does need a lot more pizzazz. I've purchased it because I want to reward an attempt like this and ultimately see more gambles (like the Matrix series) that get it brilliantly-right, not just barely make it through in a valiant attempt.",1413504000,,744,4.912698412698413

For a movie that's just another variation on ""I, Robot"" crossed with ""Blade Runner,"" at least it takes us and itself seriously, which is nice after all the dumbed-down sci-fi epics thrown at us lately. But we really have seen all this before, and nothing new or surprising happens. In fact, after a strong, Philip K. Dick-style beginning, nothing much at all happens for long stretches. The whole second hour just kind of drifts off aimlessly and almost plotlessly. I confess I dozed off at one point toward the end, but it seems to me that's the movie's fault more than mine.

8675631,1,B00N1JQ0N8,"this began with a simple and intriguing enough concept of a post-apocalyptic future in which robots were built to help fix earth damaged from some manner of abnormal solar radiation which has wiped out the vast majority of humanity.  when it becomes clear the projects assigned to the robots aren't actually working, people start to turn on the robots, directing irrational hatred and frustration towards them that the planet is essentially doomed.

All of that is covered in an introductory expo-dump with title cards and still images.  the movie begins with the idea that these robots are bound by two protocols; never to hurt humans and never to touch themselves (for repair or alteration) and at the start of the film, a randomly drugged up guy finds a robot repairing itself and shoots it in the head.

then we get to Antonio banderas as Jacq Vaucan, who works for the company that makes the robots, has a pregnant wife who does nothing in the film and serves no purpose, and is tasked with figuring out who is responsible for altering the robot that was caught repairing itself.  this somehow leads him and the drugged up cop to Cleo, a robot that has apparently been altered and works as a prostitute.  the drugged up cop played by Dylan McDermott for absolutely no reason at all goes berserk, shoots off Cleo's leg, and says he will slit Jacq's throat next time they meet.

Jacq then encounters the person responsible for altering Cleo, Dr Dupre, and they have an incoherent, tedious philosophical discussion involving evolution and sentience with the clumsy phrase ""Come down from the tree"".

Then, somehow, the movie completely goes off the rails.  It genuinely feels to me that a significant portion of the plot got excised at this point, because out of nowhere the company Jacq works for somehow thinks Jacq is the one responsible for altering the robots and has somehow betrayed his entire species.  They also inexplicably have footage of a robot altering another robot, footage which never appeared at any point earlier in the film, nor do we ever see or later find out where this footage was acquired.

So now the company sends some random hobo children to murder Dr Dupre and Jacq, but Jacq escapes with Cleo.  He then gets knocked out in a car crash and Cleo and a bunch of other robots are now dragging him through the desert, called the ""Sandbox"".  There's a whole lot of time with Jacq whining to the robots and conversing with them.

We also go back to one of the company men, Robert, who hires the drugged up cop to go find and rescue Jacq and bring him back alive, while the company is trying to kill him for no real reason.  The drugged up cop finds Jacq and immediately tries to kill him for absolutely no reason, and Jacq kills him with a flare gun.

The drugged up cop's partner escapes and tells the company that Jacq was in the desert with some robots he says were ""alive"" for no real reason.  The robots did not in any way act differently from regular robots, nor display any sign of disobeying the two protocols at all.  Something went seriously wrong in the writing or editing in this part of the movie.

eventually they take Jacq to a place at the end of the desert where they meet the person responsible for first altering robots... and it's a robot as well.  this one is apparently conscious and self-aware and sentient and has free will and is building a new robot.  All Jacq wants to do is go home.

The company, at this point somehow convinced that Jacq is responsible for altering ALL the robots and trying to escape from them and has some secret heinous plan of some sort which is never explained or even fully described.

The best we get is a backstory expo dump with one of the company executives describing how they made a fully conscious sentient AI that learned everything from humans in 8 days, then became smarter than humans, so they made it develop the Two Protocols for future robots, then deactivated it.

Aside from making for a very interesting backstory, this is in no way relevant to the movie at all, and is never brought up ever again.

So now the company has kidnapped Jacq and Robert's wives and Jacq's newborn daughter for absolutely no reason.  They then send some of their people out to the desert to get Jacq, and then for no reason at all start threatening and intimidating Robert and saying ""You don't have a home anymore"" when Robert panics and says he just wants to go home.  So naturally Robert shoots at the guy who threatened him, then gets shot in turn, having only grazed him.

At absolutely no point is this random betrayal explained in any way.  In fact, when Jacq shows up and finds Robert dying, Robert accuses Jacq of betraying all of mankind, while Jacq literally says that he hasn't even done anything and is just trying to get home.  Robert then tells him they have his wife, and Jacq runs off somewhere.

The robots are now trying to use a ferry to cross over a dry river to get to a radioactive area where they can go on and live free from humans.  The company people then arrive and start killing the robots, apparently thinking they are hiding Jacq or that Jacq is trying to escape with them or something.

Then Jacq appears in a car and runs down most of the company men, then gets into a brief shootout with the head guy.  The head guy then accuses Jacq of betraying mankind and his species and such.  To re-iterate, Jacq has done LITERALLY NOTHING since running from Dr Dupre's hideout.  He hasn't disobeyed company orders (or hasn't been given enough time yet to do so), he hasn't stolen anything, he hasn't been caught doing anything, and yet they've somehow pinned a broad-ranging incoherent conspiracy to him while he was literally being dragged half-dead through the desert.

For no reason, Jacq only seems to implicate himself, by saying that humans are not his people anymore, which leads me to believe that a massive amount of the movie ended up getting cut.  One of the robots, built like a cockroach of some sort, goes and kills the company guy and saves Jacq.  Cleo and the cockroach then go off into the desert and Jacq and his wife go home.

So ultimately, this movie spent about 50 minutes playing out with a moody, noirish vibe somewhat reminiscent of ""Blade Runner"" with hints of I, Robot (the short stories novel), after which literally half-way through it combusts into an incoherent mess of ill-defined accusations, nonexistent conspiracies, and several thoroughly boring sets of scenes in the desert culminating in a curiously tension-free action sequence.

And it bears repeating yet again that Jacq Vaucan has not done a single thing for the entire second half of the movie, yet if you hadn't watched his scenes at all you'd think he was Jason Bourne kicking ass all over the city in a fight to clear his name.",1512777600,,6819,4.616404308202154
