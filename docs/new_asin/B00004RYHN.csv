7921547,5,B00004RYHN,"I rented this film from a French Bibliotechque and am sorry it is not available in Region 1 format.  It is a stunning, unusual film with talented child actors.  The story is of a brother and sister kidnapped from their north African tribe and sold in to slavery in an Arab settlement.  The young boy has an inborn kinship with the African lion, which unsettles his captors, who eventually abandon him in the mountains.  He manages to walk all the way back to his home...he also reunites with his sister.  It's a touching, lovely story in French and the music is great too.  A movie we watched a dozen times as a family.",1231027200,2,619,4.433628318584071
