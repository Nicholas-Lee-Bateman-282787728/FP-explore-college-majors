5690359,5,B00C3OX0NA,"Based on a true story, this film has more heart than any Hollywood ""blockbuster"". Tiny Gibsonburg was hit hard by the recession and needed something to believe in. Well, it sure wasn't their pathetic baseball team, which stumbled to a 6-17 regular season record (7 of those games called by the ""run rule"", which we used to call the ""slaughter rule"" or ""mercy rule""). Then, they began a playoff run, which was simply unbelievable. This is a TRUE independent film with a cast of unknowns (the only people you might recognize in the film are 80's comedian Judy Tenuta and former MLB pitcher Kent Mercker) who do a great job! Even if you don't like baseball, this is a wonderful film about overcoming the odds and growing up. Many people will relate to it",1371945600,7,751,4.611940298507463

5690409,1,B00C3OX0NA,"There is so much wrong with this movie that it is difficult to decide where to begin. I watched it on Amazon Prime so it cost me nothing other than my time. There are many similar story lines in many similar movies.  And as usual we find that this one is (like many others) ""based on a true story"".  That fact alone tells me that any similarity between the ""true"" story and what is portrayed in the movie is purely coincidental (or possibly accidental).
Staffed by a team of unknown actors and what was apparently an extremely low budget, the director took many liberty's on ""time wasting"" or ""fill in"" shots of cherubic young faces gazing into each others bovine like eyes. Perhaps the script was so totally void of meaningful conversation that he had no choice.  Combine this with poor lighting (or a budget which simply could not afford it), an extreme lack of baseball knowledge, limited ""rent a crowds"" for unexciting games and we have a recipe for disaster.
The whole story was supposed to (if we can believe all the advertising blurb) revolve around four friends, all members of ""the team"" which came from behind to win a State Championship. The way they stuck together, supported each other and their fellow team mates, was supposed to be the essence of the tale, but in developing just one of the characters to the level where he actually had a family took everything away from that story.  The original story simply became ""fill in"" background stuff for one family's dice with adversity.
It is an unfortunate fact of life that we must revert back to my original statement that this was a movie ""based on a true story"" and therein lies the problem.",1457395200,2,1657,4.625850340136054

5690423,2,B00C3OX0NA,"Hoosiers (1986) was an example of how a formulaic underdog story, loosely based on a true story, can still be a winner. From the opening sequences, showing the fertile Midwestern farmland, right down to Jimmy Chitwoods winning shot, Hoosiers satisfies. Gibsonburg shows how difficult making such a satisfying story can be. It is also a formulaic underdog story, loosely based on a true story, but in most other ways, it in contrast to Hoosiers. The acting is subpar, the dialogue is awful and the filming seems to reflect the fact that this film had a very small budget. Its one thing to use shadows to create contrast, but much of this film had me wishing someone would pay the electric bill. Part of the problem may be that the film is based on a novel, which was loosely based on a true story. This makes it difficult to know whats real and whats not, and may have contributed to the inauthentic dialogue. Also, the real-life coach has said that the films portrayal of some of the endings of the games is inaccurate. Some license is to be expected, but some of these changes crossed the line into hokey territory. The story of Gibsonburg High Schools state championship run is a great story, but this film, despite a lot of sincerity, is not a good telling of it.",1451433600,2,1266,4.581497797356828

I LOVE IT.  ( I'm glad that I didn't  read the reviews first, but gave it a chance first.)
The cinematography is  EXCELLENT as far as  the  crispness and or  shades of mistiness & fog rising across the  river or fishing ponds.
The  COLOUR  is  grand.
The introduction tells the viewer that  the movie is  based on a true story.
AND,  the the movie  was  acted and filmed by  not Hollywood;  but  college students  ~  and  DANG,  I think that they did a
really  GOOD to excellent  job of it, too.
I found it to be alternately  a bit of a mystery, with touches of wee bits of humor & romance ~  It's  definitely a  FILM ABOUT  FRIENDSHIPS,
WORKING TOGETHER  AS  A TEAM,  BEING  PART OF  A FAMILY ,  and  COMMUNITY.
****I've seen  many  really great and excellent  films  AND  I've  seen some  real duds that  stank to high heaven  or  even worse.
THIS  IS  ,  I think,  in the running for  definitely  ABOVE AVERAGE  to  REALLY,  REALLY GOOD &  approaching GREATNESS.
****Trivia film  fact ~~  :""It's A Wonderful Life""  was  not  a big  box office hit movie  at first ,  but  by word-of-mouth  it  grew and grew in popularity.  I can  envision  something  like that  happening  to  this  BASEBALL  'diamond' in the rough.
