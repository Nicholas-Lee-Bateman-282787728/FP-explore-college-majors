Mr Humphries and his Mom, Mrs Humphries both brilliantly played by the great John Inman, discuss Mr Humphries' memories of working at Grace Brothers. The plot revolves around that and Mrs Humphries, who while on vacation in Hollywood USA, meets a movie producer who believes the stories about Grace Brothers would make a great movie. Mr H and his Mom recall and discuss the memories - and Mrs H encourages sher son to start writing.
The interaction between them is wonderful. A great addition to your AYBS collection.",1385337600,,554,4.842105263157895

7925067,3,B00004WG4F,"This is a nice collection of highlights for the fan who is familiar enough with the episodes to remember the context from which said highlights are taken. As others have noted, however, the humor really works better in context and it's much more fun to watch a couple of the episodes in their entirety that it is to watch these isolated snippets. Furthermore, I find John Inman in drag as Mr. Humphreys' mother to be funny in measured doses, but that act suffers from overexposure here.
In short, this is mediocre at best. To really experience AYBS to the fullest, sit down with a couple of full episodes and prepare for some laughs.",1022198400,4,633,4.610619469026549
