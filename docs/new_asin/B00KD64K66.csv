6416096,5,B00KD64K66,"I watched this documentary, and I loved it. Ashleigh Ball (the voice of Applejack and Rainbow Dash) is very sweet, and very open minded, considering when this was filmed the entire fandom was just getting underway to the point where people were noticing. She had no idea what to expect, and I am glad to see she came away from it with a positive outlook. It was also nice to finally see some faces behind the names of other notable members of the fandom that I've known about for more than 3 years.

We get to see a number of different locations, meet a diverse cast of Bronies, and really get a look at how and why they love the show, the culture, and just what the fandom means to them. I do recommend buying it, and supporting it, because it is a labor of love, and the message is worth hearing. It's not ""look at me, I'm going to meet Bronies, how weird is that?"" it's all about experiencing things that are different, trying out new points of view, and getting to understand the people behind them better than you did, and maybe, just maybe, enjoying the ride.

This film is a time capsule of the fandom, in that the Brony community has soared in population over these past two years (since the documentary was filmed). It's also a thoughtful exploration of how it looks on the other side of the curtain, and an enjoyable romp with old friends. I can't recommend it enough.",1405900800,12,1378,4.4
6416117,5,B00KD64K66,"I watched ""Bronies"" a few weeks ago and when my son wanted to watch this one I was excited to see it as well. Totally enjoyed it. This one focuses on Ashleigh and how her view changed as she met more and more bronies (as opposed to ""Bronies"" which focused more on just different bronies and their experiences. So cute and sweet and gives more insight into the brony phenomenon. Bonus: The manliest brony alive is interviewed. :)",1412553600,2,428,4.5
6416118,5,B00KD64K66,"The first time this movie was revealed and was said to appear in select, independent theaters, I thought ""that's nice"". It didn't matter to me much. Two days before the screening, I had a change of heart and decided to go in the end. Besides, it was nearby and was one of the limited theaters showing it across the U.S.

After seeing that documentary, I got to say it was one of the best films I've seen to date in my opinion. For some strange reason I got paralyzed a bit from greatness (yes, I'm serious... paralyzed) The film explains perfectly what it means to be a proud Brony and to be yourself no matter what. Not that we're just some weird, creepy, perverted 30 year olds living in their  parents basement. Watch this film if you're skeptical about Bronies and learn what this ""little girls"" show has done to our lives.",1412208000,,827,4.434210526315789

6416120,5,B00KD64K66,"I have always been a My Little Pony fan since I was a little a girl, my sister told me about a revamped version of this show a few years ago. She told me about it because of my love of almost all cartoons and of course MLP, although I had heard somehow that it had a very large male following I was quite surprised. So, It was nice to see a movie about how these fans came to be and its even better that its through the eyes of one of its stars. Thanks for giving me a different perspective into the fandom.",1411516800,,507,3.8846153846153846
6416121,4,B00KD64K66,"The movie has some excellent interviews that capture the feeling if the Brony community. It does, however, leave out acknowledgement of the writers and artists who were involved in the show's creation, which I feel should have been given at least a mention for their contribution to the community.",1411171200,,297,5.081632653061225

6416124,5,B00KD64K66,"I enjoyed this documentary. I especially loved Ashleigh Ball's segments on her past voice-over work and her journey to BronyCon. In addition, a brony by the name of DustyKatt (a.k.a. The Manliest Brony in the World) said something in the film that grabbed my attention. He said that we shouldn't think of the Mane 6 as six ponies, but as six friends who help each other. I would recommend this film to bronies who love ""My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic"" and to people who want to know what the brony phenomenon is all about.",1407628800,7,527,4.557894736842106
6416125,5,B00KD64K66,A Brony Tale is the best documentary to show people who are still curious about this fandom and why it's so popular. Director Brent Hodge tells the story through the mind of Ashleigh Ball on her trip to a brony convention in New York. This documentary is amazing and well put together that you can watch this movie from beginning to end.,1407369600,5,337,4.451612903225806

8657769,5,B00KD64K66,"Unexpectedly cute. Loved this documentary about the Bronies! I became interested in Brony culture when I started working alongside a confirmed Brony- he has a keychain and a lanyard featuring Rainbow Dash, his favorite My Little Pony character, and is not ashamed at all to admit he is a Brony and he is even proud of it (he is a very sweet guy with a girlfriend and a good person but I never expected he was a Brony and a hard-core fan of My Little Pony Freindship Is Magic the caroon).  I had to know more about Bronies so I ordered this.  Conventions, online creations, and more, this is very much like Star Wars conventions and other fans gathering due to their favorite shows and it's about the fandom they share.... It is very sweet and you will be surprised when you watch it to learn just who the Bronies are.",1477785600,,817,4.403973509933775

8657773,4,B00KD64K66,"When I first learned about Bronies I couldn't believe my ears.  Then I watched the documentary ""Bronies"" and it scared the tail off of me.  Watching Ashleigh's reaction to discovering that she has become a cult figure without her knowledge is hilarious and well done.  She is very diplomatic but appears a bit surprised at what she is a part of.  Hey, as long as Bronies don't hurt anyone, they are fine with me.  I should have bought stock in ""My Little Pony"" 20  years ago, who knew?",1439251200,,485,4.454545454545454
8657774,5,B00KD64K66,"Saw this movie at a theater premier in Portland, OR, got to ask the director a question even! An excellent, accurate, fair documentary, so much so that I passed this DVD copy on to my parents as a Christmas present last year to help them understand what bronies and ""Friendship Is Magic"" is all about.

There is apparently another documentary that critics of this video recommend instead. Personally, I think the focus on the voice actress Ashleigh Ball and her struggle to understand the phenomena she gets wrapped up in makes this ideal for people who are not bronies but would like to understand the phenomena. According to the director at the Q&A session, he himself is not a brony but has grown to understand the fandom. In other words, this is by ""outsiders"" and it is likely that ""outsiders"" will enjoy it a little more.",1425340800,3,827,4.664383561643835

8657776,2,B00KD64K66,"First, I am not a fan of My Little Pony, but I do love human interest stories and documentaries.

The Brony fandom first came to my attention when I watched another documentary called , "" Bronies "". After that, I started noticing the fandom more frequently, including a guy in my systems department at work. I was happy to watch this documentary, but pretty disappointed.

Why is the voice actor on the cover? The documentary goes back and forth between actually focusing on Bronies and boring segments about the narcissistic voice actor and her life outside of My Little Pony. She was annoying and came off as fake. She acted like she had no idea about the fandom. Snooooze. Did not care.

The good part of the documentary is where we actually saw interviews with the fans. They are a normal fandom really except they are men who like a show deemed for little girls. You see how they connect with the show and how they turn it into community, art, music, etc. I wish they would have dug deeper into the fans and their lives.

I wouldn't 't recommend it because it isn't truly about the people, more about one person.",1417132800,6,1117,4.514851485148514
8657777,1,B00KD64K66,disapointing. boring low budget. Ashleigh seemed very uncomfortable with the attention. fast forwarded through most of it. my husband likes mlp fim but hated this movie,1416700800,3,168,5.5
8657778,2,B00KD64K66,"Not that long ago I had the misfortune of watching the first Bronies documentary, The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony. You can find my review for that on its page, where I gave it 2 stars, mainly because they seemingly conned fans out of money, putting together a documentary where 50% of it was an ad for Bronycon, and they didn't address any of the real issues people have with Bronies. When I heard about another Brony documentary being released a few months ago, I sighed when I saw Morgan Spurlocks name attached, but figured that it couldn't do any worse than the first one. Having just watched it a few minutes ago, I can say that yes, A Brony Tale -is- definitely slightly better than the first documentary, but still an embarrassment for all the same, and some new, reasons.

Before I even go into the review, let me say it again- I have nothing against the show, or the Bronies. I haven't seen enough of MLP to have a real stance on it, and all I know is what Ive learned when Id read the comics to my daughter, and what shed tell me about it. I have nothing against someone whos a big fan of anything, as long as its noting legitimately bad, as in it could put people at harm. That being said, after watching two documentaries on Bronies, I still don't get what it is about the show that made these people come out by the thousands, whereas something very similar like Powerpuff Girls, didn't even get a fraction of the male fans when it first aired.

Its hard to even call A Brony Tale a documentary about Bronies when half of the film is covering Ashleigh Ball, voice actress for Rainbow Dash and Applejack, as she talks about her work with the show, her history with voice acting, and her decision to go to Bronycon. In between these segments with Ashleigh, we get interviews with Bronies as they talk about their love for the show and they defend their choice to like My Little Pony. Theres a bigger variety of people here than in the previous documentary, which was mostly younger kids (and one angry dad), and once again, we get a look at Bronycon, although its a much quicker glance since its towards the very end of the movie.

From a DJ to a body builder to a biker whos hailed as a manly-man (I rolled my eyes more than once during this segment), different guys are interviewed as they talk about how much they like the show. Most of the guys come off as fine, but the severe lack of talking about anything else or what else they do in their lives makes it seem like all they care about is MLP. These interviews felt really forced, like the filmmakers were trying to convince the viewer that Look! These guys do guy stuff! They like the show too! See?? Everythings ok if they like it!!. Even worse is that, yet again, psychologists are brought in to talk about how Bronies are, in their unique way of putting it, better in some ways than normal men, because they're less prone to violence and aggression. Of course the psychologists are wearing their white coats while on-camera, and fail to talk about certain issues, just like the previous documentary. The only thing thats addressed here is how weird it is that men like this show. How about some of the darker things no ones talking about here? Sure, you could argue that they want to be more positive, but if you're making a documentary about Bronies showing that everythings ok, wheres their defense for select fan art? Can anyone explain why theres such an abundance of it? Why should adult content filters have to be on for would-be innocent searches for My Little Pony art? You could argue that its up to the parent to watch what their kids look at all you want, but do a search for yourself with the filter on, and youll see that it still pops up in no time.

I appreciated that less time was spent on Bronycon, with more time covering the Bronies as a whole, rather than a couple of individuals. The big problem is that they only get half of the screen time. Ashleigh seems like a really cool woman, and I definitely want to check out her bands music now. But just like with the other documentary, that spent an awful lot of time with Lauren Faust and Tara Strong for some reason (not that Im against seeing more of Tara), Ashleigh may as well be the star of this movie. She rarely talks about the fandom, and shares a lot of stories about doing voices. Thats fine and all, but what is it doing here? The documentary isn't even an hour and a half, and so much time is dedicated to her that it seems like the filmmakers couldn't figure out what else to talk about regarding Bronies, so they just used as much footage of her as they could. Side note- count the number of close ups on her rear when shes riding her bike in the beginning.

A Brony Tale is just another documentary on the male fans of MLP that fails to hit the mark. Unfortunately, Bronies are too accepting with things, and will probably like this film just because its about them, not looking at anything past that. Im giving it the same rating as The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans because it does both better and just as bad as that one. And when I looked up what others thought about the movie on its IMDB discussion board, this tidbit from darkdoomer-163-739368 says it all:

""These people who made this movie don't know the real fandom, the real community and just select the same sociopathic bronies to expose : the drones. lurking in conventions and doing nothing creative but bragging about the fact they watch a little girl's cartoon.

can we have once and for all a movie, or something that is related to MLP FIM and the philosophy of the series, why it works, how Anon use it? Why people draw and make fanworks?

""Oh look at these guys, they are so open minded redefining masculinity dressed in pink~""""",1414972800,5,5778,4.4289746001881465
