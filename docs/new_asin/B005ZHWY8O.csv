8489689,5,B005ZHWY8O,"Hard-driving, soul-stirring music and vocals. This is truly anointed music. Nancy is at her best in the title song and Jimmy Swaggart in the background makes it all come together perfectly. It doesn't get much better than this in Gospel Music. The title song alone would make it worth the cost.",1466208000,,294,4.784313725490196
