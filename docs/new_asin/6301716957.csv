7814217,1,6301716957,"Ira Angustain may look exactly like Freddie Prinze, but that's where the resemblance ends. He has none of the razor-sharp wit or intensity of the real person. It would have been more convincing if they'd picked an actor who looked less like Freddie but had a more similar personality.",1390608000,2,284,4.816326530612245
7814218,3,6301716957,"This was A sad story that i thought that the Entertainer that did the portrayal of the original person did pretty good job. and unfortunate that the entertainer that portrayed the original person got a bad rap for doing the movie.
I sort of wonder what Ever Happened to  Ira Angustain???  Did he get a name change after doing this movie or did he change his career?
The entertainer that he portrayed had the personality like a Male version
of Alice from the  Twilight saga(I thought) always wanted to share things like his way was the way to do it, and he would get all excited or he would be down in the dumps.
I personally liked the entertainer that was portrayed of. and I thought Ira Did a good job doing the not so nice stuff that could of been done not so nice.
Senor- Freddie Mmmm its kind of touchy to say, I liked him alot but, to talk about him well that still is kind of questionable?

7814219,1,6301716957,"This movie was very negative. It did not tell us anything about who Freddie Prinze was as a person, his family, his jewish father or his Puerto Rican mother. The characters were all unrealistic and their actions were very stereotypical. The actor in this movie had a difficult time telling jokes making it hard to believe he could be such a talented comedian. Also it is implied that New Yorkers are naive hicks when compared to West coast politics. I feel this movie portrayed a famous latino (Stateside Puerto Rican) in a extremely stereotipical way harmful to the identity of Latinos in the USA and did not teach us anything about the true talent and life of Freddie Prinze. This movie is not worth watching...",1295222400,4,713,4.712
7814220,2,6301716957,"This movie is full of inaccuracies and seemed to just want to cash in on Freddie's death. The film states it was based on articles, etc., so need I say more? They added things in that were untrue, which is disrespectful to Prinze. Time and care could have been taken to produce a factual movie. I'd only recommend this movie as a collectible if you are a fan, but don't take it as gospel.",1205884800,6,388,4.256756756756757
7814221,5,6301716957,I had forgotten just how much Freddie was unable to come to grips with his fame and fortune. So sad for such a talented guy.,1127865600,4,124,4.0
7814222,5,6301716957,"This is a great movie based on the reknowned 70's comedian""Freddie Prinze""(Chico and The Man).It's a must see!!",1105920000,2,111,5.222222222222222
