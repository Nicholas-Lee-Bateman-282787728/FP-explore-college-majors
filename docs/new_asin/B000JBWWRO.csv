2667419,3,B000JBWWRO,"So yeah, I haven't seen this movie.  I probably will and it probably won't be terribly stupid as some sequels are, but this pains me.  Greatly. Cinderella two was not the greatest disney sequel.  The Little Mermaid 2 and Mulan 2 were both better.  So why is it that this one get's a 3? Why should any of them get a 3?  If anyone from disney reads this--PICK ANOTHER FAIRY TALE!!! There's lots out there that haven't been disneytized.  Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltzkin, and then there are the ones from other coutnries that western europe and Grimm and stuff.  China--like Mulan--good movie.  Make something new and original again.  Please!!! Parents, babysitters, and teachers who have to watch these things beg you!!",1162684800,10,710,4.899159663865547

2667427,4,B000JBWWRO,"For my little sister I bought this movie and watched it with her. In some ways it is just as charming as the first one. Giving an idea of the what- ifs. The shoe doesn't fit and Cinderella is forced to rely on herself rather than her godmother's magic. It shows a refreshingly  assertive and in charge of her own destiny  young woman. It gives a better look at Prince Charming and his own fight to act in the way that will make him happy, despite the stepmother getting hold of the godmother's wand.",1441152000,,499,4.297872340425532

2667441,5,B000JBWWRO,"this is a awesome movie. this was a lot better than Cinderella 2. this is one of my favorite sequels. if I put them in order it would be Cinderella, Cinderella 3, Cinderella 2. to me it seemed like they took more time on this one that they did on the second one. the story was good the animation is awesome and the voice acting was good. after seeing this one I know have put stepmother in my top 10 best Disney villains. if you thought she was bad before. this shows you how much she hates Cinderella and wants to ruin her life. this is a great movie and prince charming gets more screen time. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do",1416528000,,650,4.0859375

2667461,4,B000JBWWRO,"I am a huge Disney movie fan and while I enjoyed the first film, I was very disappointed with the second. It had no real villain, plot line, and the characters remained very flat overall. I started watching III without high hopes as a result. I was pleasantly surprised.
Not only have Lady Tremaine and Lucifer managed to return to be as evil, if not more so, than in the first film, the animation was just as beautiful as the original with several new catchy songs that match the same themes that were in the beginning--Try comparing ""It Was Only a Dream"" with Cinderella's first song, ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" and the mice's ""At the Ball"" with ""Cinderelly"".
Best of all, there is some real character development going on here rather than trite little moral tales like in the second installment.  I actually like the Prince in this film because he doesn't just sit around waiting for someone else to bring him the girl that he fell in love with. He has more than just good dancing skills--he goes after the girl, he is kind, and he has quite a few good one-liners in this movie as well.  I particularly loved his reaction to Cinderella's animal friends/side kicks. Even his father moves past the wish for grandchildren to have a bit more depth in this film.
Cinderella has also grown a spine (finally).  She directly stands up to her step mother like never before, finally gives Lucifer what he so justly deserves, and instead of just wishing for a happily ever after, she chases her's down multiple times in this film.  Cinderella has finally learned that perseverance doesn't just apply to faith and hope, but to actions as well, and I say Bravo to her for it.
A thoroughly good sequel that far outstrips Cinderella II in all aspects, this is definitely worth watching for any fan of the Disney animated classics.",1395532800,,1828,4.598159509202454
2667462,5,B000JBWWRO,"this is a good movie for the kids, obviously. my daughter loved it and has probably watched it 100 times now. thank you",1394841600,,119,4.217391304347826

2667464,5,B000JBWWRO,"Cinderella III is a fun movie.  It has a good storyline, is exciting, and has a twist at the end.  Although it wasn't released in the theater, my daughter and I like it just as much as the original.",1391472000,,198,4.051282051282051

2667469,4,B000JBWWRO,"My daughter loves Cinderella but this story line made her cry. We fast forwarded to the ending so she could see that Cinderella ended up with the Prince.

2667477,4,B000JBWWRO,It's great movie and a creative way to spin the classic Cinderella tale! The shipping was fast (even faster than the other sellers I bought from). The disc and case are in great condition; disc doesn't have any scratches or if it does they're not noticeable and the case has light wear. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is because it didn't come with the information mini packet the usually comes on the side. Other wise it was a great deal and it's a great movie!,1374019200,,480,4.285714285714286

2667491,4,B000JBWWRO,"We've watched the original Cinderella over and over again. I've seen this movie in the store but am leery about some of the straight to DVD Disney movies. It was actually pretty cute. The plot-line is simple, the evil Step Mother gets a hold of the Fairy Godmother's wand and does just about anything to ruin Cinderella's happily ever after. Without ruining the whole movie... there was a scary part towards the end with Cinderella trapped in a pumpkin that I didn't feel was as child friendly as I would have liked. There was also a part where Anastasia looked exactly like Cinderella that was confusing at best to my little one...she didn't understand why there were two Cinderella's. On the whole it was a cute Disney movie. Cinderella acted more like a heroine in this movie, taking matters into her own hands instead of the 'poor me' 1950s housewife that she seems to portray in the first movie.",1356480000,,900,4.666666666666667
2667492,5,B000JBWWRO,Very cute.  All three cinderella movies are done well.  This one is no exception.  Would highly recommend to all Cinderella fans.,1356480000,,129,5.0476190476190474
2667493,4,B000JBWWRO,"The product itself arrived on time, and as for the actual film, I enjoyed it. I don't think Cinderella really needed a sequel, but either way, it's watchable. I liked seeing more of Prince Charming and seeing how strong their love really was.",1356393600,,242,4.651162790697675

2667502,5,B000JBWWRO,"I am a mom and my daughters adore the Cinderella story. So when I found that there was more movies based on the original Disney version I got excited. The second movie that came out was ho hum but the third movie (this one)....was awesome. Disney mirrored the look and feel of the original movie so much so that you could watch both movies back to back and think it was one long movie. The songs, the pace and the idea behind this movie are awesome. Every time we watch it I am still amazed and enjoy it. If you haven't seen this movie I highly recommend it. So much fun.

2667505,5,B000JBWWRO,"I was expecting this to be terrible. For something that was straight to DVD, I'm impressed by the quality of the animation.

2667522,4,B000JBWWRO,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I saw this movie.  Most Disney sequels are unwatchably awful, and ""Cinderella II"" wasn't very good.  However, ""Cinderella III: A Twist in Time"" is excellent (for a direct-to-video release).

The animation is very good, the music is passable, and the plot is interesting, but what really stands out are the characterizations of Cinderella and the prince.  The prince was very flat in the original film, but here he's got a recognizable personality, he's nice, and he's not stupid; the evil stepmother has to use magic in order to get him to go along with her scheme.

Cinderella shows more of a recognizable backbone.  In the original film, I used to see her as nothing more than singing sugar and fluff. It wasn't until years and years later that I realized what a strong and impressive character she is, able to hold onto her forgiving, sweet-natured, positive outlook on life, which is _really_ hard to do for a person who has suffered the kind of abuse that Cinderella has.

So Cinderella actually is a strong character in her original movie, but for some reason it's hard to recognize her strength, because I know I'm not the only one who overlooked it. In ""Cinderella III,"" her strength is more easily recognizable. She has realistic reactions to heartbreaking situations, and she gets very strong in addition to still being nice and kind.  One of Cinderella's scenes near the end of the movie even felt a little bit like an animated fantasy action flick.

The ending, though a little unexpected, was also very satisfactory.  The only real complaints I have are that the beginning of the movie was over-the-top silly, and Anastasia's romance from ""Cinderella II"" was not mentioned except for a single image in the ending credits. But overall, if you like Disney movies, ""Cinderella III"" is definitely one to watch.",1307232000,,1856,4.882165605095541
2667523,5,B000JBWWRO,"My daughter is almost 4yrs old and regularly pops this DVD in before she reaches for the original Cinderella. Now I'm not here to take anything away from the Original nor do movie reviews where I attack the storyline etc. The movie is just what it says, a twist. This is a very vividly animated, too funny and touching spin off. So glad I added it to her collection because its on heavy rotation!",1306627200,,396,4.364864864864865

2667527,4,B000JBWWRO,"Most of us have seen the original version of Disney's Cinderella the story of a cinder girl who over came obstacles with the help of her fairy godmother to finally marry her prince, and live happily ever after. with that said, it was a beautiful animated film but quite honestly I thought the original Cinderella story was too simple and kind of boring, but Cinderella III-A Twist in Time was WAY! better then the original film

Why because the story was richer and it had more layers to savor, also the animation was just as good as the original, YES I said it, ok most Disney films that are made just for DVD release have a very poor animation quality. but not this the second DVD sequel I loved the fact that they kept the same level of animation and didn't slack off just because its a DVD release like some of the other straight to DVD Disney remakes.

This one was a great one, and personally I think this sequel should of had a theater release because the animation stayed true to what Disney is known for I highly recommend it, though the DVD only has a music video featuring actress Hayden Panettiere, no audio commentary or making of short for us adults that was one slight disappointment, but over all a great film get it its very fun.",1304121600,,1246,4.413043478260869

2667556,1,B000JBWWRO,"My 5 year old watched this movie, as it was rented for her.  She loved the first one, she thought the second one was OK, but she really did not like this one.  Mostly because it was a negative tone, they didn't get married, have the happily ever after, etc, etc...

She started crying after awhile, and told me she didn't want to watch it anymore, and we sent it back to Blockbuster after about just 35 minutes watched or so.  I put on the original one (which we own), and she was OK again, but she most certainly did not like this one.

If you have really young girls who are into the princess thing, they may not like this, since it somewhat ruins or at a minimum brings down what little girls have in their heads as fantasy from Princess Land.  :)",1269907200,2,750,4.173611111111111
2667557,5,B000JBWWRO,"I rented this film so my husband and I could go on a date and leave a new film with the babysitter. I actually started watching it while I got ready! My babies loved it and I had to re-rent it twice as it's no longer available on shelves. While this is not to be compared to the ""moving art"" of the 40's and 50's Disney films it is a fantastic story!

Cinderella is a sweet, kind, caring and graceful girl who gets to live a Happily Ever After life thanks to her friends the mice and her fairy Godmother. But what if the magic that propelled Cinderella to ""Princess"" was in the wrong hands? Cinderella's fairy tale is rewound and rewritten leaving our heroine to fend for herself. I was impressed that Cinderella maintained her sweet and happy demeanor even while taking responsibility for her future. In today's world it's refreshing when a girl can maintain grace, dignity, and class while still reaching for and obtaining her dreams.

Some of the songs that Cinderella sings are very pretty and they did well in finding a voice talent that would come close to the original actress both in demeanor and pitch. A few of the songs can get kind of cheesy and the mice have a bit of a tendency to really annoy you but I promise you'll be watching your babies act out to and laugh at these moments. This movie is geared towards young children with enough of a plot to stand on its own and to be enjoyed by all ages. The animation is brighter than in the original but tries to maintain ""the look"" of Cinderella and her fellow cast. The moral of the story is that if you believe in Love and in yourself you can do anything, even without Disney's signature dose of magic.

I would recommend this product to anyone looking to revisit the world of Cinderella. You won't leave disappointed this time.",1266796800,,1791,4.421212121212121

Wandering around the local movie store one night, lo and behold there Cinderella III was on the shelf, giving me the perfect opportunity to watch it before I bought it.

So I checked it out, took it home and watched it.  And was more than happy with what Disney created. Granted its not the original, but this is still a great story with good animation.

2667590,4,B000JBWWRO,"I know alot of people hate the ""sequel"" Disney movies simply because they feel their creation ""desecrates"" the memories of the originals.  Ah but do remember, these were never ""original"" Disney properties to begin with, they were softer retellings of fairy tales or other classic novels.

Cinderella III is an entertaining movie.  It's animation is quite fluid, with a few mistakes here and there, it is still a bright, vibrant movie with consistent character designs.  The storyline is an ""alternative"" storyboard, where the characters are forced back in time and down different paths for the sake of the storyboard.  This makes things interesting, and even the comedic bits are either slapstick, or subtle intelligent and amusing.

The bottom line is that this is one of the best things Disney has released in recent years... their non-Pixar CG movies have been terrible (""Chicken Little"" almost unwatchable it was so bad) and not much else has come from the studio.

Anyone that loves fairy tales, Cinderella, alternate timelines (a popular device in Sci Fi and fantasy) etc will enjoy this movie.  My daughter is three and this is by far her favorite film right now (yes, even over ""classics"" like ""Cinderella One"" as she calls it, etc).",1197849600,,1241,5.019512195121951

2667604,5,B000JBWWRO,"OK, I admit, I didn't want to spend the money and started out by borrowing this one from the library.  In fact, I played it for my almost 3 year old daughter while I took a shower, because I really wasn't all that interested in a direct to DVD video.

She requested it again (and again, and again).  Finally one day I needed to get some work done and set up the laptop in the family room while she was watching.  Needless to say, I didn't accomplish much for the duration of the movie.  LOL!  What a refreshingly fun story!  I love that Cinderella takes charge of her own destiny instead of being ""saved by the handsome prince"".  I also like the character development of Anastasia - although I found it a little difficult to swallow the thought of  her as a sympathetic character, it did work very well.  You saw the progression of change, so it made sense.  Not a big fan of the ""I knew I was in love the moment I touched her hand"" thing, but it is still a fairy tale, after all.

The animation of the faces is even better than the original.  Cinderella's expressions are gorgeous and tug at your heart.  The voices are wonderful, too.  And very true to the original.",1194998400,,1168,4.293577981651376

Some funny parts include Anastasia stepping all over the Prince's feet, and lacking poise and grace during a dance much to the Prince's dismay, and Anastasia and Drusilla's food fight destroying the entire dining room and covering it with cake, and pastries.  The King's expression when he opens the door, and out flies a cake, and he asks if  he is in the right room.  The prince's expression when Anastasia steps on his feet numerous times, and Anastasia's apologies. Another funny part is when the Stepmother & Drusilla are changed into a couple of toads at the end. Some of the scarier moments include when the wicked Stepmother breaks Cinderella's glass slipper, and when Cinderella is banished on a ship out of their lives forever.  Another scary part is when the wicked stepmother puts Cinderella in a pumpkin ""coach"" wagon  and tells Lucifer to make sure Cinderella does not come back alive. Cinderella 3 will  not disappoint.

2667606,4,B000JBWWRO,"I was very excited when the original Cinderella movie came out on DVD and I immediately ordered my copy.  This was my all-time favorite Disney movie.  Along with this DVD set came a preview for Cinderella III which was to be released in the future.

I hesitated for a very long time before buying Cinderella III because I feared that it would not live up to the original movie and that it would end up really tarnishing the magical movie that I grew up loving so much through my childhood.  I thought it would be best just to have the original movie as it was with no sequel.

Well, today I decided to buy the movie and I just finished watching it.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Granted, this movie is not on the same level as the original, but it does have a certain magic and beauty of it's own.  For this reason, I do recommend that Cinderella fans add this movie to their collection.

The basic plotline of the movie is straightforward.  Lady Tremaine, the wicked stepmother, gets hold of the fairy godmother's wand and uses it to reverse the events leading up to Cinderella marrying the prince.  This leaves Cinderella and her animal friends to fix this terrible situation.

The movie is filled with suspense and action.  As a 32 year old man, I found myself jumping up out of my seat at times while watching this movie.  It was like being taken back to my childhood again.

Any Cinderela fan will thoroughly enjoy this movie. It has a very unexpected ending that will surprise everyone.  But I can assure you that everything turns out fine in the end.  Everyone, and I do mean ""everyone"" will get exactly what they deserve.

Although you probably won't want to get this one out to watch as much as the original movie, it really is a fitting sequel and you should have it in your collection.  It doesn't destroy the magic of the original movie at all.",1191542400,,1872,4.452941176470588

The chacter voices are similar to the orginial and the animation is really good.  The cat still causes trouble and is just as funny as in he first movie.  The Stepmother is the evil familar character that is in the first movie.  I like the fact that even though there are bad people out there, it shows that they can have a change of heart.

The story is interesting and moving. You really get wrapped up in Cinderella's plight as the Stepmother's level of evil goes through the roof.

Prince Charming finally gets a personality, and he is such a wonderful character! The animation and voices were so well done that I believe this could have made it in the theaters!

Even the songs were very enjoyable, though Disney sequel songs often leave a great deal to be desired.

Only two blue birds and Jacque and Gus gus appear (forget about any of the other characters they never appear), and Anestasia gets a conscious? Are you kidding me?

2667617,4,B000JBWWRO,"I'm a very big fan of most of Disney's work.  The company has, for the most part, put out wonderful products on the movie screen, on the page, and on compact discs and DVDs.  The one place that I find Disney to be weak is in the direct-to-DVD sequel department.  The shows on these discs are rarely up to par with their cinematic counterparts.  Very few of them are worthy of purchase.  One that is, however, is ""Cinderella III-A Twist In Time.""  It's a wonderful sequel to the Disney classic in which the wicked stepmother gets her hands on the fairy godmother's wand.  With it she erases all of the events that lead up to and include the marriage of Cinderella and her Prince Charming.  After doing this, she makes sure that the glass slipper fits her daughter, Anastasia, and eventually tricks the prince into wanting to marry her.

With only her mouse friends to help her, Cinderella sets out to get the love of her life back.  Along the way, we get a deeper look into the wicked stepmother and her daughters as well as some of the lesser characters from the original tale.

I find it hard to believe that this film is a direct-to-DVD sequel.  The animation is excellent.  All of the voice performances are executed well.  Most importantly, the story is actually very good.

The DVD contains a few special features including a music video of ""I Still Believe"" by Hayden Panetierre, DVD-ROM features, and a game.  Overall it is worthy of purchase for fans of Cinderella and the whole Disney ""Princess"" line.

2667619,4,B000JBWWRO,"What if the greatest romance in fairytale history never happened?  That's the premise of Disney's newest straight-to-video sequel, CINDERELLA III: A TWIST IN TIME.  While I was initially very skeptical about this release, the final product is well-executed with a good storyline and gripping plot development.

When Cinderella's stepmother Lady Tremaine steals the magical wand of the Fairy Godmother, she turns back the clock and enchants the glass slipper to fit the foot of her own daughter, Anastasia.  Another flick of the wand ensures that the Prince has no memory of even meeting Cinderella at the ball...

With only Cinderella herself aware of the hideous plot against her, she must find a way to reverse the evil spell before the fairytale ends in the Prince's wedding to the wrong girl.  Fans of the original ""Cinderella"" (available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinderella-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0007Z9R7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinderella (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>) will find themselves grippped, moved, and perhaps even brought to the verge of tears as the characters play out this fascinating story premise.

This attempt to bring to life the characters of Disney's ""Cinderella"" in an alternate reality is a very clever one.  The first sequel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinderella-II-Dreams-Come-True/dp/B00005T7H7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinderella II - Dreams Come True</a>) was a largely hit-and-miss affair, but things return to excellent form here.  There are several lovely songs, including ""Perfectly Perfect"", ""More Than a Dream"", ""At the Ball"", and ""I Still Believe"".

The same voice cast from ""Dreams Come True"" has been recruited (Jennifer Hale as Cinderella, Christopher Daniel Barnes as the Prince, Susanne Blakeslee as Lady Tremaine, Tress MacNeille as Anastasia, Russi Taylor as both Fairy Godmother and Drizella), and they all stay true to the overall mood and feeling from the first movie's voice talents.

DVD extras include a music video (""I Still Believe"") performed by ""Heroes""' Hayden Panettiere; plus a fun DVD-ROM component called ""Cinderella's Ballroom"", where you can choreograph your own ballroom routines, listen to music via the Princess Jukebox, and more.",1174694400,11,2309,6.117647058823529

2667631,4,B000JBWWRO,"I liked this quite alot for 2 major reasons;

1 Cinderella  is willing to think for herself and on her feet.  Not just  wait for somebody else to come along and save her.  She thought out plans,  used her wits and yet did not stoop to be cruel to her sister.

2. We really get to see Anastacia  rise above being a rather spoiled  self centered person  that she was raised to be,  She really did want love, not really revenge.

BTW rather than other disney sequels (such as fox and the hound 2) this was rather congluent to the original movie.  It fit nicely without any major chinks getting in the way.",1174521600,2,602,4.221238938053097

Even so, this film bests their last direct-to-video installment, Cinderella 2, which I turned off after just ten minutes.  This movie makes you yearn for the original film and the magic that went into it.  It does have its high points, though, in that I love seeing the stepsister characters developed.  Maybe a better direct-to-DVD offering would simply be a stepsister biography?  Anyway, some of the characters actions do not ring true.  And a time-travel theme?  That might be better suited for a Star Trek movie.  However, that was the gimmick that got me to buy this film in the first place!  Maybe the next sequel will be Cinderella 4:  Back 4 More, Race Against the Machines.

2667635,2,B000JBWWRO,"I miss the days of Disney classics with good storytelling and good themes. Unfortunately, Disney hasn't told a good animated story since Tarzan. Pixar does it well, but Disney insists on recycling their old classics in the way of straight to DVD movies. Cinderella III is just another sophomoric recycling of a Disney classic. The plot was unbelievable and silly (how could the Fairy Godmother be so careless?), the characters sound like every other animated character, the songs were generic Broadway and all sound the same, and why do the stepsisters have such beautiful singing voices? In the original Cinderella, they couldn't carry a tune to save their lives. Did their tone-deafness all of a sudden disappear? If you have children, this may amuse them, although this no where near captures the spirit of the original. The quality of this is no greater than a Saturday morning cartoon.",1174176000,5,890,5.02027027027027

2667637,3,B000JBWWRO,"My 4 year old daughter loves anything princess and therefore loved this movie with its ""happily ever after"" ending.  As an adult, I was disappointed.  Since I have never seen the second movie I don't know if the sister Anastasia changed, but she was different in this movie.  How does someone so spoiled and mean become the character she is in III?  Also, the king is no longer interested in grandchildren, but true love, which is not part of his character in the original.  I guess what I am saying is that the characters don't seem to line up with the original characters.  I will say there are some redeeming things about this movie; namely that Cinderella is more independent and resourceful here.",1173916800,3,701,4.658536585365853
2667638,3,B000JBWWRO,"Well, the box claims it's got more magic, wonder, and suspense than the original, but we know right off the bat there's no way that could ever possibly be the case; no Disney sequel even matches its predecessor (some come a lot closer than others though). But like Cinderella II, this one is semi-enjoyable, semi-worthwhile, and not a total atrocity. It is, of course, better than Cinderella II, which was essentially a string of fairly silly short stories. There are a few ways, though, in which I felt II was superior to III.

Now to put a time frame on III (or Twist, as I'll call it) understand that it starts out a year after Cinderella has married the Prince. Lady Tremaine magically rewinds time to the moment when the Grand Duke shows up with the glass slipper in the first film. Thus the first segment of II, starting right after Cinderella's honeymoon, has already happened in the beginning of Twist, but time is then rewound; the third segment with Anastasia and the Baker happens entirely after Twist; and the second segment, which was the stupid little story about the mice, is completely irrelevant. Got that?

It becomes pretty clear, really. So in Twist, they have built on the second one instead of ignoring it, as I had expected them to do. But no Beatrice, Daphne, or Countess show up. At least, Twist has an original plot, and isn't another feeble attempt at continuing a story. With the exception of the song by Jacques and Gus, and the one at the end, the music in Twist is lame. The whole movie still has that ""I'm not even going to try to live up to my original"" sequel feel. The animation, while it looks good overall, is actually horrible upon close inspection--so horrible, in fact, that it's absolutely hilarious. I mean, usually I have to slow down and pause the movie to see all the hysterically funny individual frames of the characters, but in this one, I saw amazingly exaggerated, hideous, hilarious things go right by on the screen, though we were obviously not supposed to notice.

A lot of depth is added to certain characters in Twist; we meet the King's much taller Queen (albeit in paintings), and discover a truly romantic side to the goofy, roly-poly, easily excited and irritated King. The Prince, instead of being a personality-free, rhino-hating, long-eyelashed nobody like he was in II, is now a really nice, humble, long-eyelashed main character with a really modern and less formal attitude. It's a bit ridiculous, but so is everything else and it makes for some great lines and expressions.
What depth there is in this film--and there's a little more than in II--comes mostly at the part where Cinderella's walking aboard the ship to be banished. It's pretty sad. I guess. Cindy also ends up having to be kind of tough, escape danger, protect Anastasia from a spell aimed at her by her own mother, and foil the diabolical plans of Lady Tremaine involving Anastasia as a `Twinderella.'

I felt as if they were combining elements from other Disney films, like Tarzan, Beauty & the Beast, The Lion King, and The Little Mermaid. I mean, when the King was showing Stacy the Kingdom I expected him to warn her against going to the elephant graveyard.
Since we know Stacy's going to find true love with a baker, we can see why she's portrayed sympathetically from the start; this whole thing is a prelude to the baker thing, readying her. Drizella spends the movie making wisecracks and it seems that she's too greedy and attached to her mum to take the step towards redemption that Stacy has, but she's fully capable of it.
It's a bit disturbing to hear Lady Tremaine say ""Bibbidi bobbidi boo"" so much, but she does, and Stacy lets her talk her into all kinds of trickery before getting her lesson about true love (that it's the most powerful kind of magic there is, that her mom doesn't get it, bla bla.) She finds out she wants true love, but she's not going to get it from the Prince, and she winds up refusing to split him up with Cindy. And as the King tells her, ""Everyone deserves true love."" Yes indeed. And as the portrait during the credits shows, she's going to find that baker some day.

And her mom's still not going to be happy.
The humorous parts: Well, as always the Grand Duke and King are outrageously funny. Now, the Prince is pretty funny himself. Lucifer is seen in human form, Drizella is a repulsive pig (in more than one way--watch her face when Tremaine brushes her hair, please) and Stacy is the worst dancer in the world. When Princey is charging to recover Cindy on horseback, I predicted that he was going to swim after the ship. But no. He was thrown from the horse and I predicted he was going to swim, involuntarily. But no. He amazingly landed on the ship anyway and swung around like a bloody pirate. Okay.
The movie's most important lesson is this: you can tell if it's true love by the feeling you get when you touch someone's hand. I didn't know whether to find the whole hand thing cute or silly.

OK, the one thing that angered me about Twist was the one character I really liked from the second one, the one I thought saved it and made it any good. I was, admittedly, pleasantly shocked to see that she'd made it into this movie at all. But Holland Taylor's voice talent was pretty much wasted and it's almost as if they shouldn't have included Prudence at all. I mean, she is drawn completely differently and looks incredibly weird now. Her eyes are no longer green. She disappears before the movie is half over, and doesn't interact with anyone but Cindy. She had basically no purpose and was nowhere near as cool as in the second one. I can only say it was neat to see her in the castle before the time of the second movie. Additionally she revealed that she's supervised for 30 years, offering a clue to how old she is. But anyway, the best couple by far in Dreams Come True was her and the Grand Duke. I didn't expect any more character development in Twist, after all, it's before the point where she dances with him and we see that she's not exactly as she appears to be. It's just that..I don't know, I wanted something more than the absurd scenes they gave her. It's no coincidence that the King threw her onto the Grand Duke at the royal banquet, in that segment it's pretty obvious in the beginning that he and Prudence like each other and do a bit of flirting. I thought we'd at least see them together in one of the portraits at the end, as a case of 'true love.' I certainly didn't expect them to be married and having kids or anything because again, this is before they actually hooked up. But, still...I felt Prue was dreadfully underutilized and didn't meet her potential.

Except for the shameful things like that, Twist was worth a watch or two.",1173744000,,6747,4.548148148148148
2667639,4,B000JBWWRO,"I found this movie to be an interesting counterpart to the original - which I loved as a child and still as an adult.  I found the story line interesting - Cinderella didn't rely on or even think about contacting the Fairy God Mother to get her out of the situation.  With the help of her friends (granted they were mice & birds) she figured out how to resolve 'the problem' presented to her via her step-mother.  The movie plants a good seed that we females should not rely on 'others' (i.e. the knight in shinning armor or the prince) to save us --- we need to be able to save ourselves for ourselves - that we have the inner strength to do so at our disposal.  Doing so, we become a stronger person and more of a partner to the male we choose to love when we become adults.",1173744000,5,776,4.153333333333333

While it told the same ole love conquers all story; I appreciated the fact that it involved one of the sisters and made her out not to be so bad afterall.  I always thought that perhaps someone should re-write the story and make the sisters not so evil.  Just people looking for love as Cinderella was.  This story ""almost"" does that.  Perhaps leaving room for another tale after this one that would have a love interest for the sister.  A funny tale rather than the typical ""romance"" story.

The music ofcourse isn't as good as the original; but in these follow-up movies they seldom are.  Cinderella also appears more intelligent and more capable of making decisions on her own and handling the situation with inginuity.

2667653,5,B000JBWWRO,"It's not often that one can rave about a direct-to-video DVD release, not even a Disney one. In fact, a large number of fans absolutely detest them, especially when they are sequels, and even more-so when they are sequels to classics. Yet, Disney proved excellence in direct-to-video was possible with such a film once before with ""Bambi 2,"" and now, they've done it again with the highly enjoyable ""Cinderella 3: A Twist in Time!""

""Cinderella 3"" picks up one year after Cinderella and the prince were married. In fact, it opens as they are making their way to an intimate, outdoor anniversary party being thrown for them by the Fairy Godmother and Cinderella's animal friends. Admittedly, this opening to the film makes the viewer wary. It is extremely happy, giggly, sweet, and direct-to-video corny, in true Disney Princess merchandising machine tradition, to the point of being nauseating, and inflated by the fact that this Cinderella sequel is a Disney Renaissance style musical (like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""). But, fear not, the overly happy and sweet opening is there with a purpose, for only moments later will Cinderella's perfect life be stolen away from her by her wicked stepmother and selfish stepsisters. See, the less evil of Cinderella's step-siblings, Anastasia (she was established as the less evil one in Cinderella 2, and that is carried over here), has noticed the perfect pair riding across the countryside to their anniversary party, and her curiosity and desire for a romance of her own persuade her to follow. When she witnesses the Fairy Godmother working her magic for Cinderella and her prince, she realizes that this was how the two came to find each other. Wanting a love of her own, Anastasia swipes Fairy Godmother's magic wand when no one is looking and quickly takes it home to her mother and sister. After suffering for a full year from having to take care of themselves for a change, Lady Tremaine and her daughters are eager for some revenge on their former housemate. Using the magic wand, Tremaine casts a spell to turn back time and ""unravel Cinderella's happily ever after!"" This time, the baddies use magic to fix it so that the slipper fits Anastasia before Cinderella makes it down from the tower. The Tremaines are whisked off to the palace, and Cinderella is left behind with orders from her stepmother to keep away from the prince and his home. Cinderella fears all is lost, but her friends Jaq and Gus remind her that the prince should know the difference between her and Anastasia. They plot to get Cindy into the castle under the guise of royal mouse catcher, but while the prince initially does know the difference, causing a funny and awkward moment with the Tremaines, he is soon put under a spell to believe Anastasia really was the girl he had danced with at the ball. The odds are stacked against Cinderella, and an adversary with a magic wand is not easy to beat, but Cinderella keeps faith that she doesn't need magic to make her dreams of true love and happiness come true.

""Cinderella 3: A Twist in Time"" is an exciting, emotional, magical, and even action-packed movie that is a worthy sequel to the classic Disney film. Being the final film from Disney's Australian animation house, the artists and filmmakers have put their all into this one, and it shows. If only this much effort had been put into all of Disney's other direct-to-video releases! Sure, there are a few things one can complain about, and I have to keep Bambi 2 a notch higher than Cinderella 3 due to the fact that Bambi 2 was nearly flawless, but both films would have easily been at home on the big screen (and were far more worthy of such a release than Jungle Book 2 or even Return to Neverland). No, I won't say Cinderella 3 surpasses the original Cinderella either, but a sequel doesn't really have to top the original, it just needs to be loyal to the first and have its own interesting and well executed story. Cinderella 3 has this, and despite a couple of minor quibbles, is still worthy of a 5 star ranking. Unlike the much maligned ""Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True,"" the art, voice work, and animation in ""Cinderella 3: A Twist in Time"" are superbly done to match the classic as much as possible. One only misses Mary Blair's artistic touch. Cinderella is as gorgeous as ever, and seeing her have a couple of action scenes this time around makes her all the more attractive. She's voiced beautifully as well (by accomplished voice actress Jennifer Hale, who I can't believe is the same actress that voiced her in Cindy 2). The songs aren't that memorable, aside from one that Jaq and Gus sing, but they are better than your standard direct-to-video fare. It might take a few viewings to get used to Cinderella and Anastasia bursting into song like Belle, but this actually doesn't happen that often. It's also a little awkward that C.D. Barnes, well known as the voice of Ariel's Prince Eric in the original Little Mermaid film, is the voice of the prince here. However, one has to commend him and the filmmakers for actually developing the prince's character and making him into an admirable Disney hero. The same needs to be done for Snow White's prince, though I'm sure a Snow White sequel would put a lot of people up in arms. I know John Lasseter has currently said there will be no more Disney direct-to-video sequels, but I don't buy it, and I say, if they'd just keep making 'em like this, I'd be fine with them.

The most reasonable complaint about ""Cinderella 3"" is the continuity issue the ending brings about. I don't want to give the ending away, but what is troubling about it is that the events of this film sort of ""erase"" the ending of the original film, and things aren't put right when it is all over. That can be a little upsetting for the loyal Disney/Cinderella fan. We can only hope that the Fairy Godmother filled Cinderella and the Prince in on all that transpired before, later on. Some might be disappointed not to see Bruno the dog in this one, and I'm not sure if the horse during the action scene in this film is supposed to be Cinderella's old horse or not, but fans of ""Cinderella 2"" might be happy to see the character of Prudence return. For those who haven't seen ""Cinderella 2"" and just plain don't want to, not to worry, you don't have to have seen it to see and understand ""Cinderella 3."" In fact, I'm still trying to figure out when ""Cinderella 2"" is supposed to have taken place. It really doesn't seem to fit at all now. It couldn't have happened before ""Cinderella 3,"" because at the beginning of Cindy 3, Anastasia is wishing she could find true love too (something she found in ""Cinderella 2""). It couldn't have happened after ""Cinderella 3,"" because of the situation of the Tremaine family and Anastasia's initial attitude towards Cinderella in Cindy 2. It seems a ""Cinderella 3"" viewer would have to disregard ""Cinderella 2"" altogether, though the filmmakers of ""Cinderella 3"" did not do so completely. As I said, Prudence is brought back, and at the end of the film we see reassurance of Anastasia's future romance with the village baker. Besides, the important thing to note is that ""Cinderella 3"" succeeds in nearly every way that ""Cinderella 2"" failed us, and many folks would like to forget ""Cinderella 2"" ever happened anyway.

On to the DVD. The picture is beautiful, of course, and presented in anamorphic widescreen format. As one has come to expect from Disney DTV sequels, this one is pretty light on bonus features. On the bright side, two are actually worthwhile. One of those is a music video for an original song called, ""I Still Believe."" It might not be that great to the average viewer, but if you're a Hayden Panettiere fan, star of the NBC hit superhero show ""Heroes,"" you've got a winner there, as she provides the singing. I'm a huge ""Heroes"" fan myself. The video has three footage aspects: clips from the film, footage of Hayden walking down a black and white street that turns into color as she passes, and footage of her looking absolutely enchanting in a magical field of giant flowers. Personally, I think it would have been better without the seemingly out of place bits of her walking down the street and turning it color.  The other worthwhile bonus feature is a featurette on the making of ""Twice Charmed,"" a Cinderella-based musical stage show created for the Disney Cruise Line that, like ""A Twist in Time,"" has a twist of its own on the story. It's not only very interesting, but it works effectively as an advertisement, which, of course, is what it really is. The other extras include the Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Choose game, which gets old fast, the Cinderella Ball Room DVD-ROM activity, but I never bother with those, and a sneak peek at the upcoming DVD, ""Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: A Kingdom of Kindness."" That last one is actually interesting too, if you're a fanatic of Disney animation or Disney princesses, or whatever. If you're picky, you may opt not to get the Kingdom of Kindness DVD after seeing the preview, or maybe just the opposite. It depends just how far from the original films you allow Disney animation to get for direct to video releases. Realizing that the new Sleeping Beauty cartoon previewed in this sneak peek is just a TV-style animated short, I'm not going to rant about it not looking like a feature film. I'll be buying it to enjoy the first new Aurora animated story since 1959, even if its only aim is to please little girls.

And, that's pretty much the ""Cinderella 3: A Twist in Time"" DVD in a nutshell. It's a fantastic sequel to an animated classic and belongs on the DVD shelf of every Disney animation fanatic! Grit your teeth through the opening scene, then sit back for a wonderful experience. You'll probably get multiple plays out of this one on the first day!",1173312000,3,9854,4.693063583815029

Disney did an excellent job with the story, but for children younger than say, 7 or 8, parents may need to explain things along the way.  But it's a good introduction to ""time travel"" for little minds.

That said, I was amazed when the original ""slipper"" sequences were re-animated for this to include the changes! After having seen Cinderella nearly 100 times (not kidding!), it was odd seeing the sequence play out differently.  I almost suspect that Disney did this story as an inside joke for all of us parents who have had to watch the original Cinderella countless times.

The animation is great -- the plot is enjoyable. They even add some depth to the characters of the Prince and King. Even Anastasia and Drizella become somewhat more real and likeable...if that's possible.

I'm not sure it has a lot of replay value -- surely not as much as the original Cinderalla.  My daughter doesn't ask to watch it, but if prompted with this as a choice, she sometimes selects it.  Overall, it's enjoyable -- watch it together!",1173052800,3,1189,4.601895734597156

The best part is when the step mother uses magic to trap Cinderella inside a pumpkin, and not that fancy coach this was inside with he seeds and thorns grew all around it and Cinderella's dress was all ripped. Haha and Cinderella is so silly when she goes ""But I danced  with the prince"" and the stepmother just laughs at her!

Is she outside of time, and so remains a statue while everything is happening in the past? I don't mean to over-analyze this movie - obviously, I am not part of Disney's target audience, but it seems to me to be a huge flaw to the plot.",1171670400,,445,4.126436781609195
2667673,4,B000JBWWRO,"I watched Cinderlla 3 last night.  There was a lot of hype surrounding the film, but I thought it was pretty good.

The first Cinderella - the timeless classic - attracts audiences of all ages.  As we already know, the story is perfect and has the ultimate culmination: ""...But I have the other slipper...""

The second Cinderella is just three mini-stories woven together to make an hour and a half movie.  The stories are best suited for children under age 9.  (These are the kinds of featurettes that would appear on a Saturday morning cartoon series, for example - the plots are simple, the dialogue is pretty cheesy, and nothing is really accomplished at the end.)

Cinderella 3 obviously does not compare to the classic first, but in all truth, it is a legitimate film that will extract all the emotions you had pulled from the first film.  On that topic, however, the level of ""emotion pulling"" has changed, probably in an attempt to keep the movie viable in today's market.

For one, the wicked step-mother is now about ten times more wicked.  The first movie played her as a cold antagonist with a more slithery approach to her wickedness.  In Cinderella 3, that same step-mom now conducts open acts of evil (and only a few slithery actions).

Why is that important?  Because an overwhelmingly evil step-mother dwarfs the emotion of feeling sorry for Cinderella.  In the classic film, one could not help but feel so terrible for poor Cinderella as she worked so hard and was not rewarded.

Now, Cinderella is punished for being nice.  This changes the whole concept of the ""Cinderella Story.""  Now you just want that old haggard step-mom to get drug from the back of a horse-drawn pumpkin carriage - you could care less if Cinderella won the prince back or lived happily ever after.  That is, the irony that is bound to happen (good defeats evil in a Disney film) is not as spectacularly fantastic as the classic film when Cinderella produces the second, missing slipper.  The irony of Cinderella 3 is that the step-mom merely gets her comeuppance.

But this movie also plays on the personality and feelings of Anastasia, which I generally find kind of weird.  It separates her from Drizzella which to me is awkward.  I appreciated the dueling sisters who only acted in concert to harm Cinderella's interests.  Now the movie pulls out the possible good in one of the three main antagonists.

Cinderella 2 explored this the most, however, but I thought it was brutally done.  Basically, Anastasia is a ""good trapped inside"" dumb-dumb, as one would be left to think.  Anastasia basically wants things but doesn't know how to get them, but somehow manages in the end, usually from revelation or help from Cinderella.

Sure, that makes Cinderella seem even more like the saint that she is for helping her sister (who apparently still hates Cinderella, even when she helps).  But it draws so much focus away from our one true star: the lady who went from rags to riches and defined a brand new storyline for others to coin or imitate.

To give Cinderella 3 a side credit, albeit minor, is that it ""follows the rules.""  Namely, the rules regarding ""bippity boppity boo,"" magic, and the animals and their interactions.  The talking mice, the effects of the magic on the animals, and the history of each character (including whatever may have been grotesquely altered in Cinderella 2 with Lucifer falling in love, Anastasia desiring and finding love, or Cinderella being conflicted with her new title in royalty) made amends for Cinderella 2's near-fatal depictions.

That was a hard challenge, but these Disney movie-makers got it right in Cinderella 3.

To close, Cinderella 3 is best suited for children age 12 or under per my review.  It will not reach out to the hearts of ad ults like the original classic did, and it won't draw the emotions you'd expect from the classic Cinderella Story that Disney founded back in the day.

Due to its simple storyline and re-focus of characters' significance and portrayals in the film, I can only recommend this film if your child actually liked (or was entertained by) Cinderella 2, or if he/she really still loves the characters since his/her last viewing of the original Cinderella.

Don't expect much from Cinderella 3 (especially its replay value) so that when you do watch it, you won't be disappointed when you compare it to the monumental classic.",1171497600,8,4399,4.810918774966711
2667674,5,B000JBWWRO,"I was surprised that my wife bought this DVD for our kids, because Disney direct-to-DVD sequels are usually poorly animated, poorly written flops. I was surprised again when I happened to come into my kids' room while they were watching it, and I found myself getting pulled into the film and watching the rest of it with them. I vaguely remember seeing part of Cinderella II, enough to recall that it was rather poor.

It seems that some reviewers here will hate the film no matter what, because they are Disney purists and feel that no sequel could ever possibly do justice to the original. And then it seems that other reviewers want to love the film so much that they will rate it highly even if they movie is a stinker.

I have neither of these mindsets. I don't have any deep devotion to original Disney features, and I don't really care about the sequels. What I can say is that this movie has very good animation. I had to keep reminding myself that this was a direct-to-DVD production, because it looked so good. As for picky details like what Cinderella's foot looked like, I guess I've got too much of a life to keep replaying the movie over and over to focus on things like that. As alluded to above, the story was good enough to pull me in when I had other things to do. In fact, I agree with some other reviewers that Cindrella and the prince were both more engaging characters in this movie than in the original. The only characters in the original that were really entertaining were the stepmother/stepsisters, the king and duke, and the animals. The star couple were rather boring to watch, but not so in this sequel.

I gave this 5 stars not because it is worthy of any awards, but rather because among other direct-to-DVD releases (especially sequels), it really stands out.",1171324800,114,1793,4.544891640866873
2667675,3,B000JBWWRO,"When I first heard that Disney was making a third Cinderella, I was a bit leary. I'd already purchased and watched the second one and was very disappointed. HOwever, once I heard the premise of the third Cinderella, I was intrigued and interested. So, once it came out, I purchased it.

I will say, it is better than the second Cinderella only in that it tells an actual story and isn't a collection of short episods. Of course, it isn't as good as the orginial. I liked the story idea and the animation is actually quite good for a Disney straight to video but sadly, as the sequels tend to do, the characters where kind of ruined. For some reason, the sequels feel the need to take serious characters and turn them into goofballs! I highly doubt Prince Charming would leap out the palace window just because his father told him he could not go down the stairs! And I really don't think Cinderella would blatently disobey the rules. She would not confront the Prince alone and practically force him to remember who she is! For starters, even without the spell cast on him, it is quite understandable for the Prince not to remember Cinderella. She was dressed up in a very fancy gown and it was rather dark at the ball and now she's dressed in her rags and looks quite different from when she was at the ball. Of course, I know this is Disney, but still! Cinderella should not be so confused as to why he doesn't remember her! They'd only met that one time! Sadly, this sequel also gives Cinderella an attitude that she doesn't have in the original and that kind of took away from her whole sweet innocence. The mice,step-sisters and step-mother were still in character for the most part so that was nice.

I'm also rather curious as to why Anastasia is the step-sister who has the side stories? She found a love in the second Cinderella (and where did that baker go in this third one? After all, the second Cinderella took place right after Cinderella and the Prince married while the third one takes place about a year later). The Baker shows up in a picture during the credits so he's obviously still a romantic interest, but still, why does Anastasia get to be the one to ""marry"" the prince when she should already be in love with the baker?

Now after reading this review, you're probably thinking if there was anything good about it. Well, as mentioned before the story line itself is cute, though a little too close to the scene in the Little Mermaid (and on a side note, Prince Charming is voiced by the same guy who voiced Prince Eric from Little Mermaid). I will say, my favorite scene was when the mice are trying to convince Prince Charming that he's in love with Cinderella and he thinks he's going nuts because birds and mice are talking attacking him. My favorite line has to do with Prince Charming telling his father that ""the mice told him he was in love with someone else"" and that he had to go get her but not to worry he'll be back in time for the wedding. The king then tells him that it's not the wedding he's worried about, it's the talking mice! I laughed quite at that, and I'm even giggling right now! I have to say, there were several silly bits and it was kind of refreshing to see Cinderella looking like she'd been rung through the ringer near the end. Not that I have anything against her, it's just nice to see her not looking so fresh all the time. I think she probably even looked her age when she was about to go on the ship near the end because her hair was down (not tied back) and since she's probably between 18-20, she looked that old during that scene.

So, for children, this is a very good movie because of the silliness, but it's just not the same as the original so don't expect it to be.",1171238400,3,3734,4.391618497109826
2667676,3,B000JBWWRO,"Disney movies in general are just better than everyone else's, but not so for sequels.  Disney sequels are famously bad, with mediocre music and iffy plot.  Bad enough to make one wonder: did they just throw this together to prey on the pockets of parents with little girls?

Because, really, little girls are the only ones who won't notice the gaping plot holes or massive inferiority of this to the original.  What really gets me is that on every new, fresh Disney movie, you can tell how much time and effort went into it.  But sequels just seem to be an attempt to ride the success of the first movie, and this is no different.

That said, I forced my husband to watch this because it was, indeed, an interesting plotline.  It reminded me of a whole lot of anime fanfiction I've read -- cool but used idea, never quite lives up to expectations, but you kind of have to finish it anyway.

I maintain that the movie is watchable and probably very nice for kids, despite my husband's protests of ""The fairy godmother just THREW her wand, and then she was a useless doddering old lady.  Not magical at all.  What kind of fairy godmother just THROWS her wand?!""

But what bothered ME most was the music -- I could deal with the ""Perfectly Perfect"" song at first, but then I realized that the songwriter didn't bother to come up with any other lyrics.  The same songs were repeated over and over again, and not with the nice, thematic style that Pocahontas has -- they were actually just the same songs altered a WEE bit to fit the situation.  Meaning either the notes or the words, but never both.

And is anyone else bothered by the fact that the prince doesn't seem to have a name?  Or that the wicked stepmother keeps saying ""Bippity Boppity Boo"" in the most incongruous use of language since the last time President Bush spoke in public?

I watched it.  I enjoyed parts, like how the prince had a personality or how Cinderella was willing to fight to get her man.  But it's not the Cinderella of Walt Disney's day.  Walt wouldn't have allowed this to be put on the market like it is.  He had standards.",1171238400,3,2105,4.446475195822455

No mere action heroine, Cindy III uses her brains to figure out how to outwit the villains, but doesn't shrink from handing out some well-deserved Princess pay back (wait til you see the runaway pumpkin coach scene!) The action climax(s) will have everyone cheering.

2667695,3,B000JBWWRO,"I am speaking as a true Disney movie fan. I love them all. I am a grown up man (over the age of 18). I saw this movie by myself, even though the Internet Movie Database had bad reviews. Here is what the movie is about:

Cinderella's stepmother gets the wand from Anastasia, who got it when it slipped out of the Fairy Godmother's hands. She learned the magic words, ""Bippity Boppity Boo."" Anastasia's mother, Cinderella's evil and selfish Stepmother, pocketed the wand after turning back time so that she may have Anastasia be the one to live the ""Happily Ever After"" life with the Prince in place of Cinderella.

Now I now that this is a Disney movie, but Cinderella is really put to the test here. At one point, she even has to face death itself. Is true love worth facing death? What does Lucifer the Cat look like when he is human? Where is the Fairy Godmother during all this? Will the Prince ever find his true love, or is his true love now Anastasia? Sorry, I will say no more here. Have to watch the movie to find out. Oh, and if you enjoy this movie, than look forward to ""The Little Mermaid III,"" coming in November of 2007.

2667696,3,B000JBWWRO,"I actually liked this sequel better after a couple of viewings.  It did not really grab me the first time around, and my wife thought that it relied too much on slapstick (like the silly food fight). Some of the songs are pretty good but, overall, it is not on the same level as movies like Brother Bear.

Now for the reaction of the audience that really counts in our household: our three-year old likes it a lot; the two-year old was so-so on Cinderella III at first, but now, like me, she enjoys it as well.

The story line is adequately described elsewhere, so I see no need to repeat it, nor do I see the need to explain how I think it could have been done better. (But if you want to see an excellent non-animated version of the Cinderella story, check out ""Ever After - A Cinderella Story"" with Drew Barrymore. In ""Ever After"" you get an even deeper sense of the great injustice done to Cinderella by the evil stepmom.)

Perhaps Cinderella III merits 4 stars for its entertainment value and, while that is basically all that these movies are about--entertainment, I just didn't think it was quite 4 stars, and I reserve 5 stars for movies, even animated ones, that also contain a meaningful message. Sure, Cinderella has a little more spunk in this sequel, but all she is fighting for is to get married to her true love (someone who she actually knows very little about). She is not fighting for any moral principle that I would like my daughters to recognize and repect.

[Added notes: (1) While I fully respect their opinion, I disagree rather strongly with those reviewers who see Cinderella in the original version as a placid character who generates little emotional interest for the viewer. Think about her situation: after her father's death, she was made a servant in her own home(!) and she is completely under the control of the evil stepmom. To whom could she turn for help? No one.  And yet, she faced each day with spirit and renewed hope, and she responded with emotions appropriate to the abuse that was heaped upon her. Again, if you do not know children who have had to endure abusive home environments, count yourself lucky and just watch ""Cinderella - Ever After"" to get a glimpse at what life must have been like for Cinderella.

2) All of these movie reviews are simply someone's opinion, and I find them all helpful. Whether the reviewer says ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"", the comments give me a feel for the movie. From the high number of ""not helpful's"" given to a lot of the reviews that rate Cinderella III and similar movies less than stellar, I am left to wonder if the raters are simply expressing their disagreement with the review's opinion.]",1170892800,2,2680,4.570833333333334

Don't you ever get tired of the good guys always winning or there always being a good ending. That gets very dull over time. And I don't really think this movie was really Imoral. Getting married twice is not wrong, a lot of people get remarried. When everything gets erased you must start over again.

2667698,3,B000JBWWRO,"Cinderella III was surprisingly okay.  I would say I would watch it again and I am not upset about purchasing it.  I just need to remember it is a ""straight to DVD"" movie.  If you can get past the bad casting they did for the voices of the characters, except for Jaq and Gus, and the cheaper quality in animation, then this movie isn't all bad.

The story line is okay, but what I do hate is that they erase the original's ending.  In the original movie Cinderella gets locked in her room, the mice free her, and after that we all know what happens.

In this movie, it picks up the story from that point.  Every thing that happens after the mice free Cinderella from her room is now what really happens because the fairy Godmother decides that this ending is better.  She decides to erase 1 year of Cinderella's and the Prince's marriage, the glass slipper fitting only Cinderella, and everything else that we saw in the first movie's ending.  That is what I didn't like.

The fairy godmother could have just waved her wand and taken everyone back to the time and place before Anastasia got her hands on the magic wand, but she doesn't.  This, and the terrible songs and voices, is why I give this movie only 3 stars.  Disney could of tried a little harder to get the right voices for the characters. Of course they can't get the original actors, but I'm sure there are closer matches out there to the original voices than what they've got going on in this movie. (With the exception of the mice.  They were pretty close to the original voices.)The step sister voices and fairy godmother voices are extremely horrible.

What I do like about this movie, is that you get a bigger sense of the love that our 2 main characters share, and know that it is more than just a crush.  You see both Cinderella and the Prince fight for their love, instead of just falling in love because a fairy godmother helped Cinderella get to the ball.

So would I recommend someone adding this to their collection, in my case I'm glad I have it, but if what I mentioned above disturbs you, then maybe you should just rent it first if you are still curious.",1170892800,3,2133,4.403061224489796

2667700,4,B000JBWWRO,"I love fairy tales in all forms, and I really did like Cinderella II. I was a bit worried about Cinderella III because my first impression is that Disney was just out to make more money. As I learned the premise for the movie, ""What if the fairy godmother had become incapacitated and the stepmother had the wand?"" and it made me stop and say, ""Okay, I have to see that movie."" Disney developed the plot quite nicely. Everytime Cinderella triumphed, the stepmother would one up her and I'd still be waiting for my happy ending. I liked the anticipation. Also, as many other readers have said, Cinderella has guts in this movie. She stands up to the stepmother and tells her ""Hey lady quit raining on my parade!"" This movie was a great sequel. It seemed to stem from a provacative idea rather than Disney being out to disappoint us with a sub-par sequel (i.e. The Jungle Book 2).

The songs were short but very sweet, and I instantly fell in love with all of them. The soundtrack is amazing and very much like the original. The movie created the same magical, romantic feeling that so many people felt while watching the original. All in all this was an amazing movie, and don't let anybody tell you otherwise.

And by the way Cinderella 3 is set one year after the wedding, when Cinderella 2 took place after. There was refrence to Anastasia finding true love with the baker during the end credits as a way of conecting the two sequls.",1170806400,5,844,4.552631578947368
2667720,4,B000JBWWRO,"I know that's heresy, but I don't care. The original ""Cinderella"" may be a classic, but I never cared for it. I acknowledge the beauty of the animation and the quality of the songs, but I find it nearly impossible to root for the frustratingly passive title character.

Which is why I like this sequel. Cinderella finally comes into her own as a smart, resourceful heroine. She takes her fate into her own hands, and stands up to her evil stepmother instead of allowing the old rhymes-with-witch to bully her. This is the Cinderella I've always wanted to see!

While many have grumbled over the transformation of Cinderella's stepsister Anastasia, I liked it. I found it believable and quite touching. While her sister Drizella remains hateful, Anastasia shows that, underneath it all, she's really a decent person, who wishes to be loved for her own self, however clumsy and goofy that self may be.",1170806400,6,899,4.8311688311688314

I hate to be the one to point this out, but we are no longer in the 50's decade.  Animation has come a long way since then, so of course it will look sharper.  From an artist's standpoint, there is such subtly and depth to each scene that, storyline aside, it is delightful to watch - especially character reactions.  As for the story, it is clean (which is a rarety in and of itself) as well as entertaining.  The plot takes a fun twist on what would happen if the wand was in another's hand and really tries to prove that even without magical assistance, Cinderella could still hold her own.  And wasn't that what the 50's version was attempting to point out as well?  I don't think this movie detracts from the original, but instead is a fun, relaxing form of entertainment.  However, to be fair, the only part I found irritating was the change in the mice's diction.  That is the only change that I find annoying enough to mention.  That aside, it is nice to see a woman fight for her dreams and get them - and a prince with a personality to boot!

  So I would recommend this movie to those who just want a clean, fun, and intelligent source of entertainment for themselves as well as their children.",1170806400,4,1333,4.409836065573771
2667722,1,B000JBWWRO,"***SPOILDERS***  below warning.

  It starts off with cinderella's feet which do not look the same as in the original movie, kind of disgusting in my opinion.

When she talks about herself, blah blah, it's just not cinderellish, she's full of herself !!!!!!!!!!

Prince does not look the same, his neck is too fat and it seems his skin tone changes it almost every scene.  Their speech is too ""modern"" and annoying, doesn't give it an authentic feel at all.

The step sisters are WAY TOO GOOFY, unrealistic, I mean they can hardly walk two steps without flopping over, too silly.

Anastasia is way too stupid and she's apologizing for every little thing she does, it just doesn't make any sense, in the first movie they were all equally rude, even as children they were selfish little brats and now she just looks like a big goof!

The step mother was always mean but here the part when she gets the wand is going overboard, it's like she's a villian or witch ... too much drama in that part ""calling on all the forces of the universe??!"" DUH.

Anastasia's foot is HUGE, and then she kisses it and jumps around the room, this is going overboard, a girl in that era would not act this way at ALLLLLLL!!

Cinderella's comments after her step mother left was just weird, and then that uncatchy song and running out into the field.  Very uncreative and dramatic, these tunes are all so similar in all the disney movies today and so annoying!!

At the palace:  How on earth did she get to the palace before the rest arrive???

The prince working out with his father in the ""PINK"" gym and you'd think he's a circus boy after perfoming those high rise stunts, never would have expected that from him.

The part when prince charming has to apologize to them sounds so cheap, he enters the room and it's like he doesn't notice the girl ISN""T CINDERELLA..  and how anastasia introduces herself as a jerkess then it turns into a bit of a circus after he proposes.  The whole ""spell thing"" is just like in the little mermaide.

If you look closely she puts the ring on the left hand then admires it and it's on her right hand.

Cinderella finally FINDS the prince:  It's like she's making a fool of herself, her little giggle and she sounds EXACTLY like the princess May from Mulan, terrible.

The head maid dragging cinderella away looks so degrading, the whole ""meeting"" was cheesy.

Now when the step mother and sisters are shown into the room with the large cake this scene is a absoloutely rediculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What a MESS when the king meets the bride-to-be who is in an aweful disgusting state.  Unbelievable!

Now Anastasia and the prince practice dancing, why on earth does she HAVE to wear her ""one"" glass slipper???

The step mother seems to have so much influence in the palance once she ""moves in""

When the king gives the queens shell to anastasia he sounds like an old indian chief or something, the voice  just didn't seem to fit the part.

""I dooooooooo"" practice by anastasia was TOO MUCH, and I wonder why she has such a nice singing voice, doesn't seem to go together, plus suddenly she can dance so gracefully.. remember the first movie when the two sisters practice singing "" sing sweet nightangales""  they sounded AWEFUL so what brought such a change?

So unrealistic.

Cinderella struggles to say the magic words once she has the wand in her hands, stupid!!!

Prince's reaction after hearing the true story from the mice was a little calm, you'd think he would have a bit of a more worried reaction and not take it so lightly.. he's a cross between Eric from little mermaid and Zoro ridding off on the horse.

Now cinderella is told to get on the shop, her shoes and feet while stepping up onto the ship look really fat and ugly.. totally aweful animation.

On the ship she looks like Jane Wendy's daughter from PeterPan. Her bangs are all frayed and she looks like 13 year old.

Now the prince rides off behind the ship and once he jumps onto the ship he's looking a lot like a Zoro, even his skin tone is darker if you compare it to when they show the dream of him and cinderella dancing at the ball.  Also whats with the hand palm thingy, looks like something from TARZAN!!  Notice cinderella's frayed bangs and hair, once she hugs and swings around with the prince her hair starts to turn back into perfect form.

Now things calm down a bit and you think its going to end... hold on to your seats, it's not OVER yet!

Cinderella is resting near the king once prince brings her back to the palance, notice in the first scene she has her hair nice and out, then when the servent comes to tell the king that they weren't able to find the step mother and sisters cinderella now has her hair tied back with a blue ribbon, then in the following scene her hair is back to being out without a ribbon, STUPID,  PAY attention to detail disney, HELLO.

What's with brides preparing themselves?  This scene reminds me of Mulan getting ready for her wedding with Mushu on top of the closet, really strange.

The pumpkin just had to be included in the movie somehow, honestly I find this scene where cinderella gets stuck inside quite scary and gross.

Ok she made her escape and if you pause the scene right when she's on the horse looking at the castle in the distance notice her foot, it's HUGE!  Even her hands look huge.  Disney, DETAILS !

Cinderella savagly ridding all the way to the palace while the wedding is ongoing, the priest looks like something from STAR WARS, freaky.

- Ok, cinderella appears, breaks up the ceremony, step mother is shouting at anastasia and once she starts using the magic it's like prince just steps in there using his sword to divert the magic away from cinderella, it looks so lame and his facial expressions are not heroic or anything.

Note cinderella's hairdo, it's tied up high in a bun, however when she was preparing for the wedding it was low behind her neck, kind of strange.

I didn't like the fairy's voice in the end, it sounded so squeaky.

Now after the credits and the little ""photos"" which show some really goofy ones once you reach the last one with the heart framed roses and cinderella and the prince in the middle notice their hands, I think they went just a bit too far with this!!!",1170806400,3,6255,4.512888888888889
2667723,1,B000JBWWRO,"It's hard to put into words how bad this movie really is.

Normally, I've never had any issues with Disney sequels, like some people do; in fact, I like them. I loved Cinderella II because it played with the idea of the `what happens after happily ever after'?  Cinderella II was entertaining, for me, and it didn't alter anything of the original story.  This movie however is a disaster; both of my girls were extremely disappointed by this movie.  Like someone else said it is an insult to the first movie and I would say the second one too.

It seemed that the producers, or writers, who made this movie couldn't think of any good story lines, and ended up only repeating the same thing over and over again.  Worst of all, it looks like they did not bother to do any story continuance with Cinderella II.  In that movie, Anastasia had already met someone she loved (the baker) and apparently she even had gone to the palace to dance with him.  In this story that starts in Cinderella's first wedding anniversary (which has the kids assuming that Anastasia's story already happened) we go back to Anastasia hating Cinderella and there is no mention of the baker.  Anastasia is looking for true love, but the problem is that if you follow the movie she was supposed to have found it already.  The producers annulled the first two movies so they could tell again a story that didn't need fixing.  Now it does need fixing, because annulling two wonderful movies so they can give us a mediocre sequel is quite an achievement.

The movie is so absolutely horrendous that even the songs are hard to listen too.  The movie has nothing good to entertaining you with, but has plenty to leave you fuming for hours if you are a Disney or Cinderella fan.  To make things worst, they deliver a mortal blow at the end of the movie when Cinderella and Prince Charming first year of marriage it's erased and they start all over again.  So Cinderella's first wedding never existed and we instead get that less than satisfying ending. What was that for? Are they planning another sequel?  I hope that this is not the case; because I'm going to stick this movie very far down in a closet and pretend it was never made.

2667727,4,B000JBWWRO,"The tale of Cinderella, with her kind beauty and rags-to-riches storybook ending, will stand the test of time as one of the most beloved children's stories. While Disney's attempt at ""Cinderella II"" was a nightmare, the new story put forth in ""Cinderella III: A Twist in Time"" is much more imaginative and satisfying for all.

Quick Synopsis: Cinderella has been married to her Prince Charming for almost a year, and has never been happier. Unfortunately, her evil step-mother and horrible step-sisters aren't so lucky. After Anastasia accidentally gets ahold of the Fairy Godmother's magic wand, Cinderella's step-mother uses it to turn back time and change the outcome of the tale! Instead of Cinderella's foot fitting the glass slipper, it is Anastasia who squeezes on the slipper and steals the Prince! Luckily, Cinderella has her trusty animal friends to help her set things right...but her wicked step-mother isn't going to make it easy...

This direct to DVD movie does a good job at creating an imaginative new story with such beloved characters. It even has beautiful new songs, and plenty of twists and turns in the plot. Just when you think everything is as it should be, and the story is about to get it's happy ending, Disney throws another wrench in the mix and keeps on going. While it's probably a good thing it went straight to DVD (it's not quite good enough for theatres), I think Disney-lovers will still find it an enjoyable film for the whole family.

There are a few fun special features available on the disc as well, including an interactive game wherein the viewer goes on a miniature scavenger hunt around the castle and tries to fix magical blunders created by that cranky cat, Lucifer, and those mischievious mice. There is also a CD-ROM for your home computer! These are mostly special features to entertain the children, but as Disney is always reminding us, you don't have to be a child to be young at heart.

Bottom line, it's a fun new story, and it's worth the addition to any Disney library.",1170633600,12,2027,4.8328530259366
2667748,3,B000JBWWRO,"No company anywhere in popular culture extends and stretches its intellectual properties like Walt Disney Pictures. Its beloved characters appear in film after sequel after straight-to-DVD after TV show after stage production, their stories told live and drawn from nearly every conceivable angle. This, plus the studio's diligent protection of its intellectual property, has led to the world seeing its folklore through Disney's lens. (Quick, think of Snow White, or Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, stories told for hundreds of years. Whose images do you see?)

If Disney doesn't retell its sequeled stories with quite the grandeur and reverence of Walt Disney's supervised originals (think ""Fantasia 2000,"" ""Jungle Book II""), it respects them enough to honor the original's spirits while approaching them from modern sensibility. So it is with ""Cinderella III: A Twist In Time,"" a pleasant, occasionally thought-provoking successor to Walt Disney's 1950 original.

This variation of the tale involves a stolen wand getting into the hands of Cinderella's evil stepmother, rewinding Cinderella's story to where her lost glass slipper didn't fit. The Prince, dashing and noble as in Disney movies for 70 years, could thus be misled and manipulated into marrying Cinderella's sister, Anastasia. While no classic Disney princess, Anastasia (voiced by Tress McNellie) provides the film's heart in her sentimental scenes with the king, and her song yearning for the love Cinderella had and their wicked stepmother (voiced by Susan Blakeslee in classic Disney villainess mode) seemed determined to steal for her.

Other favorites return from the original. Helpful mice Gus and Jaq sing the film's highlight song clueing the prince in on what happened to his ""Cinderelly."" The mischievous, near-Cheshire cat Lucifer nearly steals the show in a funny food fight scene.

The paltry extras are highlighted by a behind-the-scenes look at a Cinderella stage show on Disney's cruise line, and an overlong, simplistic DVD game young children will tire of quickly. ""Cinderella III""'s animation isn't at the theatrical classics' level, but still above traditional TV animation. At 74 minutes (near perfect for young children), the film gently and effectively points out the ""perfect year"" Cinderella sings of in the film's first scenes came not just from a foot fitting a glass slipper, but two hands and hearts reaching for the same thing and finding it together. This modern twist in moral, fitting into a modern twist in a hoary fairy tale, makes ""A Twist in Time"" a pleasant, recommended surprise.",1170460800,21,2586,5.362068965517241

2667750,4,B000JBWWRO,"Many of us grew up watching Cinderella, Bambi, Dumbo and other Disney classics. As such, they developed a very special value in our memories, one that is hard to challenge by means of sheer technological updates or attempts to revive a succesful franchise.

In past times, Disney unsuccessfully attempted fairly often to revive the memories that some of its classics evoked, but in the past 2-3 years a number of Disney titles have broken the ""spell"" of failed sequels that surrounded the studio for many years. ""Bambi II"", in 2006, and ""Cinderella III"", in 2007, are the two most recent examples of this trend.

""Cinderella III"" breaks out from a point in the legendary fable, that we are all familiar with: empowered with the fairy godmother's magic wand, Cinderella's step-mother rewinds time to make the glass slipper fit the foot of Anastasia, one of her daughters. From that point on, a completely new alternate story is spin off, one leading Cinderella out of her royal life and Anastasia in her spot.

The twist works surprisingly well, resulting in movie with a Cinderella determined to regain her spot back while Anastasia, her sister and their evil mother pull in the other direction. While predictable, the animated flick is very enjoyable and memorable.",1169942400,46,1266,4.990521327014218
2667751,3,B000JBWWRO,"I am not a proponent of Disney milking the cash cow of their classic animated films by producing far inferior sequels.  About half of the films in the Disney animated library now have direct to DVD sequels.  However, the quality of the recent rush of Disney animated sequels have been much better than the sequel predecessors (BAMBI  II for instance wasn't too bad of a direct DVD release).  Maybe the folks at the Giant Mouse House have received enough complaints that they are trying to make decent sequels.

CINDERELLA III:  A TWIST IN TIME is nowhere near as good a film as the original Disney CINDERELLA.  However, the film isn't too bad of a movie, especially for a direct-to-DVD release.  It looks more like a Wonderful World of Disney episode or a Friday evening special instead of a Saturday morning hack-job cartoon that many direct-to-DVD cartoon look like.

The movie begins on the one-year marriage anniversary of Cinderella and Prince Charming.  Cinderella's Fairy Godmother seems to become more absent-minded and throws her magic wand into the air and looses it.  It lands in front of a hidden Anastasia who has just learned that Cinderella had magic in helping her win Charming's hand.  She rushes back to tell her mother the news.  The evil Stepmother uses the wand to turn Fairy Godmother into a statue, turns back time to prevent Cinderella from marrying Charming, and casts a spell on Charming so he falls in love with Anastasia.  Cinderella and her mice friends, Gus and Jaq, know something is out of place, but they don't know what.  But they don't give up and are determined to break Charming out of his spell.  After all, in a fairy tale love conquers all.

CINDERELLA III is clearly a movie made for young children, especially very young girls.  Very young boys (three or younger) might enjoy the movie, but the film's overall message and focus is on young girls.  Other than a few visual allusions here and there to classic swashbuckling movies, there really isn't anything to interest parents, either.  The style of animation is an interesting merge between the classic-style of the original CINDERELLA and more colorful and contemporary cartoons.  With that said, the movie could have been much worst.  When I first heard about the plot of the film, I thought it was fitting because Disney often acts like the evil Stepmother trying to turn back time to make more money and change and legacy and history of some of their most cherished creations.  However, in watching CINDERELLA III I'm beginning to wonder if Disney is more like Anastasia and is learning the error of its ways.

In watching the movie, be sure to watch through the credits as various paintings answer some questions the story left open and halfway through there is a coda to the film's events.

The DVD doesn't include many special features.  There is a music video with Hayden Panettiere (who voiced Kairi in the Kingdom Hearts games and plays Claire Bennet on HEROES), a behind the scenes look at the Disney Cruise show, ""Twice Charmed"" which inspired CINDERELLA III, Bibbidi-Bobbidi Game, and an interactive activity called Cinderella's Ballroom that only works using a DVD-ROM on a computer.",1169856000,14,3191,4.873840445269017
2667752,4,B000JBWWRO,"I am certainly one of those people who took the advent of direct to video/DVD sequels of the classic Disney films as yet another nail in the coffin of American popular culture.  However, I have to admit that I have been pleasantly surprised by some of the most recent offerings in this corporate enterprise, most notably ""Bambi II,"" which was most certainly not an embarrassment compared to the original.  As an general rule of thumb I have found Disney's sequels to be at least a star less than the original, and that is the case with ""Cinderella III: A Twist in Time,"" which has the virtue of being a thought provoking critique on the original 1950 Disney animated feature film that would actually be worth discussing with kids after they have seen it.  I did not see ""Cinderella II: Dreams Come True,"" but that does not seem to be any impediment to skipping that sequel for this one.  What is important is that you have seen the original.

The twist here is supposed to ""What if the slipper didn't fit?""  But that is not at all what happens here.  Anastasia, one of Cinderella's stepsisters, is depressed because of all the happy ever aftering that is going on without her when she stumbles across Cinderella's Fairy Godmother and learns that it is the result of magic.  The next thing we know Cinderella's evil stepmother has the Fairy Godmother's magic wand in her possession and to get revenge she turns back the hands of time to the moment when the Grand Duke showed up at the front door with the glass slipper.  Before Cinderella comes down the stairs the evil stepmother uses the magic wand to make Anastasia's foot fit the slipper, so it never gets to the point where the slipper does not fit Cinderella.

In the original telling of Cinderella the slipper was made of glass because in her effort to have it fit her the large feet of her daughters the evil stepmother had one but off a toe and the other a heel.  Since it was a glass slipper everyone could see all the blood.  That is never going to make it into a Disney version, but the original ""Cinderella"" made nice use of the glass slipper in a different way when the evil stepmother breaks the one the Duke has been carting around the kingdom.  This sets up my favorite moment in the original, which is when our young heroine reaches into her pocket and produces the other glass slipper.  ""Cinderella III"" follows up on that in a nice way when once again one of the glass slippers gets broken.

As the King explains to the Prince, loving someone has to be based on more than ""their choice in transparent footwear,"" and that line is central to how ""Cinderella III: A Twist in Time"" asks its young audience to go beyond the original fairy tale.  Even in a time when shoes were made individually to fit someone's foot instead of being mass produced, the glass slipper is going to fit more than one person.  So as the Prince learns, picking a bride because the shoe proverbially fits is not the best way to live happily ever after.  Meanwhile, the evil stepmother learns that there are some things more powerful than magic.  I also see this version as being influenced by ""Ever After: A Cinderella Story"" in that one of the evil stepsisters is not as bad as the other (and I was also happy to see that the first painting in the end credits answered the question I had about Anastasia's fate).  The net result is an interesting re-examination of some of the assumptions of the original tale within the framework of that original movie and without resort to a ""modern"" re-telling of the tale.  So I think most viewers will be pleasantly surprised with what they find here.

The level of the animation here is not up to the level of a theatrical release, which is hardly surprising (""Bambi II"" is an exception, but they clearly had to up their game with that one).  The songs this time around are fine, but while Gus, Jac and two of the bluebirds are back the female mice from the originally are strangely missing (I have liked high pitched singing mice from ""Cinderella"" through ""Babe"" to today).  In terms of special features on this DVD there is a music video featuring Hayden Panettiere (best known now as the cheerleader from ""Heroes"") and look at another musical variation similar to this Cinderella theme done for a Disney cruise ship.  In terms of games and activities there is the Bidbidi-Bobbidi Game where you get a chance to ""grab the Fairy Godmother's wand and make some magic of your own,"" and Cinderella's Ballroom, where you get to dance to the Princess Jukebox, choreograph your own ballroom dances, and even use your own photos to turn yourself into a princess (in other words, some of these are DVD-Rom features).",1169769600,7,4691,4.582535885167464
2667753,4,B000JBWWRO,"I went to a pre-screening of this movie with very young friends of ours, 5 and 3, and my 15 year old daughter.  Having hated the original animated ""Cinderella"", I wasn't expecting much.  But I really enjoyed this one.  The mice are hysterical, Cinderellie turns out to have a lot of spunk and a good sense of humor, the stepmother's eerily creepy, and the stepsister turns out to be a good egg.  It has a lot of sight gags, and the writing's good - plenty to laugh at and get carried along by.  Plus, there is still good princess value for the tiny ones - pretty dresses, dancing, wedding, etc.  Get it, you'll enjoy it, and won't hate watching it more than once.",1169510400,10,663,4.349593495934959
2667754,4,B000JBWWRO,We attended a special viewing of this movie with 10 preschoolers.  They all loved the movie.  I thought it was well done and had a very nice message for all to learn.,1169337600,5,166,4.15625
2667755,4,B000JBWWRO,"What happens when the evil stepmother gets the magic wand?  This is what this movie explores.  It shows the power of true love, imparts the lesson of being true to oneself, and has enough gag laughs for the little ones to be tickled with.  The songs where actually quite good - and the pace of the movie was quick, no lulls.  Cinderella does come off as a strong woman, not a weak helpless maiden, and overall - a good movie for your little princess to watch.  Enjoy.",1169251200,6,467,4.32183908045977

8149414,4,B000JBWWRO,"I am a huge fairy-tale fan, and my all time favorite is Cinderella. I was very disheartened with the cheap sequel ""Cinderella II."" Because of how badly that one was done, I didn't even bother to check out ""Cinderella III"" for 10 years. At last, I heard somewhere it was well done so I watched. I can now say, it is a very nice sequel.
Positives:  Quite funny at times. Great story. Real character development. You will get to know the characters. The prince is a nice guy. I really liked how they grow Anastasia's character (I won't say fully as to give away the ending). I mainly loved seeing more of Cinderella's true character. Some people replied that in this version she finally grows a spine. I would say she always had one (she did make at least one snarky remark to the mice about her step sister in the original). To me, in the original, Cinderella didn't see a choice. That is why ""A Dream is a Wish."" is so potent. It is about hope in adversity. This one shows Cinderella's character beautifully as someone who see's the way and will fight for it.

Negatives (In my view): I didn't think the graphics were as good as the original. I thought, at times, the humor was a little silly. The music was a little mediocre but not bad. I didn't care for the song, ""More than a Dream"" because I thought it missed the point of ""A Dream is a Wish."" A dream, hope, is very powerful.

Anyway, that is my two cents.",1484956800,,1411,4.316981132075472
