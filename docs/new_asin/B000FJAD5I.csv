8201419,2,B000FJAD5I,"This DVD contains 5 tracks from the 1968 Royal Albert Hall show (Sunshine Of Your Love, White Room, Crossroads, I'm So Glad, Spoonful, NOT from 1967 as stated on the DVD sleeve) that has been available for eons, plus one from the Smothers Brothers TV show (Sunshine Of Your Love) in a dismal, insufferably bad quality, and 3 tracks from the Hall Of Fame reunion performance in 1993 (Born Under A Bad Sign, Crossroads, Sunshine Of Your Love) in a very washed-off-VHS-dub-from-TV-quality which grants no more than one or two viewings. I paid about 4 bucks total for this at the bargain bin of a supermarket, and it is probably not worth a single penny over what I paid for it.

Please note that, while this DVD was originally released in PAL format (and Region 2) in the UK, my version is a South American issue in NTSC (Region Free). Check with your seller before placing your order. But again, after the awareness of the sub-par quality of this product in the first place, you might wonder ""why bother?""",1367452800,2,1003,4.603351955307263
