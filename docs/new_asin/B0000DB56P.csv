1921659,4,B0000DB56P,"Chances are if you've made it to this review, you're already a fan of Simple Minds and need no convincing that they are much more than the band that recorded ""that song"" for a John Hughes movie.  You also probably fall into one of three camps when it comes to the Minds - either you're a fan of all their work, you think their most creative period ended with NEW GOLD DREAM before they really hit it big, or you think their pre-NEW GOLD DREAM work is too weird and experimental.
Me, I fall into the second camp, though they have really made a comeback in recent years with their highly underrated CD CRY, and the as-yet-unreleased OUR SECRETS ARE THE SAME.  But the great thing about this DVD is that it really has something for every fan, offering not only their entire (well, almost) collection of promo videos, but remastered live footage and early TV performances.  I'm astounded that their record label compiled this vast collection, as they seemed to have given up on promoting their work long ago.
Even though this has not been released in the United States, it is well worth ordering from Canada or other sources.  You really get a lot of bang for your buck.
Disc One contains nearly all the Simple Minds promo videos.  And it unintentionally shows what happens when an artsy band is thrust into the commercial spotlight, and all the trappings that follow.  The same thing has happened in recent years to Radiohead, and they became even more inaccessible as a reaction to fame.  The Minds took the opposite course, which, at least in sales, became their downfall.
The videos begin with the singles from SONS AND FASCINATION, and up through the SPARKLE IN THE RAIN period showcase a band - and their hired directors - struggling to make sense of the new medium of music video, with hilarious results.  Chances are the visuals you had in your head when hearing these songs are definitely not what made it to the screen.  The most hilarious videos are ""Love Song,"" where the band struts into a stuffy Glasgow dance club and fights with the patrons, and ""Glittering Prize,"" where the band performs in a room covered in gold tin foil, and Jim Kerr ends up in a sarcophagus!
Although silly and naive, these videos are much more enjoyable to me than the mega-budget, CGI-filled productions that you see today.  Maybe I'm just getting old!
Then comes our favorite ""la-la-la-la"" song, followed by ONCE UPON A TIME.  Now the Minds were backed by major label funding, and still didn't really know what to do with it.  The videos from this period were truly bad, and the most laughable fashions from the 80s - military hats, pant legs tucked into boots, shoulder pads, white trench coats - begin to rear their ugly heads.  Of course, fashions always look silly years later, but the Minds (or perhaps their costuming department) threw themselves so fully into the mid-80s fashion closet that it instantly put an expiration date on their work, at least visually.
After a long hiatus, the Minds returned with STREET FIGHTING YEARS, and the videos, like the album itself, showcased a stadium rock band taking themselves way too seriously, jumping on the U2/Sting/Peter Gabriel charity-rock bandwagon.  They simply weren't meant to be sincere stadium rockers, and it shows.  So most of the videos from this period through REAL LIFE are basically the same clich'-ridden concert videos that were so inescapable at the time, with lots of lighter and flag waving, hands in the air, Jim Kerr shaking sweat off his brow a la Ozzy Osbourne.  It says something that their video for ""Mandela Day,"" a tribute to the then-imprisoned leader, features mostly footage of the band performing before adoring, Simple Minds flag-waving fans at Wembley.  Only ""See The Lights"" from the REAL LIFE album - one of their prettier songs - really stands out from this era, beautifully shot in black and white in the Scottish Highlands.
The Minds never recovered commercially from this period, with GOOD NEWS FROM THE NEXT WORLD basically rehashing the bombastic production from the 80s - in the mid-90s! - while NEAPOLIS, though a good try, just seemed too much like their answer to U2's POP.  The video collection ends with the title track from CRY, a weird piece where mimes take the place of the band.  Unfortunately this was the worst song on an otherwise great album, and ends the video collection on a down note.
But then the live tracks kick in, and this is where the DVD really shines.  Disc One contains performances from the Old Grey Whistle Test TV show, which I'm sure many fans have never seen before.  Now we finally hear songs from LIFE IN A DAY, REEL TO REAL CACOPHONY and EMPIRES AND DANCE, performed by a shockingly young and awkward band, obviously influenced by Roxy Music but beginning to find their own voice.  It's hard to believe this is the same band that would fill stadiums years later.  But their sound from this era has not aged that badly, and is the distant cousin of what Radiohead and others would be producing in recent years.
The second DVD contains the ""Verona"" concert video, beautifully remastered.  Unfortunately, ""Verona"" was taken from the STREET FIGHTING YEARS tour, which means it's as self-important and bombastic as the album itself.  But the older songs are still great, especially pumping through a surround sound system.
They saved the best for last, as we suddenly shift back in time again for a Newcastle gig from the NEW GOLD DREAM tour.  This concert set really shows the band at the height of its powers, touring behind what was arguably their greatest album - just an awesome performance.
So while the promo videos are interesting and at times humorous to watch, it is the live footage that really makes this set worthwhile.  And since this is probably the only video collection we're going to get, then it makes the very reasonable price tag even more attractive.",1076284800,31,5884,4.754420432220039
1921660,5,B0000DB56P,"Finally, after all these years, we get a dream come true!  I won't go into the details of this spectacular double-DVD set except that if you are a hardcore Simple Minds fan (like I am), you should definitely buy this.  You can't go wrong with 26 promo music videos and a full live concert!",1076198400,5,289,4.333333333333333
1921661,4,B0000DB56P,"Simple Minds were never a visual band. They were more about the music they played and playing live. Jim Kerr was hypnotic but not as creative as Peter Gabriel or David Bowie in his stage act. What you get on ""Seen The Lights"" is two discs worth of videos and live concert footage plus some dvd-rom extras.
I suspect if God had a band in heaven it would sound like Simple Minds. They were, and still are, extremely capable of combining electronic, rock and punk into one penultimate cacaphony of beautiful sound. Often unfairly compared to U2, Simple Minds have established their own sound and niche in the pop/rock music pantheon.
Disc One: The Videos. You get 26 videos ranging from 1981's ""Love Song"" from the ""Sons and Fascination"" album all the way up to 2001's ""Cry"" from their last album ""Cry"". As I stated before, Simple Minds were not a video band, although I did enjoy seeing ""Alive and Kicking"" and ""All The Things She Said"" again. At the end of disc one you get five performances from a show called ""The Old Grey Whistle Test"" and one performance from the Oxford Road Show. The staged performances give you some insight into the band when they were just starting out in 1979. They would of course go on to better things! All of disc one is digitally remastered in 2.0 stereo and sounds great! Here is the track list for disc one:

Disc Two: Here you have Simple Minds live in Verona, Italy from 9/14-15/89. The sound was digitally remastered in 5.1 and is fantastic! The show predominantly features music from ""Sparkle In The Rain"", ""Once Upon a Time"" and ""Street Fighting Years"". At the end of the disc, for those Minds fans that wanted earlier live footage, you get a mini-concert titled Late Night In Concert from 11/20/82 featuring music from ""New Gold Dream"".

All in all, a complete collection of everything Simple Minds, but I give it four stars because they were not a visual band, they were more about the music. Also, the videos could have been remastered in 5.1 as Eurythmics and The Police have already done. I got my copy from Canada, but the back of the box states it's region free. There's approximately 4 hours and 20 minutes worth of material on this compilation. If you're a Simple Minds fan, or just interested in learning more about the band, this is a great place to start.",1075766400,28,3688,4.564102564102564
1921662,5,B0000DB56P,"...but if you're reading this, you already know that.
A band that matured beautifully is now given a DVD that caters to their particular talent...wonderfully melodic and stingingly political music.
The promotional videos are...just okay. I've never thought that visual image did that much for recorded music. You know they're lip-synching, so that takes away some of the mystique of the whole production.
No, what you're paying for here is the live material, particularly VERONA. Wow! What a show, even if it is interspersed with interviews and superfluous crowd shots. The continuity is there and the band is in terrific form, especially on STREET FIGHTING YEARS, BELFAST CHILD, and KICK IT IN. The Newcastle footage is also amazing, and what's really amazing is four or five of the songs are from my favorite SM album, NEW GOLD DREAM (81-82-83-84).
If you're even a marginal SM fan, you'll have a good time with this 2-disc set.",1075248000,4,930,5.006451612903226
1921663,4,B0000DB56P,"Straight out of the package it is a nice box, better than the average DVD packaging.  Reproducing their previous double live album packaging and artwork.  Too bad there is not a longer booklet.  However, I find far too many DVDs today are still lacking in good booklets, cheers to the Pet Shop Boys for their Pop Art DVD, it thorough and detailed.
First impression of the video is the pixelation of the print transfer.  The menu pages are grainy and pixelated.  The video history on Disc 1 has better video quality, but the grain and pixelation comes back on all of Disc 2. Whether this is way it was intended or there was a lack of video editing, who knows?
Content is great for the most part.  The early videos, the Old Grey Whistle Test, the Newcastle Concert footage and the Verona concert are all great to have on one package.  There is definetely an emphasis on the music from Once Upon A Time onwards.  Far too many videos of their late 80's to 90's career, which for most Simple Minds fans is the weakest part of their career.  The most significant video ommission is New Gold Dream 81-82-83-84.  As well, with the Verona Concert, the sound is great, the band is in fine form, but the concentration of music, of course, is their later era.  Not a single song from New Gold Dream or earlier (Theme for Great Cities is only used as a concert intro).  The highlight was songs like Waterfront and East at Easter.  ***A note for concert filmakers, is it just me or do some concert filmakers skip back and forth between band members and crowd scenes far too frenetically?  The camera never focuses on one person or thing for more than a couple of seconds throughout the whole concert.  Same goes for the Coldplay DVD and others***.  For those of us looking for early concert material the 83 Newcastle Concert on Disc 2 is a treat, with rousing versions of Big Sleep and New Gold Dream.  What would have been even more of a treat is if they remastered the audio for this concert to 5.1 surround as they did for the Verona Concert.  However, one can't quibble too much when the content is good.
If you are a fan of Simple Minds you will find this DVD a must as it is the only thing out there at the moment.  The benefit of DVDs is the ability to skip the stuff that you don't like to the stuff that you do and there is enough good stuff to make the purchase worthwhile.",1074729600,,2369,4.367579908675799
1921664,5,B0000DB56P,"Finally a DVD from Simple Minds!  And only 25 yrs after the band was formed.  First off, the videos are great, and bring back many memories.  The quality of the videos are fantastic, and the sound is good, but should have been updated to 5.1 DTS.  Only complaint is the missing videos for ""New Gold Dream"" and ""Book of Briliant Things"".
The 3 things that make this DVD a ""Must Have"" are the Extras and of course DVD 2.  The rare performance footage from ""The Old Grey Whistle Stop"" is AWESOME!!  Great songs from the LP ""Life In A Day"" and ""Real to Real"". You can definately see where some of the more popular New Wave acts of the early 80s got their influence. It's a shame that Simple Minds never really get that acclaim as one of the pioneers of that time. On Disc two, the concert from 1982 finally gives us some material from ""New Gold Dream"".  What amazed me is how tight the band sounded even back then, and you can see why Mel Gaynor is definately ""The Best Rock Drummer In the World""...as Jim would say...
Now...what can I say about the ""Verona Concert""?  I have been waiting over 13 years to see this show.  It has been available for sale only in PAL version that I have found.  This alone makes the DVD worth the purchase!  The sound was upmixed into 5.1 Dolby surround, again would have liked the DTS on this.  But, it sounds great!!  The show looks great and the quality is perfect!  I have been a Liza Germano fan ever since she started playing with Mellencamp, and she does a fantastic job with the rest of the band.  The concert is great, and is inter-woven with behind the scenes footage and interviews of the band in Verona. It really brought back good memories of the show I saw in 89 and then again in 92.
Well, I gave it a 5 star...Worth every dollar spent. Perhaps the long time fans with appreciate this DVD set more than the casual fan. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I have/and will.  Thanks for the memories guys!!!",1073433600,,1945,4.287671232876712
1921665,4,B0000DB56P,"If it wasn't for the technology we would not have a lot of these rare clips and video's. I've bought music DVD's of retro music from the late seventies and early eighties, but the audio always leaves something to be desired. The audio in this two DVD box set is quite good. I was really surprised to see some of these videos after twenty years looking and sounding so good.
I highly recomend it to any Simple Minds Fan.",1073433600,,419,4.3164556962025316
8000289,5,B0000DB56P,"I don't understand why some of these reviews are so harsh. I think they are really missing the point. The videos are what they are. Products of the time and technology, and the stylistic trends. If you love this band, this is a great addition to your library. The 1982 and 1979 live performances are great quality and worth the price alone. Reviewers: take this for what it is, a collection of videos and performances from a band that isn't afraid to experiment and grow. Either you like the band or you don't. True fans: buy it.",1483747200,,529,4.463917525773196

8000292,2,B0000DB56P,"I love the Simple Minds, but not this set. I felt it was poorly made patches of their work, which did not do them justice. The audio quality was all over the place. I sent this back. So sad.",1295395200,,190,3.8974358974358974
8000293,1,B0000DB56P,This product was unusable.  I would like to find out with Amazon who I need to contact to get my money back.  Debra Chanda,1284854400,,122,4.041666666666667
8000294,5,B0000DB56P,"Bought this set for a true Simple Minds fan. They were blown away with all the extras, mind you, you could buy just the concert in Verona for a quarter of the price, but my friend said the extras and videos were amazing. This was a Christmas gift which really made someone happy. I was able to buy through Amazon at a reasonable price given the fact that is a discontinued collectors item.",1263686400,,389,4.342465753424658
8000295,2,B0000DB56P,"I like Simple Minds, so it pains me to give this 2 stars.

The first disc is mostly a collection of music videos produced for the pop hits of Simple Minds.  The videos are fairly typical for 80s-90s pop hits--a lot of goofy settings and composition that usually have nothing to do with the music.  There are a few exceptions, like Belfast Child.  After the videos are about 5 songs from The Old Grey Whistle Test that show the band before they became a big pop phenomenon.

Disc 2 is mostly a live concert in Verona, Spain.  This concert is horribly difficult to watch.  The camera shots are rarely more than 1 second long and the shots that are longer almost always have the camera spinning at weird angles, zooming, fading, focusing, etc.  This wouldn't be a bad technique for a single song, but the whole concert is edited this way and makes this part of the disc unwatchable.  Most of the songs are the same ones that appeared on disc 1 as music videos.

Bottom line: There are a few, short interview clips, a collection of music videos, a recording of a live concert that is hard to watch, and a few segments of the band playing in night clubs at different times in their career.  The subtitle of the disc, ""A Visual History"", is apt.  I'll stick  to listening to their music instead of watching this.",1184198400,2,1306,4.436974789915967
8000296,4,B0000DB56P,"I am a fan of Simple Minds, to be honest, I am more of a casual fan that enjoys great music performances, and this is truly one of them. I bought this DVD not really knowing what I was getting and was pleasantly surprised! The combination of live concert and music video collection, all remastered picture and sound, was a nice welcomed package to add to my ever growing music and concert dvd collection. In my opinion, you don't have to be a die-hard Simple Minds fan to appreciate their good music that is well presented here.",1107561600,2,528,4.453608247422681
8000297,1,B0000DB56P,"This disc fails completely based on some simple criteria:  I regularly purchase live performance discs, not ""video"" collections.  They are to be viewed on state of the art 100 or more inch screens with well-sorted sound systems.  The object being, to get a sense of being at the event, either on or off stage, and attempting to recreate some of the energy of the performance.  This happens with sensibly produced titles.  Sound engineers generally understand that they are there to record the sound of the band, though on live titles, they sometimes rob energy when they ""clean"" up too much with remixes and other nonsense.  The folks who made this video hadn't a clue that they were recording an event that someone wanted to see.  Instead, there are cuts and camera angle changes less than a second apart completely obscuring any sense of the actual performance.  You can see in these tiny flashes that it must have been a good show, but it's worse than trying to watch something with a strobe light on.  This kind of condescending production makes no sense for modern playback.

The sound is OK.  It's nastily compressed, like most rock live events.  The fact that there is no performance to watch with it makes it pretty disappointing.  The video quality is also only fair.  My laserdisc containing some of the same material is as good.  I'd hoped for better picture and sound than the laserdisc.  That's why I paid the big bucks for the title.

The off stage parts in black and white are the only semi redeeming parts of the disc.  The lead up to the live show builds a nice energy, as if we're about to see something really exciting.  Then, the sound and the picture go their separate ways and we can only wish we had been there.  This disc won't allow us to experience a really wonderful live show.

Recommended only: if your TV is small, your audio system is Bose level or lower, and you will be satisfied with mere glimpses of some talented folks because this is the only disc out there.",1100736000,3,1995,4.594900849858357
8000298,5,B0000DB56P,"As the band that recorded my #1 favourite album of all time (Sons and Fascination/Sister Feelings Call), Simple Minds hold a very, very special place in my heart. Along with their albums ""Empires and Dance: and ""New Gold Dream"", these 3 albums represent for me some of the most amazing, unforgettable music ever recorded, and I have continued to listen to and love these songs all these years. Thus this career compilation DVD was a kind of dream come true for me.
But as another reviewer has noted, fans of this band seem to be very clearly split into 2 groups: those that love their music up to their 1985 commercial breakthrough with ""Don't You Forget About Me"", and those that are fans of what came after. I most definitely belong to the former group.
Although I still loved ""Alive and Kicking"", ""All the Things She Said"" was about their last decent song for me, (EDIT: OK, I did like ""Let There Be Love"") and after that point I became so disillusioned by everything I saw and heard from them that I totally lost interest and let them slowly disappear off my radar screen.
Years later, I was quite excited to hear Simple Minds were back with a new song. But when I saw the video for ""She's a River"" I was like ""WHAT is this?? -- Simple Minds trying hard to fit into the grunge age?"" There seemed to be no vestige remaining of the innovative and risk-taking electronic-influenced sound I had so loved.
After that I never heard of them again and assumed that the group must finally have bitten the dust. Now with this compilation, I have learned that in fact they have been together all these years, quietly putting out music. Going through all the loads of material here has been a welcome but bittersweet experience.
Looking over their whole career, it seems as if Jim Kerr has had 4 very distinct singing styles. The first phase spanning their first two albums is represented here by rare 1979 footage from British TV and a New York club gig. I am not a fan of the group at this point, as I always found his voice here to be an annoying whine.
Next we have my favourite phase, when his voice changed to a deep and mysterious throaty echo. From this period, we have not only the videos from my favourite 3 albums, but also TV footage of ""I Travel"" and the most precious thing in this entire DVD set for me, an all too brief but mind-blowingly good 6-song concert performance from Newcastle City Hall in 1982.
I see a foreshadowing of his next vocal style already at the end of ""Speed Your Love to Me"" (--""You go to my HEAD~!""). But he didn't really move into this 3rd style until after they shot to fame, when his singing very abruptly changed to what I can only describe as an ""over the top"" exuberance which reminds me of Bono and even at times (yuck!) Bruce Springsteen. It is from this period that the bulk of material on here comes, including Disc 2's beautifully-shot concert, ""Verona"".
Watching ""Verona"" brought a pang of regret, as I wished such a thorough and polished portrait of them could have been made earlier in their career when they were at their ground-breaking best. Out of the 14 songs played, I only like 3 (""Waterfront"", Don't You Forget About Me"", ""Alive and Kicking""). Watching the band in their ""rock star"" uniform jeans and t-shirts doing all the traditional ""rock star"" moves and playing such incredibly hackneyed licks is actually painful, and makes me wonder anew just how much of the genius of those albums I so love is Simple Minds, and how much is due to producers such as Steve Hillage. It is almost inconceivable that a band can so change and deteriorate in such a brief few years. My most hated songs of all, ""Belfast Child"" and ""Mandela Day"", showcase the band at their most overblown, pompous and pretentious stadium-rocker worst. Yech!! (*spits*)
Next we enter the 4th and latest phase of Kerr's singing. Someone must have told him ""tone it DOWN, buddy"", so he went to the other extreme and began singing in a very weak, subdued and quiet voice, which continues through their 90s songs to the present day. Out of these most recent songs, only one stands out for me here. Actually I think it is the video for ""Glitterball"" that I like more than the song itself. Whoever made this video for them seems to have really understood and appreciated the kind of urban, futurist, nocturnal feel that once made them great, and this atmosphere permeates it. But unfortunately Kerr's vocals are just too weak now to really make it work. Listening to this, oh how I wish he could return to his truly GLORIOUS voice of the early 80s!
With their most recent video, ""Cry"", I find myself unable to connect with where the band is coming from with either the song or video. Sadly, one of my absolute favourite bands of all time seems lost in the wilderness. I feel like yelling to them, ""Don't break up. Just come back to where you belong. Remember what once made you great.""
Despite the fact that I can't stand some of the material on here, I am still very, very glad to have such a complete record of the whole (sad) story. I only wonder if there were never any Top of the Pops appearances by them?
I am happy to give this set my highest recommendation for fans both old and new. All bands should be as lucky to have as thorough a compilation as this. Very well done!",1085270400,26,5292,4.496365524402908
