8188848,5,B000P4H946,An excellent DVD to learn ATS dance moves from the founder of ATS Belly Dance,1437782400,,77,4.2
8188849,5,B000P4H946,"As someone who truly wants to dance ATS but lives in an area with no certified instructors, this is the second in a series of DVDs that can help. Tribal Basics is the first DVD and this is the next (in my opinion). If you don't have the first, buy it before this one. If you are already ATS trained, this one is awesome. I own nearly all the FCBD DVD's and use them over and over to perfect my dancing. A must have.",1374105600,4,415,3.9523809523809526
