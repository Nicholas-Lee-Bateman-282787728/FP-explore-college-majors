1650717,5,B00005QW9J,"The Basket is one of those films which causes you to think and yet allows you to walk away from the theatre glad that you spent the time and money to see it. Peter Coyote and Karen Allen do a wonderful job in their roles in this film set in Eatern Washington. The film is a great choice for those with families as the material is not objectionable in the least and yet has the ability to capture the audience with stunning cinematography and a plot which intracately weaves in and out throughout the movie. This film has the feel of a classic foreign film and does not provide easy answers to every question it raises. It also has a wonderful story line concerning the early development of the game of basketball which portrays that development accurately and yet retains the fun that sports films tend to characterize. The local actors called on to play the Spokane team are wonderful and led by their captain (played by Scott McQuilkin) they add great vitality to the film.  Most of the viewing public were shortchanged in the limited release of this film, due to heavyweight Hollywood blockbusters which hog the screens across the country. Now with its video and DVD release The Basket has an opportunity to allow viewers to see one of the top movies to come out in 1999. Having seen this movie in the theatres in Spokane I have been awaiting its video debut. Enjoy it, it is a great movie.",1003276800,24,1393,4.527777777777778

1650799,5,B00005QW9J,"This is a movie produced in the area in which we live so it holds a special significance to me and those that live here.  The Latah, WA. school where the Basketball game is played is now privately owned and used as a wedding/reception venue. The movie is good for all family members to watch together.  For that reason, I gave it a 5 star!",1438300800,,339,4.2

1650805,5,B00005QW9J,"I gave this 5 stars. What a wonderful uplifting movie for young and old. No sex no nudity, mild language and brief violence. I really wish they made more movies like this instead of the trash they are putting out today.",1395705600,,219,4.365853658536586

1650838,4,B00005QW9J,The depiction of the struggle of a German immigrant child to be accepted by a small town community during WWII is moving and relevant to similar struggles today.  The photography of the Palouse country in SE rural Washington is stunning!  The acting was excellent.,1349308800,,264,4.9772727272727275
1650839,2,B00005QW9J,"The director apparently has no patriotism. He omitted part of the pledge of allegiance when having the star say it. That is unpatriotic and unacceptable. For a great movie based on America, it was ruined by the destruction of he pledge.",1326326400,,236,4.780487804878049

1650841,3,B00005QW9J,"I thought it was a nice family friendly film.  However, the movie implies that the German orphans lost their parents due to American soldiers shooting them in the heat of battle in what is implied to be a German town.  Outside of some Russian units who entered the far Eastern territories of Germany at the start of the war, no allied troops, American or otherwise, ever set foot on German soil in World War One, unless they were prisoners.  Also, a letter the teacher sends to his associate in Boston, is postmarked November 23, 1918, when in fact the context of the movie suggests that the war is still on (the Armistice took effect earlier in November, 1918) during this scene.
  Also, a nice change of pace in that the German characters in the movie are actually positive, likeable people.  Generally, thats not the case in war movies.",1318636800,2,839,4.635135135135135
1650842,3,B00005QW9J,"This one is easy to recommend, and worth seeing more than once.  The movie's message is that war affects ALL of us.  Large helpings of pain help make that point, but (for me at least) the characters never really came alive.

Looks like my second viewing will be the last.  It knocked the rating down a notch.  I can count seven or eight, maybe nine stories in this movie.  The components are pretty good, but (sad to say) they do not form an organic whole.",1309305600,,456,4.305882352941176
1650843,4,B00005QW9J,"Very nice story, but some of the elements of the story just didn't make logical sense... nagging details about the basketball game: scorekeeper / referee.  Well acted, but just that the script wasn't very realistic in regards to their parts.",1273708800,2,241,5.025
1650844,5,B00005QW9J,"I liked this movie on all levels and the stories within stories.

But the thing I most appreciated most was the research and attention to historical detail the director and writers went to on the subtleties of the rules and style of the very early years in the sport of basketball.
In the extras on the DVD they discuss how hard that was. Teaching modern basketball players to take no jumpers, only two handed set shots for instance.
While many might think it was added drama, the roughness of the game in the early 1900s is not exaggerated.

No other movie I remember has shown the history of early Basketball, and they did so brilliantly even though it is really background for the larger plot lines.",1261180800,,702,4.563492063492063
1650845,1,B00005QW9J,"This film is not a salute to rural America of the past as its cover suggests.  It is an anti-war propoganda piece of the left.  It is an insult to every American now serving in our armed forces and to all who have chosen to serve this nation in the past.  A central character in the film is the father of a boy who lost a leg in the trenches of World War 1 and the guilt he now feels for ""sending"" his son to war.

Rather than a salute to small town America, this film is an attack on the very values so many Americans hold so dear.  There are more Americans who feel pride in the sacrafices their sons and daughters make in the service of their nation than there are who feel guilt for ""sending"" them to war.

The mothers and fathers of children who choose to serve in our armed forces do not ""send"" their children to war.  They raise children who know there are some things worth fighting for.",1168128000,3,895,4.109195402298851
1650846,5,B00005QW9J,"A story within a story. Rent or buy this DVD. Great acting,

great scenes, great plot. Wonderful family-type film.",1146614400,,114,5.0
1650847,5,B00005QW9J,"A Hallmark type film, written by some wonderful people (I know them).  The film has a great story line and a wonderful moral.  Good family film.  Two thumbs up as far as I'm concerned!!",1100217600,2,185,4.382352941176471
1650864,5,B00005QW9J,"This movie had everything - beautiful cinematography, a great storyline, great acting by Peter Coyote and Karen Allen, fantastic music. You won't be disappointed with THE BASKET!",1055462400,4,178,5.62962962962963
1650865,3,B00005QW9J,"For most Spokanites, the fun of seeing familiar surroundings and spotting actors that you might know personally tended to distract them from the content of the film itself.  I rented the video hoping that this movie would measure up to all of the publicity it received here in Spokane while it was being filmed.
I hoped it would be good; when I finished watching, I was just relieved that it wasn't any worse than it was.  It is not a complete waste of time, but I can't say I was left with any deeper insights into the human condition, although I know this movie was trying mighty hard to send a message.
I did appreciate the focus on anti-German discrimination during World War I, which is something we tend to forget about.  However, most of that discrimination was focused on recent immigrants and naturalized US citizens who were obviously foreign-born.  War orphans, I seriously doubt, entered into the mix.  Logistically speaking, I cannot figure out how American troops were in a position to be killing German civilians on German soil.
Also the story of the discrimination is told in a rather ham-fisted style, as we are beat over the head, again and again, with the fact that the dad hates these orphans because his own son died due to Germans, etc etc etc.  How many times do we have to have this illustrated to us?  Many scenes seem to be simply repetitive.
The subplot, featuring a fictional German opera, also beats you over the head with clumsy, all-too-obvious symbolism.  Yes, yes, we all get that the plot of the opera mirrors the events unfolding in the town.  The faux-Wagnerian music is almost impossible to bear at times.
The ending of the movie was also a bit too corny for my taste.  Everything seemed to wrap up a bit too tidily.  I suppose you have to make the audience feel good.
This wasn't a terrible movie; however, with some changes in the story line and some tighter editing, it could have been a rather moving little movie.",1042329600,6,1955,4.621387283236994
1650866,5,B00005QW9J,"Forgive me to indulge myself with my appreciation for this film and its excellent representation on rural farm life during the WWI era. While the film is about a rural farming community in the Pacific Northwest, because of its brilliantly historical likeness to many small farm communities in this era it is a symbolic story of American farm life in the early 20th Century.
The film places itself somewhere in the late summer through early fall of 1918 (before the Influenza outbreaks in October 1918 [for the Pacific Northwest region]) and before the Armistice in November 1918. The central characters are two orphan refugees from Germany who are sent to live with the local preacher/doctor. The townspeople of course didn't wholly welcome their new-orphaned neighbors. The movie plays itself out between the one-room schoolhouse and the farm families and their struggles to cope with social, cultural, and economic strains resulting from the times and the war.
The ""war to end all wars"" was a blessing and a curse to American farmers. This film represents both ends of the spectrum. Sadly, WWI proved more of a curse than a blessing. Farmers, if they planned and timed themselves well, without throwing themselves into debt, could make a substantial amount of money on wheat and other agricultural related products. For most farmers, however, the war brought about extreme labor shortages, increased inflation, increased debt and greater reliance on mortgages. Socially and culturally the war brought about unchecked patriotism that resulted in hostilities towards German Americans and German war refugees, increased censorship and generally, an increased role of the Federal Government. The war took its greatest toll on farm families (and communities) who sent they young ""doughboys"" to war. If they returned at all, they returned with immense social, mental and physical scaring.
In the end, after watching this film, you'll come out of the experience emotionally moved, historically aware and personally enriched.",1039824000,12,2019,5.332288401253918
1650867,4,B00005QW9J,"""The Basket"" is a beautifully written movie. So deep that it's hard to sum up. It's about basketball. It's about opera. It's about war. It's about orphans and new immigrans. It's about a farmer and his wife coming to terms with the death of their son from the war. It's about a town overcoming their prejudice. It's about a stranger changing a small town.
It's about hope. A young German boy is bullied by the town boys and made to feel unwelcome by the town. The boy overcomes by having a goal--not fighting back with evil, but defeating evil with good.
I watched it with my 8 year-old nephew and he identified with the boy being bullied. My 12-year old niece came in during the basketball game and quickly got caught up in the story--wanting to know if Brigitta marries the Emery boy.",1026950400,4,786,4.503496503496503
1650868,5,B00005QW9J,"I originally saw this film on a flight to Germany last April. I guess you can't tell a book by it's cover, so when I saw the title ""The Basket"", I thought it couldn't be all that good. I put my book down, put on the head phones and was immediately drawn into the story and the characters. By the end, I was thoroughly impressed and noted that this film had to be one of the best I'd seen in years. It's such a great story, the music was great, and the scenery was fantastic. Since last April, I've been patiently waiting for the CD to come out, now that I have it, I've watched it a dozen times. I'll be watching for more films by Rich Cowan.",1010707200,13,642,4.0234375
1650869,4,B00005QW9J,"We saw The Basket in the movie theater last year. If you like a quiet, thoughtful film that is appropriate for the whole family, then this is it. If you want special effects, car chases and swearing, this is not the movie for you. As best I can tell, from reading other comments here, except for one or two detailed critiques, those not liking the movie found The Basket to be boring. Presumably not enough car chases and explosions. Those liking the movie enjoyed the sentimental story and the emotional power, and an ending where everyone won something more important than a basketball game. We thoroughly enjoyed this movie, set in a rural community in the early 20th century.",1006128000,8,679,4.714285714285714
1650870,5,B00005QW9J,"I wrote the music for ""The Basket"" so I'm not going to offer my opinion of the content. I will say that I have heard literally hundreds of responses. Most people love the movie with a very personal intensity. It is not unusual that someone cries when describing their favorite scenes. On the other hand a small number of people I have spoken with hated this movie so much that it made them irrational. I have even received obscene phone calls about it. It makes some individuals that angry. Puzzling but true. If you like sex in your movies, or violence, with macho male heroes and sexpot female heroines, and the F word sprinkled throughout this ain't your movie. But there are plenty out there for you. I think that's why it appeals without exception to retired age individuals. It harkens back to a time when movies were about storyline, not special effects and jarring shocking content. Love to you all, Don Caron",1005264000,11,917,4.631901840490798
1650871,1,B00005QW9J,"Only two words can aptly describe ""The Basket""--- Painfully Horrible. Don't waste your time on the ""Waste Basket."" I can't believe a made for TV movie(with a Sunday at 3am airtime) actually made it to DVD. What a waste of good technology on a piece of garbage (. . .)",1004572800,,267,4.36
1650872,1,B00005QW9J,"The storyline? Dull. The characters? Under-developed. The verdict? Don't waste your money buying it. It's a one-time renter at the most. The shots are nice and set a certain mood, but the painful dialogue and the german accents will make you cringe. If you liked any made for tv movie ever made, then you'll love this.",1003708800,,318,4.696428571428571

7951048,5,B00005QW9J,"I have watched this film several times and always enjoy it.  This movie is not about patriotism or lack of it, it is about people getting along together in love, being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes, and tolerating others shortcomings.  It is not about ""feeling guilty"" for sending your child off to war, but the natural feelings that any parent experiences while working through the ""if only""s when his child is suffering.  It is about many of the basic principles this country is founded on, and the lessons Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount.  It is sobering and soul searching....What would happen if no one went off to war but instead learned to get along with others as Jesus taught?",1484524800,,708,4.64
7951049,4,B00005QW9J,I would have given this movie five stars except for the wrongly produced aspect ratio. This DVD is labelled as 'widescreen' and 'enhanced for widescreen TV' but this is incorrect. The video displays as a weird approximation of 2.4:1 with black bars top and bottom and with the picture squeezed down to about half of the correct height. This requires a bit of fiddling with the zoom settings on my widescreen TV to get a watchable picture. Since my projector does not have the same facility I cannot project the movie at the size I would prefer to match Don Caron's splendid score. I suggest that potential buyers should not be put off by this mistake in encoding the DVD as I believe most modern TV sets can be adjusted to make the picture viewable. The movie is a treasure and I am so glad that I have just discovered it. Look for the soundtrack on CD also as it is wonderful if you can appreciate a gorgeous operatic score.,1473206400,,925,4.447058823529412
