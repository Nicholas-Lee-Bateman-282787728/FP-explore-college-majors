7071504,4,B00UVCHXVG,"If you are looking for family friendly entertainment with a great story, great acting and a ""feel good"" ending, this one will deliver all the above. Lance Henriksen was so believable as the tough old ranch owner and Allie DeBerry (Antfarm) delivered a thoroughly convincing performance as the ""troubled teen with issues"". Bought it at Walmart along with 2 other family titles last week. We enjoyed it.",1433203200,,401,5.0
