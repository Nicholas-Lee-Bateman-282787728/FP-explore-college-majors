7881058,4,6305039097,"I am old enough that I remember the days before television when we would sit around and listen to the radio, though I always remember sliced bread!  My mother always said TV was the best thing since sliced bread.  Watching this set of old commercials was a walk down memory lane.  I'm still am mad at my dad for not being the first dad in the neighborhood to buy a TV.  I thoroughly enjoyed this set.  More often than not, I'd start to sing along with the jingles.  It was bizarre to see the old cigarette commercials after they have been banned for so many years.  No wonder I smoke!!!  The picture quality is not the greatest, but neither was TV back then.  I was surprised that some of these survived.  For a feel of what life was back in the good old days when we had atom bomb drills along with the fire drills at school and mothers always wore dresses, I recommend watching this set of tapes.",1184544000,,898,4.260355029585799
7881059,5,6305039097,"I hear a lot of complaints about the picture quality and sound. I guess this is appropriate now that we are a technocracy composed of wide-eyed-digitized-DVD-emailing-cellphoning-computer drones. But w-a-a-a-y before I ever heard that annoying voice blurt out, ""You've got mail"", I remember banging on the side of ""Dad's"" black and white, snowy Motorola TV, (the one which used aluminum foil for improved reception). Kicking back on the couch with a popsicle and enjoying the Saturday morning cartoons and commercials.
That life existed eons ago.
Long before I ever knew about such things as divorce, overtime, kids, heart disease, or even what a prostate was...I knew those snowy, distorted, bluish-hued commercials. If you're wondering about the quality, well, welcome back to the past!",1029196800,,788,5.414634146341464
7881060,4,6305039097,"Even though the quality of the commercials isn't the greatest in the world, these commercials are very interesting. The highlights are the Mr. Clean, Pepsodent, and the coffee commercial with a VERY EARLY Kermit the Frog on tape 1, the Barbie doll, Kodak (with the kittens!), and the Hamms beer when the people ""couldn't grasp"" the handles on tape 2, the Monkees Kool-Aid commercial (with Bugs Bunny), Quisp, and Count Chocula and Frankenberry commercials on tape 3, the Marx Brothers Kodak commercial, the Tang commercial with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, the ""Johnny Smoke"" PSA, and the Kleenex Man Size where somebody sneezes and blows the entire room out the door on tape 4. These commercials are very entertaining and some are funny. Although a lot of the commercials on tapes 1 and 2 are somewhat boring. These tapes are not good to show kids, either, due to the fact that there are a lot of beer and cigarette commercials. Another perk is the Grape Nuts commercial with Andy Griffith and Don Knotts. THAT one will make you laugh! For the last downside is the Winston cigarette commercial with the Flintstones. I never would have thought Fred and Barney would be the type who smoke. All in all, other than the quality in picture and sound, this tape is very entertaining. For those nostalgia lovers, these will bring back memories.",990576000,15,1335,4.808695652173913
