5382100,5,B00A5ABQVM,"A great movie, as other reviewers pointed out the costumes were much better than the first ones (e.g. the head pieces didn't fan out to into the room). The acting was much better than the first aswell.  Any Dune fan will need to buy Children of Dune.",1418342400,2,250,4.319148936170213
5382101,5,B00A5ABQVM,met and exceeded my expectations,1416096000,2,32,5.6
5382102,4,B00A5ABQVM,"In my opinion, this is the best movie rendition available of the Dune story.

The Good:
The comprehension and treatment of the story is far superior to the movie made in the 80's by David Lynch.
The acting is good.
The character development is also good.

The reality of a Dune movie:
It's always going to make more sense if you have read the books.

The bad:
It was made for TV by the SyFy channel so it has a TV budget and TV special effects.  It was also made several years ago so the TV special effects are not as good as today's.  If you know that going in, you won't be surprised by it and can enjoy the story.",1414713600,22,616,4.0578512396694215
5382103,5,B00A5ABQVM,loved it thanks to you all.,1412121600,,27,3.6666666666666665
5382104,5,B00A5ABQVM,Every bok should be filmed.,1405814400,,27,4.6
5382105,5,B00A5ABQVM,I very much enjoyed this adaptation of the sequel to Dune. I much prefer this version of Dune with a sequel to the earlier version of Dune. The Children of Dune did a wonderful job of conveying the complex character development of Paul's sister.,1400112000,7,245,4.590909090909091
5382106,4,B00A5ABQVM,I found it to be confusing and overdone on outfits. They could have done better by cutting down on the sets.,1394755200,2,108,4.190476190476191
5382107,2,B00A5ABQVM,Disappointment. Nothing like the original movie.,1515801600,,48,7.166666666666667
5382108,5,B00A5ABQVM,"I upgraded my well-played Children of Dune DVD set to this blu-ray disc. Well worth it. This HD release takes full advantage of the mini-series having been originally filmed in HD to begin with. Picture quality on this disc is much, much better. Sharper, more eye-popping color, warmer tones and a noticeable improvement in the smoothness of the special effects shots and how they look next to live action.  The soundtrack also gets a slight upgrade to DTS 5.1 (this is the ONLY soundtrack on the disc).  The blu-ray includes the two special features from the DVD, plus adds a third which is basically a visual effects highlight reel showing original shots versus the completed, composited shot, pretty cool.  This imported disc is in English, but please note, there are NO SUBTITLES at all on the disc, unfortunate since the DVD set has English and Spanish subtitles.
 In conclusion, no comparison, this is the much superior version in terms of picture quality. And needless to say, the mini-series itself is excellent (James McAvoy is fantastic.)  So, if you don't need subtitles, I highly recommend that fans of this mini-series go ahead and double-dip for this one.",1512950400,5,1169,4.9438775510204085
5382109,4,B00A5ABQVM,"Great miniseries, the first chapter i found hard to keep up with but after that it was exciting and drew me in just like Dune did.",1511136000,,130,4.038461538461538
5382110,5,B00A5ABQVM,My husband loves this movie. He will not stop watching it.,1510185600,,58,4.363636363636363

5382112,5,B00A5ABQVM,"Great movie! Great soundtrack also! If you are a fan of Sci-Fi Movies, you cant go wrong!",1509667200,,89,4.294117647058823
5382113,5,B00A5ABQVM,Still a great story! Love it!,1507680000,,29,4.0
5382114,4,B00A5ABQVM,"I'm not reviewing the miniseries itself, just the technical merits of this disc. Take it for granted that the show is worth your while. TLDR: this Blu-ray release is the one to get:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Dune-Blu-ray/dp/B073VJ4V37/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Dune [Blu-ray</a>]

The SciFi miniseries never got a US Blu-ray release so I was tempted to get one of several foreign language imports, but I hesitated due to some compromises with them. Specifically, the burned in subtitles weren't in English and I was uncertain that the video would be unaffected by PAL speedup issues. This new Australian import addresses those issues. The disc is all region. The three episodes are encoded at their original 24 fps, not PAL, and the burned in subtitles are in English. The original English audio track is encoded in lossless 5.1 DTS-MA. The picture and sound are of high quality. No need to worry about uprezzed effects shots either, since the original shots were rendered in hi def, and are faithfully preserved here. This is probably as good as the program will ever look or sound.

There are some downsides, though. This is a bare bones disc. There is only the one audio track and no subtitles at all. The chapter stops are weirdly placed, spaced out at roughly 6 minute intervals in the middle of scenes. The two featurettes from the original Artisan DVD set are present, but are (rather poorly IMO) de-interlaced, scaled to hi def, and encoded as PAL. The storyboard comparison does have a director's commentary that wasn't on the DVD. There's a new short (3 minute) VFX reel in hi def, but it's also in PAL. And that's it. Fortunately, the important feature for me - the actual miniseries - is as good as it's going to get from a technical standpoint, and that more than makes up for the iffy treatment of the already scant extras. Would it have hurt to include a subtitle track though?",1507507200,15,1966,5.064814814814815
5382115,5,B00A5ABQVM,"Excellent followup to Dune, great visual effects, great story, unexpected ending.",1502668800,,81,6.454545454545454
5382116,5,B00A5ABQVM,I've been searching for this for many years as I remember seeing it on SyFy long ago.  Item came in perfect condition.  Wonderful to add to my Dune collection before the new versions come in the near future.,1501977600,,207,4.421052631578948
5382117,5,B00A5ABQVM,I've re-read all the books several times over throughout the years & finally bought this movie.  An excellent production & portrayal of the book.  I love it!,1501113600,,157,4.777777777777778

5382123,5,B00A5ABQVM,Dune has been one of my favorite books in my library. A truly talented and worthwhile book to be passed on to my grandchildren and theirs to come. Enjoy and pass on a classic.,1491696000,,175,4.176470588235294

5382134,5,B00A5ABQVM,"I loved this mini-series when it was on the Sci-Fi channel and was glad to find the DVD! My previous copy had literally been played to death. No problems with delivery or playback. Be advised that there is one scene that may or may not have been on the broadcast version, hence the rating. I'd forgotten this scene was there from my previous copy.",1479686400,3,347,4.4375
5382135,5,B00A5ABQVM,Making movies from books is risky.  The viewer must be able to treat each separately.  I loved everything about this series.  It was true to the book which I have read several times and the production was fantastic.  This is the second time I have watched the series and won't be the last.  It surpasses the Dune movie (which I loathed) by far.  So glad it is part of my DVD collection.,1478908800,,386,4.291666666666667
5382136,2,B00A5ABQVM,Does not work on my Blu-Ray players,1477785600,,35,4.142857142857143
5382137,5,B00A5ABQVM,"This is, by far, the best Dune-based movie/series I have seen. It's a made for TV sci-fi movie, so the production value can't stand up to blockbuster Hollywood films. Having said that, the effects and scenery don't disappoint. The plot sticks as closely to the source material as one could hope and the acting is decent, if a bit over enthusiastic at times. There probably isn't enough introduction to the characters unless you've read the book or watched the previous mini-series to really keep up with who everyone is and how they're related, but that helps the pacing for longtime fans.",1477008000,5,589,4.841584158415841
5382138,5,B00A5ABQVM,The item arrived in perfect condition and played flawlessly. The price was great and I am very happy with my purchase. I recommend this vendor.,1476835200,,143,4.76

5382144,3,B00A5ABQVM,"Odd how my review is the lowest. The problem is it's gets so much right but so much wrong. It is faithful to the book but gets some things so wrong that it pulls me out of the movie! The Freeman had blue within bue eyes...all blue, no white. It identifies them but in this move the eyes are wrong! This is only the beginning of the errors and they get worse and worse.",1470096000,5,368,3.9864864864864864

5382149,5,B00A5ABQVM,"An excellent follow up to the first SciFi channel miniseries of Dune and a MUCH better treatment of Frank Herbert's saga than the disaster of a movie that was made by ""Alan Smithee"".  Yes, there was a reason that David Lynch originally used that traditional pseudonym instead of his own name as the credited director of that sorry excuse for a film adaptation of Dune.",1464134400,2,368,4.661538461538462

5382153,5,B00A5ABQVM,there are multiple scenes that make up for the lack of density of the orginal book.  the actors are seemingly closely identified with their charactors and mood and back ground scenes is the best the creators could do with the restrained budget.,1453507200,3,244,4.809523809523809
