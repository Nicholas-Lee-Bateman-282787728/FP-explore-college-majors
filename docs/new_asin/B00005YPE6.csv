The warm-up, sun salutations, standing poses and balance poses is about 30 minutes, and the seated poses with savasana included is about 27 minutes. this is not for beginnres, it is ashtanga style, so a lot of sun salutations, very like Bryan Kest or Baron Baptiste. Her voice is nice, nice music, lots of modification, so if you are a beginner-intermediate is perfect to do, and if you are an advanced, you have the pose without modification, so is perfect for both levels. Like I said a beautiful workout.",1210291200,,553,4.595959595959596
