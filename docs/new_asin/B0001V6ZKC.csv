2025308,2,B0001V6ZKC,"I saw this when it was first released; I remember being kind of disappointed, because I was really excited to see James Coco in a dramatic part. This character was supposed to be loosely based on Fatty Arbuckle. The actors are good, but the story itself is weak.",1389139200,,262,4.479166666666667
2025309,3,B0001V6ZKC,"not a bad movie....i think it is loosely based on the Fatty Arbuckle scandal from the 1920s. raquel welch sings a

2025310,2,B0001V6ZKC,"I only ordered this because I'm in the movie.  It's actually a pretty bad movie!  If you like Raquel Welch or The Mission Inn in Riverside, CA, you might like it, but I doubt it.",1365811200,4,178,4.057142857142857
2025311,2,B0001V6ZKC,This film is mislabeled. It is not in fact the Wild Party from 1975 which is what I was interested in but The Wild Party from 1956 with Anthony Quinn.,1351209600,,150,4.033333333333333
2025312,2,B0001V6ZKC,"I read these reviews and bought this turkey. Anyone who wants it is welcome to it. This is tedious, silly, boring, stagnant, and predictable beyond words. Who was it that said if there's a gun on the table in Act 1, someone had better use it in Act 3? Bleech.....

Raquel plays a lovely woman who has achieved her position by talents other than intellectual. And wow, is that true here. She is lovely, indeed. But almost comical in her inability to act. She is however, not alone; this has the feel of an el cheapo porn film. A collection of has-beens and never-would-bes populate this film, all of them so clearly acting (badly) that you can hear and see and feel the director in every minute. Never for a second did this spring to life. Dead, dead, dead......

The costumes look gorgeous. The set (basically only 1) is great. The songs are sometimes witty and entertaining, with a nice 20s flavor. But the story, the poetry (even using that word is a stretch), the smut, that long dance(?) by the young girl, the script, and that lame conclusion all sink this leaky craft quickly and without a trace. Good riddance.",1239580800,5,1117,4.552238805970149
2025313,5,B0001V6ZKC,"This is an early entry from the Merchant Ivory team, and one which was unjustifiably dismissed on its initial release. It's a creative, well filmed and acted period piece set in early Hollywood, loosley based on the Fatty Arbuckle scandal. All the angst, drama, insincerity, drugs and general debauchery is perfectly and vividly captured. The movie features great performances from the entire cast Raquel Welch is execellent, Perry King gorgeous and James Coco tragic.

This DVD restores some of the cut footage such as the infamous orgy scene.

Another plus is the excellent music score.",1169164800,10,588,5.178947368421053
2025314,1,B0001V6ZKC,I bought this because Raquel Welch was in it. She did a good job but it's not worth it. I loss interest as sonn as I heard the guy talking about the people in the movie. This DVD was dated back to the 1920s and How a movie star struggles to get his life back.,1123718400,4,259,3.727272727272727
2025315,5,B0001V6ZKC,"This has been a pretty good year for fans of the lovely AND talented Raquel Welch. First 20th Century Fox released ""The Raquel Welch Collection"" box set, then Warner Home Video gave us ""The Last Of Sheila"" and now ""The Wild Party"", probably one of Miss Welch's best films! And thanks to the fine folks at MGM we have the ORIGINAL, UN-CUT version not the version originally released by AIP back in the 70s. And what a glorious film it is! Rocky is just great as Queenie, the mistress of Jolly Grimm (James Coco), a washed up silent movie comedian vainly attempting to make a comeback into pictures. She is endearing and sexy as his tender young lover, and the song she sings (""SINGAPORE SALLY"") is a real treat!
Picture and sound are both quite good on this disc and the extra's include the original trailer and a short interview with the director, James Ivory.
So, if you like Miss Welch (and how can anyone not???), check this disc out. You'll love it! Now if only MGM will release ""Kansas City Bomber"" and Paramount put out ""Hannie Caulder"", I'd be a really happy camper! - George Bauch,",1089590400,43,1089,4.532994923857868
2025316,5,B0001V6ZKC,"I am giving ""Wild Party"" 5 stars for a few reasons.  Most significantly is that this is the version that James Ivory had submitted to the studio, which then recut it for distribution through American International.
I remember seeing WP when it was first released, and believe me that  was an entirely different movie than is on this DVD.  A.I. was known as the distributor that marketed exploitation flicks, so it purchased WP as it was cut to emphasize an orgy sequence.
Ivory is not a sensationalist, if anything his films incorporate sex to advance the story, here the wildness of the party is just a by product of a much richer story.
Raquel, Coco, Bolling and King are all terrific.  The wonder of DVD is that this film makes sense, whereas the theatrical version and all the VHS versions do not.  This is really an amazing movie that was never released as it was intended.  Thumbs up to MGM for releasing this edition.",1087171200,36,924,4.603658536585366

2025345,5,B0001V6ZKC,Raquel Welch does a fine job in this drama. The scenes of Hollywood in the 1920's seem deatiled and authentic. Fans of Raquel will probably enjoy this the most.,1395619200,5,160,4.551724137931035
2025346,3,B0001V6ZKC,"Not the greatest, but Raquel gives an honest presentation. She's more than just a pretty face. I think this was a stretch for Coco, he's better as a comedian. All in all, worth watching for Raquel fans. Does drag a bit !",1391040000,,220,4.261904761904762
8016584,1,B0001V6ZKC,"I'm not quite sure what was worse, the script, the actors, or the 'wild' part of the movie which was nothing more than viewing too many totally flat chested women being touched by likely small penised men.  Slow moving, sophomoric and entirely too long, I hope I can get a buck for it at my yard sale next week.",1503964800,,311,4.271186440677966
8016585,5,B0001V6ZKC,"I saw 'The Wild Party' when it originally played in the movie theater back in 1975. I was in high school and went with my mother (an English teacher) and she explained to me, on the way to the movies, how the film was loosely based on a 1920s comedian named Fatty Arbuckle and a scandal he was involved with where he was accused of killing a young actress at a party he had hosted. I was very eager to see the film because I was a huge Raquel Welch fan since falling in love with her while watching 'One Million Years B.C.' when I was much younger. But, when I realized it was based on a true-life murder case (however loosely based) I was even more excited. I have always been fascinated with books/films that are set in the 1920s and early1930s. I was bringing a lot to the plate by going to see 'The Wild Party.' Sadly, I was very disappointed... not in Raquel Welch but with the movie itself. Sets, costumes, music, all seemed to reflect the period perfectly. Raquel gave a surprisingly great dramatic performance and her performance of the song 'Singapore Sally' was a highlight for me. But the screenplay seemed so disjointed and parts of the story didn't make sense. The pace and flow of the story being told was very uneven. Characters seemed not to be fleshed out well in the script. I kept returning to the film when it came out on VHS thinking I may re-evaluate my original opinion, but I never did....until NOW!
I had read several years ago that Merchant/Ivory productions were releasing a director's cut of the original film. Especially after American International decided to shorten the length of the film and therefore butchered the original intent and vision of the director. Key scenes were added  back in that helped with the character development, all the songs were put back in which helped set the mood for scenes and gave the film a 'Musical' feel to the pace and flow of the screenplay, and the famous 'wild party orgy scene' was back in. I bought it here on Amazon for my video library and all I can say is 'The Wild Party' is a whole other film now and transforms into an incredible 1920s Hollywood experience. I was transported back in time and felt like I was getting an insider's look into forbidden/decadent Hollywood and its movie stars. The main characters are now brought to emotional life unlike in the 1975 cut of the film. The addition of all the songs makes the music part of the storytelling and are placed just like they would be in a Hollywood musical. All of the choreographed dancing and movement adds so much to the atmosphere of fun. The flow, pace, and editing are pitch-perfect now. But the performances from all the main actors really stands out as a vast improvement. James Cocco is brilliant. I feel he benefited most from this restoration. His performance as Jolly Grimm runs the gamut of emotions. Raquel Welch gives her best dramatic performance to date. She was in her prime then as far as her beauty and looks like a 1920s dream in that slip where she is seducing Jolly by dancing around while getting ready for the morning. Very clever choreographed moves. The design of her party dress is outstanding. Her 'Queenie' is a vision to behold. David Dukes is more fleshed out as being a sort of Greek chorus narrating from his epic poem 'The Wild Party' and he bookends the film which brings it full-circle. Lastly, Perry King was physically a perfect 'Matinee Idol' type and his tango with Queenie outside the mansion is smooth and seductive. This whole restoration of 'The Wild Party' has rescued a forgotten film (that was nothing special) and now has offered the viewer a chance to see James Ivory's original cut of the film that makes it a 1920s Hollywood period film that is a masterpiece. 'The Wild Party' now joins in the ranks of my other favorite 1920s/30s films...'They Shoot Horses, Don't They?' (1969), 'The Great Gatsby' (1974), 'The Day of the Locust' (1975), and 'The Fortune' (1975).",1488672000,,3951,4.612215909090909
8016586,3,B0001V6ZKC,"This movie had excellent costumes, setting and acting but terrible directing (and presumably script). Coco in particular does a great job as a pathetic has been trying to get back to his former silent movie status by desperately schmoozing to the studio bigwigs and throwing a drunken temper tantrum when it fails. Anyway, the plot involves a bitter, abusive, Coco who is shacked up with Raquel ""they're fake"" Welch and he's throwing a party for friends, sycophants and a couple of movie suits, at which party he will show his latest film in the hopes that the studios pick it up. There are several characters involved and they get some time on the screen. The film does a good job at demonstrating the callous. cold, hardness of the movie business.

What went wrong? Well, first, one of the characters in the film is also the narrator, but he does a bad job of it and the narration just disappears. Second is the vocal music. It's hard to tell if it's being played by the characters or is supposed to be background music, and the music becomes irritating more than anything else, although Welch has a great number that she sings perfectly. Third, towards the latter part of the film when Welch is going to screw the handsome newcomer, you get the impression that they left the mansion, then that they're still there, then that they left, then---anyway at one point, the guests end up in various rooms having orgies. (That was fun)

It could have been a great film with a different director and a screenplay doctor.",1480032000,,1515,4.670411985018727

8016590,3,B0001V6ZKC,"Merchant and Ivory go to Hollywood to tell a Hollywood story, starring James Coco and Raquel Welch. This is one of James Cocos darkest roles and he has the most beautiful leading lady in the shape of Raquel Welch. How many movies do you know where the Welch sleeps with the Coco? In the first scene Coco gets to throw a hot cup of coffee on a very hot body and the hot body dances away the hot java with a hot number!

By now its clear that the Merchant/Ivory team is not going to repeat their style of film-making anytime soon; they are continually experimenting in narrative and story.

The acting in the film is not always spot on, which makes the dialogue in some scenes come across awkward and corny. I don't want to detail any plot points  but lets say youll walk away from this feeling hot and bothered on every level; its sexy, daring and dangerous. You have never seen a party thats wilder than this one. The only other complaint I have is that this low budget production suffers from often looking like great x-rated television drama rather than cinema; especially in the first thirty three minutes. It improves during the lengthy party scene which I enjoy for its daring. But I still fault the overall film for a lack of visual style and a weak narrative. There is a lot of inconsistency and it's not great cinema but the party scene which is most of the running time of the film, is a classic and extremely interesting to watch!",1455235200,,1440,4.426415094339623
