643853,5,6303406939,"If you like the UFC, and you don't have this video, buy it.  It is without a doubt one of the best UFC's ever.  In my opinion, the second best.  Royce Gracie comes back for revenge; everyone is out to beat Steve Jennum, the  alternate who won UFC III; Joe Son is back to avenge the loss of his good  friend Kimo against Royce Gracie, though he ends up making a fool of  himself...possibly the funniest fight in UFC history.  The most impressive  boxer to ever fight in the Octagon was in UFC IV.  And the championship  match ends up becoming a memorable fight that is still talked about.",914457600,,587,4.302752293577981
7846618,4,6303406939,"Old faces (Hackney, Gracie, Jennum) along with new up-and-comers (Severn, Mezger) complete a great field of fights. This UFC has everything from bone cringing groin shots (Hackney/Son) to acrabitic Suplexes (Severn, Macias) along with a pretty good dramatic final.",1160438400,,264,5.794871794871795
7846619,5,6303406939,"This UFC event it classick!!! I love the Steve Jennum vs. Melvin Bowen fight, it's great! I love seeing a big, stupid, black boxer go down and get beat by a chubby white guy! The boxer said ""I don't have respect for anyone here""...what a dumb...nevermind,anyways, i love the UFC and Pride fights because they are about the only sports left where black people can't dominate it, haha!!! I'm not a stupid racist,i hate everyone, even white people, but it is nice to see a sport where people with extra leg muscles can't completely dominate it! I like Hackney too, he does good against Gracie, i think if he would have landed that one lunging hook, gracie would of went bye bye, but at least Shamrock got to pop him in the eye in part 5. I don't like wrestling, but for some reason i like Dan Severn, and he has some good matches on this one. Overall, i really like part 4, it's highly entertaining to me. Hackney's ball shots are great too!!! I recommend!",1130544000,,953,4.420454545454546
7846620,4,6303406939,"UFC 4 saw the return of the enigmatic ROYCE GRACIE. After a vicious match in UFC 3 with KIMO, Gracie was forced to throw in the towel before the match started. And now he returns to the Octagon for some new challengers and some new fighters.
Gracie was awesome in this one as usual. He walked over RON ""THE BLACK DRAGON"" VAN CLEEF in about 2 minutes. Van Cleef is also the oldest fighter to fight in the Octagon at 52 (at the time). Gracie had some trouble against The Giant Killer KEITH HACKNEY, who defeated 600+ lbs of Sumo wrestler EMMANUEL YARBROUGH in UFC 3. But to get to Gracie, Hackney had his hands full with Judo wrestler JOE SON.
In my opinion, this was one of my favorite matches of this particular UFC. Trust me, Hackney gets Son to tap in a ""Different way"". It's very brutal. Hackney also did what very few fighters have done against Gracie and that's stay on your feet.
And who could forget the debut of DAN ""THE BEAST"" SEVERN. Severn was awesome in this one and he had 2 very quick and very brutal matches against ANTHONY MACIAS, Thai Kickboxing and MARCUS BOSSETT, Karate.
The biggest disappointment of this one is that reigning UFC 3 Champ STEVE JENNUM diesn't even get to defend his title. He fights one fight and gets hurt. A bit on the weak side and from there, I'm with the critics as well (Jennum should not have won UFC 3). Plus his opponent MELVIN BOWEN made boxers around the world look bad. Anyway check out this one for Gracie, Hackney and Severn. Those 3 make this one worth it.",1044403200,2,1508,4.370106761565836
7846621,4,6303406939,"For the first time, Royce Gracie has some good fights.  The first one is kind of a joke as he goes up agaisnt a prestigous, but over the hill master.  His next fight however is classic, agaisnt kenpo master Kieth Hackney (whom destroyed a 620 pound sumo wrestler in the previous ufc).  Hackney was the first fighter gracie went up against that knew how to defend agaisnt his attacks and kept the first half of the fight on his feet.  The only part of the fight that went to the ground was with gracie on his back.  It was an exciting bout, but the real action comes with the exhibition bout b/w the now prestigous Guy Mezger, a submission/kickboxing expert, and Jason Fairn, a canadian jiu jitsu master.
This ufc also introduces a new combatant, dan severn, whom in my mind ranks among the greatest greco roman wrestlers that have ever walked this earth (which is saying a lot since the art is a couple of thousand years old).  His first fight was just plain brutal and his second fight was quick, but action packed.  Then along came gracie, master grappler against master wrestler.  Both, masters of ground fighting.  Both, masters of takedown.  Both, master technicions.  Both, masters of ground defense.  Not exactly action packed but you spend the entire fight wondering who's gonna take it all?  It looks like it's gonna be severn all the way, but only a fool would count gracie out of a fight no matter what the situation is, especially when he's in his trusted guard.  The entire fight is spent on the ground, but what can you expect from two of the best ground fighters that have ever walked into the tournament?  You might be a bit surprised by the ending.  Many say it was a fluke, but I strongly disagree.  With technicions like them, anything can happen.
The basic message I'm delivering here is, if you're a fan of bare knuckle no holds barred fighting, you want this video.",1028505600,,1887,4.568452380952381
7846622,4,6303406939,"This took place during a good period during the UFC...Gracie was at the top of his game and Severn was in his early UFC years. Obviously they are the highlights of this tape, as Severn debuts here and just destroys everything in his path (the Severn vs. Macias fight includes one of the most memorable moments in UFC history...you'll know it when you see it). Gracie does well, although he has a B.S. first match which basically made it so he only had to fight two real fights to get into the finals. The Severn vs. Gracie final is a little long but very entertaining. Severn had Gracie's number here but Gracie wins on what many people consider a fluke (which may be true, since Gracie never had a rematch with him after this fight). Well worth your money.",1012089600,,757,4.453237410071942
7846623,3,6303406939,"UFC IV was a good one, but I've seen better. Gracie makes his return and gets his revenge. He defeats a 50 year old rather easily,then runs into some trouble with Keith Hackney. Hackney displayed good striking ability but in the end Gracie showed that he was too good, even on his back. The highlight of the video for me was Dan Severn. Severn pummels a muy thai fighter in the first round and walks through an alternate in the second round. Setting up the main event between Gracie and Severn. This fight was long and maybe a little boring in parts. It showed that Gracie's skill and composure were his greatest atributes. I think that Severn could of beaten Gracie if he hadn't been so one dimensional. This tape is worth watching if you are a fan. If your a first time viewer I'd recommend a different UFC.",996192000,,809,4.436241610738255
7846624,3,6303406939,"I've always been taught that the size of your opponent does not matter when it comes to hand-to-hand combat.  UFC 4 proved me wrong.
In UFC 4, we are presented with two very skilled fighters, Dan Severn, representing Greco-Roman wrestling, and Macias, representing Muy Thai kickboxing.  Keep in mind that Dan Severn is the heavier of the two.  When the referee begins the match, Severn, aware that his opponent is a kickboxer, delivers two quick sidekicks to Macias knees.  Macias, now that his legs are injured, is not able to kick effectively anymore.  Severn, knowing this, charges at Macias in an attempt to take him down.  Macias, being a Muy Thai kickboxer with injured knees, uses Muy Thai's second best weapon, the elbow strike, against Severn.  Severn takes all of Macias' elbow strikes without even flinching.  Severn, then, proceeded to pick Macias up and throw him.  Macias gets up and elbow strikes Severn about six times on the side of Severn's neck.  Severn, once again, ignores Macias' blows, picks him up, and throws him again.  This throwing of Macias continues for about another three times before Macias is completely worn out, thus giving Severn the opportunity to apply a choke hold.  Macias responds by tapping out.  The winner is, thus, the bigger and heavier fighter, Dan ""The Beast"" Severn.

Watch this tape and decide my opinion for yourself.",991699200,,1370,4.930131004366812
7846625,5,6303406939,"There were more bloody, rock em'-sock em', and terrible mismatches, but UFCIV saw a new chapter in the whole package. For the first time ""real"" announcers announced, and we saw more preparation used by  the fighters. This marked as the last UFC with the no time-limit rules, as  Royce Gracie used everything to regain his title. A super card, with great  techical and some nut-shot fights. A true classic, and to ths day remains  my favorite UFC!",963100800,,446,4.753246753246753
