7869872,1,6304341563,"The footage they use can be found on other ""stories"" about her.  In most of the old footage, there is no sound to go along with it, and the picture quality is very poor, like some kind of bootleg copy.  This isn't really worth buying, in fact I was very disappointed",1030233600,8,266,4.196078431372549
7869873,1,6304341563,"As I'm a usually satisfied customer, I'm very sorry to say that this product is a fraud. The content is no news to anybody who shows at least a little interest in Miss Monroe. 'Suicide, truth or fiction' has been many times played on TV, but let's say it is OK. But as regards the documentary, it is completely useless. I saw this week on the cable a doc that was 10 times better ! And the sound ... The sound of this DVD is just incredibly awful. Please believe me and don't buy that !",980380800,17,486,4.072916666666667
