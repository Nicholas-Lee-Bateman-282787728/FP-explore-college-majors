8476926,5,B005KLGG2K,"Having been to San Francisco Bay quite a few times, I got this DVD for my cycling workouts and to revisit one of my favorite places.
I workout to familiar places I've actually been and some I've never been before, but now will go. Every day is a workout joy using these visual aids and now they have one of my favorite cities to cycle around. Up through Mount Tamalpais is just like going there for real and for me, brings back great memories of our trips.  I've never been on the Carquinez drive and some of the other areas around San Francisco Bay in this video but I intend to go this fall. Great video, inspiring.",1376438400,,617,4.273504273504273
8476927,2,B005KLGG2K,"The actual movie isn't too bad.
Music is okay.
The disk itself is very cheap and looks like it was manufactured in someone's house and the label printed on a cheap ink jet printer.
I have serious reservations about how long it will last.",1370563200,,237,4.409090909090909
