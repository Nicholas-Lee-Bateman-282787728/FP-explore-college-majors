6036258,1,B00FXOO16W,"The actors were great in this horribly written show. I think even more than the annoyingly bad writing, was the edited music. It had nothing to do with the scenes. They must have just chosen a score and slapped it on the final cut. The comedy was forced in the character played by Biggs. The conversations and interactions between the women show that this was a man writing what he THOUGHT women would say when they're alone. Do your research. Talk to a female friend! It was super unrealistic.

The storyline, itself, could have come together into something nice, especially with Tichina Arnold and Rockmond Dunbar. Countess Vaughn is great but she was very ""Parker-ish"" in this movie. Unfortunately, many urban playwrights think that if they pull in headliners, they don't have to develop their story. Worked on me! smh...",1391558400,,824,4.885714285714286

6036271,4,B00FXOO16W,"I really enjoyed this film. Mrs. Arnold was great and she made an annoying character sweet. The entire cast was great. Bigg Gipps character was way too vulgar and immature. I never met anyone that stupid. Otherwise the script was well written. I think Brely Evans is gorgeous and I want to see more of her. Mr. Johnson is very talented and I enjoy most of his work. He definitely explores different topics. This film addresses issues such as faithfulness, weight, self esteem and forgiveness. Highly recommended for fans of romantic comedies with an African American cast.",1404000000,,572,4.907216494845361
6036272,4,B00FXOO16W,I liked the fact that the not so skinny woman got the man.  I also liked that what attracted the man was substantive instead of superficial.,1402272000,,140,4.384615384615385
6036273,4,B00FXOO16W,"The movie was good, like the acting and plot of two sisters that are different and what they do to find love, when love can be right smack in their face.",1401753600,,153,3.967741935483871
6036274,2,B00FXOO16W,"I like original storylines, and this is too similar to the movie ""Something Borrowed"". Originality is the key...sorry!! I hope you don't get in trouble for plagiarism.",1399248000,2,167,5.222222222222222
6036275,5,B00FXOO16W,Great plot. Great story. 8 would watch it again. It was very relatable. A lot of people would enjoy the cast.,1396828800,,109,4.238095238095238
6036276,2,B00FXOO16W,"Once again.. I must keep repeating myself by staying that I AM A BLACK MAN!! Just so when I make such comments it won't get twisted grin the facts... I am also from the Caribbean.. And where I am from.. We do not support messing around with two biological sisters at the same time..What kind of Nastiness is that message to be sending out to the black community.. And then to even suggest that the Man involved in this Nastiness still get his cake and eat it too... You writers still suck with your make ego huh!!!!... You still think it's a""""man's world """".. Trust me you did that to my biological sister.. I would beat you in the ground... My 3 sons do that... I would beatThem in the ground too..",1396828800,8,699,4.303030303030303
6036277,3,B00FXOO16W,This movie was okay. I would watch it again on a day that I would be extremely bored out of my mind.,1396656000,,100,3.590909090909091
6036278,1,B00FXOO16W,"I wouldn't recommend. I felt like the comedy was forced and not natural (as if someone thought it would be funny to say - it was a FAIL).  I liked the actors I just felt like the script didn't flow or it was poorly executed.

Could've been, should've been but it just wasn't to be (a good movie).",1392336000,,296,4.086206896551724
