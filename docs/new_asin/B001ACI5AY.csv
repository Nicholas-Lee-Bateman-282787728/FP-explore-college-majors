8276626,5,B001ACI5AY,Very easy for a baby to distinguish and learn the colors. The whole screen turns the color that its being taught in the moment and the color name is very repetitive. Both in English and Spanish. I have this dvd for my 1 year old boy.,1335916800,,233,4.086956521739131
8276627,5,B001ACI5AY,"Love the videos. I bought the four Spanish videos Conoce los Numeros, Conoce las Letras, Conoce las Figuras y Conoce los Colores, when my oldest son was 18 months and a few weeks after he started pointing at colors, shapes, number and letters. And the best part is that you can play the videos both in Spanish and English.",1332288000,,322,4.47457627118644
