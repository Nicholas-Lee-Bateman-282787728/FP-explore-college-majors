8374469,4,B002MZZU6K,"This edition, by Sinister Cinema, isn't as unwatchable as some of the other reviews indicate. It's not a high quality, recently digitally restored film, like some of the old silents, but it's plenty watchable.

The acting and direction are pretty good through out. The film is much truer to H. Rider Haggard's novel that some other film versions of the book. I'm a fan of adventure movies, and I liked this one.",1352764800,,411,4.708333333333333
8374470,3,B002MZZU6K,"The GOOD news is that there is a DVD available to the public of a silent film with Betty Blythe. As a matter of fact, the only one. Gained star points here. I wish someone would find and restore the silent film ""The Queen of Sheba"" and any other silent movies with Betty.

The BAD news is that this movie is not restored/remastered. It is a copy of a defective film (VHS?) that has been re-taped together. This DVD by Sinister Cinema, seems like some high school kids put it together for a project. The main menu screen is totally amateur in presentation. Lost star points here. Where are KINO and CRITERION when you need them?

The UGLY is the soundtrack! Though it is a ""silent"", it does have an orchestra background sound. Sometimes it is too fast paced to properly fit the scene. Sometimes too dramatic for the mood. Sometimes the sound is totally gone! Lost star points here. Where is UCLA when you need them?

This movie was filmed before the CODE was written in 1930 and went into effect in 1934. Many of the costumes worn by Betty Blythe are transparent and revealing. This was her trademark in the silent movies. She dared to be censored. In the scene where she steps into the fire, it is very obvious she is totally naked. Her long haired wig covers her for the most part, but not fully. Yes, her breasts can be seen! Betty  Blythe is my unsung heroine! Gained star points here.

As for the male protagonist in this movie, wrong selection! Lost star points here. They should have put Ramn Novarro! Ramn would have stepped into the fire to be with his goddess in eternal love! Watch him in the silent movie versions of Ben-Hur, Across to Singapore, or The Pagan.",1341964800,3,1671,4.465573770491804
8374471,1,B002MZZU6K,"I have just watched this verion of ""She"". Dispite having writen ""dialouge"" straight from the novel plus following the story quite faithfully its a pitty that She herself is portraid as a middleaged overweight matron with no waistline, to add insult to injury Leo/Kallikrates is played by a big nosed weedy guy, no hint of a greek god here, it would have been better to send  ms Andress back in time with a chippendale stripper for man candy (its silent film so who cares if he can talk!) were all people this ugly in the 1920s? im surprised that haggard himself was suposed to be part of the film production? Well its nice to know bad taste has no time zone. When are they going to do a dicent film version of haggards greatest story, the  1960s Hammer version towers over all other attempts so far. Perhalps this is one novel that just cant be filmed.",1293667200,,852,4.455128205128205
8374472,3,B002MZZU6K,"Very interesting film, its also a silent one...but with a good soundtrack for
background. i saw this film when i was young...30-40 years ago and again did
notice the eternal flame is just some kind of veil blowing in the wind giving
the illusion of a flame..still well done for its time. Having the other 2 versions of the film she...this silent version is a very needed addition. Thanks to Sinister cinema for making it available.",1280880000,,431,4.684210526315789
