5020341,5,B006UV9LC6,I'm pretty fond of this series now.  I started off with one and two and then some how missed three and ordered four and thought they were just interesting.  Now the third should be getting here pretty soon.  At first they might seem a little simplistic but if you're interested in Japanese culture and enjoy a light skin flick then you'll definitely find these fun to watch.  There really isn't any hidden meaning or masterful artwork or cinematography; and really there isn't a whole lot of story line although it's way better than anything pornographic.  Just simple straight forward Japanese entertainment.,1365292800,8,609,4.99009900990099
5020342,2,B006UV9LC6,"i really can't believe that the sexual abuse you watch in this movie can actually happened in the real urban life ... she actually seems very permissive and condoning , accepting and encouraging this male abusiness and even appeared to enjoy it !",1357430400,6,246,4.744186046511628
5020343,5,B006UV9LC6,"Hi, after all Merry Chrsmas for ALL. The reason within i like Tokyo Train  Girl 4:young wife desire,is there are the actress who plays the wife and the desire for me is the most powerful thing in the world and what the girl desires to possess she does. Desire is like WATER, anything nor anybody can' t stop it. Thanks and Happy New year 2013!.Your Komarith Soth.",1356048000,3,363,4.417910447761194
5020344,5,B006UV9LC6,"I really like the Tokyo Train Girl movies. This particular episode is no exception. Beautiful models/actresses are pleasent to watch and do their best to be sincere.

The whole idea of molesting beautiful women on trains is absurd, but somehow is something that appeals to me. While never a reality, there is something exciting about viewing the slow and deliberate exploration of the beautiful models.

I like a refreshing approach to the ""porn-like"" movies and the Tokyo Train Girl movies bring it off without the gross sweaty flesh over boobed chick movies that are in abundance.

So far I know of only four of these movies on DVD. If there are more please let me know.",1346544000,21,672,4.775862068965517
5020345,4,B006UV9LC6,"When calibrating soft-core movies, one has to use a different yardstick to review and rate them. That yardstick has to be adjusted again when evaluating American vs. European vs. Asian soft-core (I personally prefer the Euro and Asian flicks - the American ones are usually idiotically juvenile, or patched into horror/torture flicks, which I personally don't get at all). The unstated but ultimate purpose of these flicks is not only to entertain but to stimulate the viewer, and the best do both. But there are very few that succeed. If you don't believe this, I envy your naivet. If you think you're gonna mine gold in this arena, you're being kinda foolish.

Here's the down-lo on this Asian soft-core entry in this series - a wife is made aware of her husband's infidelity through a text message she intercepts while he's sleeping on their sofa with his cell nearby. She later learns that the woman he's having an affair with is a co-worker who was her subordinate when she worked prior to marriage. She reacquaints with a former family employee to set her world even more off-center, who she confides in and who vows to protect her always. What this means is ambiguous, but the nori-thin plot leaves plenty of time to devote to the lascivious behavior of all.

Light on language, long on lewdness, this series prides itself on multiple sex scenarios, and here we have the opening train molestation, a shower scene that`ll make you wish you were soap, a frolic with her husband, the husband making it with his mistress, a brief shower scene w/ the girlfriend, two more train gropings (and these are the highlight of the film), forced sex with the mistress and a stranger, and a sensual dream sequence. It's not like you're multi-tasking while waiting for the next naughty bit, they come (no pun implied) fast and vigorously.

The sex scenes are enjoyable and well-shot as well as numerous, the 2 female leads are attractive and have great bods, the camera lingers over the parts we came to see yet never seems sleazy, and downtime is minimal, as previously stated. (Read my reviews of the other 3 flicks for additional insight). If you're into Asian babes and soft-core flix that aren't so soft-core, this one's recommended - if not, how the hell did you end up here?",1333238400,73,2272,4.761421319796955

8504821,3,B006UV9LC6,"Alright, so... I was looking for a porn but what I got was less porn and more like a creepy stalker mystery movie. I watched the streamable version of Tokyo Train Girls 4 Young Wife's Desires, so I don't know if they censored it (some reviews say they do). In Prime version, there's not much sex, but there's a couple of boob shots.

The movie is ""Okay"" when you're in the mood for solving a mystery, but it's got so much stalker/stranger on a train molestation. I saw some reviews saying that people found that ""strangely arousing""... um, so, you find it arousing to sexually assault someone who clearly doesn't want it? Oh, and it ends on a cliffy, so you don't really get to solve the mystery entirely....
spoiler summary for the movie:
The movie does draw you in, though. Right away, the protagonist has problems. She's been assaulted on a train and her husband may be cheating on her. She tells someone who is presumably an old friend about being assaulted and he starts to follow her on the train each morning when he knows she's getting assaulted, and he beats up everyone who assaults her. She confronts the woman her husband is cheating on her with and doesn't believe the woman when the woman says there's nothing going on. Protagonist then goes to her old friend and rants about the issue, saying she needs to find out somehow if it's really true that they're having an affair. So, the old friend then stalks the woman who protagonist's husband is having an affair with. Stalker friend literally breaks into the woman's house and rapes her. Next, stalker friend finds the husband and becomes a killer friend (potentially). The protagonist finds out via phone call the next morning that her husband didn't show up to work. She calls her husband's mistress but gets no answer. She seems to realize that everything kept happening right after she told her old friend about things, and so she confronts him about it. He denies knowing where the husband is, but then claims that he told her she would always protect her no matter what. Then you see a flashback and you realize that the protagonist once had a relationship with the old friend. She soon calls the police department looking to talk to someone about the missing persons report she had filed off-screen and then the movie ends with her walking down the street. You don't get to find out what she does about the missing persons report, or if the husband is ever found, if the mistress survives the rape/assault, or if the old friend gets caught and arrested for his crimes. Other than being sexual suggestive, a couple shots of breasts, and panty fanservice shots, the movie isn't something anyone really can find sexually arousing, but it is good for a fan of horror/mystery/thriller movies, but prepare yourself for the cliffhanger ending.",1509062400,2,2807,4.705284552845528
