6444569,4,B00KRGYDE6,"Extensive research, full of little-known facts. The page turning gets a bit tedious, but the overall product is a superior one.",1422230400,6,127,5.095238095238095
8661000,4,B00KRGYDE6,"I really liked the format of the series, though a lot of people won't! If you're patient, there is a lot of good information here...but, you will have to ignore a lot of annoyance because of the narrator! I don't know if he didn't speak English and was speaking phonetically or they just decided to add a little weirdness to the production, but his pronunciation will get to you at some point. It's a very unique, and for the most part, Good presentation.",1531440000,,455,4.493975903614458

8661003,5,B00KRGYDE6,What I found unique and astounding about this product is  actually knowing something significant that took place every day in a war that took place over several years . If you watch movies and play video games and read books based on this war there is so much subject matter that this in itself is no small feat. Yes there are some mispronunciations but the amount of material that this has at least to me overshadows that,1512864000,,422,4.48051948051948
8661004,4,B00KRGYDE6,"Very, very long and very, very detailed.  It is a good look at the war, but I wish they had selected a narrator that could pronounce common words correctly.",1496620800,2,156,4.379310344827586

8661006,3,B00KRGYDE6,"(Viewed series on Amazon Prime) This is a great concept for a documentary.  The content is fascinating. The narration contains jarring mispronouncations, of even common words. The narrator apparently did not seek out correct pronunciation of unfamiliar words in preparation for taping this series. For example, he calls Admiral Doernitz, Admiral ""doughnuts"". If you are prepared to ignore these gaffes, this is an educational, and entertaining series. If you have a spouse like mine, who loudly and with irritation, corrects the narrator, you should probably give it a pass.",1474588800,3,574,5.449438202247191

8661009,5,B00KRGYDE6,"The title is so voluminous and contains so much information that is new to me, that it warrants a five star rating.  The prospective buyer, however, should be made aware of the set's strengths and weaknesses so the decision whether or not to buy it is an informed one.  This is a subjective matter, of course, and each person will have his or her own criteria for arriving at such.  That is, what is a strength for me, may be a shortcoming for another.  Here are mine.

Strengths:

Footage - Film footage from all theaters of battle, much of it new to me. Yes, there is some repetition of scenes in later episodes, but not to the point where I felt belabored by it.  I've viewed all the major and many of the minor WWII series and there was a huge amount of new material here for me.

Cost - Over 77 hours of WWII material at a cost of the low to mid $20 range is a bargain.  Assuming I watch one hour a day/7 days a week, it will take me 11 weeks to complete the set.  Another way of looking at it, on an hourly basis I have paid $20/(77X60), or less than 1/2 cent per minute.

Volume of information - I'm learning a great deal of information in relation to the day to day progress of the war, which sets created for a larger, more general audience, cannot treat of due to their more specialized purpose. Absolutely immense and staggering in its scope.

Script:  The script, in spite of the lackluster narration is solid, well written and packs in a veritable tsunami of information.  Now the

Weaknesses:

Narration - If you did not appreciate the oratorical ability of the narrator of the series ""Fight for Freedom: Major Battles of WWII"" and its predecessor ""The Dawn of War,"" take your cursor off the ""buy now"" button and surf elsewhere.  Whereas the malapropisms and mispronunciations aren't as egregiously rife and riotous as in the forementioned two series, they are present, and may occasion an irritable smile. The presentation is stolid and as emotionless as a wheelbarrow loaded with clay bricks.

Volume of information - Yes, I have listed this a both a strength and a weakness.  There is so much information that at times I glaze over and feel like a sub that spends too much time beneath the proverbial waves and must needs to come to the surface for some fresh air.  If you are looking to be captivated, look elsewhere.  If you seek facts - LOTS of facts and are less concerned with being entertained- you're in the right place. Think newspaper headlines with lots of accompanying video footage.

Format - Remember, this is a CHRONICLE.  The unvariegated format is a little tedious, but it's not a history and does what it does: relates facts and does not try to create interest.

Not being familiar with the weaponry or uniforms or WWII minutiae, I can't really say if any anachronisms or historical inaccuracies are present, but given the ambitiousness of the project I wouldn't be surprised if there are so.  The bottom line is that in spite of the shortcomings I see series as an indispensable part of my collection and as such recommend it.  Any university library should be in possession of some such.",1426118400,14,3123,4.542039355992844
