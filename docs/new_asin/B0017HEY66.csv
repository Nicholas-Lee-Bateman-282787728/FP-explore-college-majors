8266070,5,B0017HEY66,"Cocteau was a poet above all else.  His last film is his intentional swan song.  As a creative artist, he confronts his work and it confronts him.  Rather than being a complete ego trip, it is closer to what Fellini did in ""8 1/2"", a similar work of genius, where the soul is searched, a document is made with all the art and craft the director can bring, and audience be damned.  Or blessed, if they can appreciate it.  ""Testament of Orpheus"" is Cocteau's last will and we are the richer for it.",1323388800,10,496,4.290322580645161
