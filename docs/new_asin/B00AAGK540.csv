8549169,4,B00AAGK540,"I just finished doing the full 40 minute workout.  I wish I could have given this dvd 5 stars, because I really enjoy Tanja Djelevic.  What I liked about this workout was 1)Tanja's effervescent personality - she makes you want to exercise, 2) several of her moves are different than others I have seen, 3) it is an excellent full body workout.  What I don't like is 1) on the cardio portion, which is repeated several times, the moves are all the same, and this makes it somewhat boring, 2)  when she says ""right"" or ""left"" she is referring to herself, and it will be the opposite for you. So, I don't regret buying this workout.  I love working out with a stability ball and have almost all the dvd's available, keeping in mind that there aren't many more being made.  However, due to the repetitive factor of the cardio segments, I have a feeling that I won't be doing this dvd all that often.",1491350400,,895,4.393939393939394
