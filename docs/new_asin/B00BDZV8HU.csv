8566826,4,B00BDZV8HU,"I was very skeptical when I started watching this series but I've grown to really like it. Does it live up to the original movie? No, absolutely not. But I still enjoy it and I've even gotten a few laughs out of the show. The voice acting is very good and the animation is better in the second season. My only gripe is that it can be real cheesy at times but overall I like the show. Four stars.",1433808000,,395,4.012658227848101
