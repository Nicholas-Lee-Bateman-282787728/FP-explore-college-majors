5715518,5,B00CCQZG9A,"If quality of image is what you want, especially,"" Hawaiian footage"" then this is a no brainer if they shot the most right content.  Hawaii is all about the beauty of nature and if this captures that then it is a winner.  Jury is still out on the scenes chosen to be included.

A few Hawaii Blu-Rays have poorly chosen scenes.  Most are excellent.",1412208000,2,347,4.375

5715520,3,B00CCQZG9A,"As far as 4K, there has been plenty of material recorded in 4K, 5K downsampled to 1080P, so nothing unusual.
About excellent color, Blu_ray native encoding mandates 8 bits per color, meaning about 16 million colors, when many screens are capable of 10bpc (1.07 billion colors), so if you worry about gradients and color accuracy, beware.
8K has been demonstrated in 2005 and about to enter the market soon, with panels like BOE after it was flooded with inexpensive 4K since early last year.",1388707200,12,491,4.857142857142857

5715542,2,B00CCQZG9A,"I pre-ordered this disk, and have been looking forward to it. The aquarium is phenomenal, and the fish are gorgeous. Unfortunately 80% of it is significantly out of focus 100% of the time. It appears to have been shot at f1.8 or so, and it should have had a lot more light and shot at f16. Such a disappointment. Everything was spot on but the depth of field. sigh",1427673600,6,364,4.2898550724637685
5715543,2,B00CCQZG9A,"Firstly, I am from England and my wife and myself have visited Yellowstone NP 3 times and have spent around ten weeks in the park.
We are extremely disappointed with this blu ray.
We have waited nearly a year for it to be delivered although Amazon did keep us informed and this review is nothing to do with Amazon, but the makers of the blu ray. The first schoolboy error made in the film is the commentator quite clearly says in the first few minutes that Yellowstone is found in the North East corner of Wyoming. Even from England we know Yellowstone is situated in the North WEST corner of Wyoming. The first 25 minutes of the film is all about mud pots and blow holes and some are shown for several minutes, too boring, we want to show our grand children this dvd and they will get bored too quickly.
They don't show Old Faithful nor Grand Prismatic at all ! They do not show the Sylvan Pass nor any of the villages within the park. Animals, which is what we hoped to see, well loads of bison and elk and that's about it.
One more terrible error, they showed what they said was a Grizzly bear with her two cubs. I am certain that the bear was in fact a Black bear as it had no hump whatsoever, it was black, although I know some Grizzlies can be very dark, but more importantly, this bear along with her cubs is seen almost running up a tree. I didn't think grizzly bears climbed trees as they don't have the right shaped claws to climb whereas a black bear has shorter and sharper claws. Yo will need to watch this blu ray yourselves to see if I am correct of not.
There is a grizzly on the outer cover, but alas, not in the film.  The picture quality of the 4k blu ray is superb and the sound is find although a big over powering. I love the Native Indian drums. !  The BBC here in England made a long documentary on Yellowstone a few years ago in full HD and I give them five stars, but this DVD I can only give two stars for picture quality only and the fact I only paid 10 ($15)

Thank you !",1427673600,13,2000,4.123076923076923
5715544,5,B00CCQZG9A,great picher and sound picher clear a lot of detale sreat coler i like this kind of stuff  you can tell the differns between filmed in  4k and mastered in 4k the filmed in 4k  has more detail,1427587200,,191,3.973684210526316
5715545,1,B00CCQZG9A,"Very disappointed in this Blu-Ray. Not at all what I expected, or wanted. The video quality is ok but the subject is not. Should have read reviews more closely. A lot of rocks and lava but not what I expected Hawaii to look like. If this is really what Hawaii look like I would not like to visit.",1427500800,2,296,4.120689655172414
5715546,5,B00CCQZG9A,Well done the colors were fantastic. Also enjoyed the history of the islands,1427155200,,76,4.923076923076923

5715548,2,B00CCQZG9A,"Rather average in terms of content and picture quality. Regarding the latter, even though it is said to have been filmed in 4K, the picture quality is no better than normal Blueray. I have seen some demonstration 4K, and this product does not even come close to it. Even the so called ""Mastered in 4K"" products, that I have seen, are not 4K quality, and this is about the same.",1425340800,,377,4.4
5715549,2,B00CCQZG9A,I returned this dvd because in my opinion it showed mostly the trees and forests It should of shown more of  Hawaii and to charge S9.00 for restocking  when I returned it is rediculous.,1424563200,,185,4.411764705882353
5715550,3,B00CCQZG9A,"First let's talk about the PROS:  Some of the shots are great and show off pretty areas of the park, like lower falls.  99% of the shots are in focus, and the coloring is decent, although the blacks and whites have minor color casts in a few shots.  There are some up close and personal shots of wildlife, which is nice- but those are the only appropriate close-ups (see below). The narration sounds okay and is somewhat informative.

CONS: This BluRay may put you to sleep.  Very slow pacing, which is okay in a nature presentation, but this is a little too slow for my taste. It feels like the editor didn't have enough footage to fill an hour, or was just lazy.  The music has a native American flair, which I like, but is repetitive and almost too calming.  There are too many close-up shots of rivers flowing and lakes lapping water. C'mon, show us one of the most amazing parks in existence, not close-ups of pine cones and water splashing.  This presentation really lacks the majestic scale of Yellowstone, but there are some exceptions as stated above.

Overall, this is a somewhat pretty BluRay that was shot in 4k and downsampled to 1080p HD. It's a decent diversion if it ever comes down in price to oh, say, $5 - $8, but at $14 it's asking too much for the little effort that was put into it.  This is not on par with BBC, Discovery, or other nature channels, but they are asking the same kind of prices.  Seems like the creators were looking at an easy cash grab, while deciding to at least shoot in 4k, although that's a small part in making a good presentation.",1424304000,3,1576,4.418685121107266
5715551,1,B00CCQZG9A,"While some of the shots were pretty, after a while it all looked the same. Everything was a long shot from a helicopter, which almost negates having used a high def camera. We never made it through the whole disc, but by the time we left off, we had yet to see any detailed close up shot of anything except one moderately close turtle shot.

The music is HORRIBLE. It does absolutely nothing to make you feel like it's Hawaii you're watching.

The narration was so so. Some interesting facts here and there, but the awful music detracted from it all.

Poor cinematography (you can see reflections in the helicopter window), terrible choice of shots, unbelievably poor background music, and virtually nothing recognizable from any visits I've had there. This was a complete waste of money. Do not waste your time.",1424044800,7,812,4.74468085106383
5715552,3,B00CCQZG9A,I thought it would have astonishing 4k images but since it is delivered in a normal blu ray disc it only reaches 1920x1200 resolution. However it shows spectacular vistas.,1423872000,,171,4.931034482758621
5715553,1,B00CCQZG9A,We were expecting so much more from this DVD.  The quality was supposed to be mastered in 4K and did not even look as good as HD.  It appeared to be repeating the same thing over and over again.  I have recorded better video with my own camera in Hawaii.  I wouldn't recommend buying this video.,1423267200,5,295,4.214285714285714
5715554,1,B00CCQZG9A,"I don't think the creators understand why people buy Hawaii DVDs/Blu-Rays. At the very least, they certainly don't understand why I buy them. I buy them to remind me of when I was there, and get me into a Hawaii mindset. This video could not be farther from that goal.

There are a few impressive shots, but not many. Often times you can see a slight reflection on the helicopter window that the camera was facing. It makes me wonder if they put an expensive camera on a standard charter ride. The interlacing and abrupt transitions made the video seem jerky, and amateurish. The narration was OK, but there is one spot where it cuts off mid sentence. The music is unbelievable... as in ""how could anybody believe this would be a good fit?"" It would be perfect if the title was ""1940s Germany Invades Hawaii"". There are a number of very strange selections, that repeat, but one has organ music. Seriously? Organs and Hawaii? There is not one piece of Hawaiian music. And, shots of Hawaiian geese and lava flows take up probably half of the film. If you want poorly filmed shots of lava and geese, set to organ music, then this is the video you've been waiting for.

It is really sad, because I was pretty excited about this Blu-Ray. The delays in release concerned me, but I convinced myself that they would make it all the more amazing. Quite the contrary. These people didn't know what they were doing, that was the cause of the delay, and it is reflected in the film. I buy these films to watch with my family, but primarily my mom - who loves Hawaii but will likely never go again. It doesn't take much to make her swoon. It left all of us with a ""what the heck were they thinking"" look on our face.

I wish I could get my money back. And, I could, but not without making Amazon pay for my mistake in buying this film. I don't often leave reviews, but I'm doing so in this case for your sake. Stay away from this film.",1423180800,15,1922,4.348189415041783
5715555,1,B00CCQZG9A,"constant viewing of plain lava covered ground for majority of film.  poor narration, annoying constant music background unbefitting the cameras view.

5715556,3,B00CCQZG9A,"This long awaited production has finally arrived.

It includes nice scenery, primarily of the Big Island and Kauai.

The case indicates that it is presented in 1080i, which offsets potential benefits of having been shot in 4K.

Some of the footage appears to be shown in slow motion, which serves little purpose and creates a sense of boredom.

The definition of the production is inferior to other available blu-ray productions of Hawaii.

I do enjoy the extensive footage of Kauai.  The production appears to jump from one island to another then back.

I'm looking forward to reading other customer reviews now that the production has been released.  I'm torn between a two or three star rating.",1423094400,3,697,4.948275862068965
