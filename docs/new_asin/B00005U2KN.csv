1663520,5,B00005U2KN,"BBS surely has outdone itself again in Walking With Prehistoric Beasts, the followup to the Walking With Dinasours series.  Just like WWD, it uses computer generated graphcis and other special effects along with real environements.  It may not look as good as Jurrassic Park, but surely is close enough.  The material is well written and organized.  Too all dinasour fans, there are other hugh ancient beasts on earth and you will see them all in this DVD.  It is highly educational and entertaining and will be a treasured DVD set for anyone to own.",1013558400,,550,4.808510638297872
1663521,4,B00005U2KN,"I didn't watch the Discovery Channel presentation of ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"" because their visual trick of interrupting the story with ""scientific tidbits"" drives me crazy.  Instead I waited for the video, which I hoped would be in the BBC style (just the story, no talking heads).  Imagine my surprise when the video version WAS the Discovery Channel version, not the BBC version.  Thankfully, the DVD is the BBC version - complete with Kenneth Brannagh narration - with the option of seeing the other [stuff] if you want it.
I'd give the DVD 5 stars instead of 4 if I didn't have any issues with the production quality.  (Actually I'd give the DVD 4 and 1/2 stars, but the rating system here doesn't allow for half stars.) The production values of ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" were so good that most of the time it looked like I was watching a documentary on dinosaurs, filmed with living dinosaurs.  ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"" looked a little more to me like puppets/animatronics than did ""Dinosaurs"" however, hence the slightly lower score.  It's still well worth owning, very minor flaws and all.
Now what I really want to see from the BBC/Discovery Channel partnership is a series about the time before the dinosaurs, which I guess is early-mid Paleozoic Era.  That would be way cool.",1013472000,2,1303,4.8954545454545455
1663522,5,B00005U2KN,"I've been a prehistory fan for some time now and all of the BBC/Discovery documenteries have been great but the ""Walking with"" series is just fantastic! Sure, some of what they make sound as fact is really only speculation but that is expected. I own all of the ""Walking with"" DVDs available and have watched each one of them at least 4-5 times. Certainly worth the purchase for anyone with even the slightest interest in prehistory, dinosaurs or even just the excellent special effects.",1010188800,5,487,4.809523809523809
1663523,5,B00005U2KN,"Probably the best documentary I have ever seen, along with Walking with Dinosaurs. The animation was spectacular,like its predecessors. But there were two faults. I noticed that very often you see the same shot 2 or 3 times. I personaly think thats cheating. Also, when it aired on the Discovery Channel, It was over an hour shorter than WWD, partialy due to the short ""Fact"" sections. I havnt seen it on home video, but with Christmas and my birthday approaching I might get it. Maybe these problems will be fixed. Even if they arent, it is definatly a 5 star program that I strongly request, especialy if yu are a prehistory lover like me.",1008806400,5,641,4.631578947368421
1663524,4,B00005U2KN,"Yeah, BBC still know how to make a killer prehistoric animal documentary.  I found this show to be very interesting and for the most part very well researched.  The CGI effects are amazing, but at times you can still tell it's artificial.  Not enough to effect the rating, though.  The animals are awesome.  I loved the basilosaurus.  They also did a good job telling the story of our early ancestors.  My dad's a christian, and I almost luaghed ou loud at the look on his face when they went into detail about the man-apes.
I took a star off the rating for something that will probably only bother me.  The terror birds, a subject I happen to be very interested in, could have been done better.  The gastornis was alright except for it's lacking of arms, which is a fairly recent discovery, but the titanis birds near the end were very poorly portrayed.  The neck was far too long and the body too small.  Also, the birds are shown as pitiful scavengers being terrorized by the sabretooths.  Hahaha.  Don't hold your breath.  Again, these birds were lacking their arms.
But if you're like most people and don't know a terror bird from a tweety bird, then this show is the perfect documentary on ice-age animals and men.",1008115200,,1220,4.56221198156682
1663525,5,B00005U2KN,"WOW!! This is one of the most amazing documentaries on prehistoric life I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot of documentaries on prehistoric life)!
Walking With Prehistoric Beasts starts off 50 million years ago, just a few million years after the extincion of the dinosaurs.  In the beginning of the show, the narrator introduces the small mammal called Leptictidium, a swift six foot tall bird called Gastronis, and other beasts.  after on, the documentary shows a primitive whale that was 30 tons and four times the length of a great white shark, the planet's largest predatory land mammal (which is interestingly enough related to ungulates like sheep and goats), a two story tall rhino which was the largest land mammal ever on earth, a nasty scavenging hog (one of the most fearsome and ugly creatures in the show), and several other weird, fearsome, and magnificent beasts that once ruled the earth.  Later in the documentary, the ice age comes, as well as an amazing and somewhat hairless ape... Man.
I could go on and on talking about this show, but I won't :-). Let me sumarise this amazing five star documentary to you, the reader, in three words: BUY IT NOW!!",1008028800,38,1170,4.782178217821782

1663561,3,B00005U2KN,"The 'Walking With Dinosaurs' producers here decided to venture into the Age of Mammals. Most of the CGI work here is pretty good, but the creators of this particular series have one major issue to overcome: We know how mammals move and what they basically look like, while most of what we know about dinosaurs is speculation. We, for instance, have modern big cats like tigers and lions to compare with 'Beasts' representation of Smilodon (aka saber tooth cat). We also know how modern humans and the Great Apes (bonobo, chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan) move and behave. This series isn't very good with either; the cats look stiff and inflexible, and the protohumans aren't realistic. Only recently has CGI begun to do a good job with big cats on film--the tiger in 'Life of Pi' is a good example--so perhaps the SFX people on this series bit off more than they could chew.",1474329600,2,876,4.73202614379085

Otherwise, the graphics are amazing (with very few moments of, ""oh, that's CGI, fer sure...!"") and the hard science is nicely mixed into the script so as to leave you realizing you just learned something *after* you've enjoyed the show. The only real negative is that (for me) they went a little overboard sometimes on personalizing -- almost humanizing -- some of the main ""stars"" of each episode, and there were a couple of times I had to wonder ""do they REALLY know that?"" -- the two points that cost it about a half star in my rating -- but all in all it's well worth the watching!",1406505600,,766,4.517985611510792

1663735,4,B00005U2KN,"This show is about the animals that appeared on the earth after the mass extinction of the dinosaurs.  In school, and even later in life, I learned about the dinosaurs.  After the dinosaurs, most tales tend to jump right to the mammals, then spring forward to more modern times.  This show is different.  It spends time on the... hmm... I guess you could all it ""intermediate"" period where the dinosaurs are gone and other species arise.  As far as learning something... I'd never heard of an indricotherium.  Now I know what it is/was and am fascinated.

I gave this four stars mainly because the animation leaves a bit to be desired and some of the episodes were a bit ""run on"".  Other than that I've found it pretty darn interesting most of the time.  What I consider ""run on"" is when the dialog stuck with one scenario past the point of interest.  Some of it is obviously contrived, playing on heart-strings rather than being entirely factual, but that's all part of the show, right? :)",1403481600,,990,4.605714285714286

True, no one knows exactly what an allosaurus really looked, but lets give the producers credit for doing their best. If I have one small criticism, it is this: conjecture is sometimes presented as fact.

1663972,1,B00005U2KN,"This is the absolute WORST set of documentary shows I've EVER seen.  Not only is it based on VERY OLD scientific theories that have since been scientifically proven to be COMPLETELY WRONG, but much of it is just someone's imagination gone wild.  It claims things as fact that have either no basis in fact today because it's been disproven (such as macro-evolution--one type of an animal turning into a completely different type of an animal--AND--the old ""humans came from a monkey type of creature""--which have BOTH now been PROVEN TO NEVER have happened); and things that they couldn't possibly know unless one of them actually LIVED in these time periods; which of course, they didn't, so they're just GUESSING at alot of this stuff and presenting it as fact.  It amazes me that people actually used to believe this stuff and that there are still so many people today (who obviously DON'T keep up with the latest scientific discoveries) that actually still DO believe this stuff simply because they were taught in school that this stuff was fact and not the THEORY that it was.

So-called documentaries like this will go down in history showing how LITTLE common sense this generation of supposed ""scientists"" actually had....I'm sure people of the future will look back on documentaries like this and think to themselves that we must have been a very ignorant people; and actually, many people and many scientists today are already thinking this, myself included...luckily for us, we are FINALLY coming out of the DARK AGES OF SCIENCE and have started to actually do REAL science (meaning testable and repeatable experiments that give us REAL RESULTS AND REAL ANSWERS; as opposed to the guessing games and putting THEORY forth as FACT as has been done for so many years now).  Plus, we know so much more today about the genome, DNA, etc.; that the theories behind documentaries such as this one have been blown out of the water.  I can only tell you that if you want to see what NEVER happened or if you just really like science fiction, then you might like these shows for the graphics and absolute laughable story-lines.  It has however, absolutely ""NO"" BASIS IN FACT, and is a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME if you actually want to LEARN something.

IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT ""REAL"" SCIENTISTS HAVE LEARNED and what we've discovered to date, I would suggest documentaries such as ""Signature In The Cell"" by Dr. Stephen Meyer, ""Programming Of Life"" by Dr. Don Johnson, ""A Question Of Origins"", ""Set In Stone"", ""Darwin's Dilemma"", ""The Privileged Planet"", ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life"", and ""Icons Of Evolution"".  That should be a good start anyway.  There's so much that's been learned over the past 20 years alone that it's really a bit overwhelming, but highly worth checking out for those with curious minds who like to learn and know the truth of things.  The evidence and answers are out there, you just need to check it out; and it's never been easier to learn all the great and amazing discoveries that have come to pass in such a short span of time.  The internet makes it easy along with being able to rent and watch documentaries online at one's own convenience.  Many of these newest discoveries are already out on DVD, can be rented or watched online for free; not to mention, how easy it is to listen to debates or interviews about the latest discoveries.

1663978,4,B00005U2KN,"Lacking cable, I was unable to see ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"" when it premiered on the Discovery Channel. Therefore, I had to wait impatiently until February 2002 to purchase the DVD set. My anxious wait was not in vain. ""Prehistoric Beasts"" is awe-inspiring, provocative, informative, and ambitious, very nearly the equal of its precedessor ""Walking with Dinosaurs"". The scientific knowledge, care, production, and preparation the BBC crew expended on this program was well invested and deeply appreciated, at least by this paleontology buff. I've watched the ""episode"" DVD and ""making of"" DVD at least three times already. I will never get tired of it.

Why a shade below ""Dinosaurs""? Well, dinosaurs have a unique marquee appeal all their own - they are truly exotic, mysterious, and alien. While the creatures featured in ""Beasts"" were all special and impressive - from the forest ants and hopping Leptictidium to the titanic Indricotherium and Basilosaurus - they're still just a teeny bit too familiar. Nonetheless, I relished all six episodes for their professionalism, information, and naturalism (except for some self-conscious camera work, as for example when the indricothere calf knocks over a camera and a mammoth sprays mud on another one - which I actually found amusing). The CGI and animatronic work was phenomenal for the most part, especially in the mammoth sequences - they seemed just like living hairy elephants. Only some of the renditions - like the Smilodon kittens and a couple of the Australopithecines- seemed just a tad artificial. But that is definitely a minor quibble. Also, digitizing out the mating Australopithecines was a bit distracting. As with the mating stegosaurs in ""When Dinosaurs Roamed America"", they should have just cut away before the deed was consummated.

My favorite episodes were the ""indricothere"" and ""woolly mammoth"" ones, because I am a sucker for giant mammals (megafauna). It's a shame these creatures aren't still with us. Some, like the megatherium, doedicurus, and mammoth, were alive only a few thousand years ago!

To those who did not enjoy the ""Walking.."" series because it is based on speculation and conjecture, I say, suspend your disbelief and savor the daring and original attempts to re-create a lost world based on the most up-to-date information. It is so well-rendered that if it didn't actually occur that way eons ago, it should have!

Again, kudos to the BBC for both ""Walking.."" series and their accompanying books (which I also own). I recommend they continue this paleontological quest; they are many more prehistoric beasts to feature!

I also love random facts, such as the speed of ketchup or how the sewer system was made in the US.  This series marries my two loves and succeeds wildly.

This series captures the excitement of these random animals and time periods that aren't hugely popular like the dinosaurs.  The each episode was a mini story, making it more interesting than a straight documentary.  In addition, each episode touched on time periods, animals and facts you might never had thought about.

Walking with Prehistoric Beasts I found even more interesting than Walking with Dinosaurs.  Maybe I just relate to mammals more because, hey, I am one.  But I found there was something about my favorite episodes that i found really compelling: the story about the mammoth migration was truly epic and heroic, the tale of human ancestors was moving, and the story of Half-Tooth the sabre tooth cat (set in an exotic South America) was incredible.

The computer animation is top rate, but some sequences still don't appear very realistic such as the herd of wooly mammoths being forced off a cliff by a group of Neanderthals. As for the Neanderthals, they seem a bit too much of the caveman cliche. I saw a model recreation at a museum recently that suggests that Neanderthals brow ridge features and noses were much less exagerrated than what is shown here. But these are minor quibbles.

1664090,4,B00005U2KN,"Walking with Prehistoric Beasts is an interesting series for lovers of natural history.
One would think that someone who does Shakespeare well should be able to get a nature show narration right, but it's obvious that paleozoology isn't Kenneth Branagh's passion, and both here and in Walking with Dinosaurs one sometimes hears that he is reading a badly-rehearsed (and occasionally poorly-written) script. Sir David Attenborough with his authority and enthusiasm would have been perfect for the job, and I was a bit surprised that such a major BBC fronting didn't feature his legendary voice and employed his singular talent in writing nature show narrations.
That aside, I enjoyed it both visually and from the educational point of view, even more so than Walking with Dinosaurs as this is a period of time that we, due to the dino craze, have heard far too little about in the major public channels before (would a film called Eocene Park be a great hit?).
I particularly enjoyed learning more about the origin of whales with the incorporation of the recent fossil findings of the ambulocetus.

1664091,5,B00005U2KN,"I really LOVED  ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts,"" and cannot recommend this documentary enough! This show will appeal to fans of nature documentaries who would like to view a  researched but (fictional) account of the lives of ancient mammals. This series starts off at about 65 million years ago with the demise of the dinosaurs, and ends about 30 million years ago, with the demise of the Neanderthals. The animation and animatronics are so well done, so detailed that at times I forgot I was watching computer animation and animatronics. In particular, I loved the scenes with the saber-toothed cats, the hyeanadons and the ancient whales. Oh, and who can forget the andrewsarchus?
The narrator does an excellent job of describing each era, the animal life, the flora and fauna, and the climate change and how it impacts the animal populace. Creatures spring to life on the screen eating, drinking, fighting, dying, and yes even (mating).
Caveats: First: I  wish the documentary  had gone into a bit more detail with early homo sapiens and Neanderthals. I felt the impact of these early humans on their environment wasn't fully explored. Second: About the only scenes I saw where the animation was left than perfect, was where/when the animals fed. The chewing and eating motions didn't seem quite right. The early chimp-like humans were picking nits. But the nits never seemed to quite make it INTO the mouths. Etc.
Finally, one word of caution, while this did not bother me, some sensitive viewers and young children, might have trouble with repeat scenes of graphic violence, and animal death. Even though its animation, it is very realistically portrayed and no punches are pulled. This is not a movie intended for young children( although mature  children will love it). As an example: my mother was quite distressed at the scene in the beginning where the trapped baby chick was being devoured alive by the giant ants (!) As a result, she refused to watch anymore.
Overall, an excellent film, sure to delight those who enjoy speculating on what things were like in the world of prehistory.",1055376000,5,2099,4.968660968660969
1664092,5,B00005U2KN,"With the enormous success of ""Walking with Dinosaurs"", it was only natural that Framestore and the BBC would follow-up that series with the age after the dinosaurs.  ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"" is that series.  In fact, this is the series that Executive Producer Tim Haines wanted to do, even more than ""Walking with Dinosaurs"".
My first experience with this series was in London with the episode ""Whale Killer"".  I knew then that this was something I wanted to see when it came across the ""pond"", and it was something I wanted to buy.  It was a little disappointing that Stockard Channing, not Avery Brooks, narrated the Discovery Channel version, but she does a fair job.  However, one would be better off buying the video version than taping the series off Discovery.
The video version is the original version that aired in the UK, with Kenneth Branagh's original narration.  As with ""Walking with Dinosaurs"", Branagh's narration is greatly superior to Channing or Brooks', though one has to remember that Branagh isn't working with a script written for a version that is chopped up to accomidate the slighty stricter US censors and commercial time.  And the video has the *complete*, uncut episodes from the original BBC airing.  The animation continues from ""Dinosaurs"" and appears just as realistic, despite the added difficulty of rendering fur and feathers!
Although this is a excellent series, there are certain flaws that prevent the series from getting five stars.  The animatronics continue to be, IMHO, of a lesser quality than the animation; they still look like rubber puppets.  This is perhaps at it's most glaring in the fourth episode, with the early humans.  The humans in that episode, despite more than adequate animation, just don't ""feel"" real, either animated or animatrionic.  In fact, in my opinion, the primates featured in this series look more like animated characters than real animals.  Only the Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon humans have any semblance of realism, and only because they are portrayed by actors.
The extras featured in the DVD make this series even more worthwhile.  Included on the second disc are the two ""Making of..."" hour-long episodes.  Also on the disc are interviews with the creators of the series, stats on the animals featured in the series, and various images of the animals.
All in all, ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"" is an excellent follow-up to ""Dinosaurs"", despite the technical flaws.  Once again, Tim Haines proves why Framestore is to televison what Industrial Light and Magic is to movies.  I hope that Haines and company will follow up this series with episodes of the animals from *before* the age of dinosaurs, though, from the previews I've seen, I hold no hope for ""Walking with Cavemen""!",1055289600,4,2765,5.068432671081678

You get the same fascinating computer animated and animatronic reconstructions, though in this case of course they are of early mammalian life, just a great show to watch and imagine what might have been. One thing I remember in particular was a shot in which a group of primitive proto-humans (ausralopithicines?) walk past the camera, the producers actually thought to include the detail of one of them kicking up a stone as they passed the camera. That stone flew right at the lens and cracked it, just like it would have done had this really been filmed back in the past. I love seeing that kind of detail.",1036454400,3,688,4.694214876033058

First let me say that I am glad there are those out there who like to treat the portayal of prehistoric beasts seriously and not as Disney talking characters or Jurassic Park man-eating monsters. The documentary style of Prehistoric Beasts attests to how much the filmmakers value the paleontological finds of recent years. Now is the film %100 accurate in every aspect? No. Is every animated frame perfect with regards to special FX? not really.  But as a whole it is a wonderfull learning and entertaining piece.  The scenes with the giant rhino ancestors are awe-inspiring.  The saber tooth cat comes to life like never before, and of course you have the famous mammoths stumping around the prehistoric badlands.

1664122,5,B00005U2KN,"Before I say anything else -- please don't forget to look at my recommendations for further learning, toward the bottom of my review.
This fascinating set of short films walks the viewer through animal evolution since the days of the dinosaur, and helps provide a sense of the appearance of some of the more interesting of the bygone creatures, long since left in evolution's ancient wake.  We meet bird-sized horses, horse-sized birds, flabbergastingly colossal proto-whales, and pre-human hominids galore.
The computerized animation is just unbelievable.  (I mean that in a good way).  Each animal has its own individual style of movement -- I can't even imagine how much time must have gone into developing the algorithms defining how these complex images move.
An interesting feature of these films, is their stress on story-telling as a teaching device.  Many people's eyes glaze over reflexively, whenever statistics rear their ugly heads.  To offset this admittedly widespread tendency, the filmmakers here have constructed short storylines for each little film. These stories are roughly equivalent to a sitcom in terms of complexity, although certainly not in content!  (A sitcom where a third to half of the characters are gorily slain in every episode?  I just can't picture it.)  What I mean in comparing the storylines to a sitcom is that there are a few ""main character"" amimals, faced with a few specific problems (mating, eating, not being eaten, etc.)  We follow the odyssey of each creature as it warily makes its way through its own episode, cheering when it overcomes obstacles, and feeling for it when things don't work out.  Also like a sitcom, there are often subplots that dovetail interestingly with the main story.  Again, however, these films are not like episodes of ""Frasier.""  The law of the jungle prevails, very frighteningly, in these often brutal films.
If you appreciate learning about this general topic, I would really like to recommend a few books for you to look at.  If you know a science teacher, and you'd like a hard copy of the kind of discussions embodied in this fine film, then I'd like to strongly urge that you try to track down a copy of ""Our Continent: A Natural History of North America,"" published by National Geographic.  ""Our Continent"" is good because it shows you how to actually SPELL the baroque, unnecessarily latinate names of all these long-lost critters.  More importantly, it includes a number of really nice evolutionary development charts.  The charts allow you to view chronological cross-sections, of various branches of the family tree of all Earthly lifeforms.  The drawings of the branches are peopled with illustrations of the creatures in question, at various stages in their evolutionary processes.  For example, following a single branch along, from left to right, you can see the Basilosaurus develop into the Physeter, and subsequently into our friend, the noble whale...
If you are a parent who wishes to share your interest in prehistoric beasts with your children, or (probably even more likely) vice versa, try reading ""How to Talk Dinosaur with Your Child,"" by Querida L. Pearce.  If you are transfixed by the concept of evolutionary adaptations to sudden, violent climate changes, which are often alluded to in these films, then you may wish to check out ""A Brain for All Seasons: Human Evolution and Abrupt Climate Change,"" by William Calvin.  Finally, if you'd like to see a highly imaginative, fascinating series of artist's speculations, dealing with how animal life might evolve in future millenia, I'd like to recommend that you look at ""After Man: A Zoology of the Future,"" by Dougal Dixon.
Anyway -- this DVD rocks.  Two thumbs way up.",1027555200,2,3726,5.085385878489327
1664123,5,B00005U2KN,"Little have been said about prehistoric beasts. Other than the famous Mammoths, mention Basilosaurus or maybe Gastronis to anyone, and they will throw you a blank stare. Almost everyone relates prehistory to the age of the dinosaurs, however, this documentary is about to change all that. Its producer Jasper James (Tim Haines is the excutive producer this time) once said that he hopes that this series would induce people to take notice of prehistoric beasts. You know what? I think he succeeded quite well.
Beautifully crafted, this documentary packs a big punch. Narrated by Kenneth Branaugh, whose monotonous voice is excellent throughout the show can be described as, humourous, majestic and emotional at times, this documentary will hardly put you to sleep. With graphical improvements, this documentary takes viewers back to the age of prehistoric beasts, with its abosrbing storylines. The first episode takes viewers back to Germany, where they witness how vurnerable life can be, as they see a new born Gastronis chick being devoured by giant ants. Episode two throws viewers into the ocean, in the midst of the upcoming El Nino, and viewers themselves get to witness how harsh life could be on a pregnant prehistoric whale.
Another factor that makes this documentary so much more interesting, is the cliches thrown in, not present in any other documentary. We see spectacular Matrix effects, viewers themselves will be 'attacked' by the creatures, as the camera is pushed at, splashed at, pelted at, and even rammed at !( which will literally send you 'tumbling' )
Overall, this is a great DVD set to buy, the second disk will only interest those who want to find out more about the beasts, read the storyboards, go behind the scenes, or watch the trailers.",1027468800,,1769,5.061643835616438
1664124,5,B00005U2KN,"The team at the BBC got it right-there is another series of invigorating 'big animal' natural history stories AFTER the dinosaurs went extinct-the radiation and development of the mammals.
This DVD series covers the early expansion of mammals into vacant ecological niches left by the disappearance of (most) of the dinosaurs-from early cat-size horse ancestors, to big carnivourous flightless birds, to giants in the sea (carnivorous whales 18m long), to giants on the plains-eg rhinos trying to be giraffes (up to 6m at the shoulder), elephant ancestors (up to 4m at the shoulder), giant pig-like ancestors, giant carnivorous hoofed animals (Andrewsarchus-about 2m at the shoulder), the sabre tooth cats (smilodon-about 1.2m at the shoulder-bigger than the modern tiger), upright small primates wandering the African plains (australopithecus-about 1.4m at the shoulder), mammoths (about 3m at the shoulder) and eventually a 'big' primate-man (about 1.7m at the shoulder).
There are two DVDs in the set, 1)-the 6 part series, and 2) 2 40 minute-long documentaries, which for those who want deeper analysis, are better than the series. These documentaries take us to the famous fossil site of Messel in Germany, the Sahara desert, Ethiopia, South Africa, and various other locales, with background rationale explained as to various aspects of the series. Most of the stories are indeed based on scientific research-for example the lake beds at the famous fossil site of Messel in Germany appear to have been anoxic-and there is evidence of sudden unusual extinctions which have been surmised to be due to mass releases of carbon dioxide (episode 1). Other examples are leopard teeth marks found in skulls of australopithecus-(episode 4), mammoth kill sites adjacent to ancient cliffs (episode 6), impact injuries in Neanderthal skeletons (episode 6), and exposed fossil mangrove roots in the Sahara desert (episode 2). This sort of background information is essential for a deeper analysis of many of the stories in the main series, and provide good information for the enthusiastic amateur palaeontologist.
This is a wonderful 65 million year story, which has been somewhat neglected during the modern science era, and this series attempts to fill in many gaps for the wonder and scientific endeavour of the chattering and lumbering primates who eventually came down from the trees.
The BBC has left some significant Quaternary and Recent megafaunal extinctions out, in such places as Madagascar, Australia (eg diprotodon, megalania), New Zealand (eg the moa), and other places, so I hope they will visit these places in another series!",1026518400,7,2637,5.387409200968523
1664125,5,B00005U2KN,"The Walking with Dinosaurs team could probably have contented itself with producing spinoffs for a long time. They made one special -- ""Allosaurus"" -- which basically seems to be a seventh episode that didn't get included in the earlier series. If they went on producing half-hour dinosaur shows for years, they'd have had me for an audience.
They didn't do that, though. Instead they traded on their success with dinos to make this great series about prehistoric animals after the dinosaurs. One of the producers mentions, in the ""making of"" documentary on disk two, that they knew they'd have to do the dinosaurs first because those were popular enough to draw money and attention. They seem to have made ""Beasts"" because they were just plain interested. Thank goodness someone's letting curiosity drive the work, you know?
This series works a lot like ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" did. There are six episodes, and each one's a storyline involving a particular species of animal and the world in which it lives. There's no ""talking head"" side to these shows; they're nonstop film of the (animated) animals living in their worlds, without other graphics. Kenneth Branagh narrates them very much like any other animal documentary, only you're seeing reconstructions of extinct animals instead of lions or elephants. The camera work is skilfully made to work like shots from modern nature shows, with a few minor conceits from the cgi animators thrown in for fun.
The ""Walking"" team really raised the bar for themselves here, though. First, for some reason prehistoric mammals don't knock people out the way dinosaurs do. A couple of years ago a Japanese team announced it was trying to produce a real, live mammoth, but nobody's making movies in which a series of ... scientists get lured out to an island for mammoths to stomp on them, you know? Then too, people know how a lion or tiger looks when it moves, so animating a saber toothed cat is going to be harder to pull off, leaving alone the primates. Also, and it's a simple thing, mammals have hair, which is hard to make right on a computer.
Well, it works again. The shows are wonderfully written, with an extremely good sense of timing and a nice range to each episode. The animals are stunning. Seeing a brontotherium browsing the shrubs is just dazzling. There's almost more evolutionary interest to this one, too, because we're seeing lots of animals that have modern relations. Glyptodonts, car-sized armadillo relations, are a kick to see bumbling around in company with giant ground sloths and smilodon, the largest saber tooth.
The shortcomings of Beasts are pretty similar to those of Dinosaurs. A couple of more typical documentaries on the second disk make up for the lack of hard core paleontology. The payoff of the documentary approach is worth underplaying the material you can find in more traditional programs and books. There might be a little less money behind this than the earlier show; the worlds we see are a little less lushly populated, with a handful of highlighted species the only ones we see. My only real reservation, though, would be that the complexity of human origins suffers. That's one story I don't think you can gloss over the scientific debate for... maybe another entire series would really be better.
So, what I'm asking for is more. Another series, please. And I trust you to stretch yourselves, out of curiosity, to give us something even better.",1023926400,30,3443,4.927710843373494

First of all, the animation is superior, and the beasts and their stories are even more interesting than Walking with Dinosaurs. Maybe it's because they were more closely related to us, but I found the stories generally more compelling. However, my only complaint is that the scientific context could have been so much better. For example, creatures that have no living relatives are described on the show, but there is no mention of when we believe they perished and why they might have been an evolutionary dead end. I would have found it interesting to show where the various animals fit in a graphic timeline, and in a ""family tree"" showing what they are believed to have become and when. In other words, these wonderful stories and animation could have done a better job of showing us what scientific evidence they are based on. They are entertaining, and wonderful to watch for children or adults. On the second DVD, there is general talk about methodology of paleontologists, BUT it is not tied very well to the creatures we saw in the series. Also, for example, there is talk about South America breaking off of Antarctica and evenually bumping into North America, but this process could have been showed so much more effectively with a simple animation tied to a timeline.",1019520000,2,1402,4.773662551440329

1664131,5,B00005U2KN,"The team that brought you Walking With Dinosaurs brings you look at the world from time not long after the dinosaurs were extinct until just a few thousand years ago.  Since I was reasonably familiar with dinosaurs already, this new series was a lot more informative for me.
We see a world where giant birds hunt cat-sized horses, where a pig is the meanest thing on the block, where the ancestor of sheep was a carnivore, where whales had teeth and attitude.  We learn that there was really no such animal as a sabre-tooth ""tiger,"" but there a large variety of sabre-tooth cats.
Technically, the team has progressed significantly, as the effects are, on the whole, much more realistic.  Given that most of animals have hair now, this is a real accomplishment.  There were a few moments when things didn't look real, and they had to do mostly with the early humans (austrailopithicus).  These looked a little phony compared to the others, although they looked better on DVD than they did when I first watched this show on the Discovery channel.
Just an aside, was I the only one, when the tribe of pre-humans was driven away from their watering hole, who expected to see a 2001 monolith teaching them how to kill things with bones?
The only downside I found was the fact that there really wasn't enough room to adequately tell the human story, and many stages of human evolution where left out.  I kind of wish they had left the humans out altogether and done a third special, ""Walking with Early Humans,"" or something like that.
The narration by Kenneth Branaugh is, as before, superior to the American actor they hired to redub the show for the Discovery Channel, although Stockard Channing was a lot better than Avery Brooks.  Why do they feel the need to redo the narration for American television?  It's not like Branaugh isn't famous over here.  He's sure a lot better known than Avery Brooks.

The first is that the animation and animatronics looks much more fake than they ever did previously. Even some of the CGI is very jerky, whales shifting unrealistically mid-jump, other creatures doing the same. Then when we get to certain 'rubber' puppets, they shake and vibrate in a way that just screams PUPPET!
If this were the UK region 2 version, there my criticism would end and the show would get a solid 4 stars.
However this is the US version and the shameful editing is to be deplored. A couple of austrolipithicus (gasp) have sex. Like creatures have been doing for hundreds of millions of years. But in the US edition this scene is blurred out.
Are Americans so pitifully prudish that they can stomach to see thousands of unnnatural acts of people shooting and killing each other in myriads of ways, but can't stomach 2 seconds of the most natural act in the world, sex, which if it wasn't blurred out, people would see was masked my grass anyway?

This one definitely lives up to its predecessor- Walking with Dinosaurs, which was the first series to combine breathtaking digital effects with great scientific research and analysis, to create a lost world of creatures and times long gone. Walking with Prehistoric Beasts is actually just a continuation of where Walking with Dinosaurs left off, it begins right after the massive dinosaur extinction and ends during the ice age and the dawn of man. It looks mainly at the rise of mammals and the changing environment and earth. Some of the highlights of the series include: the first whales that actually walked on land, flightless carnivorous birds which were descendants of the dinosaurs, packs of saber-tooth cats killing and mating, huge pig like creatures that bully other carnivores, the first apes to walk on two legs, elephant ancestors that are four times bigger and really angry, herds of wooly mammoths, and much much more. And the computer graphics in this series may even rival that of Walking with Dinosaurs. The scenes and animals almost always look breathtaking and incredibly natural. Sometimes it was seriously hard to believe that these weren't real living animals. And all the sound effects matched everything perfectly, bringing it all to life. Also the music score is terrific, it really takes you on a great auditory journey along with the superb visuals. This series has brought to life a world that you could only imagine before and it does it with serious style, just like its predecessor.
The 6 episode series alone packs a serious punch, but the DVD includes two 50-minute behind-the-scenes featurettes, along with some other goodies. The first featurette discusses how we know what we do about the ancient mammals, the second focuses on the evolution of man from ape and also looks at the Neanderthal briefly. Both featurettes contain informative interviews with scientists as well as behind-the scenes footage of the making of Walking with Prehistoric Beasts, and are very nice additions to an already excellent and worthwhile purchase. There are also interviews with the creators of the series, as well as fact files about the different ancient beasts (really cool), and the usual photo gallery and storyboards. You know it's exceptionally good, when you've watched all 300 minutes on the DVD in one sitting and still want more. I just hope this isn't the last we see of the ""Walking With"" series...",1013558400,9,2488,5.1004901960784315
1664159,5,B00005U2KN,"I love watching nature programs and have been fascinated with dinosaurs and prehistoric animals since I was a child.  When  this program aired on television, I was blown away with the quality and the education that this documentary provide.  This is worth having on dvd because of the great special effects and the education value it can have for people of all ages.  It teaches us about prehistoric man and the animals around him by entertaining us with eye popping visuals.  I highly recommend this to anyone!",1013558400,,511,4.827586206896552

7954230,1,B00005U2KN,"We loved The American version of Walking with the Dinosaurs and expected the same excellent stories, humor, and careful attention to detail in this sequel.  Not only does it lack all the flair and good story telling of its predecessor, the graphics are terrible and cut-budget.  In ""Dinosaurs"" you are easily swept into watching the events unfold just like a educational nature video.  You really can see the dinos and believe in them.  This video looks like a bad college film making project with no budget.  And expect every episode to spend some time on peeing, pooping, and animal sex.  Not worth he money and not suitable for younger kids.  Shame on BBC for this one.  To top it all off, the copy I purchased won't even play all the episodes.  Part way through it locks up and will not show that full disk.  So either the BBC just up on doing the job, or I got robbed a second time with a cheap knock off. Disgusted on both counts!",1515628800,,936,4.452941176470588
