8080565,5,B000AYELRO,"The concert was a bit short at 60 minutes.  However the video quality was amazing -- the colors were deeply saturated and the images were very sharp.  The sound quality on DTS was excellent.  There were many shots of Venice and some nice dance scenes.  The program included Rossini, Verdi, Puccini, Respighi, and Mascagni.  The Teatro la Fenice is beautiful.  All in all this was a lovely DVD of an very nice performance.",1381622400,,421,4.698630136986301
8080566,5,B000AYELRO,"Splendid concert! The video is a little odd, but what a performance! I haven't heard the Intermezzi from Cavalleria Rusticana and Manon lescaut performed so beautifully! Pretre is simply terrific. Singers are OK, but if you buy this video, buy it because of the conductor. What a musician!",1203033600,2,289,5.041666666666667
