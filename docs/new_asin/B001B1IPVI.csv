It will not have to be the lava which kills people; it will be the eruptive force of deadly volcanic ash (rock particles turned to dust through unimaginable pressure) which fill the lungs of anything alive, kill vegetation by burying it and blocking out the sun. Winds will carry the ash through state after state. The energy force of the volcanic explosions will make those World War 11 H-bombs dropped on Hiroshoma and Nagasaki look like two baby's exhalation breaths.

A must have movie for all those serious about the subject of volcanos and how volcanologists and geologists risk their lives to protect us from them.

As the same time we are yelling at the scentists to ""get out of there, it's too dangerous""; we are cheering them on, as the knowledge of this breathtaking crisis must be understood and protected against.

The movie shows eruption after eruption in all their variants (there are many variations).

Like any other natural creative destructive force, if you are in the path of its supra-heated liquid rock, you will die. You will turn to dust and vapor before others' eyes, as do the trees and houses in this video.

Beautiful eruptions in its deadly force. Close-up photography shows the courage our scientists have.

Great length to movie as the subject is covered thoroughly. Humor too!",1222128000,,1442,4.865306122448979
