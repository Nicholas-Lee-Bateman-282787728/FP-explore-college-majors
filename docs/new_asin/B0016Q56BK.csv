People saw past her quirkiness and valued her insights.  Her main message is to find the gold/lessons from what you've been through and feel them as inherent strengths.  While helping others we also see her working on herself as she explores different aspects of herself.  She was bullied when she was in high school which led to her spending a lot of time alone but from this experience she discovered not only who she was but also that she liked who she found.

8264051,5,B0016Q56BK,I really loved this show when it was on and then all of a sudden it just vanished! It is too bad because this was a really funny show. I like Judy Greer. It was nice to see her as the star and not just as a supporting actress like she usually is. Hopefully this show will be available on DVD sometime.,1308614400,4,301,3.870967741935484
8264052,5,B0016Q56BK,ABC guaranteed this would not make it the way they scheduled and promoted it but it is one of the more entertaining comedies of the past few years. Hopefully it will come out on dvd sometime soon.,1247011200,4,196,4.324324324324325

Miss Guided was a hilarious show and recieved cancelation too early.  The DVD's will make you laugh til you cry.  Such a hilarious show!",1217376000,7,258,4.425531914893617
