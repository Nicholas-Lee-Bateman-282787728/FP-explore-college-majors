Good value",1457827200,,30,4.0
8142665,3,B000I0OQIO,Interesting video showing Cindy teaching her students in one-on-one settings covering a variety of topics. The problem is that the video covers too wide of a variety of subjects and doesn't spend enough time teaching any of them in detail. It wasn't very expensive so I figure if I learned even one little tip it was worth the price.,1438473600,,333,4.661016949152542
8142666,5,B000I0OQIO,"Review on this DVD says it's not comprehensive due to its shortness, but Cindy covered all the salient points. Students executed, Cindy explained the students' tendencies and recapped well how they did, succinctly pointing out the highlights. True, it doesn't cover every aspect of the swing, but she covers the main ones. Informative lessons.",1324080000,3,343,5.37037037037037
