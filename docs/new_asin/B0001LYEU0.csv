8014212,5,B0001LYEU0,"A really good anime. It has a sad ending, but a hopeful sad ending with the promise of bringing bigger and better things.",1420070400,,121,4.304347826086956
8014213,4,B0001LYEU0,"As Volume 5 of Figure 17 opens, Tsubasa is dealing with the news that Sho, her classmate that she had a crush on, has passed away. There's really not a lot of explanation of what the problem was and it never really comes up again. It seemed a little too convenient, and almost seemed to be exploitive of the characters. A little friction begins to pop up between Tsubasa and Hikaru over the matter of who has the most right to deal with the loss. As the two girls come to grips with Sho's death, the Maguar are on the move, as The Maguar Mother, a la Aliens, is producing more and more babies, and within three months, Earth could be overrun, that is unless Tsubasa and Hikaru can overcome their depression and help DD and Oldeena fight against an increasingly powerful population of deadly monsters.  And then there's the obligatory news reporter snooping around town...

As mentioned in the paragraph above, I thought the death of Sho was a little overdone in terms of killing of a character. Just when Tsubasa was coming out of her shell a bit, he falls dead! She had already lost her mother, and time after time it is brought up that Hikaru is only going to be around for a limited time too. It's a little much even for an animated character to go through. The Maguar battle sequences are kept pretty much to a limited role in these two episodes, and that's a good thing. The unimaginative designs and seen-it-all-before syndrome really creeps in during these moments. The two main characters are Figure 17's main draw and to see these two girls interact is really a treat and a joy.  Maybe it would have been better if they had cut out all the battle?

DVD features super-short interviews with the music director and a promotion appearance by the anime's makers.",1128038400,,1767,4.547169811320755
