8344070,4,B001UJUH26,"Holy Flame is a pretty nutty movie. It was made to cash in on the Zu Warriors fantasy craze and has one of the cooler actors from the 5 Venoms crew. I wouldn't consider that a bad thing since many of the great Hong Kong films were made to cash in on whatever wave had just hit like Hard Boiled where John Woo decided to cash in on the genre he created with A Better Tomorrow and The Killer. Hard Boiled had the same 5 Venoms actor too.

The movie is pretty convoluted. Separated siblings, evil masters, an Indian Jones style treasure hunt, warring clans, and a billion other subplots all combine here into something that is crazy but just comprehensible enough not to make you want to quit. The wildest part is the fantasy bits. People get some crazy powers here. A good example is the snake bitten fingers that turn red and shoot lasers. My favorite part is when one character literally has to fight off words flying at him. It's not supposed to be signs but some form of tangible magic language flying at him. He's literally fighting writing or maybe literacy. There's some gloriously wild images in the movie.

It's not perfect. It's cheesy in some areas. The cool thing is they have the original language audio with subtitles. It helps a little. I don't think anyone wanted to make great art here. They just wanted the audience to have fun. They accomplished their goal in my case.",1475625600,3,1385,4.492063492063492
8344071,5,B001UJUH26,"This is not the standard Gung Fu movie it is a ""Aladdin and his lamp"" Gung Fu Movie. It is fun and a great fantasy movie from the Shaw Brothers...",1464566400,,146,3.9
8344072,5,B001UJUH26,"this is one of my favorite go to 80's kung fu flicks.  lots of fun special effects, a completely nonsensical story, everything i'd expect from this genre.",1403481600,2,154,4.703703703703703
8344073,5,B001UJUH26,"This is a FANTASTIC DVD. The subtitles are easily read throughout (& even on-screen text gets translated) & the picture quality is great!

I was terrified when making this purchase because foreign DVDs (especially Martial Arts films) often are horribly mutilated when sold in the states. Dub only, wrong aspect ratio, horrible transfers, etc.

I wanted to write this a review of the DVD and not of the movie itself because I almost didn't buy it because of my fears. (I've been hurt before)

I had seen this film prior to my purchase and I am a huge fan.",1386633600,8,554,4.575757575757576
8344074,2,B001UJUH26,"Are you serious? While this may be somewhat fun, It's hardly a quality Kung Fu Flick. Sure they're all a bit fantastical and unrealistic but this is over (or should I say under) the top. The special effects are worse than usual, the fight scenes horrible and the cinematography was bad even for a Shaw Bros. movie. Closer to a Tom Baker Dr. Who ( which I actually like) than a Kung Fu movie. Not a movie for a true Kung Fu fan!.......will I watch it again?......you bet'cha!",1291248000,3,474,4.3977272727272725
8344075,4,B001UJUH26,"This is a fantastical, cheezy martial arts adventure featuring sped up action, lots of wire work and second rate animation.  In a word:  ""nutty.""  Made the same year as Zu Warrior's, this looks like a fast knock-off.  It's wonderful if you don't care about tracking the plot and can embrace the style.  There are lots of guilty pleasures imbeded in Asian film fare, particularly around the early 80's.  This film, Holy Flame of the Martial World, ranks up there with the best (whatever happened this stuff?  More fun than CGI, to be sure.)",1256428800,14,539,4.731182795698925
