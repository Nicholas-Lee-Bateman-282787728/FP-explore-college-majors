8493539,1,B0065QDWZS,"Pure junk...weak audio............computerized visuals. Buy the Bosch book and get an in depth look.
 Do Not Buy this DVD. Mine went into the round file.",1370131200,,153,5.12
8493540,3,B0065QDWZS,"For a layman or a novice, this DVD contains difficult concept of how the injection system works but you may grasp
how the common-rail injection system works. One thing that surprised me by watching this DVD is the fact that any brand new common-rail system uses extremely high pressure which gives diesel fuel high energy",1358812800,,321,4.8545454545454545
8493541,3,B0065QDWZS,"The narrator is a computer generated voice, which makes the video a little hard to understand.  The animation is archaic, but for the price it is well worth the money for an introductory to common rail injection.",1347494400,,212,4.72972972972973
