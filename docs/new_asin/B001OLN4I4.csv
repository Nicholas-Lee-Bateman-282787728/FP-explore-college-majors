in self defence.

There are also some very effective drills on using equipment to train your
kicks and develop your fitness and endurance

8330769,5,B001OLN4I4,"A fighting style that is simple direct and to the point much like the instruction contained within this DVD.
Enough said, buy it and learn it!",1357516800,,142,4.5
8330770,5,B001OLN4I4,"this video starts with a little history then some of the street kicks of the style followed by combinations and drills. i would've given it 4 stars and noted that it would be even better if it talked about the hand strikes and grappling methods of defense dans la rue but the title of the video clearly says ""street kicking"" and thats exactly what it covers. i've always been a fan of savate and western martial arts in general but never liked the extreme chambering motions before kicking. this does away with extreme chambering. it does use arm extensions (reaching out for balance which many modern martial artists dislike) but it even manages to do that in a realistic way. if you are looking for mixed martial arts or hundreds of kicks you may be disappointed, but if you are a savate or even a self defense fan looking to increase your effectiveness, you should be pleased with this video",1325289600,7,894,4.59375
