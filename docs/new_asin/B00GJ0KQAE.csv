6078336,5,B00GJ0KQAE,"This is an excellent film, except for one glaring mistake.  Near the beginning of the film, Lee Oswald is referred to as President Kennedy's ""convicted killer.""  I would remind the film-maker that Oswald never had a trial, and in fact, repeatedly requested legal assistance and never got any.  I will quote one witty journalist:  ""Lee Oswald miraculously managed to survive nearly 48 hours in the custody of the Dallas Police Department.""

I would recommend this for people who are at least moderately interested in the Kennedy assassination.  I do think the casual observer might not find it all that compelling.  There is wonderful archival footage, some of which I have never seen before.",1385769600,70,691,5.061946902654867

6078345,3,B00GJ0KQAE,"This is a biased review because I am what might be called the quintessential conspiracy kook.  I have studied the JFK assassination for years and I am convinced beyond any doubt, and believe that all the evidence accumulated over the past 50 years clearly proves a far reaching conspiracy to commit the crime and an even more sinister conspiracy to cover it up.  It's not a question of whether or not Oswald acted alone, he didn't ""act"" at all.  He had nothing whatsoever to do with the assassination of JFK, the attempted murder of General Walker, or the murder of officer Tippit.  It is with this attitude that I begin reading new books or watching new videos on the subject.

Right out of the gate I knew where this documentary was headed when the chief narrator, David Kaiser, revealed that he was aligned with Robert Blakey of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, AKA the mafia did it committee.

When I ordered the video I was mistakenly under the impression that it would focus on the conspirators critical need to see to it that Oswald was killed ASAP after JFK was killed, preferably that same Friday afternoon.  John Armstrong does a good job investigating this aspect of the case in his book ""Harvey and Lee.""  They weren't worried about Oswald naming names, because he didn't know who was behind the conspiracy.  What they were worried about was that with Oswald alive the avalanche of incriminating evidence that they manufactured ahead of time to dump on him post-assassination would not have worked with him still alive to refute it, especially when information about an Oswald imposter began to surface.  Actually he did get the chance to refute one piece of it before he was killed.  He stated that the infamous backyard photos were forged, or in today's lingo, phtoshopped.  He said that he understood photography real well and in due course he would be able to prove they were forged. By the way, the Warren Commission was fully aware of these imposter episodes, but they had to ignore and downplay each and every one of them, otherwise they would have been faced with the dreaded ""C"" word - conspiracy!

I will say there was some good commentary from knowledgeable researchers like John Newman, Dick Russell and Joan Mellon.

One part of the video that annoyed me so much that I was tempted to fast forward it was the stand-in Oswald reciting a letter written to his brother.  It was like watching some bizarre propaganda film accented with a bleak and depressing background.

Overall I don't think this video is much help to anyone new to the subject.  I believe that if you want to produce a documentary like this, choose one side or the other and then make your case.  The trouble with this production and so many others on the JFK assassination is that they batter the viewer back and forth with conflicting information from both sides making it nearly impossible for anyone being exposed to it for the first time to make any sense of it all.",1399248000,19,2975,4.710424710424711

6078350,5,B00GJ0KQAE,"This is a very interesting film.  There is a short bit of film of the FBI's recreation of the hiding of the rifle and running down the stairs.  My question is,  why is that short piece of film sped up?  I have to assume the makers of Killing Oswald used the film as is; from the archives I suppose.  So did the FBI speed the film up to cut the time it would have taken to hide the rifle and get downstairs because Oswald was stopped in the 2nd floor lunch room about 90 secs after the shooting.  Did the FBI speed up that bit of ""recreation"" to ""make sure"" Oswald would have time to get downstairs.
  It's only that short bit of black & white footage that is sped up, the rest of the film is very well done & if that film was acquired in it's fast speed,  I certainly appreciate Shane O'Sullivan keeping the footage at the speed they received it in.  It sticks out like a sore thumb to me, but if you didn't notice it (I didn't the first time I watched this documentry),  it's worth re-watching",1393286400,3,994,4.125
6078351,5,B00GJ0KQAE,"Watching Killing Oswald, is like watching a batter hit one over the centerfielders head, race to third for a triple and then get thrown out at the plate by 20 feet trying to extend it into an inside the park homer. I am going to give this a 5 but part of the reason I score it so high is because of the paucity of quality documentaries about the JFK assassination.  This film is of quality production and looks very professional. This sets it apart from some of the other documentaries I have seen. And the film includes a lot of great film clips of Oswald and various characters in the assassination over the years. The talking heads, for the most part, do an effective job filling in the background information. For this reason, this is a very valuable film.

However, I have to say I was disappointed in several areas of the film. The film uses David Kaiser as the main talking head. In several snippets, Kaiser does an effective job filling in some key narrative facts. On the other hand, the views that he presents are not supported by many serious JFK assassination researchers. This film would have been so much better had they replaced him with someone like a Jim Dieugenio, Joseph McBride, Jim Douglas, or John Armstrong, to name a few. By including Kaisers theories, the film does not present a coherent story when mixed with the rest of the film. Given the amount of information that is presently known about the assassination and Oswalds role in it, this is a monumental mistake in my opinion. And that is why this film fails to hit a homer.

Here are my main points of contention:

The film plays an audio clip of Marguerite Oswald stating that history will prove that her son was not involved in the assassination. Moments later, Kaiser states that Oswalds mom was a nut and that she had Mob ties.
The film essentially presents Kaiser as the reasonable voice in the JFK assassination research community. He states that lone nut theorists as well as conspiracy theorists both tend to take extreme positions and that his position (as well as Robert Blakeys) is the more reasonable position. His stated position appears to be that Oswald killed Kennedy but that he was directed by the Mob. If anything, his position is one of the least respected theories in the research community.
Ruth Paine is shown several times circa 1964 on film making statements about Oswald. Although the film explores Oswalds CIA connections, it does not make any attempt to expose what some researchers believe is Paines connection to the CIA and her role as Oswalds handler after the handoff by Mohrenschildt. There is nothing about her role in his life before the assassination or her role in finding incriminating evidence against Oswald in the months after the assassination.
The film shows re-enactments with an actor reading the letters of Oswald, or in scenes at the embassies. Given the strong possibility that it was actually an impostor in Mexico City, they nonetheless show Oswald as having gone there.
They show the Silvia Odio incident but Kaiser dilutes the strength of this scene by having Kaiser state that Loren Hall was involved.
The film shows a David Atlee Philips re-enactment with Philips stating that the Hosty note indicated that Oswald was going to blow up the FBI office. They did not present the evidence that Philips statement was intentionally false.  Without showing this, it makes Oswald appear to be a lunatic.
Finally, the film allows Kaiser to state his theory that the Mob was really behind it and that Oswald actually killed JFK.

Insomuch as Kaiser presents background information to fill in parts of the narrative, he did a decent job. On the other hand, this film appears to be a vehicle to allow him to espouse his views without balancing it out with the facts. With the progress that has been made in the research community over the years, it is disappointing that this film fails to use the best research available. I will have to say that I thought that Newman, Russell and Mellen did a nice job. I would have liked to have seen more of them and less of Kaiser.",1392422400,27,4092,4.700139470013947

6078353,5,B00GJ0KQAE,"This movie has great footage and shows how Oswald did not act alone but was as he said a ""patsy.""  He also said truthfully, ""I shot nobody.""",1389225600,4,140,4.185185185185185
6078354,5,B00GJ0KQAE,"Excellent account of Oswald's background

worth the actual purchase price",1389052800,2,113,4.7
6078355,5,B00GJ0KQAE,"This is a very strong, though not perfect, two-hour collection. It collects just about every bit of film footage we have of Oswald (except for some color film of him on a New Orleans street which surfaced in the last few years), and excerpts from the New Orleans radio interview. It demonstrates what an intelligent and articulate young man Oswald was, going against the official stereotype of him as an uneducated nobody.

There is a bit too much reliance on David Kaiser, who believes that Oswald killed JFK and that the ""backyard photos"" are genuine. Russell discusses the Richard Case Nagell story and Newman talks about Mexico City. Veciana tells about seeing Oswald meeting with an agent he knew as Maurice Bishop in Dallas. A caption reveals that Veciana recently disclosed that ""Bishop"" was CIA officer David Atlee Phillips. Also included is a brief color clip of Phillips at Win Scott's wedding in December 1962.

The Sylvia Odio and Mexico City incidents are examined from different angles.

There is an old interview (looks like late 1960s) with Loran Hall that I'd never seen before where he talks about being briefly jailed in Dallas before the assassination. I was amazed that he doesn't have the slightest trace of a Cuban accent. He sounds like he's from California. An excerpt from a phone interview from the late 70s is misused by Kaiser to link Hall and Santo Trafficante to the assassination. However, during his testimony to the HSCA in 1977, Hall makes it clear that he is referring to the Bayo-Pawley raid rather than the killing of Kennedy.

There is vintage footage of an Allen Dulles interview in 1965, and a 1968 George de Mohrenschildt interview. He is asked whether Oswald was a friend or an enemy of President Kennedy. De Mohrenschildt replies, ""He definitely was not an enemy. He was an admirer of President Kennedy. From his point of view, he was an excellent President and his ideas corresponded very well with President Kennedy's ideas and vice versa."" At one point he refers to him as ""Harvey Lee Oswald,"" as so many people did (government documents before the assassination, Clay Shaw, even Robert Kennedy). De Mohrenschildt laughs at the government's idea that a lunatic killed a lunatic who killed the President, and now another lunatic (Jim Garrison) is reopening the investigation - are there really so many lunatics in America?

There is also 1964 film footage of a Ruth Paine interview. As with all her interviews, they reveal (like Oswald) a serious, disciplined, intelligent person who stays on message. I'd never seen the film of Gen. Walker being interviewed right after the ""assassination attempt,"" and he appears to be almost smirking as he describes it.

There are many samples of Oswald's writings, his evolving political views, his rejection of capitalism, communism and socialism, and his attempts to find another social-democratic alternative. He talks about the possibility of a military coup overthrowing the US government, possibly being organized by the Marines. Oswald also talked about how much Russia and the US needed to work out their differences ""because our two countries have too much to offer each other than to be tearing at each other's throats in an endless Cold War.""

Since this is a documentary about Oswald, there is a bit too much footage of Jack (and Jackie in Spanish) talking hawkishly about Cuba from the 1960 campaign, without any discussion of the back-channel talks JFK was having with Castro in late 1963 about normalizing relations with Cuba. There is only a brief mention of JFK's tensions with the military leadership (some clips from the film Seven Days in May and discussion of Gen. Edwin Walker are included - no mention of Generals Lemnitzer and LeMay, Admiral Anderson and SAC Commander Thomas Power).",1387929600,38,3791,4.988924050632911
6078356,4,B00GJ0KQAE,"A very good dvd which gathers evidence about LHO and whatever part he played in the assassination of JFK.As a collector of dvds
about JFK I have 30+ and this has film clips I've never seen before. Very good picture quality makes for a film which keeps you focussed on this man/patsy and his place in history. Several issues are not fully challenged such as the backyard photos and the so
called attempt to kill Gen. Walker. Also LHO worked on the Japanese airbase where the U2 spy plane was kept. This plane was the most top secret project ever by the CIA and to think that LHO could announce his ""defection"" to the USSR and not have the CIA
kill him on the spot is a huge clue as to why he was allowed to go.
The extras on this dvd mention the possibility that the Zapruder film has been altered. Perhaps the makers of this film could have a
follow up dvd on that subject. Well worth viewing.",1387411200,25,893,4.258823529411765

8623685,5,B00GJ0KQAE,"The main feature, Killing Oswald, is an excellent documentary.  It doesn't come to any definitive conclusion, but raises many more probing questions regarding the most enigmatic figure of the 20th century.  The two Special Features are nothing short of superb and I'm surprised that none of the other reviews made mention of them.  These two features are two 84+ minute interviews with Doug Horne who was a central figure in the Assassinations Records Review Board which was created shortly after the Oliver Stone film, JFK, which pressured the government to release thousands of classified documents.  Horne starting in 1995, and through 1998 reviewed many documents and records that had been sealed since the assassination of JFK.  These documentaries present two startling findings: clear evidence that the Zapruder film of JFK's assassination had been tampered and manipulated by the government to obscure a rear exit wound along with some other possible editing.  In addition, the second documentary exposes issues with the JFK autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital, which turned out to be another sham to cover up a rear-exit wound.  The fact that people in the U.S. government were the participants in these cover-ups is actually very shocking.  The obvious reason was to suppress evidence that there was a second gunman that shot JFK from the front.  Doug Horne has very impressive credentials and has collected persuasive evidence by deposing key witnesses involved in the chain of custody of the film and the autopsy.  His frustration that the mainstream media refuses to cover these problems is very revealing about the abuses of the press the last 54 years.  A must see for anyone who cares about the history of America.",1510012800,,1729,5.161290322580645

This is a docudrama and sets off with lots of film and audio recordings of Oswald. From his unstable mother and career as a Marine. He quickly absorbs his Marxist view and shares them. He moves to the Soviet Union where he offers the KGB secrets about the U2 spy plane program he was a part of in his Marine career. The KGB decided he is an unstable man but he is soon bored with the minion radio factory job he is assigned in Minsk. He meets and marries a pharmacist named Marina and then wants to move back to the US.  This goes into great detail about his back and forth travels and ideas of how and why he made all his moves and actually follows the trail of most of his movements prior to the assignation of President Kennedy. Included are many interviews and opinions of who what and when and why Oswald made his bizarre actions prior to the killing. If you like Conspiracy Theory you will love this one.
