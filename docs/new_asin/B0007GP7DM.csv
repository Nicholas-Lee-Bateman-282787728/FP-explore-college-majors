8047323,4,B0007GP7DM,"This Malian film is truly unique. A kind of fairy tale, it's a period piece that has as its setting a village in something like the 18th century (perhaps), or maybe the 19th. We know it's one of those two (it could even be the early 20th century) because there are quite a few rifles on display (which are fired also). But exactly when this all happens we just don't know.

But this uncertain time setting adds to the mystique of the film. The title refers to a despot with powers of black magic who has taken over the village of Sitakali, murdered his wife and raised his dwarf son. Now the fairest girl in the village, Kani, is betrothed to the dwarf, Janguine, but instead of the girl he wants the girl's mother Meya because she has a bigger rump.

The characters also include Mambi, Meya's husband; Siriman, a hunter with magical powers; and the local griot. The tale is introduced and concluded by another griot, presumably in today's Mali, the storyteller (but there's no voiceover; the tale unfolds after the introduction).

The costumes are terrific, as is the horseplay, and various scenes of the power of black and white magic. There are wrestlers, musicians who play traditional music and dance as they play, girls looking for husbands, village elders, the town drunk, and ""knights""--suitors for Kani's hand, knowing she has no interest in either Guimba or his son.

The director has done a great job of capturing not only the essence of the native culture but also creating a resonant piece of cinema with mythic overtones.  This is a great addition to your world cinema DVD collection and highly recommended.",1121472000,16,1621,4.73404255319149
8047324,5,B0007GP7DM,"First I should say that this story may be a little difficult to follow if you are not familiar with African storytelling. That said, it is bound to please anybody who is interested in West African culture.
It's about a tyrant who rules with cruelty and magic. His greed and his son's lust for women with large buttocks eventually upset the people who rally against him with magic more powerful than his own.
The scenery is spectacular. The mud architecture is impressive. And the costumes, especially the women's colorful dresses, are a delight. It is also fun to watch the women fight among themselves.",1027814400,6,603,4.8076923076923075
