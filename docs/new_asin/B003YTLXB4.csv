up in rural Pleasants County in the years after WW II, and identify in many ways with the hardships...(no that's
not the word to use) with the joy of having a wonderful, Christian centered, upbringing on a small farm. There
are many benefits to such a childhood that cannot be described to my children, or my grandchildren,or to most any
of todays children. Especially to those of the East or West coasts. I don't mean to take anything away from any
childhood experiences of others, but I must expound the virtues of such a childhood.

Being a history buff, especially of rural West Virginia, I believe this series is the most complete of any I have
been privilaged to view. The ethos of my parents, grandparents, and aunts & uncles is evident in the scenes shown
in this series from around the state. It is my fervent prayer that this series be shown to all West Virginia
school students for many years to come. I wish it was available on DVD again so I could have a copy in my personal
library. It is currently viewable on West Virginia Public Broadcasting stations.

PLEASE MAKE THIS TITAL AVAILABLE AGAIN!",1298505600,17,1221,4.545454545454546
