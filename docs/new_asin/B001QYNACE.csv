This DVD 'Floyd on Spain' is a wonderful introduction to Floyd if you don't know much about him, but will also delight long-standing fans as well. He visits many different regions of Spain like Andalusia and Catalonia and Galicia, which are all often very different linguistically and culturally and cuisine-wise and so on. As well as Floyd visiting all these wonderful regions of Spain and cooking all sorts of fantastic and delicious food, he meets all sorts of interesting and colourful people, who half the time don't understand him because they don't speak English (and he can hardly speak Spanish!) but who make the shows just brilliant. He tries very hard, in his own eccentrically English way, to capture the atmosphere of each place he visits. And, of course, he has a 'slurp' or two of the local wine and sometimes beer of the places he visits! Wouldn't be old Floydy if he didn't have a slurp or two would it?!

This DVD has given me a taste, if you pardon the pun, for Keith Floyd's other DVD's and I have bought some more as Christmas pressies which I expect will also be enjoyed immensely as 'Floyd on Spain' has been. I can't recommend this DVD highly enough, even if you haven't experienced Floyd before, because it's a nice introduction to this sadly missed cooking superstar. And if you have other Keith Floyd DVDs or books, it is another DVD you can add to your collection.

p.s. I noticed that most Floyd stuff is available on Amazon (UK), but have been surprised that the series of 'Floyd's India' isn't available. I'm surprised as it is a very good series. Oh well...

Also, the UK Amazon version of this is 210 minutes and this one says 89 minutes, best then to try and get the UK version!",1370563200,,1890,4.52046783625731
