8080289,4,B000AXWGVS,"Ippo has been entered into an A-class boxing tournament whose winner would gain credibility to challenge for the Japanese Championship. He begins training, but his mother collapses from all the extra work she has been doing because Ippo has been too busy boxing. When she is checked into a hospital, Ippo has to hope for some type of miracle as he has to ponder quitting boxing for good. He might just get a godsend in the form of an old friend offering to help out with the workload. Ippo won't be able to train AND work because his first opponent in the tournament is no joke. Saeki, or he's more commonly known, ""The Speed Star"", is known for his deadly quickness. Ippo also has to set an example for Yamada, his doofus apprentice, who is preparing to get his certification.

This volume was great because it brought Ippo back to Earth. For 8 volumes, he hasn't really given a lot of thought to what his mom was sacrificing for his dream. There have been hints before of the stress and overwork she's been enduring but she finally reaches the breaking point here. It makes him appreciate her more and also makes him think about what is really important. It was cool when Umezawa, the gangster bully that used to pick on him all the time, came back into the picture, not as an enemy, but as a big fan of his. He's even drawing and writing a manga based on Ippo's feats! I didn't like the fact that Ippo's opponent, Saeki, wasn't fleshed out as much as the other fighters he's gone against. I always found it interesting to know their backstories. This is an inspiring and evolving show, heavy on suspense and passion.

I would also recommend the first Rocky with Sylvester Stallone.",1146873600,,1684,4.536184210526316
