3682863,2,B001LEX5BU,"This movie is a thriller in the same vein as ""I Spit on your Grave"".  A cheaply done flick with atrocious acting and despicable characters throughout.  A shrewish lady is brutally raped by 4 assailants at the beginning of the film.  They are incarcerated but she is having a difficult time recovering, which is understandable.  Its rather slow going and most of the movie is so dark that your eyes have a hard time adjusting.  The protagonist is hard to sympathize with, she has this whiny, high pitched voice that could break glass.  One funny tidbit, the main character is visited by her sister who for some reason has an English accent, why?  I guess it really doesn't make a difference in this movie.",1399766400,3,704,4.629032258064516

8317903,4,B001LEX5BU,"I must say I liked this strange exploitation film. It's kind of like a lifetime original drama with a twisted Horror edge. I enjoyed it despite having a somewhat in satisfying ending. I felt it could have been more, but the film turned out to be an enjoyable little demented treat!",1498953600,,281,4.529411764705882

8317906,3,B001LEX5BU,"Demented involves a woman who is gang raped.  Those involved are arrested and put away.  Our main actress comes back home to a cheating husband.  She has trouble adjusting to her new life.  The neighbor kids pull mean pranks on her (really mean).  Eventually, she snaps and goes DEMENTED.

Very lackluster until the last ten minutes.  Even then, you endure a lot of boring scenes, bad acting, and me just wondering why this movie was made.  Not very gory.  Slasher collectors of that time period will love it.  Not a great movie, though.

It's not like I Spit on you Grave or Thriller where the revenge is well-plotted out and built up.  Demented is a very wimpy version of those other rape revenge flicks.

The blu-ray looks fantastic.  Great picture quality.  No extras.  Boo.",1492992000,5,778,4.6940298507462686
8317907,1,B001LEX5BU,"Great revenge thriller set to be released by Shout Factory and again Shout Factory is too precious to release a DVD/Blu-Ray combo! Oh, No! DVD is too downmarket for them now! I hope somebody else like Vinegar Syndrome brings out a twin format release like they did with Slaughterhouse, previously on Shout Factory Blu-Ray only release!",1471910400,2,335,5.0
8317908,3,B001LEX5BU,"DEMENTED is a preposterous, rather dull ""thriller"" from 1980. Linda Rodgers (Sallee Young) returns home after years of therapy, trying to recover from a gang-rape by a group of masked men. She's now readjusting to her marriage to Matt (Harry Reems- DEEP THROAT), but is having difficulty due to her flashbacks and damaged emotions. Linda also has an understandable problem w/ intimacy. This is also hard on Matt, who is busy sneaking off to be w/ his mistress. Astoundingly, Linda finds herself plagued by a new group of perverted pinheads! In masks! Linda begins to unravel -we know this because her whining, warbling voice rises to ear-melting levels. It's difficult to feel compassion for a character who is so bloody annoying! Every time Linda gets worked up she sounds like a cross between a bratty 10 yo girl and a whistling teakettle! It goes right through your head like a drill! Meanwhile, Matt and his mistress get better acquainted. Unsurprisingly, the second gaggle of attackers returns to get Linda. These clowns are almost as insufferable as Linda herself. Their deaths, while arriving far too late to save this film, do supply some relief! Linda's final descent into madness is fairly believable, and is the most enjoyable part of the movie. It -almost- makes the rest of it worthwhile. If only she had been this good during the first two thirds! Bryan Charles is stoically hilarious as Linda's gun-toting doctor! He's the only one who really seems to care about her welfare. He's also immune to her incessant shrieking, that would turn other, lesser brains into guacamole! Watch in awed amazement...",1422921600,8,1615,4.985185185185185
8317909,1,B001LEX5BU,"Bootleg from a VHS source.  This is a bootleg taken from a VHS source. The film has no official DVD release. If you buy, the quality will be awful.",1411862400,3,147,4.068965517241379
8317910,4,B001LEX5BU,"I remember this rather fondly from the early days of VHS rental. It has elements of REPULSION, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, and CLASS OF 1984/ A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. It's also one of a handful of films that I disagreed with Michael Weldon on in his original PSYCHOTRONIC. Fans of the rape/revenge genre might want to give it a look.",1407024000,,322,4.383333333333334
8317911,5,B001LEX5BU,"I liked this movie a lot. The acting isn't the best, that's for sure, but a lot of early 80's slashers are that way. That's what makes the movie even all the more fun, in my opinion. I have seen this movie about !0 times, and loved it every time watching it. I hunted this movie down back in 2009 or 2010, and bought a bootleg DVD+R copy, which didn't come out too bad in quality either. I wish Shout Scream Factory, Synapse, Code Red, Anchor Bay, or Blue Underground would pick this one up and put it on Blu-ray. Until then, my faithful copy will do. I recommend buying this movie. When you do, enjoy.",1406851200,,602,4.198275862068965
