362427,5,6301797965,A comic masterpiece that has an air of the original. It mimics the feel of the old classics while parodying it just so. A great watch for any age and great for those that have never seen it before to get acquainted with Mel's  older films.

362430,5,6301797965,"Young Frankenstein is a classic. A must-see for comedy fans. The DVD format yeilds two distinct advantages: awesome video quality, and extra content. The georgeous black and white feel of the movie really comes  through on DVD. Crisp, clear, with excellent contrast. The extra content is  icing on the cake. There are deleted scenes, which clear up many of the  unanswered questions from the movie. There is a wonderful 36 minute  documentary on the making of the movie. There are several trailers and some  interviews with the stars. And there are numerous bloopers.
The only  thing that isn't in it (and I wish it was)is a director's commentary.  Commentary from Mel Brooks would likely be as funny as the movie itself.",918000000,4,721,4.909090909090909

362432,5,6301797965,"Young Frankenstein is with out a doubt the defining Mel Brooks movie.  While not as slapstick funny as Blazing Saddles, and (thankfully) not as silly as History of the World, Mel Brooks takes the essence of the original  Frankenstein movies and turns on the comic genius.  The result of this  gunius is one of the best movies of all times.  The one liners and sight  gags are of textbook quality and not at all predictible, and they continue  all the way through to the end.  There are just too many good ones to try  to list them here.  The use of historic sets, and the black and white  format add significantly to the enjoyment of the story.  Also of note  is the all-star cast: Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, Terri  Garr, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, Gene Hackman and a host of others.  The  combination of the great story, superb cast, and classic Mel Brooks comedy,  make this one of my top five movies of all time.",912816000,6,934,4.497005988023952

362754,5,6301797965,"OK Ted this is one movie you'll never get your color on.
This is proof that some life changing movies need to be in Black and white. Color can some time distract from the message.

This film went out of its way to highlight the important parts of the original message and the acting is impeccable.

Young Frankenstein is a tightly written spoof on the series of Hollywood Frankenstein movie sequels. The son of a famous dabbler in the mysteries of life gets intrigued in the craft himself finding it necessary to exchange attributes with his creation.

One of the people in this film that I am keeping a collection of is Teri Garr, ""Star Trek"" (1966) playing ""Roberta Lincoln""(as Terry Garr) in episode: ""Assignment: Earth"" (episode # 2.26) 3/29/1968. And there is so much of her in this film as Inga. I like the part where the doctor comments on the castle doorknockers and Inga thanks him for the compliment. I was relieved to find the DVD did not say that they were special affects.

And true to the originals, after throwing everything insight into the water, the little girl asks what is left to throw in? The monster (Peter Boyle) just looks out at you knowing the answer.",1501113600,,1178,4.595238095238095

362886,5,6301797965,"Viewers expecting a reprise of the joyful anarchy of BLAZING SADDLES would not be disappointed.  With a script by Gene wilder and Mel Brooks, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a film buff's dream.  With copious allusions to James Whale's classics FRANKENSTEIN (1930) and THE BRIDWE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935), not to mention Hitchcock, the script is an affectionate homage to the classic Universal movies.  There are some good jokes - notably the famous sequence where Dr. Frankenstein (Wilder) exchanges lines with a shoeshine boy, inspired by Glenn Miller (""Pardon me boy, is this the Transylvania Station?""/ ""Yes, sit, Track 29, and can I give you a shine?"")  There's also the famous dance routine inspired by Irving Berlin's ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" where Frankenstein and the Creature (Peter Boyle) , dresed in white tie and tails, perform in front of an astonished audience.

The main actors have a whale of a time in their roles.  Wilder exhibits some of the mania he showed in THE PRODUCERS, especially when willing the Creature to come to life.  Boyle is  strangely affecting, especially when he learns how to speak.  Cloris Leachman has great fun as the evil Frau B&uuml;cher, with a performance strongly recalling that of Elsa Lanchester in THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  Teri Garr has obviously seen too many Universal classics, as she wears her emotions on her sleeve, while Marty Feldman is left to do what he does best as Igor (pronounced Eyegor).

Despite the satiric moments, there is something touching about this film.  We feel for the Creature as he tries and fails to find a friend, while being subject to the opprobrium of others.  We understand Frankenstein's desire to create a new person - not just for reputation's sake, but to prove to himself his proficiency as a scientist.  <The film turns out to have a happy, if somewhat bawdy ending, with both protagonists satisfied with their future prospects.

YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is one of the best of Mel Brooks's movies on account of its restraint, as the director reins in the tendency to provide a gag a minute.",1490572800,,2062,4.936231884057971
362887,4,6301797965,"YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (1974) (SPECIAL EDITION) adds a collection of deleted scenes (abut 15 minutes).
The documentary on my SPECIAL EDITION was 41 minutes not 36 minutes like it reads on insert.  Nice, but then there is no Audio commentary by Director Brooks like it reads on box cover.  Oh well.
You do get to hear Mel narrate variations of Trailers for movies and tv spots:  ""Directed personally by Mel 'Blazing Saddles'  Brooks, in black-and-white ... no offense.""
The best of the Outtake blooper Special Feature has got to be Madeline Kahn keeping a straight face (for the most part) as ""That's I-Gor..."" Marty Feldman readies to attack her fur shoal (Wilder can't keep straight face ... and it shows in actual print as seen in movie.)
The one-liners are wonderful in this silly, well crafted spoof-homage to Frankenstein as well as The Bride of Frankenstein that is fun without being needlessly raunchy.
""Hump?  What Hump?""  says I-Gor, with the hump.  Awwk-ward.
""Nevermind.""
Or
""(It's a) Werewolf""
""Werewolf...?""
Igor pointing into darkness ""There wolf.  There castle.  There wolf...""
""Why you talking that way?""
""I thought you wanted too...""  Nope
okay then

If a fan of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN this should be a no-brainer purchase.
Gloris Leachman chews up the scenery (as well as her cigar - and that freakin mole) as the Grandfather Baron's ex ""girl friend"" and Madeline Kahn is every bit as fun as she was in Blazing Saddles (the movie Brooks Directed right before YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN).
""Good Night, Frau Blucher!""  Cue those suddenly disturbed horses.  ""What's wrong with them?""
Movie looks great too as filmed by Gerald Hirschfeld.
Actual Laboratory equipment from original Frankenstein was used here.
Gene Hackman has the, now, somewhat famous cameo as blind man who can't light a cigar or pour a bowl of soup properly.
Poor Monster.
the humor in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN holds up arguably better than any other Mel Brooks movie.
Not quite a 5 star classic 'cuz some jokes are just sooo obvious it's almost painful because, well, it's Mel Brooks!

if you have any inclination for the deep silliness (and the sometimes subtle and knowing satire) of Mel Brooks.

Five BRILLIANT comedy actors, as featured on the cover, all at the TOP of their game.  Great score & reverential black and white photography.

PLUS, a multiplicity of totally cool character performances, including 1) Gene Hackman as a blind, lonely monk that comforts the monster, 2) Cloris Leachman, at her crustiest, as former lover of this Dr. Frankenstein's father, and now ""house mother"" of the castle, and 3) Kennth Mars as Inspector Kemp, the local highly formal and Germanic sheriff of the village, who leads the mass uprisings of the peasants against Dr. Frankenstein.

363225,5,6301797965,"While not quite as wildly funny and off the wall as Mel Brooks' earlier masterpieces The Producers' and 'Blazing Saddles', this is much better film making, with great black and white photography that really captures the original Frankenstein films.  It reminds me of the step Woody Allen took with Love and Death, when he combined his always wild and brilliant comedy with a new visual flair and sophisticated use of the medium.

And if this is a touch more subdued than its predecessors, its still brimming over with amazing comedy both high and low.  The cast is great.  Gene Wilder, while always being very funny, creates a young Frankenstein who seems almost like a real human being, and who we actually feel for in some scenes.  Peter Boyles monster is a brilliant comic creation, accomplished mostly without words.  Marty Feldman as Igor (pronounced Eye-gore) Frankensteins faithful assistant seems to be channeling the soul of Groucho Marx -- and somehow, even though he seems like hes in another, more aggressively silly movie, he pulls it off and it adds instead of distracting.  But everyone is excellent; Madeline Kahn, Terri Garr, and the always wonderful Kenneth Mars.

The only reason Id put this a touch below The Producers is subjective.  Ive seen each about 5 times.  But on a recent re-viewing, The Producers still made me laugh out loud in places, re-seeing Young Frankenstein made me smile a lot, but not laugh.

BTW - It's worth getting the blu-ray for the wonderful cinematography and production design.",1461283200,3,1525,4.964566929133858

He and Gene Wilder really nailed it with this very charming, very funny, very authentic send-up/homage of the black&white Frankenstein movies. Perhaps Cloris Leachman's best performance, ever, too. The entire cast is wonderful...Wilder, Garr, Boyle, Feldman, Kahn.  But enough of the superlatives; let me digress here...I have a plot-related question that perhaps someone out there can address.  Perhaps someone can straighten me out on this: in the story, it was Wilder's grandfather who was the mad scientist, but it is Wilder's great-grandfather who's will is delivered to him during the middle of his med-school lecture.  And the box the will was in appears to be ripped out of the hands of a body, the great-grandfather, that has clearly been dead for decades. So, the grandfather has been dead awhile, and it is the great-grandfather who has recently died, even though the body looks like it's been dead forever?  It doesn't matter, it's a wonderful film, but I'd like to hear comments on this...

Speaking to the technical merits of the Blu Ray...this is the first HD version of this movie that I have purchased, so I can't speak to any revisions from previous Blu Rays... but they did a fine job on the high-def remaster...delicious audio, crisp video, and a great addition to my collection.",1436227200,2,1339,5.040723981900452

Kahn, Feldman, and Boyle are all missed today.  And of course, those of us who fell in love with Terri Garr from her portrayal of Helga will always be a fan of peasant dresses and push up bras.

364257,5,6301797965,"Mel Brooks has worked on a lot of films. He has many films that are in many people's top comedy list but Young Frankenstein is not only a great comedy film but a great film. You know a film is great when people use it as a standard. This film and maybe one or two more is what I judge most other comedies by. I don't think there is a person that I know in my circle of friends, family and co-workers that don't know at least a few lines of this film by heart.

There is a funny story to how I saw this film for the first time. I was too young to see it in the cinema when it came out so I had to wait until it came on cable back in the early 80's. Now I had no idea that this film even existed before I saw it the first time. I had an uncle in another room who asked me to come in and watch the film. He said, its a really good horror film. So at the age of 12 when I sat down to watch it I was expecting something along the lines of the 40's Universal monster films. When it started, since it was in black and white and seemed serious with the score and overall feel I had no reason to think otherwise.

About ten minutes into the film I was thinking this seems kind of silly for a horror film. But as I asked my uncle who was sitting behind me if this really was a serious film he nodded in the affirmative. So the film goes on.

At this point in the film Frankenstein was using the poor patient as a Guinea pig and when he kicked the guy in his ""twig and berries"" I finally had had enough and turned around to my uncle who was nearly passing out and beet red in his face from from trying to not laugh at loud at both the film and my obvious bewilderment in it.

Needless to say I watched the rest of the film knowing it was a comedy. And good lord what a film! I think if I had to name my favourite comedy of all time this would be on the short list and as I said above, I know many people who have it as not just their number one comedy but favourite film if all time.

Being a farce of the Universal Frankenstein I won't bother putting in a plot summary but if you have never seen this film, you will LOVE it. I don't know if I know of another film that is so universally loved.

One point, even though this film is a farce, I personally think its the best Frankenstein film since The Bride of Frankenstein. I don't know if that is a reflection of how good this film is or how bad the more recent Frankensteins are.

I am writing this review because I recently purchased it on Blu-ray. As on most Blu-rays it has a wonderful picture. I am not sure its that much better than a DVD but as the cost is about the same now, treat yourself to the Blu-ray.

Anyway, enough of my gushing, enjoy!",1357776000,5,2692,3.890710382513661

364313,5,6301797965,"Easily my most watched film (30-40x), though this is not a movie you would want to see with me, since like many who love it, I can, and do, quote nearly every line. It is possibly the greatest film parody ever made and pays beautiful homage to the original Frankenstein movies, filmed in black and white and using the equipment from the original movie. The word 'funny' barely describes how err 'funny?' it is. Each line perfectly placed and timed to a level of perfection rarely seen in a comedies these days. Quotes that just slip off the tongue, screens that have to be watched again, just to marvel at how funny they were then just to see the build up to that particular laugh.

The first time I saw it I was unimpressed, it was part of a film club duo with the original Frankenstein first, followed by this (no Brides). I was tired and drifted off through most of the movie. Then a few years later, after some beers on the town with some friends, I saw it again over a Bank Holiday weekend, in fact we laughed through it 3 times. It became the staple movie for this particular Bank Holiday for many years (before everyone ran off, got married and had kids :0)

But the comic writing and timing are near perfect, if the sets are close to perfect, and the cast generally outstanding, then the casting of Marty Feldman as Igor was truely inspired, (the camoe Gene Hackman is the icing with another cherry on top!). A little known comedian in England it was his name that caught my eye when I first saw the cast list! You would have thought that Wilder and Feldman were a well known double act for many years after watching this! Their interactions appear to speak of years of close comedic practice, but it's really the material, direction and acting that gives this seamless impression, and that's not to belittle the excellent interactions of the cast as a whole.

Many prefer the excellent Blazing Saddles (also a top fav), but for me it has to be Young Frankenstein. I think I'll watch it again tonight :0D

P.S. I once briefly met Gene Wilder and I really wished I had thanked him for this, and the other great comedies he made.",1317859200,2,2135,4.452685421994885

Mel Brooks, being the comic genious that he is, really outdoes himself on this gem.  It's quirky, silly, and laugh-out-loud at times.  There's an art to making a film that has what you know is obvious humor coming, and it's still slap-your-knee funny. The actors cast could not have been more perfect, with Marty Feldman in probably one of his most famous and downright hilarious roles.

364338,5,6301797965,"There are so many things to like about Young Frankenstein, which is as much a homage to the Frankenstein legacy as it is a satire. Taking parts from many of the Universal Frankenstein films, (Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, The Son of Frankenstein) Young Frankenstein parodies the most memorable moments from these Universal classics. Unlike many spoofs that have aged, this film is still quite clever, the jokes original and well-timed. There are so many witty lines and memorable scenes.

The cast really makes this film tick. Gene Wilder is such a perfect fit for the grandson of the late Dr. Frankenstein. He attempts to distance himself from the Frankenstein legacy; he pronounces his name ""Fronkenstten"" and dismisses his grandfather's achievements. However, when he learns of a will, and visits the Frankenstein castle and discovers his father's book ""How I Did It"", he is overcome with zealous passion to continue the family legacy. Wilder has such a knack for knowing how to hit the right note for comedic effect. Marty Feldman as Igor is a no-brainer; he has the right physical look, and his mannerisms and level of comic grotesqueness make for some good laughs. Terri Garr is wonderful as the sexy blonde assistant Inga, Madeline Kahn perfectly performs the role of Wilder's fiance, and Peter Boyle embodies the giant-child like monster to a tee. There is also a funny cameo from Gene Hackman as the blind hermit who encounters the monster, a classic scene worth viewing repeatedly.

The extras are quite impressive as well. Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein takes a deeper look at the ideas behind the satire. It explores Wilder's inspiration to create this film, his collaboration with Mel Brooks, the script, and a look at the casting and roles and the vision for the film.  There are also trailers for the film, deleted scenes, interviews, and an optional commentary from Brooks.

A superb comedy that has stood the test of time, and is a tribute to the Frankenstein story, Young Frankenstein never gets old. Any fans of Mary Shelley's classic or the Universal classics should check this one out.",1312156800,,2128,5.019830028328612

I felt silly buying this on blu-ray. Does this film need to be available in a high rez? No. This is a film about jokes, not visuals.

364340,5,6301797965,"It was a dark and stormy night....isnt that how ALL horror movies begin? Well, actually, this isn't a horror movie. Well, I mean, it IS, but it isnt, in that it's a comedy about horror movies. So it's a comedy, and it involves horror, which would technically make it a horror movie, but not really.

 Well, now that we've cleared that up, back to the story:

It was a dark and stormy night........have you ever experienced Deja Vu?  Have you ever experienced Deja Vu?

It was a dark and stormy night (Deja Vu again DeJa Vu again) and Dr Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced ""Fronk-en-steen""...no fooling) after talking to some geek about the re-animation of life, and abusing an old man, without even laying a hand on him, is riding, with Igor (pronounced ""Eye-Gore"")......(I know what you're thinking...""Hasnt everyone pronounced the name as ""Eee-gore""? My response: Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?)......where were we..oh yes, Igor at the wheel....or ropes...or whatever those thingies are that they attach to horses, because they are too lazy to walk like everyone used to in the old days. Riding with Inga, a delicious cookie that I would love to dunk in my ""Varm Ovaltine"",who is part ""looking for a role in the hay"" and part ""Dr Frankenstein's lab assistant"". Her job is to ""raise"" the good Doctor......while he's on the platform that launches the Monster (whom the good, yet demented Doctor has made from a freshly buried body at the cemetary, and a ""brain"" that the ""less than Harvard material"" Igor has retrieved for him)..... into the thunderous sky, in hopes of giving him life.
Which doesnt make sense, because when you're alive you AVOID lightning because it kills, yet when we're dead, apparently we WANT to be hit by lightning? Okay, sounds good to me.

 Anyvay...way...anyway, Dr Frankenstein, the delicious Inga (man would I love to take my ""schwanshtoocker"", or whatever it's called, and, where was I?  Where am I now? Oh rignt,) ....... and Igor, and the Horses are traveling through a forest that looks like a foggy Hollywood sound stage, when all of a sudden it happens....A Howl!

The conversation goes something like this:

(Howl occurs)

Inga: ""Oof..a Verevolf!""

Dr. Frankenstein: ""Werewolf?""

Igor: (pointing) ""THERE wolf""

Dr Frankenstein: ""What?""

Igor: (pointing) ""There wolf,(pointing in different direction) THERE castle""

Dr Frankenstein: ""Why are you talking like that?

Igor: ""I thought you wanted to""

Dr Frankenstein: ""No, I don't want to.""

Igor: ""Suit Yourself, I'm easy"".

As the gang makes it to the castle, they are greeted by the biggest knockers you have ever seen!

And I don't mean Frau Blucher's (Sounds of Horses neighing in background) knockers.

You see, Frau Blucher (Sounds of Horses neighing in the background) is currently, along with some rats the size of elephants, is the only resident of the castle.

 Frau Blucher (Sounds of Horses neighing in background) then gives the gang a tour of the castle, having only an unlit candle to ""illuminate"" the way.

  Did I mention that Igor has a hump?  Indeed, he does. A hump so big that a certain bell ringer at Notre Dame would be green with envy.

 Yes, the hump is on Igor's left...no...right...no wait....the left....no I think it's the right...maybe not........Igor has a hump on his shoulder! Who cares what side it's on?

  Well, I would be here until 2018 if I tried to tell you the rest of the story, so let me say that this movie is one of the funniest movies ever. Some of the jokes are subtle. Some are as obvious as getting slammed in a rotating bookcase.

 The scene where the young girl, a Teeter Totter enthusiast, demands that the Monster gets on the Teeter, or Totter, with her, and suddenly acquires some impressive frequent flyer miles, is hilarious.

 The entire movie is a warm, inviting, campfire of comedic genuis, which horror-comedy transgenre'd people will have a riot watching.

Btw, ever laugh so hard that you actually get dizzy and think you're going to pass out? That scares me.

Well, I've got to go now.

It's been real......insane.

  Then again insane is my middle name.

  Well, actually, my middle name is Carlos Jorge Juan Valdez Gonzalez Rodriguez Conchita Alonzo Martinez Santiago, but my friends call me ""Abbey"". So please call me ""Abbey"".

  Pasta La Visa!

Young Frankenstein (Special Edition).  The movie of course was outstanding.
But the added Extras and Specials and Additions really made it ""come alive!""  (No pun intended - ha, ha!)

I learned that Madeline Kahn came up with the line by the train, ""No Tongues!""  So many great lines.

364350,5,6301797965,"The new Hi-Def transfer used for the Blu-ray disc has more detail, but also suffers form increased film grain.  All of Mel Brook's FOX features suffer from grainy film stock, in this case it is more acceptable as it is a spoof of old horror movies.

One issue I have is the distributor's insistance on rpesenting this in wide-screen.  After producing Blazing Saddles in Color & Anamorphic Widescreen, Mel Brooks wanted to duplicate the style of the 1930's horror films by shooting Young Frankenstein in B&W FULL FRAME.  Mel understood that most theaters could not handle the old Full Frame aspect ratio, so he kept the action within the letterboxed matte but kept the matte open in the cameras so that future showings on TV would include the full square picture.  The original Laserdisc retained this full frame & it feels like watching an old 1930's Frankenstein movie, just like Mel intended.  To add to this frustration, the original deleted scenes from the Laserdisc (& later DVD) are ported over to this Blu-ray in their original un-cropped full frame image.  So you get an idea how this film was intended to be seen.

That said, on to the new to Blu-ray Bonus Material.  After having an abundance of bonus material on the old Laserdsic & DVD, I was surprised to find even more material found for this Blu-ray presentation.  First up is a new set of interviews with Mel & the crew giving more tidbits about the making of the movie.  Intermixed in this are clips from the various original Frankenstein movies that inspired Young Frankenstein.  You get to see what Mel kept & what he changed (I forgot Igor was not the original assistant's name).

Even more out-takes have been found (this time masked for widescreen).  This time we get raw, unedited camera footage of alternate takes or alternate storylines.  This will be the only chance you get driector Mel Brooks in Young Frankenstein as he can be heard giving verbal cues to the actors.  He even pops into frame a few times.  The previous out-takes had already gone through final edit before they were removed from the movie.  These never made it past the raw daily screenings.

So if you are wondering about upgrading your older DVD to this Blu-ray disc, the additional bonus material may be the final push to the Blu-ray disc.  The increase in picture detail & lack of digital artifacting is hindered a bit by the increase in grain, so that may not be enough reason to ungrade.",1277683200,13,2438,4.705188679245283

364375,3,6301797965,"I rarely comment on the quality of Blu-ray transfers, as they're generally excellent. This one has me wondering. Not only is it grainy, but it doesn't /look like/ a B&W film. (A good one, anyway.) The highlights look as if they're approaching ""burnout"", while the black areas aren't really black. And though there are plenty of midrange tones, there's no pleasing gradation gradation between light and dark. ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" was better-photographed.

Worst of all, the image has a yellowish cast, as if my display's color temperature was set too low. But it's a Pioneer Kuro, and they're generally close. Besides, I haven't seen this cast on other B&W films. So I suspected the problems with ""tonal gradation"" were due the film had been shot in color, and printed in B&W.

However... the supplemental materials say the film was shot on B&W stock (AGFA was named, but they likely meant Ilford), and that a well-known cinematographer was hired to provide the kind of classic B&W look Mel Brooks wanted. And guess what -- that's what the scenes in the supplemental material look like! They do not have a color cast, and they have the beautiful gradation of a classic B&W film. Lovely.

Who knows. Fox doesn't have a customer-relations department, so there's no one to ask. The picture is otherwise good, so if you want this disk, you might as well buy it. I will keep trying to find out.

As for the film itself...

I feel about ""Young Frankenstein"" much as I feel about ""Superman II"". The good things in these films are offset by poor directorial decisions. In the case of S2, during the big ""blow-out"" between Superman and the villains, Richard Lester inserts comic moments (of such things as ice cream flying in a man's face, or a person being dragged off by a torn-away pay phone) that are not only unnecessary, but distort the film's tone. As for Mel Brooks, he never heard a crude or vulgar joke he didn't like, * and if he thinks the audience might not ""get"" a joke, he shoves it in its collective face, sometimes repeatedly. Much of Brooks' humor is not only ""obvious"", but he /misses/ the obvious, as well -- why doesn't the film start in color, and switch to B&W when we arrive in Transylvania?

By the way, the ""Transylvania station"" joke is retained. TV cuts often omit it, (apparently) because some people consider it racist..

Most people consider ""Young Frankenstein"" a classic. Perhaps it is, and I'm being overly critical, but I tend to see this glass as half-empty, not half-full. The one thing that is unquestionably classic is Madeline Kahn's performance. It goes beyond perfection, if such a thing were possible.

Parents should be aware that, despite the PG rating, ""Young Frankenstein"" has a fair of amount of crude/vulgar humor and worse, an on-screen rape only /slightly/ less graphic than the one in ""Brokeback Mountain"". The PG-13 rating would be appropriate, but it didn't exist in 1974.

* The issue isn't crude humor, per se, but the quality thereof. ""South Park"" and ""The Venture Bros."" are much better at it, mostly because they go for the jugular.",1256428800,6,3079,4.761726078799249

The whole movie was shot in black and white and incorporates Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein. The movie was played strictly for laughs and it has a lot of them. Some of the on going gags are Igor (pronounced ""Eye-gor"") ever changing hump on his back. On scene it is on the left side and on another scene the right side. Also when ever anyone says the name Frau Blcher or just Blcher, the horses goes wild. Also there are few minor mistakes as well. Gene Wilder role of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein is the grandson of the late Dr. Victor Frankenstein. In one scene; he is referred to as the great-grandson. Also Inspector Kemp right arm is artificial, but when he is searching for the Monster in the woods, it is on the left side. Finally when Dr. Frederick Frankenstein and Inspector Kemp are playing darts, Dr. Frankenstein only throws two darts through the window. When Inspector Kemp heads toward his car and drive off; the scene shows six darts. The movie starts off with the coffin of Baron Beaufort Von Frankenstein, the Great-grandfather of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, being open.  A lawyer for the Frankenstein family is sent to the United States to tell Dr. Frederick Frankenstein that he has inherited his Great-grandfather estate. Dr. Frederick Frankenstein travels to Transylvania and meets up with Igor and Inga. One night Dr. Frankenstein hears music and along with Inga investigate the source of the music. It leads him to his grand-father private libray and the book How I Did It. After reading the book, Dr. Frankenstein believes he can do it as well and did up a body of a recently huge criminal. Igor is sent to the Brain Depository. After dropping the good brain, Igor picks up the adnormal and brings is back to  Dr. Frankenstein. When the creature is bought back to life and goes wild in the lab, given a sedative, Dr. Frankenstein asks Igor whose brain is in the that creature. Igor calmly replies that it is an Abby Normal's brain. Dr. Frankenstein is angry with Igor that he gave him an abnormal brain. The monster escape and we have the blind man scene where his taken in and the blind man does his best to be polite. When the blind man offers the Creature a cigar and tries to light one up for him, he burns the creature thumb and the Creatue leaves screaming. He finally make his way back to the castle where Dr. Frankenstein shows him love and compasion. At an evening gather Dr. Frankenstein shows off The Creature to fellow scientits and doctorts, however, a lightbulb burst and The Creature goes into a fit a rage and is taken into custady. It while The Creature is in custady that the prison guard mocks him and The Creature breaks the chains and escape. Dr. Frankenstein plays music to bring The Creature back to the castle for a serious operation. The operation is a succes and The Creatue is nolonger evil.

364396,5,6301797965,"Yes this Blu-Ray disc is grainy but there's an easy fix for that.

When this film first previewed in 1974 those who watched it in theaters ( that was the only place one could view it at that time ) were amazed at how well Mel Brooks created the mood of a '30's period movie for the modern screen. Using B&W film was important of course, but duplicating the coarse grain of those old films and using a soft-focus technique that gave the film a flat and muted character was the key to its' visual success. Later visual mediums ( tape, Laserdisc, DVD ) had no problem duplicating these important visuals because these mediums had an inherent low-definition character. Then along came Blu-Ray.

Blu-Ray if not done properly will spoil a movie. I have a long list of Blu-Ray titles and watching some of these movies taken to this new 'hi-def' plane of quality is really fun. Patton, The Professionals, Casino Royale are just a few of the really strong transfers to BR. Some others are not so strong and it's disturbing. For all the hype we've been fed about how perfect BR discs were going to be it was just that- hype. It reminds me of the period when vinyl records were being made into CD's: some albums worked well but many suffered badly from the transition. Maybe BR is just like that. Maybe the transfer techniques just have to jell and improve a little more for the quality of the medium to be consistently top-notch.

But enough of my BS'n. Want to know how to turn this great movie into something that resembles the viewing quality in movie houses in the day? It's simple:
Open the adjustment screen of your TV and move all your visual adjustments such as  'picture' ( contrast ), brightness, color and sharpness down to 0 ( or off ). If you can adjust the Gamma or overall density (tone) of your viewing make it lean toward the neutral or flat side. And if you can adjust the color 'feel' of your movies ( cool,normal,warm ) make the setting 'cool'. Now, start the disc. You will notice that the graininess is now 90-95% gone but the picture is maybe too muted in contrast. If that be the case, increase your 'Picture' ( contrast ) setting a little at a time until you reach the point where the whites and blacks are good but not too punchy. Your eyes will soon focus on the action and not the image texture ( I found my best 'picture' setting for YF to be at 25% of normal contrast ).

When you finally reach the point of a watchable setting you will find this movie or any soft-focus movie that's been hurt by BR can be fixed this same way. The best part is movies like YF really benefit from the Blu-Ray transfer process because detail is improved ( apart from the grain problem, of course ) but the sound -even in two channel stereo- is much clearer and now adds to the experience in a much more profound way. Not to mention the 'full HD screen' format that really makes home viewing pleasurable.

Blu-ray truly is the medium of the future for viewing great movies. Maybe it just needs a little time to grow-up. And our understanding of why it works or why it doesn't will help us to fix what's broken. And should others get angry over BR quality try not to join the crowd unless you believe, 'A rrriot't ist a terrrrible thing'k. Und I tink is't about time we had one'!!

Hope my hints are a help. Thanks.",1229644800,6,3315,4.3892508143322475

364401,3,6301797965,"It's a funny thing about comedy; it seems to be of and for its time and very few age very well.  I remember as a kid when I first watched this film that I laughed until I cried.  Then I watched it again a few years ago and I absolutely hated it.  Now after having watched the original Frankenstein movies upon which this spoof is based, I actually like it again as I can compare and see exactly what scene from the original is being spoofed although I have to admit that many of the jokes don't pack as much of a punch as they did when I first watched this film.

This is why I really respect some of the older comedians that can still get a laugh out of me after many, many years such as some of Buster Keaton's (Sherlock Jr.) and especially Charlie Chaplin's work (Modern Times, City Lights, The Gold Rush, The Great Dictator etc) not to mention the Marx Brothers (Duck Soup, and the other movies)too.  I've come to realise that as much as I enjoyed and laughed at scenes from ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Something About Mary"" for example that future generations will probably wonder what the fuss was all about just like the way many of the reviewers with negative reviews feel about this film.  That's why I'm convinced you cannot have a ""funniest comedy of all time!"" as the dvd cover claims here because what is funny for one generation very rarely remains so for another.

Still, this was enjoyable and if you actually go back and watch all the original Frankenstein movies from the very good first two to the much less so others, you'll appreciate this spoof a whole lot more.  Marty Feldman made this film for me as he was still really funny in his role as Igor although the entire cast was excellent and Teri Garr kept reminding me that she was the original Phoebe of ""Friends"" fame in terms of mannerisms and behaviour.

The dvd itself has a few good special features such as a making of documentary and a few interviews but the sound quality is only in Mono and the picture quality hasn't been restored and while ordinarily this would be something to complain about but as Wilder wanted this film to closely resemble the original Frankenstein films one can't really complain as these ""imperfections"" actually achieve the director's goal so to speak.

One of the first great spoofs and certainly funny when it first came out and when I first watched it but now to be fair like most comedies, it has lost much of its hilarity but it is still amusing and very enjoyable if you are also a fan of the old Frankenstein movies.",1225929600,,2528,4.440604751619871

(8.0) Young Frankenstein (1974) - Gene Wilder/Peter Boyle/Marty Feldman/Cloris Leachman/Teri Garr/Kenneth Mars/Madeline Kahn/Gene Hackman

""YOUNG FRANK"" TRIVIA:
This is Gene Wilder's personal favorite.

Many of the same props and lab equipment used in the 1931 original appear here.

The Blind Man's ""espresso"" comment was ad-libbed during rehearsal by Gene Hackman and added to the script.

Marty Feldman also ad-libbed the shifting hump sight gag and his early line ""walk this way"" inspired Steve Tyler of Aerosmith to write a song with the same title.

Mel Brooks made the howling wolf sound effect that's heard during the ride to the castle.

Madeline Kahn refused the part of Inga, which was given to Terri Garr when she proved she could do a German accent.

The skulls found under the castle were real.",1224633600,,1998,6.328413284132841
364415,2,6301797965,"As much as I love this movie, I'm going to have to give this Blu-ray edition only two stars, due to the absurdly excessive grain. Before you jump to the conclusion that I'm clueless on the issue, let me tell you I'm well acquainted with the fact that grain is a feature of the medium itself, and that Blu-ray will reveal more of this grain than what we're used to.  But natural grain is not what I'm talking about here, nor am I talking about any intentional stylized black & white effects. On this disc, some error in the transfer exaggerated the grain, burying the image beneath a layer of teeming dots.

As fans of this movie who saw it in theaters might recall, there are a few scenes in which the graininess of the picture abruptly changes, in instances in which the camera zooms in for a freeze-frame close-up (e.g., when Frederick and Igor first meet). The reason the grain changed is because the zoom is an optical effect achieved in editing. An image was magnified by some process, and the film grain in the original print becomes more apparent as it, too, is magnified. But in this Blu-ray edition, the film is so suffused with speckled noise, the effect of the shift in grain is completely lost. What it means is, this inserted level of grain is eclipsing the original textures.  The close-ups are passable, because the size of the overall image offsets the relative size of the squiggling flecks. However, scenes shot from further away are like monochrome impressions in pointillism. Black and gray particles wriggled in the lighter areas in such bold relief that it completely undermined the picture sharpness and contrast.

Do NOT believe what you might be reading elsewhere, in some reviews by critics laboring under the impression that this graininess was an intentional effect. While the cinematographer certainly set out to mimic the style of the Frankenstein classics, excessive coarse grain was never a feature of those old films. This grain is a flaw.  In transferring the film to the Blu-ray format, a sharpen-image feature similar to that found in common photo software was applied.  You can apply this option only so far, and when overused, the edges become hard. If you apply it to, say, a grainy photograph, the grain of which in the original is a natural feature, all of the details are hardened to the point that the grain itself becomes a bespeckled layer. It becomes too pronounced, sitting in front of the image instead of comprising it. This transfer was degraded by the overzealous application of an image-sharpening tool. And while this next accusation can't be supported with proof, I don't think the original negative was used for this transfer. Nowhere on the packaging is it stated that it was digitally remastered. Instead, the studio upconverted the same digital material used in the previous SD edition. That's what the squiggling grain looks like to me, poor upconversion. The flecks are simply too large to be actual natural grain.  The sharpening made it look different, and your BDP and HDTV will further account for a difference, but it won't be the difference resulting from a faithful transfer.

For some fans, the special features will be worth the price, but for me, the extras aren't enough to overlook this travesty. Nothing I've written here is an exaggeration. Take note that among the reviews here, mine is the first one written after having actually seen THIS edition. Let's see what others after me will have to say.",1223856000,24,3473,4.825210084033613

364417,5,6301797965,"The announcement that Young Frankenstein would be released in Blu-Ray triggered mixed feelings. On the one hand, this is a movie that should be widely available in every format. It's that good. On the other hand, the release of high definition films has spawned yet another generation of empty-headers obsessed with picture quality and ""awesome sound,"" who couldn't tell a good movie from a used diaper. And so, the Internet is littered with glowing ""reviews"" about the spectacular cleanliness of the images on garbage releases like Jumper, So I Married an Axe Murderer, Signs, The 6th Day, Ice Age, and The Rock. It distorts the entire rating system on Amazon by giving four or five stars to trashy movies that happen to look shiny and clean, without ""artifacts"" -- or, it turns out, merit. These same reviewers give high marks to some great films on Blu-Ray, but for all the wrong reasons -- yet another distortion of the ratings system.  (Of course, one could treat movie releases as mere ""products,"" and spend time commenting on how well the hinges work, or how well the packaging is made, or how true the ""blacks"" happen to be. But, why dumb down our culture any further with such dedication to fluff and superficialities? Sure, the studios who are making a mint off of Blu-Ray transfers of lousy films want you to care about such things, but I'll take a VHS of Young Frankenstein on a black and white Philco over a ""glorious"" version of Con Air. So would every other thinking person.)

And so, to get to the point, this is Mel Brooks' shining moment, a film that is a brilliantly funny homage to the classic horror films of the thirties.  Some might complain about the corn content, but it works, and the performances by a stellar cast -- topped by Gene Wilder -- are phenomenal. For more, I defer to Count Orlok '22's spot on review above. If you don't own this film, buy it. In any format.",1220140800,20,1897,4.6398809523809526
364418,5,6301797965,"WARNING: This film may lead to incontinence due to hysterical laughter!

Mel Brooks' 1974 film, Young Frankenstein is arguably the funniest film ever made. Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks, who had previously collaborated on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Producers/dp/B000BMY2LU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Producers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blazing-Saddles/dp/B0001Z4OXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blazing Saddles</a>, wrote the script together. This film is a superbly crafted parody of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Frankenstein/dp/B0001CNRLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Frankenstein</a>&nbsp;films.

The story begins with young Doctor Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen) discovering that he has inherited his great-grandfather's Transylvanian mansion. Upon his arrival Dr. Frankenstein meets Igor (pronounced Eye-Gore), an eccentric servant with a hunched back. He is also introduced to the vivacious vixen, Inga who just wants ""to have a roll in ze hay."" Before long Frederick discovers the secret library of his infamous grandfather, Victor von Frankenstein and becomes totally obsessed with creating a ""monster"" of his own. Naturally this doesn't go over well with the local peasantry. After the monster goes on a rampage of terror (or more accurately a rampage of hilarity), the villagers form an angry mob and set out to destroy it. But don't worry, all's well that ends well in the world of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Brooks/dp/B000E6ESIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Brooks</a>.

The gags in the film are hilarious (I won't ruin them for any of you yet to see the film). The satire is heightened by the brilliance of the set design, and by the black and white cinematography, which perfectly captures the look of classic horror films. The cast is terrific especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gene-Wilder/dp/0312337078/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gene Wilder</a>&nbsp;as the infirm Dr. Frankenstein, Marty Feldman as the zany hunchback Igor, Teri Garr as the delightfully ditzy assistant Inga, Madeline Kahn as Dr. Frankenstein's obnoxious and vain fiance, Kenneth Mars as the one-armed Inspector Kemp, Cloris Leachman as the mysterious Frau Blucher whose name incites terror in the hearts of all horses, and Peter Boyle as the mumbling monster. Also look for a memorable cameo appearance by Gene Hackman.

As often as Young Frankenstein is referred to as being ""the greatest comedy ever"", it's odd that it never received any awards for its talented cast and crew. They certainly deserved them. There are few works of comedic genius out there today, for which I am grateful to Mel Brooks for giving us this loony masterpiece to watch again and again.

The DVD features some great supplemental material including cast interviews, an audio commentary with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Brooks/dp/0470225262/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Brooks</a>&nbsp;reminiscing about the making of the film, production stills, trailers and TV spots, a wonderful documentary, new featurettes, a set-top game, seventeen deleted/extended scenes and an outrageously funny blooper reel (watch the documentary before the blooper reel for maximum effect).

This movie as well as the television show, Get Smart changed my life. And, ironically enough, they were both conceived by ""mad man"" Mel Brooks whose humor is definitely left of center. I think you are either a Mel Brooks fan or you're not. Now, it is true that some of Mel Brooks movies are funnier than others and this is his funniest movie with Blazing Saddles being a very close second.

The scene I loved the most is when ""the monster"" visits the blind man. Oh my, God, Peter Boyle's expressions are positively priceless. And if you don't already know, the blind man is played by Gene Hackman, and if you didn't know, where have you been...in a friggin' closet? I mean the movie is almost 32 years old which means I am almost 42 years old! Good God!

I also love the parts with Madeline Khan and Kenneth Mars. I love the whole movie! It's just too good. I think what makes this movie absolutely brilliant was Brooks decision to film it in black and white and use a lot of the same techniques that James Wale used to create the original Frankenstein. Did you know that the studio execs originally wern't going to back up the film unless Mel Brooks changed his mind and made it in color, instead? Proof positive that just because you may be in a ""high ranking"" position, you don't always know what you're talking about. In fact, the higher you go, the less you probably know...but this is a movie review and not a critique on the ""powers that be"" as well as the ""powers that c, d, and f...""

This movie can pull me out of any kind of slump I may be in. When I was recovering from major back surgery last year I made a list of my favorite movies and my angel of a wife either bought them, rented them, or borrowed them just so I had something to watch. I am glad she made the decision to replace our slowly deteriorating VHS copy of Young Frankenstein with the DVD version.

I do like the extras even though there weren't that many, but you have to take in account that they probably didn't have much footage from back then because this was in the mid 70s and they didn't think that they needed to have all of it saved for future use which is kind of sad when you think about it because they were making a classic and it would've been nice to have a documented record to go along with the movie, but this was long before computer technology and the like really kicked in. Now they have a behind the scenes look at every movie ever made. No, thank you, I don't want to see the doc based on ""Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties""...

So. yeah, get this incredible movie. It truly belongs in every film collection whether or not you're a Mel Brooks fan.

364448,5,6301797965,"This film is one of my all-time favorite Mel Brooks movies. It has been called one of the ten funniest movies ever made, and I am not about to argue that. Everything about this film works. From the casting, to the set pieces, to the dialogue, to the direction, to the soundtrack, everything clicks. One thing in the film's favor: the decision to film in glorious black and white, as in the glory days of Hollywood horror films, which this movie paid direct homage to. The cast was spot on, and you could only imagine the crack-ups that occured after each take. Peter Boyle was wonderful as the Monster, and Gene Wilder was a true genius as Fiedrich Frankenstein. Teri Garr, in an early appearance, is great as Inga, the lab assisant. Marty Feldman lends his maniacal eyes to Igor, giving a rousing performance in the process. Madeleine Kahn, as usual for this great lady, nearly steals the whole show as Dr. Frankenstein's american fiancee. She will forever be remembered for her rendition of ""Love at Last I've Found You"". Overall, one can tell this film was a true labor of love. Every scene is filled with detail, which this DVD release brings into sharp focus. The contrast is wonderful, the sound is sharp, and the film just glows. If Mel Brooks rather crude humor isn't your forte, this film is closer to mainstream than normal for him. As a result, he gave us a true cinema classic, and we thank him for it.",1154822400,2,1414,4.570866141732283
364449,5,6301797965,"Released in 1974, Young Frankenstein is irrefutably one of the funniest movies ever made.  Devotees are quick to recreate favorite scenes and certain lines from the film have insinuated themselves into popular culture.  Never has the phrase, ""Dying is easy, comedy is hard,"" seemed more fitting.  Indeed, anyone who has ever intentionally attempted humor knows it's a whole lot more difficult than it looks.

Viewed in this context, Young Frankenstein is one of those incredibly rare examples of a project where everything goes right.  The best place to begin is with the chemistry between Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder.  Left to his own devices, Brooks is the original loose canon, willing to embrace any outrageous extreme in pursuit of laughs.  Wilder, a far more refined and nuanced artist, is his perfect foil, they balance each other ideally.  (This was also true in The Producers and Blazing Saddles.)

Next is the supporting cast.  Great comic actors are less common than hen's teeth, but Brooks managed to assemble a veritable Who's Who.  Teri Garr, in addition to bringing sex to the picture, has superb comic timing.  Madeline Kahn is as gifted a comedienne as you might ever find, and her flamboyance is irresistible.  Marty Feldman is more than just another pretty face with a moving hump, he delivers.  Actors like Cloris Leachman, Peter Boyle, and Gene Hackman - not known for comedy - rise to the occasion and become funny by virtue of their context.

Next is the discipline.  Brooks and Wilder stay close to the original Mary Shelley story as well as the two famous film versions, even going so far as to locate and use the laboratory set from the 1931 Frankenstein by James Whale.  By making the film an homage to the great monster pictures of early Hollywood, (note the decision to shoot in black and white), Brooks and Wilder created something that is more than just a broad farce, at times it is actually touching.

Architecture firmly in place, the mayhem could begin in earnest.  This is as good a comedy script as you are likely to find anywhere, one-liners zing by with the manic pace of a Marx Brothers movie.  But even the best script can die in the wrong hands, and there are no wrong hands in this film, (not even the dead ones).  From physical humor, to timing, (where comedy lives or dies), to snappy, deadpan delivery of over-the-top dialogue, Young Frankenstein is practicality a masters class in comic acting - plus - these performers are obviously enjoying themselves.  If you were to own just one comedy film, this should be it.  Absolute perfection.",1149984000,3,2583,4.83371298405467

This is director Mel Brooks' hilarious tribute to Mary Shelley's classic novel entitled ""Frankenstein"" (first published 1818) and pokes fun at just about every Frankenstein movie ever made (especially the original 1931 classic).  The screen story and screenplay to this movie were written by Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder.  This movie was filmed in the same castle and with the same props and lab equipment as the original classic.

The plot is simple.  Dr. Frankenstein's grandson (Gene Wilder) who insists his name be pronounced ""Franken-STEEN"" inherits his granddad's castle and repeats his experiments.  He also inherits some people:  a hunchbacked servant named Igor-pronounced ""EYE-gore"" (Marty Feldman), a pretty ""lab assistant"" named Inga (Teri Garr, her claim to fame), and a housekeeper named Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman).  We also meet the grandson's fiance (Madeline Kahn), a blind hermit (Gene Hackman, who was not given billing credit when this movie was originally released in theatres), and the Monster (played with finesse by Peter Boyle).  All these characters create a hilarious spooky spoof that some say is Mel Brooks best movie and that Gene Wilder says is his favorite movie.

The comedy is a mixture between slapstick and outrageous silliness.  There are no cheap jokes but there are plenty of one-liners and sight gags.  I chuckled most of the way through this movie but in some spots, I laughed out loud.

The acting is terrific.  Gene Wilder carries the movie.  (He barely stifles his hysterical laughter at several points.)  Teri Garr adds a sexiness to the movie and presents her trademark humor.  I give special kudos to Marty Feldman for making ""EYE-gore"" such a memorable and funny character.

This movie is filmed in glorious black and white.  The background music adds to each scene.  As well, the cinematography is astounding.

This is a movie you can see over and over without tiring.  In fact, I laughed more when I saw this movie a second time!

Finally, the DVD (Special Edition) itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has several extras, all of them interesting.  Special mention should go to the out-takes/bloopers that I found to be quite funny.

In conclusion, this is a monstrously crazy movie, a truly inspired vision of lunacy!!

364476,4,6301797965,"Mel Brooks won the Oscar for his first film, The Producers.  He followed this up with two moderately successful films.  But in 1974 Mel became the top comedy directors of the time with Blazing Saddles and this film, Young Frankenstein.

This is the ultimate sequel to the classic Frankenstein film (even better than Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein.)  Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) - pronounced Franc-en-steen not Frank-en-stine - is the grandson of the infamous Dr.  But he wants no association with the crackpot ancestor.

But Frederick is beckoned to Transylvania for the reading of his great grandfather's will.  Frederick is met by Igor (Marty Feldman) whose grandfather worked for Frederick's grandfather.  On the trip back with Frederick's new assistant Inga (Teri Garr) they hear a howl (Inga: Werewolf! Igor: There wolf.)  They are met at the castle by Frau Blucker (Cloris Leachman) - whose name is accompanied by screaming horses.

During the night Frederick is awakened by Inga who hears music from behind his bookcases.  This leads them to Victor's private library and Frederick becomes obsessed with his grandfather's diaries.

Frederick has decided to recreate his grandfather's experiment and snatches the body of a recently hung murderer (Peter Boyle).  Igor is sent to the Brain Depository (after 5 p.m. slip brain through slot) to get the brain of a great scientist but he drops it and grabs the brain of Abby Normal - you figure it out.

They are now ready to revive the monster!  But things don't happen as expected.  Well, they happen but not as soon as expected.  Frau Blucker (horse scream!) releases the sleeping giant and here it becomes a warped version of the traditional Frankenstein. But this time they capture the monster and try to rehabilitate him. This leads to a great musical number (Puttin' on the Ritz).  And this goes wrong, of course, and the townspeople chain the monster.

As Frederick and Inga console each other, they really console each other.  What a perfect time for Frederick's fianc&eacute;, Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn), to arrive!  The monster escapes and returns to the castle and finds Elizabeth.  He falls in love with her and abducts her.  And in the most intense sex scene, they make mad passionate love (six or seven times).

Frederick comes up with a final solution, to transfer some his knowledge to the monster.  But Inga wonders what the monster gave Frederick?!

This is a non-stop laugh riot.  This is not the best comedy ever made but one of the wittiest.  Just when you expect a crude joke, the tables are turned.  This is a satire and next to farce, great satire is almost impossible to make and they did it!

Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks made their film debuts in The Producers and respectively, received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination and Best Original Screenplay Oscar.  But neither had great success until they reteamed in this film.  This film would cement their status as comic geniuses.

This would be Marty Feldman's greatest success as he would die a few years later.  Madeline Kahn would become a star for performance here and in Blazing Saddles.

Look, by now everyone who loves movies should know this film.  One of those rare lightning-strikes wherein everything worked wonderfully and the casting created a perfect ensemble.  Hands down the best movie parody Mel Brooks ever made as well as the best looking and most completely consistent in design as well as style.

I don't need to elaborate on story and production, but if you've never seen Young Frankenstein, what have you missed?  How about:

""Walk this way.  No, no, this way.""

""Hump? What hump?""

""Roll, roll, roll in ze hay.""

""Werewolf. There, there wolf.""

""Blucher!""

""Brandy? Some varm milk...perhaps. Ovaltine!""

""Put ze candle beck!""

""Vollowing in his grandvaters vootstheps!""

""Sedagive??!!""

""Abbie Normal""

""He vas my BOYFRIEND!""

""Mmm,oh, you're a mute.  A very Big mute!""

""You take the blonde, I'll take the one in the turban.""

""You little zipper-neck.""

""O sweet mystery of life at last I've found you!""

Out of context, not much.  In context, hilarious.  And the cast!  Gene Wilder does demented, arrogant obsession like no one else.  Terri Garr is yummy.  Marty Feldman absolutely irreplaceable.  Peter Boyle marvelous.  Madeline Kahn the ultimate spoiled ""princess"". Cloris Leachman simply perfect in a small but indelible role. Ken Mars' Inspector is a personal favorite of mine (I have loved his thick German accent since The Producers, and he and Mel get in some jokes here about how some viewers of that film couldn't always understand what his Franz Liebkin was saying).  And last, but not least, the hysterical cameo by Gene Hackman as the Blind Hermit.

Critics tend not to give 5 stars to comedies, probably because every joke doesn't work for everyone.  That is the nature of comedy.  Well that is true here as well, but it is one of the most consistently funny films from beginning to end you'll ever see.  And it is good-hearted, good-natured, and without a mean bone in its body.

364525,5,6301797965,"YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  There are so many things that Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder got right in this film, it is hard to enumerate them.  Suffice it to say that this film, spawned from a real love of the ""Frankenstein"" films of the 1930s, manages to satirize the originals with perfect grace, all the while creating a movie that is strangely touching in its own right.  The comedy is spot-on and I found myself rolling at several points.

The film itself is gorgeous.  It is entirely shot in black & white. It was a great decision to do so, too: the black & white film lends the movie a ""haunted"" feel that transports the audience back to the shadows and gloom of the 1930s originals.  Not only does the B&W film allow us to ""get in the right mood,"" I also believe that it is what contributes to the fact that YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN achieves more than just a simple parody.  As strange as it sounds, particularly when compared to modern parodies, this film manages to tell a touching story.  There is a real human element to this film, despite all of its (hilarious) off-color jokes and humor.

Let me make a few comments on the special features: this is not a  crummy DVD.  There are a bunch of extras that make this edition worthy of buying.  The DVD quality is superb.  Additionally, there is a commentary by Brooks, a 36 minute documentary, outtakes, deleted scenes, and some weird ""Mexican"" interviews.  I particularly enjoyed watching the documentary of how this wonderful film came to the big screen.  It was obviously a labor of love and it shows.

If you enjoy Mel Brooks's films, the original Frankenstein films, or simply a great & timeless comedy, you honestly cannot go wrong with YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.  It holds up after thirty years and will continue to do so for many to come.",1128211200,17,1826,4.569230769230769
364526,5,6301797965,"After having seen ""Blazing Saddles"" in the theater, I was quite anxious to see ""Young Frankenstein.""  I thought ""Blazing Saddles"" was funny, but ""Young Frankenstein"" was even funnier.

Frederick (or possibly FRO-de-rick, as suggested by Igor, played by Marty Feldman) Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has inherited his father's estate.  His father's estate is a gothic castle in Transylvania with secret passages and a basement full of the original ""Frankenstein"" equipment; just the sort of recreation room that any mad scientist would love.  However, Frederick is somewhat straight laced; a doctor set on trying to divorce himself from the Frankenstein name.  However, once he arrives at the castle he seems to become intrigued by being a Frankenstein, and after discovering a book, ""How I Did It,"" he decides it is time to make his own creature.

Inga (nicely played by the beautiful Teri Garr) is Frederick's ditzy blonde laboratory assistant.  Frederick is encouraged by the creepy Frau Bl&uuml;cher (Chloris Leachman).  Frederick is often just as discouraged by the bumbling of slightly dimwitted but witty assistant Igor and by the innocent monster, convincingly played by Peter Boyle.  Filling out the background is Madeline Kahn as Frederick's fianc&eacute;e Elizabeth and Kenneth Mars as Police Inspector Kemp.  Buried deep in the credits is Gene Hackman as the blind man.  Even knowing who was playing the blind man I still had a hard time recognizing Gene Hackman.

The humor in this movie is multi-faceted.  Sometimes the laughs are cheap, other times they are more sophisticated.  Mel Brooks originally cut the scene where Igor says ""...walk this way..."" and Gene Wilder starts to hobble down the stairs on Igor's cane.  However, the scene is one of the best, and most frequently recalled, scenes in the movie.  The scene with the revolving bookcase remains one of my favorite scenes.

There are plenty of one-liners to keep the pace moving.  Werewolf?  There wolf.  You take the blonde and I'll take the one in the turban.  The list of short jokes is lengthy, and nearly all the jokes work.

This movie pays homage to ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Bride of Frankenstein.""  I also read that this movie was a tribute to ""Son of Frankenstein,"" but in the making of on the DVD the first two movies were mentioned and I do not recall the last movie being named.

The special edition DVD contains a wealth of material.  My favorite material was the making-of feature, the out-takes and the bloopers.  The deleted scenes varied from interesting to dull, and in general I found it easy to understand why the scenes were deleted.  The production stills had some interesting prints, but there were also stills that were repetitive and boring.  The variety of trailers included gave potential viewers a good preview of the movie.  There was even a trailer for a re-release, which I did not remember.  There are also some interviews conducted in Mexico that contained some interesting material, and were thankfully short.

""Young Frankenstein"" is a movie that has managed to retain its humor for decades.  The jokes are generally timeless, and most of them are set up well enough to be funny.  There are jokes that fall a little flat, but fortunately these are few.  I attribute much of the quality of this movie to the script that began with Gene Wilder and was modified by Mel Brooks.  The result is one of the best movies that Mel Brooks ever directed, and one of the best movies in which these actors appeared.  This movie is a must-have for fans of comedy and for fans of classic horror films.",1127779200,3,3589,4.94314381270903
364527,5,6301797965,"Piece of trivia:  Aerosmith went to a midnight movie showing of YOung Frankenstein, when they saw Igor say ""Walk this way"" and Gene Wilder followed him exactly ""walking this way"" they thought it was hilarious.  Hence, the title of their famous hit, ""Walk This Way"".

Frankenstein was never meant to be funny, but somehow a genius like Mel Brooks turned it into a classic comedy.  The humor is smutty without offense, silly without being jeuvenile, and timeless.  Here we take the fabled tale of Dr Frankenstein creating his monster and making it a hilarious madcap adventure.  Gene Wilder was at his all time funniest, with his neurotic comedy and screaming fits (of which I modeled my own humor after).  Igor, though no longer with us, was so ugly and revolting that he could've only been an actor playing the weirdo sidekick.  While Terri Garr would go on to play far smarter characters in her career, she was at her buxom airheaded best.  (""Would you like to have a roll in the hay? ... It's fun!  ... Roll!  Roll!  Roll in the hay!"")

This was also Madeline Khan's (though also no longer with us) greatest moment.  She was at her all time funniest as the vain and self centered fiancee of Gene Wilder, then to have her inner sex kitten come out thanks to Peter Boyle's monster's enormous stranstooker.  (And if you have to be told what that is, then maybe this isn't the movie for you.)

The special features are hilarious, as you hear the obvious love and affetion the crew had for this movie.  I was disappointed that Gene Wilder didn't contribute, but then again a lot of comics in real life aren't really ""funny guys"", and perhaps he hardly says a word should you meet him.",1127779200,3,1681,4.587248322147651

With Actors like Gene Wilderman and Marty Feldman how can you possibly go wrong?  If you have ever seen any of the original Frankenstein movies, then you'll absolutely die laughing at this parody.  My particular favorite scene is with Frankenstein and the blind man (Gene Hackman) who attempts to give him soup, drinks and a cigar.  From what I've heard they were able to use the original set pieces from the original Frankenstein, which doesn't necessarily make it a parody, but more of a comical tribute to a classic.  Also, since Mel Brooks always has at least a small character in his movies, he does the voice of the original Doctor Frankenstein in a very small scene.  I didn't realize it was him until my third time watching it.  Also the film was released in 1974 but was filmed in black and white to be like the original Frankenstein and form more humor and effect.

The Putting on the Ritz perfomance is pretty good too.  But it may never have happened if the doctor's assistants in the castle would have opened the door when he was alone with the monster.  ""No matter how terribly I may scream, do NOT open that door!""

In no way is this movie a failure.  ""In science we must learn to accept our successes as well as our failures, with quiet dignity and grace.""",1119139200,2,760,4.5777777777777775

364571,5,6301797965,"In 1974, the same year that Mel Brooks' film ""Blazing Saddles"" was making people laugh at theaters around the world, Mel Brooks teamed with Gene Wilder to write a hilarious film spoof of Mary Shelley's (1797-1851) classic 1818 short story ""Frankenstein"", as well as the many twentieth-century horror films that the story inspired.  The result was the film entitled ""Young Frankenstein"" that Mel Brooks directed and starring Gene Wilder as the fictitious Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, the grandson of the more famous Frankenstein from Shelley's short story.  Frederick, embarrassed by his grandfather's unethical medical practices, pronounced the family name as Fronkensteen to try and disassociate himself from his heritage; but when Frederick inherits the family's castle in Transylvania, he has no choice but to return to the family home.  There, he finds two of his grandfather's assistants still taking care of the castle: Frau Blcher (Cloris Leachman) and Igor (Marty Feldman, 1933-1982).  Engaged to Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn, 1942-1999), Frederick has a beautiful assistant named Igna (Teri Garr).  When word spreads in the nearby town that a Frankenstein has returned to the castle, the townsfolk rally around their local police chief, Police Inspector Hans Wilhelm Friederich Kemp (Kenneth Mars) with his mechanical arm; but Frederick assures them that he is not planning to resume his grandfather's experiments--that is, until he discovers his grandfather's secret diary and decides that he too can create life!

Filmed entirely in black and white, ""Young Frankenstein"" is a classic comedic film that continues to entertain both old and young alike.  With a combination of wonderful acting, hilarious accents (especially those used by Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr and Kenneth Mars) and the exquisitely written plot & dialog, it is unlikely that anyone watching this film will be able to do so with a straight face.  Some of the most hilarious scenes include Inga & Frederick with the secret revolving door, the laboratory scenes, the monster (Peter Boyle) with the old blind man (Gene Hackman), the duet between Frederick and monster singing ""Puttin' on the Ritz"", and Elizabeth transformed into the monster's bride (looking exactly like the bride from the original 1935 ""Bride of Frankenstein"").

364647,4,6301797965,"Young Frankenstein is a cult classic that deserves a wider following.  Director Mel Brooks co-wrote the screenplay with star Gene Wilder.  Mel Brooks is known for satirical comedies such as Men In Tights (1993), Spaceballs (1987), and the Twelve Chairs (1970) among many others.  In YF, Frederick Frankenstein  (Gene Wilder) wants to carry on a quiet life as a college lecturer, but is dogged by the infamous achievement of his late father, Victor Frankenstein, of making a creature out of a corpse.

Frederick travels to Transylvania, leaving his less-than-devoted fiancee (Madeline Kahn), and seeks to visit his father's estate.  He meets the lovely Inga, who is to be his lab assistant (Teri Garr), and the outrageous Igor (Marty Feldman) who gives many of the laughs in the film.  Despite his best self-conditioning, Frederick seeks to recreate his father's work.  The result is a creature or monster (Peter Boyle).  Yes, that is Ray Romano's Dad! The townspeople revolt, with disastrous and funny consequences.

The movie starts out a little slow, but you will soon be in stitches.  I asked my husband just to give YF a chance, and he laughed so hard, and is still quoting lines from the movie today.",1109462400,,1205,4.975
364648,5,6301797965,"Young Frankenstein is the most consistently funny and inspired of Mel Brooks's comedies. A parody of the Universal Frankenstein series of the 1930s and '40s, it features a brilliant performance by Gene Wilder in the title role, supported by British comedian Marty Feldman as a humpbacked assistant (a cross between Dwight Frye's Fritz and Bela Lugosi's Ygor), Kenneth Mars as Inspector Kemp (an homage to Lionel Atwill's Inspector Krogh), Peter Boyle as the Monster, Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher, the housekeeper, and Teri Garr and Madeline Kahn as a naive laboratory assistant and Frankenstein's fiancee, respectively, both looking utterly sumptuous. The cast have a riot with a great script. Look out for Gene Hackman's irresistibly funny cameo, too.

The expressionistic shades and eerie tones of Gerald Hirschfield's lighting and photography capture perfectly the mood of the Universal series, and Wilder and Brooks's screenplay draws wittily from every aspect of the original films. While hilarious, it pays respectful homage to the Frankenstein films rather than getting cheap shots at their expense.

This edition comes with a documentary and Mel Brooks commentary that will only enhance your appreciation of the film. There are some amusing outtakes/bloopers, although admittedly the rather longwinded deleted scenes reveal just how wisely the finished product was edited!",1109462400,3,1383,5.580952380952381

It has it's moments and it did look very well done with stage, props, sets ect. and did look like a classic comedy basedon a classic thriller. But it didn't have the comedy I hoped for.

Still, Mels worst movies are still better then anyone elses best movies.

Gene Wilder is a scientist named Fredrick Frankenstein who experients a corpse to try and reanimate dead tissue that he read from a book in the castle he lives in with Igor.

Of course this might be because a lot of the credit goes to Gene Wilder, who co-wrote the script and plays Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, grandson of the infamous monster maker who finally decides to pick up the family business.

Then there is the first-rate cast, with Peter Boyle as the Monster (""Putting on the Riiittzzzz""), Marty Feldman as Igor (""What hump?""), Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth (""Ah, sweet mystery of life at last you've found me!""), Terri Garr as Inga (""Roll, roll, roll in the hay!"", and Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher (""Neeeeiiigghghh!!!!!""). I even like the film score by John Morris that sets the right tone from start to finish, including the haunting theme that lures the monster back to the castle where he was born (with a nice French horn part for Igor).

But what I really think makes this film work is that there are several scenes that are played absolutely straight, such as when Frederick reclaims his family name and the Monster is tormented in the jail cell. Then there is the doctor's speech at the moment of creation, which stacks up against anything you will find in any of the classic Universal Frankenstein films: ""From that fateful day when stinking bits of slime first crawled from the sea and shouted to the cold stars, 'I am man', our greatest dread has always been the knowledge of our mortality. But tonight, we shall hurl the gauntlet of science into the frightful face of death itself. Tonight, we shall ascend into the heavens. We shall mock the earthquake. We shall command the thunders, and penetrate into the very womb of impervious nature herself!""

Wow. Read that and tell me that Brooks and Wilder did not know what they were doing in this one. Yes, this is a comedy, but it has a strong affection for the films it is spoofing, ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Bride of Frankenstein,"" that comes through in several excellent homages. The extra material included on the DVD shows that Brooks and Wilder left lots of funny shtick on the cutting room floor, which should not surprise anyone.

364653,5,6301797965,"Thirty years later, Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder's YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN remains a classic comedy, filmed with such loving affection for the classic it spoofed.  So much of the humor is played so straight, it becomes even funnier.  All the actors have their own crowning moments, many of which have been reiterated by other reviewers.  But take the film's classic black and white photography and cinematography which evokes the pure essence of the original films.  Gene Wilder is perfect as the heir to the Frankenstein legacy, and his comic timing has never been better.  Marty Feldman is pure magic in his role as Eyegor, the bug-eyed assistant who is lecherous, witty and morose all at the same time.  Teri Garr is brilliant as Inga, the buxom assistant whose German accent is so good it's amazing.  Peter Boyle, barely recognizable under the expert make-up, does wonders with his eyes and his duet with Wilder on ""Puttin on the Ritz"" is superb.  Cloris Leachman is great, but I wish she had more screen time; her Frau Brucher (Neighhh) is a comic masterpiece.  And of course the late Madeline Kahn also brutally underused, is magnificent as Elizabeth, whose roll in the hay with the Monster is tremendous.  Gene Hackman in his cameo as the blind man is top notch; only an irritating Kenneth Mars ""mars"" the perfect casting.

364654,5,6301797965,"Thirty years have not tarnished the unequivocal hilarity of Mel Brooks' send-up of classic 1930's horror movies. With stiff competition from ""The Producers"" and ""Blazing Saddles"", classics in their own right, this is arguably Mel Brooks' comedy high watermark. This masterwork is just one of those serendipitous circumstances when all the elements work beautifully and in just the right amounts. First, there are the visual elements...the sharp black-and-white cinematography by Gerald Hirschfeld and the authentic-looking production design and set decoration by Dale Hennesy and Bob De Vestal. Then there is the endlessly clever script by Brooks and star Gene Wilder, which ranges from broad slapstick and farce to bawdy burlesque humor to sharp irreverent satire. They have written a king's ransom in funny lines that have since become part of comedy film lore...""Werewolf?...There wolf. There castle.""...""He vas my...boyfriend!""...""It's Eye-gor""...""""Put...the candle...back"".

The casting is impeccable. As Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced ""Fronk-en-steen"" to escape his ""cuckoo"" bloodline), Wilder balances his trademark wide-eyed innocence with the character's monomaniacal drive with perfect aplomb. Teri Garr and cross-eyed, bug-eyed Marty Feldman lend able comic support as Inga and Igor, the doctor's nubile ""laboratory assistant"" (""Roll, roll, roll in da hay"") and the hunchback, inexplicably British footman (""What hump?""), respectively. Kenneth Mars has a funny turn as the police inspector, looking very much like a direct cousin of his Fhrer-loving Franz Liebkind in ""The Producers"". Deglamorized to the point of being heroic, Cloris Leachman is wonderfully over-the-top as Frau Blcher, still holding a torch for the original Dr. Frankenstein and whose very name makes the horses whinny in fear. Of course, she did a variation of this role in Brooks' later ""High Anxiety"" as the evil Nurse Diesel. Peter Boyle, well before his paternal curmudgeon on ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", makes a lovably menacing monster, his fearful nature offset by a soft-shoe turn with Wilder on ""Puttin' on the Ritz"". An almost unrecognizable  Gene Hackman provides a memorably riotous cameo as Harold, the blind monk ready to make espresso for his new friend. Even with all this keen competition, Madeline Kahn still stands out as Elizabeth, the doctor's high-maintenance fiance, who in one of the most hilarious scenes, gets seduced by the monster and climaxes with a rendition of ""Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life"" that would make Jeanette McDonald blush. Just about everything she says gives me an uncontrollable case of the giggles. She is well missed.

The DVD has several worthwhile extras such as a few deleted scenes and outtakes, including a ridiculous ""Actor's Parade"" sequence that has no purpose but to make the entire cast pass by the camera. There is also a 36-minute making-of documentary, which is informative, entertaining and includes even more outtakes. There are also a couple of oddly amusing Mexican TV interviews with Feldman, Wilder and Leachman. This is a true comedy classic well worth owning and watching over and over again.",1106006400,,3143,5.53014553014553
364685,5,6301797965,"A lot of comedy gets dated. For instance, the SNL skits that I used to love as a kid now are just plain... well... lame. 'Seinfeld', while great for its time, needs to be taken off the air and put away before it gets played out by the networks like 'Cheers' and 'Mash'. So that's where I am coming from when thinking about older comedy. This is not the case with Young Frankenstein.

The movie is flat out funny. Gene Wilder couldn't have been better in this film and the fact that it's black and white only adds to the feeling of the movie. Definitely recommend this over other Mel Brooks films as well (Blazing Saddles, Space Balls, Robinhood- Men in Tights, etc.)",1104796800,3,666,4.414634146341464

The film is chock full of great set pieces and double entendres(when I first saw this as a child I didn't get most of them).  There is also a classic scene with Gene Hackman in an unbilled cameo.  The ensemble cast is one of the best ever assembled for a comedy.  Gene Wilder achieves just the right tone as Victor Frankenstein.  Teri Garr is voluptuous and funny as his assistant Inga.

364690,5,6301797965,"I saw Young Frankenstein a long time ago, and thought it was really funny.  I've recently seen FOR THE FIRST TIME the original Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein.  After having seen these classics, I can truly appreciate all of the jokes in Young Frankenstein, as well as see what a totally LOVING tribute this movie of Mel's is to the first three Frankenstein classics.  For example, I thought Kenneth Mars's character with his wooden arm was just some wacky Mel Brooks thing - but, no, the inspector in ""Son of"" had a wooden arm just like Kenneth's, and the inspector and Dr. Frankenstein played darts in ""Son of"" too.

One little weird coinky-dink which I just discovered tonight regards Madeline Kahn's singing of ""Oh sweet mystery of life at last I've found you..."" after she and the monster make love.  Well, what's funny about this is that this song is from a movie called ""Naughty Marietta"" which happens to co-star Elsa Lanchester, the original BRIDE whom Madeline is parodying!  (I've been watching anything with Elsa in it ever since I saw Bride.)

See the three original Frankensteins, then revisit (or see for the first time) Young Frankenstein.  It becames crystal clear what a brilliant film Young F. is.  And, for shear Mel Brooks wackiness that has nothing to do with any of the three Frankenstein movies, you've gotta love the ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" scene.  I don't want to spoil it, I'll just say it will leave you grabbing your sides with tears rolling down your cheeks.

364691,4,6301797965,"Yes, it's hilarious. But it's not perfect. The mugging done for the camera (by Wilder and Boyle, especially) ruins the sense of ""I'm watching something that's just very funny"" and turns it into ""I'm watching actors self-consciously ham it up.""

The gist of this movie is that it is a retelling of the Frankenstein Monster's story from Shelley. If you've read the book AND seen the classic movies with Karloff and Lancaster, then there are multiple points of similarity and allusion. You will indeed laugh. But there are moments when the best you can do is grimace at the weak elements. And sadly, Cloris Leachman (""High Anxiety"") is very poorly used. She has a few funny lines, but she is a much better actress than this movie shows. (The ""Frau Bluecher"" gag was funny the first 4 times, but by the 5th time it was tiresome.)

One thing that Mel Brooks has done well is to hire good music resources. The theme of ""Young Frankenstein"" is clever and fits the ""fake"" and the ""real"" setting well. It's mysterious and still faintly derisive. (""High Anxiety"" is another movie with great scoring.)

Gene Wilder (who came up with the idea for the film) and Mel Brooks collaborated to put together this spoof on Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's classic ""Frankenstein"" where the twentieth century descendant, Dr. Frederick ""Fronkensteen"", of the late Dr. Victor Frankenstein arrives in Transylvania from America and creates his own monster, ""...vallowing een ees gandfadda's vootshtaps"" (Inspector Kemp's wording for ""following in his grandfather's footsteps"").

 In the 1970s when every movie made during that time was filmed only in color. Brooks wanted the movie to be filmed in black and white to correspond well with the original 1931 classic. Critics suggested that the movie be filmed in color. They predicted that if it were filmed in B&W, it would become a disaster. Brooks proved his critics wrong and it became an instant success at the box office throughout the world. This proved to be the inspiration for later movies filmed in B&W such as ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" (1982) starring Steve Martin and ""Schindler's List"" (1993) starring Liam Neeson.

 Thirty years to the day have passed since the making of ""Young Frankenstein"" which still remains an all time classic with the zany characters of Wilder, Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, Teri Garr, Cloris Leachman with her role as Frau Blcher (whinny!), and Peter Boyle as the monster.

No sooner are the words out of his mouth then we hear a terrific crash of thunder, then see lightning, and then the skies open up. Then Igor says: ""I have a hunch..."" This is so funny it can make you sick from laughing; when Peter Boyle, as Frankenstein's Monster, launches into his famous ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" you are pretty much over the edge and barely able to breathe any more. One of my favorite lines is when Igor is driving Wilder to the Castle and there is a howl in the distance; Wilder says nervously: ""What was that?"" And Igor replies: ""Werewolf."" Wilder: ""Werewolf?"" Igor: ""There...wolf.""
Feldman, Wilder and Cloris Leachman are wonderful in this, and it was shot, appropriately, in black and white. I was fortunate enough to be at the studio when this was being shot and went onto the set and opened a door in the Castle and there were Peter Boyle, Wilder and Feldman all sitting around a table, taking a break...and Boyle had the most sickening shade of green make-up all over his face; he looked terrific. the sets were fantastic, and it was a thrill to be allowed to see them all.

364782,5,6301797965,"The son of Dr. Frankenstein is trying to find his fathers work and complete it.  He travels to Transalvania and meets up with his assistant, Igor.  Igor's father worked with Dr. Frankenstein's father a long time ago.  One night when Dr. Frankenstein couldn't sleep, he heard a violin noise behind his wall.  He found out that there was secret passageway down to a room.  He followed the sound of the violin and it led him to a laboratory and in the next room was the violin lying on the table.  He realized he was in his fathers secret library.  He wanted to finish the work his father never finished, which was to transfer a brain into a dead body and bring it back to life.  Dr. Frankenstein asked Igor to get the brain of a specific person.  As Igor was in the lab, he dropped the designated brain and just took an abnormal brain thinking it was a person named ""Abby.""
  Dr. Frankenstein added the brain into the head and didn't realize that it was an abnormal brain until the monster had woken up angry.  The monster ran out of the house into the village.  The only sound that calmed down the monster was the violin playing.  Dr. Frankenstein and Igor set up a trap and played the violin to lead him back to the castle.  In the meantime the towns people are getting suspicions that there is a monster inside the castle so they come over.
  Dr. Frankentstein and the monster were set up to transfer brains and 3/4 of the way in, the towns' people raid into the castle and stopped the transformation.  The monster had half of Dr. Frankenstein's knowledge and Dr. Frankenstein had half of the monster's knowledge.  They talk the towns people into leaving and they leave.

364783,5,6301797965,"One of Mel Brooks' most fully formed and aesthetically realized films, the comedy YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a clever amalgamation of classic gothic horror and bawdy burlesque humor.  Though it is replete with raucous slapstick and riotous dialogue, Brooks' insistence that his crew recreate the look and aesthetic quality of the Universal horror films of the 1930s--specifically FRANKENSTEIN (1931), BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935), and SON OF FRANKENSTEIN (1939)--makes the movie as much a loving tribute to those films as a parody of them.  The script is outrageously witty yet well-structured and literate, and Brooks' direction is more stylish and restrained than usual, enabling him to extract uniformly excellent performances from his all-star cast.  YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN will certainly go down in the annals of movie history as co-writer/director Mel Brooks' magnum opus, and it will likely be at the top of the list of accomplishments for co-writer/star Gene Wilder, too.
Wilder portrays Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (he pronounces it ""FRONK-en-steen""), a bumbling but arrogant med-school professor who, despite his vehement disavowal of his infamous monster-making ancestry, finds himself forced to claim his inheritance of the family's Transylvanian castle.  Though he at first plans to dispose of the property, discovery of his grandfather's notebooks stirs the ol' genes and leads him to reconsider.  Soon the temptation of forbidden knowledge proves too strong to resist, and Frederick--with help from his assistant Inga (the beautiful Teri Garr), his servant Igor (that's ""EYE-gore,"" played by bug-eyed Marty Feldman), and his housekeeper Frau Blcher (a delightfully over-the-top Cloris Leachman)--sets out to build a monster (Peter Boyle) of his own.
Under Brooks' direction, Wilder, Garr, Feldman, and Leachman make an outstanding and outrageously funny comedy ensemble.  And Peter Boyle's portrayal of the monster arguably rivals that of Karloff himself.  But an equal amount credit for YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN's success should go to the excellent supporting cast.  The late Madeline Kahn is at the top of her comedic form playing Elizabeth, Frederick's sexually repressed fiance.  As Police Inspector Hans Wilhelm Friederich Kemp, Kenneth Mars creates a hilarious caricature of SON OF FRANKENSTEIN's prosthetically limbed Inspector Krogh, and though he has only a small part, accomplished thespian Gene Hackman shows off his comedic chops with his hysterical send-up of the blind hermit who befriends the monster in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.
As mentioned before, Brooks insisted that his crew reproduce the aesthetic feel of the Universal's classic FRANKENSTEIN films, and his crew certainly delivered.  Gerald Hirschfeld's beautiful black-and-white cinematography, when combined with Dale Hennesy's production design and Robert De Vestel's set decoration, exquisitely recreates that classic gothic ambiance of the original films, and the haunting music from John Morris provides a perfect underscore to YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN's plot, characters, and imagery.  Although copyright restrictions prevented exact duplication of the look of Universal's classic monster--YOUNG FRANKESTEIN is a Twentieth Century Fox film--the character make-up created by Ed Butterworth and William Tuttle that is a breathtakingly skillful and recognizable takeoff on the original.  In many ways, Brooks and his crew deliver a film that, though a comedy, aesthetically and stylistically fits right in with Universal's 1930s horror lineup.
Even though the DVD from Twentieth Century Fox offers a non-anamorphic widescreen version of the film, the picture is fairly crisp and reveals lots of detail not clearly visible in the previous VHS releases.  The disc also has lots of entertaining extras, including a sometimes humorous feature commentary with Brooks, outrageously funny trailers and TV & radio spots, interesting and revealing deleted scenes, and more.
In short, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a funny and loving homage to the golden age of gothic horror films, and it deserves an honored place in the DVD collections of all serious horror fans, especially those who love the old classics of the '30s and '40s.",1081728000,5,4180,5.70096463022508

Gene Wilder plays Frederic Frankenstein (he pronounces it ""Fronkensteen"") who is the beneficiary of his late uncle's work on reanimating the dead after he ventures to Transylvania.
Included in the stellar cast are the bug-eyed Marty Feldman as Igor (he pronounces it ""Eye-gor""), Madeline Kahn as Wilder's prudish fiancee, Terri Garr as his somewhat dim-witted lab assistant, Kenneth Mars as the jack-booted local constable, and last--but certainly not least--Peter Boyle as the monster.
One hilarious scene follows another in this movie as Wildman tries to succeed where is ancestors have failed.  It was pretty funny when, during a town meeting, one of the citizens mentions that they have gone through this sort of thing nine times before.  Talk about shell shock!
Other great scenes include ""Abby Normal,"" Elizabeth's 'violation' (her ""woof"" is a hoot), the vaudeville dancing, and the dungeon dialogue between Wilder and Boyle.

364837,5,6301797965,"""The scariest comedy of all time!"" boasted the poster taglines for ""Young Frankenstein."" When a tagline pokes fun at itself, you know you're in for a real treat. Such is the case with Mel Brooks' ""Young Frankenstein,"" one of the greatest of all comedies and one of the only modern day films able to convince me from the start that I really was watching an old 30s film, and not a film made in 1974.
Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder are both fans of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein,"" and so when they collaborated to write the screenplay for ""Young Frankenstein,"" I can only assume that it was a fun experience for both of them. They reworked the story of Frankenstein and his monster into a smart, occasionally hilarious, always enjoyable, classic comedy that helped put Brooks on the map after ""The Producers"" (""Blazing Saddles"" also helped quite a bit).
Some fans of ""Frankenstein"" could consider the film almost sacrilegious, I suppose, but that wouldn't be fair. It's not a poke at any flaws in ""Frankenstein"" -- it's a well-thought-out continuation of Baron von Frankenstein's legacy, with an added pinch of slapstick comedy thrown in for good measure.
Gene Wilder is Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (""Frahnk-un-steen,"" not ""Frank-en-steyn""), grandson of the crazy old loon Baron von Frankenstein, who attempted to re-animate dead matter in his creepy mansion in Transylvania years ago. Frederick is a successful neurosurgeon, eager to put his past behind him. When a student asks him questions about his grandfather and research into re-animation, he is quick to change the subject.
Then he inherits his grandfather's castle in Transylvania and makes the long, weary journey there to acquire ownership. Greeted by Igor (pronounced ""Eegor,"" not ""Eyegor""), Frederick Frankenstein is soon haunted by his grandfather's interests. I guess the craving for re-animating dead tissue is just something that runs in one's blood!
He stumbles upon an old chamber underneath the crumbling mansion, home to an assortment of odd inventions and textbooks (including ""How I Did It,"" by Baron von Frankenstein, which is a bit of an in-joke for readers of Mary Shelley's story -- they'll understand the joke, perhaps, more than most audiences).
After finding a dead body in a graveyard and accidentally inserting an ""Abby Normal"" brain into it from the help of Igor (Marty Feldman), Frederick Frankenstein creates a new Monster (Peter Boyle), who is taken into custody by the townspeople and then escapes, finding an old blind man (Gene Hackman) in a cabin somewhere. He then kidnaps Frederick's bride to take her as his own and Frederick realizes that he must put an end to the Monster before everything in his life falls apart.
There isn't much to say about a film like this. The comedy works, the style works, everything about it works. It's classic. Everything in it is classic Mel Brooks comedy.
I suppose the accounts of Brooks' and Wilder's off-screen fights during filming are pretty well known. In one instance, Brooks got so mad at Wilder that he threw an object at him. Later he called Wilder and said, ""Who was that jerk that threw that thing at you today? He should be fired!""
It was because the two minds clashed together. Both being extreme fans of ""Frankenstein,"" I suppose both men had their own unique opinions as to what, exactly, the film should be about, and what, exactly, should happen in it. But for whatever the reason, despite all their arguments the film has turned into a masterpiece.
Wilder's performance is extraordinary. After turning Leo Bloom (""The Producers"") into a nervous, paranoid, timid man, Wilder does a 180 here and makes Frankenstein into a self-assured, mean, forthright character -- giving us the feeling that he's been hassled his entire lifetime by nosy reporters researching into his grandfather's case, and he's tired of it.
Filmed on-location in the original ""Frankenstein"" set, the film partly works because of its respect for the old horror films. The famous Universal horrors from the 1930s and 40s are spoofed in this film, and that is primarily is what truly makes it stand out from the other films in the genre. But Brooks and Wilder don't insult them. They compliment them and poke fun with them -- not at them.
Brooks tried this formula once again in 1995 with ""Dracula: Dead and Loving it!"", which starred Leslie Nielsen as Count Dracula, although the outcome was not as smart as ""Young Frankenstein"" and not as convincing. Brooks did a great thing by filming ""Young Frankenstein"" in grainy 30-style black and white, reminiscent of old films such as ""Dracula"" or ""The Wolf Man"" or ""Frankenstein"" itself (not coincidentally, Brooks makes more than a few references to other Universal horror films, too). Part of the greatness of this film is the manner in which it is filmed. I can't imagine ""Young Frankenstein"" in color. But then again, I can't really imagine ""Spaceballs"" in black and white...",1072742400,3,4927,4.995133819951338
364838,5,6301797965,"This is one of the best comedies ever made. I watched it over and over for years, memorizing every joke when I was 12 years old. Everyone in my family did, which led to some very silly dinner conversations. (""You made the yummy sound."" ""No I didn't."")
Now it's out of DVD. Instead of just transferring it to DVD from the VHS tapes, the filmmakers made sure it looks good. And they added a lot of really impressive extras. The documentary features everyone except Mel Brooks. He's on the audio track. I learned that the story started with Gene Wilder, but Brooks was the guy with ""the vision"" --- filming it as if it was a REAL Universal horror movie. They even used some of the old Frankenstein props for the laboratory.
The outtakes are great. Marty Feldman was an underrated comedian. He steals every scene he's in. (Just watch Gene Wilder and Teri Garr scrunch up their lips to avoid laughing whenever he says a line.) The rest of the cast is very funny, including Cloris Leachman's deadpan delivery and Kenneth Mars twisting his fake arm around. There are even a few poignant moments that work surprisingly well, like the monster's speech about the gift of life.
The best thing about it is the way Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder combine acting silly and playing it straight --- the black and white photography, the sets, and even the pace are a perfect match for the old Universal (and Hammer) horror films.

Frankenstein is considered film literature.  It was required watching in school, just like ""Great Expectation"" is required reading.  All movie buffs know of Frankenstein (played by Boris Karloff in 1931) and trivia questions and jokes are made of it.  Now, this film, Young Frankenstein is of the genius writing by Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks.  Produced by Michael Groskoff.  Directed by Mel Brooks.  Released by 20th Century Fox in December 1974.  This fine film is a spoof of the Frankenstein films.  It is a comedy, you may laugh at it all that you want to.  It was made for laughter.  The excellent cast: Gene Wilder, Peter Boyle, Marty Feldman, Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr and the lovely Madeline Kahn.  Gene Hackman plays the blind man.  I wish Gene Wilder could have been nominated for an Academy Award for Outstanding Actor, but him and Mel Brooks were nominated for Outstanding Screenplay.  The film was also nominated for Best Sound.  1974 was a tough year for Oscar.  So many wonderful films were shown.  In the special features, there is 16 minutes of deleted scenes and 5 minutes of outtakes.  There are mexican interviews with Marty Feldman, Gene Wilder and Chris Leachman.  A 36-minute documentary ""Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein"".  By the way, there is an in-joke for you if you click on ""Television Spots"".

364885,5,6301797965,"It is a credit to director Mel Brooks and to Gene Wilder, co-author of the screenplay, that this film has lost none of his comic impact since it was first released almost 30 years ago. Seeing it and The Producers (1968) again recently, I was reminded of  the fact that Brooks' best comedies are those in which he does not appear. Also, I was again impressed by Brooks's respectful treatment of the original material (i.e. Mary Godwin Shelley's novel),  more so than any of the earlier film versions, notably one starring Boris Karloff as The Monster.

What else to say? The ensemble cast of Brooks regulars (Boyle, Kahn, Leachman, Mars, and Wilder) are all outstanding, joined by Marty Feldman, Terri Garr, and a surprisingly effective Gene Hackman as the Blind Hermit. In only a few other films has Hackman's gift for comedy been utilized. The ones I recall are three of the Superman films, Get Shorty (1995), and The Birdcage (1996): to a lesser extent in Unforgiven (1992) and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).

Nonetheless, the irrepressible Brooks could not resist the temptation to add some special seasoning of his own such as, for example, the schtick involving the word Blucher. (Frau Blucher finally admits that the late Henry Frankenstein was her ""boyfriend""). As Brooks well knew, Gebhard von Blucher was a Prussian field marshal during the Napoleonic wars, infamous for his abuse of horses. (Following retirement from military service, his mental health was questioned when he claimed that he was pregnant with an elephant after being raped by a French grenadier. Such a claim could indeed raise questions.) Igor's shifting hump is also vintage Brooks as are the scenes when Frederick von Frankenstein (Fronk-un-STEEN!) bids farewell to Elizabeth (Kahn) before his train departs and then later when Inga (Garr) is happily ""rolling, rolling, rolling in the hay"" wagon.

However, Brooks never allows such zaniness to overcome (obliterate?) the flow of the narrative as is sometimes the case in his other comedies. Although it may be difficult to believe, there is great dignity in this film which never serves as a target for ridicule. (That is what I meant earlier when suggesting that Brooks and Wilder are respectful of the original.) Even the slapstick (slapschtick?) such as it is helps to advance the plot.

For these and other reasons, this is my favorite Brooks comedy.",1057190400,10,2383,5.035532994923858

I don't think there's ever been a more perfect ensemble cast in a comedy: Wilder, Leachman, Kahn, etc. Each of them at the top of their game delivering comedic gems ranging from the subversive to the coarse. And all of it gut-achingly funny.
Brooks is at the top of his game here, too -- deftly combining the performances, the writing. and the b/w-style of the 1930s (down to the eye lights and soft focus close-ups) to create a brilliant and funny masterpiece.
Plus the excellent DVD tranfer and bonus features make this a must-have title.",1055548800,2,823,4.7622377622377625
364887,5,6301797965,"As I sit here and listen to the opening theme from Mel Brook's ""Young Frankenstein"", the strings stir my soul and remind me why I love this movie so much.
Being an absolute ""Frankenstein"" fan (Mary Shelley's classic is my all-time favorite novel), it is logical, to say the least, that I became so amazed at the treatment the original Shelley story was given by Gene Wilder (and Mel Brooks, who took on this screenplay and gave it life). Wilder's 'take' on this science fiction classic (penned by a nineteen-year-old!) shows his sincerity and love for Shelley's timeless story of man's neverending yet sometime tragic desire to emulate his creator. The characters rendered in ""Young Frankenstein"" serve a two-fold purpose (in my opinion): To remind us all of our own mistakes, no matter how grand or petty...We all do really stupid things in life---it's our nature as imperfect beings to do so. The second purpose, simply enough, is to make us laugh at those mistakes. The character Frederick's realization of this culminates at the end of the film, as all is well---or, well-endowed as his new bride soon finds out.
The entire cast of this film brought so much talent to the telling of this story that I'm sometimes amazed that they even finished the film without having laughed themselves to death. Fortunately, this comedy masterpiece was put into the capable hands of Mel Brooks, and we're all better off because of it.
If you have seen this film and haven't laughed, then you seriously might want to seek therapy: you've obviously got a lot of repressed anger and cynicism and would do well to heed the words of ""Puttin' On The Ritz"" (as sung by Gene Wilder and bellowed by Peter Boyle in one of the movie's funniest scenes).
Those of us who love this film know full well the merit of its' attraction and comedic genius. ""Young Frankenstein"" is truly one CAN'T MISS and MUST HAVE films you will ever see.",1055289600,6,1909,4.7357357357357355

364889,4,6301797965,"First, let me begin by saying that the only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that I wanted a bit more from the commentary track, as I indicate below.
The content of this wonderful movie is covered amply elsewhere, so I won't repeat what others have so well synopsized. I WOULD like to point out a couple of things about this particular DVD:
1) The commentary track is accessible from the the LANGUAGE SELECTION menu, rather than from the special features menu (as is usual for commentary tracks). I was terribly frustrated by this until I got some help from Christian at boldopinions.com (thanks Christian!).
2) Yes, the commentary track IS mostly Mel babbling, but there are some nice tidbits here (many of the cut-away shots were put in because Gene Wilder kept breaking, Mel thought ""Puttin' On The Ritz"" was frivolous, etc.). It's also heart-breaking to hear about how Marty Feldman's health habits led to his death at age 59. Unfortunately, since Mel's commentary leans toward the personal, we don't get to hear about the roots of the dart-throwing scene (practically a duplication of a scene in ""Son of Frankenstein"")-- and I would SWEAR that the trees going by the window in the Transylvanian train sequence are the same ones in the train sequence in ""Son of Frankenstein."" So we can't have everything.
3) The documentary is really wonderful-- it's obvious that everyone has warm feelings about the film, and the recollections are sharp and insightful. It gives the movie added dimension, so don't pass it over.
I haven't seen mention in the Amazon reviews of ""Young Frankenstein"" the multiple homages to ""Son of Frankenstein,"" not the least of which is Gene Wilder's spot-on lord-of-the-manor affectations through many of the early Transylvanian sequences (in his grandfather's bedroom: ""And where is my grandfather's PRIVATE library?...[book snatched from shelf] Why, these books are all very general [snap snap snap the pages]; any doctor might have them in his study [SLAP book closed]"" and the entirety of the aforementioned dart-throwing scene (in which Wilder is positively CHANNELING Basil Rathbone). So make ""Son of Frankenstein"" ALSO required viewing prior to seeing ""Young Frankenstein.""
Finally, I think that Mel hits the nail on the head when he says (repeatedly) that so many scenes are emotional at the same time that they're being funny. This film was made with such love by all concerned, and it shows. Yes, it can be occasionally crass, and go for obvious cheap laughs (albeit MUCH less so than any movie Mel has made before or since), but what one ultimately takes away from this movie is the incredible amount of care everyone took with the project. Hell, you might even find yourself with a tear in your eye at the end (I did-- the awesome score by John Morris helps a lot!). Alas, Mel and Gene were never again to collaborate on a script (it is amazing that the Borscht Belt comedy of Mel Brooks and the hopeless romanticism of Gene Wilder found such fertile creative ground in the first place!), so this movie is lightning in a bottle (pun intended).

-All of the performers absolutely nailed their roles. I had forgotten Gene Hackmans classic performance. Outstanding!!
-""Widescreen Review"" gives the DVD 3.5 picture and 2.0 sound quality ratings.
-I would disagree. This is a Spoof of the classic ""Frankensteins Monster"". I believe this film was recorded in mono to mimic the feal of the original.
-The picture quality is actually quite clear.
-The extras are better-than-average for a DVD of this price.
-Included are deleted scenes and outakes. The ""Parade of the Actors"" is wonderfully zany!! Great stuff!!
-Great for Halloween when you would rather laugh than cringe.
-Not for young kids. They wouldn't get the jokes anyway.

364960,5,6301797965,"Young Frankenstein is easily one of the funniest films ever made. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered. It spoofs Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein perfectly. It is so funny that I garantee you'll wet your pants. The only reason not to like this is if you consider yourself to good for the low-budget slapstick movies, or if you have no sense of humor at all, because each of the jokes are perfectly delivered.

364961,5,6301797965,"Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) wants nothing more than his job teaching biology at the university, the love of his life Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn), and to put behind him the legacy of his grandfather, the infamous Baron Viktor von Frankenstein. He never planned on inheriting his ancestral castle complete with assistants (Marty Feldman, Terri Garr, Cloris Leachman). He never planned on finding his grandfather's notes . He didn't plan to reanimate a corpse (Peter Boyle) with an abnormal brain. And he certainly didn't plan for said corpse to get loose...
Put that way, this hardly sounds like a comedy at all. Ah, but Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks, like Dr. Frankenstein, have deftly grafted inspired lunacy to a touching and solid story and given their creation life. Wordplay, slapstick, innuedno, sight gags and cinema's most memorable musical scene combine in a hilarious brew. Yet it is the original core, the story of the deformed oucast and the creator who ultimately redeem each other, that keeps it all from simply being vaudeville. Peter and Gene are fabulous at being silly and sincere simultaneously.
On to the extras! The trailers and production stills are nice, standard fare. The outakes are little disappointing. Several of the clips are close-up shots of a single performer, the camera never moving, so we hear the cast and crew cracking up, but don't always understand why. Some of the deleted scenes were pretty funny, and a shame they didn't make it into the final cut. The making of documentary interviews several of the key figures and does a good job of exposing what exactly it took to make the film. (Note to techno-geeks: not much detail on special effects, if that's your thing.) Also, there a couple of interviews done for a Mexican studio with Marty and Gene (don't worry, they also speak English).
Did you ever watch old home movies with, say, an uncle who'd reminisce and sometimes just make silly comments about what's going on? OK, now imagine that your uncle is Mel Brooks and that his home movie is this multi-million dollar spectacle. That's what the comentary track is like. It was really neat to hear not only what Mel had in mind for the various scenes, but his unabashed adulation at the creative talent he had to work with. He even talks about the fellow who plays Inspector Kemp's chauffeur!
All in all, a wonderful movie with a good helping of juicy extras.",1046822400,5,2405,4.882640586797066

Also the scene at the station where he asks the boy, ""Pardon me boy, is this the Transylvania station?"" Then of course, Inga who asks him from the back of the wagon, ""Dr Frankenstein, vould you like a roll in ze hay?"" and of course on the way to the castle, when the howl of a wolf is heard and Frederick says rhetorically ""werewolf"" whereupon Igor responds with some irritation, ""There wolf"", pointing to the woods, ""and there castle"", pointing straight ahead.  There's also the redoubtable Frau Buchler, who insists on bringing him something to drink before he retires: ""Brandy? Visky? Ovaltine? Varm Milk?"" and the dramatic scene where the mystery of the violin player starts to unravel and she confesses, hysterically, ""Yes! Yes! Yes! He vass my ... boyfriend!"" The scene at the Bucharest Academy of Science where Frederick demonstrates the talents of the ""monster"" is a highlight among highlights, especially when the two of them start to tap dance and sing ""Putting on the Ritz."" Finally, Frederick's wicked smile when after the wedding ceremony, Inga asks him what he received in return for giving the monster some of his precious brain fluid.

365057,5,6301797965,"Mel Brooks' tribute to the Frankenstein movies of the 40s is done with such love, such skill, and such side-splitting, fall-on-the-floor hilarity, that it has rightfully become a comedy classic. I first saw it in a movie theater: I had no idea what it was, had very little knowledge of Mel Brooks at the time, and expected to be bored. Instead, I found myself shrieking aloud with laughter that became so intense, I missed many of the major lines. Hence the video.
What can I say? From the wild-eyed Igor, the hunchbacked Transylvanian servant whose hump keeps changing from side to side, to the modern-day descendant of Baron von Frankenstein, determined not to follow in his great-grandfather's nefarious footsteps, to the nurse, a naif with enormous...er...chestal appendages, to the fearsome Frau Bleucher, whose mere mention causes horses in the castle's faraway stables to neigh in fear...to the scene of the monster and his creator singing and dancing in black tie to ""putting on the Ritz,"" this movie should come with a warning: ""Danger--Uncontrollable Laughter May Become Chronic.""
The cast is beyond superb. The late, wonderful British comedian Marty Feldman (Igor), who turned his congenital wandering eyes into comedic foils, never misses a beat as second banana to Gene Wilder, who plays the distraught Dr. Frankenstein to the hilt and beyond. Cloris Leachman, who looks like a cross between a witch and a warlock, plays the feared housekeeper Frau Bleucher (neighhh!!!), and a very young, beautiful, and buxom Teri Garr plays the nurse-assistant to the good doctor. Then there is the marvelous Madeline Kahn, who gave a bravura performance as the doctor's fiancee. The late comedienne's burst into operatic ecstasy during her rape by the monster is simply inspired, and is one of the comedic high points of the entire film. All of Kahn's considerable talents came into play during this movie; she was taken from us too soon.
In my view, nobody should be without their own copy of Young Frankenstein. View it alone, view it with a group of friends (all of whom will have their favorite ""movie moments""), view it with your children. But by all means, do view it!",1025481600,2,2174,5.00828729281768

What a incredible imagination and sense of humor Mel Brooks has, he really outdid himself with this movie. Peter Boyle really surprised me with his performance as the monster, his performance was very believable and perfect in every way. Gene Wilder as the young doctor Frederick Frankenstein was hilarious, charming, witty and original, he fit the part so well. Marty Feldman as the hunchback Igor was hilarious in every sense, I could not stop laughing whenever he was in a scene. It has a lot of adult humor in it, so I would not really recommend it to younger children, but other than that this great blend of humor, comedy and romance is one to be treasured and watched again and again for years to come. Another great thing about this movie is that they used the original Frankenstein set, I loved that. Another great thing about the movie is that it had so many memorable lines such as:

You're curious about the extra stuff, but not much is learned here - save from the fact that Mel Brooks alludes to the possibility of an affair by Gene Wilder with Teri Garr while filming.
Actually, the Mel Brooks commentary is great. It's interesting to listen to him as a director, and not a zany comedian. It gives an insight into this aspect of his personality, and is worth listening to.
The documentary is okay, but not groundbreaking. It seems pretty half-heartedly put together, without really getting into the nuts and bolts of how the movie was filmed.
The outtakes are somewhat amusing. Once. I doubt I'll ever watch them again. I guess it's nice to have - to watch Wilder, Feldman, et al break character and laugh - but once you've seen it once - there's no real reason to watch it again.
The movie is a classic, however. And worth owning and watching multiple times. Just don't anticipate too much out of the extra stuff on the disc.",1023148800,4,1038,4.55614973262032

The movie, parodying all the Universal Frankenstein films but mostly Bride and Son of Frankenstein, is one of the funniest horror parodies ever made. A particular highlight is the Gene Hackman blind man scene which parodies the beautiful blind man scene in The Bride of Frankenstein. Another highlight is the Puttin' on the Ritz routine. Gene Wilder is wonderful as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (or Frahnk-on-steen), with more vivid characterizations by Peter Boyle as the Monster and Marty Feldman as the horny hunchback Igor (or Aye-gor).
The DVD's highlights include a documentary, ""Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein"", in which Wilder tells how he got the idea for the movie and how Mel Brooks was adamant about certain parts of what he wanted, and Spanish interviews with Gene Wilder, Cloris Leachman, and Marty Feldman. Also interesting is Mel Brooks' commentary, in which he comments that Marty Feldman was a vegetarian, but he drank black coffee, ate butter, eggs and salt and smoked four packs of cigarettes a day, which contributed to his not being able to survive food poisoning from a shellfish in Mexico.

365120,5,6301797965,"Ah, yes... this is the month for me to once again watch some of those great old movies that have, over the years, become staunch favorites. This week it was one of my favorite comedies of all time:  ""Young Frankenstein.""

""Young Frankenstein"" stars  (among others) Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Teri Garr, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, and Kenneth Mars; the movie was written by Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks and directed by Brooks.  This is a film widely recognized as one of the funniest comedies ever produced in Hollywood. In addition, it's also a brilliantly conceived, hilarious parody of the best and worst of all those old Frankenstein movies produced by Hollywood.

It's based on the nineteenth century novel ""Frankenstein,"" the classic nineteenth century gothic novel written by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley... but with a wickedly funny, satirical  twist.  Our story is set in modern-day (late twentieth century) times; our protagonist is the scion of the latest generations of Frankensteins, an American neurosurgeon and college professor named Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (played by Gene Wilder.)  Our protagonist is the grandson of the infamous Dr. Viktor Frankenstein, that nefarious Transylvanian scientist who dug up graves, exhumed dead bodies, and tried to bring those corpses back to life.  The heir to the Frankenstein fortune, Dr. F. travels to Transylvania where he's soon transfixed by his grandfather's twisted scientific work...

The film is a 1 hour, 45 minute-long series of well timed jokes - many of them subtle, and others very broad in nature, all brought together to perfection by an ensemble cast that delivers their lines to perfection.  Many of the jokes probably shouldn't be as funny as they are, and probably wouldn't be if they weren't so expertly timed by Wilder, Feldman, Garr, Mars, and Boyle.  It's obvious that the cast had a lot of fun making this movie.  And when the cast has fun... well, the audience  is in for a real treat!!

For those who have seen the movie at least once, who can forget those oft-quoted scenes between Dr. F and Inga:  ""What knockers!""  ""Thank you, Doctor!"" and  ""Put the candle BECK!!""?  Or how about the uproarious scene (my personal favorite) between the monster and the blind hermit (played by, of all people, Gene Hackman)? Or the wooden-armed Police Inspector Kemp's (Kenneth Mars) interview with Dr. F over an errant game of darts?  Or the arrival of Dr. F's fiance (or is that ""financier?"" or ""finance?) :  DR. F: ""Eyegore, would you help with the bags?""  IGOR: ""Soitanly, mahster... you take the blonde and I'll take the one in the toiban!!""

If you've never seen ""Young Frankenstein"", it bears close watching the first time you see it.  That's because, in addition to the broad and sometimes coarse jokes, there are a lot of very subtle gags throughout the film as well.  A few of the jokes may be unfamiliar to those who have never seen the classic old-time ""Frankenstein"" films... especially ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein.""  Don't worry though... there's enough humor in this zany film to keep every viewer laughing for long after the final credits have rolled.

Since its release in 1974, ""Young Frankenstein"" has become a classic... one of the most oft-quoted films in history.  It ranks number 13 on the American Film Institute's list of ""Funniest American Movies of All Time.""  Folks, if you're one of those few people who haven't done so yet, you just gotta see ""Young Frankenstein"" to appreciate the wonderful humor interspersed throughout!!",1016236800,9,3549,5.049828178694158

Fans of the original Frankenstein trilogy (Frankenstein, Son of and Bride of..) will recognize where Mel got his inspiration (OK, he stole shamelessly).

Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher (""He was my boyfriend!"") and Teri Garr as Inga (""Roll, roll, roll in za hay"") are the perfect foils for the main joke (""All his organs would have to be increased in size"") Kenneth Mars and Peter Boyle round out the players.

In fact, Wilder deserves a lot of praise as Mel Brooks' ""everyman"" though he can sometimes play the role so straight, he loses himself to the kooks all around him.

For those who aren't familiar with Mel Brooks, some of his credits include ""Blazing Saddles"", ""The Producers"", and ""Spaceballs"" - just to name a few. But 'Young Frankenstein' is by far, his best.
It stars Gene Wilder, who plays the mad Dr. Frankenstein...or should I say Fraunkenstein (inside joke). Then we've got Terri Garr, who plays Inga, his assistant and more. Madeline Kahn plays the fiance, Marty Feldman as eyegor, and Peter Boyle as the monster.
To tell you the truth, I think Marty Feldman is the heart of the movie! He's great. Everyone's great really, but Marty, he was the best!
When you watch this, it feels like you're watching an actual classic 1930's movie! The film is shot in black and white, and it has a good score. Some of the actual lab equipment used in the original Frankenstein was used in this!
And the comedy speaks for itself! I highly recommend! Don't just rent it, by it! I'd go for the DVD. It's packed with special features, like a nice long 'the making of' featurette, outtakes, and deleted scenes.",1011225600,5,1221,4.605504587155964

365208,5,6301797965,"I am sure that Mel Brooks played the major role in directing this movie, helping to secure from the actors the very best performances, as well as adding certain more crude enhancements to the script. Undoubtedly, he made many other contributions I am not aware of. He also had the sense to insist, despite studio pressures, that the film be made in black and white.
However, the real driving force, inspiration and heart of this movie was Gene Wilder. As this Special Edition DVD makes clear, Gene Wilder came up with the story; Wilder also wrote the initial drafts of the script, with Brooks joining him to help rewrite and finalize it. Brooks gets screen co-credit with Wilder for both the story and the script, but it is clear that that most of it sprang from Wilder. It was Wilder who insisted, and fought for, the ""Puttin on the Ritz"" scene--Wilder-type humor, not Brook's. (Brooks was inclined to eliminate it) ""It's pronounced 'Fronk - ken - steen', not 'Fran - ken - stein'"" was in the original script, written by Wilder. That conceit, that denial of his ""famous and infamous"" grandfather, as well as his own tendencies as a Frankenstein, is the ongoing joke that makes the movie work hilariously.
It is Wilder's contribution, as an actor, that also makes this movie: his superb facial expressions, his ironic, exaggerated, sarcastic performace is the essence of the movie's denial-styled humor. (On the other hand, if Brooks is responsible for those fantastic close-ups, maybe I am being unfair) I am not trying to detract from Mr. Brook's undeniable talents, but it bothers me that he seems to get the majority of the credit for this movie. Compare Young Frankenstein to other Brook's films, none of them nearly as good. Ask yourself: was History of the Word and Blazing Saddles done by the same man that did Young Frankenstein? There are many who love Blazing Saddles; it was, after all, a hit, and many consider it a good, very funny film. By any measure, however, it lacks the sophistication, cleverness and classic quality of Young Frankenstein.

365209,5,6301797965,"Young Frankenstein is Mel Brooks' crowning achievment. He would never again reach these great comedic heights ever again in his career.

This movie, although released in the mid 70's, is filmed in great black and white. It was a great touch that added the mystique of the film. It wouldn't work again until 1994 when Tim Burton did it for his masterpiece film ""Ed Wood"". The cast and performances are inspiring. A young Teri Garr is mighty catching in her finely tuned comedic performance. The great Marty Feldman co-stars as Igor, who doesn't seem to notice the rather large hump on his back. Then there's Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher(thanks Paul). She is one of our finer female comedians. There's even a cameo by Gene Hackman. Lastly, we come to Peter Boyle. A great actor who gives a knee slapping performance as the monster. The dance sequence to the song ""Putting On The Ritz"" still makes me laugh just thinking about it. Lucky for us, we get to see more of his comedic talent every week on ""Everybody Loves Raymond"".

365214,5,6301797965,"Ever wonder about what might have happened to the journals kept by the infamous Dr. Frankenstein, or the notes he must have made while conducting his ill-advised experiments, attempting to reanimate dead tissue?  And what of his descendants?  How would his legacy of horror have affected them a few generations down the line?  Well, ponder no more, because these questions and many more are finally answered forevermore in Young Frankenstein, an hilarious parody directed by Mel Brooks.  Dr. Frankensteins great-grandson, Frederick (Gene Wilder), is a doctor and teacher whose research has gained him some renown in his own right, and he has done his best to disassociate himself with the tarnished reputation of his ancestor (he even pronounces his name Fronk-en-Steen).  Then one day he is notified that he has inherited his great-grandfathers estate, including the castle, in which the elder doctors laboratory has been preserved.  Frederick, of course, must go to Transylvania to settle his affairs; but the whole affair soon becomes unsettled when Frederick discovers that it is impossible to escape his destiny.  And once he arrives, the die is cast and there is just no turning back, as he can no longer deny that his... name... is... FRANKENSTEIN!
 On his own, Mel Brooks is usually good, even great, but when he teams up with Gene Wilder it becomes something extra-special, which first became apparent with The Producers, in 1967.  But the directness with which Brooks approaches this material, combined with Wilders understated performance makes this their all-time best.  They co-wrote the screenplay, and with their differing perspectives of comedy they managed to capture the best of both worlds and strike a balance that works to perfection here.  Brooks hits you over the head and gets right in your face with a gag, but Wilder steps aside, grabs it by the tail and hits the pause button (so-to-speak), just long enough to really put the joke across.  Together they're like the ying and yang of the comedic universe.  The screenplay is clever and includes all of the elements that successfully evoke the essence of the old B&W horror films that are such a part of cinematic lore today.  What they give you with this film is the Frankenstein story with contemporary sensibilities, while presenting a cast of characters that take it over the top.
 As far as the performances go, nobody, but nobody could have played Frederick better than Gene Wilder.  He employs that prolonged, meaningful pause of his (nobody does it better), which he usually accentuates with a slight shifting of the eyes-- just before he delivers a line-- that can make even a mediocre line hilarious.  His subtle approach and staid countenance play this material perfectly, and complimented by Brooks straight ahead direction it allows the humor to flow naturally and freely and never fails to get the right kind of laugh at just the right time.  The way they capture the sense of the original Frankenstein (and the many sequels) is uncanny, from the overall look of the film to the reactions by everyone at the mere mention of the monster, to the throng of anxious villagers led by the unfaltering and inarticulate Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars).
 Besides Wilder, who is clearly the star of the show, the supporting performances turned in by this superlative ensemble cast are absolutely impeccable, beginning with Peter Boyle as the monster.  Boyle has the gait and the growl down pat, but also conveys so much with his expressions and introspective comportment.  Then there is Marty Feldman as Igor (thats EYE-gore), whose bug-eyed portrayal of the little hunchback who refuses to acknowledge his hump (mainly because he doesnt realize he actually has one) is hilarious.  Teri Garr is a joy to behold as Inga, Fredericks lab assistant, and Cloris Leachman practically steals the show as Frau Blucher (and don't say her name within earshot of the horses).  Mars also creates a memorable character by putting a mumble and a wooden arm to especially riotous use, and last but not least is the wonderful Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth, Fredericks intended who ultimately finds something grand to sing about.
 Also included in the supporting cast are Richard Haydn (Herr Falkstein), Liam Dunn (Mr. Hilltop), Danny Goldman (in a memorable bit as a medical student who challenges Frederick during a lab demonstration), Anne Beesley (Little Girl), Michael Fox (Villager) and Gene Hackman in an uproarious cameo as Harold, the Blind Man.  Often a parody of this nature wears thin after awhile, and even the best rarely manages to maintain a level of excellence for even thirty or forty minutes, let alone for 105 minutes as this one does.  And without question, Young Frankenstein delivers on a level to which few films of this nature can even aspire.  Arguably one of Mel Brooks best-- if not THE best hes ever done-- and with a definitive performance by Gene Wilder, this parody takes a place among the all time greats in the history of the cinema.

365267,5,6301797965,"Mel Brooks' ""Young Frankenstein"" is a remarkable film: it is a spoof of a beloved classic (the original film version of ""Frankenstein"") which is now a beloved classic in its own right. A fun homage to YF was rendered by the irreverent sci-fi series ""Farscape,"" in which wisecracking lead character Crichton referred to a sinister alien adversary as ""Frau Blucher""--the name of Cloris Leachman's YF character.
YF is both a spoof and a sequel of the original ""Frankenstein"" film. It concerns a young scientist (the brilliant Gene Wilder) who is heir to both the name and legacy of the infamous scientist who created a monster from dead human remains. Young Frankenstein takes up the family tradition with outrageously funny results.
Several elements combine to make YF one of cinema's all-time great comedies: witty dialogue, deliciously eccentric characters, hilarious sight gags (""Put--the candle--back""), and one of the best comic ensembles ever assembled on film. On top of that, the production design, costumes, and make-up brilliantly evoke the classic Hollywood ""monster movie"" vibe. And there's a great humorous song-and-dance sequence for the doctor and his creation.
As funny as it is, YF is also a deeply compassionate and humanistic film. Brooks treats his zany collection of characters with genuine affection. ""Young Frankenstein"" ultimately has a kind-heartedness to match both its intelligence and wit.",993600000,6,1415,5.407239819004525

Special mention must be given to Gene Wilder giving one of his most classic performances of his strangled-fury schtick ever (""Put... the candle... back!!!"") and to Peter Boyle, for his very poignant and funny depiction of the Monster.
But standing above all of the end in terms of sheer brilliance is Madeline Kahn, giving what must be the funniest female performace ever on film as Frankenstein's fiancee and the monster's eventual bride. Unlike everyone else in the film, she's not really parodying anyone other than herself; yet nevertheless her depiction of Elizabeth, the wealthy prude who discovers she's a volcano of passion undeneath, is so funny I'm practically crying almost every time I see this film. There's one brief little scene where she's brushing her hair in her boudoir before the Monster steals into her room and kidnaps her, and for absolutely no apparent reason(which makes the scene all the funnier) she's giving vent to a deeply lusty rendition of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" while brushing out her hair.

The only more funny thing is when Frankenstein goes out into our environment and meets everyone. For example. A young girls parents suspect that their girl is in trouble, and she is playing with Frankenstein.

Maybe it's just me, but I hardly laughed at all.  Most of the jokes in this one just weren't that funny.  Maybe it's the fact that I've never seen any of the Frankenstein movie and so I didn't catch most of the parody.  Plus, I was expecting a little more slapstick.
The acting, though, was brilliant.  Gene Wilder as young Dr. Frankenstein (he now pronounces it FRAHNK-en-steen to separate himself from his grandfather), Teri Garr as his assistant Inga, and Marty Feldman as Igor (Eye-gore) were spectacular.  The interaction between these three main characters were what made the movie entertaining.  The supporting cast was brilliant, too.  I got the impression, though, that these were the characters that provided a lot of the jokes that seemed to be missing.
On another note, I thought the use of black and white film was very effective in setting the mood and getting the viewer into the right frame of mind.

Gene Wilder and himself wrote a screenplay that is filled with many memeorable lines that to this day still remain funny. That's the sign of any good movie, whether it's a comedy or drama. If, after 20 or 25 years a movie can still make you laugh and still seem fresh, it truly is a classic. Dr. Friedrich Von Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is sent to transylvania where he has inherited his grandfather's castle. But he must leave behind the one woman he loves, the only problem is he can't touch her,Elizabeth (Played by the ""late"" Madeline Kahn). Once in transylvania he meets enough oddballs to keep you laughing for nearly two hours, like his new assisant, Igor, ""My grandfather use to work for your grandfather. Of course the rates have gone up."" Then there's Inga (Terri Garr) whom Wilder needs to ""elevate"" him. But, none of this can be complete without Frau Blucher ( did anyone hear horses in the background?). The odd thing about her of course is, she likes the walk around a dark castle with a candle holder that isn't lit. And when the townspeople are afraid that Wilder is continuing his grandfather's work, they send for Inspector Klemp (Played perfectly by Kenneth Mars) and only has one arm that actually works.

This is no simple parody.  Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder are paying tribute to the old Frankenstein  films. The atmosphere of the original is lovingly recreated and the  charcters and script also reveal an extremely detailed knowledge. It is  obvious that both Brooks and Wilder are big fans of the original movies, as  I am. Mel Brooks's Star Wars parody, Spaceballs, by comparison is pathetic  because there is no real love or familiarity with the original material.
Gene Wilder is perfect as the manic Doctor, Peter Boyle impressive as  the monster, but perhaps the two funniest performances are by Marty  Feldmann, whose physiognomy perfectly combines horror and comedy, and  Kenneth Mars as the heel-clicking Inspector Kemp, probably the funniest  German accent ever.

Fortunately, this IS a Mel Brooks film, and that means  that whether or not you're an intellectual, you are going to laugh yourself  silly.  As ""Spaceballs"" was for sci-fi fans, ""Blazing  Saddles"" was for fans of the western, and ""Dracula: Dead and  Loving It"" spoofed Dracula movies, ""Young Frankenstein"" is a  lively send-up of old Frankenstein films.
Now I'll tell you something you  may not know, and to which you won't say ""duh.""
Aside from all  the absolutely gut-bustingly funny gags, one-liners, and performances (for  the cast is entirely flawless; even Peter Boyle gets maximum mileage out of  the Monster), it is interesting to note that even the craft of the film  mimics those Universal Monster movies of the forties and fifties.  From the  breathtaking cinematography to the Oscar-winning sound effects (I'm certain  it was the horse whinny after each mention of Bleucher's name that clinched  it with the voters who had tears of mirth streaming from their eyes), every  aspect of the film cries ""This is not a spoof -- it's a genuine  monster film!""  The makeup, the set design...everything.  The film is  virtually flawless, and even outdoes Brooks' ""Springtime for  Hitler"" as the funniest film/continuous stream of laughter-producing  gags of all his work.
If it were possible, I would continue to gush  praise for this comic gem, but, alas, I must continue with my work here at  home, for my assistant has just returned with the necessary organs...er...  Nix that last part folks...

A couple of scenes that are  rightfully cut such as the reading of the will that would have explained  the beginning better, but definitely dragged on. A shorten version of them  should have been left in. A whole series of scenes that made Gene Wilder's  and Terry Garr's 'intellectual discussions' a running gag that definitely  should have been left in, they are hilarious. The outtakes are okay, they  could have included more, and only about 10 minutes worth is included. The  documentary has more and you get the feeling that a whole film could be  made from just the outtakes. The commentary by Brooks in very good, he adds  bits about the scenes, actors and other trivia that is enlightening. He  isn't too verbose and he doesn't run out of things to say, both of which  are common in other commentaries. Production photos are also included which  I have never gotten much from. Finally, there are included two interviews  with a Mexican newscaster which I found a bit weird and had me wondering  what they were all about. A Mexican news team must have been visiting the  film site. They are amusing in their own right, but doesn't do much but  take up space.

This was something that people use to do in black and  white movies (probably so the sets wouldn't catch fire). But the audience  expects the candles to be lit, so the mind doesn't think anything of it at  first glance. Madeline Kahn works beautifully with Gene Wilder in this  movie as his self absorbed fiance Elizabeth who is more concerned with her  appearance being ruined than the fact that she won't see her husband to be  for a while.

It promised to be digitally remastered and have  some extra stuff after the movie, which it did. But, the overall quality  was a bit amiss. For example, for some reason the black outs between scenes  are too lengthy, often cutting out some footage. The most disturbing place  this happens is after Wilder exclaims, ""IT. COULD. WORK!

Another one is earlier  when Frahnkensteen is leaving on the train and Madelein Kahn is left to  cough in the thick steam.

This made me laugh so  hard I  think that I almost exploded. (This review was written with the assistance  of John Vicars III, future movie critic.)",943574400,,631,4.933333333333334
