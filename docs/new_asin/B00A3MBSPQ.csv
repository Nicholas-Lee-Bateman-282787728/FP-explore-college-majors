5381276,5,B00A3MBSPQ,I love this movie and i believe this what a great story. I think that everybody see this movie gay or Bi see this movie.... U get my 5 star and great movie see this year.,1345766400,,170,3.75
5381277,4,B00A3MBSPQ,"The movie has heart, I love that it tip toed in to the down, dirt and ugliness, I wish it had lived there a bit longer instead of wrapping up the serious issues in a 30 minute sitcom fashion. All in all it was a good movie and I like the fact the characters did not settle for less Great job Patrick!!!! I do wonder why every character with a speaking part but two was of a caramel complexion or lighter.",1344902400,,404,4.0
5381278,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"I have watched a lot of movies via Amazon video library and never felt compelled to write a review, until now. Patrick-Ian Polk has done it again!! I did not think he could out-do himself with ""Noah's Arc"" but he has in this film.  ""The Skinny"" has a realism that I can relate and understand because the movie setting is east coast, New York City.  The club scene, the street scene, and even the pride parade festival is realistic.  The storyline of the characters are brilliantly written. ""The Skinny"" is a definite must add to my DVD collection. The first time I saw this movie was on the Logo network.  Unfortunately, Logo has a policy that place limits on language and sexual graphics, so I was a little disappointed in how that network presented the film but intrigued enough to hunt it down to watch without limits. To my amazement, Amazon video has it.  I love how Patrick-Ian has actors from past films such as ""Noah's Arc"" and ""Finding Me."" Everything about this film is amazing and I highly recommend adding it to your video collection.",1344470400,6,1046,4.602150537634409
5381279,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"OUTSTANDING BLACK GAY MOVIE, LOGO NEEDS TO BRING THIS TO THE NETWORK AS A SERIES AND ALSO NOAH'S ARC.. STORYLINE IS HONEST AND TRUE TO YOUNG GAY BLACK MEN.",1344038400,13,155,4.379310344827586
5381280,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"This movie was absolutely brilliant.  I didn't like some of the feminine acts of the characters at first but once I got into the story lines, I was intrigued. So much of this movie tells a story about what happens when love takes over, and when lust is present. Each chatacter brought something different to mind as they engaged in every scene.  Sabastain experienced what happens at a lot of gay prides and gatherings when drugs are involved. Magnus' love is so strong in this movie. Kyle is beautiful, and outgoing. Joey is somewhat shy and knowledgable at the same time. Langston (the girl) is georgeous, and lovable, and loves her gay boy friends.  They have such a strong bond, even after dissappointment takes place. I learned a lot from viewing this movie for a second time in two days. There were things that i missed in the first viewing. Thank you for such a great piece of work.  I will add it to my movie list for future viewings!",1343174400,30,942,4.523529411764706

5381284,5,B00A3MBSPQ,Very good story about a group of gay friends and how most of them look out for each other when 4 friends come to visit their friend for a New York gay pride weekend. Plus in very small rolls are two of my favorite actors Darryl Stephens and Wilson Cruz.,1466640000,,253,4.08
5381285,3,B00A3MBSPQ,"Not his best work. PIP seems to think only one type of gay Black Man lives in America and this film glorifies that. In fact ALL his films do that,  he's like Tyler Perry in that respect. Patrick Ivan Polk IS that real gay version of Tyler Perry if TP came out And Made Gay Films. Oh well it was OK just not great. Watch for the cameos of three actual porn ""stars"".",1465516800,,364,3.9863013698630136

5381291,4,B00A3MBSPQ,"One of Jussie Smollett's 1st gay and out roles! Some of the characters in the movie lacked depth! Also some of the acting was subpar, but the overall movie makes up for the lacking areas! I will say the Skinny could have used a little more fat, but there was enough seasoning to make it palatable! I would've actually rated it 3 1/2 stars, but I couldn't so I rounded up!",1449878400,,371,4.23943661971831
5381292,4,B00A3MBSPQ,"Maybe 3 and 3/4 stars.  Still, I enjoyed this more than I expected.  I bought it based on others' reviews.  Most of the acting is solid, making the education the viewer gets seem like a natural part of the overall story.  It's not preachy.  I learned a couple of things, too.  There are strands in the story (characters' thinking and expectations) that seemed a little unrealistic but didn't greatly reduce my enjoyment of the film.",1449792000,,432,4.693333333333333
5381293,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"A great kiki!!! Such smart, hilarious, zany and beautiful people of color all in one film. This world is rarely depicted in popular culture. It's the kind of film that one can easily watch several times with different friends-- remembering lines and punchlines by heart. The director, same as Noah's Arc, is an important voice that we should not be missing. I look majorly forward to his next film!!",1449100800,,399,4.797101449275362

5381296,4,B00A3MBSPQ,"This was the first movie I have seen Jussie Smollett in (before ""Empire"").  He did
a credible job, as the ""wronged boyfriend"".  I liked that, when his friend was in
trouble, he railed the others around to help.  I would recommend this movie to
my friends.",1440374400,,255,4.5
5381297,1,B00A3MBSPQ,"I'm surprised that there are so many good reviews for this. I'm even more surprised that this movie was written by the same director of Noah's Arc. This is like a watered-down version of what Noah's Arc was but what The Skinny could never be. This movie is painful. None of the characters/actors had chemistry, it was so forced. The token lesbian friend was extremely annoying and was just there. She added nothing to the plot and to the dynamic with her gay friends. The acting is awful, so dry, emotionless, flat, and terribly awkward. In areas where you really needed to feel for the characters, the acting was so bad and the dialogue was so rough that you got...nothing, because there was nothing. There wasn't any depth anywhere - not in the characters, not in the relationships, and not in the friendships. All that this movie centered on was the sex, as if nothing else happens in their lives but sex. The plot had some potential with the barely-there romance elements, but that also went nowhere. Kind of ironic that it's called ""The Skinny"" because this movie was thin on so many levels.",1440201600,3,1096,4.654639175257732
5381298,2,B00A3MBSPQ,"I'll give this movie a C-. The writing could have been a lot stronger and I'm tired of the same gay storylines. Patrik Ian Polk can do so much better, he already has.",1439164800,,166,4.0606060606060606
5381299,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"He is such a great actor!  I love him.  Empire really picked a great actor because he is so comfortable in his skin, cool and laid back in whatever he plays and is just simply gorgeous...",1438560000,,187,4.166666666666667

5381311,4,B00A3MBSPQ,"I have just finished watching this movie. More visibility for the Brown skin/Black LGB and T community, thank you! What an authentic way to show friendship between five individuals whom all visit one another for the New York Gay Pride weekend for hanging out and pleasure. And what ways each character deals with through the three day event! The character development moves smoothly and precise for all. There are moments that are hilarious, angry, sad, as well as exciting which move this movie's plot along nicely. The acting is mediocre to entertaining; there are scenes from time to time that do bring a sincere chemistry between the friends (the actors and actresses). The dialogue, a few times, were awkward like the serious moment of the friends finding out about another during a game; something else should have been expressed by a particular character.

Overall, the movie is definitely a plus to how Brown skin/Black LGB and T movie characters provide a more genuine approach to the same cliche story even with them having the stereotypical personas. The authenticity of how the characters react to wants and desires brings a sense that the viewer can relate.

My rating is out of ten stars, I give 8.

I have just learned now that Anthony Burrell is a professional lyrical dancer which he was on television talent show So You Think You Can Dance some years ago. He is a gorgeous dancer!",1430870400,,1398,4.841004184100418
5381312,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"This movies is awesome, its full of love and some cuties. I think it shares love on so many different levels. You see how love hurts sometimes but the best love of all is the love of your true friends. I loved it",1430697600,,212,3.953488372093023

I love the entire cast especially Jussie Smollet with his fine-self, and thanks to him staring in Empire as Jamal re-jogged my memory of this movie. Too bad it was never a sequel or even a TV series. #HotGays #HotLesbians #NiceBooties #EveryGayOrBiGuyMustHaveInHisCollection",1423180800,,427,5.028169014084507

It was obvious that the woman wasn't a lesbo in real life, I just don't get why she was in the movie. The side story about HIV was unrealistic- I'll just leave it at that. The porn star cameos and the Kyle character were my favorite moments in the movie.",1401235200,,418,4.2375

5381350,3,B00A3MBSPQ,"I thought that Jussie did a great job portraying his character.  He is very engaging. However, much of the movie included unnecessarily graphic gay sex encounters. Although simulated--I felt several of these scenes detracted from the overall story of the journey.  I don't know much about gay life, so maybe the scenes actually were necessary.  I just did not understand their importance (other than the scene where the young, virginal gay guy is given GHB and date raped). That seemed to be central to the message about this guys' naivete and the unreliable character of his ""friend""/romantic interest who was supposed to keep an eye on him.",1399334400,,642,4.981308411214953

5381371,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"Excellent acting, direction, and message.  Sort of a documentary and teaching story about how complicated it can be when we are unable to be transparent, vulnerable and honest.  It illustrates a Medical School graduate student growing more mature, taking risks, discovering secrets, and processing them with friends.  Look beneath the surface to find the truth and discover your values.  This is a great introduction to life after college.  Great way to expose character in a few days time.

The acting could be better, the story could be tighter, but it was an interesting take on gay life in black society.  Not as enjoyable as the 'Noah's Arc' series and movie, but I like the approach.",1377043200,,473,4.607142857142857

All of the characters weren't developed at all, they were all flat, one dimensional. Especially the girl, the girl needed to be completely scratched out.

5381386,4,B00A3MBSPQ,"The movie was good overall. There wasn't a true plot line as to where the characters were going or trying to accomplish out of life other than getting laid . They played into the stereo type of being gay men being promiscuous, but counteracted that by having the main character being and advocate for safe sex and getting tested. The cast all were very attractive and funny. Seen several well known Internet bloggers and YouTubers in the movie as well which was a nice touch. The movie ended with the feeling of a part 2 followed up in ATL. That would be great to see. Overall great movie once again especially if you stream it for the great price point.",1369526400,,654,4.458333333333333

I appreciated that all the characters were protrayed as being smart and educated.  I think America to often has seen black youngsters as drug peddlers and pimps, or shadowey characters.  Magnus' online hookup reminds me of my first two attempts at finding love in a chat room.  You talk about deceit.  Both attempts were as disappointing, but ended quicker than Magnus'.  I have, for a long time flet that friendships lead to genuine love, and that's somthing that these five character had.  This is a really good movie.  Buy it!",1369180800,,631,4.822429906542056
5381390,4,B00A3MBSPQ,"Plot is easy to understand, and characters are believable.  Theme is recognizable.
The best part of the film, I believe is that there is so much learned from this movie.  In some ways, the movie is a documentary on gay lifestyles.
The movie shows that no matter what your lifestyle is a person desereves to get respect.  A person has got to be responsible for his part of his life.
There is a lot of pain in this movie, and some of the painful issues are resolved in part.",1368489600,,472,4.280898876404494

5381393,4,B00A3MBSPQ,The SkinNY was a great.  Full of drama and comic relief.  Patrick Ian Polk created a new set of  characters.  Youthful but full of literary promise.  Also there were a few familiar faces from Noah's Arc.

If I must compare I liked everything about Finding Me and Finding Me Truth even though the downside was that the characters seemed more stereotypical.

There were more stereotypical characters in Finding Me and Finding Me Truth.

The Skinny has more appealing characters than Finding Me but Finding me is more entertaining.

Anyway, I give The Skinny 4 stars............

I give Finding me 5 stars...........

5381402,3,B00A3MBSPQ,"A story with ""NY gay pride"" in the background. 4 friends (3 gays and 1 lesbian) are coming to pay a short visit to their friend in Big Apple. So, what do we have here: a gay-virgin who is head over heels in love with his friend, who at the same time is more into drugs and sex than into deeper feelings. A born-with-a-silver-spoon-in-his-mouth boy, who dates another sex addicted cheater. And two willy-nilly characters - a lesbian (portrayed by actress, who couldn't be more straight...) and a typical drama-queen (a gay-rom without one wouldn't make any sense, would it???).
In general the plot is not too complicated. The cover may suggest a lot of hot scenes. Well, there are some naked bodies and some action, but cut to a few seconds.
As I mentioned in the title, it's a flick you can watch during a lazy afternoon. But I wouldn't spend cash on the dvd.",1363996800,2,859,4.512820512820513

5381404,3,B00A3MBSPQ,I thought the movie was okay. I am tired of seeing  this population not being fulfilled within themselves. Constantly seeking outward  validation then looking within. This was a typical gay movie with characters who had no direction and finding the love of their life is everything. Don't get me wrong love is great when you find your soul mate. I would like to think that the person in the mirror is really all you need besides Jesus Christ.,1363392000,,442,4.653846153846154

5381414,3,B00A3MBSPQ,"I enjoyed this movie for the most part.  But, from reading the reviews, I think my expectations were too high and they weren't completely met.  Not to take anything away from the movie though.  The character portrayals are spot on and you can easily this group of friends being ""real"". and encountering these ""real-life"" instances.  I think Anthony did extremely well and Jussie Smollett will go far.",1359676800,,400,4.925373134328358
5381415,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"Five African-American close friends from college, four gay and one lesbian, reunite in New York City for Gay Pride Weekend.  Staying with their friend Magnus (former child actor Jussie Smollett), who is five months into a new relationship himself, the friends discuss their relationship woes, and are there to offer comfort when several go very bad during the course of their visit.  Joey and Langston challenge each other to be the first to find the confidence to approach seemingly unreachable partners at a club.  Sebastian plans a special evening with his crush, Kyle, which goes horribly wrong when they both engage in club drugs, one of several serious issues the film takes on, in a non-preachy, realistic style.  Wilson Cruz and Darryl Stephens have a cameo as medical professionals.

Writer/director/editor Patrik-Ian Polk (""Noah's Arc"") does a commendable job on a well-made, sharp film that is likely relatable to most gay men.  He won a special award at the 2012 Outfest, where this feature had its premiere. This ""Director's Cut"" is unrated, but would be a heavy R for simulated sex and sexual situations, but a reasonable accompanyment to the story.  I enjoyed ""The Skinny"" a great deal, and give it five full stars out of five.",1359244800,,1242,5.0
5381416,3,B00A3MBSPQ,"The film of course is good, but it lack the real true about gay man. I hate watch movie the always put gay down in a bad way.

5381417,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"What was most enjoyable about this movie was the fact that it was honest and really depicted life for the typical African-American gay male of today.  Although Noah's Arc broke barriers, it always lacked that sense of depth and identification that its general core audience expected, and to some aspects, seemed very dated.  The Skinny is young and fresh, and Patrick-Ian Polk nails capturing that essence in this tale of 5 friends' romp in New York City during Pride.  The writing is very smart, the dialogue at times marring the lines between witty and emotional; the acting was on point, which made its translation seamless.  The characters, though stereotypical of these types of films, were not over-exaggerated to the point that they became more like caricatures and less like real people, something I felt his previous projects were guilty of.  We've all encountered the hopeless romantic (Magnus), the selfish playboy who knows he can get anything he wants (Kyle), the naive and susceptible youngin (Sebastian), or insecure and self-absorbed perfectionist (Langston and Joey) at some point in our life, and being gay makes these qualities no less easier to abandon.  There's not much bad to say about this movie.  Informative, not a whole bunch of skin to the point it bordered soft-core porn, and just overall a joy to watch.  I only hope Polk continues to use this format as a platform for his next project.  A must see.",1359158400,3,1430,4.949790794979079

Seeing this film turn from a fun pride weekend romp to profiling drug abuse, date rape, and a PSA on STD/HIV statistics in the black community while ending so improbably upbeat is baffling to me. I assume the setup is for another film to follow the stories started in this film, because I'll be that much more disappointed if there's not going to be sequel to this film. Hopefully next time there's more story and less PSA.",1356307200,,571,4.607843137254902

Patrick Ian Polk is a  great storyteller and a gift to cinema. Not just LGBT or Af-AM cinema. Cinema overall.

It showed Ivy-League-educated African-American characters who were (mostly) members of the upper class in a positive portrayal, with minimal annoying stereotypes. While race and ethnicity were acknowledged, as they should be, race and ethnicity do not drive the story.  Fantastic!  The acting performances were strong, except for the actor who played ""Ryan.""  The entire cast is unbelievably beautiful, and the lovely Ms. Warren-Markland came across as someone I'd love to have martinis with, while dishing celebrity gossip.",1352592000,,559,5.698795180722891
5381429,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"The movie is quite great; and Patrik-Ian Polk always does an excellent job in characterizing the issue surrounding black gay culture. The acting is manifested as people living in a real life situation, and the viewers are easily drawn into the plot and characters lives in a cerebral, virtual reality kind of way. What makes this movie so poignant is that it deals with real struggles that parallel the gay and straight lives on a day to day basis. The fantasy is so miniscule in the movie, until you really don't notice any element of fiction. I only wish that I could have been a real performer in the movie - the casts seem to have had fun as it turned out to be a real hoot. Nevertheless, I know that they had to work their butts off, in order to pull off something that was quite seamless; so serious; and so essential at this time in America, during these elections times; it is simply another academic medium to educate people regarding the need for gay marriages, gay rights, and illustrate the daily and consistent struggles that gays deal with, which are often the same for straight people; perhaps many people will decide that this kind of message will be impertinent or irrelevant to them, as so many people are dead set on hating people without reason; and feel that it is appropriate to insinuate themselves into gay bedrooms; nevertheless, would have the confetti falling and the band playing to get their points across that their bedrooms as heterosexuals are ""off limits.""  I found it challenging to view the rape scene however, and found myself fast forwarding the segment involving the date rape, and the insidious drug inducement given to the character ""Sebastian"" as I replay the movie again and again. I suppose that I am a little nelly in some ways, and really have enough tragedies in my real life, and simply would prefer the fantasy of a perfect world, as I viewed this movie. Nevertheless, I know that it is essential and that it happens in both gay and straight cultures. With this movie, I felt that just for a little while, I wasn't alone; that my (five) friends were with me and loved me also. Very good acting and movie, indeed!",1351209600,11,2160,4.625

5381433,4,B00A3MBSPQ,"I will always support alternative film.  I enjoyed ""The Skinny"" enough to buy it. Loved the actors. Thought it was a bit over the top at first glance, but became a big fan of the group. Good story, good acting for the most part. Just a great production.",1348790400,,253,4.270833333333333
5381434,3,B00A3MBSPQ,This is another look into the Black Gay community.  An interesting video on Gay pride and what it means to be gay in America.  I found it held my attention until the end and it left you with a good fuzzie feeling.,1348185600,,213,4.0476190476190474
5381435,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"This was the BEST black gay movie I have seen and I have watched many. They must come out with a part 2. I thought the Noah's Ark collection was great this is even better. The storyline was real the characters I could relate to just a phenomenal movie. I hate gay movies that end in tragedy its like Hollywood or the powers that be ""Christian"" like people or even gay people have this idea that we are not supposed to be happy so they write these dramatic endings with the main character is alone. This movie was the exception. It hit close to home and still allowed the ending to be open to what the future might bring. I don't want to spoil it for others as some of the other reviews have done but I can say that this is one worth seeing again and again.",1347840000,2,756,4.114864864864865
5381436,2,B00A3MBSPQ,"I'd really enjoyed the series and movie, Noah's Arc, so I looked forward to seeing the director's next project.  But the Skinny is a weak movie.  Too many of the conversations revolve around sexual matters, as if young gay people have nothing else to discuss.  The plot is generally not creative and does not explore some of the potential issues it raises.  This should really have been several films: 1) an education film to inform young people about the importance of safe sex, of staying off drugs, of taking care of each other and practicing good hygiene; 2) a reunion pic about people who stay friends although they have moved on in various ways; 3) an examination of the class conflict and questions of promiscuity and fidelity in Black Gay Culture; 4)a rom-com about two friends who rarely get laid.  Good idea to call it ""The Skinny"" because it's a mighty thin movie.",1347753600,9,875,4.69281045751634
5381437,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"This movie is outstanding,  I recommend every Gay person to see this wonderfully
done story. It will make you laugh as wellas cry. I'm sure many of us can relate to one or more characters in this beautifully made movie.",1346889600,,219,4.475
5381438,3,B00A3MBSPQ,It was a good movie. Certain parts were a little over the top and the acting was not all that good..... But for the most part it was good.... sexy characters,1346889600,,157,4.096774193548387
5381439,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"Just finished watching this on LOGO.  I was blown away because I have never seen a gay film, let alone a black gay film, this well written and acted.  How refreshing it is to watch a black gay movie that's not filled with sterotypical effeminate characters, drag queens and a $1500 budget.  Great writing, great acting, great production values and gorgeous actors make this film a must see for everyone. Creator Patrick Ian-Polk has come a long way since his first film ""Punks"". Cant wait to get this on DVD.  I need to add it to my film collection ASAP!",1346544000,,554,4.51
5381440,5,B00A3MBSPQ,I DO NOT WRITE MANY REVIEWS BECAUSE MY TIME IS LIMITED BUT I COULD NOT LET THIS GO UN-RATED.  THIS MOVIE WAS A PLEASURE TO WATCH.  THE ACTORS WERE CONNECTED TO THE CHARACTERS AND THE CHARACTERS TO REAL LIFE.  THE MOVIE IS ROOTED IN REALITY AND PROVIDES A REFRESHING AND REAL LOOK AT LIFE.  PATRICK  HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB AGAIN AT BRINGING US REALITY.  HE MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE KNOWN HIM ALL HIS DAYS ON THIS EARTH BY CREATING THESE MASTERPIECES.  THANK YOU!,1345939200,,470,4.395348837209302

8546498,2,B00A3MBSPQ,"I wanted to LOVE this movie, I truly did. I loved Noahs Arc and Jumping the Broom but this was very disappointing. It wasn't the writing at all. The storyline was quite good. It was the acting. There was no chemistry between any of the actors and it felt awkward, strained and forced. It was kind of painful to watch. These are supposed to be experienced actors but they didn't look that way. I couldn't FEEL the storyline or passion in any of them. As the sole lesbian of he group, I felt Langstons storyline couldve been expanded. As it was, her character was just an extra. She served no purpose and that was unfortunate because I felt that the movie wouldve made it a lot better by expanding her storyline. It definitely wouldve added more to movie so as not to just make it an the all gay male storyline.  I liked how that he recycled the actors from Noahs Arc. They were the ones who actually saves the movie, in my opinion. With so few movie that feature LGBTQ PoC, I was excited to see this. I was so disappointed that it wasn't as great as it could be. But on the upside, the music was nice and I really wished they couldve had a soundtrack to accompany it.",1525305600,,1166,4.276018099547511
8546499,5,B00A3MBSPQ,"This is a most remarkable film that rotates around the NYC Gay Pride activities with a group of  four young men and one woman.  The interactions of these people is literally a window into a sub-culture within a culture.  It is an insight that is sadly to far lacking in other films.  Some people might call this a cultural phenomena, but what it is, is an education in its own right!  The diversity of life is truly amazing in its ability the present this wonderful example!!

8546506,4,B00A3MBSPQ,"Although a dramedy about people and issues within the gay community, the film transcended its script having non lecturing scenes and dialogue about HIV, Stds, safe sex, abstinence, promiscuity etc, throughout the enjoyable movie",1473552000,,228,5.735294117647059
