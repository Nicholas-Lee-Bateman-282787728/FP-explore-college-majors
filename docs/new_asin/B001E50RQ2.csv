8296336,4,B001E50RQ2,"I probably enjoy this for a reason different from most - Buckley is so smug, self-satisfied, shallow, and wrong, it's fun watching him get picked to shreds and not even realize it",1433203200,,179,4.625
8296337,4,B001E50RQ2,"This is a very personal four stars. For me, these old Firing Line shows are a video time-capsule. I never agreed much with Mr. Buckley, but seeing some of these brings back nice memories of ""the day"", and especially watching them with my brother, who was much more in step with ""Bill"" than I. Also, it must be mentioned that the guests and the conversations are of a calibre that we just don't see anymore on television (or for that matter, hear on radio).",1425945600,3,456,4.440476190476191
8296338,5,B001E50RQ2,"Truly wonderful to watch great minds debate with out the screeching hysteria of today's political shows. Fun to watch the give and take and the subtle and not so subtle insults. It is like watching a heavy weight championship bout. Buckley from the get go attacks and insults Susskind and throughout tries to get Susskind on the ropes, but Susskind takes the punches holds his own and punches back. At the end it was a TKO victory for Susskind, but you have to admire Buckley's wit. Again really fun to watch. Miss the intelligence of these two men.",1370217600,2,549,4.612244897959184
8296339,5,B001E50RQ2,"This is a 1960's episode of Firing Line which deals with (as the title suggests) the prevailing leftist bias in media coverage. Buckley has the facts on his side after the treatment of Barry Goldwater in the '64 campaign and the immediate accusations by some in the media who felt that JFK must've ben shot by a member of the John Burke society (and not a member of the US Communist Party).

Susskind tries to dance around these arguments by attacking Buckley himself. He makes fun of his failed attempt to become the Mayor of New York City. He claims his attacks arer unwarranted and that he has a ""fetish"" regarding the subject at all. I believe this is also the start of the backhanded compliment many (in the media) still give to WFBjr and that he is the ""Pied Piper"" of the Conservative movement. By definition, a Pied Piper draws in his followers by making unrealistic promises. Buckley quickly dismisses this crass compliment and the fact that it was repeated almost ina group think manner when he passed away proves the prevailing bias in the media still exists.

In MANY ways, you can draw comparisons to the present with the events mentioned in the past. Today, much like the figures who claimed the JFK must've been shot by a John Birch right wing extremist in the past, attempt to link any type of mass shooting to either a former member of the military or a tea partier.(ABC's Good Morning America's George Stephanopolous interviewed Brian Ross who attempted this with the Colorado theater Dark Knight massacre).

As for the claim of being a Pied Piper of a movement, please see the Affordable Care Act, who and what was promised and what will happen when the law is fully implemented in 2014.

These shows remain important simply because the criticisms WFBjr raises remain valid and these shows will open your eyes to these same issues happening today.",1363824000,5,1866,4.714723926380368
8296340,5,B001E50RQ2,"A must see! A very intresting dance of word and debate. If Buckley Jr.thought it was bad then he should see it now. Fed Govt on  steriods, states going bankrupt(libral state since this time,like Detroit have failed under purely there watch) .A middle class economy hanging on by a thread,penalties on business who hire too many employees an astronomical debt....but luckly just the other day Obama said,after over 4 years in office and 4 years of librial control of house and senate,and passing the largest tax bill in the history of the free world.....drum-roll.....""we need to grow the economy"".Oh he's a sharp one. I see,tear down the good free market economy and replace it with his leftist Govt one. I should have gone to Columbia University so I could understand how prosperity is bad for free people and how truths don't matter if nobody can hear it. Oh I'd be such the smarty pants:)",1363392000,3,891,4.785714285714286
8296341,5,B001E50RQ2,"It is absolutely astounding to hear the intellectual giants of nearly five decades ago grappling with the same issues of prevailing liberal media bias as we hear today espoused by considerably less elegant, less intellectually nimble, and less linguistically gifted personalities. Likewise, it is unsettling to a greater extent to witness the completely opaque, obtuse, and altogether self-deluded defense of what is undeniably an unsystematic but wholly pervasive liberal indoctrination of intellectual and popular cultures via the academic and media communities, respectively.",1360886400,3,578,6.060975609756097
