8205004,5,B000SAAPLQ,"This is a cool trip down memory lane. I did not grow up with this movie like so many others, but I've grown to love it over the last decade or so.  Seeing everyone around is awesome.  The audio in the convention isn't the best and you need to crank it up at some times, but it's some great stories from great actors.  I really wish the guy who played Judas were alive to see how wonderfully loved his movie became!",1471910400,2,414,4.08641975308642

8205008,4,B000SAAPLQ,"What a hoot to see the cast of the movie version of Jesus Christ Superstar back together again after all these years.  It's not easy to recognize some of them at first but once you do the memories come flooding back.  There is virtually no music from the movie featured but I suspect, since the documentary was made on the cheap, that they couldn't afford it.  But it doesn't matter.  Ted Neeley, Yvonne Elliman and Barry Dennen still rock forty years after they shot the movie.  If you're a huge J.C. Superstar geek like me then you'll love it.",1453680000,3,545,4.4646464646464645

8205010,5,B000SAAPLQ,"A must have for every Jesus Christ Superstar fan. While it's not the longest documentary, it's chock full of interesting information and footage about the making of this amazing groundbreaking film. I am so glad that Ted Neeley produced this DVD, it is obviously a labor of love from the man who knows this film better than anyone else. He has been involved in every aspect of the movie and the many stage productions for over 40 years and is still thrilling people everywhere with his amazing pipes and genuine love for his fans. Not to mention.... what a hottie ...every single girl I knew (myself included) in 1973 had the biggest crush on Ted Neeley!!  Rock on Ted, thanks so much for this gift ... your fans all over the world love you!",1452211200,4,741,4.529850746268656

RIC FLAIR & THE FOUR HORSEMEN
Before the nWo, DX, and Evolution...there was the Four Horsemen. This was the elite stable/faction in wrestling that dominated the late 1980's in the NWA to the point where they're influence on wrestling is still being felt to this day & will be felt on throughout professional wrestling. You get comments from throughout the presentation from previous Horsemen such as Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, James J. Dillion, Barry Windham, Paul Roma, and Chris Benoit along with other personalities such as Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Ricky Steamboat, Michael Hayes, Jim Ross, Teddy Long, Eric Bischoff, Dusty Rhodes, Paul Ellering, Kendall Windham, and Steve Austin.

The aftermath of Arn & Tully leaving, the NWA being bought by Ted Turner, and the placement of Jim Herd in WCW's management is discussed along with the story behind Kendall Windham's association with the Horsemen with comments from Kendall himself. Hiro Matsuda replacing J.J. Dillion and how that made things even worse for the current state of the Horsemen is discussed along with the story behind Arn Anderson returning WITHOUT Tully Blanchard & Barry Windham himself leaving. The true story behind Sting becoming a Horsemen and his rivalry with Ric Flair is heavily discussed including the infamous ""Black Scorpion"" angle that Flair himself even admit was embarrassing. The story behind Sid Vicious being put into the group to the heavy disapproval of Ric Flair is brought up before Flair discusses how he left WCW (which was heavily censored), why his WWE run didn't live up to expectations, and his return back to WCW. This is one of the most interesting parts of this DVD as they talk about Paul Roma joining the Horsemen with Roma himself talking about what he brought more to the table that ""Pillsbury dough boy"" Anderson & ""98 year old"" Flair couldn't. The hotel incident involving Sid Vicious stabbing Arn Anderson with scissors and how that led to the Roma version of the Horsemen ending.

THE AMERICAN DREAM: THE DUSTY RHODES STORY
""The American Dream"" Dusty Rhodes is a legend in this business. Dusty Rhodes was one of the men back in the early stages of wrestling (late 70's/early 80's) who was able to have a crossover appeal with fans that rarely anybody could touch. He transcended racial barriers & was accepted by all because the fans could legitly feel like he was one of them. You can call him ""The Common Man"" or even ""Mr. Soul"" but he was truly The American Dream.

His first run in the WWF was based about his feud with ""Superstar"" Billy Graham and his three matches in MSG with Graham are discussed. Dusty becoming the NWA Champion, his heavy road schedule, and his unbelievable promos & catchphrases are talked about leading up to his feud with Ric Flair leading up to their famous Great American Bash cage match in which Dusty won the title. Dusty's reign as booker in WCW and how he gets a bad rap for some of the things he's done (the Robocop angle, the ""Dusty Finish"" full of run-in's & false finishes) along with some of the positives (Ron Simmons becoming the first African American World Champion & his ideas for PPV's such as Great American Bash, Starrcade, and Halloween Havoc) are profiled along with how it ended up coming to an end. Dusty's entrance in to the WWE as ""The Common Man"" is heavily discussed from all the promos ranging from the pizza man to the gas man to the meat man, his manager Sapphire, and his ""polka dots."" The storyline involving Ted Dibiase & how that led to Dustin Rhodes coming into the WWE & teaming with Dusty is a big story in this documentary as they also talk about their separation & eventual reunion along with the story of how Dustin had to become Goldust to escape his father's shadow before talking about what's Dusty doing now rounds out this presentation.

BRIAN PILLMAN: LOOSE CANNON
Brian Pillman is a forgotten name in the history of wrestling which is a shame considering how innovative he was in & outside the ring. It didn't matter if it was Flyin' Brian, the Hollywood Blonde, the Horsemen or even the Loose Cannon...Pillman was a innovator & always fighting against the odds.

The DVD stars talking about Brian's growing up including throat problems when he was really young to his football career & overcoming the ""he's too small"" stereotype that some get when it comes to playing football. His days in Calgary Stampede Wrestling are covered such as his tag team with Bruce Hart called Bad Company before moving on to WCW as Flyin' Brian. The way Brian brought a unique style & was able to stand out above the others despite his size and his ability to make others like Lex Luger look better than he was in the ring...the only downside to this was that they didn't bring up the Yellow Dog angle since that was his first real storyline within the company. The importance to the Light Heavyweight Title and how Brian fought to make that title really valuable to the company is brought up along with the importance of his marriage (including footage from the actual wedding video) is also talked about. The DVD really kicks into high gear here as his run in the tag team of the Hollywood Blondes with ""Stunning"" Steve Austin is heavily talked about. The story of how they were just thrown together by Dusty Rhodes (who finally comments about the whole situation) and started to get over, developing a team concept & look even down to their wrestling boots (you have to see that one to believe it), having the top feuds with people like Ric Flair & Anderson along with Steamboat & Douglas, and the backstage politics that led to the breakup of the team. Pillman joining the Horsemen is glossed upon before you see how he transformed himself into the Loose Cannon character including the two most memorable incidents involving him catching Bobby Heenan off guard & dropping the ""F"" bomb on live TV and the strap match between him & Kevin Sullivan resulting in the ""bookerman"" line. His short time in ECW is talked about & shown through highlights (the whole footage is too vulgar for WWE) including the story of how he got released from WCW and Joey Styles talking about an incident that happened which made lose all respect for Pillman. The infamous life changing car accident is talked about next along with his arrival to the WWE. The whole story behind the buildup & the actual incident involving Pillman pulling a gun on Austin is heavily talked about including comments from those who worked for WCW at the time & what they thought about it. Pillman's run in the Hart Foundation is talked about along with the reasoning behind his short stint of being an announcer is talked about along with what was going on behind the scenes with him continuing to work & hide the pain from his heavily injured ankle from the accident. Pillman's last angle involving Goldust & Marlena and the real story between those three about along with the ""XXX Files"" promos are discussed before leading into the story behind his death & the interview with his wife the next night on RAW close this documentary out.

Matches include a Stampede Wrestling match as a member of Bad Company against Midnight Cowboys, WCW United States Champion Lex Luger (Halloween Havoc '89), the finals of the WCW United States Tag Team Championship tournament with Z-Man vs. Fabulous Freebirds, a War Games Match teaming with Sting & Steiner Brothers vs. Ric Flair & Sid Vicious & Barry Windham & Larry Zbyszko (Wrestle War '91), a ""Loser Leaves Town"" match with El Gigante vs. Arn Anderson & Barry Windham (Clash Of The Champions XV), the finals of the WCW Light Heavyweight Championship tournament against Richard Morton (Halloween Havoc '91), two matches against Jushin Liger including a Light Heavyweight Championship Match (SuperBrawl II) & the first match on ""WCW Monday Nitro"", with Barry Windham vs. Z-Man & Johnny Gunn, a Tag Team Championship Steel Cage Match with Steve Austin vs. Dos Hombres (Slamboree '93), a Thundercage Match with Sting & Dustin Rhodes vs. Rick Rude & Barry Windham & Paul Orndorff, Dean Malenko (""Nitro"" Jan. '96), Eddie Guerrero that's remembered for the incident with Bobby Heenan (Clash Of The Champions XXXII), Steve Austin (""RAW"" June '97), the 10 man tag teaming with Hart Foundation vs. Steve Austin & Ken Shamrock & Goldust & Legion Of Doom (""IYH: Canadian Stampede"" July '97), and his final PPV match against Goldust where he would either leave WWE or win Marlena for 30 days (""IYH: Ground Zeo"" Sept. '97)

Other DVD extras include interview outtakes from such people as Road Warrior Animal, Mick Foley talking about his first match with Pillman, Stone Cold talking about their first meeting & how Brian should be remembered, Eric Bischoff & Jim Ross commenting on an incidents in which Pillman lived his character with J.R. also telling a story about a funny ""meeting"" he had in a bathroom with Brian. Also included is the entire gun incident involving Pillman & Austin, the ""XXX Files"" promos involving Pillman & Marlena, a WCW interview with Brian from '95, and the Flare For The Old skit with him & Steve Austin.

THE MONDAY NIGHT WAR
This is basically the story behind the feud between WWE & WCW and but if your looking for a fair view of WCW, then it's not gonna happen here. WWE leaves out details to make WCW look worse than it actually was (they mentioned Mike Tyson at WrestleMania but didn't mention Dennis Rodman at Bash At The Beach for example) and include comments by people like Gerald Brisco that were just completely unnecessary (he comes off like he's kissing Mr. McMahon's ass non-stop) while Eric Bischoff is the only one who doesn't bury WCW throughout the whole documentary. The documentary covers from all the way back to the early days of both federations, the start of Nitro and all the dirty tricks played (giving away RAW results, Billionaire Ted skits, WWE stars showing up on Nitro only weeks after being on WWE TV), the rise of Mr. McMahon & Stone Cold & The Rock & Triple H, the innovation of the luchadors & ""real"" wrestlers into WCW, the backstage problems between Bischoff & Ric Flair, younger stars leaving WCW for WWE because they were held down by veterans & politics, Russo's time in WCW, and everything up to the final Nitro.

Matches include Tag Team Champions Owen Hart & British Bulldog vs. Steve Austin & Shawn Michaels (""RAW"" May '97), Legion Of Doom vs. Shawn Michaels & Triple H (""RAW"" Dec. '97), Chris Benoit vs. Booker T (""Nitro"" June '98), and WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Goldberg (""Nitro"" July '98).  Other DVD extras featured infamous RAW & Nitro moments such as when Stone Cold stunned McMahon for the first time, Jim Cornette's controversial comments about ""icons in wrestling"", the ""Bret Screwed Bret"" interview with Jim Ross & Vince McMahon, Eric Bischoff challenging Vince to a fight, Ric Flair's return to WCW in Sept. '98, the story behind Rick Rude's appearance on RAW & Nitro on the same night and two ""Confidential"" stories regarding the last WCW Monday Nitro & when DX invaded WCW Nitro.

The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection was one of the best presentations in regards to a talent focusing on various feuds & chapters through his career, Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen was an excellent profile on without a doubt the most influential group in wrestling history, Dusty Rhodes was a great collection of his career matches & promos, Brian Pillman's set highlighted a lost & forgotten innovator in wrestling, and the only downfall of this set would be the ""Monday Night War"" DVD with WWE telling a heavily ""history is written by the winners"" biased story that was nothing more than a WCW burial & would have been better to put the Road Warriors set on here instead of that.  So you can probably get this collection of WCW superstars individually for a cheaper price but if not then this is a good collection of WWE DVD's with a heavy focus on World Championship Wrestling.",1370304000,,23192,4.824239376414383
