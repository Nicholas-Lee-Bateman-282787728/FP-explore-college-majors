It really helps break up the monotony of indoor training and creates a great environment for focused efforts that I experience when I'm training and racing. Additionally, the sights are spectacular. You almost feel like you're being transported to a different place. The added features of stretching really helps too. This is an A+ must have for cyclist.",1325721600,,406,4.985294117647059
4598215,5,B0058DAZMM,"I have the Hawaii series, the Italy series, and now this one. I didn't think it could get any better, but it has. This DVD series has everything that you want out of a virtual, indoor cycling series. I'm really impressed with the new approach, the story weaving involved in this dvd series, and the two person narrative as one option. The scenery is beautiful and the terrain is brutal. This series has everything. With each Global Ride series, the rides themselves just get better and better. Perfect!",1310083200,4,502,4.715909090909091
8461354,2,B0058DAZMM,I am a fan of the global ride products and find them enjoyable and helpful. The France  rides however was disappointing due to poor editing.  When you are using the tapes you want to be looking forward to see the road ahead so you can perhaps pace yourself or target sprints  or be behind the riders  so you could do the same and even see how they are doing. Occasional glimpses to the left or right for the scenery is fine and enjoyable.  However these tapes constantly have the camera in front of the riders looking backwards at them.  Why? This does not help the user push himself or herself and it is frankly annoying.  Is the goal to give the riders air time?  An occasional glimpses is fine to give perspective but it is done way too much.  It is pointless and amateurish and I do not know why the editor felt it would be appreciated by the users. Just the opposite.  I have bought a number of the sets but frankly I am now reluctant to buy anymore. It's a shame since theyare otherwise very well prepared and photographed cd's.,1502841600,,1034,4.338541666666667

8461356,4,B0058DAZMM,"Got this as a gift for my father who is big into triathlons and has a stationary bike indoors.  He set up a TV in front of his trainer and can play it to imagine he is riding through France!  Good narrative and options, although it would be good if it was all shown through the first person perspective (sometimes they show from the side or front of the pack, which is not really helpful).  Nice that the narrative and music can be turned on or off as desired.",1448323200,,460,4.146067415730337
8461357,5,B0058DAZMM,"If you're going to spin indoors, in my humble opinion, you need something to look at besides a wall.  So why not make it something specific to the training your doing? The folks at Global Ride did a nice job on this video series.  The scenery is spectacular for starters.  But there's more than just pretty mountains on these DVDs.  There are two options for ""coaching"" during the ride. US English or UK.  I chose US first.  I am new to any sort of formal rode bike training, so I learned quite a bit listen to the coaching banter during the rides.  The format was sort of ""fly on the wall"".  You're listening to a coach (actually two coaches) critiquing the ride of some other riders and offering guidance to another rider and to some extent, each other.  All good stuff.  I listen to but did not yet train with the ""UK"" coach. She's a great athlete and her style was more explanatory at least for the one session I watched from the couch.  I just finished an hour with the US guys.  Tonight I plan to do her pace line session to see how it goes.

I'm pretty happy with the DVD set and looking to pick up Global Rides other training DVDs.  It makes the training interesting and informative and I think way more motivational than watching some TV show or some music.  One more thing.  The music.  I turn it off simply because I'm not a fan of elevator or techno stuff. But I learned that they seemed to have chosen the music as a pacing tool.  So, if you can stand the type of tunes, go for it. It may help you maintain the correct pace.",1424649600,2,1537,4.241379310344827
8461358,5,B0058DAZMM,"I received the France series as a gift.  The 3 dvd set is terrific and I highly recommend this set, the music is good and the scenry is nice, you feel like you are riding along with other riders in France.  The ride will take you along parts of the tour de france.  I would purchase some of the other riding series produced by this company.",1364774400,,340,4.121212121212121
8461359,5,B0058DAZMM,"As very contented customer and user of Global Rides cycling video products, I purchased their 3 disk France package eagerly.  I was not disappointed!  It provides 3 disks of an hour each of virtual cycling through France and, as an added feature each disk includes a half hour segment of yoga or complimentary cycling exercises.  Each disk focuses on a different aspect of cycling:  general road cycling, pace lining, and climbing.  The routes follow roads upon which the Tour de France is held.  The overall quality is very good, and similar to their other fine packages.  While I can use each of the DVD's to get a good heart rate going, I can also use them for a decent recovery ride.  While I like to push my indoor trainer workouts to around 90 minutes, these hour long segments work quite well, when a focused hour is what you have to work with.  If I let the DVD roll into the additional feature segment, I can stretch a good workout to 90 minutes easy.  Moreover, the quality of the DVD's and the reliability of Global Rides has always been high end.  They are very supportive and respond to your inquiries.  The France Series is a great value and a great addition to one's virtual cycling and training library.",1361404800,2,1219,4.566820276497696
8461360,5,B0058DAZMM,Excellent DVD - beautiful vistas and feels like you are cycling with the team.  Only negative is that sometimes they video the team from the rear of the camera car - the effect is that you suddenly feel like you are pedaling backwards.  Works much better when they use an offset frame to make the rear facing shots seem like they are being seen in the mirror.  Otherwise this is a huge improvement to my winter workouts - I love to bike watching this video.,1359936000,,457,4.352941176470588
8461361,5,B0058DAZMM,"I have actually purchased all of the Global ride box sets, including the France box set.  I have found each ride to be professionally done including the ride commentary, scenery, and class objectives for the ride.  The commentary gives me some insight to options that I may want to use in my class.  As an instructor, it is helpful to get another perspective on how to present the ride.  My indoor cycling classes look forward to our virtual rides as it helps to make the ride more real as many of our participants ride outdoors as well. I do not use the commentary during the class as I become the coach for the ride.  I am looking forward to the release of Global Rides Spain DVD box set and plan to purchase it as soon as it becomes available.  Global Rides, keep up the good work.",1349136000,,784,4.335616438356165
8461362,5,B0058DAZMM,"The Global ride: France Series is beautifully done. I enjoyed every bit of it. I'm not experienced at cycling. I do this on my exercise equipment to keep me motivated to stay fit. I enjoy having the options of music or not. I can also choose my coach. That makes the DVD more valuable to me because it's never quite the same.

The location of this ride is spectacular!

I've done the rides through Italy, Hawaii, and now France. All have been excellent. This time I would have quit, but none of the others on this ride were quitting, so I stuck with it. Great workout!

I will probably buy the next series when it's ready.",1331251200,3,622,4.344827586206897

This is a breath of fresh alpine air, after a decade of Winter indoor cycle training in front of DVD products following a bunch of sweaty folk on turbo trainers in a gym or random museum locations, with just one coach directing the 'same ole' session. What i most like about all the Global Ride DVD's is the concept of training variation, which leads to rapid improvement in performance, simply by selecting your choice of coach - American, Australian, British, French (!) or riding your own interval session to the great tracks provided! Each coach provide a different training session based on the terrain, ride group, technical elements eg: cadence, HR, speed, power which means you avoid the 'same old' sessions every Winter. As an international triathlete and coach of a competitive team of athletes, 'same ole' training sessions are not the road to travel on for performance gain, improvement or podiums!
The biggest highlight for me is the scenery and setting - how many of us can actually ride a stage of the Tour de France, or a long alpine climb enscribed with famous names, in our living room? Having regular reminders of the stunning scenery throughour every ride provides high levels of motivation and leads to a more quality session outcome.
Overall this box set of 3 x 1 hour rides is suitable for triathletes and cyclists looking to improve their overall cycling performance, threshold training, pedalling efficiency and endurance over the Winter. The bonus segments are a beneficial way to finish your session too!
A great product Global Ride - look forward to seeing the next offering!!
