8386740,5,B00318D79O,"I bought this to view on the plan - 5 hours of cramped, sardine-like confinement.  It really helps.  I downloaded it to my tablet and watched it on my trip from PA to AZ.  The reason I recommend this film is that it is quite cheap (relative to other movies) and very interesting.  It is also ""plotless"" thus you are quite likely to forget everything in six months so you can view it again within the same year.  It absolutely helps the time pass on these cattle-car flights.  Also good in this regard are audiobooks.  Depending on the size of your hard drive in the tablet, you can only fit one or two of these Reader's Digest documentaries - they make a whole bunch.  Once you arrive at your destination, you are likely going to want to remove the movie to free up space.  They REALLY take up a lot of space.  Why, you ask, can't you just stream the movies?  BECAUSE the airlines do not let you do so.  You can purchase internet time aboard the plane but you cannot access anything which requires streaming - which is just about everything you'd want to access, if you purchased internet time aboard the flight.  You cannot stream anything.  Accordingly, you have to buy the movie in order to download it to your devise.  That is why I stress that it is cheap and recyclable.  In comparison to other documentaries, Reader's Digest documentaries are much less expensive and just about as interesting.",1469318400,,1400,4.51792828685259

8386746,5,B00318D79O,"A  wonderful and unique way  to arm-chair-travel to unusual and fascinating corners of the world- not as a tourist but as a HIKER. The series takes you to distant and hard to reach places and helps you see our beautiful planet through the eyes of a hiker. Having retired from hiking at age 80+, I appreciated the opportunity to experience that feeling again. If you have never hiked before, this may inspire you to try it. My only regret is that no further ""Scenic Walks"" seem to have been recorded beyond these first two magnificent DVD's. I keep hoping ... Meanwhile, I can highly recommend this arm chair adventure !",1356220800,3,619,4.618181818181818
