1522561,4,B00005JNRM,"Any movie that handles the molestation of an adolescent girl by the ""uncle"" that is mommy's boyfriend, and does so with respect and depth will earn at least four stars.  T.D. Jakes brings us a woman on death row for killing...who...we don't find out until the end--but she did it at a revival meeting altar.  There is an intelligent and creative use of flashbacks, subject interviews, and straight drama.  I was drawn in by the ""why?"" questions that persisted to the end.  Good suspense!

There is a quality feel to this film that is often lacking in Christian productions.  By concentrating on acting, tempo, dialogue and feel, Woman Thou Art Loosed succeeds, where others seemed to failed by busting their budgets on second-rate special effects, and then skimping on acting.

Bottom-line:  Woman Thou Art Loosed earns a solid for stars for a truly dramatic tale that truly reflects the composite of a dysfunctional society.  Four stars only for the very obvious ""product placement"" of the producer and ministry.  There's is nothing wrong with promoting the gospel and the ministry that backs a movie--Billy Graham has done so for years.  However, such movies lack the subtlety generally required for five star ratings.",1112918400,,1220,5.019900497512438

1522563,5,B00005JNRM,Just finished watching this movie and it was wonderful!!!  Very heartbreaking.  Very much worth the money.,1111881600,2,106,5.5625
1522564,4,B00005JNRM,"Woman Thou Are Loosed is a very compelling drama featuring the amazing Kimberly Elise, who is no doubt the new Angela Bassette of this decade. Her performance here is so powerful that I am rather surprised that she had been overlooked by the Oscar people. Simply put, if you want to compare last year's Oscar winning Charlize Theron's Monster role to another actress, it would have to be Elise. She gets to carry a film on her own for the first time, and it's a very demanding role of a woman abused and raped by her step-fathher, and disbelieved and unloved by her mother. With previous works so impressive such as Beloved and Set It Off, it's the perfect vehicle to let her showcase her most dramatic side.

Elise's character(Michelle) is a true representation of the countless abused and victimized woman, despite the fact that this is a fictional story. She had endured a great deal of physical, emotional, and spiritual damage that her life is shattered terribly. To see her victimizer(Clifton Powell) at the ""Revival"" service ceremony, out of impulse, she had to pull the trigger at the ""monster"". It was mesmerzing to see her screaming and in tears as she shot him dead instantly in front of hundreds of people including her mother(Loretta Devine) whom she blamed and hated for years.

The story is told in  flashback format when Michelle while on death row was visited by a precher(Bishop TD Jakes). I was impressed the way they shot some of the main characters individually speaking about their thoughts and feelings about the story and their character's experiences directly at the camera. For instance, we get a better understanding why Cassey(the mother) was so neglectful and didn't take her daughter seriously. She talked about her own unfortunate childhood experience with abuse and rape from her father, and the mother just told her to get over it. So to her it wasn't a big deal, it was just a life experience to grow through.

This film really dealt with Forgiveness and Redemption, and it's a spiritually impacting journey.",1111363200,,2042,4.859195402298851
1522565,4,B00005JNRM,A powerful film with gritty performances by an excellent cast. Sobering but hopeful story.

1522566,5,B00005JNRM,"Last month I traveled to Bamberg, Germany to visit my sister and the same day I got there her friend wanted to go to the movies because this movie, ""Woman, thou art loosed"" was playing. After a 13 hour flight and  no sleep I thought I would just fall asleep half way through the movie. This film grabs you within the first 10 minutes and doesnt let you go, the story line is very realistic, the acting is superb. I recomend this film to anyone, you will love it!",1110585600,,462,4.191011235955056
1522567,5,B00005JNRM,"WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED is an amazingly successful film. Based on and book and subsequent play by the Dallas Bishop T.D. Jakes (who portrays himself in this film demonstrating quality acting skills), WOMAN is based on a composite of women for whom Jakes has provided counseling in his ministry.  He is committed to the abused women not only of his congregation but now to all abuse women.

Michelle (Kimberly Elise is a staggeringly perfect performance) is introduced to us on Death Row with the Bishop TD Jakes making a visit to minister to her. Through a finely wrought series of flashbacks and onscreen commentary by many of the characters in the story we learn that Michelle was raped by Reggie (Clifton Powell), one of her mother Cassey's (Loretta Divine, another praiseworthy performance) boyfriends, transient and live-in, whom Michelle is required to address as 'Uncle'.  When Michelle tries to tell her mother of the rape, Cassey refuses to believe her, fearing that if she confronts Reggie that he will leave her - a woman at whose age and 'family' status makes keeping a man difficult.

Michelle escapes her home and takes to the streets with her friend Nicole (Idalis DeLeon) and soon finds herself at eh mercy of a drug dealer Pervis (Sean Blakeman) who requires her to be a stripper and prostitute.  She is eventually imprisoned for various reasons and it is with all of this in the past that the movie opens.

Once TD Jakes arranges for Michelle to be out of prison she reconnects with Cassey who is still living with the worthless Reggie, and refuses to take Michelle under her roof.  Michelle finds comfort with Twana (Debbie Morgan) who helps her improve her appearance, sets her up with a fine childhood friend Todd (Michael Boatman) and Michelle attends TD Jakes revivals with the hope of making something  different with her life.  But she is shadowed by her past with Pervis and her loathing for Reggie and ultimately shoots Reggie during one of Jakes' revival meetings.  For this she is arrested, imprisoned, and  sentenced to Death Row.  It is here in her cell that the story begins and ends, but it is the impact of TD Jakes on her spiritual life that makes for a very touching ending that would be unfair to reveal.

This is first rate movie making and Director Michael Schultz has done a splendid job creating the atmosphere of the African American massive revivals, the agony of abused children and women, and the sensitivity of the clergy to those without hope.  This film does not preach: this film speaks softly, as in a prayer.  The actors are sensationally fine and the emotional ride is well worth your investment of time.

1522879,3,B00005JNRM,"I watched this film that I had bought a few years ago.  Honestly, I expected to hate it because I hated Stan Foster's Film ""Preacher's Kid"" which was just released.  I expected this to be more of the same garbage.  I give it 3 stars because due to the language of the movie I know Christians who would not let this movie in their house.  It cursed 5 times.  Possibly 6 times if you count a word that I do not due to the way it was used.  There is also a lot of sexual innuendo, and there is one sex scene which is a little to revealing for a Christian movie.  Also there are quite a few hypocritical Christians in this movie.  With this all said and done though, there is alot of heart ache in this movie which is caused by sins of many different natures.  There is also a realistic repentance from this sin.  All in all, I understand why the directors let this film go in this direction.  Personally, I would have preferred the language to be reigned in a little, and I don't know if T.D. Jakes should have really promoted this film.  However, I do see how it can be labeled a Christian film because the message of Christ is there even though I feel that some do not get the full meaning of what it is to be a Christian.",1272931200,3,1221,4.105485232067511

1522952,3,B00005JNRM,"A gut-wrenching and raw drama, ""Woman, Thou Art Loosed"" is a sobering experience.  This tragic story is told in flashback by a young woman, Michelle Jordan, who's in death row and being counseled by real-life evangelical preacher, Bishop T D Jakes.  As a 12-year-old, Michelle was raped by her mother's live-in boyfriend, Reggie, whom she was obligated to call ""uncle.""  Suffering from the mental and emotional damage, her life spirals downward into drugs and prostitution, landing her in jail.  Paroled after three years, Michelle tries to put her previous life behind her and start fresh--she attends church revival meetings, renews her friendship with Todd, a childhood friend who regards her as his first love, and in an attempt at healing, finally confronts her mother, Cassie, for denying what happened and protecting Reggie all these years.  Just when she's found hope that she could turn her life around, she sees Reggie at a revival, triggering the painful memories and disappointments, and ends it all with violence.

The film is an adaptation of Bishop Jake's book and its title refers to one of his several conferences incorporated within his predominantly African-American ministry.  The conference's emphasis is on social ills, and the guidance and empowerment of abused women.  The film has been described as a commercial for the ministry and a vanity production.  I didn't quite see it that way.  Although it was likely intended for the Christian public, and there were taped scenes of the preacher's revival meetings, I viewed it simply as any other film.  My religion had nothing to do with it and had no bearing on my opinions of its quality.  Though he's in it as Michelle's spiritual counsel, this story is not about Bishop Jakes.  It's about the destruction of a little girl and how she later attempts to pick up the pieces of her broken life.  I thought the film to be generally honest and realistic in its portrayal of the long-term damages suffered by the victim, and commendable in its efforts to provide some measure of hope amidst the wreckage.

The acting was uneven in many scenes--too melodramatic perhaps where a more subdued or nuanced portrayal would have been more effective.  The lead, Kimberly Elise as Michelle, whose beauty reminded me of a younger Cicely Tyson, was ferocious all throughout, but in some instances could have been tempered by more disciplined direction to better effect.  Loretta Devine as Cassie did a terrific job, surprising me since I don't associate her with dramatic roles.  The use of character monologues, where each would periodically intimate to the camera their thoughts and feelings, was an unnecessary and jarring device.  It's far from a perfect film and there's nothing special that would distinguish it; however, I thought it to be altogether a worthwhile and moving story.",1215820800,3,2845,5.0665236051502145

And, although I think the movie suffered from trying to stay too close to the novel &/or the play versions of the story, the strong acting really held the movie together -- especially Kimberly Elise's role (I used to be involved in jail ministry & can vouch for the fact that Elise's performance is VERY realistic).",1165622400,5,696,5.214285714285714
1522961,3,B00005JNRM,"This was an extremely heart wrenching film.  Parts of it were kind of like listening to George W. Bush orate.  They made me so furious I had to turn down the volume.  The mother (played to perfection by the great Loretta Devine) was a CRIMINAL to  allow her baby daughter to be raped and  then not validate or love her.  Mom said she herself also was abused by her father however, her mother validated her experience although she told her it was a woman's burden to bear.  Our rotten  Mom told her baby daughter she was a liar when she found her hiding in a closet bleeding after being raped by her drunken lover.  On top of that, the preacher greatly valued the mother because she was a hard working glamourous member of his church.  She and those of her ilk, are the rock on which he builds his church. I'd love to go to a revival and wear a beautiful hat and clap my hands for God's magic to help me  out of a jam.  How was it the preacher  never cared about the rotteness of the Mom who lived with a nasty man who was married to someone else, who didn't work, and who abused her child with her full knowledge and who did all this because she just couldn't live without a ""man""?  The mother is the criminal; her lover is her tool.  I don't understand Bishop T.J. Jakes. He seems like a collaborator of the Mother's.  He let her do her thing and still be accepted by the church community.",1160611200,4,1390,4.208333333333333

The Church is not going to truly make a difference until she gets her head out of the sand and faces these realities. I applaud Bishop Jakes for keepin' it real and having the courage to address the issue of sexual abuse. I had to confront the issue with my wife's family because my wife was abused by her brother for 9 years. This is a very real problem that needs to be addressed without any sort of buffering to those who are not victims.

1523026,1,B00005JNRM,"My fiancee, Jay, and I were VERY DISAPPOINTED and VERY GRIEVED in our spirits that this ""Christian Film"" would stoop to the world's low level of film making.  We wasted our money buying this DVD.  This movie went too far with the profanity, sexual content, and drug scenes.  This is not a movie for born-again (esp. Spirit-Filled) believers to see.  Believers will be extremely offended by the worldly content in this movie.  It's not a good witness to the lost that a ""Christian Film"" would go this far. It's hypocritical!

We understand that this movie is for a mature audience because it deals with serious issues such as child molestation, rape, incarceration, and forgiveness.  This is no excuse for the profanity and showing the main character's flashback of getting raped by the drug dealer.  The movie is good at showing how messed up some people in the world are but went too far making things realistic.  This movie left out the name of Jesus and didn't glorify God like other Christian films.

The movie would've been good if the profanity and the drug dealer rape was removed from the movie.  Also, it would've been good if the name of Jesus would've been mentioned and more focus given to repentance.

We're extremely disappointed that T.D. Jakes(he's one of our favorite preachers), one of the most anointed preachers  in the world, would produce a film like this.  I went to TD's Megafest 2004 (the most powerful mtgs. ever) and have all of the DVDs.  MegaFest 2004 are the most powerful DVD's we've ever seen and this movie is the worst DVD we've ever seen.",1138060800,12,1573,4.731617647058823

The story was sadly so realistic. I think this movie has been a long time coming, meaning it speaks on subject matter that the african america community is sometimes very hesitant to address.  The effects of such circumstances can really place the indivual on a firey path of self-distance and set them up for failure.  Self-distance may not be present in the dictionary but it is very present in the hearts, minds, and souls of anyone who experiences this films trials in their own life. Once you become accustom to distancing your self from your 'self' meaning hiding your pain, your fears, your emotions, pretending to be ok when you're hurting inside... you create this distance inside of yourself that becomes miles and miles wide within the body. You build up this wall of protection that is so very difficult to break down.  And God forbid the time comes to break it down and you've had it up for so long, that you just can't... and then u miss out, u end up doing the same thing to yourself that your abusers did...

It really stirred me up, knowing that this happens in real life, that little girls are raped and molested, and their mothers don't protect them.  Makes your blood boil.  I loved the vinettes each of the characters gave, which helped me get the story from their perspective. So, when the mother gave hers, I felt so much emotion of disgust.  Yet, she reasoned it like this:  ""I didn't deny it all for either of them, but for me.  It was a selfish thing, cause I don't want to be alone.""  That's still really rotton, but the truth.

The acting was superb. Kimberly Elise is awesome as always. She is one of the best talents in Hollywood.

Clifton Powell played a villian who was terrifying.

And Loretta Devine, made me believe and even feel sorry for the mother as wrong as I thought she was.

However I feel this movie focused too much on Bishop Jakes and his ministry. There were too many scenes of him preaching and his choir singing.

Especially considering none of it had a positive affect on the outcome of the story.",1122940800,8,598,4.4
1523092,3,B00005JNRM,"There are some real strengths to this movie. First and foremost is Kimberly Elise. She's a very talented and versatile actress, and in this one she plays a damaged convict very well. She's not overly showy with it, not loud and over the top, as some actresses might have been. She just manages to carry within her a hard rock at her heart. Even her body language and subtle facial expressions convey a mixture of danger, longing, humor. Really well done, and quite a departure as Kimberly Elise herself is nothing like the character she's playing. That's real acting.

I was skeptical about how I'd feel about Bishop Jakes. This is obviously a full length commericial for him and his ministry. The only thing is he's really quite good. He's a powerful presence on the pulpit and a strong, deep-voiced, wise character in the quieter scenes. So, I know it's a commercial, but why not let him play himself? I don't know who could have done the job better.

On the other hand, I'm not that big a fan of Loretta Devine in this. She just plays her role too surface, with rolling eyes and an almost swooning cliche. And this sort of leads into what I didn't enjoy as much about this. In some ways it rehashes old material. African-American literature (and the films based on it) are full of stories of sexually abused women - see Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, etc. This material was potent when it first came out and gave voice to otherwise voiceless people, but for me at this point it felt a bit dated to have yet another abused African-American child story. This is not to say that it doesn't still happen and that this film will speak to people who haven't read those books, but this viewer wanted a fresher take on it all, some way to take the core material and move it in a different direction. This film goes part way and there are some great performances, but it more fits into a mold than breaks it.",1122336000,6,1914,4.497126436781609
1523093,5,B00005JNRM,"This movie got inside my soul and spirit. I cannot explain, it stayed with me for days and even my husband. It is one of those movies that when you finish watching it you don't have to say anything, because you are on the same page with the person who watched it with you. This movie is about a woman on deathrow who requests the presence of a preacher (TD Jakes) and from there she reveals her story. A story of pain, anger, suffering, and freedom. This movie tells one woman's story but it is a story about many many women today. It needs to be told. And I am not going to reveal the storyline because I don't like telling a story. Just know you will be shaken, crying, angry, and pensive through this story.

One thing I will say is that you get glimpse of reality so close to home. Even if you're not a survivor- you will walk away feeling that there is something you need to let go. I recommend watching this movie with someone if you are a survivor of abuse because you WILL be triggered. It may call for a counseling session or prayer or the need to hold someone. Because it will speak to your heart and soul. Please see this movie.

This movie should ESPECIALLY be seen by men. Married men, single men, gay men...just men period. They need to know and then you need to share with your love one or partner.

In a desperate search for solace.  The very cynical, Michelle  still longs for the understanding from her ""extremely simple"" mother.  Thankfully, she does have the support of Twana (Debbie Morgan) along, with her friend Nicole, who has issues of her own.

1523095,5,B00005JNRM,"Based on Bishop T.J. Jakes' novel and stage play, this is a brutal, honest, and wonderfully acted film on the abuse of young women (statistics: 1 in 3 women have been molested between the ages of 5 and 15). It's a topic not often talked about, fermenting in silence, guilt, and anger, and so often will be continued from one generation to the next. This is what happens in this story, as Cassey, abused by her father, ends up with a boyfriend that rapes her daughter Michelle.
This award winning film shows how with the right script and fine acting, one can make a riveting film on a shoestring budget. The story is told in flashback, as Michelle tells Bishop Jakes about her life, both sitting in her jail cell, as she makes a house with no door, out of matchsticks.

The cast is superb: Kimberly Elise is Michelle, the central character, Loretta Devine is Michelle's mother Cassey, Debbi Morgan is Twana, Cassey's attractive, youthful mother, Clifton Powell is Reggie, Cassey's boyfriend, and Michael Boatman is Todd, the man who has always loved Michelle. Much of the film is extremely emotional, especially in the sections when the actors talk directly to the camera, a staging concept that is more like a play, but is very effectively used here.
The DVD gives the option of widescreen play and full screen, and for this particular film, I prefer the full screen, because so much is captured in the facial close-ups.

Bishop T.D. Jakes is one of the great preachers of our time, and is also an author of many books, a playwright, a musician and singer, and the human dynamo that leads the mega-church known as The Potter's House in Dallas, Texas.
Well paced direction by Michael Schultz, an almost classical score by Todd Cochran, and some great editing add to the overall excellence of the film.
This is so much more than a Christian film, and should be seen by all women, because this tragic problem spans every race and social strata, and in this film you will see your sister, your friend, possibly yourself. It is for those ""countless women whose stories remain untold"", and all those relationships that have been hurt by the silence.
Total running time is 94 minutes.",1116633600,28,2177,4.711286089238845
1523096,3,B00005JNRM,"When I first rented this movie, I was pretty excited.  Despite the fact that I had read a few not so great reviews about this movie when it was in theatres, I was eager to see the film for myself.

 The movie starts with the main character Michelle on death row receiving a visit from Bishop T.D. Jakes.  Michelle Jordan is a tortured soul of a woman who was molested as a child by her mother's boyfriend.  She then takes the wrong path and becomes a drug-addicted stripper before finally ending up in prison.  The first big flaw with this movie is that the audience doesn't know anything about Michelle's middle or high school years, which I believe are essential for a more thorough explanation of her going down the wrong path in life.  The truth is that there are people in this world who have recovered from being sexually abused and who are living productive lives.  We cannot simply assume that Michelle did not develop other problems along the way and that she chose to ruin her life.  Through some narratives and very brief flashbacks, the audience can only assume that she was probably rebellious, hung around the wrong kids and was probably promiscuous.  Besides the obvious abuse, all that is known is the fact that her mother refused to believe her daughter was molested because of her fear of being alone.

 Michelle finally gets out of prison on parole and begins to try and straighten her life out.  Of course, her past rears its ugly head through former associations that believe she is still the same self-destructive woman she was before going to prison.  However, she manages to remain strong.  Bishop T.D. Jakes's church is having a revival that Michelle is attending in order to spark some healing in her life.  Unfortunately, the tarnished relationship between her and her mother ultimately cannot be healed.  Then on the final night of the revival, she carries the bloodstained dress she wore as a little girl when she was attacked by Reggie, her mother's boyfriend.  She lays down the dress at the altar, symbolizing healing from her past, but she comes face to face with Reggie.  He is facing is own demons and pleads for forgiveness when he sees her.  Not understanding how God can forgive him, she guns him down up at the altar.  This scene was among the most powerful of the movie.

 The plot of the story was very believable and real.  I applaud the fact that this film touched on some very serious issues and did not fall into the ""feel-good"" Christian category.  Fortunately, many women will be able to relate to the character of Michelle Jordan.  This movie had the potential to be great.  However, I must admit that it felt like maybe this play was rushed to the screen.  The cast was great, but with some more effort in the writing of the plot, this could have been a landmark film.  But the high point was Kimberly Elise.  She is one of the most talented actresses in Hollywood who has nothing but great things ahead for her.  She did an excellent job in portraying Michelle Jordan and Loretta Devine was admirable in her role as the mother.  The other actors in the film also did a great job.  T.D. Jakes plays himself in the movie and seemed to be a lot more effective in his scenes in the prison cell with Michelle.  But the scene in the crack house with the addicts was quite comical.  Each person is puffing away on a crack pipe, but then start to criticize each other's lives. Not to mention, the drug dealer tells everyone to be quiet so he can hear T.D. Jakes who is on television that they are all watching. The dealer then tries to shoot Reggie(He was one of the addicts) because he owed money. Now, I'm not trying to be cynical, but this scene was almost totally unbelievable.

I must now go back to the subject of the narratives.  They were interesting at times, however, I also believe that they had a negative impact on the movie.  It was almost as if they were used to take up more time in the movie and fill in holes in the plot.  That time could have been used incorporating additional scenes about Michelle and her mother's background.  Not to mention, there is a useless light romance that takes place with an old high school classmate.  The relationship pretty much goes nowhere and ends abruptly because of Michelle going back to prison for killing her attacker.  A disclaimer for this situation is that the movie takes place over one weekend.  It's just that the relationship didn't add anything to the movie.

 The movie's ending left the audience wondering.  It's left to us to decide or figure out what happened to Michelle.  Did she get a new trial?  Or was she executed and went on to eternal glory?  Because her house she was building had a door and windows, we can maybe assume that she was freed.  But was she freed in the natural to continue living and healing, or freed from her tormented life to live the heavenly one?  Who knows?  In the future, I hope to see more movies like this one. I just hope that they can get more of a backing from Hollywood so that budget and time constraints don't take away from the substance.",1116460800,5,5091,4.538461538461538
1523097,5,B00005JNRM,"Being a white man, I'm ashamed that this movie has gone virtually ignored in my predominately white church.  This is the most realistic, yet most hopeful, modern Christian movie I've seen to date.

The story starts with a shooting at the altar of a large church.  From there, it follows the deeply troubled past of Michelle, a beautiful young black woman bound by the sins of the past--sins committed by her and against her.  As the tale unfolds, it is impossible to remain emotionally uninvolved.  Her story is representative of many women.  It's one that needs to be heard.

From a moviemaking standpoint, ""Woman Thou Art Loosed"" succeeds on a number of levels.  The acting is superb.  The dialogue is poignant and humorous and gritty, while remaining generally unoffensive for a church-going audience.  The occasional documentary style inserts, in which certain characters provide monologues, seemed distracting at first; yet as it went on, these monologues gave us the insight we needed into each character's heartbreaking decisions.  The music, though overblown at a few points, is effective.

Perhaps my primary complaint is T.D. Jakes status of near-sainthood here.  We are forced, through the story, to become part of his audience.  On the other hand, his willingness to show the hypocrisy and deceptions within his own congregation are admirable and absolutely realistic.  Some of the scenes might be too much for children, but they are necessary to maintain the story's believability.

This movie provides moments of horror, humor, and honesty that are rarely seen or heard in church circles.  With such films, Christians might actually show once again that they can be relevant to the struggles of modern culture.  Well done!",1116460800,2,1736,5.161290322580645

((Spoilers)) A troubled young woman who was raped as a child by her mother's boyfriend ends up led down a path of drugs, prostitution and jail sentences. After what initially happened, she told her ""mother"" (and I use parentheses because I will never call a woman like that the worthy title of mother and in keeping with my point, didn't believe her), who then confronted the boyfriend about it only for him to threaten to leave her, calling her fat and saying how she won't be able to find anyone else. Desperate for his ""love"" (which included cheating on her on numerous times over the years they stay together and still denying to her face what he did years later), she stays with him at the expense of her daughter's well-being. Disgusting. So nowadays, he ""found God"" in spite of him making no type of real amends or apologies for his past actions, the broken young woman is confronted by him in church (ostensibly with ""God's love"" in his heart), but she doesn't know it and ends up shooting him dead in front of everyone, including her stupid, weak-willed ""mother"". He apparently goes to heaven for being ""saved"" while she is sent to death row. I'm shocked at what a warped message that is. So you can rape a little girl, get away with/never admit to it and go to heaven when you die just because you accepted him in your life? Awful. Yes, murder is always extreme, but none of the mitigating factors even bothered in the ensuing aftermath, but rather ""Oh, you shot that man in the middle of church. Shame on you. No one cares about past, you deserve to be put to death."" God forgave him, but not her??? Why didn't God ever do anything to save or redeem or even protect this poor woman? In my opinion, she never stood a chance; everyone (including him) who was supposed to be there for her just let her down instead. I know such hardships happen in real life, too but to try and present this film as a feelgood ""Christian"" film is reprehensible. I'm also disappointed to see that T. D.
