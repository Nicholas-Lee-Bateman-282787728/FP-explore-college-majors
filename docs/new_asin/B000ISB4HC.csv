8147320,4,B000ISB4HC,"Someone goes on a bus journey. The heavens he gets to are a high pass. No-one changes much from their experiences, it's just a case of enjoying the panoply of human, very comic characters.
The young traveller is on a quest to secure an inheritance for his orphaned nephew. He is beset by a vamp whose aim is to take his virginity - his wedding night has been interrupted by the call to the quest.
The bus driver is happy to let the young man take over the wheel of the bus but insists on a diversion to his mother's birthday party. the local politician is rather good - gun wielding, full of speeches and generally keen on modernising. There is a (Bunuel) trademark dream sequence in which the young hero muddles the women in his life.
This film was a big success in France when it came out.",1375228800,3,791,4.315436241610739
