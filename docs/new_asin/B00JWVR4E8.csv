8654303,4,B00JWVR4E8,"Yes, this series is fluff but it's well written, well acted and is a cross between Cinderella and Lucy and Ricky but Ricky has an English accent. Add Maria Von Trapp with a kick-ass theme song (written by Anne Hampton Calloway and sung by her and her sister, Liz Callaway) and you have ""athe Nanny.""

There are some excellent guest stars that include Cher, Richard Kind, Roger Clinton and a recurring Ann Morgan Guilbert.

Yes, it's fluff but not the incipid stuff that's ""Married With Children"" or ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" it's fun. It's family. And Fran Drescher is charming and talented with great comic timing.

Forget your troubles and smile.

It's dated inits sexism, both anti female and anti male. But it's charming and fun. We live in an Upper West Side mansion with a Broadway Producer, no crime and the problems everyone has are cute.",1519430400,,847,4.780821917808219
8654304,4,B00JWVR4E8,"This 1993-94 Season of this one-of-a-kind sitcom starring Fran Drescher as the warm-hearted, nasal-voiced nanny from Queens who lands a job caring for three children of a wealthy, widowed Broadway producer from Manhattan. During the show's 6-year run (1993-1999), on CBS.

Drescher dazzles as Fran Fine in a role she created and developed (as writer and producer in several episodes) and obviously relishes, whether she''s flirting, whining, sparring, or showcasing her sensational wardrobe. The three-disc collection features 22 episodes beginning with ""The Pilot,"" when Fran knocks on the Sheffield's door and is mistakenly hired as their new nanny, establishing the show's shtick of ""blue collar meets blue blood."" Immediate chemistry between Nanny Fine and Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy, ""Days of Our Lives"") fuels the storylines whilst the sarcastic repartee of Sheffield''s snotty assistant, C.C. Babcock (Lauren Lane) and the British butler, Niles (Daniel Davis) further ignites the entertainment. Season highlights include ""The Butler, the Husband, the Wife, and Her Mother,"" when the family enters a parallel universe in a hilarious turn of events; and ""Imaginary Friend,"" the season's turning point where Drescher's physical comedy (inspired by Lucille Ball) is given free reign.

Celebrity guests include Carol Channing, Cloris Leachman, and Patti LaBelle (in the finale). Don't miss the bonus material: a heartwarming ""making-of"" retrospective with the cast, and Drescher's audio commentary during ""I Don't Remember Mama."" Mild profanity and sexual innuendo.",1515628800,,1579,5.8311688311688314
8654305,5,B00JWVR4E8,"I bought season 1 of The Nanny as a birthday present for my cousin who just turned 12.  HE LOVES IT and now wants to get all the episodes.  It makes him and his mother laugh.  I got it for him, because I remember really enjoying this show.  It helps to be Jewish to understand some of the humor and, of course, the Yiddish.  Grandma Yetta was my favorite, and I now refer to my cousin as Schmooey, the name she gave to Brighton, the young boy in the show.  I can't wait for my cousin to see the episode with the late, great Ray Charles, with the humor based on his blindness.  I also loved the episode when everyone has to stay over in Flushing during the holidays because of the horrible weather.  Maybe I'll buy the other seasons of The Nanny for him forHanukah.",1505347200,,764,4.184931506849315

8654309,4,B00JWVR4E8,"The series that took nannying to the next level.

Great release, the episodes appear aged due to TriStar using videotape but other than that great.
The only issue I have is these are the 2002 prints that aired on Lifetime.
I do wish the TriStar Television logo was intact.",1411689600,,272,4.551020408163265
8654310,5,B00JWVR4E8,"This show is spectacular! I love it so much! My mom and I used to watch every episode as it was aired on tv. Now, we can watch it again! Just a little tip. I bought Mt copy at Walmart for $5. Don't waste almost $15 when you can just buy it at a store for cheaper. Other than that, I highly recommend this show to everyone who asks me for recommendations (which is a lot.)",1405036800,,371,3.8947368421052633
8654311,1,B00JWVR4E8,"Ummmmm,  since Season 1 of The Nanny was released in July of 2005, why then is it being re-released again?  Why can't the focus of all this effort and expense be geared towards working on the release of Seasons 4, 5 and 6  which for some unknown illogical reasons still have not been released?",1399420800,12,293,4.388888888888889
