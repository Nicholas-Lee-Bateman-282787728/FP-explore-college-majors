4429001,5,B004M9QNVK,Except for the awkward shape and size of the box (making it hard to leave in it and store with the regular DVDs) this set is amazing for royal lovers like myself and a informative to those with just a passing glance at the royals (like my mother who is now turning into me and giving out royal facts at random),1394928000,7,310,4.098360655737705
4429002,5,B004M9QNVK,I knew I'd really like it when I ordered it but I have to say I truly enjoyed it and have watched it in it's entirety twice now and plan to watch it all again....Terrific !,1391904000,7,172,3.8055555555555554
4429003,5,B004M9QNVK,"This is a wonderful collection of films. They have had varying degrees of critical acclaim but all are well acted, interesting, and worth seeing more than once.",1389312000,,160,4.962962962962963
4429004,5,B004M9QNVK,"very fascinating set. info on Kings/Queens back to Victoria's time. for those interested in British Royal history, this is a worthwhile investment. I especially enjoyed the DVD featuring King George and Queen Mary (William's great-grandparents). After viewing the background DVDs I can see just how much modernizing has taken place in the Monarchy.",1383523200,10,348,5.584905660377358
4429005,4,B004M9QNVK,"George and Mary, Victoria's Children, the Coronation etc. all very enjoyable. The only problem with Victoria's Children is that it kind of ends mid story - it's easy to find info on them as youngsters. We can read about their weddings and deaths. Other than Leopoldo, we weren't given any insight into life beyond the statistics.",1381104000,,329,4.892857142857143
4429006,5,B004M9QNVK,"I am an avid British history buff and I have to say this collection is excellent. There are things about the Royal Family that I didn't know about, such as Queen Victoria's children. The commentaries are very good. I highly recommend this DVD collection.",1376092800,24,254,4.795454545454546
4429007,5,B004M9QNVK,"The information on the first video alone--""Queen Victoria's Children"" was worth the price of the set to me. I appreciated all the archival footage and the fact that Victoria's darker side gets as much screen time as her accomplishments.",1375228800,24,236,5.076923076923077
4429008,4,B004M9QNVK,"This collection arrived in a wonderful decorative box. Inside the box was four separate DVDs of the Monarch and family. For a collection that displayed old and somewhat rare footage, the picture was better than what was expected however, very little new info was added that a loyal Royal watcher would not have already seen. If you are just starting your journey of the Royals, this would be a great set to lead you down the path. If you are a Royal watcher, this of course is a must have set.",1374537600,26,493,4.428571428571429
4429009,5,B004M9QNVK,Ordered this set of DVD's for my wife because she loves the queen. She was so happy with them and has loved watching them.,1372204800,4,122,4.125

4429011,5,B004M9QNVK,I like that I can buy 4 DVDs in one package.  It's a nice selection about Britain's royal family.,1466380800,,97,4.105263157894737
4429012,1,B004M9QNVK,We received a Canadian format DVD which is unplayable on Australian DVD players. Please replace with an Australian playable DVD.,1465689600,,128,5.45

4429016,4,B004M9QNVK,"Awesome collection for fans of British films and at a terrific price! Blu-rays are packaged in a nifty, regal-looking box. Would've given the set 5 stars but one of the films (Vanity Fair) didn't have Closed-Captioning (CC), which is essential for the hearing-impaired. Having CC also helps even normal-hearing viewers understand British accents that can be difficult to decipher!",1459900800,6,380,5.4576271186440675
4429017,4,B004M9QNVK,"I have viewed all but one of the collection and enjoyed the variety and quality of each film very much.  Were it not for the fact I have not viewed them all at this time I would probably have given it five stars.  The one I have not yet viewed is ""Vanity Fair"" as I am now reading the book.  I wanted to read it before I viewed it as I felt this would enhance my viewing experience and the book was on hand. I feel confident once I do view the last film that I will enjoy it as much as the others.  I will view them again that much too is certain.  I had seen various reviews critical of the visual or sound quality but do not let that persuade you to deny yourself this collection.  Should anyone be considering this collection I encourage them to proceed with the purchase as they will in all probability enjoy it very much.",1448582400,2,826,4.067901234567901

4429041,5,B004M9QNVK,"Very Good Collection.  I bought it first because I wanted to get King George and Queen Mary, the Royals who saved the Monarchy.  I found it wasn't available as just it - I had to buy this set to get that.  I already had Queen Victoria's Children in my library, but I found the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and How to Be A Prince very interesting.  Over the years, I have seen snippets of the Coronation and marveled at how glamorous she was that day and seeing the whole ceremony was beautiful.

4429063,3,B004M9QNVK,"I was trying to be thrifty in purchasing this set of bluray movies as I love most of the British films, especially The King's Speech and Young Victoria. But to my disappointment, forty minutes into The King's Speech the disc started freezing and skipping. Now I know my eight month old Sony 3 Bluray player is not to blame because it is an awesome quality player that plays my old dvd and new bluray discs with no problems. It has to be a manufacturing defect during transfer process because there are no scratches or blemishes and I cleaned it and viewed it several times. I will have to view all of the discs in the set before deciding if I have to just buy all of the original blurays separately. I would rather they be of better quality to last long term in my library. I will update my review to let you know of the outcome.
