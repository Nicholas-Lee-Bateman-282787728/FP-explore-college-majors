1922731,5,B0000DBJ27,"My grandson of 15 months loves this series from the early 2000.  The actors are upbeat and engaging with happy giggles dispersed throughout the wonderful lessons learned.  I don't know if he's learned any lessons at his age, but maybe subconciously it will sink in.  He will not ride in the car without screaming for the Berenstain Bears dvds.  I have the whole series with these same actors.  The older versions are more subdued and he doesn't stay with it as he does with this group of actors.  There is a catchy song and a happy upbeat nature to this group.  I've tried Elmo dvds, but he actually prefers the Berenstain bears.  It's strange, but he loves them!",1267056000,2,663,4.559322033898305
