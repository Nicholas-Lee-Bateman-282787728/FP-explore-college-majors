3946623,5,B002LFPAUM,"Rowan Atkinson was funny as Mr. Bean, but he was downright hilarious as the Black Adder. He had such a talent for playing the sharp-tongued rogue I'll never figure out why he decided to start doing comedy in which he hardly spoke. The premise of this British comedy series is that the central character, ""The Black Adder"", shows up at different points in history in various incarnations distorting historical events and poking fun at various British historical figures and situations along the way.

Lots of people don't like Black Adder I, in which the title character, Edmund, is the younger son of a brutish man consumed with thoughts of war who actually becomes king of England through Edmund's own bungling - he arrives late for the Battle of Bosworth Field and winds up chopping off the head of Richard III, thus saving the life of Henry Tudor. Throughout this first season he plays the buffoon, often having the expression of a deer caught in the headlights. This is the only season in which the Black Adder takes on the persona of a weak effeminate person. Especially funny is Edmund's mother who is a proper noble woman sitting around doing embroidery and indifferently waiting for the next marauding army to pass through.

The second season takes place early during the reign of Elizabeth I, with the Black Adder confident, handsome, and even a favorite at court. A young Amanda Richardson plays the role of Elizabeth I, who comes across as Betty Boop, just not as intelligent. Although more cunning in this season, Black Adder still comes up the loser in just about every episode. My favorite is ""Bells"", in which Blackadder finds his new servant, Bob, curiously pleasant company. Afraid for his reputation at court, Blackadder searches for a ""cure"" - which of course involves leeches, until Bob conveniently reveals that she is in fact a girl called Kate. Their wedding is disrupted by the profane Lord Flashheart, who, although he is the best man, winds up stealing the bride.

The third season takes place in the eighteenth century during the reign of George III, and will be a favorite of all fans of ""House, M.D."" due to the presence of a young Hugh Laurie. Here, Black Adder plays the manservant of the Prince Regent, George, played by Hugh Laurie. George is the dim-witted target of Black Adder's many schemes to enrich himself by taking advantage of his cushy position in George's household, and this often means having to save the Prince Regent's pension and position in the kingdom, which is largely controlled by Parliament.

The fourth season takes place during World War I, with Edmund Blackadder as a captain in the British army whose company is trapped in one of the trenches that gave everyone in Europe such a distaste for warfare between the two world wars. Blackadder's aim in this season is to stay alive by staying in that trench until the war ends. His stunts include shooting a carrier pigeon when it arrives with orders to advance, and joining the Royal Flying Corp - ""the twenty minuters"". Unfortunately, the name comes from how long they are expected to live once in the air, not how much time they work each day, as Blackadder had originally thought.

This show has several interesting plot devices. First, most of the main characters show up in different periods of time with the same name but different roles. Hugh Laurie is always ""George"", Tony Robinson is always ""Baldrick"", Stephen Fry is always ""Melchett"", and Tim McInnerny is always ""Percy"". Since each season was shot in alternate years - (1983, 1985, 1987, 1989) - the cast must have been having a terrific time in order for them to be regathered after such long intervals in order to make filming this series possible. Secondly, everyone in the cast, including the Black Adder, always dies in the final episode of each season. It is somewhat like the South Park stunt of Kenny being killed at the end of every show only to reappear in the next episode as though nothing had happened.

Do note that there are only six episodes per season. If you liked ""Red Dwarf"" or ""Fawlty Towers"", you'll probably like this series too.

As for extra features, disc five contains the specials. The Cavalier Years has Stephen Fry as King Charles and Warren Clarke as Oliver Cromwell.  There is also Blackadder's Christmas Carol and Back and Forth. Christmas Carol is pretty funny, but I've never cared for Back and Forth.

Disc six contains the documentary Blackadder Rides Again, a 90-minute special with the behind-the-scenes rehearsal footage from the fourth season included. There's also a look back at the costumes used in Costumes Revisited, along with extended interviews and audio commentaries with the key actors. As for the audio commentaries, Rowan Atkinson, Stephen Fry, Ben Elton, Richard Curtis, Tony Robinson, Tim McInnerny and producer John Lloyd have all contributed to these.",1250380800,322,4876,4.8863361547763
3946624,5,B002LFPAUM,"You have to give the Blackadder family credit -- they're tenacious. ""Black Adder - The Complete Collector's Set"" chronicles this odd, sardonic family's presence throughout the greatest eras of British history. The first season stumbles somewhat, but the following seasons are brilliant -- sardonic, kooky, and sometimes rather sick.

On the day of the Battle of Bosworth Field, the Duke of York (Brian Blessed) and his son Harry (Robert East) accompanied the king (Peter Cook) into battle. His second son Edmund (Atkinson) hopes to come along, but he oversleeps -- and when he arrives, he accidentally kills the king, and Edmund's his father is made king. He dubs himself the ""Black Adder"" and decides to one day become king of England... too bad nobody likes him.

He's followed by a string of descendents through the ages -- all more acid-tongued and intelligent than he, or anyone else around them. And they're always accompanied by a Baldrick. That includes Lord Edmund Blackadder, the favorite of the demented queen Bess (Miranda Richardson); Edmund Blackadder Esq., valet and butler to the half-witted Prince Regent (Hugh Laurie); and Captain Blackadder, a soldier in World War I who spends his time trying to get out of it.

These unlucky Blackadders find themselves dealing with demented Puritans, hosting bawdy drinking parties, crazed bishops, even crazier princes, giant turnips, the Red Baron, drag musical acts, Spaniard inquisitors, and almost being shot for eating a carrier pigeon. Startlingly, the final season -- although another is in the planning stages -- ends on a very poignant note.

But there is an upbeat ending overall -- the final episode introduces us to the modern-day Blackadder, a sharp-tongued aristocrat dining with the modern-day descendents of Prince George, Queen Elizabeth, Melchett and Darling. Not to mention Baldrick in a truly horrifying porno apron.

Blackadder reveals that using da Vinci's plans, Baldrick has constructed a time machine, and bets 30,000 that he can bring back historical items. It's actually an elaborate scam... until the machine works, and Baldrick and Blackadder find themselves spinning helplessly through time, with no idea how to get home. And in a couple of side-stories, Ebenezer Blackadder discovers how his pleasant cheery attitude will affect his descendents; and the last two Loyalists to King Charles (in other words, Baldrick and Blackadder) deal with the impending execution of the king ( ""No, it's not! It's a huge pumpkin with a pathetic moustache drawn on it!"").

The series starts off a little weakly -- the first season is funny, but not outrageously so, and Prince Edmund is the incompetant twerp rather than Baldrick or Percy. But things blossom with the arrival of a new writer in ""Blackadder II,"" and sets the tone for the rest of the series: a smart, bitter man who's constantly surrounded by nincompoops.

There are one or two dud episodes, but the majority of them shine with comic genius, from the kookily childish Queen Elizabeth (""Who's Queen?"") to Baldrick's rancid boxers killing the dinosaurs. Atkinson gets most of the good lines (""He's the most over-rated human being since Judas Iscariot won the AD31 Best Disciple Competition"") but the rest of the cast usually gets in some great ones too (""A total pig-headed unwillingness to look facts in the face will see us through!"").

Atkinson, of course, rules the whole series a series of acid-tongued Blackadders who have influence but no power, and Robinson is great as the gross servant who always has a cunning plan. The rest of the cast reappears regularly -- Laurie as a series of half-witted bluebloods, Richardson as drippy young women, Fry as cunning advisors and hearty generals, and McInnery as airbrained idiots and prissy assistants.

Aside from being polished up in the remastering process, apparently this edition is going to have deleted scenes, audio commentaries (YAY!) and interviews. It's probably not worth the shell-out if you already own the whole thing, but definitely is if you don't.

The complete series of ""Black Adder"" is a comic cornucopia -- it starts off a bit weakly, but once it gets its footing, it's absolute hilarious. A must-have.",1250208000,29,4209,5.149341142020498
3946635,5,B002LFPAUM,"I was first introduced to Black Adder by way of my local PBS station, when they aired them in season runs during their Sharathons, offering up DVD sets up at 50.00 a season. I never got the sets, but set my VCR to record the Black Adder segments of the marathon. I kept the VHS tapes for a long time until that sad day I was forced to drastically downsize my VHS collection. I have since came across this very set in a library edition that I borrow from the library from time to time.

Alas, the dvd's are scratched and unwatchable, but thanks to Amazon I have procured a good used copy from them for under 30 for the entire series, and eagerly await its arrival.

I was excited that the set included a time-traveling Adder and Baldrick which was filmed ten years after the series. My only criticism was the sound level. Often it would be too loud followed by to faint so I had to keep the volume controls at the ready and I feel that this problem could have been fixed during the remastering process. Nonetheless, I can recommend this DVD set.

3946754,5,B002LFPAUM,"Black Adder: If you love dark humor, dirty humor, humor based on languages and slapstick situations, this is for you!
I knew Rowan Atkinson from Mister Bean and I have to say he made me laugh hysterically at times.
Then I discovered Black Adder and another angle of Rowan Atkinson genius... He can be as funny with his wit than with his grimaces...
The Black Adder Seasons are a bit uneven:
- Season 1... The worst of the whole serie. Sometimes painful to watch, more especially when you have already seen the rest. The action era is the middle age and the Black Adder is a younger son of the king.
- Season 2: Still in the middle age, this season is much better by far than the first one. The action era is also the middle age but this time Black Adder is from the nobility and the potential victim of a mad queen vices... Very funny season...
- Season 3: The action is now during the French Revolution and the regence in UK. Black Adder is now the butler of the Prince regent, briliantly played by Hugh Laurie.
- Season 4: It now seems that Black Adder has lost his links to the nobility. The action takes place in the trenches during WW1. Hugh Laurie is still there and still as funny. This season, although being still hilarious shows a different Black Adder temper. He is now trying to avoid the nefarious effects of the War and he seems much more concerned in saving his life than advance his rank in the society.

- There are some good extras in this CD box. Although it says Remastered, I do not recall seing a huge improvement when compared with my original recordings of the serie.

We bought this as a gift however and didn't have time to return it so we quickly tested each of the discs to ensure they played correctly (which they did) and resigned ourselves to giving the gift anyway.

For anyone who doesn't know Blackadder, we would highly recommend skipping disc 1 (series 1) as it was well known back in the UK as a bit of a bad start to the whole series. Major changes were made and from Series 2 onward, it is comedy genius.",1457222400,2,824,4.282051282051282

It felt rather like watching the person ahead of you in line at a bakery receive a beautifully decorated slice of cake, served on fine china; and then when it's your turn, the baker scoops up a wad of the same cake with his bare hand and slaps it onto a dirty paper plate and tosses it at you.  I mean, it's great cake, and I'm glad to have it, but I can't help but feel slighted and disappointed.  It wasn't what I thought I was paying for.",1453766400,2,735,4.266187050359712

3946787,5,B002LFPAUM,"Okey dokey...here is the brief...if you love British humor on the scale of 'Fawlty Towers', then, you will
love the Black Adders series. There is a lot less physical humor in the Adder series and more tasty bon
mots; so this entire series should be sub-titled, ""The Art of The Insult"".

The main character, Edmund, the Black Adder, continually lambastes those of lower rank and peerage
than himself throughout each episode and throughout the series as he attempts to gain favor with his
higher ups thus gaining more power and money. The main target of his disdain and disgust is Baldrick,
his servant, as well as others too dense to understand his thinly veiled attacks.

The series characters are multi-generational descendants throughout British history. The titles are:
1.) 'The Black Adder', set in the fictional reign of ""Richard IV"".
2.) 'Blackadder II', was set during the reign of Elizabeth I.
3.) 'Blackadder the Third', set in the late 18th, early 19th centuries in the reign of George III.
4.) 'Blackadder Goes Forth', set in 1917, in the trenches of the World War I.

Now the eras don't really matter so much although the history of each period is used to launch some
very witty and hilarious jokes. No, you don't need to have passed your history class in high school to
get the jokes.

As a matter of fact the first series is set in a fictional reign of Richard IV in1485 at the end of the British
Middle Ages.  It is written as an alternative history in which King Richard III won the Battle of Bosworth
Field only to be mistaken for someone else and murdered. He is succeeded by Richard IV, one of two
Princes in the Tower imprisoned by Richard III. The second son from the tower is...Edmund, the Duke
of Edinburgh, aka Black Adder, who attempts in each episode to increase his standing with his father
and also wishes to overthrow him so he can be king.

One episode in the series has Black Adder hosting his extremely wealthy, virtuous relatives and a stag
party at the same time, in the same house. Switching between the two soirees as one gets more boring
and the other gets increasingly wild is fun to watch as, again, Black Adders life is not getting any better
as he tries to manage the mayhem.

It is not necessary to review each series but to let you know that there are a multitude of British actors
involved that you will recognize even if you don't recognize their names. Some of the actors are Stephen
Frye (A Bit of Frye and Laurie, The Hobbit), Hugh Laurie (House, Jeeves and Wooster), Miranda
Richardson (Harry Potter, Crying Game), Tim McInnery (Notting Hill, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes),
Robbie Coltrane (Harry Potter films, Henry V) and Brian Blessed (Star Wars Episode 1, Dr Who); some
of the best actors of the time are featured in this series. The actors are cast in different parts throughout
the series and do a fine comedic job.

The series also features some Shakespearean dialogue, usually adapted for comic effect with the credits
stating, ""Additional Dialogue by William Shakespeare"". Punking Shakespeare is the ultimate insult, yet
there are many more as the series progresses so stay tuned. You may or may not recognize the inserted
Shakespearean quatrains but it doesn't matter. The writers cleverly worked William's words into the script
and the actors are able to use the language to its advantage. You will be none the wiser and you will laugh
anyway. Believe me this is not high-brow entertainment. By the way, neither is Shakespeare.

If you are not a fan of put-down humor then you should resist the urge to watch these hilarious 30 minute
episodes that romp through history like a bull through a rose garden. I personally give it 5 Stars for its subtle
appreciation and irreverence for history as well as its acerbic and wicked wit throughout the entire series.
Shakespeare would be proud. After all, he wrote for the masses, peerage and royalty alike.",1447632000,6,3909,4.745213549337261

3946822,5,B002LFPAUM,"I am not here to write a review about the content of the four 'seasons' and various specials of Blackadder. Those buying this have already made the rational decision they need every piece of every piece of recorded Blackadder material.

I am one of those who had to have everything. I purchased this and watched it during a trip to England, both on the aircraft and early in the morning when jet lag woke me.

The quality of the videos is excellent, which is a great positive considering the source tapes are some what dated.

The extras are - as is very often the case - a mixed bag. I wasn't that impressed with Tony Robinson doing Baldrick in our universe.

There is a retrospective piece in which the main characters are interviewed that is touching and poignant, especially the material related to 'Goodbyee' in general and, in particular, the last few minutes of that episode. The director and writers discuss their unhappiness with the initial version and how, slowly, steadily and surely, they synthesized what may well be one of the greatest endings to a series 0f any genre. For those unaware, Blackadder was a broad parody and satire on English history with a rogue/scoundrel as the protagonist. The four seasons covered four periods in history: one where Richard III lived; a slapstick take on Elizabeth I; an even more slapstick take on George IV as Prince Regent, and a decidedly different toned look at the Western Front of WW!. While the first three seasons - and each of the specials - ends with hilarity, the last season ends with a grim and bitter assessment of how misguided it was for WW! to happen.

I was a casual fan of Rowan before this.  It was quite different to see him talk so much and be so hysterically sarcastic and cynical and narcissistic.

He is a smart man, irritated by the idiots surrounding him, commenting on the periods in history.  It's good if you like Rowan, or just British comedy in general.  Black Adder is not bullocks; if you think otherwise(you're entitled to your own opinion, of course), you're mad as a bicycle.",1402876800,,593,4.363636363636363

Each series (four in all) takes place during a different time period, but all, played brilliantly by Atkinson, are descendants of the Blackadder family. The first is set during the Middle Ages, with Atkinson playing a conniving and inept prince. The second follows a descendant who schemes in the court of Elizabeth I and the third is the story of a Blackadder who was fallen to the status of butler. Finally, the fourth occurs during WWI.
I absolutely adored this show and the set is packed with extra episodes and features. While it is not quite as silly as the Monty Python team, nor as academic, additional dialogue is supplied by Shakespeare, which is endlessly punned and butchered, all to hilarious effect.

The sketches are a little too silly for my tastes in many cases, but, here's the thing...as I watch it, I am liking it more and more. I think my initial disinterest was because the supporting actors/characters were all new to me. As they reappear in later episodes, I am beginning to appreciate their comic touches, as well, even bit players, like the messenger page who mirrors the hand gestures of the noblemen he brings news to... I am only on the 4th episode, so perhaps a more accurate assessment is that this series starts slowly, but grows on you.

3947038,5,B002LFPAUM,"This show took a while for me to appreciate when I first saw it 13 years ago on BBC America.  I agree that the first season wasn't that great, but not that bad either.  Edmund Black Adder was finding his ground, but that is all the more interesting.  Even the producers realised that this was the case.

I'm not sure what has been remastered about this edition, but if it has been remastered, I can imagine that the presentation before the remastering wasn't all that great.  This looks fairly average for a DVD, and there is a nice transfer with okay sound, but nothing spectacular like DTS 5.1 or anything like that.  I had to crank the volume on most of the episodes, but I would imagine it wasn't recorded very well from its inception.  I'm not a geek, only a consumer.  Its rather nice that these things don't look sparkly new because it adds to the nostalgia.

Otherwise, its nice to have this collection with the extras, which are very nice, including the interviews with the various cast members with a revisit to the costume archives.  There is also some footage from long ago when they were starting it all out.  I had no idea that Rowan Atkinson had such a following in his school days, but it can be seen from the included footage that his stage presentation depicted his prodigious talent.  The specials are wonderful with one I hadn't seen before shot before the millennium during the Y2K zeitgeist.  I'm now very glad to have this collection.",1357084800,4,1457,4.5576923076923075

3947046,5,B002LFPAUM,"Black Adder is unlike any TV series done before or since, a very silly, but also
very smart comedy, each season took place about a hundred years later than
the series before, but always with Rowan Atkinson playing Backadder.  However
each time not only the basic situation and story, but also Blackadder's character
was different.  True, he's basically always looking out for himself, but in one season
he might be a sniveling simp, the next might find him dashing, handsome and
caustically witty.  Some of the key supporting actors (including an the wonderful
Tony Robinson, and the always hysterical Hugh Laurie) go from season to season,
with Laurie playing a bevy of different roles, and Robinson the one true constant
as Blackadder's sad-sack abused and not very bright sidekick.

So rather than a TV series as we generally know it, what we really have is 4 different
series, in different eras, held together by casting.  Even the theme song is re-worked
each time (although using the same basic tune)

By casting from such a wide net, from setting it in the era of Richard III for season
1 (and getting in some wicked parody of the Shakespeare play), to the dark
absurdity of WW I by the last, we really have an overview of time that makes the
series resonate long after you finish it.

While personally I find, for example, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python more
consistently laugh out loud funny, I find I remember more of the story and
characters from Blackadder.

I'd urge everyone to give it a look, and keep in mind that the many find the
first season the most heady, and least funny.  It grows from there.

The quality on the remastered edition is a step up from the older DVDs,
but is far from spectacular, and really, no one is buying Blackadder for
visual quality anyway.  So if you want to save money, and the earlier version
is cheaper, you're not losing much.",1347840000,3,1875,4.651515151515151

3947064,5,B002LFPAUM,"the other reviewers have more than adequately extolled the virtues of this unique, brilliant series (from season 2 on, that is), but i must address the point they keep missing, and indeed one of the all-time great miscarriages of justice: that Rowan Atkinson, an absolute comic genius on a par with the likes of Jack Benny, Groucho Marx, Abbott & Costello, Red Skelton, Jackie Gleason, Peter Sellers, Mel Brooks, Steve Martin, Robin Williams, and all six Monty Pythons COMBINED, should end up being best known for something as pointless and puerile as MR.

not only had he already proven how much more he's capable of with BLACKADDER, but would shortly do so again with the small-town police ""Britcom"" THE THIN BLUE LINE. (also written by Ben Elton. coincidence, I wonder...?)
so if you are one of the multitude who wrote Atkinson off as a pathetic, infantile, class-clown-style goofball because you know him only as Bean, please reconsider. BLACKADDER (seasons 2-4 at any rate) will more than justify your leap of faith. as will THE THIN BLUE LINE.

However, there is a fly in the ointment with this particular release of the program: THE UNBELIEVABLY LOUD AND INTRUSIVE LAUGH TRACK. It is more than loud, for sometimes it overrides the dialog that is supposed to be inspiring you to laugh.

I enjoy Britcoms in large part because of the general absence of any indication as to how funny things are; these shows sometimes challenge, but more often are subte and are evidently funny on their own.

3947068,5,B002LFPAUM,"I'm not going to rehash the stories, since I've seen some very in-depth reviews that I can't improve upon. But here's my take:

I've never been a big fan of Mr. Bean; I see it as an SNL skit: great in 2-5 minute chunks, but damned boring in a feature film. The first time I saw Mr. Atkinson truly speak (in a standup show), I thought he was a comedic genius & wished for more. I only caught part of a Black Adder show on PBS (where he turned highwayman)and was hooked. When this set came out on a Gold Box deal, I hadn't thought about the show in years, but had to buy it. Best money I've spent in a while.

If you like British humor as well as intelligent sarcasm, you'll love this. Rowan Atkinson is great, but I doubt the show would be as good if it weren't for the fantastic supporting (?) cast. I was shocked to see Dr. House in drag and acting like a total moron (and doing so beautifully). My favorite character, though was Baldrick. He could always be counted on to come up with a 'cunning plan' to save the day.

My main advice, if you're not a huge history buff (or only learned history in a US public school) is to watch the 'Moments in History' bonus features first. This way you'll understand many of the references made and get more of the subtle jokes as they happen. I'm a public school educated history buff & missed quite a few references that made sense after I discovered this material.

Don't expect Monty Python or Benny Hill. They're both great, but this requires you to pay more attention. I love that about 'Black Adder' as too much comedy today is designed for those with short attention spans and no need for an education. I like 'The Blue Collar Comedy' series as much as the next guy, but intelligent humor is a rare blessing these days.

I've just finished ""Black Adder Goes Forth"" and look forward to finishing the set over the next few days. I have no doubt I'll be ready to repeat this experience on a big screen when I get home (I'm on vacation & watching on my laptop right now).",1318550400,4,2014,4.275590551181103
3947089,5,B002LFPAUM,"Black Adder is some of Britain's best comedy television, but it isn't for everyone. Yes, it has Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) but it's kind of intellectual, in that the series goes from historical period to historical period with the same cast of characters; ditzy queen, goofy and slightly pansy-ish nobleman, crafty scheming main character who gets too clever for his own good (Blackadder) and dull, loutish henchman (Baldrick.) The humor is not particularly high-brow; it's farce, to be sure. Not everyone appreciates farce, though it's said to be the highest and most difficult form of comedy to execute.

My own copy is old and decrepit, but we enjoyed it in three continents, when we worked overseas and the local tv was usually in a language we didn't speak, or we were limited to BBC International. I'm glad to get a remastered copy. This is one of my favorites. By the way, the popular Hugh Laurie (House) has some smaller roles in this series.

My favorite is probably Series 2, though Series 4 is very close.  I like Series 1 quite a bit also, which appears to be the minority opinion.  Series 3 is my least favorite by a long shot - strangely enough as I like Hugh Laurie.  Though the ending of Series 3 is really good.

I was torn on whether this should be a 4 or 5 star review, as I struggle with the lack of good female character (exceptions being the mother from Season 1, Queenie from Season 2 and the nurse from Season 4).

The special features really solidify this as a 5 star product.  The specials are very good, and tons and tons of interviews.  Plus, this is the first British show I've seen with subtitiles - even the interviews.  The discussion of the ending of Series 4 is really interesting, and informative of why it is the way it is.

3947096,5,B002LFPAUM,"I was turned onto Mr. Bean by a friend, who told me that he had seen it after searching for something to watch one night, and well we both agreed the show seemed silly from the clips and descriptions. Then he watched it and couldn't stop laughing, so he told me I Had to watch it. We have similar tastes, so I did. I was thoroughly impressed. My first foray into British comedy, and except for the half naked women running around, there wasn't much there to hold my interest. I thought British comedy was pretty bland and unfunny and a bit crude (but not the good kinda crude like Richard Pryor) But this changed my mind. So after seeing all the Bean episodes, I started looking for other things he's been in. So I went into the video store and found black adder, what I didn't know, and the salesperson didn't help me with, is that there are more than one series, and really they should be watched in order. I had bought one of the early years, and one of the wartime years. (the ending to me was rather dramatic for a comedy series, but fit the tone of the show) I have never watched these episodes from start to finish, as I am waiting to get this series (money reasons) I have seen the Christmas Carol (great irony) and the Back and Forth episode, which I loved. I Can't compare it to any ""season"" as i've never watched a full series. But it was great to see Rowan talking, and it was amazing how much of a prickly character he played. Mr. Bean was harmless like a little child, tossed into a grown up world. Black Adder was just downright bitter, and it was fun watching him take so much pleasure in playing the character. After watching this I also watched him in the Thin Blue Line (hopefully that is the right name of it)in which he played a police chief. But, it was black adder that showed his range and his live show (now on dvd) that told me how funny he could be and how british humor could be.  Maybe he is an anomaly lol. Either way this collection is for people who both love Black Adder or anyone who loves  great tv shows. I am rather a tv snob, so it's rare i give any show this kind of reccomendation. But it is one of the classics, but it's still fresh today, not only because of the writing, but since the show takes place in different time periods it rather avoids the ""dated"" problem. Now, remember I have not watched all the episodes, so this review is based on what I have seen. I'm sure anyone who is reading this is already curious as to what Black Adder is and whether or not it's funny, and I just  want to let anyone who is on the borderline that you should buy this and share it without everyone you know, because this is one freaking funny show that should not be missed out on.",1308182400,3,2711,4.219653179190751
3947097,5,B002LFPAUM,"Rowan Atkinson is best known for his Mr. Bean character but his best performance is without a doubt Blackadder. The first Blackadder is rather weak and foolish but becomes the master schemer in the following seasons and Rowan's deadpan delivery of his lines along with a stellar supporting cast bring a refreshing boost to comedy.

American audiences will have to adjust their perceptions a bit to understand and appreciate english humor but it is well worth a look especially during the Blackadder the Third series which I found the best along with Blackadder goes forth (the ending is quite moving and you have to watch the entire season to really appreciate it).

Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry and Tony Robinson truly help make the series stand out and give Blackadder his springboard to truly entertain the audience. The DVD set includes all the seasons along with the TV Specials (the christmas episode is original and hilarious) and looks well enough on a high definition TV considering the age of the show.

3947151,5,B002LFPAUM,"If you are a fan of British comedy, like me and many others you see before me, then you must buy this Blackadder collection.

Some people may moan about the dreadful job they did of remastering it for sound and vision but i personally see the quality of the material that I am viewing and that i will undoubtedly view again many, many times.

The cast of the four series and specials are marvelous. Rowan Atkinson plays Edmund Blackadder so well you forget that he is more famously known around the globe for playing Mr Bean.

His supporting cast of Tony Robinson (Baldrick) Tim McInnerney (Lord Percy/Captain Darling) Stephen Fry (Lord Melchett/General Melchett) Miranda Richardson (Queen Elizabeth I) Brian Blessed (King Richard IV) and Hugh Laurie (Prince George IV/Lieutenant George) are simply magnificent.

""The Black Adder"" penned by Richard Curtis (Love Actually) and Rowan Atkinson was full of high production and expensive location shoots and the characters of Blackadder and Baldrick were not totally thought out and resulted in mixed views by critics and viewers alike but a thundering performance from Brian Blessed makes this series enjoyable.

Blackadder II scaled production down to two sets and brought in writer Ben Elton to re-write the characters of Blackadder & Baldrick. He ended up effectively switching the roles of the two characters from the first series, Making Blackadder much more intelligent, cynical and conniving and Baldrick much more simple and idiotic. This proved to be the recipe for success and when Blackadder hit British screens in 1985 critics praised it and viewers took it to their hearts.

From then on, the hits kept on coming. Blackadder The Third brought more of the same recipe except this time Edmund was butler to the bumbling Prince Regent George IV who takes a week to put on a pair of trousers and has no idea what a robber button is (Anyone?)

But the Blackadder series ended on a high, literally going ""over the top"" in Blackadder Goes Forth. This is arguably the greatest series of Blackadder in which he is now Captain Blackadder of the British Army fighting (or avoiding it at any cost) in the trenches of World War I with his division of Lieutenant George and Private Baldrick and his superior, who's about 35 miles behind them, General ""Insanity"" Melchett whose invitation to a mass slaughter they all begrudgingly accepted. The final scene will give you a lump in your throat.

Most people here are probably already aficionados of the show. I love it for its intelligence, clever lines, and history (as well as the puns and bad jokes), and the fact that it shares aspects in common with a really good play.

I agonized for months over whether to ""duplicate"" my purchase of the previous boxed set with this one. When it went on sale again, I finally took a chance and bought it and in my case am quite glad I did! I already knew I loved the material, and I read the general opinion that the remastering was good but not necessarily good enough to buy the set. It turns out to be a pretty high quality box set, both in ""build quality"" (if you will) and content.

The set comes in a comparatively solid outer box (pictured on the product page), into which the disc set slides like a book. The discs themselves are in a ""booklet"" of thin but sturdy plastic disc holders (which securely hold the discs but the discs are not too difficult to get out) and ""bound"" in a nice cardboard cover with an etching-like picture covering Edmund through series I to IV. The outer cover folds out into ""Baldrick's Family Tree"" which contains ""Primeval Soup,"" ""Worms,"" ""Viagra,"" and the like, and a lot of ""Baldricks."" The discs also look nice and are clearly labeled with their contents. After having purchased some quality shows with really flimsy disc packaging, this was a nice surprise.

But the real treat is the new content. These are the extras labeled on the respective discs; and most of the discs have extras.

EDIT:

I am working my way through the set; and I have to say I am very glad to have it. It might be just because I have old equipment, but the remasters look a lot better than the previous edition on my setup. I love having the book format instead of the fold-out; it's easier to find the disc I am interested in and get it out. I love the commentaries so far (have just listened to series 2 and commentaries). For some reason they didn't do any commentaries on series 1, which I found a big disappointment. As it wasn't one of my favourite series, I was really interested in what they thought about it, and what it was like making it. I enjoyed the commentaries for series 2, although for some reason when they mixed ""Money"" with Tony Robinson and Tim McInerny, they mixed the episode full-volume and you couldn't hear them half of the time, so that was disappointing.

Blackadder is a villain of the worst type, literally, as he is devious but grossly incompetent and very unlucky. The various incarnations of Blackadder between the seasons helps to showcase Atkinson's comic genius as he plays each character perfectly to maximum humorous effect.

This is a great series and I was glad to find it since we wanted to show it to my kids.

3947189,5,B002LFPAUM,"Blackadder is a British comedy that follows the lives of the royal ""Blackadder"" line, a lineage that seems to produce nothing but sniveling cowards who are always trying to shirk duty and avoid all sense of obligation. Produced in four seasons, with each season taking place at a specific time in history, the series commences in season one with the life of Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), a son of the English King (Brian Blessed) in the 15th century. As the seasons progress, we move forward in time until ultimately arriving in season four with a certain ""Captain Blackadder"" in the trenches in World War I. The premise of the show, then, is to watch the machinations of the current Blackadder as he squirms his way through each threatening situation while continuing his quest to wiggle ever higher up in life, whether that be to become King (as in season one) or to escape the trenches of World War I (as in season four). The show is one of the most successful comedies to ever come out of the BBC.

The character of Edmund Blackadder begins in season one as the Duke of Edinburgh (his accidental killing of Richard III over the misappropriation of a horse seems to cause him some serious difficulties about this time, with a little help from Shakespeare), and episodes revolve around Blackadder either attempting to seize control of the throne or, in the other cases, trying to keep from being executed due to his shenanigans. Without giving any of the story lines away, we can say that each season sees Blackadder incarnated in the form of one of the descendants of the Blackadder line, and so Edmund's character shows up, first in the Middle Ages, then in the Renaissance, and finally, in World War I. Over this span of some 600 years (specifically, 1485 - 1917), we see that for one to be a ""Blackadder"" carries a whole series of connotations with it, this being the underlying theme of the show in all its contorted situations and events.

Edmund Blackadder is not the only recurring character throughout the seasons. His dogsbody is Baldrick (Tony Robinson), who is also present in every episode in the entire series. Other actors (including Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, and Tim McInnerny) who appear as key characters in one season will frequently appear as different characters other seasons. Each of the supporting actors is outstanding, and although Blackadder is clearly Atkinson's show, all the actors work together to pull the effort off seamlessly. Many of the special characters are famous British actors and/or comedians, but it is not necessary to know that as you watch the episodes.

To a certain extent, ""Blackadder"" defies categorization as a TV show. It certainly is a comedy, and a sardonic, cynical one at that. However, the series is so vested in British history that one almost feels you are receiving a series of lessons on British history rather than just watching a comedy show. And while it is not necessary to be fully aware of the major events of British history in order to enjoy the show, it certainly helps to bring a richer enjoyment to the experience, and you also won't miss the numerous history-oriented ""asides,"" ""caricatures,"" and allusions that fill the show. The other side of the coin, so to speak, is that by watching the entire series, you can get a ""mini"" British history lesson on an almost subconscious level.

The show is indeed extremely funny, but this is a distinctively ""British"" show. If you are an American viewer and are not familiar with this type of humor, there may be a short period of adjustment, but after one or two episodes, understanding the humor becomes second-nature. True, there is much similarity in Rowan Atkinson's style of humor and the type of humor commonly seen in America, but there is certainly also that little added ""twist"" that may take typical American viewers a little time to absorb. Once you do, it is straight laughs all the way. And it is not all high-brow: there are sight gags, physical humor, and yes, even occasional crassness. This is history for people who don't take history all too seriously, and Blackadder in a way epitomizes all that we average people feel as we go through life, regardless of the historical backdrop operating during our lives.

Some viewers may be aware of Atkinson's other very famous and popular series, ""Mr. Bean."" Let's be clear and explain that there is virtually no relationship between these two shows, which have different premises, a different comedic approach, and are generally aimed at different audiences. To think that Rowan Atkinson successfully completed an engineering degree at Oxford and ended up playing Edmund Blackadder is a stretch, at best. And yet, once you see him in action, you can easily see how this came about. He is like a little kid in class, always wishing to pull the string on the person's clothes sitting next to him, or perhaps placing the proverbial whoopee cushion under the teacher's chair. In a very real way, it all seems a natural, un-acted role for him.

Blackadder season four was voted in 2000 by the British Film Institute as the 16th best British TV series in all the BBC's history. The previous three seasons are every bit as good, and it is likely that the strong political themes underpinning season four played into the rating. Let's just say that, in spite of its occasional crudity and offensiveness (yes, we may be offended at a few things here and there - the show is an equal opportunity lancet), Blackadder must be easily rated as one of the BBC's master productions. It's fun to watch, helps us learn, and perhaps even more, makes us think. But it is simply sheer comedic entertainment that begs for another season. Purchase all the seasons together in this single, remastered set. It will save you a few pounds from buying them one season at a time!",1274140800,12,5834,4.805776892430279

3947192,5,B002LFPAUM,"This is an excellent collection for anyone who enjoys 'Britcoms' and humor that requests a bit of thought.  Rowan Atkinson is obviously much more talented than even his Mr. Bean character shows.  If that is all you know of Atkinson, I recommend checking out this series.  You may even learn a bit of English history (well, pseudo-history at least).

The DVD extras are very good and add to the package rather than just fill disc space.  Tony Robinson's narration and all the interviews are excellent throughout.  Even though I first saw Hugh Laurie in Black Adder, I was still surprised to hear his native British accent in the inteviews - even more so since his interviews were done on the set of ""House"".

All in all a very well put together and thorough  compilation of one of the best British comedy series' ever.",1266969600,4,817,4.664335664335664

It follows the ""Black Addder"" family tree though various time periods.  He has a cadre of associates that accompny him as well as single series characters like the Prince of Wales, played by Hugh Laurie.

We laughed a lot, but it took us to the end of disk 1 to figure out that one must select ""Subtitles OFF"" to get the closed captioning to work.  Probably some sort of Brit humor that was lost on me.  Anyway....great product.  Wonderful to see the early work from Frye, Laurie and Atkinson.",1262476800,3,388,4.1891891891891895

Hugh Laurie and Stephen Frye are great in their recurring roles. All are done with great humor and great talent. I like all the episodes but particularly like the WWI episodes due to their underlying seriousness. These episodes present that war with it's stupidity clearly on display.

8372924,5,B002LFPAUM,""" I have a cunning plan....""  The cunning plan was remastering and re-issuing the Black Adder series. The series was great when we first saw it years ago and it just gets better with age, especially when regular TV is so dismal and politically preachy. (Get that Hollywood?) It's just easier to grab a movie and pop in a disk now instead. Black Adder is one of our favorites. Rowan Atkinson as the Black Adder and Tony Robinson as his mindless servant/sidekick Baldrick head an outstanding cast as they slug their way through British history. There were 4 main chapters in the series but this set also includes additional Black Adder specials; the entry ""Black Adder Back and Forth"" sends the Black Adder and Baldrick hurtling through time in a Time Machine with a surprising and smart ending. The remastered set is well done and looks even better upscaled on a 4K TV.  Six thumbs up!",1515456000,3,884,4.660256410256411
