7853822,5,6303872859,"...Jodorowsky disowned this film because they didn't let him touch the script. In other words, they didn't let him depict people taking dumps in the middle of the movie or vertically challenged actors running naked, like he usually does in his films. I guess it's a love/hate affair. From what he says in La Constellation Jodorowsky and the commentary to Fando & Lis, I figure this wasn't such a bad experience. I did not find it bad at all and the fact that you can watch it with the whole family or your overtly sensitive acquaintances for me is a plus. In my opinion, it plays on the same league as Adam's Apples, They Might Be Giants, King of Hearts and The Ninth Configuration. If you like any of those, this one is definitely worth a try... A lot of the great directors didn't write or tamper anyhow with the script so, I fail to see the what the problem is... THIS IS A FOREIGN REGION DISC, SO BETTER HAVE SOMETHING ENABLED TO PLAY IT ON...",1518480000,,947,4.386363636363637

7853827,3,6303872859,"This is the last film that Alejandro Jodorowsky finished.  Hopefully, it's not his last one, but it is a decent film and not nearly as bad as many have suggested it is.  Despite being a director for hire on this, there are still enough Jodorowsky visual touches here to make it worth seeing, especially for Jodorowsky fans.  O'Toole and Shariff are very good here, there are some great surreal touches in the film (especially a night scene at a carnival and the opening dinner scene), and overall it's very watchable and not boring.  It's a very hard film to find (the VHS copy is out of print, and there is no official DVD anywhere in the world), but if you're a Jodorowsky fan, you should find it.  It's not a great film, just an interesting, minor one.",1202601600,3,755,4.481751824817518
7853828,2,6303872859,"Well, it is a Jodorowsky film in name, but.... it's certainly not what his fans might expect.  Tame beyond belief. I think Alejandro was neutered before filming began.",1008806400,7,167,4.964285714285714
7853829,5,6303872859,I'm a hot fan of Omar Shariff. I/ve a pleasure to meet him during producing that film. It content a fantastic playing by a very good actors. I love you all and this film. The best wishes from Poland.,952473600,3,199,4.128205128205129
