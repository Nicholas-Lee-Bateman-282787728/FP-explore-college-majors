8322035,4,B000CGXLTY,"I had seen The Net with Sandra Bullock when it was first released (VHS?) and bought this set based on that. While The Net is an outstanding movie even though now a bit dated (look at the cell phones and 3.5 discs) imo, the Net 2.0 is not in the same league dropping the package a star. It would have been hard to attain the level of the original in any case. Maybe a second viewing will change my opinion, but for now the package is only worth buying because of the original, and in that respect, it is well worth buying.",1270425600,,521,4.117647058823529
