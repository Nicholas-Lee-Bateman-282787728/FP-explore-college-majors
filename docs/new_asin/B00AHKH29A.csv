5425365,5,B00AHKH29A,"For a first time yoggy, i really didn't know what to expect. Alot of the poses are easy, and Tara Styles makes manuvering from one pose to the next as simple as possible for a newbie. I will be purchasing more yoga workout dvd from these two..",1359936000,,243,4.191489361702128
5425366,4,B00AHKH29A,"This DVD is fantastic. I love the moves Tia and Tara do. Im new to yoga and I don't know the names of all the moves but what i do know is that i feel super streatched and my body feels so relaxed after the workout. its about 50 mins long but the time really flies by because your transitioning from one pose to the next and you feel better and better the further you get into the workout. my only complaint is that they tend to ""chit chat"" and giggle back and forth a lot and when your trying to focus and breathe and listen to the music and relax i have a hard time doing so because they are distracting me with the unecessary talking.",1359331200,10,636,4.015748031496063
5425367,4,B00AHKH29A,"This was my first time doing yoga. I really like the personal touch Mrs. Tia gave to the video. The yoga intructor was really calming, even her instruction was soft & calming. A bit long fit me, but definitely a good one for you yoggies.",1358812800,4,237,4.288888888888889
5425368,5,B00AHKH29A,"Finally a yoga dvd I can follow and do all the different poses with ease. Tia did a great job on this beginners dvd. My muscles were feeling relax after the work out and my mind was so free. The blood in my body were flowing and my thoughts were so  zen. I will keep working out every day with this video. It really calm you down and takes alot of stress of the body. The instructions are very easy to follow anybody can to it,so it does matter if you are 10 to 90, you can do it. If you thinking about buying it get it, you will not regret it.",1358121600,6,544,3.857142857142857

8551690,4,B00AHKH29A,"This is definitely a good video for beginners. The poses weren't too difficult and and you did feel loose and stretched after. However, I didn't really find it that ""calming"" compared to other relaxation yoga videos I've done. I kind of felt rushed and I also didn't like the small talk and the giggling, as another reviewer stated. It was kind of hard to get focused and get into the pose because they would switch to the next pose so quickly, but I have to admit it was a good workout and I did feel sore the next day!",1406678400,,520,4.262626262626263

I'm a huge fan of tia mowry so when I saw this DVD I felt the purchase was necessary. Tia and tamera always make sure their products are perfect so I can't wait to see how tia's dvd is. If its as great as I think I will be purchasing her other yoga DVD.",1363392000,2,394,3.9375
8551695,4,B00AHKH29A,"At first I loved this product, it calmed me down before bed and really helped me find a new passion for yoga! My only complaint is that the DVD is kind of long (almost an hour). I really do not have that kind of time to devote to working out as I go to school and work full time. The product came three weeks ahead of schedule and was brand new! Try it if your into yoga or just looking for something to relax your body and mind!",1360368000,2,429,3.8863636363636362
