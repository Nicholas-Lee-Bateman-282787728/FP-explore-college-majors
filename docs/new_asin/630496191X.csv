7881554,5,630496191X,"If you're a true St. Louis Cardinals fan, you'll have a hard time spending 90 minutes better than in watching this video. Narrated by Hall of Famer Jack Buck, the video chronicles the first 100 years of Cardinal baseball,  Hornsby to Ozzie, with 15 pennants and 9 world championships in between.  The most unforgettable moments are all here: Grover Alexander in the '26  Series, Dizzy and the Gashouse Gang, Slaughter's mad dash, Gibson's magical  1968, Brock's base-stealing records. Oh, and more than a little Stan the  Man! For younger fans, check out Ray Lankford knocking Phillie catcher  Darren Daulton out cold as he scores a game-winning run his rookie season.  A great, great trip down memory lane for Cardinal loyalists.",950054400,2,730,5.033333333333333
