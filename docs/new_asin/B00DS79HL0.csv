5852458,4,B00DS79HL0,"An emotional, rollercoaster compelling and sad but with a happy ending.  It's an embarrassing fact that people treated other humans like that in real life.  There is only one race, and it is our human race, so we need to try to and get along and respect others to have a better life.",1381190400,,283,4.320754716981132

This shameful and horrifying historical episode has been turned into a wonderfully thoughtful and touching movie. I'm amazed that the script-writers were able to turn this powerful book into an equally powerful movie.  And as the father of a 12-year old girl, I'm pleased that I can now introduce this shameful moment in American history to my daughter in a way that will move her and raise her consciousness without horrifying her in the way that the real incident horrified those of us who were young when it happened. Kudos to all involved with the project.",1381017600,11,734,6.048076923076923

5852462,5,B00DS79HL0,"This powerful, historical fiction takes place in 1963. The plot follows our protagonist Kenny (Bryce Clyde Jenkins) and his African American family from their house in Flint, Michigan to their family home in Birmingham, Alabama. While in Alabama, Kenny and his siblings are introduced to segregation and all its inhumanity.  In Michigan they lived free from sequestration except for what they experienced on TV. This film is seeded with real life situations and old black and white clips that are sewn together quite skillfully.

What I love about the film is the outstanding acting. The kids couldn't be better. The characters go through so much they're able to express a lot of emotion and does it show! I don't know if you've noticed, but there have been a lot of films about segregation this year; 42, Lee Daniels The Butler and more to come. What makes this film stand out is that the story is from 10-year-old Kenny's perspective. When we view the world through a black adult's eyes, we know they've probably experienced segregation. From a child's level, we see they can't comprehend why they're treated poorly because of their skin color. That's what makes it more powerful.

My favorite character is Kenny. I relate to him because he's sort of a nerd, kindhearted and in this film, confused. I like to see how he deals with the different situations he's placed in. Jenkins does a tremendous job portraying this character.

My favorite scene is when Kenny almost drowns. Kenny is swimming in the lake and gets sucked down into a whirlpool. Luckily, his brother Byron (Harrison Knight) saves him. This scene is intense and I got a little teary-eyed when Byron embraces Kenny and won't let go.

The moral is, ""You can't live your life in fear and live a good life."" After the drowning incident Kenny thinks the whirlpool (Whir Poo) is out to get him so he magnifies emotional situations to the point of over-whelming dread.

I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this for 9-year-olds and up. I think this film is very educational. It's a perfect film to show younger audiences and it has that family element to it that makes it entertaining.

5852463,5,B00DS79HL0,"We watched this after our 10-year-old read the book as part of school unit on civil rights and wanted to watch the movie.  He thought the movie hewed very closely to the book with only minor differences.  As a parent, I thought it was a very well done film that presents some very challenging topics in a way that is appropriate for kids ages 10 and up.",1522627200,,353,4.253731343283582
5852464,4,B00DS79HL0,"Not what I expected. It was so much more. I wanted a feel-good movie for the weekend and I sure got what I wanted. My daughter suggested this film since I was born and raised in Michigan. I thought The Watsons go to Birmingham was going to be a lot like College Road Trip with Donny Osmond, Martin Lawrence and Raven-Symon (a great movie on its own, but nothing like The Watsons go to Birmingham). In this motion picture, the trip itself was not the main focus, but the time that this family spent in the city of Birmingham. I was a little kid when much of the racial tension took place and had only heard about the bombings in Birmingham, but the stories all came back to me, things that I'd forgotten. I do not want to give spoilers away, but I was sobbing toward the end and felt great relief that miracles do happen despite evil intentions. (What kind of a monster would bomb a church? Why? That is the one place people are trying to become better citizens.) With all that happened decades ago, we should all embrace education and read what rights we do have in the Constitution. They were written for us all. The only parts of the movie that kept me waiting or wondering, were first, ""Hambone"". I kept expecting him to pop up on the street since he was part of a story at the beginning back in Flint. I thought I'd see his bumpy face and a big smile, but he never materialized. Second I thought that Mr. Robert's dog would have a bigger part in the movie. Would he run down the street after the children? Would he be cowering under the couch and in need of comfort? Would he lick the children's faces after a hot sweaty Alabama Summer night? Other than that, all the characters were like a woven cloth and it made a beautiful tapestry. One last thing: That little angel Joetta stole my heart. She will steal yours, too.",1522540800,,1824,4.33625730994152

The movie was good, but not nearly as good as the book. There was a lot left out (I understand how movie adaptations ofter differ) and it was oddly filmed at times - flipping from black and white to color in the same scene, for instance. The acting was mediocre and a bit cheesy in some instances. Overall, it was an OK film and still a fun way to end our unit.",1484784000,2,533,3.8545454545454545

5852567,4,B00DS79HL0,"Christopher Paul Curtis's children's novel of the same name was adapted to a film version with a top notch cast. The story of an African American family living in Flint, Michigan including three children; elder teenager Byron, middle son Kenny, and daughter Joanna. They are a working class family who have a home and a car. When the Watsons decide to spend the summer in Birmingham, Alabama, it's 1963 and on the verge of the Civil Rights movement. The Watsons never experienced the segregation up North until they went South. Birmingham is where the mother's family lives. They visit their grandmother and her friend, Mr. Robert (played by David Alan Grier).

Once in Birmingham, the Watson children learn about segregation and civil rights movement for African Americans. The diner scene is somewhat restrained from reality. Byron and Kenny go to the counter at a diner where they are not allow to serve them. There is the bombing of the church that is well done. The actual bombing in Birmingham, Alabama that killed four young girls is sensitively done and the film is dedicated in their memory of the four girls and the others who fought segregation.

This film would be perfect for schools especially since the book is found in the school and public libraries everywhere. Christopher Paul Curtis is a well known children's author. The novel and film of the same name should have been promoted more to the public. I didn't even know about a film adaptation until I purchased the DVD.

If there is one complaint, there are no special features to help explain the movie. They could have done a background and explanation of the church bombing that actually occurred. The making of the film would have been nice too. The film is perfect for young viewers since it is taken from Kenny's perspective.",1430956800,,1801,4.840909090909091

I previewed the video to make sure the content was suitable for fourth graders as there were words in the book we had to discuss before we started reading.  I was pleasantly surprised by the video in that there were no bad words.  The video differed in the book quite a bit because the focus was more on the Civil Rights Movement and less on the family dynamics and the desire the Watsons had to get their oldest son on the right path.  I was appreciative of the differences because they were both valuable lessons for my students and gave us opportunity for a lot of discussion and comparison.

I felt that the addition of the cousins involvement in the Civil Rights marches was unnecessary.  My sixth graders who read the book and then watched the movie were a little confused as to what was going on and why it was included since it wasn't in the book and didn't involve the Watson family.

My sons ages 9 and 11 found it an exciting read (they especially liked that it had curse words in it--don't worry parents, it was just the d-word and some slang) and enjoyed getting to know the characters. I loved the way the book engaged with the historical period in an age appropriate manner and did not shirk away from the dark realities of that time in American history. SPOILER ALERT In the story's climax, the Watson family comes into direct contact with the Birmingham church bombing. David Alan Grier has deftly balanced this encounter with harsh reality: he does not condescend to young readers nor does he make the story so dark that parents will find it inappropriate. I'm glad that I also read the book so that our family could talk about the literary aspects of the book (including some magical realism) and about America's history of racial segregation, the Civil Rights movement, the courageous people who moved our country towards racial equality, and the ways we can continue this work today.",1419811200,3,1121,4.753846153846154

5852606,4,B00DS79HL0,"I am surprised that some reviewers think the book is so much better than the film, since the book had, in my opinion, huge gaps in the story. For example, in the book, Byron, who is making a habit of getting into trouble and has zero respect for his parents, completely reforms on the very doorstep of his grandmother, with never a single word said again about him. Seriously, he says ""yes Ma'am"" and that is it. There is nothing at all about his or the family's experiences in Birmingham throughout the summer, or why he returned home with the family, when they had planned to have him spend the school year in Birmingham, or how or if his behavior changed. The book goes from the family's arrival in June, to the church bombing, to everyone, including Byron, back home in Michigan, in just that way.  The film indicates that the bombing was in September, not during the summer, which in the book is confusing, and that tragic event should have been made clear, and the film indicates why the family was still there in September, which is also confusing in the book, since the younger two should have been back in Michigan for school.  The book also contained far too much about the ""wool pooh,"" which to me made no sense to begin with.

I thought the film  made cohesive sense. You see how Byron starts to mature and think about something more important than himself. I liked the part where his cousins are talking about fighting for equality at the costs of being jailed and injured, and you see the light bulb start to go on in Byron's head. You see how prejudice and segregation affected the family, which is not at all present in the book. You see Byron's and Kenny's growth when they are back home.

The film is also gripping as it shows actual footage of the turmoil.

The things I didn't like about the film are, for one, the casting of Byron. Byron was 14 or 15 in the book. There was no way that Byron of the film was 15. He looked 20, and his friend older than that, and both looked menacing, especially when they were roughing Kenny up. They looked like adults beating a child up. It made no sense to me in book and film that Byron's parents would choose to take a troubled boy who wouldn't listen to anyone, already committing small crimes, and heading for bigger trouble, to the rabidly prejudiced South, where the slightest misstep could get him seriously hurt or killed. Emmett Till was only 14 when he was brutalized and murdered for allegedly just whistling at a white woman. The other thing was Mrs. Watson's trying to keep her kids in a protective bubble while putting them in a middle of a war, where not knowing what to do could get them hurt. That seemed kind of insane to me. By the same token, Byron saw the conflicts on tv, and should have known about the segregation.

 I absolutely feel that the film is excellent, and much better than the book. Though, however, the four little girls were mentioned in the dedication, but I wish there had been an accompanying feature on them and on the church bombing.",1409443200,,3032,4.470162748643761

I teach The Watsons in my English class and thought this adaptation was so true to form that it was a must purchase. It arrived just as we were finishing the book and as part of our capstone activity we compared the movie to the book. Even my students were impressed by how similar they really were. This is a great story about a terrible moment in history. I would encourage you to purchase as a family film, leads to discussions about the way things were, how far we've come, and how far we still need to go.",1393459200,,586,4.149122807017544

5852661,5,B00DS79HL0,this book I  have used in the classroom setting over the years.  this year we are going to show the video instead.

5852662,5,B00DS79HL0,"This is a very gentle version (without downplaying, easier for younger people to understand without extreme visual exposure to the huge violence) of what was happening during the civil rights movement during the Kennedy admin. and a bit beyond.  I think it is appropriate for ages 13 and older.  My daughter (15) had a lot of good questions and now has a much better idea what it was like during that time - something she has no concept of in her life today.  There is a lot of info. that younger kids just will not understand AND there are a couple of very intense scenes that my daughter would not have been okay after being exposed to at a younger age (she is very sensitive).",1391990400,,679,4.416
5852663,5,B00DS79HL0,I have been reading this with my classes for years. It's nice to see it brought to life and students can easily compare with the book.  Also a great way to use on a unit on Civil Rights.,1391644800,,186,3.8947368421052633
5852664,5,B00DS79HL0,We really enjoyed watching this movie even though we read the book and saw a theatre production of it. The screenplay and character selection was well done!,1391558400,,156,4.814814814814815
5852665,5,B00DS79HL0,I loved the movie!  I've read the book many times with different classes of students and was happily awaiting the release of the movie.  From the beginning of the movie I was hooked.  The events in the movie parallel the book and I really like that because it made the movie so easy to follow.  Good acting......good script........good movie!!!,1391299200,,344,4.779661016949152
5852666,4,B00DS79HL0,"It's obvious that the budget wasn't very big for this film, but it still was pretty good. I liked the casting, the acting, and the story. The characters were very believable, especially the father and mother.",1390089600,,208,4.805555555555555
5852667,5,B00DS79HL0,"I used the movie to point out the difference between a book and a movie based on a book and why the the script writer might make some of the changes they made.
The book and the movie are a very entertaining way to introduce and discuss a very difficult time in American history.",1389830400,,278,4.166666666666667
5852668,4,B00DS79HL0,My daughter read the book and loved it so she wanted us to see the movie too. This movie has a unique persective of a family that has been sheltered from many of the problems that African Americans faced in the South.,1389744000,,217,4.190476190476191
5852669,5,B00DS79HL0,"Don't be scared off by the PG rating on this movie.  Most kids see more violence and hear more bad language on network television than is in this movie.  The main episode of violence is at the end of the movie relating to the Birmingham church bombing in which 4 little Black girls were killed.

The characters are portrayed excellently by wonderful actors.  Even though I have read the book many times, the characters weren't that far off from how I had pictured them in my mind.  Most of the important events were included in the film, but remember some events had to be cut so the movie wouldn't last 6 hours.

I'm using the movie and the book with 3rd and 4th grade gifted and talented students to give background on the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and in conjunction with Black History Month.  It really gives a true picture of what blacks experienced back then.  Of course, I received parental permission from every student's parent prior to showing the movie.  Parents were given an opportunity to view the movie prior to giving permission because of the PG rating.",1389484800,20,1079,4.607329842931938
5852670,4,B00DS79HL0,I watched this movie with my 11 and 14 yr old girls and they enjoyed watching it and discussing the era of segregation in the south and how it would have impacted them had they lived in the south in 1963.  The acting was superb and the story line realistic and reflected how a family would be affected by the events in Birmingham in 1963.  My only disappointment with the movie is that I thought it could have been a little longer!,1389484800,4,431,4.2439024390243905
5852671,5,B00DS79HL0,Great movie and the movie site is easy to navigate. Will be using this again for our classroom. Thank you..,1389225600,,107,4.4
5852672,2,B00DS79HL0,"I feel as if this movie was rushed. The book was excellent and I couldn't wait for the movie. So much detail was left out of the movie and some characters from the book were just left out. I was just disappointed with the movie. If you read the book, you still should watch the movie just so you can do the compare and contrast.",1389139200,2,328,4.061538461538461

5852675,5,B00DS79HL0,"The book really met my expectations and the movie coupled the visual aspect of the reading for my students. I would highly recommend this movie as a supplement to any teaching material. It was grade appropriate and still hit the important highlights of the lesson from the reading.

Good movie, great acting and good actors to play the roles.",1388620800,3,342,4.796610169491525

5852677,5,B00DS79HL0,Hi I'm a 10 year old girl reading the book with my teacher back at school. And by the type of the book I think the movie will be amazing and funny even little Joey! I hope you give it a try and learn a little something about 1963 and how funny everyone is!,1386374400,3,256,3.759259259259259
5852678,5,B00DS79HL0,I loved the book and the movie does a wonderful job of integrating authentic news reports and the events of 1963 into the film.  I also thought  the addition of the cousins participating in the Children's March  added weight and credibility to the serious issues of racism and discrimination addressed in the story.,1386201600,,315,4.90566037735849
5852679,4,B00DS79HL0,"This was a good movie to show the history of African Americans back in slavery times.  I sat and watched it with my 8 year old son, based upon previous reviews.  He liked it, except for there were a couple of scary parts in the movie that I thought would not be appropriate for his age.  He was scared to go bed after watching.",1384128000,,327,4.078125
5852680,5,B00DS79HL0,"Years ago, my grandfather bought a meal for a black family who wanted to eat at a Walgreen's soda-fountain counter and was initially turned away by the racist woman who ran the place. My grandfather was a good customer and vowed never to do business there again if the manager wouldn't allow him to buy a meal for the family. He won and the family thanked him, nervously sat down and quickly finished their lunch, I am told.

This film is about the many injustices that blacks and other minorities faced in the South in the 1950s/1960s and what a few brave people did to change things for the better.

I very highly recommend ""The Watsons Go to Birmingham"" for ages 8 and up!",1384128000,,675,4.435483870967742

""Marching and getting your head Split open just to sit down next to him on a Toilet..flush him down with the rest of that stuff"" Malcom X LOL

With that out the way I'd Highly recommend this Movie for the simple fact of it's Positive portrayal of an entact, Functional Black Family with Well Spoken  Down to Earth FATHER and Mother raising their Three BEAUTIFUL children. The onslaught of Slave Movies, Negroe Bed Wenches and Disgusting Negative images of Black people in the Media..""The Watsons"" are like Fresh Clean Air and Sweet Water... A Movie you won't feel ashamed or nervous to watch with your sons and daughters. I love the fact that the Heart of the Movie focuses on FAMILY and not so much the Civil Rights movement--in fact there were a number of Black MEN in Birmingham ready to ""put in work"" and knew Exactly who was responsible for the Bombing.. They weren't running scared Victims.... Don't worry, we'll produce our CLASSIC Nat Turner Movie :)...but The Watsons remains ""Fairly Neutral"" for what it is.. which allows those in the Black community with more Progressive ideas and workable solutions to not have to work as hard to reprogram themselves and their children after watching this film.

I will be purchasing several copies of the DVD..I LOVE it that much and so does my Daughter.",1383782400,9,1653,4.63481228668942

In the movie, so much was left out that it felt disjointed and preachy.  The actors looked right for the roles, but that's about the best thing I can say for the movie.

It highlights some wonderful things and teaches parents you cant/shouldnt try to hide or protect your kids from problems in the world.
