The Gish sisters are spectacular, as are the supporting players, sets and costumes.

982402,5,6305186618,"This is indeed one of my favourites of the Gish sisters and the infamous and controversial D.W Griffith (known for his work in The Birth of a Nation, Broken Blossoms, Intolerance, Way Down East).

Lillian plays Henriette with such passion and her character searching for her beloved adopted sister Louise (played equally powerfully by Dorothy Gish) and her findings of love and being almost guillotined. It is truly seat clenchingly wonderful. I couldn't stop watching it and it remains my second favourite of D.W.'s films (Way Down East being the first).

982404,5,6305186618,"""Orphans of the Storm"" is the last great box-office success for direct D.W. Griffith and arguably the most melodramatic of his best films.  Set on the even of the French Revolution the titular characters are the fabled sisters Lillian and Dorothy Gish who have to endure all sorts of traumas as the bloody Reign of Terror consumes Paris.  Basically we have too parallel stories between which ""Orphans of the Storm"" moves back and forth.  On the one hand we have the plight of Henrietta (Lillian), the poor little peasant girl, and Louise (Dorothy), her blind ""sister,"" who was abandoned by her upper class mother.  On the other we have the growing discontent of the rabble with the aristocracy (""Poverty murmurs ominously outside the gates,"" as one title card puts it).  The two plot lines are put on a collision course when Henrietta falls in love with Chevalier de Vaudrey (Joseph Schildkraut), an aristocrat with a noble heart (he distributes bread to the starving masses).  Of course, this will matter little once the guillotine gets going.  But before that the key event takes place when the two sisters arrive in Paris so that Louise can undergo an operation that would restore her sight.  Henrietta is kidnapped because of her beauty by the lecherous Marquis de Praille (Morgan Wallace), and her blind sister is taken in by gypsies, at which point the melodrama is on in deadly earnest.
The Gish sisters are the stars of this film; their names do not appear in the opening credits; they are reserved for when the pair make their first appearance.  But this is really Lillian Gish's movie, even more so that Griffith's.  He provides the grand sets and human spectacle, especially once the revolution begins, not to mention the periodic denouncements of bolshevism, but the emotional moments all belong to Lillian, especially the scene when she hears her sister's voice for the first time since their separation.  As long as she is on screen you pay attention, but when the story goes back to the other plot threads slowly coming together your mind can start to wander, and it is her performance that makes the melodrama palatable.  After all, this is a film where her starving father goes to the church to abandon her and ends up bringing two babies home.  The close calls that almost reunite the two sisters are such that you could easily see this 1921 silent film being recut as a serial.
The special features for this Kino on Video DVD that is part of the Griffith Masterworks series includes a filmed introduction by Orson Welles; a portfolio of rare Griffith photographs of the directors and his starlets; ""Rescued From the Eagle's Nest,"" a 1908 film that stars Griffith as an actor; ""The Story of David Wark Griffith,"" a biography published in ""Photoplay"" magazine in 1916; footage taken at Griffith's funeral; and a radio eulogy of Griffith by fellow director Erich von Stroheim.  Based on Adolphe d'Ennery's play ""The Two Orphans,"" this film runs 150 minutes and features the 1922 score by Louis F. Gottschalk & William Frederick Peters given a modern arrangement and performed by Brian Benison.  ""Orphans of the Storm"" would not qualify as a great silent film, but Griffith's hand and Lillian Gish's performance is enough to ensure it is considered a classic.  I know that Mary Pickford was America's Sweetheart, but I find that hard to believe every time the camera lingers of Lillian Gish.",1060041600,5,3406,4.866782006920415
982405,5,6305186618,"This film shows Lillian Gish in one of her greatest roles, but is also noteworthy as an instance of one of the few readily available films in which she appears alongside her equally talented sister Dorothy. Dorothy was most famous as a comedienne, but shows her ability here as a dramatic actress especially in the way she portrays the fear and bewilderment of being alone, blind, in a hostile and unfamiliar world. It is also interesting to see a very early appearance of Joseph Schildkraut, who would go on to win an Oscar for his role in the Life of Emile Zola and much later would play Anne Frank's father in the Diary of Anne Frank. The scope of the film is enormous with lavish sets and costumes. This is remarkable for Griffith was in financial difficulties when the film was made, so much so that at times there were doubts as to whether he could finish it. Thankfully he did, for the film remains one of his best. The story is exciting and passionate with one of Griffith's best race to the rescue climaxes. Granted it has some clich's which were common to this genre, such as an orphan with an identifying locket, but these clich's are no worse than those of Dickens and Oliver Twist. Indeed Griffith portrays the French revolution as well as any adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities. Where he goes astray somewhat is in his attempts to liken the French Revolution to events and persons with which American audiences might have been more familiar. It is ludicrous to call Danton a French Abraham Lincoln and his comparisons with Bolshevism and warnings against the `red menace' come across now as mildly amusing. But these are really criticisms only of the titles which, as so often with Griffith, are sometimes overblown. This is a very good DVD for it shows the film in the most complete and, as far as I am aware, the longest version available. There is however, one brief scene of Danton arguing with a court which seems to repeat itself. Whether this was Griffith's intention or a restoration mistake I cannot say. The print shows very little damage and reproduces the film's original tints. The music is wonderful especially in scenes of the riotous dancing of the crowds. It is possible to quibble with the use of La Marseillaise, as this was written later than 1789, but this is a very minor point. To conclude I would highly recommend this film as a wonderful example of an historical epic and as one of the most exciting silent films I have ever seen.",983404800,22,2469,4.600907029478458
982406,5,6305186618,"David Wark Griffith's epic film has Lillian and Dorothy cruelly separated; Dorothy's blind and raised by thieves while Lillian's the innocent plundered by lecherous aristocrats. Half melodrama and half epic, this celebrated film has beautifully realised visual historical detail (the plot enters the French Revolution of 1789). The creaky situations, lavish settings and acting make it a dazzling, albeit overlong film.  Griffith captured the class injustice at the heart of this story by contrasting scenes of lavish parties at the houses of the nobles and the abject poverty of the beggars outside.  The thrilling use of crowds and meticulous historical accuracy make this epic comparable in scope and theme to BIRTH OF A NATION (which was Griffith's intent).  This 1921 silent masterpiece was originally 170 minutes long; the video is tinted with a film score.  Shot in Mamaroneck, New York.",958694400,,894,5.364285714285714
982567,5,6305186618,Orphans of the Storm proves to be one of Lillian Gish's finer performances  and working with her sister is an added bonus for anyone interested in watching an actress with command of her craft  and talents.  Griffith uses the background of the French Revolution to illustrate the hypocrisy of each economic class and the struggles of two sisters to reunite with each other.,1367107200,,373,4.888888888888889

982569,5,6305186618,"""Her name is Louise. Save Her.""

This is one of film pioneer D.W. Griffith's most rich and beautiful silent films. Griffith transformed A. D'Ennery's 19th century play into a mesmerizing and heartfelt epic which never lags, its stars and story holding the viewer's attention with its beauty and drama. The contrast of excess and poverty which brought about the French Revolution is told through the moving story of a blind orphan girl and the ""sister"" who sacrifices all to care for her. The casting of real sisters Lillian and Dorothy Gish in the parts of Louise and Henriette proved a fortunate one, both giving a sterling account of their talents.

Lushly photographed by Billy Bitzer, Griffith shows the ornate beauty of aristocratic life and how it was at odds with the tremendous poverty of the streets. His genius here, however, was using it simply as a backdrop to the more intimate story of Henriette (Lilian Gish) and her blind sister, Louise (Dorothy Gish). It made for a fast-moving and incredibly entertaining film, rather than some cerebral historical epic which looks great but can't hold your attention.

When the plague takes the lives of both their parents, Henriette vows to care for her blind sister Louise, abandoned on their doorstep as a baby. The two have grown up as sisters and it is that love which carries them through the storm about to engulf France. It is to Paris they travel in hopes of restoring Louise's sight, where Henriette's beauty does not go unnoticed. A crass aristocrat showing more concern for his horses than the poor young Parisian girl he runs over abducts Henriette, leaving the blind Louise on her own.

There is one aristocrat with a heart, however, and young Chevalier (Joseph Schildkraut) falls deeply in love with Henriette, offering a bethrothel ring. Though she loves the young man, she has promised not to marry without her sister's approval. While Chevalier tries to find Louise, Henriette befriends the voice of the downtrodden, Danton (Monte Blue). She hides him, only to find herself and find imprisoned, while Louise is at the mercy of street people. Louise is not without her protector either, however, even though it comes in the form of a cowardly street urchin named Pierre (Frank Puglia).

The shadow over Henriette's happiness darkens when fate finally brings the sisters together, only to allow them to be torn apart once again. Henriette is freed during the revoulution but is sentenced to the guillotine with Chevalier, who has returned to Paris, facing death to find her. Only an impassioned plea from Danton, a voice of reason in the midst of chaos can save the two lovers, as Louise looks on. But a desperate ride to get to the guillotine may not come in time.

Both Lillian and Dorothy Gish are wonderful here. Each have that dainty beauty which enabled them to play younger than they were. Those who doubt Lillian's physical appeal, however, will no longer do so after viewing this romantic historical epic. One scene in particular, as an umbrella clad Henriette braces the rain, offers ample evidence that a beautiful woman lurked just beneath her child-like beauty.

Creighton Hale and Lucille La Verne lend support, but this film truly belongs to the Gish sisters. This Alpha version is surprisingly good, with a fitting classical score accompanying the action. For the price, it is an excellent way to see this silent masterwork without spending a lot. The film itself is a dazzling spectacle, its mix of sentiment and heroics nearly unequaled in American cinema. A fantastic silent film which is as artistic as it is entertaining. A true American masterpiece.",1270080000,5,3639,4.9557377049180324
982570,5,6305186618,"Orphans of the storm is the touching black and white silent film about two young girls who become orphans shortly before the French Revolution. One of the girls is blind. After learning of a potential cure in Paris, the two attempt to travel there, but run afoul of an unscrupulous nobleman who kidnaps Henriette and Leaves Louise (the blind girl) in the streets to fend for herself.

Henriette finds herself taken to a debauched party where she is the center attraction. Louise is found by a kindly young man named Pierre, whose evil mother decides to exploit her as a beggar.

This film is quite lengthy and has several really touching moments. I particularly like the court scene, where Henriette begs the judge. The ending was also quite dramatic, particularly what Pierre does to save Henriette.

I'd recommend this film for fans of silent films. It was entertaining and really touching.",1255392000,,892,4.894039735099338
982571,5,6305186618,"This film is a mixture of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" and some other tales and stories that in America have always been accepted as the 'true' story of the Revolution in France. It follows on the known elements of the fable of the event rather than the facts

Most important to Griffith's vision is the convoluted tale of two sweet looking, perpetually innocent young sisters that travel to Paris from the country at the with the worst possible luck. Henriette (Lillian Guish) and the blind Louise (Dorothy Gish) are not technically sisters, Henriette's mother married a commoner against her aristocratic family's wishes and they killed him and gave her child away by placing it at the doors of Notre Dame in Paris on a snowy day. A peasant who was on his way to deposit his own girl at the steps was so moved by Louise's crying that he kept both. Louise had alongside a beautiful diamond-ringed locket, a small bag with enough gold coins to change the family's course from poverty to middle class. Then both parents  die suddenly of the plague and both girls decide to move to Paris.
On the road they are already victimized by a leering aristocrat who plots to have Henriette kidnapped. Henriette herself provided all the needed information in her conversation, while trying to keep him from wolfing her hands, neck or face with unsolicited kisssing and caressing. Of course Henriette is kidnapped right on arrival, Louise falls into the hands of a horrid beggar who uses her singing to extract more alms from passerbys. Eventually they will meet again, but this is the basic plot.

Griffith must have have had a very narrow and fantastical vision of pre-Revolutionary France, which comes through in the movie. This is the first movie I have ever seen where Danton, one of the radical and blood-thirsty leaders of the Jacobin faction of the Revolution is compared to Abraham Lincoln, surely this was a tremendous exaggeration to say the least. Danton's face, which has been preserved in numerous contemporary portraits and engravings is clearly that of a natural butcher, and the brutality of his personality is evident in every trait, leaving little doubt as to his capabilities in manipulating the mob through the Revolution, well documented from secondary sources,  from its beginnings in the cafe-clubs to the early stages of the Terror, where he himself perished in the scaffold.

Precisely because this Revolution was a noble cause, more than justified by the hardships of an undisputed majority of the French, we sympathize with it, however, it is also an undeniable fact that it quickly morphed into a nightmare, which demonstrated the unfortunate appearance of both mass executions and executions without trial from the beginning. These features only got worse with time, and the French Revolution has continued to challenge film directors up to our own time with the many problems in presenting a balanced picture of the events. The aristocrats as portrayed by Griffith, with the sole exception of the Chevalier de Vaudrey who falls in love with Henriette, are all poisonous vermin, and we can not wait till they get guillotined. They are either too busy trying to fit in a carriage while carrying a huge wiged coiffeure or running over street children on their way into town.

Almost completely absent from the screen is the strong presence of the financially powerful middle classes that had long ago supplanted the aristocracy as the richest people in the country and which were both the catalyst and 'raison d'etre' of the Revolution itself. Only Danton and Robespierre appear to be neither pauper or aristocrat, which leaves them in a twilight zone of identity up to the point when they become players in the revolt.  Griffith exaggerates further when he wants to show an exception: In another scene, so that we understand clearly that the Chevalier de Vaudrey is better than all the others, he finds a crowd of hungry people looking at bread in a window and goes in and buys everyone a loaf, but this is not enough; he proceeds to embrace and kiss a hideous looking woman, which is hard to believe, and then also gives her a bag of coins as a bonus.

Meanwhile it has been proven by both contemporary and older research that it was the financial help that France provided America through the ten long years from Independence Declaration in 1776 to the formation of a new Nation in 1787 that cracked the finances of the Old Regime, not the extravagance of the court or the follies of Marie Antoinette, although neither were insignificant in flaring the fires. No monument records this fact, no street or square bears his name, but it is nevertheless the truth as there was no parlament then, no assembly that 'voted' on this issue. It was the King and his cabinet who decided, at great cost, and as it turned out, disastrous consequences, to pursue this policy, not totally idealistic as it did carry the intention of checking England's power, but that nevertheless made possible the birth of America. Griffith chooses to forget that it was the absolute monarch, Luis XVI who consistently provided us with the funds to do our Independence, nothing indicating this important policy, which went on for years,  is shown. We only see him briefly in the movie, rather inate in the middle of his court, where he announces for example the marriage of the Chevalier.

In general the condensation process that Griffith uses to use the story of the sisters, can not give an accurate development of the Revolution. It merely excites our curiosity as to how they are going to cope with it. Although Jefferson and Franklin feature a brief, insignificant appearance without any connection to the action for further development, nothing is shown about he efforts of Grovernor Morris, our first ambassador in France, to bring here the King and the Royal family as he saw the country disintegrate into anarchy, and he correctly realized that we owed our Independcence to this man, and not solely to the antics of Lafayette, a man that in France proved to be less than the ideal founding father. This plan was unfortunately never realized, but it would have accelerated America's role in international politics by placing America into the very center of European power politics within less than a generation after the Declaration of Independence, quite a feat. On another, more important socio-cultural perspective, such a strong influence from France may well have toned down the puritanical aspects of the developing culture, and stimulated education and the political thoughts of  enlightenment that could have prevented the Civil War. Jefferson's correspondence at the time reveals an interesting penchant for denial in accepting the information provided by our American embassy, describing details of the massacres and brutality which was becoming commonplace. This is interesting from the perspective that an equally profound level of denial surely was a decisive factor a couple of generations later in the explosion of the Civil War over the issue of slavery, a subject that captured Griffith's imagination in another of his great films: ""Birth of a Nation"".

The cinematography is as usual with Griffith, wonderful to watch. The streets of Paris are an excellent effort to re-create the period, and the mob scenes particularly good at depicting the mix of carnage and carnival that characterized the early stages of the Revolution. The scenes in Versailles and the palaces of the aristocrats are adequately lavish, but it is very much better in the architecture and decor than the costumes, which  are sometimes very different from the originals, particularly in the choice of patterns. The scene where Danton rushes to save Henriette from the blade of the guillotine is full of inaccuracies, as for example the location of the guillottine, which was the Place de la Concorde and not 'somewhere outside the city gates"" . It does provide the drama and excitement of a modern car chase in an action movie, and it is also another version of  Griffith's desparate plot to save a prisioner from execution in his earlier film, ""Intolerance"".",1249862400,,8137,4.969140337986774
982572,5,6305186618,"This film is truly wonderful and enjoyable and it makes you appreciate the earlier works of DW Griffith even more.  DW grew with each film and the technical aspects become even more complex.  Dorothy and Lillian Gish are sisters who travel to Paris on the verge of the French Revolution to find a cure for Dorothy's blindness.  The women are woefully unprepared for the rough and tough Paris and both get lost into the city in different ways.  Lillian gets caught up with aristocrats and Dorothy ends up with some very shady low life characters.  As both struggle to get back together and survive the revolution.  Did I mention that the two sisters aren't really sisters?  Orson Welles has a great introduction to the film that shouldn't be missed.  He is good at explaining DW Griffith's attachment to 19th century theatre and makes the case for forgiving that aspect of Griffith.  This was Griffith's last major success, probably because the acting style he desired was becoming less popular and common in films.  There is also a collection of rare photographs of Griffith and a 1908 film which Griffith acted in.  The extras are well worth watching.",1230422400,,1152,4.826530612244898
982573,5,6305186618,"Modern opinion ranks D. W. Griffith's ORPHANS OF THE STORM well below his INTOLERANCE and THE BIRTH OF A NATION, even though this film was widely considered Griffith's --best-- work at the time of its release. That initial assessment is quite justified: Griffith's multi-layered melodrama of two sisters that plays out against the chaos of the French Revolution is masterfully realized.

""Orphans"" had effects that reached far beyond the emotions of moviegoers in 1921. This film was one that inspired Serge Eisenstein's experiments in rapid editing. By comparison though, Serge's eventual style seems mechanical and a weak imitation of Griffith's brilliantly instinctive use of the fast cut. Also, the later sound-era version of A TALE OF TWO CITIES (with Ronald Colman) practically steals entire sequences from this older work.

ORPHANS OF THE STORM is clearly the culmination of over two decades of focused directing experience, and it's equal to or better than any single David Wark Griffith movie. Highest recommendation!

(8.3) Orphans of the Storm (""The Two Orphans"") (silent-1921) - Lillian Gish/Dorothy Gish/Joseph Schildkraut/Frank Losee (minor roles: Monte Blue/Kenny Delmar)

""ORPHANS"" TRIVIA--

This was Lillian Gish's last appearance in a Griffith film.

The Gish sisters were directly related to Pres. Zachary Taylor.

Joseph Schildkraut (the Chevalier) was the first non-American to win an Oscar: Best Supporting Actor - THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA (1937).

Kenny Delmar, who plays the Chevalier as a boy, was the voice of Senator Claghorn on the ""Allen's Alley"" segment of Fred Allen's radio show.

Despite D. W.'s denials, a strong hatred of Bolshevism partly influenced his depiction here of the French Revolution.

In all his shorts, ""programmers"" and epic masterpieces, Griiffith NEVER used a script! Each day, he'd decide what to shoot and explained scenes and action to actors as they went along.",1218067200,,2274,5.816265060240964
982574,4,6305186618,"By 1921, ""the Father of Film"" D.W. Griffith was well on his way to setting the standard for Hollywood epics with all the main ingredients:  emotional drama and tragedy, romance, political intrigues, moral injustices and the essential thrilling climax to keep you on the edge of your seat.  In fact, Griffith had set the benchmark several years earlier with grand epics such as ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""Intolerance"", and like these, ""Orphans of the Storm"" is also a fast-paced drama packed with action and emotion, as well as conveying an important message, which Griffith had always done since his early short films from 1908 onwards.  Like these fascinating short films, such as for Biograph in those early years which always carried some kind of social or moral message, the point Griffith wanted to make in ""Orphans of the Storm"" is of the destructive elements which lead to bad governments, anarchy and revolution, such as in France where this story takes place, but also the Russian Revolution of 1917, which apparently inspired Griffith to use this theme.  He also made the point that we, living in peaceful countries, should be glad and grateful for our good governments.  Soapbox speeches aside, Griffith was also a master storyteller and could balance all elements of an entertaining but also meaningful film, and ""Orphans of the Storm"" is a good example.  From the very start, the audience is drawn into pity and empathy for the two orphan girls, one of whom becomes blind and is lovingly cared for by the other.  Lillian and Dorothy Gish are perfectly cast in these roles, and once their path leads straight into the debauchery of French aristocrats, peasants and revolutionists, and they become separated and lost, the suspense continually escalates up to the grand climax.  With so many events and scenes, the viewer has to stay reasonably alert to follow the story and become familiar with the many varied characters in this film, but the effort is rewarding.  There is not a single dull moment in the entire two hours of ""Orphans of the Storm"", and while following the fast action, one cannot fail to notice that a lot of effort was put into sets and costumes to recreate Paris at the time of the French Revolution.  Although this DVD is by the budget-priced label, Alpha Video, the picture quality is very good in this case, and only the accompanying music is at a lower standard than most other labels such as Kino Video and Image Entertainment.  The score is orchestral classical music, and while it was not composed for this film, it is actually still quite suitable and fits the atmosphere of the period.  For a budget-priced version of this Griffith epic, this DVD is not too bad at all.",1175040000,3,2708,4.825053995680346
982575,5,6305186618,"ORPHANS OF THE STORM is a great movie, and this time I'm not going to deduct a point for print quality and its non-sequiter of a sound track.
  Real sisters Lillian and Dorothy Gish star as half-sisters Henriette and Louise Girard.  Louise (Dorothy) was found on the cold and snowy steps of the church Henriette's father had, before a change of heart, placed her.  Their parents die, the girls grow into porcelain beauties and Louise loses her sight.  Henriette vows to take care of Louise forever, and they travel to Paris in hopes of restoring Louise's sight.
  En route a cruel aristocrat is inflamed with Henriette's ""virginal beauty"" and connives to kidnap her.  Henriette is indeed kidnapped shortly after her arrival in Paris, and the helpless Louise is forced to fend for herself.
 Half of the fun of ORPHANS OF THE STORM is watching the indignities DW Griffith subjects his two starlets to.  Henriette is kidnapped by one of the slimier specimens of the over-fed and over-sexed aristocracy.  Her desperate search for Louise is frustrated at every turn- when she finally spots Louise and attempts to reach her the police arrive and she is sent to a prison for fallen women.  Oh, yeah, did I mention her delivery to ""the foot of Death's gate?""
 Louise has it no better.  She is kidnapped by the monstrous Mother Frochard (Lucille La Verne).  Mother Frochard, with her hair mole and moustache and missing teeth, may be the ugliest woman ever filmed.  Mother F is a street beggar, and she plans to use the blind Louise as her main attraction.  After she breaks Louise's spirit, that is.  So, down into the rat-infested cellar with Louise and up comes the ladder.  They're real rats down there.  Griffith also throws a few cold days of beggary and an attempted rape in Louise's direction.
 It's all great fun and the girls are indomitably strong and resourceful.  The print quality is quite good in spots, simply awful in others.  Most of the stock is sepia-toned, but some battle scenes seem to have been tinted red and there's a scene towards the end of the movie that seems to have been colorized.  Because this isn't a restored print it's impossible to tell.
 Having watched a handful of silent movies recently I'm beginning to wonder why they aren't rescored.  Alpha Video puts a classical recording on the track of their releases and calls it good.  It's not.  These old films are works of art and national treasures, and they deserve better than this.  Sound IS an important component to movies.  Either restore the original music or have a contemporary composer write a brand new score.  (Note: I watched the discount Alpha release of the film, and I didn't realize that Kino has a pricier print that includes the original music.  I'm going out on a ledge here, but I'll bet the print quality is better, too.  I'll be trading up to the Kino version in the near future.)",1083974400,23,2881,4.720883534136546
982576,4,6305186618,"This is one of those early films that kept me checking the date of production.  This is impressive stuff coming so early in the history of American cinema.  From the lush costumes and sets to the use of thousands of extras, this reminds us how ground-breaking some of Griffith's work truly was.
Sure, it's campy melodrama, the sets are stagey, and cinematography had not yet matured beyond wide-shot vs. close-up, but for its time, ""Orphans of the Storm"" is full of moving characterizations and real drama.  Like Griffith's other great works, ""Orphans"" is over-long but it must have been an expectation in the day for a ""serious"" film.
The Gish sisters are great fun to watch, as are the young male stars, Schildkraut and Puglia.  I LOVE Lucille La Verne's performance as the ""scoundrel"" Mother Frochard.  You have to love the mustache!
Yes, watch this film for the impressive work by Griffith in this EARLY period piece, but it also serves as a time-capsule to a by-gone era in American cultural history.  While not as obvious or heavy-handed as ""Birth of a Nation,"" the political leanings that underscore ""Orphans of the Storm"" are not subtly hidden but are on full display.",1075939200,2,1176,4.825870646766169

As for the movie itself, be warned that it is an anti-Communist propaganda film and a rather lengthy silent film (though hardly the longest).  Through the faults that, let's be honest, all D. W. Griffith's movies contained (as in the archaic politics/stereotypes of his time), the story is actually pretty entertaining.  The French Revolution setting is exciting and, say what you will about his personal views, Griffith was beyond influential in cinema and directing for a reason.  Overall, as long as you are able to shrug off the propaganda (I can't think of any outright stereotyping in this film so that's a plus) this is a fabulous piece of storytelling.",1420329600,,743,4.928
