3658344,5,B001JL96LI,"You get the Nelson for eight episodes and I love it!  Bringing back old movies are a thing that needs more looking into for our old folks who remember and the young ones who need to know.  It is a way to compare life in the past lane to the fast lane.  A real keeper. Check out little Rick, ""Yeah, boy.""",1353196800,11,303,3.9344262295081966

3658346,3,B001JL96LI,"My major frustration with this DVD is that there are only 4 episodes picked at random from the 14 years of ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.""  If I were you, I'd check into the complete series.  Sam Nelson (Ricky Nelson's son) is actually raising money (from now until Nov. 3, 2011) to restore the entire 435-episode series of ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" and include the original commercials too! He hopes to have the entire series restored by the time ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" is inducted into the Smithsonian.",1319500800,,538,4.774193548387097

3658350,5,B001JL96LI,"I had never seen any episodes of OZZIE & HARRIET until I saw the CHRISTMAS EPISODES: ""A BUSY CHRISTMAS"", and ""A LATE CHRISTMAS"" They are on  a five episodes collection called: ""THE CHRISTMAS TV EPISODES"", which also include an episode from THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, & two episodes from THE JACK BENNY SHOW. Anyone who is a fan of OZZIE & HARRIET would enjoy having all of the CHRISTMAS EPISODES in this one collection. They are such a delight to watch and they are so funny. Unfortunately they are not listed on the liner in the order in which they appear on the disc. And they are not in the order in which they were shown on TV, either.

On the liner, the episodes are listed this way:
1. ""Boy's Christmas Money""
2. ""Day After Christmas""
3. ""Girl In The Emporium""
4. ""The Fruitcake""
5. ""The Miracle""
6. ""Christmas Tree Lot""
7. ""A Busy Christmas""
8. ""A Late Christmas""

Below is the order in which the episodes actually appear on this DVD:
1. ""Boy's Christmas Money""
2. ""A Busy Christmas""
3. ""Christmas Tree Lot""
4. ""Day After Christmas""
5. ""Girl In The Emporium""
6. ""A Late Christmas""
7. ""The Fruitcake""
8. ""The Miracle""

When the show was in production, the episodes aired in this order:
1. ""The Boy's Christmas Money"" - December 19, 1952
2. ""Late Christmas Gift"" - December 26, 1952
3. ""The Miracle"" - December 25, 1953
4. ""The Fruitcake"" - January 07, 1955
5. ""A Busy Christmas - December 19, 1956
6. ""The Day After Christmas"" - December 26, 1956
7. ""The Christmas Tree Lot"" - December 18, 1957
8. ""Girl In The Emporium"" - December 14, 1960

I wish they had been placed on the DVD the way they first aired on TV. If they had, we would have seen the growth of the boys. And the later Christmas Episodes were better, I think. I may be a little prejudice here because they are also my favorites, from ""A Busy Christmas"" to ""Girl In The  Emporium. And I'm in love with ""Wally Plumstead"". He was so funny.

The following are my interpretations of each episode:
1. ""Boy's Christmas Money"" - David and Ricky want to earn money to buy Christmas Presents. Ozzie And Harriet try to help them without each  other's knowledge, but they wind up finding their own jobs.
2. ""Day After Christmas"" - David and Ricky's reminiscing about the day after Christmas, makes Ozzie think that they want to spend some time up  at the lake.
3. ""Girl In The Emporium"" - After Ricky and Wally Christmas Shop at The Emporium, and meet ""Terry"", the Salesgirl, they both apply for a job in the same department that she works in. This was the second and last Christmas Episode in which Wally (Skip Young) appears in.
4. ""The Fruitcake"" - Ozzie gets upset that Thorny shows no imagination beyond giving him Fruitcakes for Christmas.
5. ""The Miracle"" - David and Ricky want it to snow for Christmas so that they could go Skiing.
6. ""Christmas Tree Lot"" - David and Ricky need to make money to buy Christmas Presents, so their friend Wally suggest that they sell Christmas Trees. This was the first Christmas Episode in which Wally (Skip Young) appears in.
7. ""A Busy Christmas"" - Ozzie becomes a Mr. Scrooge when he's asked to do more and more Christmas Duties.
8. ""A Late Christmas"" - A missing Christmas Gift at the ""Nelsons"" allows them to bring some Christmas Joy to a less fortunate family.

This show had Fourteen Seasons. I often wonder how come when a show run for awhile, why doesn't every season have a Christmas Episode?  I think too that Wally should have appeared in at least one more Christmas Episode. I think he could have appeared in: ""Day After Christmas"", placing him in the Skating Rink Scene and the Campfire Scene, easily.

There is another Ozzie & Harriet Christmas compilation availabe, but it only has four epiodes. But this compilation is complete, as far as I know. Though there does seem to be some confusion with the Christmas Episode: ""A Late Christmas"". I have seen it titled as ""A Late Christmas Gift"" and ""The Lost Christmas Gift"". And another Christmas Episode that I feel was mistitled is ""Girl In The Emporium"". How about something that may have made more sense for the episode, like: ""Rick And The Salesgirl"" or ""Rick's Christmas Crush"".

I think this collection was/is well worth my money. Though l already had two of the episodes that are on this disc, it is still worth the near six dollars that I paid for it. It even contains commercials from the episodes. I have tons of Christmas Movies and other episode. But I find myself watching this entire DVD over and over. I am a forever devoted fan of ""The Adventures Of Ozzie & Harriet"" no matter what episode I'm watching.",1449878400,9,4578,4.554744525547445

May new Christmas episodes I have never seen before, especially ""The Fruitcake"" and ""The Miracle"", the latter of which is a touching reminiscent view of Ozzie's Dad or Grandfather and the rest of the actors playing similar part dressed in Victorian garb; a hoot to say the least!",1424131200,,348,5.105263157894737

I find this show to be heartwarming & wonderfully refreshing, especially compared to today's trashy tv! Hope to purchase more episodes of this show if they ever come out with them all in chronological order. The quality of the picture is not the greatest, not sure if it's just because it's an old show or what. Regardless, it was still very enjoyable!",1422316800,3,502,4.467391304347826
