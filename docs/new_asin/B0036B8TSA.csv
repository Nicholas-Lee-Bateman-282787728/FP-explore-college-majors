8389759,1,B0036B8TSA,"This film fraudulently, misrepresents itself as a film of the Amish. It is not filmed on location on Amish farms, nor in Amish homes, nor in Amish businesses. It does not interview any Schwarzentruber Amish or distinguish them in any way.

Some non-Amish, guy with a cheap video-camera stepped-out into his backyard, and video-taped himself rambling incoherently about politics; and gave his video a false title. Later he interviews other non-Amish, people; a guy beside the road; a woman in an office; and is it boring! Later the same guy puts on a wig and fake beard and dresses Amish to quietly mock viewers.

I have seen five other films about the Amish, and this home-video is nothing like them.

The video's-maker falsely-advertises this as an Amish film; false-advertising is illegal. The maker of this youtube home-video is going to cost Amazon time and money responding to irate customers. Amazon should sue him.",1352332800,21,921,5.006535947712418
