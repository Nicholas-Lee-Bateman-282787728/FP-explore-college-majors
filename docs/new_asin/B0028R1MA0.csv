8356909,5,B0028R1MA0,"Juan Gabriel as a ""Mexican Chicano"" ... classic! From seeing Pachuco ghosts in the alley, to riding to UCLA Urban Planning class (chain steering wheel y todo!) where the Xicano/Mexicano students are initially (classically) ""in the shadows,"" to awkwardly dating westside white girl, to the inescapable barrio problems haunting him, this movie is a cool Chicano film from the Mexican p.o.v.. Recommended by Beto (CSUN/ucla) favorite parts are the community organizer trying to save brother ""el Johnny,"" classroom discussions, the Raza noche de cultura fundraiser featuring Lucha Villa, but my favorite for some reason is the closing Varrio Waltz where crooner/JG comes back to his roots ""al otro lado del LA bridge"" to get his Chicano swag on (pre-""Tu estas Siempre en Mi Mente"").",1354838400,,778,5.282258064516129
