2739057,3,B000MQCUD2,"This movie is far from perfect. As one reviewer stated, there were many interviews with great personalities, but not much of this is shared with us in the film. However, it is a fascinating portrait of humankind, and I did enjoy the artistic aspects very much.

The ""thought that counts"" is that the creators have the intention to help us humans join together in saving the world and saving ourselves. There is a personal touch to this movie that makes it somehow more down-to-earth than more commercial and polished films like The Secret and What the Bleep. The creators of the film really create a sense that humankind is one big family, and we're all ""in this together"", with all of our quirks and imperfections. We need to learn how to live in harmony, and some people who see this film actually get this core message, and we need this message now more than ever before in human history. As the woman says in the extras, we humans are incredibly beautiful. Let us express that now. We NEED TO express that now.",1189641600,11,1014,4.571428571428571
2739058,5,B000MQCUD2,"ONE is just another movie. Yet it tells the story of REAL people; that makes all the difference.

ONE: The Movie shares an energizing story about a family who decides to follow a nudge from within and ask the big questions of life about peace and war, life and death, the meaning of it all. However, the filmmakers and audience discover that it is not about finding the answers, but meeting the people who believe in them. ONE: The Movie is about relationships.

Some reviews I've read have dwelled upon feelings that interviews of individual spiritual leaders were ""truncated,"" and disconnected. But complete interviews of individuals' perspectives is not the point. ONE is not about any one person, but about the community of many who speak with voices and similarity and difference.

ONE: The Movie challenges us to live our lives truly, to love fully. Watch ONE with a friend or family member. Feel the power of living and loving from your core.",1187568000,7,949,4.809815950920245
2739059,5,B000MQCUD2,"Albeit, not a blockbuster production number with explosions and half naked girls, filmed with helicopters and cool visual effects... if you've read this far, those things just might not be your selling point anyway.

This film is one of the more powerful movies I've ever bought.
If you thought ""the Secret"" was a valuable lesson in connection to the self and materializing your wishes, this film will fill the blanks ""the Secret"" left out..
""One the Movie"" sends us on a journey of connection to the ""other"", to each other and to that, that some might call God or ""source"" or one of many other names..

Filled with interviews of many of the worlds most ""connected"" people, like Buddhist Peacemaker, Thich Nhat Hahn, Dr. Robert Thurman and Deepak Chopra, we learn from masters of a broad and varied array of disciplines and religions about what it is that connects us all together.
This, in a time when our media and Politicians are constantly drumming up new ways to make us feel incomplete and separate from each other.
That is exactly what makes this a film profound adventure.

Surprisingly, some of the most impactful insights come from average people that the film makers meet along their way.

So, If you have grown past the ""with us or against us"" mentality, and long for further investigation on what makes us tick and are trying to empathize with, understand and engage your fellow man, or even yourself,
BUY THIS FILM!",1187481600,13,1429,4.77327935222672
2739060,1,B000MQCUD2,"This film has very little to do with being ""one.""  The interviews are fascinating, but the filmmaking is terrible.",1187308800,15,114,5.0
2739061,5,B000MQCUD2,"This film is unique and very honest.  I have shared it and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peaceful-Warrior-Widescreen/dp/B000QEIOSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peaceful Warrior (Widescreen)</a>"" many times with friends.  I have had very positive appreciation of both with stimulated conversation that followed.

The honesty of the movie was demonstrated by the young man on the street with the director's integrity of including his powerful feelings in the movie.

Each quest that came to the film was unique, yet with very little exception were all one about being the best humans; humans with a unique beauty in our soul.

What may be confusing about being ""one"", is that so many in the world have forgotten we are one human race : - (

Hopefully, ""One the Movie"" will be a reminder for all of us that want reminded that we are ONE. As we are ONE ""We are all unique. That is what is beautiful about us."" - ONE the Movie.",1185321600,7,1738,7.703517587939698
2739062,5,B000MQCUD2,"sorry to all you who wrote bad reviews.  I found it insightful leaving me with lots of questions of my own to explore and discover. It gives you just enough from each person to understand their ideas.

I have watched it 3 times now and get something out of each viewing.

The fact that they are amateurs reminds me that I too can do anything I set my mind to.  I have recently left the business ""world"" to explore my dreams and this movie helps to remind me that I too can do what my soul needs and desires if I put my heart into it.

Thank you guys for making this movie, I find it inspiring!!!",1324252800,2,595,4.051282051282051
2739063,1,B000MQCUD2,"The film was made by amateurs and ufortunately it shows. Besides, they annoyingly keep repeating it (we are not professionals)throughout the film as if trying to appologize for the fact.
After the great success of ""What the bleep do we know?"" a lot of professionals! tried to follow the suit. Understandably, because it's an interesting topic: the unity of the universe, our place in it etc. But the copy is always bleeker than the original. The makers of ONE even tried to incorporate the story of some dude in a hotel (just like In ""What the bleep.."" there's the story of Amanda the photographer, I guess) but I just don't get it. What's he doing there?
I also agree that the film doesn't prove the point of oneness at all, quite the opposite actually.
One star for successfully recruiting all those great personalities to participate in the project.",1313625600,5,852,4.763513513513513
2739064,3,B000MQCUD2,The film was over all a good first attempt at film making. It was however disappointing that the questions were never presented in their entirety. So it was not what I expected..I was hoping for more.,1308614400,4,200,4.583333333333333
2739065,2,B000MQCUD2,"This movie had a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, it includes a lot of meaningless transitions inserted for some 'artistic' value.  It is extremely disappointing to spend so much time looking at nothing when you could be listening to the priceless wisdom of the spiritual leaders that they interviewed.  They asked 20 questions during the interview, and gave you the answers from a few of the people for SOME of the questions.  Not even all the questions are covered.  Not to worry, however, you can purchase each interview separately on their website for ONLY 9.95 each. This information should have been covered in the movie.

There are some very insightful answers given by many people, but too many transitions where there should be valid content.",1292371200,3,752,5.024193548387097
2739066,2,B000MQCUD2,"Keep in mind as you read this that I am a huge supporter of this kind of film making.

I bought this film looking forward to some interesting interviews with people I appreciate and admire on a subject I feel has tremendous importance . But ""ONE: the movie"" turned out to be one long commercial/teaser for a series of interviews that were available for purchase if I were so inclined. ???. I thought I had already done that! Where are the interviews? I had to watch it twice to see if I missed something. I didn't. Not one full length interview in the whole film. Big sigh.

Hats off to the first time film makers for good camera work and for picking an interesting subject. They just didn't deliver the subject they had me believing I would receive in this particular film. I would have liked to have known this prior to purchase.

The idea is inspiring, but the film does NOT deliver.

There is an ever growing trend in the consciousness raising community of offering bread crumbs of information as a way of cashing in a little at a time with subsequent books and DVD's and CD's and workshops and on and on. This movie, sad to say, falls in this category for me. At a time when the raising of consciousness on our shared little planet is of tremendous importance I hope this trend soon changes.",1264291200,31,1296,4.432773109243698
2739067,5,B000MQCUD2,"I also agree with one of the reviewers about some of the unfair ratings.  This film was done by a couple of guys who had never done anything like this in their lives and were still reading the instruction manual on the equipment during filming.  I think that is precisely what adds to it's authenticity and vulnerability.  The point is the message.  I wouldn't say it was incoherent by any stretch. I have a hard time understanding what was so laughable (see review above) about the idea of ""oneness"" as the word 'religion' denotes and how that is the common thread with most systems of beliefs. I think the only akwardness was with the black and white sequences.  I felt that made it a little choppy. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it and was moved.",1236556800,2,747,4.544776119402985
2739068,5,B000MQCUD2,"This movie is not about a particular viewpoint, it is more of an interview style documentary of many world views, religions (including atheists), and random people on the streets. Great idea, inspiring production, and a beautiful message. I highly recommend this spiritually tantalizing masterpiece.",1235088000,5,299,5.818181818181818
2739069,5,B000MQCUD2,"A very important point here is that this is an amateur film created by someone with passion and a videocam. To expect professional quality on such a budget is, well...pretty unrealistic. It is silly to take this as a personal affront. Too bad that some people who might normally be open to the central message miss the big picture. The big picture is what we need to focus on now. There seems to be a universal need to kill the messenger. I don't think this is helpful. Why help others divide us further?
If I had made such a movie with what resources this couple had available to them I'd be pretty darn proud. The thoughtful reviews here give the tone of what it's about. Throw your expectations out the window and see what IS THERE. You either get it or you don't. I get it, and want more like this...
Leonardo DiCapprio created a movie with a much bigger budget called ""The 11th Hour"" and it didn't do well. Why? Who knows...probably apathy, that's the ""devil's"" best friend. Let's support the message wherever we can. THAT""S THE MESSAGE! Celebrate Pangea Day May 10,wherever you are. Tune in and pass the inspiration :)",1208304000,11,1124,4.541871921182266
2739070,5,B000MQCUD2,"Being a healer and a spiritual advisor for the past 6 years, I have to suggest getting this DVD for your collection.  I've read some of the negative reviews and decided to see for myself about this.  I'm not sure what the other people that reviewed this had expected to see, but there are some very prominent spiritual people (leaders) in this giving their opinion on the subject of ""oneness"".  What I think some of these reviewers do not understand is that to actually get an audience with some of these individuals and to have these questions answered is not an easy task, However the makers of this movie did a great job in doing just that. For anyone on a spiritual journey, this is a nice uplifting collection of interviews to help ponder what life means to you. This movie should be considered in the same respect as ""The Secret"" and ""What the Bleep?"".",1201046400,27,858,4.52258064516129
2739071,1,B000MQCUD2,"Havin read all the reviews for this movie, I decided to take a chance.  I'm very sorry that I purchased this movie.  The interviews are interesting, and Robert Thurmann is wonderful, as usaul, as is Thomas Keating.  However, the quality of this movie is terrible.  I understand that the filmmakers are amatures, but that said, maybe they should leave filmmaking to the professionals.  I would much rather watch ""What the Bleep"" or ""Peaceful Warrior.""  Some people will support this movie because they believe in it's message, as do I.  However, it's hard to enjoy the spirituality in this film when the quality is so poor.  Also, the idea of being ""one"" is suddenly dropped in at the end of the film, as if the ""filmmakers"" realized that they had no story.",1198281600,21,756,4.717557251908397

How would the great spiritual leaders of the world answer these questions?

How would a homeless young person answer these questions?

What is the essence of humanity?  What unites humanity?

This is not just a film.  This is a project.  You can submit your own answers to these questions in the ""Community"" section of the ""onetheproject"" web site.

This is also a remarkable film.  A couple of friends & relatives, who did not even know how to work a camera, created a major production with a large number of the top names in the spiritual community.  This film, a four-year project, was apparently meant to happen, because is came off successfully with strong encouragement from some of the worlds greatest spiritual leaders.

In addition to the interviews, there is a powerful cinematic thread that follows the almost silent protagonist throughout his journey. I could not imagine a professional film company doing a better job of this portrayal.

Some reviewers complained that the complete interviews, as audio CDs,  were extra cost items, and that the DVD only contained a sampling of the interviews.  From my perspective, the DVD fulfilled its goal -- to provide a cross-section of understandings framed by these questions, across spiritual leaders and humanity in general.  In order to come up with a DVD of reasonable length, much editing was required.  The audio CDs of complete interviews, and the 50-page Conversation Guide, were added later, to supplement the DVD for those who wanted them.",1329523200,4,2476,4.72093023255814
