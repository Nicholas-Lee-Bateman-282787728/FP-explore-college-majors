8383204,5,B002WK0GK0,"When I first got this video I thought it would be mostly going through covered bridges which I was very interested in but wanted to see some of Oregon countryside too. I'm happy to say it is what I got. If you've ever been to Oregon you know it is really pretty all year long. I think this video is a good representation of some of the best scenic rides in Oregon plus you see some history when you come across one of the covered bridges.
I recommend this video to indoor cyclists. It helps pass the time in a wonderful way.",1343347200,2,524,4.147058823529412
