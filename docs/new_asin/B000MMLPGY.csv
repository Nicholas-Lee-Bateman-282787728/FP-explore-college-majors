8170029,2,B000MMLPGY,"I don't know where they got this soprano? Yikes! The voice sounded like a soprano well past her prime. Off key most of the time with an ugly sound. The tenor is OK. The baritone questionable. The production looked like community theater on a budget and the ballet was monotonous.
Stick with the Scotto recording and call it a day.",1518220800,,330,4.516666666666667
8170030,3,B000MMLPGY,"'Le Villi' is of historic interest as Puccini's first stage work. As his entry in a competition, it showed off his ability tp compose sunny cheerfulness in the first half, followed by darkness and despair. There is a lot of ballet, demonstrating his ability to write for dancers. But Puccini's famous melodies drenched with emotion have not yet arrived.",1481932800,,353,5.0
8170031,1,B000MMLPGY,"As bad as other reviewers have pointed out.  Unbelievably ugly voices from the three singers, idiotic music, this is definitely only for maniacs (like me) who absolutely have to see everything and hear everything when it comes to opera.  And, to boot, very lackluster production.",1462492800,,279,5.177777777777778
8170032,1,B000MMLPGY,"I love Puccini's operas and I understand that his early operas were not his best, but this DVD is not to my liking.  The soprano is bad and the director doesn't seem to know what to do with his characters while onstage. Soomeday there might be a better recording.  Until then...",1189468800,,278,4.431372549019608
8170033,2,B000MMLPGY,"I have always been fond of this opera and was excited at the thought of finally seeing a production. Unfortunately I also had to hear it. The soprano is worse than Susan Kane. Indeed one can only assume that like that unhappy singer in Citizen Kane she must have been the producer's wife or girlfriend. She is quite pretty but the voice shakes more than a reed in the wind and is seldom on key. I have never heard a so-called professional who was that bad.
The others are average, but next to her seem better than they are. If like me you want to be able to say you've seen this rarely performed work than rent it or buy the cheapest you can find. If you don't know the work then buy the CD with Domingo and Scotto and let this DVD go by.",1182470400,3,738,4.096551724137931
8170034,4,B000MMLPGY,"Le Villi has some beautiful music in it. It is beautifully orchestrated.  So, it has a rather silly plot.  So do nearly all of Mozart's and Wagner's operas, and many of Verdi's.

My personal opinion is that Le Villi supplied Mascagni with many orchestration ideas for Cavalleria Rusticana and even a melody or two.",1178928000,5,314,4.777777777777778
8170035,4,B000MMLPGY,"I had preordered this DVD and, having read the other reviews approached watching it with dread.  Expecting nothing, I was pleasantly surprised.  If you are looking at this, then you are interested in seeing what Puccini's first opera looks like, and this DVD will give you that experience.  The vast majority of the works interest lies in the music written for the men, chorus, or orchestra alone.  All are at least adequate.  The story is silly (even for opera) but does not overstay its welcome as the DVD last just over an hour. This is a live performance. At times the audience applauded what was going on on stage.  Their applause seemed appropriate.",1178841600,6,655,4.752212389380531
8170036,1,B000MMLPGY,"With the tenor as the only excepcion, and perhaps the ballet these performance is a total disaster! The ""corner stone"" is the soprano. Something to forget inmediatelly (my apologies for my disastrous English!)",1177372800,2,209,5.363636363636363
8170037,2,B000MMLPGY,I ordered this DVD with great anticipation to finally see a staged production of Puccini's first work.  The staging is traditional and suggests what the composer might have observed in Milan of 1884. Tenor Albert Montserrat has a plesant youthful ring to his voice and has promise for better parts.  Montserrat Marti is adequate as the father but looks comic (when he shouldn't) in a ridiculous wig. The chorus is solid.  The big problem lies with soprano Halla Margret.  She is a young attractive woman and a decent actress but engages in the worst caterwauling I have ever heard from a professional singer.  The voice is unsteady and sounds like an aging singer who has performed way too many Santuzza's.  This experience makes me dread watching the DVD of Edgar with the same cast.  The dancers are initially interesting but become tedious with repetition of the same movements and gestures.  This one goes in the recycle bin and I will return to my CD of Scotto and Domingo in a transcendent performance.,1176422400,12,1008,4.819767441860465
