8242373,2,B0011UBDUE,"Unfortunately, this appears t just be the mash-up of some home movies.  There are a few stylish, artistic segments, but not as many as I would have liked.  Also, the menu is all in pictures with some japanese characters, which doesn't lend any understanding to navigating through. And since this dvd plays segments one by one, you must navigate the menu to advance through the dvd.",1402876800,,381,4.757575757575758
8242374,5,B0011UBDUE,"to be fair if anyone is interested in the young,fashion,funky and trendy  night/streetlife side of tokyo then this dvd hits the spot. its shows a lot of shibuya and shinjiku plus more and all the street life/nightlife goings on and what you would see on a stroll round the city centre on a night out exploring. even though not a travel guide and no narrative but great music beats playing to compliment it does show a lot of interesting street musicians and residents. it is really well shot with excellent picture quality, so i would recommend this for those (young) of us who have been to tokyo an love the place and this dvd will bring back a few memories of tokyo night/streetlife eveytime you watch it with a few drinks on a saturday night",1345507200,,744,4.511111111111111
8242375,2,B0011UBDUE,Don't buy this DVD!  The package art is awesome but really misleading.  Even the title menus are well done and artistic.  But the actual video content is someone holding a consumer camcorder and filming tokyo street performers.  The audio is terrible and editing is slow and boring. There is no commentary or interviews or anything worth watching.,1260748800,,347,5.035087719298246
8242376,3,B0011UBDUE,"Let me say first that I have been to Japan/Tokyo many times. I bought this DVD to supplement my own ""home movies"" as a showcase for the uninitiated, as anyone who has been to Japan knows...it's almost impossible to describe unless you have been there.
In one sense, the film(?) does do that. It also has a unique...so...Japanese way of delivering the goods. That is..the concept is not a linear documentary, but you seem to travel via subway and JR to the various famous districts of Tokyo. You even get to ride on the trains, exit the stations as if you were there...cool...But on the neg. I found the ALL PLAY option only by accident, which, if I want to see a sequence again is a must. There is no chapter menu. The segments are only shown as little icons. The train icon(s) will take you to another part of Tokyo. Then there are sub-icons of the various street scenes...
I guess if you can read a Japanese newspaper, it will be a piece of cake. But to my less than excellent Japanese reading skills, it is bothersome. (no, it is not written in Japanese, but you have to ""think"" Japanese to understand it.
The clips themselves can be very interesting or somewhat boring. Some too short, and some too long. It is a matter of taste. I like the musical street acts. The a capella girls were great. The rock band played too long. I didn't really care for the hip-hop dancers, and the guy that did the torch thing went on too long. The street artist in Harajuku was good. The Rockabilly guys were trying hard...

I thought the fashion show ludicrous, with a forced, ""hey look at me"" attitude..pricy, but totally clueless designers, while the kids in Harajuku were real...more cutting edge and fun.

I almost fell asleep when the girl was getting her hair cut, as with the long segment of video gamers. At the end of it all, I was wishing the train would take me to my little flat on Omotesando, but instead I ended up right back where I started....

All in all, a good effort, but I can recommend this only if you have no idea about Tokyo at all, or haven't seen much better documentaries about Japan. If you can pick this up on sale for a few bucks..get it, it's artsy enough, but as a film documentary, it's more like someone was just walking around Tokyo turning on their camcorder when they bumped into something interesting.",1217548800,,2327,4.457746478873239
