He is in Japan & either they don't know the music, don't understand the music, or just are not enthusiastic, but Joe put on an excellent show! He sings most of his previous hits, & some of his newer songs from his newest release (at that time).

4187722,4,B003S6T62Q,Like one of the other review I agree with the statement about it's time that artist start promoting thier artistry in a different format. A lot of people can't see these artist for one reason or another. We hear them on cd or see thier video on television. Watching a concert is far more excitinig then watching a video on television. For the price you are getting a real bargin. I loved the dvd and for those who hasn't got it yet get it before these artists start disappearing. Keep it Live Joe.,1282089600,,497,4.354838709677419
4187723,5,B003S6T62Q,"This is coming from the perspective of a ""huge"" Joe fan.  I never thought Joe got the credit he deserves from the industry and music fans.  I am glad to see that someone is coming up with new ideas to promote Joe's music, something more than CDs for his fans to enjoy.  I saw Joe live in concert in Boston, at Berklee Performance Center, and I will never forget it.

This DVD is quality in terms of it's audio and edits, and not only does it come with more than an hour of live performance, you also get three of Joe's most recent music videos to add to your collection.  I was pleased to be walking through the store and see that Joe has a live concert DVD on the shelves.  I think his new record label is doing the right thing.

Joe's performance was recorded in Japan, in front of a Japanese audience of course.  Joe does a great job with the vocals, with a full band behind him, small horn section, drums, keys, guitar and bass.  He sounds great, but he also performs an acoustic selection of songs from the ""All that I Am"" album.  You get to see that Joe can play guitar and sing at the same time.  Not many of Joe's fans know that he plays the guitar.  I believe the performance covers a complete list of Joe's best songs.  Some of them are shortened or in the form of a medley, but I believe he picked the right songs to perform at length.  He focuses on some of his most recent music, because obviously he wants to promote his latest albums.  But, he performs all of his older stuff including ""Stutter,"" ""I Wanna Know,"" and ""Good Girls.""  Joe performs all of his current singles as well.

The disc is very enjoyable, but I must say that I do not think it should have been filmed in Japan.  The Japanese must express excitement about music very differently than American audiences.  They seem awful quiet in the audience, and it does not show the excitement that Joe creates with the American audience.  I suppose it is just a cultural difference, and perhaps they enjoyed the music just as much.  In that way, it is unlike most live DVDs, the ones you see of R. Kelly or Usher are quite different in the level of excitement.  But, I've been to Joe's concert live and I know the excitement is there.  Despite this, I still give it 5 stars!!

Overall, I highly recommend this DVD, if you buy it, you won't regret it!!",1282089600,10,2323,4.287356321839081
4187724,3,B003S6T62Q,"Joe is an awesome vocalist and he performed well in the concert. The main problem was that he short changed us on the songs that made him so popular. He spent most of time on stage singing newer, less appealing songs. Joe only song a short medley of the songs from his best CD's (All that I am, My name is Joe and Better Days). These were the songs that I really wanted to hear. Also, when compared to R. Kelly's (Light it up)concert DVD, this seemed low budget and looked like it was filmed in a small night club. Joe is one of my favorite artists, but he needs to spend more time singing his signature songs from the previously mentioned CD's.",1280448000,,645,4.252032520325203

4187731,2,B003S6T62Q,"It's Joe, live from Japan! In horrible picture and sound quality!

This thing looks and feels like it was recorded from a really cheap, barely working camcorder. You can get better picture and sound quality from YouTube these days, and this DVD feels really outdated.

Joe performs most of his hit songs you'll recognize, the problem is this thing is hard to enjoy due to how hard it is to watch. I honestly get much better mileage just listening to an old CD, or yeah, watching his music videos on YouTube.

Do yourself a favor and save your money. One day, hopefully, Joe will release a real DVD with some quality to it and it will be a much better buy than this thing is. I'd have a hard time recommending this even to die hard fans of his.",1398556800,,743,4.330935251798561
4187732,3,B003S6T62Q,"I have been a long-time fan of Johnny Winter's music.  In his prime he was an amazing blues guitar player.  After buying his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roots/dp/B005CW5E3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roots</a>&nbsp;album that was recently released and really liking it I thought I would give this concert DVD a try.  One of his other concert DVDs, Live in the 80's, was a waste of money due to its poor video and recording quality, so I was hesitant to buy this disc.

The performance was recorded in April 2011.  The video quality is definitely improved over Live in the 80's, but the audio quality remains poor.  The audio is basically all from the center speaker in a 5.1 audio system, so the sound will be underwhelming to say the least.  The mixing is horrid -- most of the recorded sound emphasizes Winters' guitar and the drummer; the backup guitarist is barely audible (who is a very good guitarist, by the way, and plays licks much like Winter), and the bass is minimized.  Even Winter's singing is barely audible.  In this day and age such poor recording quality is totally unacceptable.

The song selection is good, but execution of the songs is borderline in spots.  I don't know if it was intended to be homage or just losing his train of thought, but in several songs Winters would drift off into guitar riffs made famous by other guitarists like Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Richards, and Stevie Ray Vaughan during some of his extended guitar solos.  It's like he ran out of ideas what to play during the song, and the riffs didn't seem to fit well.  Winter can still play some fancy guitar, but you can tell he is long past his prime.  Had the sound been mixed better I think the overall presentation, though, would have been more pleasurable.

If you are a Johnny Winter fan wanting to have a record of one of his live performances you may want this DVD for your collection.  Just don't expect the sound to be up to his usual standards.  For a far better listening experience, pick up his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roots/dp/B005CW5E3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roots</a>&nbsp;album.  It is by far one of his best recordings ever.",1396569600,,2248,5.146005509641873
4187733,3,B003S6T62Q,"Wanted this DVD from day one, but didn't get it until recently.  First.... I am and have always been a fan and supporter of Mr. Winter.  Really appreciate how this band has supported him, too.  However....

Good news, bad news.  Video, camera work is quite nice.  Audio quality is quite, well, how should it be said....  poor.  The mix is very sloppy, levels are sloppy.  And come on.... just stereo???  Is it really that much more expensive to do a 5.1 mix for a DVD?  Anyway, very poor sound quality on this one.  I wanted very much to really love this DVD, but I just can't.

That being said, it is great to see Mr. Winter on the return.  I just love his Roots CD.  Very excellent performances.  As for the performances on this DVD, it appears that perhaps there were many missed notes, phrases, etc in the playing.  The band really helps to hold him up.  But even if the playing was not quite up to certain levels of performance, that is fine.  If the sound quality would have been better, it still would have been a much better viewing and listening experience.  The performances really aren't that big of a deal, but quality is an issue here.

I believe that Mr. Winter will continue to become  pretty much the great player that he is known for, given the fact that yes, we all loose a bit with age.  Perhaps a remix and re-issue of this DVD would be a good thing... or better yet, a brand new live DVD that is produced by real pros!

I love Johnny Winter and will continue to support him, but this product is just plain and simple not a very good product.... purely due to technical sound issues that may or may not be under his guidance.

A great big thanks to Johnny and especially his band for keeping on keeping on.",1396483200,,1726,4.31875

The performances just kept on getting better and better as the concert progressed. The selection of grooves that Joe chose to sing on this DVD was just brilliant. All the songs are great but in particular 'I Wanna Know' and 'Majic' will totally blow you away. In short, a priceless performance. Now I know why I own every single Joe album.

4187742,5,B003S6T62Q,"JOHNNY WINTER LIVE FROM JAPAN (DVD)
Marc Wickert [...]

What an incredibly powerful performance from this legendary bluesman and his rock-solid accompanying band.  BAM!  If you only ever purchase one music DVD this is the one to buy.

The show kicks off Chicago-blues style with an intro by the pedigree Johnny Winter Band, with highly-respected guitarist Paul Nelson grabbing some solo neck before Johnny shuffles onstage, offloading pure R'n'B (rhythm and blues - not that latest crap) licks from his Erlewine Laser guitar, a brand he's been using since 1984.  He's sporting one of his traditional Texan cowboy hats and sits upfront like Merlin whipping up a tempest.  Johnny Winter must be the most powerful man on the planet!

This is a trip - a ride down the Blues Highway - as Winter and his rockin' cohorts head for the Crossroads of 61 and 49 whilst summoning up the spirits of such masters as Muddy, Robert and Elmore.

Freddie King's Hideaway rolls out next and the band are as tight as a fish's ...  Johnny introduces the group's rhythm section: Vito Liuzzi on Pearl drums and vocals, and Scott Spray on Yamaha bass.  Both members of the `Blues Beret Special Forces' provide tasty solo teasers before general play resumes.  It's probably around now that the younger ones in the audience ask, ""Hey Dad, what are those cables doing coming out of their guitars?""

Winter's solos have always been uniquely melodic and thought out: He doesn't just dispatch a load of scales or boring notes, but takes his listeners on an exciting journey each time.  Johnny also mixes in tribute riffs, such as Jimi Hendrix's Third Stone From The Sun, Jack Bruce's Sunshine Of Your Love, and even a bit of Peter Gunn.

Johnny Winter's career started when he was knee high to a Beaumont grasshopper, practising after school on his guitar for six to eight hours a night, always employing the thumb-picking style he picked up from bluegrass performer Merle Travis.

Sugar Coated Love (not mentioned on the track listings), and She Likes To Boogie Real Low immediately follow.  There are no pauses in this delivery - the band delivers a shock-awe blasting, not letting the stunned audience recover from this staggering assault.  This is a hard-working band and it's impossible to stop your feet tapping along.

They rip into Good Morning Little School Girl, a song Johnny did on his debut Johnny Winter album.  Then there's the Got My Mojo Working tribute to Muddy Waters, a man Winter played and produced for on four of his albums - three becoming Grammy winners.

Johnny's solos are so slick, it's no wonder Jimi loved to jam with him, sometimes strapping on a bass to let Winter have some neck!  Paul Nelson lays down great accompanying lead; Vito Liuzzi machineguns the skins and provides backing vocals; whilst Scott Spray bends his bass strings, adds vocals (without a mic) and practises his dance steps.

These guys are smokin' and there's no way Johnny's going to let the crowd, who have been rocking on their feet since the intro, sit down.  So they tear into Chuck Berry's Johnny B. Goode, a tune from Second Winter.

It's not until Ray Charles's Black Jack that Johnny eases off the throttle for some slow blues, and yet the Tokyo audience remains on their feet and amped to the eyeballs. What an incredible impact the Johnny Winter Band is having!

Tore Down - Vito gives Winter's vocal chords a rest and somehow the song seems to take on a Carl Perkins twist.  Not sure if it's the All Tore Down tune from the Still Alive and Well album - only the titles sound similar, but it's a lot of fun anyway.

Johnny gets back vocal duties for Lone Wolf (from I'm A Bluesman), which runs right into Don't Take Advantage Of Me (from Guitar Slinger), with the song grinding into the Stone's Gimme Shelter. OMG - these guys are brilliant!  It feels like they've been playing together since 1066; everything just flows.

It was important that Johnny blast back with so much pure, crisp guitar work on this DVD after the video Johnny Winter Live In Times Square was released years ago, contrary to Winter's wishes.  This `Guitar Slinger' is truly one of the greatest axe grinders of all time.  His poor ranking on Rolling Stone's top 100 is far more of an embarrassment to the magazine than it is to Johnny Winter.

Bony Moronie (off Saints and Sinners) rolls out next.  It's like the truck Dean Moriarty hitched a ride on in Kerouac's On The Road: There are no stops!  For Womack and Womack's It's All Over Now, the Stone's working is adopted, but with a bit more grunt.  Finally, Winter spots an aglu and the band comes up for air.

The audience demands an encore and the band are happy to please.

Johnny Winter makes a bold statement here - not only is he Still Alive And Well, but he's cooler than ever.  It's appropriate that the born-again bluesman close the show with his '64 Firebird Gibson, having resurrected his career from the flames just like the Phoenix.  A lot of credit here goes to executive producer Paul Nelson who has done so much to help Winter get back on the horse and accompanies Johnny on lead and rhythm in a fashion Keith Richards refers to as ""guitar weaving"".

Winter always plays slide on one of his Firebirds.  He first heard the slide guitar being played on the radio by Muddy Waters and tried running all sorts of household items up and down his guitar strings, attempting to capture that same sound, before buying 12 feet of plumber's pipe and sawing a piece off it each time a `slide' wore out.  Wonder how much of the pipe is left?

Johnny and the band hammer home Robert Johnson/Elmore James's Dust My Broom and Bob Dylan's Highway 61 with unrelenting power and passion.  What a way to close a show.  Long live the King of slide guitar! We've just been transported down the length of the Blues Highway.
In 1969, Johnny Winter conducted the Progressive Blues Experiment - now he's back with the stunning results.

Johnny Winter Live From Japan is a Mind-Blowing DVD.  It would be nice to see the `Guitar Slinger' and this same band return with a follow-up DVD comprising all Johnny Winter compositions: ""I'm Yours, I'm Hers; White Line Blues, Mean Town Blues; Rock And Roll...

4187754,3,B003S6T62Q,"3 1/2 Stars.  I am a Johnny Winter fan -period.  His influences are the real deal, he himself is the real deal and his musical legacy is one for the ages.

As a fan who owns Johnny's music on album, cassette and CD as well as the DVDs: ""Live Through the 70's"", ""Live Through the 80's"" and ""Live in Times Square"", I could not pass up this DVD ""Live in Japan"" for $10.

This is by far an improvement over the Times Square DVD (I feel that DVD was a pure money grab as Johnny was a shell of himself physically and musically during that tour unfortunately).  On this DVD the 16X9 aspect ratio and multiple camera angles work and are well edited. The audio seems fine on the small system I used when watching this show.  His band is good and certainly add to Johnny's crowd pleasing performance.  If I was in the live audience on this night in Japan, I would have left feeling satisfied.  The volume levels, crowd noise, enthusiasm and room echo minimize the effect of some mistakes, flat notes and timing.  On this DVD Johnny is in much better form than in the Times Square performance and it is great to see improvement vs further diminished skills.

I give this 3 1/2 stars because his guitar playing is good but not great. Johnny's Icon status gives him the right to perform to fans that will pay to see him (and there is still plenty -myself included- who will) but this DVDs level of performance would not have made Johnny the legend he is today.  If you are OK with that you will be glad you got this DVD, but if you are buying this hoping to see a fabulous Texas blues player at the peak of his skills, you may be less than satisfied.  The songs played are mainly classics that have been covered many times by many musicians ... I would have liked to see him reach for some less known but solid songs that he has in his bag of tricks ... he chose not to it seems.  I could easily give this 5 stars just because I appricate Johnny Winter but I chose to give my honest assessment of this DVD ... 3 1/2 stars.

With this said, I hope Johnny continues to perform for as long as he wants ... he deserves it.

Edit: July 20 2014 ... Johnny's passing gives this era of his career important historic value for a fan like me.  Thank goodness it is apparent that Johnny's passion and skills continued to recover from this performance forward to his passing just days ago.  This DVD's performance documents a new phase in time where Johnny looks to be enjoying playing live (and recording) as much as any time in his career ...yet remaining very humble in interviews.

Thank goodness that, shortly before his death, a documentary on his life was filmed that he got to see (Trailer:[...]) as well as a new CD (Step Back) recorded with big-league guest musicians joining in to pay respects. He spoke of both these projects with enthusiasm in his final interviews (go to YouTube).  Of course these will be posthumous releases but at least Johnny was aware they were in the works for release.  He practiced his craft to the end and was privileged to see the genuine respect that his fans and fellow musicians had for him in his last days.

RIP Johnny and thank you!",1345593600,21,3153,4.355555555555555
4187755,4,B003S6T62Q,"It's nice to see Mr. Winter ""still alive and well"". Paul Nelson and the rest of the band really know how to support Johnny so that he can put his best foot forward. (I hope he hangs onto these guys for a long time.) It's also nice to see Johnny standing for a portion of the performance. (He had hip surgery in the past.) But the best part of this video is taking the Johnny Winter energy ride for another spin around the track. He has never failed to amaze me, (and I have been a fan for almost forty years).",1344816000,12,509,4.0495049504950495
4187756,5,B003S6T62Q,"I've seen this video and his playing is very, very good. If you like JW and realize that he's about 70 years old and a bit slower, then you will love this disc. His backing back smokes!!

Don't take advantage of me has cool teases of Sunshine of Your Love and a Stones hit! Most of the tunes are from Live 97 and his recent CDs, plus several of his standards like All Over Now, Johnny B. Goode and Highway 61.

I saw him in 1999 and thought he could not survive and tour another year, he looked that bad. I really have to hand it to his new management and band (and wife) who have kept him going and allowed him to thrive in the 21st century. It's minor miracle if you ask me.",1343520000,27,676,4.0

4187759,5,B003S6T62Q,"OMG!! Joe Live From Japan DVD is absolutely wonderful! Joe's lyrical writings, vocals, guitar musicianship and committment to excellence is evident throughout his performance. All the musicians in the band are ""beasts"" with their individual artistry. Tonal quality, timing and the ability to compliment Joe's vocals on every song is the best. I highly recommend this well-produced DVD. Thanks, Joe! Blessings",1317945600,,408,5.704918032786885

This concert was taped over overseas in Japan for Billboard, thus my reason for 4 stars,it's interesting how fans overseas will sing the lyrics, but cannot speak english, music really is the universal language.",1298246400,,249,4.813953488372093

8404060,3,B003S6T62Q,"I was disappointed with this. Johnny Winter is a legend, and after reading the reviews I ordered it right away - as it's a modern recording. All the raves about this DVD are misleading. The sound quality is ok at best (by today's standards) but this features a shell of the real Johnny Winter. He looks like he's at death's door (he died shorty after) and doesn't have any semblance of his mojo anymore.",1498003200,,403,4.45945945945946
