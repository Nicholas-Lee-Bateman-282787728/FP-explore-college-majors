The key is to work out more and eat less.",1414800000,,80,3.764705882352941
8286410,5,B001CB96QU,"Love the dvd, it's the one I wanted!! Been doing the workout every other day. I was happy to receive it in such a short time. Thanks again.",1393200000,,139,4.0
8286411,4,B001CB96QU,"I love kickboxing and this one features regularly in my rotation. It's a great pace for an intermediate level exerciser although the kickboxing section is only 20 minutes long, and all up the workout goes 45 min.  It also features a 5 minute warm up (tai-chi based) and there's a good 15 minute muscle conditioning section at the end which focuses mainly on lower limbs and core.  The lunges here are a killer! I like this for days when I want to do a shorter, but intense, cardio session with toning but not as interval training.  Sharon's very perky and she squeals ALOT (soo many woooooh! s) - I thought I'd be irritated beyond belief but in fact once I get started, I hardly notice. She cues well and doesn't really stop smiling the whole workout. There are  modifiers for both beginners and advanced (used mostly in the toning section) so lots of options there.  Not for newbies to kickboxing though, as she doesn't explain any of the punches or kicks, it's just assumed knowledge. At the end, everyone gathers round and waves you goodbye - sounds cheesy but somehow it works as a nice touch.  Some people might find her enthusiasm OTT, but I usually find myself smiling (or more accurately grimacing in the strength section) along with her in this one and always look forward to the days I've scheduled it.",1357171200,3,1312,4.609442060085837
8286412,2,B001CB96QU,What is going on here? they don't teach you any moves just suppose to follow alone blindly. not for me. Turbo Jam is waay better! Everyone is cheezy too.,1291939200,,153,4.310344827586207
8286413,4,B001CB96QU,This is a great workout for your whole body. I have been doing kickboxing for years and I really worked up a sweat! There is a really annoying lady in this video. She looks like she is on crack and jumping all over the place. She really does put a damper on this entire video. Watching her exercise while doing the workout is really annoying. I think the video would have been a 10 without her in it. She stand to the left of Sharon and wears a striped shirt and has on blue pants. I find her very distracting in a bad way! If you can get past her in the video then you are good to go!!,1278547200,,586,3.9327731092436973
8286414,5,B001CB96QU,"I was quite pleasantly surprised by this workout.  It kept my interest (so many exercise DVDs bore me) and was challenging enough without being frustrating.  It also made me work up a really good sweat.

When I read on the cover that Sharon is a national aerobics champion (I presume in Canada) I was expecting a really cheesy annoying instructor but she's quite good -- motivating without getting on your nerves.

Highly recommended.",1244592000,7,434,4.904109589041096
8286415,5,B001CB96QU,I highly recommend this work out video. Sharon makes you use all the abdominal muscles and noticed the difference in my body after a few weeks. highly recommended.,1230595200,7,163,4.857142857142857
8286416,4,B001CB96QU,"This video is excellent! Sharon's video motivates you and before you know it ...you are sweating it off!

Great price and great work out!",1121385600,4,137,4.708333333333333
