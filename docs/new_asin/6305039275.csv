7881500,5,6305039275,"I've watched it quite a few times, and I found it to be one of the most accurate, to-the-point Bible prophecy narratives. Yes, reading some of the other reviews, you would think it's more a post-tribulation rapture point of view. Actually, interestingly enough, if ones dares to depart from the generally accepted pre-tribulation view and search the Bible for oneself, you come up with a rather interesting point of view: (Matthew 24:29-31).The keyword there is ""after the tribulation of those days""... Very clear there what is actually going to happen. So yes, that was quite enlightening and helps dispel an often misconstrued viewpoint. Some other verses that I discovered that support this are: Deut. 4:29-31; Mark 13:23-25; Revelation 7:13-15). Of course, every one is entitled to their own point of view, but I found when I was open to this possibility and checked things out for myself, I found myself finding something rather enlightening. I guess the only way to know is to go through it - by watching things happen. But it's heartening to know that we have a roadmap for our future - right in the Bible. So now who was saying, ""I don't know what will happen?""",1154476800,,1169,4.85
7881501,5,6305039275,"Having studied Bible prophecy for the past 20 years, I am extremely familiar with this subject. The main part I disagree with is placing the Gog-Magog war of Ezekiel 38-39 in the Tribulation Period. It just doesn't fit. The film tries to make Gog of Magog the Worthless Shepherd and there are varying and valid viewpoints that differ. (See Arnold Fruchtenbaum's teachings in Ice and Demy's wonderful book ""Prophecy Watch"").
There are a few minor errors, such as Nahum 2:4 used for the End-Times when it really speaks of the fall of the Assyrian capital of Nineveh some 70 years after Jonah the prophet was sent to them. The film presents a pre-wrath view whereas I would be pre-trib. The film's viewpoint shows the Marriage Supper of the Lamb occurring during the Great Tribulation. Additionally, the film doesn't specifically state that Jesus is not a prophet, that He is the King of Kings and should be explicitly referenced as such (Matthew 16:13-17, Revelation 19). Though referenced at the end of the film, the Quran denies the Deity of Christ (4.171), a major and clear contradiction to the Matthew 16 verse presented above. Additionally, the image from Revelation 13 cannot be a computer as the film suggests, for it comes to ""life"".
There is excellent footage that demonstrates the ""signs of the times"". The well-read will learn from it as will the person new to this subject. Warning: not for the kiddies. This is heavy material and might be too much for young minds. Well worth the price. With the noted exceptions, the material is well-presented and contextually accurate overall. With a bit of minor editing it could be even better. I also recommend ""End Times in the Words of Jesus"", also available in VHS format at Amazon. Com.
This review is for the VHS version of the film. There is some minor bonus material (Q & A) on the DVD but the VHS is just as good. One reviewer on the DVD version claimed the film purports to be science fiction. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is narrated Bible Prophecy, with some events acted out or demonstrated.",1031443200,14,2069,4.75
7881502,1,6305039275,"This film purports to be science fiction.  Unfortunately it's really thinly disguised religious propaganda.
The film's sole purpose was to deliver a message from the fundamentalist Christian perspective, and it did do that.
What it did not do was tell an interesting or even believeable story.  The characters were all two dimensional, and there was no gray in the world depicted...only black and white.
I found the film, as a science fiction piece, to be very disappointing.",995500800,13,475,5.1558441558441555

However,  fairly accurate renderings of Bible Prophecy, though appears to offer a pre-wrath view and I lean towards pre-trib.  The well-read will learn  from it as will the person new to this subject.  Warning: not for the  kiddies.  This is heavy material and might be too much for young minds.  Well worth the price.  Prophecies of the qur'an do not match those of the Bible, though; not by a long shot.  To claim so, as this movie does at the end, is fallacy.",951436800,23,617,4.559633027522936
