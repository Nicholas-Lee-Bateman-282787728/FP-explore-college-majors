8486764,2,B005U7XB72,"While the video of the waterfalls is OK, I felt that the music chosen was terrible. The music is loud & harsh sounding and not relaxing. There is NO nature sounds at all and NO option to not play the music. When I have viewed this DVD, I have chosen to mute the sound to make it tolerable.",1434412800,,289,4.0
