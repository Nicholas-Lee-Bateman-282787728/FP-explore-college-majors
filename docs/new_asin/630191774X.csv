7816703,1,630191774X,"Dull and moronic slasher movie about a mad killer who uses a double-sided axe to kill coeds who have been corrupted by sex.  Somehow he is killing a bunch of young woman but the only person who suspects is a transfer student looking for her big story for the school paper.  The slasher genre isn't exactly demanding so when someone makes one that fails this completely it always comes as a shock to me.  One very obvious problem is that there isn't any gore--so this kind of feels like the Made-for-TV version of a slasher film.  Another is that the movie wastes a ridiculous amount of time with unfunny sub-Animal House fraternity pranks.

You see there's this fraternity that was banned from campus the year before but now they're back--and they pull a bunch of mean-spirited or gross pranks that can only lead bored viewers to the conclusion that they are looking to get banned again as quickly as possible.  Then there's the fact that the script is simply very stupid, even by the low requirements of the slasher genre.

Our intrepid girl reporter finds that one of the missing girls posed for racy pictures after hours in the science lab.  Since she thinks something nefarious happened to the girl you would think the fact that a double-sided axe is stamped on each of the 100 dollar bills she was paid might pique her interest.  One of the frat brother's girlfriends was brutally murdered the year before in a place they met in secret since her father didn't approve of the relationship.  The fact that her body was found in a secret meeting place suggests the murder wasn't random--you would think this frat brother might be more interested in figuring out who killed his girlfriend than in silly college pranks.  Actually it turns out he is--but the fact that he was secretly investigating the murder is never mentioned or shown until the last 5 minutes of the movie.  Then there's the dean who keeps insisting that there is no murderer on campus even though his daughter is the one who was killed the year before and her killer was never caught.

There's simply no reason for a movie as awful as Rush Week to exist--a below average film student with an interest in horror movies could have churned out a better script than this over a drunken weekend and would have done it just for the screen credit.  The makers of Rush Week don't seem to have ever actually seen a horror movie before judging by how badly misjudged every element of this film is--there is no suspense or gore, no gratuitous nudity, a lot of party music and lame gags that don't really help create a creepy mood--Rush Week is just lazy garbage by people trying to cash in on a genre they clearly had no fondness or understanding of--at the very least they should have attended a Friday the 13th triple feature for research purposes before unleashing this unredeemable dreck on the world.",1437091200,,2864,4.645544554455445

7816706,5,630191774X,"This is a review of the video. I taped this movie from cable 20+ years ago. I had not seen it since, and while I remember the basic characters, especially Ludwig's fabulous portrayal of the plucky college reporter determined to get to the bottom of all the co-ed disappearances on campus, I was astonished to see that I had actually forgotten much of the plot in the ensuing years.

For what it is, this movie is a Five-Star jewel. I loved the lead characters and their actors, as well as the supporting roles. I honestly had forgotten who the killer was, and had to be surprised all over again when the climax of the movie hits. As I was in college during the time period when the movie was made, it was nostalgic for me to see the phone booths and the bulletin boards in the middle of campus the way things used to be in America's colleges. Alas, things have changed in the 21st century. One interesting note to see are the beginnings of email, which at that time was only used by governmental or media agencies and of course college campuses.

Buy this movie on DVD and you will not be disappointed. Remember that it's from a movie genre that will appeal only to those who enjoy horror and/or suspense films.

7816709,1,630191774X,"I bought this thinking it was a slasher - wrong.  It's a third rate rip off of Animal House.  Oh, there's a slasher subplot buried in there under all the painfully unfunny fraternity hijinks, but with all the silliness going on, these people couldn't create an ounce of suspense if their lives depended on it.  The two main characters are as boring as can be, I couldn't even finish this crappy thing.  There's a very good reason that all these horror/comedies are completely forgotten these days, while the straight slashers like Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm street are considered classics.",1224892800,3,611,4.902912621359223
7816710,5,630191774X,"A successful 'killer on a college campus' film is hard to come by for slasher fans. Happy Hellnight, Splatter University, and Girls Nite Out are just a few examples of the many disapointments that fans have to wade through. Every now and then our toil and trouble pays off when we discover a classic that makes the searching all worth it.
Rush Week is worth it. It has what you pay the price of admission to see. Lots of naked 80's babes. Animal House/Back To School college sterotypes (rival rich boy frats, a boring science teacher, a crazy cafeteria worker, and an old-timer Dean).
Amoungst all the goodtimes and practical jokes a killer wanders around in a mask and a black hood giving to axe to loose students and prostitutes. The party scenes are excellent for their excessive use of 80's punk and bar bands.
My only gripe with this film is lack of gore. But there is plenty to make up for it, including that fat kid from Friday The 13th Part V and the Sheriffs smoking hot daughter from Halloween 4.
The DVD is in fullscreen with a better than average screen quality. The sound quality is good as well. No real special features except for a ""movie factoids"" section which is just filmographies of the actors in the film.
This film is out of print, but then again what classic horror gem is not. Look for it and buy it.",1215475200,5,1325,4.45679012345679
7816711,2,630191774X,"Dude! Somebody's, like, killing nubile young co-eds and the only one who can solve the murders is a cutie-pie spunky young college newspaper reporter! Dude!
""Rush Week"" is yet another in a long line of uninspired slasher films. A young transfer student must write a fluff piece about rush week. She falls for the president of a wild fraternity, who also happens to be our main suspect in the murders. Young women are being hacked open with a giant axe just after posing nude for photographs taken by the cafeteria cook (and ours would just put extra cheese on the pizza). The women are disappearing all over, and of course the final frat party has a Halloween theme, just to throw in more red herrings than you can shake a severed head at. The party scenes feature so many poor local bands trying to make the most of their big cinematic break, I wanted to hunt down the party committee chair and off him with an axe. The way too long finale takes place in ""the science building,"" apparently fictional colleges do not name their buildings after former university presidents. The real killer is revealed (big duh), reporter and frat boy live happily ever after.
On the positive, we do have the nude co-eds. I appreciate the female form as much as the next horror film reviewer, and it is on display here. There are bare male butts, but they are usually mooning people (oh, those crazy frats).
On the negative, the film piles on so much evidence that the frat president is the killer, you can pretty much guarantee he is not. He takes long midnight walks alone, has vicious mood swings, and goes to rescue spunky reporter in the finale wearing the exact same hood and robes as the killer. Is the killer the cafeteria cook? No, he just takes the nude pictures, he does not seem the killer type. Is the killer the biology gofer named Mort who skulks around the university's only cadaver? No, this minor suspect disappears half way through the film! Is the killer the spunky reporter's advisor, Gregg Allman? No, he has two scenes that last slightly longer than his marriage to Cher, and he proves he should not quit the classic rock county fair tour to start doing Shakespeare. Is the killer the dumb-named Dean of Students Grail? I was hoping his murdered daughter's name was Holly Grail, but no such luck. He is the only adult who is preoccupied with all the sin going on during rush week...hmmm...
The final nail in the coffin, as it were, is that we never see the nudie models killed. Sure, the maniac comes in and swings an axe, but no blood and no bodies! The whereabouts of the bodies is never discussed. The crime scene has just three drops of blood, the killer must be a neat freak. The only murders onscreen occur in the finale, and now we find out where the special effects budget went. In desperation on the film makers' part, the killer even jumps up to attack again after everyone figures he is dead. Like most Hollywood films set on campus, no one ever goes to class, they just party. I did that my sophomore year... and ended up being a fifth year senior since I only brought out six credits worth of passing grades. Then again, I wasn't going to the screenwriters' fantasy university in this film.
""Rush Week"" is no rush, and very weak. I do not recommend it.
This is rated (R) for physical violence, gore, some profanity, strong female nudity, some male nudity, and sexual content.",1023148800,6,3394,4.565573770491803
