3170739,5,B0017CW5V2,"Purchased this item only to watch Pet Semetary 2, I have always been a fan of the first one had to see the second.  I was very happy with this purchase, much to my amazement the sequel is as good as the first movie.  Highly recommend this movie if your into spooky, gorey films.  As for the Relic, never really caught my attention on the first viewing.  Not to say it's not good, just wasn't my bag.  In closing I got a great deal on a film I wanted.

Thank you",1256515200,3,461,4.010989010989011

3170741,2,B0017CW5V2,"I am from China, a fan of P.Ann Miller. I saw the movie RELIC 10 years ago here and it stunned me. So now when I knew the DVD is available I decided to take one. When I received the DVD from AMAZON and put the disc into the player for watching, it really STUNNED me again. Firstly,it is a D10 format,each movie is on one side so you cannot expect the bonus or multi audio track something like that, and the second thing what made me really piss off is for the movie RELIC, there is no MENU at the start( I have watching DVD for more than 7 years this is the first DVD I know without a MENU for choosing chapter, language and substitle.,etc, only get the icon PLAY to press in ) and the picture quality is as bad as the old VHS.What have they done to this movie? No such thing like remaster or improvement? Come on! This DVD was released in 2008!",1232928000,7,845,4.035714285714286

I searched high and low and could not find The Relic on DVD anywhere.  Thank you for getting it to us so quickly.  It is a family hit (we have not even watched Pet Sematary 2 yet).",1231459200,6,294,3.85

Why do you dumbbells keep taking these dead things to the cemetary with always negative creepy results?????  Relic monster took too long to show himself-pretty good monster though.  When you finally see glimpses of him.",1326326400,,293,5.041666666666667
8265629,5,B0017CW5V2,"Being a big fan of the authors of the book ""Relic,"" I enjoyed the movie. If you are expecting the movie to be the book, you will be disappointed.  However, if you are looking for a good thriller, this movie is for you.  I had no interest in the movie Pet Semetary 2, but it was on the disk.  I have not watched it.",1314144000,,314,3.875
8265630,4,B0017CW5V2,"hi, the relic is one of my favorite horror movies. it has an imagainative storyline, unlike many horror films today. it is truly scary & the gore is necessary for realism, but is not gratuitous. the special effects were good, but could have been better. in its defense, movie efx weren't as good then as they are now. pet semetary is ok, but i prefer the original. not all movies need a sequel. because these two are together i am unable to give them seperate ratings, but relic gets a 3.5 out of five while ps2 gets 2 out of five. because of this i am giving this review a 4 star rating.",1313798400,,588,4.212389380530974
