8346842,4,B001W0Z2N2,"How to Kill Christian provides an interesting perspective into this budding group of filmmakers and the journey they make to fulfill their vision of having their movie on the big screen. It documents the behind the scenes of the struggles involved in the film making process: from casting, to production, to scheduling and to the holy grail of indie filmmaking - financing. This isn't your Hollywood BTS special features slickly produced featurette. It is a camera in your face while we sit around a table and figure out how to get the money so the film crew will get back on set. Interestingly, in every scene where the producers lament the lack of financing, they are all standing around (or sitting) with cigarettes in mouth. Money going up in smoke! Overall, a very interesting look at what it takes and what it can do to a group of people giving their all to realize their dream.",1240963200,,884,4.673076923076923
