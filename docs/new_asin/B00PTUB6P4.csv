8689205,5,B00PTUB6P4,"This is the first season of Student Council's Discretion, a very funny spoof of harem shows. It is a 12-episode anime adaptation, produced by Studio Deen and directed by Takuya Sato, having aired in Japan between October 2 and December 18, 2009. A second season of the series is also available.

Central character Ken Sugisaki has just joined the prestigious Hekiyou Academy Student Council. The rest of the Student Council are the school's most popular girls, each representing an anime stereotype like the cold Tsundere. It's a delightful recipe for laughs, spoofing the harem format and turning it inside out. Ken dreams of turning the Student Council into his own private harem but the girls have something else in mind. This is a comedy with heart and sparkling wit, one of the funniest anime of the past decade.

Each character gets their own personality development as the jokes fly fast and furious. It's a zany comedy that makes fun of everything, from video games to other anime shows. It never takes the easy way out, remaining a parody of the harem genre until the very end.

The show is also known as Seitokai no Ichizon on Crunchyroll.",1433721600,4,1149,4.822335025380711
