2696559,1,B000KN7BN6,"how stupid is this film!!!!!!! I admire the guy who watched it till the end and wrote the long review.
 I just couldn't. I kept pressing ""forward"" button.
The story (is there one?) must have been written by a drug addict on huuuuuuge high. How anybody sane could create such dumb thing?
Acting is limited to the very limits and so is the action - but I think this won't surprise you.
Some of the scenes (like the one at the beginning with all the ""cowboy"" hustlers) made me laugh really loud!!!
And the BIG gun he carried in his jeans - HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.
If you look for hot bodies and steamy action, I will spare your time and money. The sex scenes are as hot as sibierian winters :)",1309132800,5,691,4.080882352941177
2696560,3,B000KN7BN6,"Let's say, hypothetically, you're sitting around with a bunch of your friends and all of you decide that you're going to purposefully make the absolute worst movie ever.  You would probably start with a weak opener like some married guy drives a sedan out into the desert to pick up a hooker with a heart of gold and then decides to drive said hooker back to his house and move the hooker into the guest room.  You would probably drop some gem of dialogue early in the movie to keep the audience guessing for about three seconds as to what the predictable plot twist is going to be.  Just for good measure you would probably use incredibly tired camera tricks like soft focus to let the audience know a character is good at heart but misunderstood or blue lighting to let the audience know there's a dream sequence featuring a flowy white dress or a gratuitous butt shot complete with a half profile of a guy looking over his shoulder in the moonlight all but saying ""come hither"".  You and your friends might also decide to have every character cry and embrace at the drop of a hat.  And finally, just to make sure your audience is completely disappointed, you'd make sure the cast doesn't even offer a decent contribution for the spank bank.  The movie that you and your friends would create would still be an Oscar winner compared to Cowboy Junction.

I put the movie in and started watching it.  Within the first minute there's an awkwardly staged fight in the desert between all the rent boys that are waiting for johns on a dirt road (not quite sure how that was supposed to work).  I nearly stopped the movie there, but decided to give it five more minutes.  During that five minutes, a john magically shows, picks up one of the guys, somehow manages to engage in a sexual act (I'm not sure which one), embraces the boy during his emotional breakdown, and drives the boy back to his home and casually introduces him to his wife as the new ""handyman"".

I just kept sitting there watching as the horrible-ness continued unfolding and promising myself I would only watch five more minutes.  Just when I thought ""this is as bad as it's going to get"", it would get worse.  I couldn't turn it off.  The whole time I was thinking, ""Surely, they meant for it to be this bad because there's no way they could have done this much wrong on accident.""

I wish everyone in the world would watch the movie because I don't think you can fully appreciate how bad it is just by reading a review.  You need to experience it for yourself.

My only reason for giving it three stars is I wish the distributors would rename the movie ""Cowboy Junction: The worst gay movie ever"" and market it as a parody of gay romance movies.",1293667200,10,2711,4.466531440162272
2696561,1,B000KN7BN6,"This has to be one of the worst directed, acted and story lines i've ever seen, gay themed or not. It starts with a guy driving a subcompact car (they couldn't even find a pick-up?) in the middle of nowhere in the desert and suddenly out of nowhere male hustlers just appear. Speaking of nowhere, that's exactly where this horrible movie goes. I normally suggest renting a movie before buying it but I wouldn't even bother renting this bomb. The lead character offers a little eye candy but even that gets old after the first ten minutes.",1290384000,13,538,4.556701030927835
2696562,1,B000KN7BN6,"NO ABRASIVE SEXUALITY BETWEEN THE ACTORS...........YOU CAN MAKE A MOVIE,SUCH AS THIS............MORE SEXUAL,DIRTY IN A GOOD WAY? IT WAS SOOOOOOOOOO BORING. I WASH MY HANDS ON THIS MOVIE.",1248480000,,186,5.678571428571429
2696563,2,B000KN7BN6,"Easily the worst movie I've seen this year. The production was amateurish from start to finish, with a poorly written story and bad acting. Really more of a video than a movie. The house had more ""character"" than the actors, and I found myself distracted by the sheer garishness and color choices apparently made from the reject paint at the local home center store. Based on this one experience, I will be adding the writer and the actors to my ""stay away from"" list, as this can't have been an isolated incident for any of them.
A truly unfortunate experience in movie watching",1243468800,,579,4.631067961165049
2696564,1,B000KN7BN6,"Despite appealing performances by the hustler and the betrayed wife, this movie sinks slowly and rises only occasionally in my jeans.  The story is good, the effort capable, with the worst ending ever.  The only good thing is the editing out of deleted scenes, which are so bad as to not be considered a bonus feature.",1200441600,,318,4.660714285714286
2696565,1,B000KN7BN6,Pity there is not a minus star rating - I was forced to rate this 1 star which it does not deserve. I cannot believe I wasted my money buying this junk. Serves me right for not reading reviews first.,1175558400,13,199,4.0
2696566,1,B000KN7BN6,"Cashing in on the huge success of ""Brokeback Mountain"", newcomer Gregory Christian writes and directs an 80 minute story that begs to be shot.  It's barely soft-porn, when a young gay cowboy is picked up at a ""junction"" and taken home to be a handy-man.  After sex with the husband, the wife gets into the scene and the whole thing just blows (only it just doesn't - wink, wink).  It's a silly tale that goes nowhere and ends nowhere and we wonder why good gay films aren't made more often.",1174262400,15,490,4.4222222222222225
2696567,1,B000KN7BN6,"I first had the ""pleasure"" of seeing this mess at a film festival-to say that it did not go over well is an understatement. While it tries vainly to be a Tennesee Williams type melodrama of secrets and forbidden love it really is just a showcase of bad acting and even worse storytelling. The husband's a closet case mope, the wife's a dim bulbed dope and the cowboy has the worst fake Southern accent outside of high school productions of ""Steel Magnolias"".  Scenes that are supposed to be high drama elicited laughs from the audience and if you can't see the ""surprise"" ending from a mile away, maybe it's just best that you lay off of movies for a while. I do give this film one star because the house it takes place in is an absolute riot of color(a laugh riot).",1173657600,30,766,4.394366197183099
2696568,1,B000KN7BN6,"Too terrible - even for the genre.  Dont wast your time, effort or money.  Take a nap instead, better time spent.",1396396800,,113,4.333333333333333
2696569,2,B000KN7BN6,"It could have been really good and suspenseful with some work, but it was pretty much what was expected and I had the plot figured out almost immediately. OK..if you have nothing better to do.",1393459200,,192,4.514285714285714
2696570,3,B000KN7BN6,"Interesting controversy here over this film.  I have to say I couldn't stop watching.  Was it because of the Cowboy, who was so sexy, or because of the dumb plot?  Not sure.  Did I mention the Cowboy?",1392336000,,200,4.324324324324325
2696571,1,B000KN7BN6,"Poor acting and juvenile script.  A predictable and slightly steamy farce using sex as the primary draw.  Keep on looking, save your money.",1391644800,,139,5.0
2696572,2,B000KN7BN6,"Poor cinematography.  Plot was different.  Characterizations were poor at best.  Not the worst film I've seen, but not one I would recommend either.",1390780800,,148,5.3478260869565215
2696573,2,B000KN7BN6,"Nothing about this movie really makes much sense. A married middle aged man (who's really gay) brings home a young man he's tricked with to be his house boy. Can you imagine how well that goes over with his wife, come on now. It's just so stupid and poorly acted. You just have to watch it to believe it, LOL.",1388880000,2,309,4.166666666666667
2696574,1,B000KN7BN6,Bad acting.  No...........  Horrible acting.  I wasted over an hour for that?  Do not waste your time or $$$$$.  Even the plot wasn't that convincing.,1385251200,,150,4.84
2696575,3,B000KN7BN6,"I was rather disappointed in this movie, other than the glorious body of James Michael Bobby as far as I was concerned it had nothing going for it",1365206400,,146,4.25
2696576,3,B000KN7BN6,"Granted, the house was garish with disgusting colors and frilly lamps. Granted this was not Streetcar. But I disagree about the acting... much better than in Brokeback Mountain, folks. If you gave it a chance, the performance by James Michael Bobby was nuanced, sensitive, sweet and vulnerable. He has... unfortunately... gone off the radar because of relentlessly negative reviews like the ones we've seen here. The reviewers don't in any way strike me as experts or cognoscenti [look it up]. They sound like the typical type of person who has failed and wants to blame their shipwreck on everyone else. If anyone knows how to locate Mr. Bobby, please put that in a review. I have a screenplay with his name on it. No screen test required. He's another Brando, but the Archie Bunkers of the world want his head. Sad! Just like Romney's 47% crack.",1354752000,,847,4.808219178082192
2696577,5,B000KN7BN6,I love this kind of story.  I fell in love with the husband as soon as I laid eyes on him.  Remarkable story bout a married man that has a secret from his wife.  It's a bitter sweet story.  I would highly recommend this movie.,1344297600,,226,3.9555555555555557

8158386,5,B000KN7BN6,GREAT MOVIE!,1410307200,,12,5.5
8158387,5,B000KN7BN6,"I recommend this one because it was unusual and had a dark side I wasn't expecting. If left me thinking on many levels. Some of it should have been cut when editing but fast-forward was enough to keep me watching AND I'm glad I did jeep watching.
I could watch again and get still more out of this one but it got to me so I'll wait awhile first.",1406332800,,345,4.0144927536231885
8158388,5,B000KN7BN6,"I understand being married and falling in love with another guy.  I divorced my wife of 16 years because I could no longer live a lie - that I am a gay man who married to appear normal.  I have three children, now grown and have accepted their gay father.  They have helped me come to terms with my gay self.
At age eight my love of men's body started. From that point on  I never looked at women the same way as I looked at a man.
Cowboy Junction tore into me because this could have been me had I stayed married. This is one of the movies  that I will remember for the rest of my life.",1404777600,,587,3.899159663865546
8158389,1,B000KN7BN6,"Not worth watching. The first 5 minutes will make you think that. From the moment the ""supposed"" sex happens in the car to how the fight started, bad bad bad.",1403049600,2,158,4.3
8158390,2,B000KN7BN6,"This is a film that tries to be a crossover. It's trying to appeal to the straight and nonstraight audiences simultaneous and it succeeds as being good for neither. In 1970, Michael York and Angela Lansbury starred in ""Something For Everyone"" with the same kind of feel, only that film, directed by Hal Prince had a sense of humor. ""Cowboy Junction"" is deadly serious and unfortunately deadly boring. A less successful 1968 movie with the same idea was Teorema starring Terrance Stamp as the handsome stranger able to seduce anyone in sight. I don't recommend ""Cowboy Junction.""",1402876800,,578,4.969072164948454
8158391,4,B000KN7BN6,"Not the best and certainly not the worst of what I have seen. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but I will say I was completely blindsided by the last major plot twist. It wasn't a waste of time, certainly, but some of the production values weren't the best (e.g., scene so dark the ""acting"" couldn't be seen). There were moments that were just a little stilted, but they were more than compensated for by the hot, hunky Cowboy (James Michael Bobby).",1400544000,,468,4.390804597701149
