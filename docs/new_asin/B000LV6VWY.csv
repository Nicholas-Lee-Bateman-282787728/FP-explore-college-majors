8164447,5,B000LV6VWY,I have the complete series and the Aston volume measures up to the standards of the Jaguar and Ferrari volumes.  I thought the Porsche volume was the weakest of the set.,1507248000,,169,4.451612903225806
8164448,5,B000LV6VWY,This was a great story of this exceptional company.  With the changes of ownership it was amazing it made it at all.,1362441600,,116,4.2727272727272725
8164449,5,B000LV6VWY,Most of the Victory by Design videos are great and worth picking up. This one is full of great cars and sounds. The sound mixing DTS is great on a 5.1 system. I will say the Ferrari and the Porche episodes are still my favorite but this is good as well.,1361577600,,253,3.980392156862745
8164450,5,B000LV6VWY,"Why is it that no one in America (where, presumably, there are more car nuts than anywhere) can make good videos/DVDs about cars as good as the English can? Great quality and in-depth subject matter research combine to make this a great view for Aston-Martin fans - especially with winter fast approaching when most of us need to put our toys away and just dream of driving nice cars for a while! Covers the complete history of Aston-Martin with excellent examples of all periods of cars shown - and driven hard! Send the wife and kids out for the day and turn up the volume!",1317686400,,575,4.485714285714286
