7864406,4,6304176996,I liked the video. I teach 6th grade and we have done tectonic plates & volcanoes. It was a fun review for the students and they could enjoy the cartoon as well. I would recommend it.,1268006400,,183,4.111111111111111
7864407,5,6304176996,"The Magic School Bus never lets me down! As a preschool science teacher, I use these videos to supplement what we are learning about. The little ones love MSB and request to watch them over and over again. In this video, they explore volcanoes and eruptions. The scientific language is used correctly and they illustrate each point in ways that children can understand. Two thumbs up for MSB!",1175731200,,392,4.779411764705882
