8113842,5,B000ERVKNK,2nd Gig is one of my favorite series. I love the storyline and the major is awesome. I've always been pleased by the animation. Even if it doesn't follow the manga to the letter.,1374883200,,178,4.264705882352941
8113843,5,B000ERVKNK,"As a fan of Ghost in the shell and other Anime, this collection is on par to my Ghost in the shell collection. The condition of this dvd is very good and the pricing was very reasonable. an excellent choice.",1364256000,,207,4.2
8113844,5,B000ERVKNK,"The first two episodes of Volume 5 are a little bit uncharacteristic of the usual Ghost in the Shell emotional range. In episode 17, the Major travels to Taiwan in search of more info about Kuze, but instead surrenders to her maternal instincts by stepping in between a teenage boy and a local gang war. The next episode features Batou as the main star as he and the Major are taken away from the Kuze case to help an international effort succeed in nailing an infamous terrorist bomber. Batou begins to become attached to a young handicapped girl who mysteriously seems to be looking right at him, even when he's in camouflage mode, which should render him invisible to the naked eye. Even though Kuze was a member of the Individual Eleven, which wanted to drive all refugees out of Japan, it seems he's switched sides now, and is the main driving force of the rapidly escalating insurrection of the refugees. When Section 9 gets wind that Kuze wants to get his hands on atomic weapons, the stakes get dramatically higher!

This series gets better and better, even outshining the first season since 2nd Gig is dealing with an issue that is really upfront and center in the US right now. If you've made it this far, then you'll know just how amazing the writing is on this show. Even after all the years spent with these characters, you can still find nuances in their reactions and be charmed that no matter how mechanized their bodies become, their ""ghost"" still remains and makes them human, even the Major, whose body is full prosthetic!  The art and animation is the best I've ever seen in a TV anime, and you have to marvel at how they pulled off the budget to make it. Classic stuff.

Extras: Interviews with Japanese voice actors who play Motoko, Batou, Togusa, Borma, and the director Kenji Kamiyama.",1150848000,,1809,4.629283489096573
8113845,5,B000ERVKNK,"I'll start by saying all those people who think that american animated series are as good as it gets animation wise have been living under a rock since this series started 11 DVDS ago, and it continues with this volume. As for the episodes themselves, They were a good addition to the season because with the next two discs, everything comes to a head and resolves. Looking back on the four episodes, the only perceivable problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything that was going on at home in Japan. This was not enough for a point deduction. At the end of the day, anyone who likes a good series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this discs and all of the discs from both seasons. You will not be disappointed.",1149206400,3,810,4.442953020134228
