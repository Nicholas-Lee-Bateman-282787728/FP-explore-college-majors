1726748,2,B000068QL8,"I wasn't bothered by ""Extremely Dangerous'"" obvious borrowing of a central premise from ""The Fugitive."" It was the lack of suspense and surprises that got to me. I expected a thrill ride of a movie, but it never materialized over the long 3-hour 20-minute DVD.

Obviously, the script is the greatest weakness here. In terms of suspense or mystery, it is a total flop. None of the clues amount to much, you can see the supposed plot twists a mile away, and the villains are easy to spot.

The worst part was how the scriptwriter got the protagonist out of scrapes -- much like an old-time serial, there is even a scene where he dives into the water and is surrounded, seemingly without escape. Then, fade out. Fade in to Sean Bean back at his apartment. How he managed to escape is never shown or explained!

What I assume was the lack of much of a budget seems evident by other odd choices. In one scene, a skyscraper is said to be burning to the ground, but instead of seeing any part of it, we're told about it (with the sound effect of sirens in the background). A low budget is not always a liability, if it spurs creativity, which was not the case here.

What might have made this bearable -- an interesting main performance -- is not forthcoming from Bean. He exhibits no range or subtlety. That leaves the interesting bits to supporting actors -- in particular, Nitin Ganatra as a Pakistani cab service operator. His scenes crackle, but little else in the movie does.",1058054400,14,1474,4.50936329588015
1726749,4,B000068QL8,"Extremely Dangerous is a 1999 British suspense thriller starring (and indeed created for) Sean Bean (Sharpe, Catherine Cookson's The Fifteen Streets, James Bond's Golden Eye).  Bean plays Neil Byrne, a man convicted of the horrific slaying of his wife and child at their home in Manchester.  Having spent a couple of years in prison, Byrne has been granted a transfer to a different prison.  It is during the train journey to the new prison that Byrne manages to escape, jumping off the train.  Now a fugitive, Byrne (who claims to be innocent) returns to Manchester, ostensibly to discover what really happened and who set him up (and why), and it is this process of discovery, together with the curve balls, pit falls, twists and turns that occur along the way, that comprise this 200-minute story.
The opening sequence (ie. the escape from the train en route to a prison) and the initial premise (ie. a man accused of slaying his wife and child) is very similar to that of the Harrison Ford film entitled The Fugitive.  Whether or not the rest of the show is in essence a remake of The Fugitive or not, I cannot say, as it's been years since I saw the latter film.
With a mix of gangsters and government agents, in addition to the police, this is a suspense drama with a good storyline (of which I shall say no more, as I don't wish to give anything away).  It requires close attention, as there is some subtlety in the method of presentation, with the viewer occasionally having to make connections that are not explicitly spelled out for him or her.  Even with close attention paid, it is still a series which benefits from repeated viewings.  The series is split into four 50-minute episodes.  Initially, I watched it over four evenings, but I strongly suggest viewers watch it over no more than two evenings (at most) in order to keep the characters and plot straight.
Apart from Sean Bean, the show also stars Juliet Aubrey (Catherine Cookson's The Moth, Bertie and Elizabeth) as Annie, the daughter of one gangster and girlfriend of another.  Though this is a drama, there is some welcome comic relief (of a very dry and ironic nature) provided by the Pakistani owner of a mini-cab agency (played by Nitin Ganatra) with whom Byrne finds employment.  Personally, my favourite scenes are those between Bean and Ganatra.
All in all, this was an enjoyable mini-series, and it is certainly worth checking out if you're a fan of suspense drama in general or of Sean Bean in particular.",1022976000,76,2488,4.709677419354839
7964748,5,B000068QL8,Fast paced and very well acted. (It helps to have read a synopsis to sort out the characters.) Leading roles are very well done and several minor characters superb. This is an action film that can be watched over and over - the denouement does not spoil subsequent viewings.,1505692800,,274,4.612244897959184
7964749,4,B000068QL8,Good movie.,1476748800,,11,5.0
7964750,5,B000068QL8,"Very well done.  Fine acting, solid story line and overall well done. If you love a mystery and cheering for the underdog, go for it.",1354492800,,133,4.32
7964751,1,B000068QL8,"This movie promises a lot and it delivers... sort of.
  For anyone who is interested (as I was) what this film is rated, it is definitely R.  I bought this movie reluctantly because I couldn't find it to rent or discover what it was rated.  I hoped for the best, but was disappointed by all of the unnecessary bedroom scenes of which I think there were at least four or five.
  The principal character Neil Byrne (Sean Bean) is intriguing and the storyline keeps you guessing as much from the twists as from the barely intelligible British accents.  As a study of British accents it is interesting.
  Everyone in the interviews raved about the female lead, but I thought she was kind of deadpan and uninteresting.  Sort of like Julia Ormond in Sabrina and First Knight.  I think that the Indian cab driver made the scenes in which he appeared seem more human and less contrived.
  I can't remember if the soundtrack was any good which is saying something, because I normally have my radar on for that sort of thing.
  The action/fight scenes are pretty cool, but I had to laugh at how the hero is portrayed whenever he gets back to his apartment: Shirtless.  This fact alone makes the point of the movie quite obvious.  This isn't an enduring classic that causes you to better yourself.  It is simply another piece of crowd-pleasing trash that appeals to one's emotions and senses by turns.  There is no elevated sentiment to be found in this film unless it is that of Neil's desperate search to find out what happened to his loved ones.
  It was a complete waste of my limited time and so, rather than inflict my DVD on someone else, I believe I am going to throw it away.",1348704000,,1673,4.4916943521594686
7964752,5,B000068QL8,"I bought Extremely Dangerous on the basis of two things...I like Sean Bean as an actor, especially when one can get him out of the rut of villainous roles, and the recommendations on Amazon.com.  I have watched it several times and enjoyed it each time.  Mr. Bean gives a great performance, the movie clips right along. The acting in roles large and small are excellent, especially the Pakistani taxi dispatcher.  I have advised others to buy this movie and they have enjoyed it too.  The story line is excellent and yes, it reminds one of The Fugitive, but only on the surface.  I would prefer a tish more resolution in the ending, but I can't overly quibble about it.  I would highly recommend this as one of Mr. Beans best works.",1277337600,3,732,4.549618320610687
7964753,4,B000068QL8,"Great movie. Although not as fast paced as many action movies and it does have similarities to ""The Fugitive"" I enjoyed it. If I have one small complaint it was the accents and colloquilisms are so thick at time I had a little trouble understanding it. I actually would have liked the option for subtitles, unfortunatly for the hearing impaired as well this is not an option. This is a bare bones DVD. It is a long movie and a little editing may have trimmed the runtime but I was never disappointed in the acting or story. Fans of Sean Bean should definitely catch it. Decent quality DVD, no extras, reasonable replayability.",1212796800,4,626,4.598214285714286
7964754,3,B000068QL8,"This was a British TV mini-series, and feels like it!

None the less, it isn't bad, with the characteristic English understatement.

It is good value, as it is long, and not available on R2 DVD. Turn off the brain, and enjoy it for the action.",1176768000,,243,4.377777777777778
7964755,5,B000068QL8,"got this because it has Sean Bean in it.  and a lot of his better work in on region 2 dvd, my dvd player is only region 1.  It is an excellent movie over all.  The acting is excellent all the way around.  We totally enjoyed it.",1168387200,,227,3.765957446808511
7964756,5,B000068QL8,"Well-written, fast-paced thriller, and very well-acted -- all the characters, not just the ""stars"", have depth and dimension.  One of the best-made tv-movies I have ever seen.",1162684800,4,175,5.481481481481482
7964757,5,B000068QL8,"This movie was a very enjoyable surprise. I bought it mainly because I adore Sean Bean and I had heard that this role was actually written for him. I was expecting to see another formulaic thriller (albeit with great scenery), but instead I was treated to an entertaining and intelligent four-hour film. As I said in the title, I consider it the thinking man's Fugitive - same general idea but with so much more depth. I'm ashamed to admit that while I'm on my third or fourth viewing I still don't completely understand all the British accents and some of the finer plot points, but that's okay. This is one movie I plan to watch many, many times. Extremely Dangerous is one of a severe minority of movies that treats the viewer like they have a brain in their heads (gasp!). It doesn't describe everything in minute detail. What a refreshing change from all the summer blockbusters that repeatedly beat you over the head with plot. This movie also is heavy on the characterization. No one-dimensional characters need apply! Neil Byrne, the protagonist, is especially appealing for his multiple layers. This is a man who can do some pretty ruthless things but he still manages to walk that fine line between good guy and villain. I liked the way the characters related to each other in realistic, and often funny and touching ways, without ever striking a false note. Overall, I gave Extremely Dangerous five stars because the writing and story were just superb. Sean Bean does his usual excellent job, not that I would expect anything less. He is entertaining and believable as a man so conflicted and tormented by forces he has no control over. This movie should be required viewing for everyone who calls themselves fans of Sean Bean in particular, or just fans of well-made thrillers in general. Five stars!!",1096502400,59,1813,4.777070063694268
