The part with the astronauts are also very interesting and I  would recommend this movie to any person interested in space!",968457600,,279,4.872340425531915
7881043,4,6305004072,"I'm glad to say that the full six episodes of this fine series are finally available, **though not on the first 1x disc edition of this release**, which is now unavailable. Seek out the re-release. There have been many documentary  series done on the subject of space exploration over the years. But few  have done it better or covered all bases like 'Space Age'. Producer Greg  Andorfer and writer Gary Hines are to be commended for creating a series  that will not date very quickly and will inspire people to look to space  with fresh eyes. It was a real coup to get one of Science Fiction's leading  lights to narrate and present the series. Real space uses fantasy space to  take back some of its' turf! Patrick Stewart has one of the most beautiful  voices in the English-speaking world. His narration is clear, enthusiastic  and endlessly engaging. The writing is concise and refreshingly clear of  technobabble and the use of special effects and music is slick and  competent. Archive space footage from the 1950s to the 1990s are of  excellent quality. And one thing is made abundantly clear: We need series  like 'Space Age' to help turn mankind away from the insular, navel-gazing  flat-Earth tendencies and to help focus us toward a better future. The  exploration and eventual colonisation of space has been budget-strangled  and hobbled by political ignorance for too long. As the first episode of  this series clearly shows: MARS AWAITS!",947116800,27,1452,4.885245901639344
