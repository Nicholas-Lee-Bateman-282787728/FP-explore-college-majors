8584978,5,0935621318,"I'm practicing Mantak Chia's healing tao for about a year, I'm doing the microcosmic orbit, chi kung I,II,III and before that fusion I(which is a must, don't try to start with this one before you've learnt the previous one).
Because this is not a moving technique, I think a book would be better.
Anyway the video is good, Mantak Chia's English is a bit hard at start (subtitles would be great), but after a few minutes you can learn to understand thai English.
About the technique itself, I've continued to it right after finishing fusion II, and the feeling I had the first time I opened the bridge and regulator channels was quite strong (and good).
The technique is a bit different since now it involves accupressure as well as energy manipulation.
Master chia is showing each point along the way and talks about it's good and bad influences.
I highly recommend this video, if you thought fusion II was something, you're up to a big surprise.
