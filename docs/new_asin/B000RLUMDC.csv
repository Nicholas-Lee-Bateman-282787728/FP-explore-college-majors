Watch this if you love unintentional comedy, awful acting and furious ""hacking"" on laptops that aren't even on. Also its free on YouTube. Save your money! I give it one Neil!",1470700800,2,352,4.603174603174603

8207074,1,B000RLUMDC,"I have watched this movie and it starts with 20+ minutes of Neil Breen in the desert bragging about how he is a super computer hacker, how he has created lots of dangerous bioweapons (with zero laboratory equipment to achieve this task), how he can survive only on cat food, is hunted down, has an invisibility force field that kills anyone that comes near, and drones on and on. Later on we see his bare butt, his girlfriend (now that's a stretch) shot in the back (she then suddenly floats face down in the pool and then Neil floats face down with her for no logical reason), and don't worry if you've missed this scene, you'll see it all again dozens upon dozens of times later.

If you wanted to watch a movie written by an adult man with the intellect of a 4-year-old child, well then, this is your flick.
It is no where near as fun as the ""AXE COP"" online comic series. ""Double Down"" is just plain awful.

You'll get to see lots of shots of Neil Breen making more boastful proclamations about himself, lots of bland line speaking by random strangers that are never named or ever heard from again. Those are the high points of the film, by the way, the rest of it is not entertaining or even interesting. You will see lots of random stock footage establishing shots which never pay off.  The film has some ""action"" moments of Neil Breen grabbing a duct-tape back of a powder claimed to be ""Super Anthrax"" after he pokes it open, but nobody dies and that's it. Seriously.  Near the end, all of the medals that Neil Breen claims to have earned for his super-hacking skills amount to 8 medals on shirt. Yep folks, only 8 important medals in the entire world so don't dare try to ever earn more than that.",1329004800,4,1706,4.389240506329114
8207075,5,B000RLUMDC,"Neil Breen's ""Double Down"" is truly a movie that leaves more questions unanswered than answers given. The story of Aaron Brand, a rogue agent who can control the national geo-spatial agency's satellites, ""DD"" excels at the disposition of exposition above all. There are moments of true terror and mourning, such as when Brand's lady is shot by a sniper in a public pool, only her nude-colored g-string to protect her modesty. Brand's anguish is palpable; in a moment both surreal and telling, he aspires to oblivion, floating face down in mirror image to his slain fiancee. A double assassination of two newlywed couples later in the film seems to point toward a larger theme: this world Breen has created is one without nations or social order, in which the bonds of matrimony, like any other contract, cannot be trusted. Paranoia and confusion drive Brand to seek the solace of dreams, where he meets his slain love, his childhood self, and an old man with the gift of fool's gold. Or is it? The trickster mineral seems to be the only thing that Brand can rely on, giving him the power to carry on with the love that still lives in his heart. Also, it gives the power to cure brain cancer, he thinks. This is a film which must be experienced by anyone who cares about life - on the surface it may seem to be a conspiracy thriller, but the real conspiracy is love.",1183939200,19,1365,4.575510204081633
