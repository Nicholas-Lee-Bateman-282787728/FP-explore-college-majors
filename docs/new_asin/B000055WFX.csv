1393497,5,B000055WFX,"This movie is way better than the crap they put out now.  It actually has good acting an an original story, and non-generic actors. The movies they put out now in this genre are non descript and generic quality, you can't really tell one actor/actress from another.  This film also has good scenery and good music, so it's the full package if you like quality stuff.",1375142400,4,366,4.53030303030303

On a full screen tv, there will be bars on the top and bottom of the picture.
On a widescreen tv, there will be bars on all four sides, if you set the
Picture Size to 4:3 to view the movie with the proper aspect ratio.

Depending on the player and the tv's capabilities, you may be able to
choose a Picture Size that will at least eliminate the bars on the sides of
the picture - while preserving the proper aspect ratio.  My widescreen tv
will only do this, via picture size 'Zoom1', if the tv video input is not HDMI/1080,

1393500,5,B000055WFX,"this movie is a wickedly funnie movie, just as you thought it couldent get any more amsuing, something else grasps your attention in a pleasant twist. BUY THIS MOVIE",1097971200,3,165,4.724137931034483
1393501,4,B000055WFX,"Tim Daly's understated, warm, charming, womanizing veneer shines through in this richly entertaining indie. Paul Lazarus, director of many memorable ""Friends"" and ""Mad About You"" episodes, tackles his first feature film here, yet it never really feels like a TV movie.  Although his tearful outburst on Mimi Rogers' doorstep was a bit painful to watch, few of Daly's acting limitations come to the surface in ""Seven Girlfriends,"" partly because it's the perfect role for him.  But, the real stars are the women he ""revisits"" on his path of self-discovery.  First stop is his first girlfriend, played by Rogers, and all things are not as they first appear.  As the uncomfortable discussion unfolds, you really begin to feel for the characters and the movie hooks you.  I am a huge fan of ""High Fidelity"" and comparisons seem almost inevitable, but this film is not the same.  It is far from acerbic, but far from sweet, too.  My guess is that more guys can relate to Daly's understated charmer than to John Cusack's brooding slacker. Though ""Girlfriends"" is hardly brilliant like ""Fidelity,"" it's still a nicely told little tale of soul-searching.  While the story almost begs to be nothing more than a nonstop collection of cliches, the skillful dialogue and actors keep that from happening.  I think that's what I like most about ""Seven Girlfriends"" - during my entire first viewing, I kept thinking I shouldn't like this movie, since it's not exactly loaded with original ideas, yet everything is executed here with a realistic, understated elegance that I just didn't expect.  I'd call it a ""guilty pleasure,"" but it deserves to be more.  NOTE TO MOVIE BUFFS: The DVD has some interesting commentary by Daly and Lazarus that brings to light many interesting problems in making a low-budget movie.",1074470400,9,1799,5.003355704697986
1393502,5,B000055WFX,"I first saw Seven Girlfriends on HBO late at night while on a business trip - then rented it to watch with my wife as soon as I got home. Even better the 2nd time. A very funny yet insightful movie about relationships and why they work and why they don't.
The coolest thing was - about 1/2 through the movie, Melora Hardin and Tim Daly sit down at the piano and Melora plays and sings - no unseen strings or flutes or harps in the background - just Melora, the piano, and her wonderful voice. Absolutely a top-10 of all time scene in a movie - dynamite.",1012867200,11,553,4.12962962962963
1393503,5,B000055WFX,"Paul Lazarus has brought together an outstanding ensemble of actors and given them three-dimensional characters and crisp dialog to work with, creating a film that feels like it's filled with your own friends and acquaintances.  Spend an afternoon or evening with it, and you'll want your own copy so you can see it again with a friend.",994896000,15,336,4.894736842105263
1393504,4,B000055WFX,"This movie list will never make an AFI list, but it is charming.  The story of a man who is dumped and loses his greatest love (2 different women) within a few minutes, prompts our ""hero"" to hit the road and meet his exes and learn where he failed.  Shades of High Fidelity, but a very different little film--it is not profound or wickedly funny.  It is kind, sweet, and gentle.  Sure, you can see how the story will turn out, but the journey is a nice way to spend 100 minutes.
Tim Daly, an actor I've never loved,(some one in America watched Wings for 8 seasons--not me) does a great job as Jesse.  He is flawed but decent guy who you can't help but root for.  I adored the cast, some biggish names, and many not so big, but faces you will remember.  Laura Leighton is the true love and she shines.  She is beautiful and makes you wonder where she has been (it seems she had child recently).  The cast features nice and warm performances from Mimi Rogers, Lindsay Sloane (in the worst writen role in the movie--she is a much better actress than allowed to be here), Elizabeth Pena, Katy Selverstone (she has been Drew Carey), Jami Gertz (who is always a pleasure).  Olivia D'Abo does a decent job (but continues her string mediocore films--will Kicking and Screaming be her high point?  That outstadning film just might be).  Arye Gross is solid as Roman, the best friend.  Gross never hit it big, but fits his role well.
My favorite performance is by Melora Hardin.  I recognize her from many things, but then looking at the filmography, I see movies like Labamda which I've never seen.  No matter.  She steals the film.  The scene she shares with Daly at her apartment is gentle and sweet.  Paul Lazarus, director, should have done more with this talented actress.  You can't help but fall in love with her when she sings.  I hope her career takes off.  She deserves it.
Enjoy this little movie.  It is sweet.  Share it with someone you love or to give you a bit of hope if you are alone.",992390400,16,1992,4.412087912087912
1393525,4,B000055WFX,I enjoyed watching Tim Daly in Seven Girlfriends. He was wondering why none of his past relationships worked out and started asking his past girlfriends.  Tim Daly is such a believable actor which is why I watched this movie in the first place.  He ends up with the girl I thought he should be with.  Also see him on TV in Madame Secretary.,1478995200,,340,4.365079365079365

More: Elizabeth Pena, who always illuminated the depths of human experience in her artistry-- to see her again was to miss her once more.
Actually, in this movie of vignettes there was not one actress who failed to shine.  The lead, Tim Daly, has a warm likability; he seems like a person one would like for a friend.

1394086,5,B000055WFX,"I hadn't seen this fine little film since it hit cable TV just after the turn of the millennium. I loved it then, and  I'm happy to discover that it holds up just beautifully as one of the best romantic comedies of maybe the past 20 years, Tim Daly plays a late-to-grow-up guy who decides to find as many of his ex-girlfriends as possible and query them about why he can't sustain a relationship. As directed by Paul Lazarus and written by Stephen Gregg, the movie is consistently surprising and entertaining -- funny, charming and believable. From the manner in which Daly's character cooks food to the various exes he encounters to a small role by the late, great Kathleen Freeman to one of the loveliest songs (Anywhere the Wind Blows) to be heard in a movie in years -- everything works and comes together to provide the kind of delightful experience audiences crave but rarely get. Don't miss it.",1473292800,2,901,4.63125

Is he smart enough to know who the best fit is?  Each person he dated was different and he was different in each scenario.  Becoming wiser with age is NOT an old wives tale.  Each romance was a learning opportunity.  Learning about yourself.  Maurity brings different needs and expectations.,1472860800,,462,4.592592592592593

(I have liked Olivia d'Abo in Alias and the Wonder Years, and she was also artificial.) How his other costars acted opposite him, I do not understand. I am so glad Melora Hardin went on to more challenging roles because she was totally wasted in this waste of my life. While Laura Leighton was utterly bewitching, the scene with the photos at her mother's house was beyond tasteless. Not because I am a prude who doesn't enjoy raunchiness, but because it was poorly done and simply not funny. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1503792000,,660,4.462809917355372
