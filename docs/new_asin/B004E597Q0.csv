4335922,5,B004E597Q0,"I wasn't really interested in taking a Birth Class at the Hospital because my husband was on a Business Trip and i didn't wanted to take it by myself. Watching labor 101 gave me a good idea about everything and when he comes back he will be able to watch it, too.

Labor and Delivery DVD
I enjoyed to see the different couples with there experience. The relaxation wasn't such a big issue for me until I heard the one couple talking about their different experience between the first labor without a preparation and the second one with a relaxation preparation. In my first order this DVD had a problem to run but got replaced immediately.

All about Labor CD
the Audio CD is a good supplement to the DVD.

Relaxation & Pain CD
I am practicing the Relaxation Techniques and feel how I am getting relaxed everytime I am doing it. Have the CD on my Ipod ready to take it with me to the hospital hoping it will do wonders during delivery. What I like about it is that my mind is focused because I have someone talking me through it.",1305936000,6,1029,4.321243523316062
4335923,2,B004E597Q0,"I was not satisfied with the content of the video. I was expecting a class with details and lists of signs of labor, the phases of labor, descriptions and definitions, medical interventions, etc.  This video was theoretical and mentioned things like hypnosis and relaxation techniques but did not describe them; it only indicated that you can take a class on these things.  In addition, my biggest problem with the video is that there is too heavy of a male point-of-view and too little of a mother's point-of-view.  Expectant dads might appreciate the video since it might be supportive of their role and be reflective of their feelings.  In addition, I was expecting unbiased information and felt that there was mostly criticism of mothers deciding to use pain medication.  I was especially bothered by one dad that refused to get the doctor for his wife to have an epidural because he felt that without pain medication is ""how nature intended it.""  This bothers me cause a woman should have a choice, and woman are not primative animals... We have modern medicine without which many of us would die during labor... We perform many ""unnatural"" medical procedures to save lives and always use pain medication.  I would like to see that dad have a colonoscopy without sedation!  I really wanted to understand the medical details of labor and even epidurals, but this video just gave some anecdotes and too many male opinions.  The only good thing in the set is the relaxation CD; it put me to sleep many nights.",1302134400,5,1511,4.825581395348837
4335924,4,B004E597Q0,"This DVD is helpful for those of us who are preparing for labor for the first time! It gave me a much better understanding of what to expect and how to better prepare myself. It provided tips and personal opionions of different options that are available during the labor process that were helpful in creating a game plan for my own labor exerience. I can't say that it's the most entertaining video I've ever watched, but it was helpful and educational. I would recommend it to first time mothers AND fathers preparing for labor and delivery.",1295049600,,543,4.666666666666667
4335925,5,B004E597Q0,"Really diverse group of medical professionals provide a great combo for getting a universal idea of how everyone involved is affected by birth.  In a class setting you obviously get the childbirth educator perspective and they interpret for you what the doctors, midwives, or nurses take on things are but this allows you to actually hear it from the horses mouth so to speak.  The midwife and OB were conspicuous spokes people for this type of dvd, but the assortment greatly enhanced the overall effect on me.

The professional I revered the most is the older doctor who is the Pediatrician on the panel.  He addressed how the baby is impacted by the various choices and situations in birth.  It was refreshing to hear a professional who gives you the low down on what's actually happening to the baby and what's best for the infant.  You notice two extremely contrasting settings of infant care immediately after birth.  I'd never thought about this before and it really made me think about what I want to have happen.

Extremely Eye Opening.",1292976000,13,1045,4.798882681564246
4335926,5,B004E597Q0,"Even if you've taken a birth class this set covers so much material you'll learn something new.  There are so many angles the obstetricians and childbirth educators toss around. You get the impression that each professional is sharing candid data based on their field of expertise and experience.  It's difficult to contend with information gathered like this.  There are no extreme opinions one way or another.  You learn from the mistakes of others without them telling you what you should do.  I never felt like I was being lectured.  I would say it's an intellectual experience for expectant moms and dads.

You learn what to expect and how to deal with the multitude of scenarios that can occur in labor including emergency childbirth.  I was grateful that there were no fear tactics used when it talked about the different possible outcomes associated with labor and delivery.

There's also a segment on the physicality or athleticism of birthing.  I never really thought I should ""get in shape"" for labor before.  The movie compared birth to running a marathon.  I really felt like I needed to be a little more involved and committed to my preparations for a healthy labor.

The Relaxation & Pain Management CD explains the tension, pain, fear cycle and how it affects you during contractions.  There are a lot of different options considered for coping with pain and some of them weren't for me, but there was a big enough selection that I could settle on something effective.

Overall I'm very pleased and will recommend Labor 101 to friends.",1292630400,11,1551,4.888888888888889
4335927,5,B004E597Q0,"I've found these discs to be very informative and great at answering all my questions, including ones I never knew I had!  The Labor and Delivery DVD was especially helpful, covering all the important things a couple needs to know, to prepare for when the baby arrives.

Speaking as a Dad, the birth process is so amazing to begin with, and this DVD treats it in a way that is encouraging and respectful, as well as being practical and even entertaining!  (The live birth footage is shown very tastefully, and it really conveys the emotional payoff of having a baby.)

I heartily encourage anyone who is pregnant, or even considering having a baby to take advantage of this wonderfully useful product!",1292544000,6,701,4.768595041322314

4335939,2,B004E597Q0,"We purchased this DVD to show to our mothers to be.  In reviewing it it was our opinion that this DVD is definitely geared to very educated women.  One of our reviewers was an OB nurse with 10 years experience and she found it to be confusing.  Our other reviewer, a Maternal Health Educator thought that the DVD was not produced in laymans terms that most of her clients would understand.  We wish this item was refundable due to the fact that it does not meet our needs at all.  We would not recommend this to any mother to be in the future.",1421020800,,543,4.233009708737864

4335942,4,B004E597Q0,"This set did a pretty good job of preparing us for our birth.  We were under the impression that it would contain more birthing instructions/guidance, but was more like an in-depth discussion about how the birthing process works and what we could expect.  It was helpful to know about the phases, why pain in birthing was necessary, and how to set up a birthing plan, but it did not provide much help with labor or breathing techniques the way a ""Hypno Babies"" class might have done.

The production quality was good, with lots of video of births in progress and interviews with professionals in the field and couples who have recently had a birth experience.

While not an outright replacement for a birthing class, it certainly did a good job of helping us set reasonable expectations for our birth.  If this is your first birth and you are unable to attend birthing classes, then I would recommend this product.",1410307200,,914,4.723270440251572

4335944,4,B004E597Q0,prepared me for everything I needed to know for my first baby it was informative and very clear. made a nice alternative To an actual class since I didn't have time to attend any of those,1400976000,,187,4.222222222222222
4335945,3,B004E597Q0,"It's been a bit hard for my husband and I to get a video that will tell us exactly what to expect, because we are having twins. Taking a course isn't compatible with our schedules, so we jumped in and purchased this and one other video: Laugh and Learn About Childbirth. We watched this one first and found it decent but we still had a lot of questions at the end.

One of the most frustrating aspects was her focus on natural, medication/intervention free childbirth. I respect women who can - and do - do this without interventions. As I am having twins, the likelihood of me finding any birth expert to assist me in natural childbirth is really, really low..... And I'm frankly not interested. So her repeated focus on this kind of childbirth, with just a shrug and a glance at other kinds, was frustrating.

Another annoying thing about this video was her ""credentials"". Because she has had several children, in several different ways, she made a video. To me, that isn't quite what is needed. She showed a lot of pictures and clips from her own deliveries, as well as a few others, but again the focus was on natural birth and it wasn't entirely helpful to see pictures of her being calm and meditative at the hospital.

If you are on the fence between this video and the Laugh and Learn video, then go for the Laugh and Learn. It overed everything this one does and so much more.",1398384000,,1385,4.466403162055336
4335946,5,B004E597Q0,"This worked so well! The instructions were clear and concise, which made them easy to follow. I would listen to it with my husband, and after doing this several times, he became a pro at coaching me. At the hospital, he would talk me through the same techniques we used to listen to in the dvd. I was able to go for 10 hrs of labor with no intervention, other than hubby coaching me. I had back to back contractions with pitocin running the entire time, if this helps to understand how effective this was. The only con (just joking) is that it worked so well, I was never able to get past a certain point of progressively relaxing because I would fall asleep without fail and not hear the end part of it (during practice runs in the weeks leading up to delivery). I fully intend to listen to this again with any future pregnancies.",1396051200,2,831,4.333333333333333
4335947,4,B004E597Q0,"It was definately helpful as I couldn't afford classes at the time. I had a friend as a doula, and that was the most beneficial. Get a doula!!! If you can't, this set helps prepare you a bit. Good luck mommas!",1391040000,,209,4.121951219512195
4335948,1,B004E597Q0,More fluff and opinion than I expected.  Same information repeated over and over.  Wanted something more clinical in nature.  Would not recommend.,1389052800,2,146,5.545454545454546
4335949,1,B004E597Q0,"The description provided about this product is not only misleading, but downright inaccurate.  I was initially drawn to this video as an alternate to a birthing class because it claims to have a scholarly approach, and to ""empower astute parents with the most comprehensive and objective birth class available on dvd.""  I also appreciated that the author had delivered both naturally and medicated, because I was (and still am!) curious about my options.

This video is more accurately described as a series of highly subjective testimonials about natural birth being best.  The amount of information was incredibly disappointing, especially since the promise of a scholarly approach through each stage of labor was a major reason I purchased the dvd.  I expected a step by step break down of what to expect, starting from signs you're in labor (real contractions vs. braxton hicks), through each step of labor and delivery, and ending with various scenarios parents might encounter once their child is born (i.e. apgar scores, will the baby need to be incubated, what is the healing process like after delivery, etc).  While this video does interview 2 doctors, a midwife, a sports life coach, and two different couples, each individual or couple showed a clear preference for natural childbirth.  For a product that claims to be objective on this matter, it really missed the mark.  It avoided the clearly taboo topic of an epidural almost completely except when listing the negative side effects it can have on mother and baby.  At least ONE testimonial from a couple that had chosen to have a medicated childbirth would have helped provide a clearer understanding of one's options during labor.

I also found the interviews too male-based to be of much use.  While Dad is a obviously a huge and important part of the birthing process, when it comes to how a woman endures the pain or utilizes various relaxation techniques during childbirth, it would be much more meaningful coming from the woman who actually birthed the child.  I also found myself enraged at the husbands who refused, and even flat out lied to, their wives who were begging for an epidural.  I'm happy they could stick to their birthplan, but I think we can all agree some of us out there might never be able to forgive our husbands if they did that!

My personal birthplan is this: have a healthy baby.  Whether I am able to make it through without medication, or I choose the medicated route, a healthy and happy baby is what matters most to my husband and I.  In my opinion, the author of this video could focus more on helping expecting couples achieve exactly that, rather than waste their time and money by providing only one perspective to this amazing, life-giving process.",1382572800,6,2754,4.890322580645162
4335950,4,B004E597Q0,The labor 101 birth class was very informative yet slightly boring. I guess I was hoping to see a little more on live births- and maybe some exercise moves to prepare for delivery. The cd's are great for relaxation and breathing techniques and I have recently copied both onto my iPod to have with me for the BIG day!! I would recommend it to a friend.,1372032000,,352,4.348484848484849
4335951,2,B004E597Q0,"I've had a very busy last few weeks at work trying to wrap everything up for my leave and couldn't find classes that work with my schedule so I thought this DVD would suffice. There are some great elements to it, but some basics aren't covered, that ""Labor 101"" content I was hoping for. It's also very non-intervention based. I didn't buy the dvd to make a decision what type of intervention I wanted. I wanted to know what to expect from the experience in order to decide what kind of intervention I might prefer. The accompanying cds for pain management and relaxation for the most part are not what I was looking for. Long, monotone imagery stories about a powerful white light healing your body to your amazement and knowledge of it's power... um... not likely going to convince myself of that. I'm doing a lot of last minute reading and internet scouring for the elements of Labor 101 that this doesn't cover. Also, the presenter has seemingly hundreds of pictures of herself with various withdrawn gazes during labor. After awhile I found myself wondering why there are so many of these odd pictures and not more content. Maybe it was to show how relaxing and uneventful labor can be???",1365465600,,1193,4.658767772511848

4335953,5,B004E597Q0,This DVD is wonderful in explaining the stages of labor as well as giving relaxation tips for natural labor. Its very informative on what is to be expected when entering a hospital for a baby's delivery. They use couples to tell their experiences and decisions with their labor. The dvd also shares different options people can take when its delivery time. The relaxation techniques they talk about mostly focuses on breathing and positive thinking. It also talks about distractions and support from the husbands. This will definitely help if your trying to go natural.,1363132800,2,569,5.0638297872340425

4335955,2,B004E597Q0,"I agree with the review written by Maggie - 'Useless, no detailed information'. I didn't learn much from this DVD or the accompanying CD's. It might be useful if you want to use the relaxation techniques in the CD to practice if you are sure you want to have a natural labor. The DVD mostly was interviews with couples on their experience. I learned more from the DVD 'Laugh and Learn About Childbirth' with Sheri Bayles and would recommend that instead.",1361232000,2,454,4.617283950617284
4335956,4,B004E597Q0,"I was going to use this in place of taking the in person birthing classes, it convinced my husband and myself that we needed to take the class!  The breathing techniques on the audio CD really helped durring my delivery.",1361232000,,220,4.5
4335957,5,B004E597Q0,My husband learned a lot from the video. I like that every type of birthing experience is discussed and every step of the labor process is explained. The CD has a lot of great relaxation techniques and it is actually stuff you remember to use during that stressful time.,1360886400,2,270,4.530612244897959
4335958,2,B004E597Q0,"The DVD does not clearly go through the stages of labor or is particularly informative at all. The DVD emphasizes natural labor, but, again, does not go into any detail of relaxation methods in an organized fashion -mostly conversations with couples who had gone through other birth clases.  By comparison, the Sheri Bayles ""Laugh and Learn"" DVD was great (or the free ones on line).  Don't waste your money.

....I have to edit my review now having gone through labor. Even though I found the Cd with relaxation methods trivial while listening before labor, they stuck with me during labor and helped me have a natural childbirth experience. Still not worth the $$, but provides a different type of preparation.",1358208000,2,712,4.916666666666667

my first baby. I had the desire to do a natural birth, without any
medication, but was trying to keep an open mind that if I ended up
needing something, that would be ok too. Anyway, I watched the video
multiple times, as well as listened to the two audio CD's that came
with it repeatedly on my way to and from work. And...I was able to
give birth totally naturally  to a healthy, beautiful, amazing little boy. I really feel that the preparation from
the video and the information given on the audio CD's were a huge part
in helping me do this  I had debated taking a class somewhere,
but opted for the video since I could watch it over and over in the
convenience of my own home and on my own time. So much of what I
learned from the video and CD's came to mind while I was going through
the labor process and it was a truly positive and empowering
experience for me. I didn't feel scared, I felt like I knew what to
expect and had many ways to get through the contractions calmly and without tension. It really played
a huge part in making my birthing experience a positive one.",1351555200,2,1152,4.184684684684685

I bought this for my niece who is will be a first time mom and I am so glad I did. It has a lot of basic information in it that covers labor from start to finish. There are many things that one might not think of, so this is a good way to prepare.

I found the presentation of material even handed. It didn't seem to be salesy or pro natural or pro drug-assisted childbirth. The presenter (Rasmussen) was fine, but I would have liked it better had the photography focused on more than just her talking.

It had some good info about epidurals, which you can just google and get at mayoclinic or other good websites for free. I found better relaxation and breathing information on Youtube. We also got a 1980's Lamaze DVD at the library that had better birth info, if a little outdated.

I loved the boxed set so much.  I contemplated not even doing any pre-birthing because it was so expensive and did not fit into my schedule.  Then I found this boxed set on amazon.

4335982,2,B004E597Q0,"I wanted an educational DVD that would take me step-by-step throught the labor and birthing process. This DVD did discuss each stage of labor and delivery, but mainly focused on how to cope with each stage if you are having natural child birth. The DVD did not feature any couples or video footage of couples that are choosing to have an epidural. My husband and I found the DVD to be boring, and not that helpful.

If you are not going the ""natural"" route, then I would definitely find an alternate DVD.",1329696000,,504,4.478260869565218
4335983,2,B004E597Q0,"The Labor and Delivery DVD was decent but the presentation by Becky was painful to watch.  It felt so rehearsed that it was hard to follow what she was saying, not to mention really distracting.  The content was decent and I learned from watching her DVD, plus the interviews were good but it's not a good sign when you have to keep pausing the DVD because it's so boring that you have to get up and refresh your brain.  Plus I'm not a fan of audio books and the All About Labor and Relaxation & Pain Management are basically that, and so boring to listen to.  You're better off reading a book yourself about those topics.

I preferred Sheri Bayles Laugh and Learn Labor and Delivery version, is a bit basic and could have been expanded on (and a bit cheesy), I'll admit, but she kept it real and it was like talking to a real person.  It wasn't read off a que card or rehearsed.",1329264000,,879,4.265060240963855

4335989,4,B004E597Q0,"I like this DVD so far, very instructional.  I personally did find the section on epidurals to be rather long and I definitely got the impression that the instructor is pretty opposed to them.  It almost made me think that it would be better to drug my baby with narcotics (through drugging me) during labor than take the epidural! I have a hard time believing that - it seemed more like the instructor knows that more people choose the epidural so decided to spend more time making it sound scary than narcotics, which most people try to avoid, anyway.

But other than that, the techniques described and the two supplemental CDs are very nice and well-done.",1314835200,,658,4.655172413793103

4335991,4,B004E597Q0,"As a mom of 4 who HATES pregnany but loves the outcome I would highly recommend Labor 101 and Labor and Delivery to anyone pregnant or thinking of having a child. Let's see where do I start?  My husband did not have the paitience to sit through natural child birth classes. He thought they were slow and monotnious.  These CD's cover everything and help you completely prepare.  I didn't make it to a full natural delivery like I wanted due to a few different issues but being prepared makes a HUGE difference.  These CD's have real live couples, doctors and midwives sharing their stories and expertise.  You can't get that for under $100 let alone $30 anywhere these days.  I was extremely ill during my pregnancy and relaxation became very important. I think everything you need is on these CD's and you and your partner can watch, learn and practice right in your own home at your leisure!  Beats sitting in an all day class or a 6 week course!!

4335993,1,B004E597Q0,"I watched this DVD when I already finished reading 5 books about pregnancy and labor and also watching and enjoying "" Laugh & Learn about Child birth "" ( which I highly recommend. It is way more useful and fun to watch). So may be that is why I did not find anything new, exciting or especial about this DVD.
I also find the pp who made this DVD are against medical intervention such as Epidural and I find that very subjective.
Over all, I did nt like it and I did nt learn anything new.
I would say just go to your local library and get  Laugh & Learn about Child birth.

The DVD provides a great deal of information from Rasmussen (Certified Child Birth Educator) as well as medical professionals. Also you get to hear from others who've been through the experience which helped form my own vision of what childbirth can be like. Nothing about the techniques in the video are forced, i.e. your are provided with information to make your own judgements and decisions. I didn't feel bad once in watching the video about considering labor/delivery options. The CDs are helpful, particularly the one about Relaxation to get a run-down of different methods. Good buy!
