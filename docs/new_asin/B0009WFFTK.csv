2327619,5,B0009WFFTK,"My all-time favorite Cub while growing up. He should be in the hall of fame, but a championship ring evaded him throughout his career. I think this is the reason the veterans committee has stiffed him all these years.
This DVD is his heartfelt story that was put together by his son. It is a touching one, as the man deals with the pitfalls that go with diabetes to this day, but continues to be an outstanding spokesman/inspiration for this horrible condition. I bought this as a present for my dad (I had already seen it in a theater when it was first released) who also deals with a milder form of type 2 diabetes, but we don't want him to get any worse. We hope this story inspires him to keep his diet in check.

God bless Ron Santo and his son Jeff for bringing his story to light!

Thanks, Rockin Ron",1234310400,2,807,4.26797385620915
2327620,5,B0009WFFTK,"Ron Santo should have a special place in every Cub fan's heart.  Beyond that, this documentary should remind all bseball fans what the game is really about.  Very few players these days exhibit the love of the game more than Ronny.  In a day when money rules where players want to play, Santo shows how one man can truly love the city he plays for.  This film proves beyond a doubt why Santo belongs in the Hall of Fame.  It proves why Santo is the greatest Cub fan in history.  It proves that no one bleeds Cubbie blue like Ronny.

Outside of the baseball context, this movie shows the power of the human spirit and a man's will to not only survive, but to inspire others to do the same.  The footage of Ron coping with what diabetes has done to him will move even the most stoic person to tears.  It is hard not to well up throughout this movie.

An essential for Cub fans, an essential for baseball fans, and a heart-warming story for those who just want to see the power of human will.",1190073600,6,989,4.240641711229946
2327621,2,B0009WFFTK,Incredible determination by an athlete who honors the sport of baseball.  His heart and guts are beautifully portraid by his son and is a tribute to a courageous Dad--an inspiration to all who may be tempted to give up a quality of life threatening struggle. Hurray for Number 10 and his loving family!,1171152000,,302,4.69811320754717
2327622,5,B0009WFFTK,"I purchased this DVD for my husband, a true blue Cub fan. Ronnie's son did a fabulous job on telling his father's baseball and post baseball life story. His story is so inspirational. It is amazing to see all that he was able to conquer and all that he has been able to accomplish given all the odds against him due to his diabetes.",1169251200,,332,4.203125
2327623,3,B0009WFFTK,"Ron Santo was a baseball player's player. Like many of those he played with, he played hard. Like Cincinnati Red Sox great, Pete Rose, he played when hurt, for the love of the game. Few players deserve the Hall of Fame as much, and few men have extended themselves for the sake of others as Santo.

Now, years later as a Cubs broadcaster, his passion still flows through. As he has suffered from diabetes, losing both legs, he has used his position and celebrity to promote awareness of diabetes. Few celebrities in sports have been as hard-working, as committed to the sport and the fans as Ron Santo. He gets it, and appreciates every moment he is has been involved in baseball.

Unfortunately, being a great guy doesn't mean his story will be as great.

I want to like this film more. I grew up watching Chicago baseball. While he retired in 1974, before I was old enough to enjoy him as a player, I have spent years listening to him as a broadcaster. Ron Santo is a Cubs and a baseball legend.

A combination of poor storytelling and poor editing are the culprit. I feel as if I am watching a collection of rain delay clips halfway into the sixth inning, not a well-told, well-produced story of a man's life in baseball.

The story seems to wander from ""I love Chicago, baseball and the Cubs,"" to ""Life is tough with diabetes, but I will press on"" and back again. Not bad, but it is hard to feel as Santo feels. The passion that thrills listeners to him on the radio is not transferred.

We are treated to interviews of celebrities and sports stars. It is nice to see a more relaxed side of people like Dennis Franz and Bill Murray, both unabashed Cub fans (and terrible ""Take Me Out to The Ballgame"" singers!).

It is not a horrible film. Santo's story is strong enough to carry the weaker spots, but it is better saved as a future MLB Hall of Fame media item (Santo has been a shoe-in for years).

2327624,5,B0009WFFTK,"I was surpised to find this movie selling here at Amazon.com, and I see older custmor reviews of this movie, so they must have been selling copies here for a while, and I just never thought to check here, but it is nice to see that the movie, has gotten a wider release on dvd/video, this movie opened in limited release and the end of the Cubs' 2004 season, in which copies was for sale at Wrigley Field, Bernie's and Thisoldcub.com, I bought a copy of the movie autographed by Ron Santo, that was sold on a first come first served basis, and since they have had more copies since then that have been autograped. Jeff Santo (Ron Santo's son) directed, and produced this movie, we see Ron Santo at Wrigley Field, Arizona, or the hospital that he spent when he had his remaining leg got a brusie, and needed surgey for removal, and to this day he has to wear fake legs, that he has to put on when he gets up. The movie takes place in 2003, right after he had to have his 2nd leg removed after a brusie, and his family and him, decided to go with the surjey to remove his other leg, that was remainnig. The movie is narrated by Joe Mantegna, and their are intreviews a clips of famous people, and people that work in Chicago, or the Cubs, Bill Murray, William L. Petersen, Gary Sinise, and Dennis Franz are a few actors that are seen in intreviews in the movie. There is a clip of an intreview that Ron Santo did an intreview with WGN Radio morning host Spike O'Dell, and WGN Sports Director Dave Eanet. Former Chicago Cubs TV broadcasters Chip Caray, and Steve Stone has intreviews in this movie, Pat Hughes' Ron Santo partner on WGN Radio 720 games, is also intreviewed for this movie, the movie takes place in the 2003 season, in which Ron Santo is up for the Hall of Fame, by Veterans' Committe, in which that players that have been retired for 15 or more years, that has to be elected in by this commeittee that so far has not elected players in the Hall of Fame. There are interviews with longtime Hall of Famers lke Joe Morgan, Ernie Banks, Todd Hanley and even Ron's roomate during his player days Glenn Beckertt. Without giving any more away, this is a great doucemenry put together by Jeff Santo, there are all sorts of music put in here like Gardan Party, I Get Around, and I Walk the Line. This would be a great movie to own, or even to give as a gigt, to any baseball, Ron Santo, or Chicago Cubs fans, the movie runs 91 minutes long. The movie even played in limited release in theatres, openning, and played in theatres most of the Cubs' 2004 season, the film openned in select theatres in Chicago and Arizona, and so came got got released wider, I am glad now that there are servel places where you can find this movie, I even go out and call it a must own, so please buy this movie, for that fan, or even for yourself, and even share it with your family & friends.",1125014400,2,2878,4.292279411764706
2327625,5,B0009WFFTK,"People may look at this and think that it's just for Cubs fans (Which I can proudly say I am one).  It is not the case.  Whether you are a Cubs fan, suffer from Diabetes, are looking for a hero or want to see a film about a man who has overcome so many obstacles and never asked ""Why me?""...this is your film.  It is simply beautiful.  Jeff Santo did an excellent job with the film.  You will laugh.  You will cry.  You will stand up and applaud.",1122681600,5,446,4.0
2327626,5,B0009WFFTK,"This film chronicles Ron Santo's battle with diabetes (which has taken both of his legs), and also his quest to be voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Both storylines use celebrities and baseball players to tell the story of Santo and his impressive career as player and Cubs broadcaster.

But what the film is really about is Santo's undying positive attitude about his health and the Cubs. It's an inspirational story to anyone, and particularly those who have dealt with major health problems.

For die-hard Cubs fans like myself, it's a must-see. For anyone who enjoys documentary films or inspirational stories, This Old Cub is a great pick.",1121731200,9,648,4.935779816513762

I had the pleasure of meeting RON a few times in recent years and he deserves a film like this and should be in the Hall of Fame.  THIS OLD CUB is NOT just for CHICAGO CUBS fans...it's a film for everyone BUT if you like Baseball or know people suffering from Diabetes or suffer from it yourself, you will like the film that much more.

2327642,2,B0009WFFTK,"They focus more on his having diabetes and not his career. I would have liked it more if they showed him playing or discussed his career with the cubs.
 They touch on his time with the cubs as a player, but I feel spent too much time showing him sitting in a wheelchair waiting to be seen or when his legs were removed.
I did not even finish watching it, because it made me sad and uncomfortable. I wanted to see a baseball great who could deal with an ongoing illness and see how his time as a ball player was the strength of his life. Instead I felt I was staring at a guy who while strong, was nearing death and missing his better days. I think it could have been done much much better.

You may see it differently. I just was unhappy I spent the money.",1358294400,3,756,4.067114093959732
2327643,5,B0009WFFTK,"I am a dedicated Cub fan, patiently waiting for their first world series victory before I pass on.
And watch this excellent movie quite often. Earlier this week, my wife, who is not a baseball fan, watched it with me and was very touched by Ron's positive attitude and determination, even while losing one leg and then the other to diabetes. This movie is for both fans and those looking for a real profile in courage.

The movie does an excellent job of following Ron through the disease and therapy and the pain of it all.
He very often smiles and even jokes with those around, but the movie even catches the times when he is tired, or just cranky --having a bad day.  So you get to see him fighting hard to be upbeat and just loving to spend time with his little grandson. And a few other times when it just gets a little too much.

And then there is the Baseball Hall of Fame. The movie takes us up to the next announcement of those selected, and the hopes of those watching, including Ron. Finally, he gets word that again he did not make it.

That prompts one of the real inspirational points in the film ---when he is selected for the Chicago Cubs and his flag raised at Wrigley Field. He tells the fans that having the Cubs honor means even more to him than getting a spot in the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame. My eyes always get a bit tearful at that point.

There is also coverage of Ron's career and how he focused on the Cubs when it came time to start his major league career. And how he played, and played hard, everyday, no matter what.

This is a great movie about a real hero, both on and off the field.
Enjoy!

2327644,5,B0009WFFTK,"What a shame that the HOF could not see fit to induct this man and give him what he earned while he was still alive.  Old Satchel (A_ _) Butt to some was a good guy and a tremendous ball player.  I can recall like it was yesterday, playing catch in Marty Novelli's backyard in River Grove with Ron Santo and Jim Brewer back in 1963.  I still have my autographed picture of Ron Santo to Jim.  You watch this documentary and you truly understand who this man was and what made him tick.  It's a shame he is not in the Hall.  I hope to be there to witness the day he is finally inducted.",1318896000,,584,3.9913793103448274
2327645,4,B0009WFFTK,"The outpouring for Ron Santo following his death was a tremendous tribute to the man and to Chicago.  Many know him only as a former player and broadcaster; I had the good fortune to watch him play.  The diabetes story is important and compelling, and an exclamation point to his Hall of Fame case.  But truth be told, diabetes or not, Santo and Brooks Robinson were the dominant third basemen of their era.  A superb fielder and team captain by the time he was maybe 24, here's the guy who batted cleanup for a team with Billy Williams and Ernie Banks on either side of him.  This film shows the man who bleeds Cubbie Blue, the one with great heart, willpower, and eternal optimism -- qualities on full display as a broadcaster.  Santo the player had something else, though: tremendous skills and talent right from the start.  Turn off the sound and you can see a major league presence throughout the game and throughout a career.  Strong, agile and smart, Santo had a great glove, terrific hands and a cannon to nail the runner at first from the edge of the infield.  Not the speediest baserunner, he did have great range from in front of the bag to the hole between short and third (Don Kessinger, too), the leader of an All-Star infield with the double (and even triple) plays to show for it.  Nobody surpassed his grit and determination -- I was at the game in the middle of a 20-something hitting streak when he was badly beaned and had his cheekbone fractured (the ear flaps you see on batting helmets now are a result of that incident).  The question on people's mind was how long he'd be in the hospital, not how he'd continue his hitting streak.  But damned if he didn't return within a day or two and pick up right where he was.  Incredible talent, dedication and seriousness of purpose are what today's fans won't know from his time in the booth, and what this film doesn't fully show.  But it does show the man.  What a man.",1294704000,2,1937,4.463068181818182
