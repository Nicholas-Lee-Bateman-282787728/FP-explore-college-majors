8313477,2,B001JQHT3K,"I borrowed these DVDs from the library and watched a little of the first one and fast forwarded the rest to make sure it's just as bad.

This is supposedly a 2009 product, but the video and animations look like they are from the 80's. The bigger problem though is that there is no English translation, so if you don't already understand what they are saying in the videos, you won't learn it by watching them. On the back of the DVD case they say the DVDs have English subtitles and a booklet (accessible in a computer). Unfortunately this is not true! There are no English subtitles (only Spanish subtitles) and no booklet. Also, note that they speak with Castilian, not Latin American accents.

These DVDs may be of some use to someone who (1) already knows some basic Spanish, (2) is interested in learning specifically Castilian Spanish, and (3) would like to practice speaking the language by repeating what they say in the videos.",1262217600,4,936,4.666666666666667
8313478,1,B001JQHT3K,"The presentation attempts to be cute by using animation. There is little english used and very little that can be used long term or that vould not be picked up watching ""Dora the Explorer"".

I was very disappointed.",1246060800,3,215,4.657894736842105
