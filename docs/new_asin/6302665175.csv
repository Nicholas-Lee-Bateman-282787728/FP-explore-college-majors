Colin Baker did extremely well considering the weak story and clearly defined the new Doctor's personality as much more brash and arrogant than any of the other Doctor's incarnations.

I did enjoy watching it and it kept my interest. Clearly it isn't the best story out there but it's far from the worst. The weak story knocked a star off my rating and the continuity errors knocked another off for a 3 star rating on this,",1473033600,,678,4.641666666666667

491074,2,6302665175,"This is bad, but I don't think it's qualitatively the worst episode of Doctor Who, though it ranks pretty low in the classic series (only King's Demons and Underworld were worst in my opinion.) However, it was probably the most ill-timed story as introduced a new Doctor after the old one had left in a blaze of glory in one of the best Doctor Who stories of all time, The Cave of Androzani.

The story is plagued by bad acting (particularly by the twins), non-sensical character behavior (particularly by Hugo), and horrific wardrobe design (and no, not just the Sixth Doctor's outfit) and make up, and a silly looking monster of the week.  Clearly the higher end Davison stories had pretty much eaten up the show's budget.

Still, what's good about the story is Colin Baker's acting  It's a tad over the top and the character is flawed, but by Episode 4, the Sixth Doctor had really established his character in a way that the Fifth Doctor probably didn't until a season and a half into his run. I also liked how Peri put the Doctor in his place in the first couple of episodes, really being the voice of the fans. The final scene was a nice touch. It would have worked better if this were kicking off Season 22 rather than leaving fans to stew for all those months. Still, watching on DVD, it's a good end that says the stage for what's to come.",1425772800,,1348,4.445344129554656

491138,1,6302665175,"Oh, Jonathan Nathan-Turner. Your reputation certainly precedes you. Sure, when you originally came on board during the Tom Baker era, there wasn't a whole lot to sneeze at. In fact, some of your changes you brought to Doctor Who worked for the better of the show. But during the era of Peter Davison, it became clear your grip on this show was tightening to the point where Doctor Who was becoming a full on strangle, where the show's face was turning purple, gasping for air and the voice begging you to let go sounded like a nasal duck. Alright, so you gave it a break with some air to breathe with ""The Caves of Androzani"", but then you grabbed it by the neck again and strangled it to death by hiring Peter Moffat to write the ultra-disastrous first story for poor Colin Baker.

Yes, I'm extremely sympathetic with Baker. His tenure was awful no doubt, but it was not his fault. First off, he wasn't allowed to wear his own outfit. He wanted dark clothing to reflect his darker personality and what did he get instead? A coat that looks as if ten clowns puked all over it, ironed on the puke and then proceeded to let it dry and congeal for ten days. I'm sorry for making you guys gag, but that's the only way to describe this awful coat. Who on earth thought it was even a remotely good idea to wear this awful outfit?! He was even a good looking chap back then too! And let's not forget that he was forced to act how he did. He wasn't allowed to interpret the Doctor his way, it was all the writers and producers' idea. The finest example featured is when he strangles Peri in a post-regenerative crisis. At that point, I took the disc out and threw it across the room on my first viewing. I did eventually make it all the way through this story but boy it did take time.

Oh yes, you did hear me right, post regenerative crisis. ""Again?! Just after Castrovalva?!"" you ask. Good question. Does every first story need to involve The Doctor going through a crisis?! In Castorvalva it wasn't that particularly good either, you had Peter's performance to even things out. And there, he did things that made sense, such as taking apart Four's scarf strand by strand. Here? Being violent and choking people. This was not needed at all and was a horrendous first impression. But the pain doesn't stop there. The titular twins a re a total joke. Never mind the fact that they can't act their way out of a paper bag and were clearly only hired because they were twins. Their Elmer Fudd voices are side splitting and ruin any intended emotion. ""I am Womulous!"" ""I am Wemus!"" And then there's the colour scheme of this episode that makes me want to vomit... Ugh.

I could go on but this just making me even more angry. Look, if you want good Colin Baker, go and listen to his audio stories, or watch ""Vengeance on Varos"". His audio stories are great because he plays the Doctor the way he wants to. If any of his stories were anything like ""Jubilee"", I guarantee you he'd have gone on to become one of the best actors on the show. True, NuWho isn't perfect but at least its cinematic nature covers it up; there's no such salvation here. It was shot on video in a studio with all its flaws on display for all to see. Avoid at all cost.",1417305600,,3229,4.369384359400998
491139,1,6302665175,"With any regeneration story, the main drive is to shift out quickly and get on with the adventure. That way the audience can see this new persona play out. This serial takes far too long focusing on the 6th finding is footing and it is not at all compelling. Colin Baker is a theatrical performer, however so was Patrick Troughton and Tom Baker. What this serial was missing in comparison to Robot or Power of the Daleks was balance. Nothing leveled out the manic Colin was bringing nor with the lethargic script to work from. His predecessor Peter Davison took a great deal of time waking about the Tardis in a fog but that was quickly dealt with and the story pace picked up. Dilemma lumbers along
The BBC was economizing and not much money was spent on this one and the script was out to capture the Douglas Adams serials without fully understanding the context of that humor.

491142,2,6302665175,"This is the introduction to the sixth Doctor (his first full story), as played by Colin Baker.

I don't mind bad (wobbly) sets, or poorly made up monsters; after all, such would hardly be unique for this Doctor Who adventure.

What I do mind, terribly, is the havoc wreaked upon the character of the Doctor.  Other Doctors have shouted at companions and have been angry with companions.  Companions are, after all, far younger than the Doctor's 700+ years, and they are under his protection.  It was a TERRIBLE idea to have the sixth Doctor attempt to kill a companion!  Regeneration is no excuse.  It was too much - it left a terrible impression of the 6th Doctor that never entirely went away.  I have no problem with making a change from the fifth Doctor - making the Doctor tetchy; fine.  But he has been a decent person, and, barring the earliest shows, he has been someone to admire.

And then there is the clothes.  I can see a maladjusted mind selecting the hideous clothing.  But by the end of the show, or the beginning of the next, when he had (supposedly) settled down, he should have ditched the hideous clothing for something a bit more toned down.  Granted, the Doctor's clothes have been always been a little offbeat, but this was just too much.

Colin Baker may be a wonderful actor, and perhaps there was a plan in place to get better over time, but it doesn't make up for the above.",1311897600,3,1401,4.507936507936508
491143,1,6302665175,"This was a real disappointment as the first story for a new Doctor (Sylvester McCoy got an equally bad regeneration story with Time and the Rani).

It had some good ideas such as The Doctor's instability and the appearance of a fellow Timelord but it was all let down by horribly conceived and executed villains, the laughable new costume for Baker (which the producer, John Nathan-Turner, as he did with Davison, insisted be worn as an unchanging 'uniform') and the unbelievably whiny faux-American companion Peri. A mess from start to finish. This was a very bad start for the Colin Baker era from which the show never fully recovered. The contentious relationship between the Doctor and Peri got so mean-spirited on the Doctor's part that it was painful and grating to watch.

However, Colin Baker's first full season still produced some entertaining shows, despite Peri and the costume.

491216,4,6302665175,"Colin Baker's debut has an interesting plot, despite it being rather unscientific and outlandish.  Colin Baker makes a decent 6th Doctor, and Peri's dedication to the man who changed before her eyes is unquestionable.  Nicola and Colin both give great performances.  However, there is some definite padding to the story where the main cast is trapped on Titan 3.  The set designs were actually more decent in this, and the model work was really well done.  The overall look of the serial was good, although the slug design of Mestor could have been so much better.  The acting performances varied from excellent to mediocre, and I am not sure the twins selected for this story had much experience with acting.  Still, this is not nearly as bad as most people have made it out to be since it is very entertaining.  The sound design was dreadful, especially for the slug's movement!  If the soundtrack was changed and a new slithering, slimy sound was created it would make the story a bit more enjoyable to watch.  Episode 4 is probably the best as the Doctor defeats Mestor, and shows his true compassion when he helps his friend Azmael.  The story for me was exciting when I was younger, but looking at it now I am able to see the flaws.  Still, the DVD is worth getting due to the commentary track with the main cast members, and the extras on any Doctor Who DVD are worth getting.

That being said The Twin Dilemma was not in season 22, nor was this the best episode of Colin Baker's tenure as the doctor.  This is the only Dr. Who episode that I have fallen asleep through every time I have watched it, which includes the time I taped it in the 80's.  I only bought it because I am a hardcore fan and completist.  If you are looking to just get into classic Dr. Who I would recommend titles such as The Caves of Androzani, The Green Death, The War Machines, or The Genesis of the Daleks as good starters.  If you want to check Colin Baker out then get Vengeance on Varos first and work from there.

491219,4,6302665175,"As a recent fan of the revised Doctor Who I have been going back and collecting stories from the original series as I had the money to do so.  Purchasing ""The Twin Dilemma"" was based mostly on it being the first story for 6th Doctor Colin Baker, which makes it an important milestone for Doctor Who.  After watching it I read some other reviews and comments here and on the Who Wiki and it became apparent to me that this is one of the most hated stories of Doctor Who, but I must say I enjoyed it through and through personally.

Most of the negative comments seem to come from the 6th Doctor being rather insane in his debut, violent at times and rude and narcissistic quite often.  This is explained as a side-effect of regeneration, a particularly tough regeneration according to Who lore, but it seems to have set the 1984 audience spiraling as they were not used to such a brash Doctor on their TV screens.  Watching this in 2010 though with the benefit of knowing Who was not changing forever it can actually be quite enjoyable to see a different kind of Doctor, one who needs some training to once again become the hero we know him to be.  I know from watching later 6th Doctor stories like ""Mark of the Rani"" that Colin Baker's Doctor becomes more traditional later on, so why the hate for this honest attempt at drama on behalf of a 20+ year old series?  Sometimes a shake-up is a good thing.

The real issues with ""The Twin Dilemma"" are rooted more in the insanely stupid plot of the main villain, a giant slug alien named Mestor.  Without giving much away I can tell you his motivation and scheme is so ridiculous and impossible from a scientific point of view it makes the last episode a real eye-roller as they talk about this possibility seriously (not to mention the fact his goal could be achieved in an endless number of more practical ways).  The entire story is littered with small and large continuity questions such as why the villains need a ship when they can teleport across the galaxy, why they make a pit-stop on the asteroid The Doctor is on when they have no real need to do so, plus many other issues.  Still if you can get past these flaws or explain them in your own mind outside of the show's dialogue, which is what I do, you could find yourself enjoying the show regardless.  Baker's acting is very good as are most of his fellow actors, the villain, while looking silly like most DW villains of this era, is suitably evil and revolting, and the ending has quite a few great moments from Mestor's defeat to The Doctor showing some real compassion for a dying friend.

491221,4,6302665175,"Poor Colin Baker, the Sixth Doctor. Over the years, it appears that Baker, a fine actor, and, as far as I'M concerned, a fine Doctor, has become the Rodney Dangerfield of Doctor Who's---he don't get no respect at all (or, at least, not very much). It seems that the Sixth Doctor is not looked back upon with too much fondness for several reasons: his aggressive behavior/bad temper, his very loud wardrobe, and the violent nature of some of his first-season episodes---""Vengeance On Varos"" taking place on a planet where people watch ""video nasties"" on television, ""Attack Of The Cybermen"" with a main character's hands being crushed by a Cyberman until they bleed (though NOT graphically, unless the sight of fake blood makes you faint), and ""Revelation Of The Daleks"" with it's various deaths. Throw in an 18-month hiatus dealt to the ""Doctor Who"" series during Baker's tenure, as well as continuously sagging ratings, and you've got yourself the only actor to ever actually have been *fired* from the role of everyone's favorite Timelord (shame on you Michael Grade, the BBC controller at the time). The BBC then had the audacity to try to get Baker to come back for a final regeneration story so they could ""properly"" bump off his Doctor---Baker responded by telling the BBC to shove it, and rightfully so. Who could blame him? And now I've just read in Doctor Who Magazine that a recent poll the magazine took has named Colin's debut story, ""The Twin Dilemma,"" the all-time worst Doctor Who story ever, ranking a bottom-of-the-barrel #200 out of 200 stories. With the imminent release of ""The Twin Dilemma"" on DVD, it's time for THIS Sixth Doctor fan to come to the defense. I'll try to be brief:

I've always liked Colin Baker's Sixth Doctor. After Peter Davison's quaint, passive Fifth Doctor (though he was good, especially in his classic finale, ""The Caves Of Androzani""), I greatly appreciated that the Sixth Doctor was a tough, take-no-prisoners Timelord. Despite his tetchyness, I still admire the Sixth Doctor for his intelligence, his bravery, and his wit. Had Baker been allowed to play the Doctor longer than a mere two seasons, I'm sure he would've grown in the part even more, and shown us sides to the Sixth Doctor that we hadn't seen yet. Alas, it was not to be, but you can't blame Colin for that. Yes, the Sixth Doctor had a temper---not too unlike William Hartnell's First Doctor, in fact---but he was still a GOOD guy, fighting on the side of GOOD. And don't tell me that the Sixth Doctor never showed Peri any kindness, because he most certainly did. Yes, his temper would briefly flare up every so often, but he would always calm down, and he showed time and time again that he cared about Peri. His friendship with Peri had certainly grown by the time the events of ""The Trial Of A Timelord"" happened, so he obviously liked her. So there.

His loud, colorful wardrobe....I liked it! The idea of producer John Nathan Turner was to give the Sixth Doctor a whirlpool costume to suit his whirlpool personality, and I think it worked quite well. I never liked the question marks on the Doctor's collar, but JNT started that with Tom Baker, so JNT has to take the blame for that. However, I admit that maybe putting Colin Baker's Doctor in a solid blue coat (as he has been wearing in many recent graphic novels and audio drama artwork) may have been the right way to go. Still, don't blame Colin for the clownish coat!

Finally, the violent nature of some of the Sixth Doctor's adventures....I LIKED that the ""Doctor Who"" series had gotten tougher with Colin Baker at the helm. It showed that the makers of ""Doctor Who"" were not afraid to take some risks with the series. However, I still maintain that Colin Baker's era was not, I repeat, NOT as graphic as many have been led to believe. I've seen far worse things on TV then a bloodied pair of hands, believe me.

As for ""The Twin Dilemma"" itself, I don't believe for one single second that it's the turkey it's been made out to be. Okay, so it may not boast the greatest of scripts, and it may not be a terribly *exciting* story, but I still find the story entertaining enough, the characters interesting, the look and feel of it quite handsome, and the performances of the cast excellent, with Colin Baker's fresh, colorful performance as the new Doctor at the center.

Peter Davison, as good as he was, was at times a bit too soft. Davison also wasn't served well by his writers, who usually had his Fifth Doctor respond with ""I don't know"" virtually every time a companion asked him what they should do (and you know a Doctor is in serious trouble, writing-wise, when a companion seems to be more intelligent than he is---in Peter Davison's case, Nyssa). Colin Baker's Doctor was unashamedly aggressive, but so is James Bond, and you wouldn't want to mess with him, either. James Bond is still a good guy, fighting on our side. So is Colin Baker's Sixth Doctor. With ""The Twin Dilemma,"" Colin Baker showed that there was a totally new Doctor in town, and totally new in more ways than one. And I like him.",1256515200,35,5083,4.662207357859532
491222,3,6302665175,"O.K. Sixth Doctors Haters; Here is your last chance to throw stones at the Colin Baker Era of the classic series and I am sure you have all been waiting to trash this episode in particular. As a fan of Colin Baker's performance (and there are far more of us than most Dr. Who fans will admit)I say to you from the bottom of my heart... YOU WILL NOT BE MISSED! Oh and by the way, Of the doctors with the fewest possible DVD releases (Troughton 8, C.Baker 8 and McCoy 12) who crossed the finish line first?
  The review: Breaking from the show's tradition The twin Dilemma did not open a new season but in fact closes 5th Doctor's Peter Davison's third season. It deals with the newly regenerated and remorseful doctor's wish to become a hermit following his post -regeneration tirade that finds the doctor trying to strangle his new companion Peri. Fortunatly she fights him off but this scene is disturbing to say the least. Of course the hermit thing does not work out as the Doctor's hide-a-way on the planet Titan 3 winds up to be the safe house for two genius, kidnapped, twin, earthing boys who are pawns in a plot by an alien slug named MESTOR. Mestor's plan is to use the twin's genius to cause the sun of the planet Jocanda to go super nova thus spreading millions of tiny Mestor eggs throughout the universe. Long story short The doctor ""scrambles' To ""poach"" the plot before it gets a chance to ""hatch"".
  The Twin Dilemma has some good moments. Colin Baker throws himself into the role with gusto setting his portrayal apart from the previous doctor from scene one. Their is an excellant supporting performance by aging actor Maurice Denham who plays fellow timelord and freind of the 4th doctor (or so we are told) Asmale Edgeworth. There is also a noteworhty and ""ARCHY"" performence by actor Seymour Green as the Chamberlain to Mestor. The episode itself is brightly light and full of color (costumes,sets,etc.). There is a quick pace to the story  as we jump from location to loacation as each episode ends: Earth-Tardis-Titan 3-Jocanda. Where the episode loses focus is in the performances of the remaining supporting cast. I would rather not metion names in case they goggle their own names but they know who they are. Then there is the main 'badie"" Mestor who is just plain awful from design to voice. In a season full of poorly designed monsters (season 21)Mestor is one of the worst...I would say second only to that silly four legged thing (Merker I think)from the season opener ""Warriors of the Deep. The Twin Dilemma story line itself lacks a certain plausibility even by Doctor Who standards. Last and certainly least are the bird-like Jocandians. All I can say here is, ""Oh Boy. Not good"".
  In summary I would say buy it if you are fans of the sixth Doctor or like regeneration episodes. Skip it if you do not like the sixth doctor (don't get me started again) or if you only buy the best of the classic series. As for me I have this episode on pre order and will have my carot juice chilled come 1-10-2010. Has anyone seen my orange spats?",1253577600,7,3065,4.5618181818181816
491223,3,6302665175,"Now I have to admit that Colin Baker wasn't my favorite Doctor, but in many ways, it wasn't entirely his fault. He wasn't that bad. His performance in ""Attack of the Cybermen"" proved that. I think what made many fans, like me, hate his Doctor so much was producer John Nathan-Turner who tried so hard to make his Doctor so dislikable, starting with this story here. Not only did the Doctor try to kill Peri in this one (although that was due to a regeneration crisis), but he's also cowardly, grumpy, and selfish in this one too. It's funny how John Nathan-Turner was so worried about fans not liking Peter Davison's Doctor when he actually should have been more concerned about Colin Baker's. It was also stupid to end this story with the Doctor saying ""I am the Doctor, whether you like it, or not."" It was even more stupid to end a season with this story.

Now this story does have some good elements in it. The plot is actually quite good, and when Colin Baker does get a worthy part and some worthy dialogue to go along with it, he really does shine. Maybe not the best story out there, but it isn't that bad. At least worth a look at.",1238457600,,1140,4.352112676056338
491224,2,6302665175,"The story is not as bizarre as fan reaction to it! We have everything from someone who assumes that Eric Saward, who wrote Colin Baker's best story, is to blame for this, to those who think it is total genius, and everything else in between! Sheesh!
Amazing! How can I put this. This story is remarkable in that, which ever way you want to look at it, it is at least entertaining (then again, so was Plan Nine From Outer Space!)and Colin Baker, while pretty painful at times, is also very compelling and engaging a lot of the time. There is also a beautiful turn from the guest star Maurice Denham as Azmeal, a great, great actor who does wonders with the role.
The script is fairly poor, but contains some outrageous and memorable dialog. The game plan, to make this Doctor seem evil and unlikeable and then redeem him gradually, seems ok in theory but the realisation, having him try to throttle Peri, is really off-putting and many think it hurt the show big time. Here I agree, I met teenagers who hated it and thought it sunk the whole series. The slug villain is pretty poor and the production has a tacky look, with a tasteless costume and garish titles at its heart, too detract further. But it is compelling viewing all the same. I cringe at the Doctor being so twisted in parts, but overall, this is contrived, tasteless but hypnotic viewing. Not a flawed classic, but a shonky pantomine with an utterly compelling black heart. It points to the series it was going to become before Michael Grade interefered, a black comedy of the darkest, most garish variety, realised brilliantly in later Bakers like Varos and Revelation. Initially, I loved the costume worn by Colin Baker, but grew tired of it later. But what an expression of individuality in the face of robotic sameness like Cybermen and Daleks. The last true Doctor is malajusted and over the fence, tasteless and annoying at times, but still has something edgey and interesting to offer. If nothing else, watching this will make you be thankful for the tasteful Peter Davison era!!! Overall, it's a bad story with redeeming qualities and is worth watching. But it's not your regular Dr. Who story!",1085011200,16,2166,4.672774869109948
491225,4,6302665175,"Suffering from post-regenerative trauma worse than he did before (q.v. Castrovalva), he chooses as his new outfit a patchwork orange overcoat, yellow trousers with red stripes, a blue cravat with white polka dots.  He also sinks down amid his wardrobe and wails of the ""grinding wheels of the universe and the crashing boredom of eternity"" before breaking down into mad laughter, and to top it all, he attacks Peri.  Seeing that in regenerating he has become ""unregenerate,"" he decides to become a hermit in order to cleanse himself and pilots the TARDIS to the moon of Titan III, where by chance his best teacher, Azmael, has kidnapped twins gifted with mathematical genius in order to procure them for his master Mestor.
The Doctor and Peri also rescue Lieutenant Hugo Lang, space corps commander who was pursuing the twins along with his squad, of which he is the sole survivor.  After foiling an attempt to kill them by Noma, one of the two Jocondans assisting Azmael, they go to Joconda, once a beautiful forest world devastated by the attack of Gastropods, giant beings half human/half slug.
The new Doctor seems keen on denouncing his previous self, saying that he had a ""feckless charm which wasn't me.""  On an interesting note, when Peri calls him ""Doc,"" he brings up the memory of the First Doctor in ""The Five Doctors"":  ""Kindly refrain from addressing me as Doc, Perpugilliam!""  And his remark on becoming ""unregenerate"" forecasts the Valeyard in the Trial Of A Timelord season.
The new Doctor's outfit fits his personality fine, and Peri's plaid blouse is not bad either--it's Hugo's shiny metallic shirt that fits the epithet ""yuck.""  Heck, if I found an outfit like the Sixth Doctor's, I would ""go out like that.""
Colin Baker's verbal repartee is one of the reasons he was a successful Who actor, whether he is quoting from poets or rattling off words that silkily roll off his tongue:  ""I'm a knight errant, not an errant fool.""  Or how about this alliterative verbal attack on his assistant:  ""Poor pusilanimous Peri!  What a pitiful performance!""  Mentally wandering off is a ""mental stroll in the park of psychic tranquility.""  It's easy to see why John Nathan-Turner picked Baker to succeed Peter Davison.
His Doctor is very expressive, and unpleasantly arrogant, but beneath all that, beats two kind hearts, which is important in keeping in line with his personality.
Mestor resembles a furry giant snail with a cross-eyed owl-like face.  While his tone is menacing, the cross-eyes make him laughable.  As the Doctor tells him, ""In my time, I've been threatened by experts.  You hardly rate at all.""
And Gavin and Andrew Conrad as the Sylvest twins give a good performance as being rational, cerebral, but vulnerable.  Remus tells his father:  ""Just because she gave birth to us, does that automatically grant her a place in our affections?""  and that ""respect must be earned.""  Those familiar with Roman mythology know the reference to Romulus and Remus.
Not a bad debut story, although not as excellent as Spearhead From Space or Castrovalva.",1010102400,6,3065,4.94921875
491308,5,6302665175,"How dare you critcize the greates Dr Who of all time? This has to be a master piece. I love the over-the-top costumes, excellent dialogue and interesting music. Colin Bakers theatrical performance shines throughout the story, and its interesting to see how Peri copes whith the Doctors excentric outburts. The Jacondans makeup is amazing, the gatropods brilliant, and the XV-773 Freighter is very convincing. Ilove the seen where the Doctor is walking across a scorched, radioactive wasteland whilst reciting Longfellow. All Peri can do is scramble over rocks in High-Heel boots. The Sets are interesting, ranging from the symetry of the twins room to the Jacondan throne room filled with statues of giant frogs and golden insects. Azmaels performance is rivaled only by the doctors, showing his suffering, which makes the end scene where he dies (sorry to give it away) a truly sad moment. One thing I can't understand is why people criticize the twins performance, because they lack character. Don't you get it? They are supposed to be with out emotion, which is why you see them mature throught the story. Overall, The Beast of the Best, be sure to add this video to your collection.",980121600,7,1186,4.994949494949495
491309,3,6302665175,"I can not deny that the producer of this story wanted to try a lot of new things:
* New Doctor story before end of season (Twin Dilemma being season finale) * New Doctor being something of an anti-hero * Finding  actual identical twins for a story
Problem was, he did everything all at  once.  Colin's portrayal is best, with Davison being #2.  It's refreshing  to note that the Doctor is not human.  But introducing a new lead character  at the very end of a season, especially with such a risky element, usually  brings trouble.
That along with some horrible music, overblown comments  and actions by the Doctor, and all around bad writing, make this story  unpalatable.  Aside from Romulus and Remus (the twins, whose characters  were bad enough but then the acting...), the writing brings the show  down!
However, by the time we near the end of part 2, things start to  shape up and the Doctor becomes himself again - crusader against evil.  Larger than life and boastful, yes, but that in itself isn't bad.
Also  good was the relationship between the Doctor and Azmael - and that's  probably the only thing which keeps viewers intersted for it was those  scenes involving these two characters which felt natural and honest.  All  the others were contrived.  After all, 3 people go into the TARDIS wardrobe  and come out with with blindingly colorful outfits.  No, they're not  tasteless.  Just loud.
It's worth a viewing, but you have to stomach the  first 40 minutes or so.  Then it starts to improve.",956275200,3,1507,4.696153846153846
491310,1,6302665175,"OK, I will come clean at the very beginning. In 1984 I was not enamored with Colin Baker as Doctor Who. But before all you sixth Doctor fans click that you find this review unhelpful, let me assure you all that in recent  years I have warmed to him and appreciate his portrayal much more. But that  does not alter the fact that his debut story is an absolute travesty.  ""The Twin Dilemma"" is a shockingly bad production, with  disgusting giant slugs, dreadful costumes (although the Doctor's character  justifies his atrocious get-up), irritating music and awful acting  (especially from the twins Romulus and Remus, who could go down as the most  annoying characters in the show's history). The character of the newly  regenerated Doctor is also questionable. True, Colin Baker's Doctor is  irascible and arrogant, geared to make him more of an anti-hero, but  attempting to strangle Peri goes beyond the bounds of what should be  acceptable in Doctor Who. Even William Hartnell's Doctor, who was the  ultimate anti-hero (placing his companions' lives in danger so he could  satisfy his curiosity), was never as violent. The strangling scene is an  indication of the downward spiral into bad taste and unpleasantness that  John Nathan-Turner saw fit to inflict upon the series. But I digress.  ""The Twin Dilemma"" has no redeeming features. It has all the  hallmarks of a story that should never have been made. It is hardly a tale  that should introduce a new Doctor. Avoid it like the plague.",954115200,10,1494,4.908
491311,5,6302665175,"The Twin Dilemna is one of the most criticised Dr. Who stories of the show's run.  Why are so many so-called fans of this show appalled by this  particular episode and era of Dr. Who?  I think that this story and Baker's  performance are outstanding.  Many fans were shocked by the scenes where  the Doctor goes through bouts of insanity.  Many called this episode the  end of Dr. Who.  These are Tom Baker fans not Dr. Who fans.  I think that  the Doctor's actions in this story only add a new depth to this very  intriguing character.  Why can't the Doctor ever be portrayed as a dark  character?  Must he always be the childrens hero we all fell in love with  throughout most of the show.  On the other hand, I found Twin Dilemna to  have a great soundtrack, good actors, and great sets.  I know the  Gastropods are comical, but this is Dr. Who.  Many so-called fans say this  the worst era.  Many Georgians give praise to the new depth added to the  Whoniverse by this DIFFERENT approach given to the Doctor's character and  to the show itself.",941068800,6,1048,4.417989417989418
491312,2,6302665175,"There was a good story in here somewhere, trying to get out.  The only thing that could possibly explain this is that it was cobbled together from what was finished of the dying Anthony Steven's script.
As it is, the  twins (who are apparantly the reason this story was written) are almost  superfluous to Mestor's plot and manage to be quite annoying to boot.  The  only reason he abducts them seems to be that he needs their math skills  (apparantly he didn't have a computer).
As for Colin Baker, he's not  quite so bad as everyone says.  They needed to do something with the  character of the Doctor to generate more fan interest, which had declined  sharply during the Davison years.  It was an interesting idea to make the  Doctor initially unlikable, and fans who stuck with him eventually saw a  mellower side of Doctor #6.  However, I fail to see how making the main  character unlikable was supposed to make viewers like the show more.  I  mean, honestly, what WERE they thinking???
All these things aside this  story had only a few good moments and was mostly filled with lines that  made you want to cringe.  In short, this was one of the worst debut stories  for a Doctor--second only to Time and the Rani (Almost completely appaling.  I enjoyed maybe 5 minutes of the whole thing).

1. This is Colin Baker's first complete story.
2. The story has the right mix of aliens, world conquering villians, evil plans and timelords.
3. Colin Baker's characterization is cranky and questionable, which is a refreshing change. It leaves the viewer wondering if they actually like this Doctor.

7828883,3,6302665175,"Season finale's tended to be the most exciting story of the season. Why finish this season with Twin Dilemma? I can easily imagine fans of the time trying to maintain interested in this story line after what may have been the greatest regeneration story among all of the classic Doctor Who series. I strongly believe the anticlimatic end to this season with Twin Dilemma set up a disadvantage for Colin Baker's portrayal of the 6th Dr. This isn't near the best of the 6th Doctor stories either. I would have preferred a TV version of Slipback to this.

The story in itself is ok. I personally would have liked more time spent with the 6th Dr and Peri in the first episode. It could have been like ""The Edge of Destruction"" from the 1st Doctor era. The story takes place entirely in the TARDIS with the characters periodically shifting from benevolent in nature to malevolent and with no reason to speak of. The volatile, even manic 6th Doctor at the outset could have explored that aspect of his new persona's introduction. The first episodes starts with this somewhat but it doesn't stay with it. The mystery would be more interesting than the abduction of twin brother math geniuses (abducted for any reason, destroy a planet, appear in a theater production of Hamlet where Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are strangely portrayed by lookalikes.

The 6th Doctor era has some excellent stories. I rank this not far above Timelash, well behind Vengeance on Varos, Two Doctors, Revelation of Daleks, Attack of the Cybermen, Mark of the Rani and even the disjointed Trial of a Timelord.

It does have an excellent DVD but at this point, anyone bother to read these reviews know the classic Doctor Who DVDs have excellent features which make them like Criterion Collections in that regard.

While i am an avid fan of the 6th Doctor. He was the last Doctor I saw as a kid. Not being in the UK and not surrounded by fans of the show, I never returned to it after the hiatus because I never knew it came back until it was far too late. Still, I never felt this story was a a good introduction, and for it to be shown immediately after the fast paced, action filled Caves of Androzani was a bad mistake in my view. Let the notion of a new Doctor build during an off season. Then slam them with the volatile regeneration in a better context than this.",1487894400,,2339,4.575178997613365
