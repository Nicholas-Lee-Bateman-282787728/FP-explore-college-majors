2835600,5,B000QDLSR0,"When I first heard this show advertised the ad said it was a show that was so awesome, the online community was already crazy about it. I found this funny since I spend a LOT of time hanging out with people who are in all the inner discussion circles on the internet and yet they had never mentioned the show. So I asked about it, and they said they had never heard of it either. Still the ad captured my curiosity and I watched the first episode. I have to say if I had reviewed this right after the first show I would still have given it five stars.

THIS SHOW IS AMAZING! It isn't your ordinary everyday superhero show. This isn't some group of people who just decide ""Hey, we should go save people."" They are actual people with actual believable lives. This show is not as much about them saving the world, but saving themselves. All these ""heroes"" have certain things they have to get over, from an extreme geekyness or immaturity, to heroin addiction and beyond. It is one of those shows that is so believable that I think if I found out it was actually nonfiction, I wouldn't be surprised. I am quite honestly addicted to this show. All the episodes are awesome. Buy this product. I'm positive you won't be disappointed.",1179619200,7,1227,4.429203539823009
2835601,5,B000QDLSR0,"The timing for this new show couldn't be better.  With the condition of the world right now, we need to be reminded that there's a HERO in each one of us...think about how you can change the world, one person, one kind deed at a time.  Save your neighbors, Save the World!",1179532800,4,272,4.211538461538462
2835602,5,B000QDLSR0,"What if you discovered that you had a superpower -- great strength, flight, teleportation, or amazing healing? And what if you could use it to save the world?

Superheroes are everywhere in entertainment, from comic books to movies. But few manage to be as intelligent, geeky and well-written as ""Heroes,"" a solid comic-book style TV series that explores the repercussions of several ""ordinary"" people who discover that they have strange -- and sometimes dangerous -- powers.

It opens with Mohinder Suresh (Sendhil Ramamurthy) reflecting on the human quest for knowledge -- even knowledge that we shouldn't have -- right before learning that his father has been killed, possibly murdered. Suresh's dad believed that ""special"" people were cropping up, much like in X-Men.

And we are introduced to the ""heroes"": stripper Niki (Ali Larter) harbors a secret dark side, cheerleader Claire (Hayden Panettiere) heals from any injury, Japanese Dilbert Hiro (Masi Oka) can bend time and space, Senatorial candidate Nathan (Adrian Pasdar) is able to fly, his brother Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) can copy others' powers, a cop Matt (Greg Grunberg) can read minds, and junkie artist Isaac (Santiago Cabrera) sees the future. There are plenty of others that show up, but these start the ball rolling.

While Claire and Hiro explore the potential of their new powers, Niki and her son try to elude some hired thugs --and end up overwhelmed by her dark side, and framed. And Suresh searches for the answer to his father's death, only to find that his genetics research is involved with the ""special people,"" and that a superpowered serial killer is targeting them.

Even worse, Hiro takes a trip to New York (five weeks in the future), and sees the city destroyed by a massive blast -- as does Isaac, through his paintings. How to stop it? As a future Hiro tells them, ""save the cheerleader, save the world."" The Heroes begin slowly coming into contact, in a haze of dreams, visions, murder, swords and death -- and to stop the serial killer and save New York, more sacrifices may be made...

Unlike most shows about people with superpowers, ""Heroes"" isn't really about the action or flashy battles. It's half epic save-the-world-as-a-team story, and half exploration of how real, ordinary people would react if they suddenly found out that they had superpowers, and how this would change -- or NOT change -- their lives.

The storylines are incredibly intricate and complex, since there are a dozen subplots and a lot of time travel, and plenty of hints at future events. The careful painting of all these storylines even further in two episodes, one of which shows the pre-Heroic lies of the characters (and how Syler became a murderous terror), and another that shows what the future will be like if they don't change it. It's not a pretty picture.

These complex storylines are enhanced by lots of suspense and tightly directed action, and the makers always know how to throw in a shocking twist, such as a sword-carrying future Hiro showing up.. But there is also some poignancy, and very dark humor from time to time (Claire waking up in mid-autopsy, or twisting her broken neck around). Not to mention some great, sometimes geeky dialogue (""Where did you learn all this?"" ""X-men No. 143 when Kitty Pryde time travels!"").

The actors are pretty much all good -- Larter gives a great double performance, Zachary Quinto is a wonderfully twisted villain, and Panettiere gives a good performance as a teen whose adolescence has a lot more than hormones in store. Masi Oka is the standout, though -- his Hiro is sweet, endearing, geeky, heroic, sad, kindly, funny and thoroughly lovable. The scene where he arrives in New York is adorable.

The ""Heroes"" are only starting their journey, and the first season of this geeky hit is a must-see for fans of intelligent sci-fi drama. And I doubt their journey is over...",1179532800,388,3899,4.938931297709924
2835603,5,B000QDLSR0,"**WARNING: SOME SPOILERS AHEAD**

Welcome to the world of HEROES. The pilot episode titled: GENESIS gets the series off and running right off the bat with the voiceover of a Indian genetics professor named Mohinder Suresh. Suresh surmises ""If God has indeed created himself in his own image, then I submit to you that God is a cockroach."" With Episode 1, this great series succeeds in creating this realistic, modern day world where you have these very ordinary people suddenly finding themselves blessed with extraordinary abilities or cursed with them.

This realistic environment, sans spandex, clever codenames, capes and secret identities hidden behind masks becomes a world one can easily accept. Much like the world of Marvel's merry mutants, the human race is on the threshold of a major leap in evolution. In fact, this threshold has already been engaged and breached because these beings are already among us emerging from all corners of the globe.

If one can suspend their disbelief for a moment, you can buy into the fact that a human being can fly while another one can read other's thoughts. But the strength of the seiries lies with the viewer's ability to ignore the super powers angle for a
minute and get to know this interesting cast of characters; plain every day characters that we can come into or have come into contact with during our lives already.

We come to know Peter, a male nurse who has the ability to absorb powers of other heroes through proximity and re-use them.

Nathan: His brother who is gifted with the power of flight.

Matt: A police officer who can read the minds of those around him.

D.L.: A former ex-con who has the power of phasing through solid and organic objects.

Claire: A cheerleader with regenerative healing powers and appears indestructible.

Hiro: A loveable Japanese cubicle slave with the power of time travel and the manipulation of the space time continuum

Isaac: A comic book artist who is able to paint the future when he's under the influence of heroin

Micah: A young boy with techo-kinesis; the ability to tap into any machine and hotwire it's programming for total control of various electronic devices and his mother Niki who is in constant struggle to suppress her super-human enhanced and possibly-evil twin doppelganger Jessica

If there is a lead to be found within this fine cast it may very well be, what we come to know will be the most powerful of the good guys, the aforementioned male nurse Peter Petrelli. His story will cross the paths of several of the major players of this show, including Mohinder himself who has traveled far to New York City to delve deep into the death of his father and the mysteries that surround it.

While many found the pilot episode short on action, more fans believed that the success of the show went into it's riveting character development and simple storyline and arcs peppered throughout the season with timely catch phrases: ""Save the Cheerleader, Save the World""  and ""Are you on the List?"" aiding the series into playing out like one live action comic book with connecting chapters.

For instance, the first chapter establishes that Mohinder, as well as looking into his father's death, is also on the search for ""Patient Zero,"" allegedly the very first person to develop these special mutant abilities. If Mohinder is on the search for this individual, the question of the first leg of the series is the mystery surrounding the ""horn-rimmed glasses"" dude or HRG, Mr. Bennet who seems to be somehow wrapped up in the death of Mohinder's father and at the same time is aware of the research that the Suresh's were conducting.

His affiliation with the Primatech Paper Company only serves as a cover for an organization (how large remains to be seen) that investigates and studies these same fascinating beings with superhuman abilities.

Oh, by the way, did I mention that this mr. Bennet is also the foster father of our resident cheerleader? That's right. The one with the healing factor. But at the pilot's conclusion begins the arc that will take these heroes and the fans on a tremendous journey throughout the season. One cataclysmic and singular event must be prevented from occurring.

On the floor of the future-painting artist named Isaac we see New York City seemingly obliterated within a mushroom cloud. When the artist utters the words ""we have to stop it"" the rollercoaster ride begins.

So, if a connection has been made to these fine beings as a homage to the X-men, then their chief antagonist Sylar serves as the series Magneto. Except Magneto is more of a defender of his oppressed fellow mutants. Sylar shows no such allegiance to anyone save Sylar. Sylar, formerly known as Gabriel Gray has emerged as the villain of the show who is on the hunt for these super-powered beings as well.

Not to study, not to conduct tests, but to acquire their powers and make their powers his. Unlike Peter Petrelli, Sylar has to kill these gifted beings by slicing open their heads and stealing their powers through some unknown manner. Though it's been hinted that Sylar eats his victims brains thus digesting their powers, this has yet to be established.

Although from start to finish, it's hard to find an episode that wasn't fine in it's execution and story telling, my first season favorites are:

Episode 4: Collision (where Peter meets the future Hiro)
Episode 8:Seven Minutes to Midnight (Hiro meets Charlie)
Episode 9:Homecoming (Peter and Sylar square off, Eden and the Haitian show up too)
Episode 10:Six Months Ago (Hiro goes back in time to change the present)
Episode 14:Distractions (Claude becomes a mentor to Peter)
Episode 15:Run! (Matt encounters Jessica)
Episode 17:Company Man (the enigmatic Ted Sprague goes nuclear)
Episode 20:Five Years Gone (5 years into the future reveals darker heroes and a reality where heroes are labeled as terrorists) and
Episode 21:the Hard Part (Linderman's involvement in the Hawkins family is revealed).
Is it presumptious of me to say that I'll probably LOVE the season finale:
Episode 23: How to Stop an Exploding Man??? since I am writing this review a few days BEFORE the season finale airs?

Perhaps. That's just how great this season has been going. Watch Heroes with one friend or 10. Then talk about it with 100 more. But you will definitely enjoy this show. Sit back and watch sci-fi television at it's finest.",1179446400,19,6399,4.888273314866113
2835604,5,B000QDLSR0,"Due to great writing and is visually gorgeous everyone from teens to very mature adults can love this show, despite its graph comic book feel.  You don't normally get this stuff on TV.  Along with plenty of actions and cliff hanger endings, the characters are interesting.  You want to know more about them. You care what happens.

The problem is it is too good and way too different.  The network will start interfering and it will be dumbed down; or it will be pulled in the next season.  (The show is on the bloody side for network TV and the characters a little more international than usual.)  I just hope they finish the story and don't try to milk it out.

I am going to wait until all the seasons complete before buying.  There will more than likely be included some interesting extras when the buying a complete package of all seasons.  There is also DVD/Blu-Ray war going on and the HDTV is still evolving in the market place.  By next year everything technical should settle down.",1179446400,,991,4.5423728813559325

The original pilot was supposedly so convoluted and downright annoying that the network made the producers basically change everything about it, and the only reason the show was greenlite was because NBC ran out of Drama pilots.

2835644,4,B000QDLSR0,"Even casual readers of this blog will know that I hate superheroes, so why then did I watch the series Heroes? The truth is that I put it off for a long time, until I unlocked it's secret. They aren't really superheroes and the special abilities that some of the characters posses is only a small part of the story.

All around the country, ordinary people are discovering that they have remarkable abilities. Some see these abilities as the next natural step in human evolution, other see these people as a threat. The show begins with one group trying to understand their abilities and how to use them for good. A second group is trying to exploit there abilities for personal gain, while the third works for a group known as the company, which is trying to contain the whole situation.

From a TV standpoint, this show was really innovative with special effects and a large cast of future stars, but there in lied the problem. The show was so expensive to produce that by the fourth season, when the ratings started to fall off, the show was cancelled. However, thanks to streaming services like Netflix, the die-hard fans were able to prove their love for the show, and six years later, NBC has brought it back for a fifth season, which will supposedly tie up the loose ends from the season four cliffhanger.

The show is continuous and the multiple story lines are vast, so I won't go into them, but I will mention a few stand outs from the cast. Heroes launched the career of Zachary Quinto, who played the villian Syler. Syler has the power to absorb others abilities and become the most powerful of them all, only he is unable to focus leading him in many directions. Sometimes he's helpful, other times he has plans of world domination, and occasionally he just wants to know where he came from. Syler is the deepest, most interesting character of them all, going through a range of emotion and a love/hate relationship with the audience. The ability to portray such a complex character has led Quinto to superstardom and rightfully so.

Next is Masi Oka as Hiro Nakamura, the master of space and time. The Hiro character not only added a lot of much needed levity to the show, but also introduced writers to all kinds of possibilities, such as time travel and alternate histories. To me, these were some of the best story arks they had and it's all the more fun, when the guy leading the charge is hilarious.

Finally is Hayden Panettiere, as Clare Bennett, the cheerleader who can not be hurt. She's the character that most fans can relate to, because she's just a teenage girl caught between the factions. All she wants is a normal life, but can someone that can heal themselves ever truly be normal?

Heroes was terrific science fiction, which covered more story lines and topics in four years, then some shows have covered in twenty. The characters are always changing and the story is continuous, so don't skip episodes. There are constantly changing roles and relationships, which kept the series fresh, moving, and always entertaining. Even if you didn't like one of the story arks, there were still a half dozen more going on at the same time. Heroes is some of the best science fiction you will ever see on TV, it's just a shame that it only lasted four seasons. It is a perfect example of the networks continuing desire to go with cost over quality.",1446249600,,3369,4.625418060200669

I know some seasons weren't as good as others but the creator Tim Kring did a excellent job. This is the best show I have ever watched. Yes some people might not agree but if you think about it what show in the last 10 years has spawned this many careers? Not even walking dead has done this. Zachary Quinto is Spock in 2 Star trek films, a full season of American horror story as well as the upcoming hitman sequel. Hayden Panettiere has been in several movies that have made it to theaters including scream 4 and is the main character in the show Nashville and boosted the career of Ali Larter who has stared in 2 resident evil films and will be in the next one as well. If heroes did exist they would have issues and conflicts like this show brings out and that's one of the reasons I like this show. Also they don't ware masks or tights lol. I will always be a fan. Please support this show when it airs on NBC this year as well as buy past seasons brand new. If we push real hard these 13 episodes will not be the last.",1422662400,2,1120,4.1187214611872145

2835714,2,B000QDLSR0,"- flying politician-guy is married and easily cheats on his wife (of course, he IS a
  politician; or, not counting that, you can use the excuse that he IS a guy)

- cheerleader with the ability to physically regenerate crashes the car in attempt to kills the guy who tried to rape her; she spends almost all of the episodes crying and being a pain (though she does help rescue some folks)

- boring-woman, who strips online to make money from horny guys, has a 'split personality' that takes her over and kills people she's having problems with -- and is the one that got-it-on with that flying politician; she the totally-worst character here with a fully-useless 'ability'

- time-stopping dude named ""Hiro"" (ha ha) knows he doesn't want to cheat at casinos but is doing it repeatedly (corruption from the love of money is a bit understandable)

- apparently-dangerous kid's dad breaks out of jail using his ability to pass through objects (known a bit only in deleted scenes and from his sudden appearance) and returns to the boring-woman who is/was his wife or just a lover; later, boring-woman's psycho personality tries to kill the dude

- son of the boring-woman uses his power to mainly rob and ATM of thousands of dollars (another exaple of corruption from cash); like he and the boring-woman and bad walk-through-objects dad, none of them have anything to contribute to the story

- guy who paints the future but only when using heroin? (maybe the should have titled one of the episodes ""HeroIn"" in a tale that dealt a bunch more with him)

There are more examples, but are any of these things heroic? Of course not. I'm through the fourteenth episode and I'm wondering when it's going to live up to its title. I thought that back when I was done with the fifth episode. The policeman who can read minds, to me, is the only one dealing with the abilities in a heroic/helpful manner and the only one who seems decent. Oh...and it seems that the politician's brother, too, who tries to save the cheerleader.

Do all real heroes have to have some part of a slutty, drug-addictive, criminal, murderous, cheating background? I bet some will say ""it's more realistic because everyone has problems in life"". Maybe, but where is the heroism after all this time in a show called HEROES? If this was a real comic book, I still wouldn't be interested in this forgettable mess.

They spread this out over 22 episodes or so. I think it should have been just a mini-series. There was promise, but it quickly fizzled-out. Each episode has ""...to be continued"" and, though I made it through this, there's nothing in it to make me continue with other seasons. Of course, I also have no interest in any TV special that, I hear, is unfortunately coming. Maybe they'll kick-it-up a notch -- or three -- and it will have characters that are senior citizens. A comedy where we see them kick-butt or boring people to death with stories of days of yore? Now THAT might be interesting.",1410739200,,2971,4.661567877629063

2835749,3,B000QDLSR0,"OK...I can't find a place to give an overall review of the entire 4 seasons of this show, so I'll do it here!  Judging from the ratings I'm seeing, I seem to be vastly outnumbered in my opinion...nonetheless, here it is:  Season 1 is REALLY fun!  At that time it was one of my favorite shows...it certainly wasn't Shakespeare, but I'm guessing that's not what anyone here is looking for anyways!  REALLY fun, great, well-drawn characters, comedy, drama, and a very nicely done comic book approach to the whole thing...loved it!

Season 2 was pretty much more of the same...we're getting to know our characters, good and bad, even better (Zachary Quinto was an AWESOME bad guy, until about the middle of Season 3 or so).  Writing is still good, lots of ups & downs with the comedy/drama mix, lots of surprises...still a barrel of fun!

Season 3 started going in the dumpster, on a pretty large scale!  Story line started getting to be a real head-scratcher, characters started not being who they were (I know characters can grow/develop/change etc., but this stuff was getting very odd...""Tune in next week and I'll be totally different than I have been for 2 1/2 years!"")  Plot lines started going in strange directions that didn't seem to have much to do with anything other than ""Oh...let's do this...that'll be cool!""  I think this was the season that a gratuitous lesbian lip-lock was thrown in for no apparent reason...not that there's anything wrong with gratuitous lesbian lip-locks, I'm just sayin'....

Season 4 got ugly...nothing made a bit of sense, characters didn't seem to know who they were, or why they were doing this week's stuff, from one episode to the next.  It all felt desperate, as if there was no more coal in the furnace...it was sad, and ugly.
I couldn't have liked this show more in Season 1...I couldn't have been more disappointed by Season 4...ouch.  Consider yourself warned!",1406937600,,1907,4.8128834355828225

2835782,2,B000QDLSR0,"As a movie series, it is well filmed with good special effects and has an interesting story, but for my tastes has too much violence. I watched it on Amazon Prime Instant Video and it was nice there were no advertisements, like there would be it you watched in on Hulu.

2835787,3,B000QDLSR0,Heros-we're somewhat entertaining. . .to much to throw at viewer.  Watched two episodes in hopes that things would move to something worth my time.  Too dark and too many elements at once.,1402876800,,188,4.84375
2835788,5,B000QDLSR0,What can I say ?  The script is very good;  the acting superb. The storyline is very action oriented.

2835794,5,B000QDLSR0,"Found this TV series by accident and really enjoy it.  It is good fantasy, good human interest. Similar to ""Alphas"" which unfortunately didn't last.

2835804,5,B000QDLSR0,The first 2-3 seasons were strong and then  the simple storyline went flat when it left the basic premise that small people can do great things and be a strong force in this world.

2835875,5,B000QDLSR0,"This was a great start of a show with so much potential.  When it first aired, I didn't have DVR and only tuned in during the first pivotal moment of the series--our newly banded heroes' climatic moment in their race to save the cheerleader.  As the line blurred between those who have good, bad, and selfish intentions, we are peppered which many twists and turns designed to keep us off-balance.  This is what made the first season groundbreaking for TV.  The moral ethics and fear of the unknown has long been a theme in the world of comic books and Sci-Fi.  But now we had a live-action vehicle, successfully portraying super-powered humans dealing with these dilemmas, in real world situation.  It's too bad there was only 1 1/2 season worth of this.  Fortunately, this show opened the door for other major networks to entertain signing on more of the sci-fi genre from some of the best creative minds.",1392681600,,907,4.7025316455696204
2835876,5,B000QDLSR0,"The series ""Heroes"" started off with an incredible first season.  About partway through they have, in my opinion, the strongest episode of the entire show - ""Five Years Gone"" which seems to take a good deal of inspiration from ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (the cartoon in particular).  The president has rounded up (in a very Nazi-esque manner) all the mutants (or whatever they're referred to in the show, honestly I forget) and put them in camps, killed them, or worse.  Time traveling Future-Hiro joins up with Present Day-Hiro and we get to see what all the future versions of the main characters are in a doomsday future setting.  I don't want to say more because I'm tempted to spoil some surprises.

At any rate - the whole arc of the first series is fantastic.  Every episode is great in its own way and the entire show seems to have a strong X-Men/Mutant vibe to it.  Big bonus being Christopher Eccelstein as Peter Petrelli's teacher in the ways of superpowers.

All that being said - it's strongly advisable to stop watching after this season.  Writer changes and complete redirection of plot, the nature of the powers, complete nerfing of the main counterbalance to Sylar, weird mutations and other things that are only half-developed all overshadow some interesting story lines but ultimately, things go downhill from Season 2 and never recover.",1392681600,,1358,4.869565217391305

2835879,4,B000QDLSR0,"A review of the plot and overall enjoyableness (its a word! I looked it up.) of Season 1 and The Series as a whole.

Season 1 of Heroes, at the least is interesting. At its best, a groundbreaking (for its time) network Sci-fi show. It had some great ideas that start to get jumbled as the series progresses.

The Bad- The teenage drama becomes tiring after a while, i know it's their to entice a younger audience. But, in my opinion, there are more than enough teenage dramas to satisfy a few decades worth of teenage angst.

-It's a bit formulaic (as all serial dramas eventually become)

-I know some people enjoyed the vast array of characters, but i found it a bit distracting that new names were introduced and dropped before you could remember what they did exactly.

-The series as a whole, and mildly in Season 1 had a chronic flip-flop problem. Every episode lead you to believe a different character was in fact a Villain and not a Hero only to switch it back a few episodes later. I enjoy a morally ambiguous character as much as the next guy but I started to get whip lash from the constant change of intentions.

The Good

-A truly interesting core group of characters. Season 1 did a great job of telling several separate stories that wind up merging in the end. The writers did a great job of showing many different paths to ""destiny.""

-The comic relief characters were an integral part of the story line. They weren't limited to bumbling oafs who never contribute to the solution. A surprisingly difficult writing technique for current, and past, network TV writers.

-A genuinely terrifying Villain. His ""Theme Music"" will haunt my dreams.

For what its worth, this is a great Sci-Fi/Drama. Interesting characters and a slightly new spin on the tired concept of saving the world (Please, those currently saving the world, we never actually get tired of you stopping the Apocalypse. Keep up the good work.) A good ""binge watching"" show and definitely recommended for Sci-fi fans.",1392336000,,1996,4.693409742120344
2835880,5,B000QDLSR0,"This is a series of four. I find the series of 4 very interesting but you have to follow it very closely. Oh, buy all 4 on Blu.ray Disc",1392249600,,135,3.689655172413793
2835881,5,B000QDLSR0,"good show.  wish i'd watched it when it was on, altho then i couldn't binge-watch it like i am now.  its not at all what i thought it was about - it's so much better.",1392249600,,166,3.7142857142857144

It's 16 hours and 49 minutes long with subtitles English,Spanish and French.

After 7 long years,I finally get to see Heroes. I wanted to watch it when it first came out but because I work nights I can't watch any shows that I wanted to watch even until now. Thanks to Xfinity on Demand I can watch any show the day after. Didn't have that when Heroes premiered. If you like superhero movies/shows or if you are just like me who never got the chance to see the show, buy all the seasons. Seasons 1,2 and 4 are in a very good price right now,11-12 bucks.
Season 3 is up to $18 plus and I am patiently waiting for the price to come down before I buy it. I recommend buying the dvd/blu-ray instead of instant video although you can watch it anytime, anywhere in your device. I like the dvd for my collection. Too bad Heroes didn't last five seasons. But then The Cape only lasted one. The only reason standing in any shows way is ratings. It's mind boggling when un-reality shows get more seasons than other shows.

The abilities include time travel, healing, absorbing other people's powers, and flight.  For a significant amount of time the viewer is unsure what all is going on as more and more characters are introduced into the story.

While one person appears to be absorbing peoples' abilities and killing them another person (horned rimmed glasses) appears to be tagging/tracking people. Eric Roberts and George Takei appear briefly and Hayden Penettier is one of the main focused upon characters as a cheerleader. Engaging and imaginative as well as addicitive. Unforgettable.

2835937,5,B000QDLSR0,I have season 2-4 on regular dvd. I can see the difference with the picture on blueray. I don't know why some are complaining about the background that is not as clear. The sound in my opinion is better than watching an action movie that usually has dialogue that is too quiet and action scenes that are way too loud.,1388361600,,317,4.3
2835938,5,B000QDLSR0,The series is great. I watched with my GF so she could catch up to me. Love the marathon style watching. Its easy to get hooked on the series. A must watch if you like sci-fi or super hero type shows.,1388361600,,200,3.902439024390244

2835951,5,B000QDLSR0,I'd been trying to catch this series for years as a couple of people who's opinion I trust told me it was good. They were 100% correct. I loved Lost and this is simular in the fact that its one long story with questions always popping up with unseen twist also popping up. The writting and acting is wonderful. Now I just hope the 2nd season is as big of a drop off as I was told.,1386547200,,380,3.948051948051948

2835954,5,B000QDLSR0,"What can I say, the Heroes TV series started on a high note and quickly nose dived.  Season 1 was excellent after that it plummeted.  Season 2 started out weak and being shortened by the writers strike it just seemed unpolished and incomplete.  By the third season there was no doubt the show wouldn't last.  Still the 1st season is well worth watching.  I purposely wrote this review with no information on what happens during the seasons to avoid any spoilers, it's apparent I didn't care much for the following seasons.

Unfortunately though, some of the scenes are hamfisted, and several of the actors turn in a mediocre performance.  I watched the first season when it was first aired, but never bothered with the second season or beyond.  Something about this show however made me want to revisit it.  So I spun up season 1 on Amazon only a few weeks ago.  Even though I had seen it once prior, I was still compelled to watch it a second time through to the end.  Sure there's a lot of suspense and violence, but this show now seems tame compared to the grittiness contemporary dramas such as S.O.A and Breaking Bad.",1385856000,,688,4.5
2835957,4,B000QDLSR0,"BLUF: A fun and interesting show that will keep you returning episode to episode.

I don't buy the theory that HEROS is a superb television show with something unique to say. However, it is good fun. It manages to be part comic book, part soap opera, and part serial - like the old Flash Gordon serials that would run just before the full movie back in the thirties.

This series was brought to my attention when I noted that many folks who wrote reviews of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-4400-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001CQONMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 4400: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;mentioned that this was a very similar show. While HEROS is much more professionally done in terms of character development and special effects, The 4400 is a much more complex and meaningful show in terms of message and implied meanings.

Despite this I suspect that HEROS has a very wide appeal. It should be of interest to those who enjoy comic books, those who remember the serials from the thirties, and, much like a soap opera, characters easily - and plausibly - switch back and forth between being villains and heros.

I enjoyed this series and think most people will as well.",1385683200,,1226,5.33678756476684

2835966,3,B000QDLSR0,"My son was the one that started watching this series, I am more or less along for the ride.  BUT, since I'm paying for the Amazon account, here's my two cents worth.

Each season is treated as if it's a chapter in a ... well, a super hero comic.  Something major is going on and at least that main item will be resolved by the end of the season.  (that's a good thing, as they don't overly drag out major plots before they wear out their welcome.).

Structurally, think a Soap Opera tied to A comic book (mainly dark, very X-manish...  Hero's on the outs, being hunted, that sort of thing).  Hero's... well, their powers are very ""convenient"", there are a few throw away characters, but for the most part the powers of the characters HAVE to be that way or the  plot doesn't progress.

So, you get the complexity of a Soap, where a lot of the characters are connected but don't really know it, coupled with the powers that make each of them distinct.  So, a lot of the ""fun"" to me is figuring out how the pieces of the characters fit together and where the heck the plot is going.

There's a decent amount to like here, good humor, decent action, hateable villains, that sort of thing.

There's a lot where you groan, ""Oh why did they do something that stupid...  Really?  this character decided to go darkside on everyone because of that?!?  OMG they can't be serious...""

Most annoying part to the whole thing is a lot of it winds up being sub-titled because several of  the  characters speak limited English.  It does give it an interesting flavor, but gets past being annoying after awhile.

The boy is into the last season and although there's a lot of ""They did what?"" moments in it, he continues to enjoy it and I haven't thrown anything at the TV while it's on, so there's that.

So, if you don't mind a decent amount of stupidity, and some reasonably gross scenes (One of the villains likes to cut off the top of people's head and poke around in their brains with his finger (gains their powers that way)).

It can and is a decent amount of fun.

Would I watch it myself if I wasn't a parental captive?  Dunno, don't really think so.",1383436800,,2142,4.378172588832487

The seasons final episode is truly great and it wraps up the story told very nicely.

2836078,2,B000QDLSR0,"I have watched the first 12 episodes of season 1. I didn't know exactly what to expect as to the quality of the show, so I didn't have any important expectations. However, after only a few episodes, I knew that this was the worst TV show I have ever bothered to watch.
Somebody might ask, ""Well, why did you even bother to watch it?""
I can answer that.
Sylar.
I was very interested to see his character, because I'm generally pretty fascinated by human evil. I am also fascinated by deep psychological evaluations and portrayals, of which this show has none.
Seriously, I think I'm just going to write this review about two things.
The show fails for two things. The writing is horrendous
and as a result of the poor writing, and a poor premise (let's have a dozen main characters!) the show is cliched, uninspired, bland, and with few exceptions, terribly boring.
I know what you might be thinking; ""You just want a bunch of action.""
No, I don't. Some of my favorite movies have very little action; Fargo, There Will Be Blood, No Country for Old Men, Taxi Driver. They rely on other things to make their point.
But back to Heroes. Back to the characters.

With a show so stuffed with people, I can count the characters that are interesting on one hand.
Claire's Dad. Hiro is ok and tries to provide some comic relief by being Japanese.
And that's it.
Jessica/Nicky is a failed attempt at psychological depth. Her son has none, constantly pining for his mom, despite her a)leaving him alone for hours on end, b) shooting his dad, and c) seriously injuring him. He is a plot device.
Peter actually doesn't do anything; pay attention. He just whines about his brother, not understanding anything, blahblahblah.
Mind-reading cop; so..he's been hearing people's thoughts for weeks, and yet every time he tries to hear them, he has to cock his head towards them, and then REACT immediately to what they're thinking?? No wonder he can't pass the detective test; he's so terrible at investigating!
Mohinder is sooo boring. ""I gotta do this quest. This quest is lame. Dreams. I gotta do this quest."" His scenes make me want to kill myself. Or him, actually.
Painter-his scenes are also the most boring. He is a plot device.
Painter's (ex)-girlfriend. Plot device.
Ando, Nathan, Zach, DL, all plot devices. See a pattern?
A TV show with such a focus on 'the characters', yet most of them are so undeveloped and poorly written that it becomes a slog. The writing is simply not smart, and it makes things take forever while the characters try to figure stuff out.
Actually..now that I'm thinking about it..the waitress was very well-acted. I liked her character a lot; she was very sweet and it made me care about her. However...if somebody could explain.
Why did she not recognize Hiro when he sees her six months after meeting her for the first time?
If Hiro meets her..Goes back six months.
Then wouldn't there be two Hiros, six months prior to her death? One interacts with the waitress. One does not. Then six months later he does again? And she remembers EVERYTHING, right?
I just don't understand...

There are a lot of things I won't understand about this show, mainly the choices that the writers made.
They still haven't DONE anything. Nothing at all complex or interesting or deserving or a second playthrough. AT ALL.
I just wish Peter would explode already.
Oh well. Back to Breaking Bad.",1371600000,,3390,4.705387205387205

2836092,3,B000QDLSR0,"Intrigued by the story, but ultimately found too many characters annoying. Also, I was taken out of the story too often because a character would do something just too stupid to suspend my disbelief.",1369872000,,199,4.882352941176471
2836093,3,B000QDLSR0,"I love the concept for this show. Instead of superheros with superpowers dressing up in tights to save the world, Heroes features a bunch of ordinary citizens who have superpowers - and face the consequences. These characters each have unique powers and each copes with the powers in his or her unique way. The show had a lot of potential for character development and moral allegory.

I think the show partly succeeds in the former. Some of the characters become quite interesting and unique. However, unfortunately, too many of the characters are too milquetoast. It's as if in not wanting to make the characters comic book superheroes the show makes them boring. I think this was the wrong direction. Too many of these characters would have been interchangeable with your average soap opera character with little difference, except for the flying, electricity, etc.

Where the show really disappointed me is the story. There was a lot of potential, but the writers chose to go with the usual tropes of 1) a secret corporate conspiracy, 2) a psychopathic villain, and 3) a plot to blow up New York City. I for one am sick of these. In recent years it seems like most sci-fi shows have adopted one or both of these tropes. Few of the episodes provide particularly thoughtful plots. I didn't ever find myself thinking that the show raised a particularly interesting or novel moral issue. Too bad.

Heroes does have strong production value and acting. It does a decent job tempting you to keep watching until the next episode, usually through excellent use of cliffhangers. However, after watching an episode, it all seems like a blur rather than something that will stay with me for the rest of my life.

Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars. Good for what it is, but it becomes tiresome after a while.",1369785600,,1796,4.783870967741936

I think you would like it too if you like a combination of mystery, science fiction, fantasy and what makes people tick.  I like the characters and even feel sorry for the bad guy a little.

I only thing I didn't like was the way the season ended.  It was a little rushed and a little bit of a let down.  On to Volume 2!",1368835200,,537,3.827272727272727

2836173,5,B000QDLSR0,I love this show because it isn't a reality TV show exploiting human relationships.  Heros is pure fantasy in the modern world without being about vampires or werewolves.,1362096000,,170,5.071428571428571
2836174,1,B000QDLSR0,"I think the reason so many people like this show is because they WANT to like it.  I mean, what's not to like about the premise?  Ordinary people discovering they have extraordinary abilities sounds pretty cool right?  Unfortunately, the lame writing destroys the potential.  This show falls into a common trap, it fails to explain the current episode (any of them) by the past.  It also hangs its hat on evolution (to the point of becoming preachy) which is stupid.  How would evolution suddenly contradict the laws of physics?

***May Contain Spoilers***

For instance, why does Sylar want Claire so badly?  We already know he can't be killed because Matt shoots him 4 times (or more) while defending the one-note FBI chick .  Sylar is seen getting up in the background and then he disappears.  If he can heal, why chase after Claire?  Towards the end of the season, Ted is caught and put in the back of a SWAT truck and hauled off.  This guy can 'go nuclear' anytime he wants.  We already know he has a bad temper yet when Sylar starts to cut open his head, he just sits there.  Also, why does Nathan have to fly Peter out of the city?  Peter can fly by himself!  It makes zero sense.  Couple all of that with characters that either never mature (ie. they run around constantly in a panic and never seem to come to terms with their powers ala-Claire, Peter, Nathan) or don't add any real purpose to the story (D.L., Micah, Jessica/Nikki) and you end up with a long, drawn out story.

The second season starts ""4 months later"" yet we still find Claire ""trying"" to hurt herself for no apparent reason and her dad is still as creepy as ever.  They should have cut down on the number of characters and developed the back story more.  Make me like and care about the people.  Make the people deeper in personality.  Slow down and actually TELL a story instead of flashing from scene to scene.  I really wanted to like this series but in the end, it's just way over the top.",1361923200,4,1971,4.456582633053221

A great series that unfortunately has been cancelled, or has been discontinued.
Currently only 4 seasons available, and an ok ending, does keep you hooked from start to finish!

Characters constantly fluctuate between good and evil, and most of the storyline is focused on the grey area, between good and evil.

It has great humor, and suspense! The action is somewhat watered down.
But despite that, it's definitely a show to watch, and a must-have in your Sci-Fi collection!

No ""parametric Hyperbolic warpdrive""-talk; most of the series is about the humans, and their interactions with each other.",1355788800,,710,5.042735042735043
2836219,4,B000QDLSR0,"Heroes was one of the best shows on television when it first hit the air.  It is a character-driven piece about a group of seemingly ordinary yet extraordinary individuals who are disconnected from one another at first--the high school cheerleader who can regenerate; the LA cop who reads minds; the congressional candidate who can fly; and others with special abilities.  There is also the evil Sylar who is trying to steal their powers one-by-one so that he can be the most ""special"" of them all.  As the episodes unfold, these individuals find that their destinies are leading them together in order to save the world.

Series creator Tim Kring has given us a new mythology.  In terms of philosphy and spirituality, the series does wrestle with some of the classic questions: Who am I?  How did I get here?  Why am I here?  What is wrong with the world?  The worldview is a bit muddled, however, with talk about random human evolution in some places, and then destiny (seemingly from a higher power) in others.  The show does not slow down long enough to sort these out.  Having multiple writers for each episode probably did not help.

The blu-ray transfer is an upgrade from the DVD, yet it has some problems.  While most scenes have crisp detail and sharp colors, there are some that have noticeable film grain and/or digital noise.  The sound played well on my system.  If you want the best edition, this is it.  But it is not perfect.

Parental Advisory: This show was made for broadcast television, so it stays within certain boundaries.  With that said, it does push those boundaries in some places.  There are brief, scattered scenes of sexuality, mild language, and drug abuse.  The most problematic piece is the violence and gore, including some frightening images, which occur at least once in every episode.  The serial killer Sylar dispatches his victims by cutting off the tops of their heads and removing their brains.  There are other scenes that involve fighting, torture and gore.  This series is not intended for pre-teens.

Heroes Season One was one of the best shows on television at the time.  Sadly, the series lost its way in subsequent seasons.  But this first season retains its impact, particularly in the season climax.  I recommend it for those who love superhero movies, but those who are bit squeamish as well as those with sensitive consciences might want to keep the remote close by so you can fast forward through some of the more offensive scenes.",1355356800,2,2485,4.7995283018867925

2836227,4,B000QDLSR0,"Knowing how Heroes fell off during the remaining seasons, I wasn't expecting much more than another NBC big concept show that looked promising, but bombed out in a spectacular way. To be absolutely honest, I think NBC is still lost in something of a Heroes syndrome because every year they debut a new big concept show and virtually every year it disappoints.

I bought this set about three years ago because I had a crush on Hayden Panettiere and I'm just now getting around to the DVD's...

I LOVE the concept of Heroes, a live action comic book starring a group of real-life superheroes that save the world. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful because it combines gritty, big city, real world interiors and exteriors with the graphic design features that we would typically see in comic books. Heroes had a really unique look that blurred reality and fantasy into one hypnotizing world that held this viewer spellbound. Shame, they couldn't keep it together in later years.

It's not the best transfer I've seen, they have a lot of murky looking shadows and darkly lit scene problems with the transfer, being that they look pixelated and muddy. Other than that, the effects look good, colors are vibrant and detail is good. There is no new features from the DVD version and the box design is exactly the same.

2836237,5,B000QDLSR0,"When I first heard about this show, I don't know how many years ago it was now, I didn't think I would enjoy it much because the concept of it wasn't very original; like yet another version of X-Men or something. But I was so very wrong in that assumption because despite its unoriginality it was very well written, with characters I actually cared about, and had impressive acting and presentation for a show on NBC; a station I don't watch much at all. Sure the show is over-dramatic at times, and somewhat campy at others, but it tells an interesting story that engages several characters and it delivers on its climax scenes most of the time IMO. If you haven't seen the show and are a fan of superhero stories than I would definitely recommend season 1 of Heroes; the other seasons to a significant lesser extent. If you're a fan but still don't own any of the seasons than I'd say get the special edition (or whatever it's called) that contains more stuff for roughly the same price.",1339632000,,989,4.5

2836250,5,B000QDLSR0,"Heroes is a show that is about ordinary people who discover they are developing superpowers. They have to stop New York City from suffering a nuclear explosion, but there are also mysterious villains and government conspiracies. Sounds a bit like X-Men, right? But anyway, what makes Heroes great is not the action but the characters and how they develop over the season. Nikki Sanders has a spli-personality, one half is bad-ass, and she must learn how to control it. Claire, a high school cheerleader, is able to heal any injury, which she must keep secret from everyone around her. Sylar, the mysterious villain of the show, also has an interesting backstory. But the best character of all is Hiro Nakamura, a goofy office worker who can teleport and bend time (but he has trouble controlling it). Over the season, the heroes gather to try to stop the New York explosion. If you're looking for comic book action you will only find a little here, and one mild complaint is that they have to make Claire get killed again and again. But overall, Heroes is a complex show that shouldn't be missed.",1312934400,,1096,4.7434554973821985

More than that, I basically feel like I robbed amazon, it was so dirt cheap! And Sylar? One of the most deliciously evil villans i've ever seen( save the Grand Moff Tarkin of Star Wars). Basically, the show revolves around the theory of evolution, which I do not subscribe to, but it puts such a creative spin on it, that it is nearly impossible not to get hooked! Working class ""heroes"" w/ incredible abilities...the coolest of which is Hiro(pun intended). Also, some killer guests....10 stars!!",1311465600,,856,4.6381578947368425
2836252,2,B000QDLSR0,"Most network television is awful (Fox occasionally is ""on"" but then seems to often cancel their best shows when they do get it right.)  This is why I haven't bought a TV in 30 years and only owned one during that time for a few years when someone pitied me for not having one and foisted one on me.  I've seen terrific HBO and Showtime series on DVD, but very little of network TV is even half-tolerable.

So people who watch a lot of TV may not notice what's wrong with this show because they are so used to this wrongness.  It's like someone's been putting dog poo in their food for so long, they say ""yum"" when they get that taste again.  But dog poo is dog poo and not meant to be consumed.  To wit:

1)  It's glacially slow.  You can summarize the whole season in 25 words.
2)  It spends 25% of the time of each show recapping the previous plot points.  So it's slow in the first place, and now it's even slower.  The whole thing could have been a six-episode, commercial-free okay miniseries, like Lost Room (though not nearly that good) with a satisfying ending and been done with for good, and it could have (in that case) been pretty good adventure show.
3)  The dramatic pace is sacrificed for advertisers' needs as timing commercial breaks is the number one priority.  Again, people are so used to this, they don't see what an artistic travesty this is--but it certainly is one.  For this reason, I'd much rather watch mediocre BBC than any NBC.

It does a few things better than average tv.  The blanding-down of characters and situations so typical of American network TV isn't quite as bad here--you do have a sex worker (albeit with a heart of gold, yawn) and a sympathetic heroin addict. (On CBS, they would have blanded them down to a romance novelist and a drunk.)

Other valid points some other negative reviewers have made, and I won't repeat, but I will say I thought the acting was fine and like most people, found Hiro the most engaging of the characters.

Life is short, and spending it watching awful TV to get to something this limp so you can think it's ""good"" is just tragic.  Talk to your kids or take up a musical instrument or read a book instead.",1311206400,2,2178,4.3975

2836254,5,B000QDLSR0,"I purchased this blu-ray after already having the regular dvd set and I am thrilled with it. I really enjoyed this series, especially the first season. Season 1 stands alone as an excellent sci-fi/fantasy series, as well as providing a great starting point for the series as a whole.

Unfortunately, the series began to struggle later on. It never seemed to recover the same audience it had before the Writer's Guild of America strike of 2007-2008, which happened during the show's second season. As a result of the strike, an entire planned story line was cut from the show. This made the third season of the show a little choppy and denied the audience fitting story lines for a couple characters we'd developed some attachment to during the second season.

The show features a story-arc style similar to that of a comic book. This means that any given season can stand alone as a story, without leaving a huge cliffhanger at the end.

So, if you see no other season of Heroes, see THIS one. It is an excellent buy and the special effects are even better in high def.",1309824000,2,1069,4.61578947368421

For a writer (and I am a professional writer/editor) it's a scam. A shell game. Just keep switching everything around, and make audience hints that take years to explain. If it happens that some random combination of writer/director/actor works ... play it up ... as if you knew it would happen all along.

I figure if you don't have me interested by then, you aren't going to.  Needless to say, I own the DVD for all three seasons.  Now, before anyone says I'm just a Heroes lemming that can only give a 5 star review, check out my reviews for the other two seasons.  They aren't 5 star.  This is, however, the only truly awesome season of the series.  I like the other two, but they are nowhere near as good as season one.  It just seemed fresh and not like anything else out there.  Granted, the main characters aren't as fleshed out as they could be, but I can get over it.  There is at least some progression as well.  They aren't the same at the end of the series as they are at the beginning.  Of the bunch, I could have done without the Niki/Jessica character.  She was the weakest of the bunch in my opinion.  Claire can be a bit annoying at times, but I guess I might be the same way if I got a power I didn't really want or didn't know why this was happening to me. Overall, this has a sense of wonder and freshness that is hard to come by in serialized drama.  There are a lot of good drama shows, but they all seem slightly different slants on the same thing.  This show they tried to take the ""normal"" and turn it on its ear.  The first season accomplished that, the other two a little less so.  Haven't seen season four yet, so I can't comment on that.

2836285,4,B000QDLSR0,"I'm not even going to review the show, as many people countless times have said what I already think in other reviews. I'm going to cover the quality of the Blu-Ray, and whether you should upgrade from your DVD/HD-DVD. Needless to say, this season has great acting, a great story, great special effect (for TV), and great writing. It's a shame the series went crazy after Bryan Fuller left after this season, but when he returned in Volume 4 the show became good again. Here's hoping the show keeps the quality up!

VIDEO QUALITY: 3.5

Sadly, Heroes' video quality is pretty disappointing. That's not to say the video quality is bad by any means, but I expect better from a show with such high production value as Heroes.

I'll start off with the positive: The video quality is light-years ahead of the DVD release. Gone is the macro-blocking and over-sharpening of the DVD video, and in is the high detail and bright colors of the Blu-Ray video. With TV shows in general on Blu-Ray, the detail captured on faces in particular makes the difference night and day. Special effects shots are great even if a little blurry (an apparent move to try and hide the show's limited budget), and backgrounds are much more detailed than the HDTV broadcast. Colors like blue, red, and green all jump off of the screen and mesmerize you. Digital noise like artifacting is also kept pretty low for the most part, and the video has much better sharpening than the DVD release. The text for Hiro and Ando's conversations is also easier to read. They were slightly blurry on the DVD release throughout, but they stand out as clear as day in HD.

Now for the bad: The film grain. I'd estimate around 60% of shots in Heroes have noticeable film grain in them, which can obscure detail and sticks out like a sore thumb on white backgrounds. I don't know why such an absurd amount of shots have this, and the only reasons I can guess are: 1) Budgeting caused the producers to go with a lower grade of film. 2) Poor camera set up. 3) It's an artistic move to make the show look like it's on paper (i.e. like a comic book). Either way, the near constant layer of grain can be very distracting, especially in wide shots or shots with white backgrounds. Another major downside is that digital noise pops up randomly in black areas. This is the only place noise appears on a regular basis, and it mostly happens in scenes with Mohinder for some reason. For scenes with other characters like Matt or Peter, the blacks are rich and deep throughout. One last thing is that once in a while it is very obvious when they use digital noise reduction to reduce the amount of grain on the screen. In one shot in particular a white wall in the background had this bizarre flickering effect that none of the other walls in that scene had, and it was very distracting.

Despite the film grain and random noise, Heroes Season One on Blu-Ray is by far the best way to view the show. The colors and facial detail will definitely blow you away as I was when I popped the first disc in.

SOUND QUALITY: 4.0

The sound presentation of Heroes Season One is better than its video presentation, and again exceeds the original DVD audio by leaps and bounds. Voices and sound effects come through very clearly on the 5.1 DTS-HD MA mix, and the new detail from the LFE track helps punctuate the musical score and sound effects much better than the DD mix on the DVD release. Really, until you hear how much detail the LFE track adds to the viewing experience, you don't know what you're missing. My only gripe with the sound presentation is that the mix is mostly front heavy, and very rarely makes use of the rear speakers. I understand that this is only a television show, and that most people watch TV with stereo speakers, but Heroes was one of the shows at the front of the HD revolution when it premiered. Part of the HD revolution is surround sound, and having your show touted as being part of that revolution while not taking full advantage of it is disappointing. If you only have stereo speakers, this makes no difference to you, but it's a bit of a let down for those of us who've invested in surround sound.

PRESENTATION: 5.0

What Heroes Season One lacks in audio and video, it makes up for with a wonderful presentation. This release uses Universal Media's U-Control, which is a standard layout for menus and such for Blu-Ray releases. If you don't know how to use it, there's a little instruction pamphlet included with the packaging, so you don't need to go Googling for help on the internet. After the disc loads, it goes straight to the menu instead of having to sit through piracy warnings and stuff. Speaking of which, you actually have the option to skip all of the promos, warnings, and legal stuff unlike a lot of other Blu-Ray releases (and the original DVD), which instantly makes the presentation awesome. The packaging is also slightly bigger and heavier than the DVD release, but the artwork on the inside is better than the DVD release in my opinion. Because of the bigger space on Blu-Ray discs, the series comes on 5 discs instead of 7 like with the DVD and HD-DVD releases.

SPECIAL FEATURES: 3.5

Heroes Season One comes with all of the special features the DVD had with a few exclusives of its own. This includes deleted scenes for a lot of episodes, some behind the scenes features, audio commentary on the last 12 episodes, and a few PIP commentaries. The (yet again) disappointing part is that most of these special features come in 4:3 480i instead of 16:9 1080p. The hand full that come in HD are the original pilot, the BD-Live stuff, the Artwork Presentations (the Tim Sale artwork featured in Isaac's future paintings) and the Character Connections stuff (essentially a bio of each character on the show).

OVERALL: 4.0

Heroes Season One is the best season of the show so far. As I mentioned before, the show got really stupid for a long time after this until Bryan Fuller came back in the middle of Volume 4. Now Heroes is good again, and we have a pretty good Blu-Ray release of its best season to remember it by. With good video mastering and great audio coupled with good special features and awesome presentation, I recommend this Blu-Ray package to any Heroes fan out there. My only warning about buying this is the price. Right now the price is $50, which is way too much to be reasonable (like most other Blu-Ray releases at the moment). At most, I would only pay about $35 for this release. Anymore than $35 is a rip-off.",1263427200,18,6524,4.551577152600171

2836295,4,B000QDLSR0,"As a long lover of sci-fi superheroes, it is very rare to find anything all that original anymore.  After your first love, and for me it was the X-Men in this genre, most other things look formulaic.

It took me two full episodes to warm to this series.  At first, I thought it was entirely derivative, exactly the same plot as the X-Men:  powerful mutants learn to use their powers, some are good and some bad, while a fearful public stands more or less in the dark as to the truth.  The association of Stan Lee to the production didn't help.

Then I noticed several things that made this better and better in terms of quality.  The characters are quite interesting, from Hiro (the naive Manga enthusiast who relishes his status as superhero) to the complicated family, the Petrellis (one a politician who is vacillating between sleaze and conscience and his younger brother, variously seen as a softie loser and the most powerful of them all).  The acting is quite believable, if at times middling.  And they grow on you as you see alternative futures and the like for them.

Then there is a tongue and cheek joking at the notion behind the entire genre of mutant superheroes, which fans take way way too seriously for their own mental balance.  It is a delicate balance, because while avoiding comedy the viewer needs to suspend their disbelief and just enjoy it.  This really worked for me because it was contained in the characters, not in stupid sit-com style situations.

Finally, the peeling back of layers of conspiracy and intrigue are worthy of the X-Files.  While it is not to everyone's taste, I enjoyed it, particularly in the father of the cheerleader, who rebels and comes out as a good guy if too machiavellian.

Warmly recommended.  It is very fun entertainment.",1252627200,,1780,4.711974110032362

2836298,4,B000QDLSR0,I quite like the series but the interface is on the blu-ray disk is a little quirky.  It also takes a long time to load to the point of playing (about 2 minutes in all from start up) and required me to upgrade my firmware to work on my Blu-ray player.

2836300,5,B000QDLSR0,"I'd gotten this quite a while ago when it was dirt cheap, halfway through&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-2/dp/B001B7CNZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 2</a>. I'd never seen it before but heard many good things. The whole superhero aspect really interested me. So I took a chance.

It starts out slow, giving detailed background information on each character while moving the plot forward at what seems like a snails pace. But as we learn more and more about each character, how they tie together, and what will happen next (or what we THINK will happen), it becomes quite addictive! We are eager to learn the superpowers each of them get, how they use them, and what will happen next. It's a beautiful formula carefully planned out to keep people watching. I've never seen any of the other seasons, so I don't know if they've kept it up. From what I've heard so far they've slipped a bit...but who knows.

What I like best about the DVD itself is the layout of the content, the comicbook style of the chapters. To me this gives the overall feel that we're actually seeing a comicbook, rather than just a show. I love how the extra/deleted scenes are on each disc, rather than colleting them together seperately at the end; this way we don't have to scratch our heads as to where such-n-such scene happened. The ""documentary"" features on the last disc are quite short, but give the viewer a basic overall aspect of how things came together. I would have liked to have seen more details on the original concepts, character creation, and stuff like that. But perhaps its best that we don't know everything; it might spoil the fun of discovering through the show what happened.

Overall I can't recommend this enough. Might want to wait and get it around $20 or so, but I would pay $35 for it as well. This series would be great for kids, and I'd recommend it to people who feel that their meant for something more than just working a job they hate. It allows us to live our fantasy through someone else. And, perhaps, influence us to make changes in our life to do what we're really meant.",1246406400,,2141,4.8283378746594
2836301,4,B000QDLSR0,"The show can occasionally be overly dramatic and unnecessarily violent.  Fortunately, the show also has a distinct sense of humor that counter-balances some of the heavy-handedness.

I can see how some viewers may find Hiro and Ando annoying, but to me they were fun.  Though the show does meander, the writers do a commendable job staying consistent in terms of tone and continuity.  There are numerous beats in early episodes that pay off late in the season.  And the entire season works well as a complete story with each character following a distinct arc.

The show really hits its stride after the ""Homecoming"" episode, which essentially marks the midpoint of the season.  Standout episodes include ""Six Months Ago"", ""Company Man"", and ""Five Years Gone"".  It bears mentioning that the story of Heroes owes *a lot* to The X-Men and Watchmen, however, it manages to establish its own identity with its distinct style.",1244505600,,921,5.0131578947368425

Imagine watching a 16.5-hour movie where the storyline/s are consolidating into a one non-progressing plot with characters that change but do not grow. The only suspense that kept me rooted to the screen was the question of ""who's Sylar's next protagonist-victim?"" The psychology of the evil Mother-influence was plumbed out (Sylar's, Nathan's, etc). I wept when they killed the old Hiro, I was hoping that they do the young one. The narration's too cryptic and tiring. If you haven't watched the TV series, watch the compilation in installments. Caveat emptor: it's a 16.5-hour movie that begs you to watch an another 16.5-hour sequel. And, oh yes, the bad guy's still alive.",1242777600,,826,4.9071428571428575
2836305,1,B000QDLSR0,"About four years ago, I suffered a very nasty bout of food poisoning after copping a dodgy squid in a restaurant while on holiday in Athens, Greece. For the better part of a day and a night, my bowels were in a state that can only be described as 'Lovecraftian'. They spent every waking moment excreting a hideous, ichorous, noxious effluvia of the kind one would only generally expect to see following the disturbance of a mass war grave. It is only now, with the benefit of hindsight, that I notice a distinct similarity between the things that I evacuated that day and the final episode of Season One of 'Heroes'.

Seriously, I have never seen a more anti-climatic, self-indulgent, overly-sentimentalised piece of badly written nonsense than 'how to stop an exploding man'. The twee American penchant for attempting to sledgehammer yawnsome, trite, old 'love-conquers-all' and 'with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility' morality into every single frame of the final forty five minutes became so nauseatingly irritating that I found myself checking the DVD player to make sure that I wasn't accidentally watching a 'She-Ra' DVD.

Unfortunately, this pretty much sums up this series as a whole - a promising concept squandered due to pedestrian execution, bland performances and tedious moralising.

Consider my chips cashed and the Casino vacated as far as that series is concerned.

Unlike Lost which follows a similiar format, Heroes does take the time to develop each character througout all three seasons.

In fact, after the pilot episode I gave up, until this year when I caught season 3 episodes and it made me realize I've been missing an amazing show. So amazing I had to rent every Heroes DVD and request both seasons 1 & 2 dvd sets. I still wasn't crazy about the Pilot when I saw it again recently, but I loved the realistic approach to super-heroes.

I'm a big fan of Smallville so no surprise Heroes won me over. There are lots of characters and many of them are very likeable. So many in fact that I can't pick ONE favorite because a lot of them are my favorites - like Hiro who can teleport through time and space and make me laugh every episode along with his human side-kick Ando, Claire Bennett who heals from anything like Wolverine, Peter (who could copy any powers of a super-human he comes into contact with) & Nathan (who can fly) brothers with powers, but different viewpoints, there's Matt the psychic cop/part time F.B.I agent who is trying to find out what happened to him and others like him who have suddenly become more than human. there's Nikki/Jennifer who are sisters one good and one bad, one dead  and one alive but they switch places when they ""see"" each other in mirrors and reflective objects, there's Angela Petrelli, the manipulative mother of the Petrelli brothers (Nathan and Peter), there's Mikah, Nikki's son who can control machines, there's DL the husband of Nikki and father of Mikah who can become intangible and walk through walls Finally, there is HRG the cunning, manipulative ""father"" of Claire and Sylar the show's version of Lex Luthor who kills to take other people's powers.. The stories are fantastic and in this first season this show brought a positive vibe that many tv shows lack these days (heck even Heroes has become a ""dark"" and brooding show).

If you've never seen Heroes you don't know what you are missing. There are those fans that think the show has declined, but I think it gets better every week. I'm glad I finally started watching this show and now buy it on dvd. It's already become my favorite show.

2836325,5,B000QDLSR0,"I will start by saying that I am biased -- I liked comic books as a kids, watched all sorts of cartoons on Saturday mornings, and dressed up as various heroes for Halloween. Obviously, I enjoyed this season of Heroes quite a bit.

My wife, on the other hand, has no such predispositons and generally does NOT enjoy anything superhero, science fiction or computer-related.  We heard a lot about the show, but did not watch it until we purchased the DVD set -- then we watched the episodes three or four at a time.  The story is just that good. (We would have watched more, but we have jobs, kids, and other responsibiliies)

The producers seem to strongly promote the theory of evolution,  mildly promote teen suicidal attempts, etc.  In general, if you're looking for a good sci-fi with high morals, and some family values more like Smallville promotes, you might would rather watch,  well...

2836329,5,B000QDLSR0,"For those like me who missed episodes, had gaps from interruptions or had failing attention, Heroes 1st season is a pleasant reintroduction to the beginning of the Heroes series.  I haven't seen a quality sci-fi program that wasn't worthwhile seeing again, and you usually find elements not seen the first time.

A DVD set, obviously, provides a very good long term storage system for quality video images and stereo sound. And it's a far better storage system than VHS tape.  Technology is always marching on, and DVD is safe for 5-10 years.  Most advances are incremental steps; choose your shots well.

So, I'll be getting the additional years/ seasons as they are available.

2836336,4,B000QDLSR0,"There has been a fair bit of hype surrounding this series, and most of it is deserved, so if you have checked out some of the best television has to offer (and the 21st century has some of the finest ever) then you may like to give Heroes a flight on your screen. I am in for season 2 and maybe you will be also.

The show deals with about a dozen characters, each who discovers they have a special ability, their lives cross each other's and in the backdrop a looming crisis threatens each of them, New York and maybe the entire world. They must learn to come to terms with their abilities before it is too late.

The season starts by explaining the characters and further episodes gradually bring the characters together. This is a bit of a slow burner but stick with it because the second half of this season is a way better than the first which does have some shaky moments and a few off episodes that can make you doubt it. For every low point there genuinely are some very interesting and surprising ones.  However one of its major weaknesses is that it cannot escape being labelled an X-Men clone and for all intents and purposes that is exactly what it is. It's the exact same premise dilemma of humans possibly turning against the new mutant emergences, however instead of focusing on this the series is mainly about Sylar, a mutant who becomes an increasingly dangerous force and tries to kill the other mutants. In this respect it hasn't fallen victim to being a complete X-Men rip-off but it does come too close for comfort sometimes.

The other problem is that for every interesting character (with the emergence of a new actor in the making) there is one that is boring or whose potential is kept to such a minimal as to barely make them appealing enough to watch when they show up. While this could just be the producers playing some things out for future seasons it is still more than a little tedious and in particular doesn't suit its style like it would in Lost. This is Heroes. We want heroes. If we want Lost we will watch Lost. One other negative is that the story often doesn't make sense and some characters do some very silly things but this is all about the suspension of disbelief, they just ask us to buy into some things that make everyone concerned look very dim. There is a bit of an anti-climax too given such a build up.

So apart from its failing why recommend it? Well it should be highly suggested for your TV series collection because its production values are consistent with the best of TV along with some nifty plots and some truly exciting story arcs. For example Hero's very tough version of himself,  Sylar's method of killing people, Claire taking her date for a drive, Peter discovering how his powers actually work or Matt's family dilemmas.  Some heroes live and some die so that keeps you on your toes.

It seems that its plus points are more than enough to not only save it from gathering dust but propel it into competing for the best TV series hot spot. When its goods it's great and when it tries to touch its audience it really succeeds.

Pros:
-High production values
-Cool characters
-Good action sequences
-When the story works its very cool

Cons:
-X-Men does it better
-Some characters are boring or stay small
-Anti-climax
-Plot holes galore",1224115200,,3300,4.5125628140703515
2836337,5,B000QDLSR0,"There are only two negative things to say in reference to Heroes Season 1 on Blu-ray...and neither of them have anything to do with the show itself.

1) Like all television series sets (on Blu-ray and DVD both, but especially on Blu-Ray) the price is far too high to be reasonable.

2) There didn't seem to be much by way of additional special features to be found on the Blu-ray set beyond those that were on the standard DVD set (or, I might add, the HD-DVD set).

The shear volume of hype around Heroes convinced us to give this try without ever seeing a single episode of the show.

Like all Sci-Fi, Heroes requires some suspension of disbelief to get full enjoyment, but this series hits on so many levels (action, humor, special effects, and solid plot). This first season episodes were so compelling that we seldom watched just one episode per sitting (sometimes four of them back to back, keeping us up into the wee hours of the morning :-)

2836352,5,B000QDLSR0,"To fans of the show the title of my review is likely something that has stuck in their minds since they first heard it two years ago. It was the definitive tag line for a truly unique TV show with quite a familiar premise. Think the birth of X-Men crossed with real life, each mutant has just discovered their powers for the first time and the notion of mutants is unknown to the world. Taking that simple description would give you the basic idea of what the show's about, but it's much better and much more complicated than that.

Season 1 is the dawning of a new evolutionary stage for humans, some are born with superpowers such as Flight, Invisibility and the ability to heal etc. The show follows a number of different people at different stages in the discovery process. Some have been familiar with their situation for a long time and have actually either come to embrace their discovered power or hate it. To some super strength would be a blessing, but to some it would be a true curse to the hero and their family. Of course with the good guys discovering their powers, Heroes season 1 has the ultimate bad guy who can steal the powers of others by devouring their brains.

There are four main characters to this season along with a bunch of excellent supporting actors. The main four are Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka), Peter Petrelli (Milo Ventimiglia), Sylar (Zachary Quinto) & Claire Bennett (Hayden Panettiere). There are quite a few different stories that intertwine to the ultimate season finale, so below is my brief description of the 4 main characters individual stories.

Claire Bennett: In October 2006 she discovers that she has the ability of spontaneous regeneration after an accident that leads to the cutting of her hand and a few days later the cut completely disappearing. Completely freaked out by this, Claire starts to experiment with her new ability with the help of her classmate Zach. She continues with a number of self harming incidents that would show her the extent of her ability.

Hiro Nakamura: One day while in his office cubicle, Hiro discovers he has the ability to manipulate time and space allowing him to stop time or teleport himself to any period and any location on Earth. He's a regular comic book nerd and becomes excited by his powers and along with his friend Ando seeks to become the Hero he's always dreamed of being.

Peter Petrelli: He's the brother of Politician Nathan Petrelli (Ability to Fly) and Peter first discovers that he has the ability to fly. Being freaked out by this fact he tries to convince his brother Nathan who's more pre-occupied with his own political ambitions. Throughout the season Peter becomes aware that it's not the ability to fly that is his power, rather he has the ability to absorb the powers of others with which he has no control over. This leads to Peter absorbing a power that would ultimately bring together all other heroes in the ultimate climax.

Sylar: He's been called by many external reviewers, magazines and TV shows as the most evil TV villain of the 21st century. That is truly no understatement as Sylar is possibly the most evil and intimidating person I've seen on TV in years. We ever truly come to know what Sylars initial ability is, but he does have the ability to steal other peoples powers by killing them and taking their brain. What he does with it, we have yet to find out. He's the man that not only are people scared of, but he becomes another primary catalyst in the finale build up.

There are quite a few side characters and stories, which for this season I don't think they really had much of a point rather than to pass the time and help out here and there. I will say this, however and that is that season 1 really set in stone an amazing show that from start to finish is extremely enjoyable. The performance by Quinto as the villainous Sylar is just unbelievable and he's become a cult fan favourite, simply because of his complex and evil nature. I would highly recommend this show to anyone as the special effects are unmatched and the acting is top notch.",1220054400,,4081,4.620689655172414

2836355,3,B000QDLSR0,"I'm a guy that loves shows like Lost and 24. I love shows with rich, interesting stories with characters I not only can relate to, but also really enjoy seeing when they're on the screen. When I heard about the premise for Heroes, it seemed like it was right up my alley.

So, I ordered the season. I watched the first episode. Not my favorite, I thought. Still, I remember having watched the first few episodes of Battlestar Galactica, hating them, then after a while, grew to love the series. I hoped for an experience that would reward the time I took to watch it. I thought to myself, ""Hey, it's alright... sometimes it takes a show to stand up on it's own two feet.""

Turns out I'm just a sucker. Despite the hype, I just don't like any of the characters, save for maybe Hiro- and that's definitely a maybe. The characters are all so self-absorbed and pretentious that after each episode, I no longer got the feeling of ""What's going to heppen next?"" Instead, it was ""Is there any way to make this guy or girl likable?"" After watching the entire first season, the answer is a resounding No, pretty much all of them remain obsessed with their own problems and ego, with exception to Hiro and Nathan Petrelli.

The other problem with the show is similar to the problems faced by the last couple seasons of Alias- No substance. There would be plot twists, sure, but there would be nothing that would seriously alter the course of events. There's a point where the series turns just plain boring. In addition, there are plenty of times where someone says something vague, and you're meant to expect it to be deep and meaningful, but when the audience finds out exactly what they mean, you find out that it wasn't deep, and the reveal is so disappointing that it's annoying. And Saresh? Easily the most egotistical and pretentious one of them all. The fact they've made him the narrator is infuriating.

Why did I give it three stars? The last few episodes. They're actually pretty good, plus the ""5 years into the future episode."" Not bad at all. If they made the entire series like those episodes, this would have been a great series. Also, Hiro starts out as being pretty annoying. I'm a dork (An engineer by day), and I was meant to relate to him... but geez. However, his character gets developed into someone I actually liked seeing at the end.

So, to conclude- Great concept, horrible characters, poor writing. Don't expect Lost with superpowers. Expect X-men, only much more drawn out and wolverine is a cheerleader, without the aweosme blades.",1218931200,,2553,4.626931567328918

Every turn of the corner is a new twist.  Also, the level of violence in this show surprised me as it's a network show.  This show is a slightly watered down version of X-Men.",1218844800,,535,4.29

The one things I noticed, though, was a distinct lack of fun. It's all drama and angst, especially for Nikki and Peter. Hiro and Ando make up for a lot of it, but it's still very much present.

2836361,3,B000QDLSR0,"They thought they were like everyone else... until they woke with incredible abilities.

My Review:

What's that you hear? ""A show based on humans with superpowers?"" ""Hasn't this been done before?"" Well, yes; a new show created by producer and writer Tim Kring sees people all over the world discovering their newfound abilities in their own ways, more like X-Men for the common folk. Course with that being said, the characters are...well...common folk.

With several interesting plots that only seem to compare to the 'The 4400' which bares the story of people who are genetically enhanced and sent time-travelling to a specific place in time to alter history, it's fair to say that Heroes does neither of this, or travel in any direction in any shape or form.

The show itself has several interesting features that try to distinguish itself from other Sci-Fi orientated shows, with that in mind it plays along the lines of a comic book. It shoots in panoramic, comic book Neo-Dickenson visuals, all the while giving off a false sense of satisfaction. You don't feel hyped or excited by the scene, but a sense of need seems to surround it, a feeling of basic display and no colour; just to pass off a particular story section for the need to get to the next.

Loose and sad stories lace screen time, with great belligerence that encompasses each episode with it trying to rival hard hitting drama like '24' or the recently successful 'Lost'. The score is unimpressive and feels downtrodden. It seems to play on depression; the characters themselves are not worth invested time as they don't have anything to connect with an audience with. They play on simple domestic, melodramatic exertion and struggles, far too two dimensional and that's with a big fat '2'. The overall themes are asinine and very juvenile, some cases it tries to push that boundary but untimely falls back into the skim of things.

With that also being said, the show has interesting CGI special effects the never really get the boot to amazing. The episodic structure fills the time with multiple story arcs of various characters; however it becomes a bit haywire as you seem to forget where the characters story left off when starting on a following episode. Some powers of the characters seem original, but focus is veered away on the idea on them dealing with a greater individuality and purpose on how they should face that fact that they are different; them adjusting, not on how they are different.

The stories are so bleak that they become spread across multiple episodes for filler value and farther spread than tiny amounts of butter on toast. There is nothing to clench, no particular purpose when literally nothing happens in the episodes. True that like most realistic stories; usually nothing happens, but it seems to reinforce that belief further and further. The main problem is hype, or the constant overbearing need this show has to bare its need for audience. There are never enough questions, or any pondering, in fact in some cases you just don't care about ""Who killed who?"" or ""Why did he do that?""

Verdict:

Colourful, lacks visual beguilement, entertaining pop corn show, with a side order of dementia that you wouldn't mind having after each episode. Enjoy it while it lasts, savour it before it becomes tasteless. 7/10.",1216252800,2,3321,4.8845470692717585

All of the plotlines are so intricate and each character has so much to give that it just amazes me that they got such a great cast that works well with each other.  I really liked all of the characters although I would have to say that Hiro and Ando were my favorite.  The whole plot line of people with special powers wasn't cheesy at all and you could relate to these people who aren't perfect and just looking for there little place in the world.  The action kept you on the seat wanting to watch the next episode and hoping that Sylar would be caught and that you would finally find out who Mr. Linderman was.  This really was a great DVD and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.,1216080000,,798,4.1558441558441555

2836367,5,B000QDLSR0,"What if you discovered that you had a superpower -- great strength, flight, teleportation, or amazing healing? And what if you could use it to save the world?

Superheroes are everywhere in entertainment, from comic books to movies. But few manage to be as intelligent, geeky and well-written as ""Heroes,"" a solid comic-book style TV series that explores the repercussions of several ""ordinary"" people who discover that they have strange -- and sometimes dangerous -- powers.

It opens with Mohinder Suresh (Sendhil Ramamurthy) reflecting on the human quest for knowledge -- even knowledge that we shouldn't have -- right before learning that his father has been killed, possibly murdered. Suresh's dad believed that ""special"" people were cropping up, much like in X-Men.

And we are introduced to the ""heroes"": stripper Niki (Ali Larter) harbors a secret dark side, cheerleader Claire (Hayden Panettiere) heals from any injury, Japanese Dilbert Hiro (Masi Oka) can bend time and space, Senatorial candidate Nathan (Adrian Pasdar) is able to fly, his brother Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) can copy others' powers, a cop Matt (Greg Grunberg) can read minds, and junkie artist Isaac (Santiago Cabrera) sees the future. There are plenty of others that show up, but these start the ball rolling.

While Claire and Hiro explore the potential of their new powers, Niki and her son try to elude some hired thugs --and end up overwhelmed by her dark side, and framed. And Suresh searches for the answer to his father's death, only to find that his genetics research is involved with the ""special people,"" and that a superpowered serial killer is targeting them.

Even worse, Hiro takes a trip to New York (five weeks in the future), and sees the city destroyed by a massive blast -- as does Isaac, through his paintings. How to stop it? As a future Hiro tells them, ""save the cheerleader, save the world."" The Heroes begin slowly coming into contact, in a haze of dreams, visions, murder, swords and death -- and to stop the serial killer and save New York, more sacrifices may be made...

Unlike most shows about people with superpowers, ""Heroes"" isn't really about the action or flashy battles. It's half epic save-the-world-as-a-team story, and half exploration of how real, ordinary people would react if they suddenly found out that they had superpowers, and how this would change -- or NOT change -- their lives.

The storylines are incredibly intricate and complex, since there are a dozen subplots and a lot of time travel, and plenty of hints at future events. The careful painting of all these storylines even further in two episodes, one of which shows the pre-Heroic lies of the characters (and how Syler became a murderous terror), and another that shows what the future will be like if they don't change it. It's not a pretty picture.

These complex storylines are enhanced by lots of suspense and tightly directed action, and the makers always know how to throw in a shocking twist, such as a sword-carrying future Hiro showing up.. But there is also some poignancy, and very dark humor from time to time (Claire waking up in mid-autopsy, or twisting her broken neck around). Not to mention some great, sometimes geeky dialogue (""Where did you learn all this?"" ""X-men No. 143 when Kitty Pryde time travels!"").

The actors are pretty much all good -- Larter gives a great double performance, Zachary Quinto is a wonderfully twisted villain, and Panettiere gives a good performance as a teen whose adolescence has a lot more than hormones in store. Masi Oka is the standout, though -- his Hiro is sweet, endearing, geeky, heroic, sad, kindly, funny and thoroughly lovable. The scene where he arrives in New York is adorable.

The ""Heroes"" are only starting their journey, and the first season of this geeky hit is a must-see for fans of intelligent sci-fi drama. And I doubt their journey is over...",1213920000,,3899,4.938931297709924
2836368,5,B000QDLSR0,"When this show launched I was only able to see 3 episodes, That little taste always left me wanting to see more.

Overall point of the story is, people are changing, and becoming super... more akin to X-Men than any other Comic inspired media.

Tho thats where the simularities stop, the charachters them selves are a lot more interesting for the most part, and the abilities of the charachters are usefull and interesting, where as you do not see lame charachters like aquaman or something akin to a frog..

The story itself is an inerwoven web of multiple stories and plots, at times this gets annoying since wave after wave of new wrinkles are added in, but i say annoying cause your always at the edge of your seat, and when an episode stops you just want more... makes you almost understand what the charachter Isaac is going through.

Some problems I have with this show is the Charachters are not as smart as you'd hope, I do realize that this a show and is supposed to be entertainment. But why go to 1940 germany to kill hitler, if you can just as well teleport back when he was a boy and take care of him the easy way? I use this refrence as a way of not leaking the story of the over all show.

Overall a great show, very edgey and clean. Defenitly not for young children, there is a good amount of blood and graphic violence.",1213833600,,1337,4.353413654618474

Nathan is Heroes version of Professor Xavier, but he is young and just learning his limits, or lack thereof.  Claire, the Cheerleader, is Wolverine without the claws.  I could go on, but the point is this, if you like X-men you'll love this.  It is definitely for an older crowd, though; there is lots of violence that doesn't even stop with death.

2836372,5,B000QDLSR0,"Very nice series that is excellently written and performed, but contains some gruesome aspects so it may not be suitable for everyone.  However, there are many INTERESTING aspects as well so I can highly recommend this series.  Characters and the main season overal story are developed over roughly 24 episodes on 7 DVDs.  If you are looking for a type of Sci-Fi series that is on Earth and is made up of slowly discovering the special abilities of people living somewhat normal lives, then THIS is it!  It is never clear who are the ""good guys"" and who are the ""bad guys"" which makes it even more exciting.  Here are some details on the disks:

1.  Cases: could be better as they use the hard polycarbonate (?) style where each two disks overlap -- why? the disks are not so easy to remove.  Users want slim-pack, polypropylene cases so that the disks are easy to remove.

2.  Disks: single-sided as they should be and they appear to be of good quality with no pixelation and so on.

3.  Menus: each disk has a menu but they are not so easy to access later episodes.  The TOP menu should contain a listing of all episodes.

4.  Price: I picked mine up from amazon when they were about $23, so wait a while for the sale if you can.  However, even at the usual discounted price of $38, the series are worth picking up.  The 7 DVDs for the set are an excellent value and will entertain for hours.",1212105600,,1394,4.361867704280155
2836373,4,B000QDLSR0,"When I first started watching Heroes, I got hooked on it almost instantly. However, after a few (well maybe more like 10+) episodes, it somehow felt a little... empty. Almost every episode ends with a cliff-hanger, which detracts from the satisfaction in viewing. Granted, it's a surefire way of making viewers want to go on watching, but it feels kinda manipulative. Compared with another series such as Veronica Mars for example, Heroes feels like it's not going anywhere fast, plot-wise.

Regardless, the subject matter is interesting, the characters' acting are generally great, and the plot is not too shabby. I'll actually give it 4.5 stars except the available options are either 4 or 5, and I really can't give it a perfect, flawless 5-stars.

Hence if you're the type who likes to watch just 1 or 2 episodes at a go, Heroes might not feel really satisfying. However if you have an entire weekend to dedicate to this, by all means immense yourself in the world of Heroes.",1212105600,,979,4.821428571428571

Since then I have found that NBC Universal DVD sets are well-known for this shoddy quality, especially when bearing the ""Made in Mexico"" stamp on the cellophane.  (Google it - collectors of DVD sets for old TV shows seem especially aware of this.)  Apparently one or more of their Mexican facilities are not being maintained properly.

2836384,5,B000QDLSR0,"This series surprised me. Many genetic evolutionary films are out there but this one was intriguing. I actually was expecting the usual saga about ordinary heroes, but the twist on this series is very unique and stimulating to my imagination. Genetic mutation and evolution with these kinds of major changes in the human brain, with the amazing powers that are similar to many super heroes, is very interesting to me and has kept my attention throughout. I am fascinated with how the story unfolds and how the genetic traits are becoming more and more evident in the population. The ""killer"" or villain,  is insane and does not seem to have a clue about the value of the gifts that are manifesting.

I am writing a book about a person who possesses unusual powers but it is typical of his race and is not out of the ordinary involving humans of earth. He is not an Earthling.

This story is quite uniquely developed involving our species becoming super heroes, which if the mind and spirit do not develop along with the powers, leaves us in a predicament of responding to them in terms of how we can use them to our advantage and not to the good of our world and each other, which is the logical reason for such development. Spirit must be in the changes or they are again left to abuse and even lost.

The pondering of such a possibility is not far fetched to me probably because nothing would really surprise me at this point in my life, but this story did peak my interest because of the way it is presented and the theories behind it. Perhaps it is unrealistic at this time for humans to think that this could happen because I truly believe that we are de-evolving because of our stress and health issues involving the degrading of our DNA and the earth. Plausibly, radiation would be a reasonable cause of such mutations, but when one thinks about how life has evolved here, before the onset of pollution, plundering and the destruction of the earth, one can see how it could be possible for the ""unused"" parts of our brain to ""come to life"" with evolutionary progress.

Although I tend to relate to things in terms of possibilities with a bit of a stretch of my imagination, I do think that such a tale has a real possibility for mankind's future, if he can stop his dysfunctional determination to run towards destruction! I like the characters and how they are played so close to the edge of danger. However, it is not fun to watch them get killed off after you form some affection for them.

I like the idea of developing such abilities. This show explores how it might be if such things began to happen. The usual fear factor brings in the destroyers, the amazed creators, the curious scientists and the excited discoverers. I would hope the military doesn't get involved and that the show reveals positive integration of some kind.

It does seem difficult to believe that this genetic change should happen at a certain time in the adults because I would think that this kind of change is in the person from the beginning and probably would manifest in some ways as they grew; like Superman did! But, that aside, it  adds good mystery to the show because it happens this way. Why remains to be seen! Did the government do it? Aliens? True genetic mutation and evolution? I am staying to find out. There's a lot of innuendo toward different potential culprits, but the government or human causation seems the most likely truth. Yet, it could still be based in evolutionary trends. Being educated certainly allows for some deep thinking, but as well, some good entertainment! In a way this show is brain candy! And some nice eye candy as added enjoyment. Good job, creative and imaginative. These days, new themes are hard to come by and old themes must be very unique to grab our interest because we've all seen them many times over.

I really like the show and am enjoying watching the DVD's without commercials! What a great relief it is! It ranks up there with creative, imaginative, good quality movie-making and interesting plots. It a keeper.",1210809600,,4056,4.614424410540916

2836387,3,B000QDLSR0,"Heroes is all ""long term plot"" and has a lot of potential to be intelligent and interesting.  The long term plot shows how homeland security and fear can be used for genocide and facism which you have to commend.  The execution of the story line, however, makes this show only mediocre.  It is hard to know where to begin with flaws.  One of the major let downs is the lack of action.  A story based on super powers has so much potential for interesting action, however, there is hardly any action in the show!  The fight scenes are always really, really short and cut away from showing the ""heroes"" actually use their super powers in interesting ways.

Some of the actors really pull down the show.  Hayden Panetierre (the cheerleader) is awful!  She just cannot act, and since she is a major character it really negatively impacts the show.  It is painful to watch the totally unbelievable emotions on her face, and when she ""cries"" huge, fake Visine tears plop down her cheeks.  The actor who plays her father is also really limited, he does an ok creepy bad guy, but cannot show any other emotional range, and really struggles in the episode that features him.  The Indian scientist is also a bad actor.  He looks like an underwear model, and is totally unbelievable as a scientist.  The voice over narration they have him do is so retarded!  They try to make his narration sound really deep but it comes off as nonsense.  I guess they think that just because he has a British accent his narration will sound intelligent.

Nicky, the character played by Ali Larter is totally stupid.  Larter is a good actor, but her super power is ridiculous - she has a split personality, the evil ""Jessica"" who she talks to in the mirror.  That's it!  They build up all these scenes around her mean evil twin who has super strength, but all they do is stare at each other in broken shards of glass or any reflective surface.  She doesn't connect in a meaningful way to the long term plot, and her scenes are quite boring as a result.

The politician who can fly is one dimensional and never flies.  I could go on and on about the small flaws that all add up to a disappointing show that has so much potential!  The best character, and actor, is Hiro who can stop time.  He lights up every scene. But they have the subtitles in his scenes jump all around the screen which is completely distracting to the eyes.  They have a comic book theme to the show, so I guess they are trying to make the subtitles look like captions in a comic.  But it is already distracting for the eye to move between a subtitle and the characters, and when you don't know where on the screen the subtitle is going to appear it makes your eyes hurt.

This show is definitely watchable, but you will find yourself irritated that it wasn't better executed.",1210723200,4,2818,4.472549019607843
2836388,5,B000QDLSR0,"First off I don't own the DVD...well it's supposed to have already come but there was some mix up so...anywho-I have only seen this show as it was originally broadcast and I probably missed an episode here and there so I won't even attempt to delve into the plot of the entire series as some reviewers have done. What I will say is that if you like time travel stories to the past or the future, or if you like stories involving people, both good and bad, with extraordinary abilities and powers, or if you like great writing and deep characters that you come to care about, then this is the show for you.

As an aside, this is a long story arc show with a lot of mid-episode cliff-hangers that is especially well-suited to watching on DVD.

A network television show about people with superheroes sounded to me like it had potential, but would probably be executed poorly (like most superhero movies).  The first couple episodes didn't dissuade me from this notion.  I'm glad I watched it on DVD, because I probably would have stopped watching if I had to wait between episodes.

Early in the show, its constant attempt to explain genetics/evolution is painful to anyone who actually has a passing understanding of it (a trait that continues through the show, but becomes much less frequent), and some of the characters are just plain annoying.

Fortunately, after about the first half dozen episodes, the show starts to get interesting, and with about the last 6 or so, it's hard to stop watching (it caused me to be half-asleep at work on one or two occasions).  The characters start getting better and more interesting , and most of the ones that were awkward/annoying early on made up for it by really coming into their own towards the end).

Quietly, in the house, I could take my own notes, make my own observations, and draw my own conclusions.
  It takes a unique mind to be able to tell eight separate stories and draw all those stories into one large story.  This is what Tim Kring's goal seems to be in Season One.  The odd and unique thing is that Kring really doesn't seem to put this whole fable together in an awkward and disjointed manner; as a result Kring accomplishes the goal in a spectacular and wonderful manner.  It has been said many times over that good science fiction comes more from the characters than the premise.  Such is the case here.  This is a story that has an amazing ensemble of actors working with brilliantly fleshed-out characters.
  As a result of this, to me no one character of the heroes sticks out over the other--as many people love Masi Oka's wonderfully sweet Hiro, others love Hayden Panetierre's coming of age with Claire; or Greg Grunberg's Matt Parkman, and Matt getting used to hearing the thoughts of other people.  Other's love Adrian Pasdar, who channels a little bit of his old Jim Profitt character into Nathan; while others love Milo Ventimiglia's Peter because of his uncertainty as his powers develop but his belief in doing what's right.
  The one performance that knocked me off my feet in this season...of all people...was Ali Larter, and her split personas of Niki and the super-strong Jessica.  Just when Larter seemed destined to be remembered for the Final Destination movies and her whipped-cream bikini in Varsity Blues, she effects a dual role that left me wondering at times if, in fact, Jessica was the real person instead of Niki.  Plus, her work with Noah Gray-Cabey and D.L. Roberts stood out to me.
  But again, all the performances in this freshman season.  Santiago Cabrera's tortured Issac Mendez.  George Takei as Hiro's father.  The absolutely brilliant James Kyson Lee, whose Ando was Sancho Panza to Hiro's Man of La Mancha.  Zachary Quinto, who gave depth and danger to Sylar.  Gray-Cabey and Roberts.  Tawny Cypress.  Sendhil Ramamurthty, who ties all the protagonists together as Mohinder Suresh.  Jack Coleman, who had to effect two separate personalities (Noah Bennett and HRG) much in the same way that Larter did.
  Again, I pay all credit to Tim Kring.  He had characters starting off in all separate places, introduced them and their skills, and slowly brought them together for a wonderful climax at the end of the season.  Also, I would be remiss in not mentioning Tim Sale's wonderful artwork.  His paintings, which were used as Issac Mendez' future-predicting visions, were incredible.  Plus the music score for the series--wonderfully done by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, or as they said in the special feature about the music for the series, ""THAT Wendy and Lisa...""; the former members of Prince and The Revolution back in the day.
  I really wanted to be cynical about all the hype about ""Heroes"".  Simply put, I really didn't believe it could be as good as everyone thought.  But more times than not through Season One, it was better than good--it could be great, brilliant, heart-wrenching (If not heart-breaking)...
  In short--and if you read the title of this review, you knew this was coming--Heroes: Season One was all that...",1208476800,,3518,4.86026936026936

 This show is one of my two favourite shows ever. It has many different twists and turns in every episode of the season and has two arch story lines for each half of the season one built on the other so your not waiting a whole season for a build up but rather a build up with another build up right onto it. I would say this is by far the most popular show running to date and is worth four times the price it truely is one in a million. This show consists of characters who can fly, re-generate, paint the future, cast illusions, bend time and space. But it isn't like normal hero situations, they deal with it as we would in real life some run scared and some try to save the world and at one point its save the cheerleader save the world",1207526400,,747,4.04054054054054

2836404,3,B000QDLSR0,"I'd like to say first that this is without a doubt the best presentation of Heroes season 1 available.  The video quality of these discs is far superior to the NBC broadcasts, but still leaves something to be desired.

The disc come packaged in a handsome box set, smartly packaged on their boards instead of being stacked.  The visual quality of each episode seems to vary greatly.  As is often the case with material shot on high def, lighter scenes tend to look great, while very dark scenes are plagued by grain and other video noise.  Make no mistake, these episodes all look great.  Colors are vivid, contrast is sharp, and there are few instances of compression artifacting (commonplace when dealing with highly compressed digital video).

This set also boasts some nice special features.  The commentary tracks often include several cast members along with the standard writer director combination.  This seems to keep the commentaries from ever growing stale or too technical, as the cast brings more a lay persons reading to the tracks.  The other bonuses, e.g. which superhero are you, are okay, but nothing special.  When HDDVD was still a valid format, one of the few advantages it had over BLU-ray was it's support of web-enabled content as well as support for multiple video streams.  Take a look at the fast and the furious HDDVD special features; you can customize a car with your remote, apply the changes to a specific scene, and watch your car cruise around seamlessly integrated into the movie.  That was amazing.  On these discs the potential of the HDDVD's bonus content capabilities are largely overlooked.  Specifically the online content is really nothing more than a slow webpage.

For me these discs weren't great, merely ""good enough"".  These are clearly a step up in terms of visual quality from the HD broadcasts, but they don't really wow me the way other HDDVD releases did.  To reiterate good, but not great.

2836413,3,B000QDLSR0,"Plot:

They thought they were like everyone else... until they woke with incredible abilities.

My Review:

What's that you hear? ""A show based on humans with superpowers?"" ""Hasn't this been done before?"" Well, yes; a new show created by producer and writer Tim Kring sees people all over the world discovering their newfound abilities in their own ways, more like X-Men for the common folk. Course with that being said, the characters are...well...common folk.

With several interesting plots that only seem to compare to the 'The 4400' which bares the story of people who are genetically enhanced and sent time-travelling to a specific place in time to alter history, it's fair to say that Heroes does neither of this, or travel in any direction in any shape or form.

The show itself has several interesting features that try to distinguish itself from other Sci-Fi orientated shows, with that in mind it plays along the lines of a comic book. It shoots in panoramic, comic book Neo-Dickenson visuals, all the while giving off a false sense of satisfaction. You don't feel hyped or excited by the scene, but a sense of need seems to surround it, a feeling of basic display and no colour; just to pass off a particular story section for the need to get to the next.

Hard-pressed sardonic values lace the screen time, with great belligerence that encompasses each episode with it trying to rival hard hitting drama like '24' or the recently successful 'Lost'. The score is unimpressive and feels downtrodden. It seems to play on depression; the characters themselves are not worth invested time as they don't have anything to connect with an audience with. They play on simple domestic, mellow dramatic exertion and struggles, far too two dimensional and that's with a big fat '2'. The overall themes are asinine and very juvenile, some cases it tries to push that boundary but untimely falls back into the skim of things.

With that also being said, the show has interesting CGI special effects the never really get the boot to amazing. The episodic structure fills the time with multiple story arcs of various characters; however it becomes a bit misconstrued as you seem to forget where the characters story left off when starting on a following episode. Some powers of the characters seem original, but focus is veered away on the idea on them dealing with a greater individuality and purpose on how they should face that fact that they are different; them adjusting, not on how they are different.

The stories are so bleak that they become spread across multiple episodes for filler value and farther spread than tiny amounts of butter on toast. There is nothing to clench, no particular purpose when literally nothing happens in the episodes. True that like most realistic stories; usually nothing happens, but it seems to reinforce that belief further and further. The main problem is hype, or the constant overbearing need this show has to bare its need for audience. There are never enough questions, or any pondering, in fact in some cases you just don't care about ""Who killed who?"" or ""Why did he do that?""

Verdict:

Colourful, lacks visual beguilement, entertaining pop corn show, with a side order of dementia that you wouldn't mind having after each episode. Enjoy it while it lasts, savour it before it becomes tasteless. 7/10.",1203724800,,3347,4.907964601769912
2836414,5,B000QDLSR0,"I must admit, I didn't get into this show until Fall of 2007. I'm so glad I did. If you've been disillusioned by the same, boring dramas week after week on network television, this is the kind of show that will restore your faith in good television writing.

I could tell you about all the characters, plot twists and hidden nods to comic books in Heroes, but that's been covered by other reviewers, much better than I could ever write.

The question you're probably asking yourself is....what can this reviewer say to make ME decide to give Heroes a chance?

To set the stage, let's consider some of the movies that have come out about comic book characters: Batman, Daredevil, The Punisher, just to name a few.
The comic book movie that stands out, and the one which most people have seen, is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-Widescreen-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JKCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>.

But why?

It's because Spider-Man isn't a stereotypical hero from Krypton or born into extreme wealth who immediately wants to help other people...he's Peter Parker, a teenage kid from Queens, who never wanted the limelight and wanted to be like everybody else. However, fate decided that his great power also carried with it some great responsibilities - and that means he had to give up some things he really wanted to help others.

Spider-Man works because viewers can relate to a character who has human flaws and doesn't always make the right choices...the choice of selflessness, and thinking of others before oneself, is the surest sign of a hero.

Now let's swing back to the tv show.

In the case of Heroes, we are introduced to a special group of people across the globe that discover they are more than just ordinary....they are extraordinary. While some of them are excited about their abilities, some of them [like our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man], just want to shirk back into the doldrums and be the same as everyone else. Some of them are afraid of being different. Some of their powers honestly frighten them and they would give their left arm just to be 'normal' again. There is one person who gets intoxicated with their powers and wants nothing more than complete and total domination. It's up to our heroes, whether directly or indirectly, to stop him.

It would be easy to make a show that showcases special effects and pays no attention to character development; but this box set of Heroes takes us on a 23 episode arc which explores the motivations of every character, whether good or evil.

I think one of the greatest strengths of Heroes is the struggle of each 'special' person. In their own way, each character comes to their own understanding of what a hero really is....a person noted for feats of courage or nobility of purpose. Are they ready to accept their destiny? Or will they tuck tail and run the other way?

This entire first season plays out like a perfectly scripted comic book. Each episode ends with a cliffhanger, and will have you itching to put the next disc into the DVD player. The special features include deleted scenes, commentary audio tracks, interviews, and more. The box set also has the unaired 73-minute pilot episode...this offers us insights into some of the existing heroes and shows us one hero that was cut and then re-created into another character.

You don't have to have superpowers to be a hero.
And you don't have to read comic books to love this show.

2836419,4,B000QDLSR0,"Heroes shows that there is still room for new TV shows to get hooked on...
Combining the genetically provided superpowers of X-Men with the multi-season story arc ideas of Lost, this is terrifically written entertainment.  For the reality grounded segment of the audience, the fantasy is never played up too strongly, and the characters are written in with more detail than you might expect - thanks in part to a largely unknown cast that never have you doubting.  For the graphic novel inclined, there are numerous nods to Graphic novel conventions, and bright primary colors to enjoy.
As for the overall story arc, this scores over the likes of Lost by revealing the story a little faster, and having a satisfactory conclusion at the very end, albeit with a massive hook to keep you watching into the next series.  The story sags a little after the half way mark, but picks up again to finish on enough of a high to keep you watching.
While the idea might seem to have a kid -friendly ethos to it, be warned, some of the violence is quite extreme, and due to the superpowers they have, the characters do things you certainly would not want your kids emulating.  In this sense the target audience is hard to figure out, as the storylines are somewhat light compared to the slew of quality TV programs coming out of the US recently, while what happens to the characters, in particular their demise, is edging into the realm of horror.  Having said that, one of the attractions of the series is that it does have cross generational appeal - just bear in mind the PG-13 certificate is warranted.

2836420,2,B000QDLSR0,"This show isn't ""rich and layered"". It's not smart, or knowingly witty. Its characters are empty shells, puppets being strung around by the cliche-ridden plot.
It certainly knows its comic-book roots (how can it not, with names like Tim Kring and Jeff Loeb), but it's done with the widest possible audience in mind, and hence dumbed down to an unbelievable degree.
Granted, ""24"" isn't particularly intelligent in terms of its plots either. But ""24"" is mindless, edge of your seat entertainment that keeps you glued to the screen with its snappy politics, frenetic pace, and cliffhanger endings, not to mention a strong central character (go, Jack, go!) None of that is present in ""Heroes"". Nothing to make up for the shallow characterizations and stupid scripts. The pace is numbingly slow, and it's hard to care for the majority of the characters. Hiro is the only exception, actually, seeming genuinely surprised at the discovery of powers, unlike the others, who kind of take them for granted. Hiro has opinions and ideas, while others seem predetermined in what they have to do.
For example, Ali Larter is very one-dimensional, which is ironic, considering her character has split personality. Her face blank, she delivers lines of dialogue as if regurgitating them. All the scenes with her come to a screeching halt.
Same with Mohinder. My favorite line was something I read on EW.com: he is ""Mohindering the action"". That guy truly represents ""Heroes""' pointlessly talky progression (if one can call it that).
We have seen it all before: the end of the world coming, heroes uniting against the ultimate evil, blah blah blah... And it COULD have worked, if the characters weren't so utterly boring.
I encourage the fans of this show to please read Alan Moore's ""Watchmen"", or Neil Gaiman's ""Sandman"", or Frank Miller, Grant Morrison, Rick Veitch, Brian K. Vaughan, Bill Willingham... the list goes on, but pick any of those books or writers, and you will get a much more fulfilling experience than ""Heroes"" offers. They are truly 'adult' graphic novels, not struggling teeny glossy shows with bad special effects, a languid pace, forced twists and turns, and silly catchphrases, like that 'Save the Cheerleader' one...
I have to apologize - I realize I have been rambling in this review. But skimming through all the 5-star responses to the show, it just makes me sad. Is this as good as it can get, really? Are our expectations so low?  Then I give up hope in intelligent network television. Well, almost.

You have to see and watch each episode carefully, as you discover things towards the end to which there were hints in earlier episodes.

Without giving away too much, the basic concept is excellent - a bunch of people with extraordinary abilities discovering them in various situations, with characters with different abilities colliding at different points in the story.  Plus, the dark organisation that seems to have a vested interest in how events pan out, and a couple of evil ""heroes"" that threaten the existence of all others.  Everything leads up to a seemingly unavoidable cathartic event that involves all major characters, which influences each of their actions throughout the story.  Vague?  I apologise, trying not to turn this into a book report!

There are frustrations that leave you sometimes feeling the dramatic leap of faith the writers ask you to take are a little too dramatic.  This is the problem with stories that have that fantasy element surrounding ""real life"" characters. This doesn't get in the way of a good story telling, and like all good series, leaves the door open at the very end for a continuation next season (though, I hope this doesn't turn into a Lost-like scenario, where there's a heavy reliance on what becomes a ludicrous storyline).

I do thoroughly recommend the set though, as if you're anything like me you do want to see what happens in that next episode without having to wait a week.",1200268800,,1646,4.832740213523132

2836448,2,B000QDLSR0,"As others have commented, this comes with no alternate audio tracks (language or format) and only one alternate language subtitle (franais canadien). The picture looks like some of the worst film to DVD transfers I've ever seen. It's unbelievably grainy, and the MPEG-2 to VC-1 conversion just emphasizes the problem, like laminating something with dust trapped in it. I have to turn the brightness on my TV way down just to hide the noise, which sucks all the life out of the outdoor scenes, so I have a choice between looking drab and dull and just looking horrible. With such meager, low-quality data on the discs, I have a hard time imagining how they filled so many.

I have a suspicion that the people who actually think this and other HD DVD productions look good are using DLP or Plasma TVs. DLP TVs are darker and Plasma are less clear. If you have an LCD TV, avoid this like the plague. It looks terrible.

Also, the first time I put it in, my HD DVD player hard froze 14 seconds into the Universal logo, which is a big setback because the thing takes almost a minute just to turn on. (Toshiba HD-A20 -- also avoid like the plague.) I have no idea how much the disc is responsible for freezes, but it's another reason why I'm completely fed up with HD DVD and wish Universal would pull the plug on this format war. If this set were available on Blu-Ray, it could come in fewer discs with more audio data and higher bitrate video in its original MPEG-2 broadcast format. Cheap hardware and interactive features aren't worth anything when the main feature looks this bad.

I've already stopped buying Universal movies, including regular DVD, because of the exclusivity to the inferior format. I thought HD DVD was at least good enough to handle a TV show, but now I can't trust that, either.",1199318400,2,1799,4.563467492260062

2836454,5,B000QDLSR0,"A sensitive hospice nurse living in the shadow of his politician brother. An office drone dreaming of becoming a hero. A teenaged cheerleader just trying to fit in. An Internet stripper struggling to raise her gifted son. An L.A. cop whose marriage is collapsing. And an artist strung out on heroin. All characters whose lives have just become extraordinary.

NBC's HEROES engages in vicarious wish fulfillment and explores the fascinating nature of super powers and what it would be like to be gifted with amazing abilities. No surprise then that HEROES, premiering on September 25, 2006, quickly became one of the hottest new shows of 2006. While this show's big hook hinges on the superhero theme, HEROES doesn't come all heavy with the gaudy special effects. There are no costumes, no superhero code names (unless you count ""Flying Man!"" as a code name). Instead, HEROES focuses on down-to-earth storylines which ground the cast and the fantasy elements. The everyday settings and situations keep it all relatable. To pique interest, the episodes do end on a cliffhanger, and, on occasion, the show actually doles out answers to several of the ongoing mysteries.

This is a humongous cast, and each actor steps up. Plenty of compelling characters here, but the breakouts seem to be: Hiro Nakamura, the sweetly nerdy and infectiously enthusiastic Japanese office drone, played by the cherubic Masi Oka; Claire Bennet (Hayden Panettiere), the invincible high school cheerleader; and the sexy, tortured Niki Sanders (Ali Larter, oh so sensuous). But also effective are Adrian Pasdar as the unflappable and coldly ambitious Nathan Petrelli and James Kyson Lee as Ando, Hiro's sidekick. One of the best things about the show is Lee and Oka's fun chemistry. As well, in Lee, the show provides us with a rootable point-of-view character. With the core roster being so large and varied, there are multiple story threads. But, man, do you get hooked with each one! The overriding story arc, involving an impending apocalypse in New York, manages to tie in all these subplots.

Every show like this needs a good villain, and we are introduced to several candidates. Zachary Quinto (who does look like Spock) is the very scary boogeyman Sylar, a superpowered serial killer who hunts other gifted individuals and murders them to steal their talents. There's the mysterious Mr. Linderman, who seems to have his finger in every pie. My favorite bad guy, though, may be H.R.G. (Horn-Rimmed Glasses, aka Claire's dad), who, as the season progresses, develops into a fascinating, multi-layered character.

So many things to like about HEROES. There's the obvious stuff, with the fan boy's dream of a premise. Then the well-rounded characters with whom you empathize, and their incredible powers. The writing, dabbling in the fantastic but rooted in reality, consistently sucks you in. Each episode forms a chapter in one encompassing narrative (so you can't really afford to miss one). The show drips with human drama, edge-of-your-couch suspense, stupendous action (when it crops up), and an overhanging sense of dread, of Armageddon being only one misstep away. It certainly engages in moral dilemmas, or, put another way: ""Is Peter Parker cheating when he sells photos of Spider-Man?"" Needless to say, the twists and turns, the shocks and revelations, when they surface, will stun you.

HEROES creates an intricate internal mythology, all credit to series creator Tim Kring and his co-horts for some well-conceived world-building. And, as mentioned, HEROES doesn't go overboard with the f/x, but when the show does indulge in f/x, it does so with ridiculous flair. In particular, the stupendous injuries which Claire sustains are of the queasy variety. In particular, one character's power of prophesy adds a darker, even more dramatic dimension to the show, giving rise to the question: Is the future mutable? Props also to comic book artist Tim Sale, whose contributions cannot be overlooked.

Finally, the high muck-a-mucks actually come thru with the special features, of which there's a walloping plentitude. To start with, HEROES - SEASON 1 offers cast and crew audio commentary on 13 episodes. This includes Tim Kring's thoughts on the unedited, semi-alternative version of the pilot ""Genesis,"" which offers up a deleted terrorism story arc. My favorite commentary, though, is on the awesome dystopian episode ""Five Years Later."" Amazingly, there are 50 deleted scenes. There's the 10-minute-long ""Making Of"" featurette, as well as segments on the show's stunts, special effects, and musical score. An interesting profile of color blind comic book artist Tim Sale (who rendered Isaac Mendez's paintings). And you can even play the freaky-cool ""Mind Reader"" game.

Got nothing more to add, really. If you haven't yet, watch the dang show and get set to have your bump of curiousity nudged mightily. Oh, and pay the writers already, so Season 2 gets back from limbo.",1198886400,3,4961,5.19375

2836462,5,B000QDLSR0,"Are you an evolutionist or a creationist? Or maybe, like myself, you are a little of both?

Evolution versus creationism is a hotly debated issue nowadays, and it has reached the floors of the US congress. Should schools teach evolution, or should they rather teach creationism?

Are we really the descendants of apes? If so, are human beings still evolving? The evolution from ape to man was a big leap. Will such a big leap happen again? And if so, will we have powers that will make humans of the 21st century appear like apes to humans in future centuries? Will we be able to have powers like those portrayed in the TV series `Heroes'?

I really love this series, and it might not be as farfetched as you think. I really think we are still evolving, becoming better and better at almost everything, and harnessing new powers that we take for granted today. For example, why didn't we invent electricity a few thousand years ago? Were we incapable of this feat because our brains were not yet evolved for such a feat? Why did we technologically progress more in the last 200 years than we did since man first walked on Earth? Is it because we have been biologically evolving? If so, what will we become in thousands of years from now? Will we even notice the change, or will it come around so gradual, spanning thousands of years, that we will hardly notice any change at all?

From ape to human being; from human being to...?

I do believe we have so much power within ourselves, but we still are not trusted with the keys to opening this power. Evolution will gradually give us the keys, but one step at a time.

This series is about people discovering powers within themselves that make them super humans.  Some can fly; stop time; travel through time; read thoughts; heal quickly; become invisible; walk through walls etc... Their lives eventually become intertwined together in a fascinating storyline. This is both an action packed thriller and a sci-fi.

As season 2 kicks in seacons 1 is now available on DVD and it's FANTASTIC. Action packed, amazing special effects, but most of all mind-blowing story lines that'll get you hooked after just one episode (my friends will second that). ALL the characters are brilliant and I must say, ALL rather good looking too, which is always nice.

I'm not going to go into all the stories of this season because if you're considering purchasing this box set you probably know the story already, but just a heads up - It's packed with loads of deleted scenes, the initial pilot episode, cast and director interviews as well as ALL the unmissible episodes first aired on NBC/Sky and then Channel 2 in the UK.

If you're a Heroes fan BUY THIS, if you're not a Heroes fan BUY THIS and you'll never regret it.

One last thing: I got this version of the DVD (American version) because it was out MONTHS before the UK release. They are EXACTLY the same aside from the packaging, but I actually prefer this version. It has a hologramed slip case cover and then the inner container folds out to reveil the actual Discs. The UK version is just your simple slip cover and the DVDs are individually cased - great if you're careless with your discs, but not as tidy looking as the US version.

2836468,2,B000QDLSR0,"Everybody absolutely loves Heroes. Both the DVD and HD-DVD versions have near perfect reviews.

I feel very differently. I think the plot is sophisticated. It pulls you in. Once you see the first episode you want to see what happens next. It's a continuing series like a soap-opera. I bought Season one on hd-dvd. The video quality is generally cleaner than dvd but no where near the quality of planet earth. I have dvds that are cleaner than heroes.

What I've seen so far of Heroes is a far cry from X-Men and other super heroes. Heroes is in some ways based on x-men. People discovering they are gifted and some do good while others do bad and yet there is one person bent on killing everyone who is gifted. X-Men does this well. With heroes it's so different It's so violent, so filled with blood and gore. Heroes almost celebrates detestable things. It feels so satanic and evil. Appearing to give you thrills and suspense and super heroes while really pushing death. SO MUCH DEATH. So much death and we get to see all the gore associated with most of the deaths. I believe there is no positive substance to be found here like saving lives and humanity in a genuine way. I believe the writer or writers of heroes has a fixation with death and murder and has written an elaborate script to pull people in thinking the are seeing gifted people do great things while really feeding them dead people.

2836470,5,B000QDLSR0,"Heroes is (objectively speaking, of course) one of the best TV shows in existence. The characters are human, complicated, and real (though their powers may not be). The plots are complex as well, and each character is intriguing. There are little things that you notice the second time watching that you don't notice the first.

There seems to be basically one story arc for each season. The show does have some common TV-show flaws: it is predictable at times, and certain things happen that shouldn't (and certain things don't happen that should), just to keep the story going. For example, Peter, who absorbs anyone's powers, does not absorb Eden's power of persuasion, even though he is in the same room with her for a while. Pretty much the only show that does not seem to have either of those flaws is Joss Whedon's Firefly.

I highly recommend Heroes to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or fantasy that involves interesting powers.

One final note: Heroes is often criticised as a rip-off of X-Men. Those who compare Heroes to X-Men are missing several very important points, a few of which I will mention here:

1. Nobody wears costumes.

2. Only one person - Sylar - has a nickname in Heroes, as opposed to Rogue, Professor X, Cyclops, etc. in X-Men.

3. Not everybody is either trying to save the world, or destroy it. Some are just trying to get by.

4. Though the characters' paths cross frequently, they are not all part of an organisation or group. They have their separate lives.",1197504000,,1486,4.714285714285714

2836472,5,B000QDLSR0,"I do not think you really mean what you said when you wrote that the show is only for simple minded people.  You're only looking at the show on a very superficial level.  If any other person wants to watch this show, then you should also do some self reflection upon yourself as you are watching the episodes and the story arcs.

The show deals with many morals that affects all of us but we don't really talk about anymore.  It also casts a ""new"" light on super heroes (""new"" because an attempt was made in the 80's with a graphic novel titled ""Watchmen"" but nobody really remembers it now) .  The general paradigm of a superhero is probably one that is very much like superman: omnipotent and almost omniscient.

In heroes, we are forced to re-think the image of a hero: we always think that the superhero has the highest morals and always does the right thing.  In Heroes, we see that the basic element that connects all heroes (human or alien) is that they have human emotions that often blur their decision making and can make the strongest heroes fall due to the hard grip of emotions.

There are also many other things that one can talk about with regards to this show including personal identity, ethics & morality (especially utilitarianism, Kantianism, and moral duty), existentialism, and even metaphysics.

The greeks and other great writers created fictitious stories not only to just ""pass the time"" but we really learn a lot about ourselves when we study other people; especially if those other people are very different from ourselves.",1197072000,,1551,4.714814814814815
2836473,5,B000QDLSR0,"As a comic book fan, and a film lover it is great to get to see the two mediums combined every week! I am from the u.k and I loved this series, although the plot went slightly skew in the middle quarter the momentum that built toward the climax was superb even if the ending was only an eight out of ten. Ali Larter is superb, and I found her and sylar  to be the best characters on the show. But to be honest I loved everybody aprt from..... Hiro! Yes I sound evil but I didn't like his character at all. He was comic relief at first but then he seemed to irritate me a lot. I hope they up the ante for this show in season two, although I think Sylar should have died I think keeping him alive speaks of a lack of creative ideas for season two. Lets have a fresh baddy with the bogey man that is mentioned toward the end of this season. I loved Heroes because it was dark and showed that comic book kids that were called geeks at school (well I was!) now dominate the world of enetertainment, is also nice to see Tim Sale's art on screen and Jeph Loeb's writing skills out there for all to watch.

2836479,5,B000QDLSR0,"The nicely produced series Heroes proves in its first season that its creator, Tim Kring, understands the desires of many of us to overcome tremendous obstacles and to go back and change the past so as to affect the future more positively.  To this end, he has created a large number of characters in a fine ensemble cast who possess extraordinary abilities.  We follow them on their journey to find out more about themselves as well as their place in the saga.
  It is telling that season one ends with the brothers Petrelli sacrificing themselves rather than destroying part of NYC, which would have ushered in a police state and fascism, with Peter Petrelli as president and his devious mother working behind the scenes to create a new world order.  The echoes of the post 9/11 world are unmistakable.
  Be forewarned that although this is almost in a comic book format visually, it is not for kids.  Many scenes are violent and bloody; this is for the mature viewers only.",1196467200,,976,4.7

I have pretty much given up on anything being truly entertaining on network television but Heroes is a delightful bit of escapist fun.  For those ""geeks"" out there, the allusions are well timed, amusing, and just obscure enough that most viewers won't get it.  The casting is brilliant and, again, a few nods of inside jokes there as well.  Yes, there is a derivative quality to some of it a la X-Men and Highlander but who cares when it is so very well done?  Usually I can anticipate plot turns and developments.  This show left me very pleasantly surprised and wrapped up so many plot threads that I was sure the final dvd would leave them all dangling.  I look forward to borrowing season 2 when it is made available on dvd!

They are supposed to be Heros!  So why are they sleeping with married men, cheating on their boyfriends, taking drugs, and possibly killing in revenge ?(I didn't watch far enough to see if the cheerleader really killed off the fellow who tried to rape her.) Cheating is implied to be OK, heroin has its uses, and it's OK and kinda cool to watch videos of stripping women.

2836489,4,B000QDLSR0,"This was a satisfying series, fun to watch, with enough twists and turns to keep you interested.  It's appealing in the same way as a comic book, but with more complicated plots and characters. Thankfully, it isn't one of those programs that takes itself so seriously, you have to wade through an hour of political and social sermons to get to the story. We'll see if the second season is also free of politics.  Almost too much to hope for.  If you are like us, and unable to regularly catch a network television series, this is a great investment in a few pleasant evenings. If you like this, buy the Lost series next.

Although there are those in the show that one could label ""Good"" or ""Bad"", there are also those who are more in the ""Shades of Grey"" area and will have you flipping back and forth between rooting for them and booing them. The way the writers made the story so that each of the character's lives are intertwined, especially since the characters don't even realize it until some time has past, is excellent and will keep you guessing as to what the reality of the situation is.

I completely recommend this show to anyone.",1194566400,,656,4.559322033898305

2836505,5,B000QDLSR0,"When you've got Jeph Loeb (one of the comic book industry's most prolific writers) on board, it's easy to love his work.  While working for DC Comics, he did consulting work on ""Smallville,"" which is the WB/CW's most successful show.

If Heroes has a problem, it might be in the set-up.  There are so many characters, that the first seven-eight episodes are mostly spent in getting you acquainted with them, their situations, their powers, and how they will utlimately come into play down the road.  Trust me.  Hang in there!  Once the plot really gets moving, you will find yourself watching one episode after the other.  I do know a few people who stopped watching the show stating, ""it never got going and I got tired of waiting.""  After I told them that things definitely got very interesting and fun, they regretted having stopped watching the show and are even now trying to catch up with this DVD set.  Also, the show might be a bit too violent for young kids.

Heroes might be called a ""comic book"" style show that is grounded in realism.  It's actually very difficult to bridge the gap between the comic book world and our world, but this show does this very well.  There are no masks or spandex costumes at work.  In fact, much of the basis for these people having special abilities is grounded in genetic science.  Anyone who is a reader of the ""X-Men"" might find some interesting parallels.

The cast is very good, but the strength of the show truly lies in the writing.  The small stories that eventually flow into the major plot are handled with style and grace.  If you feel that you're in the dark regarding certain plot elements, it is because you are supposed to be!  In many ways, you're not supposed to be able to predict what is coming next.

Each ""hero"" has a multitude of obstacles in their path, whether it is family situations, fitting in with a crowd, trying to please a demanding father, or simply trying to do what is necessary, we find that these heroes aren't able to easily solve their problems.  In many ways, their new-found powers create more problems, and they have to learn how to use their abilities to adapt.

The heroes are also gifted with one special ability, (not counting Peter Petrelli who can absorb the powers of others or Sylar who steals them) so you won't see someone flying and demonstrating super strength at the same time.

Just like the X-Men, you have a government group who is trying desperately to track down these heroes and either 1) stop them from using their abilities, or 2) use them for their own purposes.  So, what happens when your father is a member of this covert agency?  This is one plot element that is addressed here.

The cast is fantastic, and the special effects are great.  But what makes this show so successful is that it always focuses on the characters and not their abilities.  Most writers and directors make the mistake of focusing on the abilities, which ultimately make boring and uninteresting characters.

There are some great guest stars on this show from George Takei (Star Trek's Sulu) to Malcolm McDowell (one of the screen's best villain actors).

The show is great fun, and if you hang in there through the long set-up, I truly think you will enjoy this show.  Even the successful Batman and Superman films had half the movie used for origin and set-up issues.  Granted, this is a bit longer in 7-8 episodes, but it is really worth it!",1194048000,,3427,4.614876033057851

2836512,3,B000QDLSR0,"I just bought the DVD from Walmart after my brother highly recommended it.  Frankly, the opening to the series is pretty boring...a lofty question about ""why are we here?""  As much as I love philosophizing over those things, drama is visual and demands action.  The pilot should have begun with the scene of the Japanese guy squeezing his eyes shut and stopping the second hand of his clock.  What a dramatic beginning that makes you want to know more that's going on.  Instead the show begins with two guys in India jabbering on about some dramatic work someone's father did that needed to be finished.  Shows should excite you in a way which make you want to put in the next DVD to see what happens next.  You should be grabbed from the beginning.  It shouldn't just make you wait to see what happens next.  After some point, people stop waiting.

I contrast this with Smallville's pilot.  It had a very, very dramatic beginnig.  The town of Smallville is hit by a meteor shower from Clark's spaceship arriving to Earth which frightens everyone.  That very premise made for a strong and creative series the whole way through the show.  The show, without a doubt, has excellent writers.

Heroes is probably one of those storylines that has to unravel versus having you leaning on the edge of your seat.  I'll be patient with it since it's become so popular.  Although, if I were a producer and saw the pilot for this, I would have canned it.",1193616000,,1442,4.592156862745098

DVD did not work, sent back received second copy this also didn't work. Had a great deal of trouble trying to receive a refund on the item due to inconsistent feedback from customer service advisors who didn't appear to be aware of their own company's policies.

Shocking service and will not be ordering from amazon again.",1193270400,2,456,4.6875
2836515,5,B000QDLSR0,"This is one of the most ambitious shows I have ever watched, with complex and fascinating story lines and an almost perfect execution. When I heard the name of this series, the first thing that came to mind, was the heroes of the Marvel comics. However, this show is much more along the lines of ""Smallville"", presenting people with superpowers, but who dress and act normal in most aspects of life, trying to blend in with others.

The show has a considerable amount of people whose genes have evolved and therefore have special abilities. Examples includes a politician who can fly, a cheerleader who cannot get hurt, an artist who can paint the future, and a Japanese office worker who can bend time, among many others. Through the show, we get to see how the stories of these different people are interconnected. This is not all though. There are other things added to the mix: a special guy that can capture other people's abilities, a researcher who is looking for answers regarding the heroes and the death of his father, and a company that is aware of the existence of these special people and does not plan to stay aside and watch. Oh, and if that was not enough, there is the nuclear explosion that threatens to destroy the city of New York in a few weeks.

Even though the first couple of episodes are a little slow and it takes a little while to grasp the idea exposed though all the different stories, by episode three I was hooked. The rest of the series went by at warp speed and I never lost interest. Besides the enthralling story lines, the suspense and the fast-paced action, one of the things I enjoyed most about the show was witnessing the process by which the heroes discover and master their special abilities, especially in the case of Peter. In the first episode, Peter thinks he can fly, like his brother Nathan, but it is only after a while that he truly understands what he can achieve.
The quantum leaps in time provide another mesmerizing element to the story, end even though this presents a great challenge to the creators, they manage to avoid most of the major pitfalls. There are some minor problems with some of the logic, but these are minor mistakes, especially considering the complexity of the plot. In terms of the actors, we get good performances from most, and really excellent ones from Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli), Hayden Panettiere (Claire the cheerleader) and Masi Oka (Hiro Nakamura). In the first few episodes, the performance of Ali Larter, as Niki / Jennifer, seems stiff and exaggerated, but once she gets the hang of it, things improve dramatically.

People that get upset by non-linear stories should probably stay away from this series, but if complexity does not bother you, there are not many shows as interesting as this one. If the seasons to come are as good as this first season, I will be entertained for a while.",1193270400,,2882,4.680473372781065

2836518,2,B000QDLSR0,"I didn't watch all the episodes in this first season of Heroes, primarily because of the lack of resolution in the plot lines. I prefer shows like Closer, Bones, Firefly, or Dexter, where each episode solves a situation or closes a case, and the continuing plot lines have to do with the character's relationships and personal situations. Heroes does have some charming and intriguing characters (Hiro and Ando, Suresh, Matt the policeman, the cheerleader's father, the politician's brother), but on the whole, I felt like the writers/producers were teasing us, jerking us around like puppets for the sake of inducing an emotional reaction, rather than simply telling us good stories about exceptional people.",1193184000,2,709,5.283185840707965

I collect a lot of series on DVD and most of the time these productions are only made to bring in fast money. None or little extras, no heart just quick 'n' dirty.
Heroes is different. The whole thing shows the love of the producers all over it. Nice looks, great menus and, to top it all, a trillion of extras!
Almost every episode has deleted scenes, most of them have a commentary track and lots of other things that really make these DVDs a MUST to buy.

Compare this production to Star Trek (and I love ST). ST when it first came out on DVD had no extras, poor quality and you had to pay twice as much as you have to pay for heroes.

2836537,5,B000QDLSR0,"Tim Kring's ""Heroes"" hit TV not too long ago and left audiences utterly stunned. Furthermore it left TV critics banging their heads against the wall. This is NOT the typical ""superhero"" story.

Now when Heroes first hit TV airwaves I was pretty apathetic.
Why?
Because I hate ""superheroes"".

On an alternate note Heroes details several seemingly normal people who come to each realize they have a unique ability to themselves. From there the very seemingly unconnected lives of all these people become very intertwined as things progress. The series grows exponentially with every episode, all leading up to an uncertain future. Will they make it in time to stop the big event in the season finale? Will they not? What are the consequences of both roads? Which is the lesser of two evils? Coke or Pepsi? Each one of them has to follow their own road and decide for themselves what to do. At the same time they must all face the demons of their pasts (some more than others), and some must deal with their demons in the present. (Confusing as that may sound it makes sense when you watch it.)

This series is top notch! Don't let my little rant fool you. The first season of this epic series leaves nothing to the imagination and keeps coming until the final climactic end...or does it? *Dun-dun-dunnn*

This is not a series for
A.) The faint of heart.
B.) The faint of mind.
C.) People expecting masks, tights, or wearing your underwear on the outside.

2836539,2,B000QDLSR0,"I really wanted to like Heroes.  Let me repeat that, I REALLY wanted to like Heroes.  A number of people who I work with claimed it was a fantastic show and that he had a number of similarities to another show I am a big fan of,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B000P6YNSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>.  The original plan (which the creators clearly abandoned) was to make this a one season show.  22 episodes and then call it a day.  This seemed like an excellent premise since one season would give them time to create an interesting story arc, but would avoid the risk of going&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Files/dp/B000UZDO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Files</a>&nbsp;on me and dragging on into irrelevance.

So I sat down and watched the first episode all excited to get deeply involved in another serial show.  My first reaction was that the show seemed very low rent.  The scenes in New York and India felt like they were shot on a back-lot and the characters came off as very two dimensional.

Part of the challenge may been trying to do too much.  Heroes had something like 15 main characters (I'm defining this as being in more than 2/3 of the episodes) and didn't use anything like the flashbacks from Lost to help define them.  The was compounded by the fact that they had many different threads.  While they all came together in the end, it jumped around way too much in the beginning to be cohesive.  All of this made it seem like a low-rent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B000HEVZ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>&nbsp;rip-off.  Big on stolen ideas, low on execution

After 10 or so episodes I found myself completely uninterested in what was going to happen, but pledged to soldier on since it was a one year ""hit it and quit it"" series.  So the 11th hour abdication of this promise with what has to be one of the worst cliff-hangers I can think of in television history added insult to injury.  My prediction is that by the end of season 2 this show will be well on its way to being another X-files and probably won't see a fourth season.",1192579200,17,2221,5.336206896551724

2836542,2,B000QDLSR0,"So, I rented the DVDs because everyone told me this show was ""awlsome"" (sic). What I found, to my chagrin, was a superficial, trite blend of superhero mythologies, a mix of elements from the Marvel Universe (mostly X-Men, Hulk, and Spider Man plot elements). Of course, any show with a comic book conceit can claim exemption from depth, but you sense this one is trying, but failing. Some of the acting is passable, although many of the attempted foreign accents are not. There's an American playing an Indian scholar with an atrocious British accent (odd, given his pedigree with the Royal Shakespeare Company) a main character's wife with Australian inflections on her American accent (why this recent trend?), and several instances of overacting, save for the mind reading character. But the problem is really that the show strives for a kind of tragic pathos, but misses. Also, having powers is supposed to be the rarest of gifts, but every other person our heroes happen upon seems to also have mysterious powers. Hmmm. There are too many characters and subplots to give the show any real depth. If the show has any tragic pathos, it's that it's almost enjoyable, but not quite.",1192579200,8,1183,4.890547263681592

It's an in-depth approach to ""X-Men"" - the struggles with how they discover their new powers, the frustration and confusion.  Each episode includes some suspence, some action, some drama...in a nutshell: a little bit of everything.  Underscoring this is great cinematography, graphics, storyline, acting and music.

The most important thing about serial TV shows is the approach: take it one episode at a time.  Let the ""how-can-I-wait-until-the-next-episode"" sink in for a while before you just plunge into the next episode.  Take your time watching the show.

From wikipedia I've gathered that the show is planned for a 5-year run, covering specific events.  So don't worry, this is not an Alias that will keep on going until the ratings drop and then they cancel it, this show has a plan.  And I bet, after 5 years we'll probably be begging for more.

Recommended for:  X-men lovers, Superheroes, X-Files fans - and anyone up for something new and exciting.

The story itself is great, well acted and well written. The effects are good, and use of filming on location seems evident.

My main complaint is that the beginning of the season moves a little slowly, a flaw they seem to be repeating with the second season. However, in the first season background is necessary to understand the characters, so it can be forgiven.

Overall it's a great show, and the only one I'm watching currently. TV seemingly lost it's appeal and then heroes came and caught me from the first episode.",1192579200,2,752,4.681818181818182

Well worth it, a cracking show that mixes soap opera with sci-fi conventions in a truly pleasing way. It's also a damn site more satisfying to watch shows in a box set, where you're not waiting a week for the next episode.

Also, with the current dollar/ pound sterling exchange rate, it was an absolute bargain (half of season one was recently released in the UK and it was still more expensive than the full US version).",1192492800,,545,4.3431372549019605
2836547,4,B000QDLSR0,"Funny how the business has changed through the years. In the beginning... it was all about the movies (Chaplin, Keaton, Flynn etc.)... and then THE HONEYMOONERS and I LOVE LUCY... and then, for actors, being on a television show was taboo and low level career move... and then, over the last few years, the roles have reversed again.... with shows like Buffy, E.R., X-Files, Smallville, 24 and now HEROES. Production values and entertainment values have gone through the roof, showing us why staying at home, or more importantly, buying these season DVD sets the hottest thing since the tv dinner.

With HEROES, and not unlike, the other shows I mentioned, with television series', adequate time is spent experiencing the characters lives and getting to know them. You become invested in them. You grieve when they grive. You laugh when they laugh. You mourn when they die. You become engrossed like no 90 to 120 minute movie can do. You can't keep from hitting the play another episode button... despite the hours you've already spent on your couch.

Heroes is the ULTIMATE in bringing the effects of the cineplex to the television set. Not to mention, you get into the characters more than you ever will with Spiderman 1,2 or 3... or any Batman movie...

The production value is through the roof. Great effects. Great transistions from plot point to plot point. The beauty of HEROES is that it's never dull and never formulaic. Unlike some shows that have a theme and every week there's a new dilemma to correct in 43 minutes, HEROES entertwines numerous dilemma's, blends them, hooks them, shatters them and brings it all into perspective as the season unfolds.

HEROES is what entertainment is all about. At times frightening. At times funny. At times sad and always interesting.

My only gripe comes with a disappointing finale, and the reason why I gave just 4 stars instead of 5. So much build up. So much expectation, and it seemed all crammed into 40 minutes and... well... hokey... and there were too many... well why didn't she do this, or why didn't he do that?

But Heroes is something new even for Kring. He has jumped, nay, dashed, headlong into the fantasy realm.

There are some common themes running through Heroes that make it a four star rating rather than five. Dark and conflicted superheroes are well-known to comic book and graphic novel fans.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SPIDER-MAN/dp/B00005JPFH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SPIDER-MAN</a>&nbsp;had to battle his own dark side, as did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SUPERMAN/dp/B000J10KTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SUPERMAN</a>&nbsp;and many others.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-HULK/dp/B00005JKC3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE HULK</a>&nbsp;is just a pi$$ed-off green guy who has to learn to control his anger and is aided by love. Such are several themes within Heroes (for instance the Niki/Jessica character's love for her son Micah; and Nathan Petrelli's battle with the good and evil that surrounds him). From this standpoint, there's not a lot of fresh meat on its bones.

Where it succeeds (and overwhelmingly so) is in its characters. They are particularly well cast with each person ""living"" that fictional person's life. Claire Bennett (played by Hayden Panettiere,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-DUST-FACTORY/dp/B0007GP6ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE DUST FACTORY</a>) is a wonderful person that all audience members must cheer for. She's a cheerleader who can regenerate her damaged body. Fire. Radiation. Falls from fifty story buildings. Nothing can permanently injure her (or can it?).

Nathan Petrelli (played by Adrian Pasdar) is the penultimate politician, trying to win his congressional district while at the same time attempting to hide his special ability. He can fly and his brother Peter believes he can too. Nathan tries in vain to talk Peter out of discovering his super abilities, but more surprises await Peter than could ever be imagined.

Niki Sanders (played by Ali Larter) has something terrible inside her. She battles with this ""evil"" twin while at the same time trying to protect her equally gifted son Micah (Noah Gray-Cabey,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LADY-IN-THE-WATER/dp/B000JLTR8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LADY IN THE WATER</a>).

Isaac Mendez (played by Santiago Cabrera) is a junky artist who can paint the future. And when he paints the obliteration of New York City, he soon finds himself the interest of a unique company of people designed to find these gifted men and women.

Any series wouldn't be complete without a villain, and Sylar (Zachary Quinto,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B00005JLF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>) is definitely that. Initially just a simple watchmaker/repairman, Sylar finds that he can steal the powers of the gifted and use it as his own ...but only after dissecting their brains.

This review definitely wouldn't be complete without mentioning the wheels that keep this thing turning, and that is Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BALLS-OF-FURY/dp/B00005JPEV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BALLS OF FURY</a>). He and his sidekick Ando (James Kyson Lee) infuse almost all of the much needed comic relief into the series. One of my favorite banters between them was, Hiro: ""My only concern is should I hide my true identity? A costume maybe?"" Ando: ""You start talking about capes and tights and I'm out of here.""

A truly fun series to watch, and something for everyone, even those that don't like comic books, superheroes, or fantasy.",1191888000,2,4252,6.832103321033211
2836572,5,B000QDLSR0,"All I can say is that the HD-DVD version of Heroes is fantastic.  Obviously, I love the storyline, but the crisp HD picture throughout the series and the various extras including deleted scenes and other perks such as being able to easily find all the places the hidden broken helix is definitely puts this at the top of my collection.

2836575,4,B000QDLSR0,"""Heroes"" was THE freshest television experience of the 2006 fall schedule.  The ""heroes"" mentioned in the title are people who develop powers through a change in their genetic code, even manifesting itself in some way from parent to child.  While this phenomenon isn't really named in ""Heroes"", the powers reveal themselves in things like extremely fast regeneration, human flight, time travel, etc.  I think I would consider it more of a drama than science fiction because the dramatic elements drive the story and plot.  The powers of the characters just add that additional wow factor.

Season 1 does much to introduce the viewer to the myriad collection of heroes.  It shows how a few of the characters are just freshly developing their powers while others have known about their powers for a while but don't yet understand their individual importance to the big picture.  Partway through the season, the show took a very ""X-Men:  Days of Future Past"" feel with Hiro traveling to a rather bleak future New York.  The introduction of dark, brooding Sylar as the first super villain to the franchise interjects some negative balance to the overwhelming number of ""good guys"".  This provides a turning point as our heroes start to run into each other with more purpose and guide the story towards its season 1 conclusion.

Heroes is an excellent show with huge growth potential, but this is not to say that ""Heroes"" is not without fault.  The show occasionally loses focus because there are so many characters with different powers.  While these powers are incredible, it's hard to see how interesting it is within the plot.  Though it attempts to weave the characters across each others' paths, it sometimes feels too forced.  What are the odds of two of our heroes meeting each other in a random diner out in the desert?  Awfully seredipitous.  Also, I personally found the story line of Niki pretty uninteresting and almost irrelevant.  Even though I appreciate the dramatic elements, the inner nerd thinks the show's use of all the powers seems a little stingy.  I wanted to see more of Nathan's flying and even Sylar's powers rather than Claire mangling herself (We get it!  She can heal!) and Niki blacking out and waking up in a room with body parts everywhere.  In the end, these make for rather small complaints.

In conclusion, the first season of ""Heroes"" lays the groundwork while also hinting at great potential.  There are inklings of a previous generation of heroes, questions of The Company, the future, Sylar and how he.. harvests powers, Peter's full potential.  It can all seem overwhelming, but it's also what makes every episode a must-see.",1191715200,,2662,4.930337078651686

Surprisingly, I just fell in love with the exciting plot line and intriguing characters in the series!
Yes, some parts of it were too grotesque for me to watch (like Sylar mercilessly cutting open his victims' heads), but I was mesmerized by the thrilling events and interesting characters involved in them.

I'd watched the first 11 episodes on TV here in the UK and could not wait to find out the conclusion to the first season. I ordered the boxset from USA and was not disapointed at all. With loads of extras including a 73 minute unaired version of the pilot episode and 23 regular episodes, this boxset was a bargain at $39.99. I know full well that when its released here in the UK, we will be expected to pay double that!!!!!

HEROES is a wonderfully produced series which follows the lives of these people as they learn and cope with their super-abilities, as well as find the path that leads them together to save the world. The casting is suberb and the writing, editing and directing are well-above par in this serial drama. The DVD includes an un-aired pilot with Tim Kring's original cut of the show. Although most of the scenes are the same as what was broadcast in the fall of 2006, you can appreciate the creativity of the additional scenes and notice that the final story and cast changes were made for the better of the show. Including deleted scenes for almost every episode was a smart addition to the DVDs as it gives the already millions of fans additional footage they did not see at the time of broadcast or later on thier DVRs. The episode commentary is educational, informative and hilarious.

2836596,4,B000QDLSR0,"It's always amusing to watch a new sci-fi or fantasy series commence, trying to explain how their 'heroes' arrived at their newly found status. In a way, this makes Heroes novel, with a huge part of this first series being all about this journey. Normally producers of such series drag this out over an extended period of time, feeding the audience titbits in the hope of keeping the audience captivated through titilation. It is this voyeuristic approach to the past which makes Heroes (and for that matter, Lost and similar) the success it has been. However I felt that sometimes the scriptwriters ran out of ideas and shortchanged the audience by making the 'Bobby Ewing gets out of the shower' leaps of faith, which stretched the incredulity, and distorted the story. I'm going to be honest, I am only halfway through this first series at the moment, so I will rereview this upon viewing completion.",1191369600,2,903,4.832258064516129

2836624,4,B000QDLSR0,"These stories are an event in your life.  Sometimes, it feels like they can maybe even save you.  HEROES is not one of these stories.  (At least, not yet.) The actors are generally good (many of them have played wonderful supporting roles in other hit shows).  The comics style for the X-men-esque genre is fresh.  The super powers are fun.  The villain is most definitely evil - he's black without hints of gray.  And our heroes have a glimpse of a future that they want to alter - a prophecy that ""destiny"" has given them a chance to change.  It is a recipe for a hit show, maybe even a great show.  BUT, it hasn't yet found a way into our hearts.  Does anybody actually CARE about these characters (barring sweet, sweet Hiro)?  I find that I wouldn't cry for them.  Or cheer for them.  Or sit on the edge of my seat and hope for them.  I do hope that this will change as the show grows - there were a few moments there in this season where I felt like the show could really be great.  Definitely keep this show on your radar!

(I have to say that I admire the writers for tackling a show like this.  It seems to me that one of the dangers of a show where everyone has super powers is that once the audience has opened up their imaginations, they start to wonder things like, ""well, if he can fly, why doesn't he just do it?""  It's hard not to overthink the plots, and hard for us to believe that anyone with super powers and super friends might actually be in danger.  Good luck, show writers!)",1190937600,4,1497,4.207746478873239

2836629,5,B000QDLSR0,"Initially I dismissed this series until a friend of mine convinced me to que it on Netflix, after watching the first disk I knew I had to have the entire series.  It is written with all the intertwined drama of a comic book, and while that may make it seem like it's predictible, its far from it.  Heroes acheives a rare success with even the villian of the series, he is clearly the bad guy but in a compelling manner, one is interested in seeing what Sylar plans next and how he thinks.  From the way Heroes get their origins in this series, one can clearly see the influence of Marvel Comics and the Mutant theme, for that's basically what the ""exceptional among  us"" are, but its done in a fashion to where it absorbs you into its premise, even guiding you to anticipate who has the genetic enhancement and who doesn't, making for some great surprises (and pleasure in correctly guessing connections).

The way the stories unfold and the quality acting that propels the series truly do make for a runaway hit, it may seem slow at first, but hang with it, you won't regret it if you're even a slight fan of the genre.",1190937600,2,1120,4.41747572815534
2836630,2,B000QDLSR0,"Heroes.  A simple, already-thought-of idea made into a TV show.  In it's own right, that's brilliant!  However Heroes is a show where not much happens, except lots of mediocre acting, pretty bad writing and the ocasional special effect here and there.

With a story that involves people with ""super powers"", it's almost irresistable NOT to want to watch it every week.  Fortunately for the creators, this creates a cash cow.  Unfortunately for the fans, they are a little brainwashed by the fun exciting idea of super hereos, to the point where they don't notice how bad the writing/acting is.

I still watch the show, hoping that it will all of a sudden be as good as the hype says it already is... but it continues to depress me.  The new season is introducing a blatant Sauron ripoff from Lord of the Rings as the new bad guy, and I'm convinced the infamous Cheerleader's power is... well... being clumsy.  The only way she ever shows her ability is when she falls off something.  She's pretty worthless.  Zachary Quinto and Hayden Pannettiere do a pretty good job acting, with the rest of the crew just kinda acting their way through a high school play with a really nice budget.

Perhaps the best part is they show's symbol.  An eclipsing sun, which has yet to really be brought up or make any sense in the show.

If the writers were forced to make this show only 2 or 3 seasons long, perhaps all the good stuff would happen.... but since the networks nowadays want each show to last 10 seasons... they will milk it and stretch it out for as many boring, unfullfilling action-less episodes as they can.

Now we have a Samsung 40"" LCD HDTV 1080p set with an Xbox 360 Elite and HD DVD player. So I purchased the Heroes season 1 in HD and I have to say the picture quality is absolutely amazing!  The web enabled features are nice but we got bored with that after a while. My girlfriend is watching the entire 1st season over again because the HD quality makes it a completely different experience.  I even find myself watching it with her now and I was someone who wasn't into this show before.  There is however one important thing that I think people should be aware of and that is, if you plan to play this on your Xbox 360 HD DVD player you may have an issue with disk #2 not playing.  I returned my first copy because I thought disk #2 was broke but when my second copy did the same thing I researched the Internet and found a forum (on Amazon) coincidentally and discovered that other people were having the same issue and that all we (xbox 360 owners) had to do was go into the HD DVD memory and delete the `unknown' files (cookies) and after a short file download with disk #2 in the player, the movie started playing just fine.

Tim Kring, the creator of the show knows how to create a universe and mythology that draws you in an wanting more after every episode.

Great, sympathetic characters with flaws, trying to deal with all the same stuff that the rest of us do, discover they have something ""special"" that the rest of us don't.

Put in a fantastic plot drawing all of these likeable people together on a worthy and heroic task to defeat an uber-nasty and you have an addictive show.

This should be allocated a grading under the control of narcotics laws.  Once you watch one episode it's ""just 1 more"" until you realise that the sun is coming-up and work is only a few hours away.

This show is written SO BLOODY WELL.  It borrows from the nobility of Arthurian legend (Peter Petrelli, Hiro Nakamura et al.) and crosses it with the best suspense and plot twist elements of Kiefer Sutherland's 24.

Do yourself a favor, and get this set.  The commentaries are uneven---some are insightful, but sometimes you just hear cast members fondly recalling things that happened among themselves.  But I enjoyed listening to those, too.

I started watching this series when it came on the SciFi channel earlier this year.  Unfortunately, I missed a few episodes so had to start again when the series was repeated on BBC2.  I got to episode 6 and then could not wait to see the rest, hence buying the box set from Amazon.com as it does not appear in the UK until December.  I am very glad that I did!  The UK version of this box set is over twice the price with fewer extras and, as I said, will not be available until December (extremely annoying).  I am now buying all of my boxsets from Amazon.com as much cheaper and can get them much sooner!  Anyway, onto review of the series.

Although the show takes a few episodes to pick up, once it does, it is amazingly addictive and after episode 12, I had to watch all of them back to back!  The only thing I would nitpick is that the series builds up and builds up and then the finale falls a bit flat.  Apart from this though, it is a fantastic show with very well developed characters, which is what kept me entralled.  I was a bit baffled by the character who could melt kitchen appliances though.  He must have been at the very back of the queue when they were handing out the superpowers!

Overall, I would recommend this box to set any Heroes fan as the episodes are all there, including the extended first episode, and the extras are plentiful and interesting.  An extremely good buy!",1190246400,,1554,4.728624535315985
2836691,5,B000QDLSR0,"Even though its NBC, they did make a really good sci-fi show while making it a little more family friendly than it would have been on say, the Sci Fi Channel. Although this is not to say that anything was subtracted. If anything, they actually took a failure and made it awesome. If you watch the ""Tim Kring Cut"" or something that is the original vision of the show (the pilot) it is much darker than how the show turned out when it went public.

For example, Isaac Mendez (the artist) doesn't at all look or act like a heroin addict. In the pilot he still was acting the same except that when he tried to quit cold turkey he cut off his hand to get high.

Another good thing they cut from the original shows direction was that the heroes would've been chasing a nuclear powered Islamic dude, being forced by his terrorist buddies to make a bomb in New York. I am very glad this was not 24 with super powered people running around. That would have just been a terribly good way to ruin a show about the fantastic.

If you like stories about super heroes, especially those resembling Marvel's universe, check this show out.",1190246400,,1122,4.384615384615385

Thanks for the additional discount so I got them for a better price than the lowest store in town!!
Thanks Amazon.com",1190246400,,296,4.462962962962963
2836693,1,B000QDLSR0,"I wanted to like Heroes. I really, really wanted to like it. I've been proud of the major networks for having the stones to air serialized shows (shows with long, linear plots), such as 24 or LOST. Heroes seems to be NBC's attempt and, no matter much I hate to say it, the show is weak in just about every possible way.

My first gripe: the characters are little more than human plot devices. There is no psychological realism, and often the characters are so unbelievable it's laughable. For the sake of time, I'll focus on Hayden Panattiere, whose character and story arc are the most offensive. Not one thing about her character feels natural, particularly the way she discovers and deals with her incredible healing power. The writers couldn't have given a moment's thought to how a real teenage girl would handle it, or, more to the point, how her character specifically would deal with it. Instead, they put a cookie-cutter blond into extreme, visually shocking situations that could only appeal to simple-minded viewers.

Her story arc is downright silly. She begins by throwing herself off of a bridge onto hard ground, repeatedly, and having her friend videotape it. She rushes into a burning train wreck to save a stranger, then avoids taking the credit. What, exactly, is her motivation? She'll videotape her thoroughly unbelievable (as in, yeah, right, like anyone would do this) experiments, even referring to herself by name as though she intends someone to see it, but won't take the credit for performing an act of heroism?

The writer's don't know her motivations because they're too busy concocting more silly situations for gross-out makeup and special FX. She is accidentally tackled during football practice, resulting in her head being snapped completely backward. Makes sense, right? Then, in an attempted rape, she falls and, wouldn't you know, her head is impaled on a broken-off tree branch. Hate when that happens. Then we find her on an autopsy table where her torso is open and as clean as a cadaver. Cool, huh? Finally there's the intentional car accident she uses to try and murder her would-be rapist . . . who is also beyond ridiculous as a character. My god, not only does he try and rape her, which we find he's done to other girls, without any consequences at all, but he tries to dispose of her body after her unfortunate head-impaling accident.

The guy is a cross between every cliche, clean cut bad-guy-in-good-guy's-clothing from every cliche teen show you've ever watched, and, like, Jeffery Dahmer.

I could go on, and branch off into all the other ludicrous ""characters""
and ""story arcs"", but it'd just be more of the same. The fact is this is an ill-conceived ripoff of the X-Men, with empty characters and story lines which are at their best illogical, and at their worst downright dumb.

Stories are all about subtle power, intelligent details and above all else, the human element. I'm not saying there should never be eye-popping moments. They just need to be balanced, and happen in a world of characters we love (or love to hate) and situations we connect with and believe in. In terms of this, Heroes is practically a master class in what not to do.",1190160000,30,3201,4.8321167883211675
2836694,1,B000QDLSR0,"I read many reviews about this show saying it was complex with a wonderful story and captivating characters.  I also read many editorial reviews stating I should believe the hype of this show and that it suck you in and make you love it.
Please understand that this is not true.
First of all, I really love serialized shows like Lost, Deadwood and Prison Break, but then again I do prefer my shows to feel like they are dealing w/ real characters in extreme situations.  The problem w/ these characters, (milo v's character, the cheerleader, and hiro's character in particular) are compounded by cliche writing about ""following some convulted ""destiny or dream"" and about the moral obligation ""us superheroes"" have to save the world.
To me it seems like the creators were living and breathing in some pop culture world and took their screen writing skills either directly ripped of from xfiles, lost, and xmen and combined them with the tabloid garbage found in people magazine.  I wanted to believe this show could be good but that is just not the case.  In satisfies those living in a sheltered world who don't live w/ real day to day issues and who don't want their shows to do anything but appeal to the lowest common denominator.  Don't get sucked in.  This show is horrible.",1190160000,20,1280,4.7174887892376685

2836696,5,B000QDLSR0,"I am not a fan of series on television as they are basically poor when it comes to connecting each show together.  This missing thread is what could pull a series together and make it a classic.  Sure you can get into the characters and each show stands alone if you like them, but good it's not.
However, Heroes has a rope for a ""thread"" tying the series together and making it exciting to follow each show.  The writers are exceptionally good and almost all episodes are riveting.  It is a wonder that anyone can watch episodes out of order and still stay interested.  Having the series on one DVD set and watching it in order is the only way to watch this future classic.
I love this series, and from one that would rather not view one, this one is worthy.
Highly recommended.",1190160000,,779,4.381944444444445

YAY!",1189987200,,127,5.35
2836699,4,B000QDLSR0,"Very inventive, very confusing (lots of hanging threads left unexplained- for later season(s) maybe?) but I still think possibly the best of the new shows from the 2006/2007 season. The look of the show, the attention to detail- there's much more here than most series have to offer. I always took it as a sort of introduction prior to future adventures, some of the material confusing but mostly making sense by season's end.
If you did happen to miss seeing most or all of the series you definitely won't be getting a comedy here, you will get action and a little horror- it's almost worth watching for the special effects alone. I think Claire, the cheerleader, died at least 8 times this season- Hayden Panetierre had some of the best scenes and lines in the episodes.

The deleted scenes don't usually add much, it's obvious why they were cut- to fit the time slot better. The packaging makes a big deal out of the unaired pilot, I'll bet well over half of it was used in the first broadcast episode (and a bit in episode 4). The network was probably afraid of offending a certain ethnic group when they had it cut- it's interesting but not much to miss. There's a DL scene at the end of it that appears to have been part of another scrapped episode, it doesn't even go with the ""pilot"".

I haven't tried the commentaries so I don't know how ""good"" they are but the extra's are worthwhile, I enjoyed seeing how the time freeze scenes are created and the cartoonist's background bit. It would have been nice to see more of the effects stuff explained but maybe I'm wanting too much.

The set is worth owning and I can't wait to see what Season Two will be like.",1189987200,,1665,4.470394736842105

2836701,5,B000QDLSR0,"In a day and age where television is dominated by mindless trifle, a show like ""Heroes"" is, to borrow from the title of one its exciting chapters, a Godsend. Thanks to an excellent team of writers and a top notch ensemble cast, ""Heroes"" takes a cliched and dated concept (""Ordinary people with extraordinary powers"" - like that hasn't been done before) and breathes new life into it with suspenseful storylines and well developed characters.

The 23 episodes of the first season of ""Heroes"" give us an in-depth view of the show's central characters, and what a diverse assortment of characters there are. At the core of this cast of normal people with abnormal characteristics is Claire Bennett (Hayden Panettiere), a seemingly ordinary Texas cheerleader who has the ability to heal herself from any wound. There's Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar), a New York congressional candidate with the power to take to the skies at any given moment, and his brother Peter (Milo Ventimiglia), a male nurse with the ability to absorb the abilites of his fellow heroes. Comic book artist Isaac Mendez (Santiago Cabrera) hs the ability to paint future events before they can occur, while Asian cubicle dweller Hiro Nakimura (Masi Oka) can penetrate the space-time continuum. Cop Matt Parkman (Greg Grunberg) can  And of course there's Niki Sanders (Ali Larter), a broke Vegas housewife whose husband (Leonard Roberts) is fugitive and whose alter ego, Jessica, is becoming a burden, to say the least. Oh, and there's a brain stealing serial killer named Sylar (a brilliant Zachary Quinto) targeting the Heroes.

All of these characters (and a few more) seemingly have nothing to with each other, but slowly become intertwined with each other as the show progresses. As the story developes, so do the characters, and the development is excellent. As the show progresses, it's not hard to develope a certain sympathy or level of relatability to each of the characters. You feel for the characters, empathize with them, fear for their lives.

The writing on the show is excellent. Each episode has a good amount of well crafted twists and turns imbued with healthy doses of humor, occasional romance, and a good deal of excitement. The special effects and stunts for the show are just as impressive as the writing and acting.

As I've mentioned, the performances on the show are universally excellent. Hayden Panettiere stands head and shoulders above most of Hollywood's crop of teen starletts by imbuing Claire with a legitimate amount of depth and believability. Even though she comes out okay, you still worry for her anyway. Masi Oka is fantastic as Hiro. Hiro in many ways is the show's comic relief, a fish out of water in the classic sense, and Masi portrays it to a T. Ventimiglia and Pasdar, as brothers in name only, play off each other quite well and the chemistry between them is really felt when they are onscreen together. Quinto makes for an amazing villian, turning Sylar into a modern Hannibal Lecter. And Ali Larter does an excellent job conveying duel personalities. Also of note is renowned character actor Jack Coleman, who plays Claire's adoptive father. Though without powers, he is for a good half of the season the most intriguing character. His motives are questionable, and you are often left wandering what side he's really playing for.

The dvd set is loaded with a wealth of extras, none of which I have watched yet. But watch the episodes before anything. ""Heroes"" is a completely engrossing, superbly crafted masterpiece of a show that will hopefully stay around for years to come.",1189814400,,3596,4.97504159733777

It wasn't over the top and the characters were real people going through things.  It was a TV drama with a twist.  I watched the entire season as it was airing and I rewatched episodes on my DVR.  Then, when I got the DVD, I watched it all again over two days.

2836705,5,B000QDLSR0,"This box set was released simultaneously in a great amount of countries, including here in Brazil. Since ""Lost"" debut, I have never seen any other TV series that caused so much buzz in the local market as ""Heroes"" is causing right now. Success on paid TV (episodes are aired here with an average delay of four months after its original exhibition on US broadcast TV) and, apparently, success also on DVD, as stores are flooded with posters and full shelves with a lot of boxes waiting for its customers.

I own this box set and I should say that this show is smartly conceived, well produced and an eye-catching attraction. All to the point that made me watch all discs (including the extras) in only one week after purchase, while most of times I take much more than this to view a box set entirely.

Expectations for the second season (premiere date is just around the corner) are very high and Tim Kring (the creator of the show) will have a tough task for the next weeks to keep ourselves tuned into the next episodes. Is Sylar really dead? What ever happened to Peter and Nathan Petrell? Will Parkman survive to the shootings? What about the other heroes?

Such elaborated plots are attractive while they can and I hope that it will last long. For the time being, ""Heroes"" is, in my honest opinion, the most pleasant surprise of the last 2006-2007 season. This is a box worth buying. Go ahead and enjoy it.",1189555200,,1411,4.547244094488189

About terrorism and distrustful government officials and people working behind the scenes of our lives and even a sort of 9/11 catastrophe of greater proportions looming in the foreground of the plot.  But the writers or director or both were a bit lazy because there are lots of illogical flaws in the series as well, and sometimes it feels as if they figured their viewers wouldn't be smart enough to see those flaws, and that occasionally made me a little perturbed.

2836721,5,B000QDLSR0,"Heroes as a series, is just fantastic.  A little corny at times (which is nice) but overall a great achievement in directing, acting, casting, music and art direction. Especially for the network it's on. The series is a little slow at first till about episode 5 to do character introductions.  I break the season into 3 parts.  1 being introductions, 2 being more action with saving the cheerleader and 3 becoming darker when Sylar (Quinto= best villian on TV in a long time) gets into full effect and they have to try & stop a nuclear explosion.  I'm not going to get into other characters because they all have great stories to tell (nicki & parkman's are a little boring though until the end).  I'm a huge Lost & BSG fan and Heroes was fresh when the other 2 shows faltered just a little in the middle of their 3rd seasons.

As a HD DVD set- this is the kind of set that makes me feel bad for people with bluray only players just as I can't get certain movies on HD that are on bluray.  It only makes me hate the format war even more.  Everyone should be able to enjoy the extras on this set.  The amount of extras and the way they are delivered are unbelievable.  I absolutely love the picture in picture feature for commentaries and the graffic art stuff.  Most of the picture quality is always super (8.5 of 10) while certain parts are reference quality (10 of 10).  And that's on a bigger screen so folks with 42"" or smaller HD sets will be watching an almost flawless picture.  I've read reviews that complained a little about the lack of surround effects in the series but it is not a major deal as I didn't find a problem with it.  When you listen to the DD+ through a really nice setup, you'll hear all the subtle effects.  Overall- another benchmark for extras on a TV set and amazing picture quality in HD.  Just a plain GREAT show.",1189123200,,1845,4.335276967930029
2836722,5,B000QDLSR0,"As a long time comic book fanboy I had my doubts about Heroes. Actually, I wanted to hate it. I thought that it was going to be a show cashing in on the increasing popularity of movies like X-Men and Spider-Man. After viewing the season in it's entirety on DVD I'm pleased to say that I love the show. I think it's what many fanboys have been dreaming of. An action-packed, creative and intelligent show that reveals the kind of mature writing comic books often have. ""Heroes"" is about what the title implies. Across the globe people begin to discover that they posses unique abilities. Some can walk through walls, stop time, or read minds. The main plot follows the heroes as they try to stop a bomb from going off in New York City. No one knows were the bomb is or who is going to detonate it. but thanks to the time traveling Hiro, they know they only have a limited amount of time. What's nice about Heroes is that while the show moves steadily with the main plot, it balances itself by going off on numerous subplots that reveal the individual heroes stores like Clare's relationship with her mysterious hero kidnapping dad, Hiro(My favorite character) learning the code of the samurai,Peter and Nickie's family problems and the creepy hero killing Sylar. They all mesh amazingly well and keep the show watchable and very addictive(in my case anyway)If you're a sci fi fan, comic book fan or just a fan or great TV, Heroes is your show.",1189036800,4,1442,4.571428571428571
2836723,5,B000QDLSR0,"I never watched the show on tv.  last week my brother loaned me his dvd set.  Am now hooked on the series, terrific story line and production values, my only disappointment is that some of the acting is poor -- but most of the cast is excellent.  The DVD set is excellent.  Outstanding packaging which includes summaries of each episode on every disk.  Pictures are crisp and clear, and sound is excellent. DVD set is loaded with extras:  audio commentaries, deleted scenes on each disk, also on the last disk a making of, special effects, stunts score, and profile of tim sale the artist.  here is rundown of what is on each disk:

Because of this show, we went and purchased the HD-DVD drive for our Xbox 360.  If you enjoy shows and stories of people developing superhuman abilities, this is a must see.  Get caught up on season one before season two begins in late September.

2836725,5,B000QDLSR0,"Heroes is an amazing show.  Tim Kring built a show that is so deep, that every episode, moment, and line means something.

Mohinder Suresh searches for the man that killed his father, at the same time, he's trying to fulfill his father's work.  His father studied advancents in the human genes.  A number of people around the world have these adavancements, ""powers"", and don't know about it yet.

We first meet Peter Petrelli, a nurse overshadowed by his political older brother.  There's Claire Bennett, a normal high school cheerleader.  Also are Niki Sanders and her son Micah, her ex-husband DL, Matt Parkman, Isaac Mendez, Claire's ""normal"" father Mr. Bennett, and Hiro Nakamura.

The cast is wonderful.  Everyone plays their part convinvingly and perfectly.

Included in this set is Tim Kring's 73 minute Unaired Premiere Episode (In His Own Hands).  There's also 50 minutes of Deleted Scenes, 12 or so Audio Commentaries on various episodes including a bevy of cast members, plenty of featurettes:  The Making of Heroes, The Special Effects, The Stunts, etc.

I highly recommended this series.  It's is definitely a must have.  Hopefully you'll get it before the next season starts, September 24, 2007.  This is one of the best shows on television.  And the packaging is wonderful.

Definite Must Have.",1188950400,7,1310,5.070422535211268
2836726,1,B000QDLSR0,"So Far I have enjoyed the actual series, Which I ordered pre-release. BUT the DVDs are so poorly recorded that they are essentially unwatchable on my DVD player and TV.  Finally resorted to using the DVD-ROM player on my computer, and even that has had terrible problems, Lots of artifacting, hangups and outright crashes,  I have seen bootleg copies of movies that were better made.",1188950400,13,383,4.876923076923077
2836727,5,B000QDLSR0,"While I was a considerable Heroes nut during the first season's original tv airing, I was open to the possibility that I might only be excited over something new and different, and I cautiously took my own enthusiasm with a grain of salt.  However, even greater appreciation the second time around has to mean something.

I do not believe this is just fad, this show.  By all critiques I could put out, it's fantastic.  It follows a rather classic idea of comic-book superheroes with mutant powers.  Yes, it's been done before, but there is nothing wrong with doing it again and having it work--just recognize that it has its own twist through keeping its little mutants as normal and human as possible.

They cover a broad group of people:  a stressed teenager, a single mother, an average joe cop, a university professor, etc.  Yet no one ever becomes a stereotype (though the show, on occasion, playfully brings them in).  They all have their own, considerably normal, storylines and very human desires.  These are people with whom we can relate.

Then, of course, we toss in the fantasy/superhero angle.  Another fresh blend of superpowers and ominous foreshadowing of world destruction.  Great, fun stuff.  Among the challenges of pregnant wives, dead fathers, and boys there is an intruding single plot that draws in everything else.  It's clever, classic, and wonderfully spooky.

But thankfully the show never takes itself too seriously.  Fortunately it is so seemingly ordinary that it's hard to get too wacky or cheesy.  I find myself laughing during the most suspenseful scenes due to subtle, witty humor.

All of these gather together in an incredible emotion that is never forced, but still keeps you feeling strongly for all of these characters and what they are going through.  It plays out almost like a comic book (indeed, the comics are a common theme), and this is what keeps me addictively hooked on each episode.

Now to the DVD set itself.  It's probably one of the most gorgeous boxes I have ever held, and the bonus features simply rock.  I appreciate the documentaries on stunts and special effects.  Oddly enough, they add an extra emotional aspect (from the perspective of the creative artists) that make me appreciate the story all the more.

It's funny, tender, exciting, and overpowering in so many ways.  It is primarily a story of people who care for one another.  Definitely a keeper in the tv world.",1188864000,7,2433,4.885085574572127
2836728,5,B000QDLSR0,"I hadn't seen any of the broadcasts, but this is a fun series. It looks great on HD DVD; and there are tons of extra features included. Personally, I hate the fold out packaging and would have preferred a thinner box with slimcases, but this is a minor quibble. If you are fan and have an HD DVD player, this is a great set.",1188864000,5,324,4.078125
2836729,4,B000QDLSR0,"I loved Heroes as i love Lost, those two series i think redefine how tv shows had to be done. Incredible acting, great stories and a lot of action and suspense.-",1188864000,2,161,4.225806451612903
2836730,5,B000QDLSR0,"I just recently purchased the DVD set and watched the season from start to finish, as I had previously missed roughly the first half of the series. I must say that this is one of the best series I have seen in a very long time (with the exception of Lost and The Shield) and I do not see how anyone in the world could not like this show. It has everything....drama, suspense, horror, sci-fi, etc. It is very well written, well acted, well executed, and as a previoud viewer already stated, did not seem to suffer the fate of the X-files by the writers not knowing where they wanted to show to go (I did love this show until it fell miserably apart).

Thus being said, I give this show and DVD five stars hands down. However, I do have to comment on the one major fault of this show: the season finale. And I am not even talking about the finale in its entirety, which for the most part was thrilling and very good. I am mainly talking about the last quarter of the show, the so-called ""crux"" the whole show had been focused on - the meeting of Sylar, Peter and Hiro (SPOILER ALERT: DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE SHOW).

I am not certain as what happened here, or what the writers were at all thinking. They built and built and built this thing up, and then it just went out not with a bang but a mere whimper. And again, I cannot ascertain why since the writing never seemed to suffer once through the whole season. To me, it felt hurried, not well thought out and like they just wanted to conclude it so that they could show you the prelude to the next season. And here are some questions and/or suggestions I have that I felt would have made the end so much better and so much more satisfying to all:

1) Sylar has acquired all these powers and seemed to be such a menacing villian (actually one of the best I have ever seen). You telling me he just STANDS THERE and lets Hiro run at him with a sword, and doesn't do one thing at all to stop it???? Come on - this guy was a bad-ass and deserved better!!!! The writers could have at least had him trying to fight back, and have Hiro have to ""teleport"" up close to him so that he had literally NO TIME to react and THEN have Hiro plunge the sword in. This would also make sense since Hiro had previously been quicker than Sylar in their first meeting. It makes no sense to me at all when Sylar can stop bullets, flip trucks, hurl objects and do about everything else with all his powers. Final battles should be very intense and dramatic, not go out with a little puff of air. Plus, with all that training and excellent sword fighting skills that Hiro was doing with his father, he ended up looking like a little scared kid running at Sylar with a stick. Sigh.....

2) Remember the scene in the future when Peter and Sylar started fighting right before Hiro and Ando teleported back to Japan? That battle behind the door looked bad as hell, and they could have least had them trade powers like that in the real-time final battle. Come on now...Peter has all these powers and he has to resort to doing nothing more than simply punching Sylar a few times in the face? He could have at least put a telekentic hold on Sylar (since he apparently had this power too) and held Sylar in place so that Hiro could run at him with the sword (that would make more sense!!! - see previous gripe). OR - he could have started getting his hands to glow with the nuclear fire and exchange a few blows with fireballs - THEN - that could end up leading to the fact that the power is too much and ends up getting away from him, causing him to start down his foretold path to exploding.

3) In Peter's dreams and visions, he keeps seeing himself blow up and losing control of the power and exploding rather quickly. In the final moments, he has enough time to sit down and drink tea with all the others. I mean, he literally could have had time to catch a bus and leave New York for that matter LOL. Think about it - he has time to watch Sylar fall, have a conversation with Claire, and then have a nice conversation with Nathan before they end up flying off. Doesn't make sense. I felt NO sense of urgency at all. For that matter, Peter could fly as well - why couldn't he have just flown up into space without Nathan?? Or...why couldn't have Claire just shot him without hesitation since he can regenerate? They could have then taken his dead body out into the desert, removed the bullet like they did the piece of glass. Then he could have come back alive, blown up, healed himself and then gone about his business without hurting anyone. Maybe I am reading too much into it, but I just don't think this angle was thought through well enough. And I don't understand WHY - the writers are genious and I KNOW they could have done better!!!!

4) New York always exploded in the daytime in the future - did the writers not notice this fact since the final battle took place at night?

Again, these my only complaints with the show at all. Besides that, I love this series and definitely am eagerly awaiting Season 2. But I just don't see what anyone was thinking when they sat down and wrote the final few moments of the show, especially after ALL the lead-up to it. I don't think I am the only one who thinks this either? Oh well, it is Mr. Kring's show, not mine. And I would still highly recommend purchasing this show, and I will end up watching this again and again. And for the people who totally pan this show intheir reviews, pay no mind. They have no idea what they are talking about and I think they just complain just to hear themselves complain. I mean - WHAT kind of show do these people need to be satisfied?????",1188777600,2,5668,4.25719591457753

*First Episode Spoiler Warning*
For those of you that want to get an idea of what your in for before you buy the season set, i have decided to give a brief written summary of the beginning of the first episode, if you don't want to know what happens then do not read on.
The episode basically begins with Peter standing on top of a 20 foot building looking out into the horizon, his arms spread open and the wind waving his hair he plunges off of the building and as he is speeding towards the ground you get a glimpse of Nathans face before the screen goes white and you are taken back to Peter who is now sitting on a chair with his nurse coat on apparently day dreaming.  After you get a small glimpse at what Peter's life is like, you are taken to Mohinder Suresh who is giving a lecture on the possibility of human potential and the idea that the most fully evolved creature is a cockaroach, while giving this lecture he is interrupted by one of his fathers old collegues who brings him the news of his father's death.  Mohinder then decides that he wants to finish his fathers research and so he takes a trip to his father's apartment to acquire clues on what his father was working on, while there, he finds that he is not alone, there is someone else who seems to be interested in his father's research as well.  Mohinder then takes a certain something from his fathers archives and leaves the room unnoticed.  Now you are taken to Claire who seems to be making some sort of a home movies considering she is being seen through the lens of a camera, Claire begins to climb about two stories onto the ledge of a construction site about 80 feet from ground level, the camera man utters something about how insane this is and then you see Claire plummeting two stories face first, the camera man begins to express his concern for her well being and begins to run towards her, Claire then gets up relocates her dislocated shoulder and says to the camera, ""attempt number 6,"" while a bloody gash over her forhead begins to disappear..............

Want to know what happens next?  Well your just going to have to see for yourself.

This is the solid package, one full season of one of the best shows on television in perfect high defenition format, and believe me when i say it looks beautiful, if only the stupid format war would end then the consumer wouldn't have to suffer, i wish that those that have a blue ray player would be able to get to enjoy this also.

To wrap things up, you've got a great show in beautiful high def format, at a great price considering it is 23 one hour episodes, i recommend this to anyone who likes a good super hero story.",1188691200,,4011,4.4842249657064475

As far as tv on dvd I only purchased teleanovela's on dvd before but not an american show before.
I loved this show enough that I made and exception and that was easy since I missed a lot of episodes due to work.
I taped them and I never got the chance to look at them so this was my chance to catch up.
Like I said I normally do not by episodic tv on dvd I loved this show and I thought it would be worth it.
With that being said the dvd does start each chapter with previously on heroes and each dvd offers deleted scenes for the particular chapters on that disc and bonus materials.
There is an play all feature for the deleted scenes on each disc which is nice I loved seeing what did not air on tv.
Season one on dvd offers the original unaired pilot amoung other extras concerning the score,making of heroes,the stunts, mind reader game,comentaries with the cast and creator Tim Kring.
I did love seeing Wendy and Lisa from Prince and the Revolution fame they do and  fantasic job with the score.
The dvd quality is excellent and since I have nothing else to compare this to since I normally do not by tv shows on dvd. I think this set is great for what it is an wrap up of the first season of an fantastic show.

Got to say Heroes is one of the best shows I've seen.. Beats a lot of stupid movies.. When you do get a really good movie it is done in 2 hours if your lucky..

I honestly expected more extras.  I don't like HD so i bought the basic DVD set, and it said it contained nearly 3 hours worth of extras.  Yes, it does, 73 minutes of such are the un-aired pilot which i honestly wasn't all that thrilled about.

I gave it four stars because the show is superb, the case it comes in is brilliant, and the few special features i do get to see are entertaining, but i was expecting more.  If you love the series, buy the dvd set. Just don't expect much for extras.",1188604800,5,633,4.225

I have to say that this show is amazing. From the opening credits of episode one to the season finale. I could not stop watching. I watched the entire season in one seating. This is what they should have done with the x-men. The x-men stories are too big and complex to be told in a mere two hours. They had no business being put on the big screen. Tim Kring is a very smart man. Stan Lee the x-men creator himself took his hat off to him. By playing a cameo role as a bus driver in season one. This show is going to go on for a very long time.

The first season of 'Heroes' is the paradigm of today's television.  It's both mindless and mindful all at the same time.  The high production values and top quality scripts make for riveting television.

The writers never go to far in terms of cheese and create a human drama that is rarely matched by their sci-fi-less counterparts.  Tim Kring has crafted a slew of relatable characters from the loveable Hiro to foxy Niki.  There is no arch-type with the exception of the villainous Sylar and even he exceeds those typical boundaries one is used to seeing in a super villain.

As a fan of both comic books and science fiction, creator Tim Kring and his excellent writing staff have crafted a show that molds both of these genres together.

Heroes is in it's own league on television. Not only do we have a great ensemble of characters, but also a threatening and menacing, supervillian.

2836739,5,B000QDLSR0,I thought that television had become nothing but a wasteland of reality television until the past 3 years. All of a sudden the return of the great sitcom and now the dramatic television programs on network tv are finally overshadowing HBO. Heroes is the return to glory for NBC because it came into the superhero hype to create an origional story about ordinary people becomeing extraordinary. Unlike the well known super-hero stories Heroes takes a very human look into people from all walks of life discovering they are gifted. The writting is fantastic because it feels like you are reading a comic book. The show is build around visuals and very easy to follow dioligue. This all comes from a guy who had never read comic books in his life and went to some of the most well known in the business to write the first chapter of what could a historical television program. I had not seen this show as it aired on TV but picking up this DVD set showed me that this show really was everything I though it was going to be and I am very much looking forward to seeing where the story will go. I would love to see a team of supervillians in the seasons to come.,1188518400,,1157,4.411214953271028
2836740,4,B000QDLSR0,"I had very low expectations coming into the series. Even though I was excited about it, I felt it was jumping on the superhero bandwagon. Well, if that is so, Heroes does it with grace and intelligence.

First seasons have the challenge of enticing and keeping viewers while maintaining the original concept. There are only a few bumps along the way in this season, (over-exposure of less interesting characters and some uneven episodes) but Heroes has proven to be a solid show a majority of the time.

I am not quite sure what happened with the season finale. It almost appears as if they ran out of money, time or (dare I say it) ideas. It isn't bad, just not as explosive as the hype lead viewers to believe. I hope the show is setting the stage for a better second season opener. I'm counting on it.

I expected more extras and maybe a comic booklet, but no real complaints. It's not easy to package a seven-disk set. An interesting surprise in one of the featurettes discloses the actor that plays Hiro, Masi Oka, once worked as an effects technician for Industrial Light and Magic!

2836743,4,B000QDLSR0,"I'll be picking up my boxed set this weekend, but really, I'm not buying this for the extras, although they need more mention.  This is just a review of the tv series from my PoV.  Total rating is 4.5 stars.

This type of show really is character-driven as opposed to plot-driven; the point is to get to know these characters as opposed to doing a ""villian of the week"" show like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".  Yes, there was the plot device of ""New York City is in danger!"", but each week was really about the characters and getting to know them.  So that's my focus.  The characters were brilliantly played.  Unlike many fans of the show, I actually found Nathan and Nikki to be my faves.  Adrian Pasdar is an excellent and really underrated actor who brought a different side to the show.  While everyone was in love with Peter and Hiro's joy of being superpowered, and everyone related to the high school angst of Claire's outsider status, I think Nathan represented the adult whose life has just been given the major upheaval by, well, life. He was a needed character, and Adrian Pasdar was a great casting decision.  Nikki was an interesting twist as a character.  I like Ari Lightner, but I wasn't 100% sure what the character was all about.  Once I learned more about her, I really liked her.  The split personality worked for me, but I'm glad it got integrated by the end of the season.  And lest I forget, Matt.  Matt, to me, also made some very interesting decisions throughout the season, and I wonder what the fallout will be in September.  He took a turn which I dind't see coming, but am not surprised with.  It was needed to keep him interesting.  Hiro, Claire, Isaac, DL, Peter... they were all great characters.  Skylar was an excellent villian, and HRG was certainly a character who provided endless hours of speculation.  It's going to be interesting to see what the show does next season.  Are Peter and Nathan dead?  What about Ando now that Hiro is in feudal Japan?  Is Matt among the living?  Is Sylar alive?  And what about Kirsten Bell, Dania Ramirez, and Nichelle Nichols, all brilliant casting decision for characters to come.

The camoes and guest characters provided some great plot development, especially for Matt... let's face it, telepaths are boring, so he needed a good story.  And Clea DuVall, one of the most underrated actresses around, gave it to him.  The Invisible Man, George Takei, Eden, and all the others served good purposes, weren't just cannon fodder, and I wanted them all to join the cast!

Half a star deduction for:
-the finale.  It was overall great, but it needed to be longer.  The ""climactic battle"" was anything but.  It reminded me of the bad flick that was ""Generation X"" staring Finola Hughes and based on the Marvel Comic of the same name.  It was really campy and hokey by the end.  I wanted it to be better.
-The decision by NBC to ""unout"" Claire's buddy Zach, then write him off the show.  I see a lot of people pleased with the racially diverse cast, and I agree, but to have a fake myspace page for the kid listing him as ""questioning"" and then redo everyone's memories and make him straight then get rid of him was a very poor decision by NBC, IMO.  Gay kids deserve role models, too, you know.
- They hype.  I think the fault really should be laid at the feet of the NBC PR crew.  THEY made the ads.  NBC missed the mark a few times with marketing.  Not the show.  But it does factor into my decion to give this a 4.5 star review marked by four instead of five stars.  The show needs to deliver, and there were times it didn't.  I loved the arcs, and ""Save the Cheerleader"", ""Are You on the List"" and the other marketing campaigns were great.  Except that they were usually a week or two ahead of the actual episode which was aired.

Do I recommend this show, of course.  It's quality television.  Overall very well written and acted, and it's something you could sit down with the kids and watch without worry.  There were a few ""gross out"" scenes, usually involving Claire and Sylar, which may scare younger viewers, but it's something I'd let my niecesd and nephews watch.  Minimal swearing, not in-your-face, over the top and constant sexuality, simulated comic-book-esque violence make this a show for most viewers.

Most of the 2006 season hasn't graduated.  Really, what are the real carry overs?  Oh, right, NBC's ""Heroes"" and ABC's ""Ugly Betty"".  That's really it.  For all the bad reviews of the show, the numbers and survivial and overall critical and fan acclaim speak for themselves.  And just because I can't resist, ignore the haters.  ""Lost"" fans are disgruntled because this season fell apart, and ""Battlestar Glactica"" fans are annoyed fanboys whose favorite show will never get picked up by a major network and they're just jealous of the commercial and critical success this show has pulled off.  ;)",1188432000,5,4886,4.616279069767442
2836744,5,B000QDLSR0,"Taking his inspiration from comic books like ""The Avengers"" and ""Justice League"" as his inspiration writer/producer/creator Tim Kring (""Crossing Jordan"") imagined a world where extraordinary heroes with superhuman capabilities came from ordinary folks. Without solid writing, direction and performances this would be just another wanna-be TV drama as hollow as the 70's TV adaption of ""Spider-Man"". Instead, it's intelligently written (and some of it has been explored in comic books within the last twenty years but no one has explored it as well as Kring's show)with strong performances and direction. The show didn't become a powerhouse ratings sensation based on mindless drivel nor based on the sneak peak at Comic-Com. The show earned its kudos for dealing with a number of fascinating themes in the context of a fantasy.

 I'm going to focus mostly on the quality of the show in this review, the extras and the quality of the DVDs/HD-DVDs and only touch on the storyline assuming most of you know it or have read about it elsewhere. If not, I have a brief synposis of the plot (avoiding spoilers). You can skip the next paragraph if you have seen the show.

Kring uses multiple characters that represent the next stage in human evolution and together have to somehow saved the world from a horrible event (which is revealed fairly early in the show). There are also two subplots involving the search for a serial killer which is somehow tied into the main plot and a mysterious government agency that is tracking these ""ordinary"" heroes for its own mysterious purposes.

First compliments to Kring who learned the lesson of ""The X-Files"" and ""Lost""; know where your story is going and clue your audience in early on so they know there IS a pay off but gradually divulge the details over time. As with ""Lost"" Kring occasionally delves into the back story of these characters but primarily focuses on their journey and the conflicts/collaborations between them. The first season of ""Heroes"" was virtually flawless with impeccable writing and direction (featuring veterans such as film and TV director John Badham) that featured production values you'd see in a feature film. NBC's gamble with ""Heroes"" paid off as after Comic-Con the show generated tremendous buzz (the pilot was shown there). Critics responded and in a rare sign of unity so did TV viewers. Here's hoping that the second season doesn't suffer from the sophomore slum that plagued the second season of ""Lost"". Expectations are high but I suspect that Kring and his team will deliver.

Both the standard and HD version of ""Heroes"" receive a superb transfer from Universal. The image looks sharp with bold colors and terrific of the surround sound effects as well. While I did have a problem with disc three skipping and freezing, I suspect (and hope) this isn't a symptom of Universal's ongoing manufacturing issues that began to plague the studio at the end of 2005.

 First up my only complaint about the show is that there is no chapter placed directly after the main titles. Also, if you watch the individual episodes you are stuck with watching the ""previously on `Heroes'"" tag at the beginning. These aren't necessary and could have been dropped from the set or, at the very least, have a chapter title place so that you could skip them without having to fast forward through the beginning of the episode.

We get the original pilot which had a substantially different subplot involving a terrorist which was completely cut from the show. While it worked pretty well, dropping it was probably wise given the popularity of the theme with shows like ""24"". Writer/producer Tim Kring provides a very good commentary track discussing the changes, details of the shooting and changes the network suggested be made and why he resisted on occasion. The unaired pilot runs longer than the final version by about 20 minutes.

We get 12 other commentary tracks a terrific move from Universal which hasn't always provided much in the way of extras for many of their popular series. The bulk of the commentary tracks are very good with various production members teamed with cast in discussing the making of the episode. This happy mix means that we get both technical information on the shoot as well as on-set info and the take by the actors on the development of their characters and the series.

We get deleted/alternate scenes for a lot of the episodes and you can access them for each one individually. A pity that some of these deleted scenes weren't seamlessly branched as some worked adding to the show and most were cut for time constraints (although there was the occasional episode that truly had deleted scenes because they either didn't work or were superfluous

We get five featurettes, a game and sneak peaks. ""Mind Reader"" is a clever game involving Parkman's ability to reader minds and the old trick of picking a number. The game then picks the number you selected.

""Making of `Heroes'"" is a brief but interesting featurette on the genesis, pitch and development of the show featuring plenty of interviews with Kring, the cast and other snippets of the production team. We also find out about where the show is headed and the response to the show at Comic-Con last year.

""Special Effects"" features visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack discussing how they are able to pull of the CGI for the show, make it look real on a TV time frame and budget.

""Profile of Artist Tim Sale"" allows us to see the guy who really creates the paintings and drawings of the character Isaac Mendez. This veteran of Marvel comics brings just the right element of pop-art to Mendez paintings and the comic book he writes that ends up being pivotal early on in the show.

The Score"" focuses on composers Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman who were members of Prince's Revolution and have collaborated with songwriters Neil Finn (Crowded House) and others. They, in turn, discuss collaborating with Shankar who provides the ethereal vocals for the series.

""The Stunts"" shows how many of the key stunts were created, how the actors participated with on-set wire work and when stunt doubles were used.

Overall this is a terrific set from Universal which could be improved by creating some additional chapter stops, eliminating the preview tags for the previous episodes (something you really don't need on DVD but they should be optional in case you do want them). We do get a play all option which is nice and a series of top notch extras that add value to the set. With the show premiering its second season on September 24 of this year, ""Heroes"" arrives in the nick of time to save the viewer from being puzzled as to what the developments were during season one. Highly recommended.",1188432000,8,6744,4.881118881118881
2836745,3,B000QDLSR0,"Am I the only one that thought the makers of 'Heroes' totally lost it by the time it came to the Season One Finale. It was just so disappointing.

The great thing about this show is:

1. Multiracial Characters : All racial groups are represented in some form or the other. Multiracial identities are accepted and treated as normal, as they should be, obviously.
2. Geographical Insight : I liked that we were shown Japan, Chennai (India) amongst other parts of the world through the series.
3. Superpowers : Yes, none of the powers have truly blown us away yet, but what they've shown us so far is good for us all to hold on and watch more

However, all of these elements converge in the Season Finale to end up in one ridiculous and underwhelming piece of 'ensemble acting' that should be seen to be believed. I felt as if the makers of the show had worked so hard to take me along for the ride, but in the end it was one big lousy joke. I mean really. The 'Epilogue' to Season One was even more mind-numbing than what came before it.

However, I must say that I found two of my favorite new actors on this show, and thats a blessing - Ali Larter (known outside the US for her work in India's ""Marigold""), and Sendhil Ramamurthy, who finally breaks the stereotype of the South Indian male in Western society. It doesn't hurt that these two look supermodel good either. The supporting cast is just fine, though instant celebs like Hayden Panetierre (Claire) and Zachary Quinto are vastly overrated.

Heres the thing - I agree this is a wonderful show and I am buying the DVD set regardless. However, I am hoping that they don't lower their standards for the Season 2 Finale like they did here. A season finale is supposed to bring in the WOW factor, not put you to sleep or make you lose respect for the show. Thats what happened, in my opinion. They should watch 'Prison Break' - now THATS how a Season finale is done.

Highly recommended, but they have got to step it up a notch in Season 2 or else this will end up like ""Invasion"", ""Surface"" and ""Threshold"" (of which ""Invasion"" was vastly superior to this, IMHO)",1188432000,7,2116,4.426735218508997
2836746,5,B000QDLSR0,"It's odd in that Heroes was probably the one new show of 2006-2007 season that I watched from start to finish, having not missed a single episode. Whereas other great shows like Friday Night Lights are critic-adored-yet-audience-deprived or the Nine which was cancelled prematurely, Heroes became a huge hit and a critical favorite. While it initially has some issues, the further the show continues the more confident it gets and while it might not have everyone's ideal finale, it was surely the capper to what's a pretty stellar first season.

What would you do if you found out if you had a superpower? That's the basic for the start of the first season where ordinary people suddenly find they can do amazing abilities; from a regenerating cheerleader to a time-travelling Japanese desk worker to a mind-reading cop. But that doesn't mean that they will all use their power for good as some don't know what to do with it, others want to get rid of it and some might use it for something destructive, such as destroy half of New York. All of these stories interwine as they try to stop a major disaster.

Heroes, like many other shows, as an ongoing arc throughout the entire season, making it feel like one gigantic story split over 23 episodes rather than a series of mini-stories a la CSI or Law and Order. This can be a problem since it might not have a lot of replay value but it also means you just get hooked faster. But luckily the writers know how to make individual episodes stand out, thanks to great drama (the entirely Claire-centric ""Company Man""), stellar cliffhangers and characters. But then this is still their first season so we have a case of them trying to do too much in one episode making it feel kind of scattered.

One of the strongest aspects of the show, aside from the intrigue, are the characters who manage to be distinct without being one-note. Ali Larter is effective in switching personalities right in the same scene and Hayden Panettiere nails that ""wishing to be normal"" feeling when she knows she's not. However the obvious scene stealer is Masi Oka who initially starts out as overly enthusiastic and almost giddy but progresses as the show continues without it feeling forced or unexpectedly sudden. Then we also have Zachary Quinto who plays the season's main villain who has such creepiness and menace when he's around (although he was probably strangely more effective when he was obscured in shadow with a baseball cap on).

In the day and age of TV shows on DVD, it's hard to get a stellar DVD package. Unlike Simpsons or 24 with multiple episode commentaries, most of them are kind of skimpy. Heroes thankfully has pretty solid bonuses with several commentaries, the original unaired pilot as well as some making-ofs as well as tons of deleted scenes. As for the commentaries, while it's kind of disappointing there isn't one for the suspenseful ""Homecoming"", they get more frequent as the season progresses and there is more variety rather than the same writer/director/actor combinations.

With a great sense of pacing, well-written characters and cool superhero moments, it's sort of a show where you can find geekiness yet find something of substance at the same time. Might not be the absolute best show on TV, but it's probably one of the more consistently entertaining.",1188345600,,3325,4.816112084063048
2836747,5,B000QDLSR0,"I just picked this up yesterday and have watched the first 2 episodes, including the unaired pilot, and I have to say this set is as perfect as it gets. To the Makers of the SMALLVILLE HD-DVD sets, take note of how to produce a QUALITY set. Unlike Smallville's Season 5 on HD-DVD, Heroes Season 1 has a MAIN MENU, animations and all. Smallville's episodes simply start playing after you insert the disc, no introductions to the season or episodes at all, no title screen, no fun. And unlike Smallville's, Heroes' box is loaded with ART. Smallville's box is basically completely devoid of art, it's only a space-saver -- BORING and not what collectors like me really want after having paid more money than what the DVD set goes for, which has all of these things.

So if you are thinking about getting an HD-DVD Player, let this be the reason, as HEROES SEASON 1 on HD-DVD is hands down the best TV-on-DVD/HD-DVD set ever created. It is not to be missed.",1188345600,4,953,4.540697674418604

1) i don't know about you all, but my eyes cant go beyond 1080i. if anyone can go beyond that, please email the dudes at NASA so they can use your eyes for the next hubble rev

2)both technologies are quite expensive because of the cost of the blue laser and manufacturing techniques. so don't complain about price because every technology starts off pricey. also, since more bits are required for high-def viewing, you can imagine that there would be more discs needed. so no, more content capacity doesnt mean less discs. That doesn't even make sense anyway unless you love compression artifacts :)

3)Sony had their betamax debacle back in 1975-1988 (hopefully they learned how to market) so look for some good competition between the two formats

4)I am watching Heroes in 73"" of hi-def glory. I would recommend any heroes fan to purchase this hd-dvd (or hd dvd) because it is the only way to be viewed. BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT!",1188345600,2,1065,4.5025906735751295

Not only is HD DVD competing with Blu-ray (the better of the two), but unless BOTH formats start offering content at a more attractive price-point, the new high-definition media is going to fall right on it's face.

This series is really a must buy for any one who ever believed in becoming something more in humans. Though it is very similar to X-Men and other mutant stories, this separates itself by showing very compelling stories that are engrossing and pretty good to decent. I have watched about half of the first episode now and I have to say that the transfer to DVD format has been flawless, it sounds and looks excellent. The special features are very good as well, with the Tim Kring premier episode is also quite interesting. One thing that I would have liked to have seen, but was not included would have been a feature that let you watch each character's story arc separately and in consecutive order. This would have been really cool because now you either have to watch all of the other's stories or manually skip through each episode until you found the stories you want. If they had this feature one could watch the viewer favorite's Hiro, who in my opinion, had the coolest story and character, and his story arc from the first time he reversed time in his office to his transportation to ancient Japan. Although the set does not include this feature this is still a must buy for any one who believes in the possibility of something super in us.",1188259200,,1418,4.478764478764479
2836755,4,B000QDLSR0,"Fall of 2006 saw the debut of many buzzed about shows.  Some went quietly away since they failed to catch the interest of the audience.  But a few caught on big time and took off.  Heroes was one of those shows.

This is an ensemble drama with lots of different characters and storylines to follow.  As the series opens, ordinary humans begin to discover they have super powers.  There's Claire (Hayden Panettiere), a Texas cheerleader who can heal herself from any injury, even death.  In Los Angeles, cop Matt Parkman (Greg Grunberg) begins to hear the thoughts of everyone around him.  Niki Sanders (Ali Larter), Las Vegas stripper and single mom, has a Jekyll and Hyde like problem.  In Japan, cubical worker Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka) discovers he can stop time and teleport.  Convinced he has these powers for a reason, he sets out with his best friend Ando (James Kyson Lee) on a quest.

But things are really heating up in New York.  Senatorial candidate Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar) is trying to keep his ability to fly under wraps so he can win his election.  Meanwhile, his brother Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) seems to be able to absorb any power he is near.  And artist Isaac Mendez (Santiago Cabrera) can paint the future, but only when he is spaced out on drugs.  And his latest picture is of a nuclear bomb going off in New York City....

Even this description just begins to scratch the surface.  There are conspiracies aplenty and a villain that must be stopped at all cost.  Other characters come and go as well, adding to the show.

In fact, that's one thing that sets this show apart from others.  Not every main character is in every episode.  Only those needed appear.  And since most of the storylines run parallel for most of the series, just about every gets a break at some point.

Yet the show is surprisingly engrossing.  It took me a couple episodes to be fully hooked, but once I was, there was no looking back.  I had to tune in each week for the next chapter in the saga.

The show builds to a season climax that brings everyone together for a final battle.  Unfortunately, the season finale was very disappointing.  It was more confusing then it should have been and didn't tie up the things that they had been promising to do all season.  I don't mind most of the loose ends, but I expected the bomb storyline to be better concluded.

The show sports some great acting.  Everyone is perfect as their character.  The fan favorite, and with good reason, is Masi Oka.  He is an absolute delight as the lovable Hiro.

I watched the entire season (albeit rather painfully) and usually love these types of shows. I kept expecting something to happen and I kept getting dissapointed.

The acting was/is fair at best and the writing really failed to live up to even a small portion of the hype. I was dissapointed because I liked the pilot a lot and had high hopes for the show.

This blu-ray vs. HD DVD ""war"" crap is just too stupid. People write Amazon.com reviews for HD content like they have a personal/financial stake in either format. I can't figure out what the damn problem is.

I own a PS3 and an X-BOX 360 with the HD player attachment. I own a 42"" AKAI HD projection television that I LOVE! I own blu-ray movies and I own HD DVD movies. Folks... I can't tell one goddamn difference between the two formats. I mean... what the hell is the problem, people? My god, some of you out there are giving HEROES HD a 1 star rating because its on the HD DVD format. Come on people, don't be stupid. You all are getting caught up in a manipulation by BLOCKBUSTER and TARGET -- both huge companies report that they are only going to carry blu-ray. Other companies are continuing on with the HD DVD format. Sony owns blu-ray so of course they are pushing their product. Another huge movie studio just proclaimed that they will only use HD DVD.

The point of all this confusion is -- stop being children. I defy any one of you critical people out there to prove to me just how blu-ray is better than HD DVD. So far, I haven't seen either format really take advantage of all that extra space that some of you proclaim that blu-ray has more of than HD DVD. So damn what! From what I can see, it looks like the regular DVD versions of HEROES may actually have more content jammed into its guts than the HD versions.

Wake up, find your true compass, open your eyes and see the black for the white, and stop being stupid! If you love HEROES like I do you'll buy it in whatever format you can gets your paws on!

2836760,4,B000QDLSR0,"You know what it's about: a growing circle of everyday people begin to realize that they are not everyday people at all - that they have somehow acquired an array of super powers.  In Texas, a young cheerleader learns that she cannot die.  The brother of an ambitious politician has dreams of flight.  A beautiful woman learns that she has another identity, possessing super power and compelled by a murderous impulse.  In Japan, a young man learns that he has acquired the gift to bend time and space.  An artist in Manhattan is tortured by apocalyptic visions of the future.

These are just some of the inter-connecting stories that you'll see in Heroes.  Without writing too much (and turning this into the sort of review that belongs on a sci-fi blog), I'll just say that this is the perfect show.

Even if sci-fi is not your thing, ""Heroes"" excels in the ease with which it draws its individual characters, has them criss-cross its adventure-filled landscape, occasionally linking up in on-going story arcs but getting enough mileage dealing with their own personal problems in the finest tradition of TV character drama.  Along with shows like ""Lost"" and the new ""Galactica"", ""Heroes"" is great fodder for non-Scifi viewers who want everyday characters confronted with non-everyday circumstances.  Scripts keep the story going, playing with our sympathies as we begin to wonder which of these characters will really be heroic.  The strengths of the characters lie in what their powers can't do (a failed cop finds that his telepathy gets him into trouble; spontaneous regeneration may complicate a cheerleader's plans for homecoming).

The season is book-ended with visions of fiery catastrophe guaranteed to get anybody's attention.  If the climax does disappoint, the trip is more than enough to satisfy.  My personal peeve is the reliance on celebrity guest stars, though the leads are refreshingly unrecognizable.  With Eric Roberts as the sinister head...of some shadowy organization, Chris Eccleston doing a great spin on his former Doctor Who persona as an invisible man and nearly ageless George Takei as a Japanese tycoon.

2836769,1,B000QDLSR0,"I, along with some friends, was a faithful watcher of the show through the entire first season.  Whenever we missed an episode, we'd watch it at lunch the next day.  There are three things you need to know about the show before you think about buying the DVD: 1) there is a lot of vague, hazy, loose stuff in it, which I forgave all season long based upon the promise of, and an expectation of, a resounding finale; 2) the ""Save the Cheerleader, Save the World"" premise which was so heavily hyped never materializes at anywhere near the level which was promised (and you may notice that the ad campaign has disappeared) - although she is cute and shows some strength as an actress later in the show; and 3) the finale is so weak, and fails to deliver on so many levels, that my deferred irritation from the entire season has matured into full-blown disgust.

The strength of the initial premise suffered greatly from the improvisational nature of the writing.  This viewer, at least, has the strong suspicion that the writers didn't know from one week to the next whether they'd still be employed, so they just threw stuff together without any great attempt at coherency.  The overall effect of the show was gravely damaged by this lack. Regardless of any other concerns, there is an enormous amount of deliberate McGuffins, red herrings, vagueness, pointless characters, unused powers and futile actions and conversations.  Tim Kring apparently thinks he can string people along forever if he's just ambiguous enough about everything, therefore the episodes tend to be 60% or more fruitless frippery.

That's not to say Mr. Kring can't put together a good episode.  There was one episode in particular (""Five Years in the Future"") which was very good.  It really started to deliver on the promise which was shown in the early part of the series.  When Kring was creating multiple story arcs, creating and killing new Heroes all the time, and working up hideously overpowered Heroes who could absorb other Heroes' powers, however, the implicit promise was made that there would be a strong conclusion to these particular arcs - or some arcs.  Any arcs.  Instead, he stretches it all out, churns it along, and delays resolution so that they can write whatever they want next week or next month.  They throw in interesting characters, then slaughter them without mercy or remorse.  While it's possible that they may be brought back in some comic-book fashion (Remind me again why Hiro can't go stab Sylar in his crib?), it's more likely that Kring will just string everyone along as long as they give him more money.  I'm just not down with that plan.  Stand and deliver, Mr. Kring, if you want viewer's time and money.",1186358400,80,2717,4.798283261802575

2836772,5,B000QDLSR0,"Without hesitation, I give Heroes - Season 1 a 5-star rating.  If you have not yet seen this show, I would recommend going to the NBC website and watching the first episode on your computer.  Actually, all the episodes are available there for free.  However, watching on your computer and watching on your home television are two completely different things, especially if you have an HD compatible television.

For those of us with Blu-Ray players and PS3s, it is very unfortunate that it is only available in HD DVD format.  I would just like to briefly rebut a statement previously made that Blu-Ray uses old compression formats whereas HD DVD uses more advanced ones.  This is simply not true.  Both formats and players support the latest compression formats.  However, it is up to the studio producing the disc as to which compression they wish to put on the disc.  Essentially, there is no difference in Blu-Ray and HD DVD except that Blu-ray has slightly higher capacity and costs slightly more to produce.  Everything else is simply about which company gets your money.

Anyway, getting back to my original point, if you have an HD DVD player, you should buy this disc!  =)",1185840000,11,1181,4.792079207920792
2836773,5,B000QDLSR0,"I cannot emphasize enough that this is a stellar example of the power of character driven TV that follows a continuous plotline.  If you're looking for something that you can tune into and out of then this isn't the show for you.  If, however, you're looking for TV that is engaging, intriguing, and innovative then this is the show for you.

My preferred activity is normally reading and I don't watch much TV because, frankly, I find most TV subpar.  Imagine my delight when I tuned into this show mostly out of curiosity and ended the season a diehard fan.  I never missed an episode and looked forward to each new one with great anticipation.  I give most of the credit for this to where I feel the credit is due: the writing.  The writers for this show did a masterful job of creating an involving story arc and in giving the viewer just enough information to keep him or her coming back for more.  Answers to various questions were carefully dolled out over the course of the season so that the viewer never feels frustrated by too little story dragged out over too much time.  The pacing of this season was, in a word, perfect.

The other reason to devour this show is the characters and, in particular, the endearing and wonderful Hiro.  My favorite of the characters, Hiro exemplifies that childlike joy that some people possess when they discover they are particularly talented at something.  He provides comic relief without being too silly and his earnestness make him very lovable.  His faithful friend and sidekick Ando is certainly not to be overlooked either and these two make for a truly dynamic duo.  As far as complexity goes, my vote goes to Claire who starts out struggling with typical teenager desires and grows and develops over the course of the season until she is easily the most sympathetic character.

Excellent writing and excellent characters would mean little without the acting to back them up, though, and this show has that in abundance.  All of the actors imbue their characters with life and believability so that even though the bulk of them are possessed of superhuman powers they still seem like the kind of people who could be your nextdoor neighbors.

I simply can't say enough good things about this show.  I encourage everyone who enjoys really engaging, story and character driven, and thought-provoking television to watch this show.",1185321600,46,2380,4.777506112469438
2836774,2,B000QDLSR0,"I fortunately ignored the Heroes hype during the initial run but I found myself sitting through the marathon with someone and I thought I was going to bleed from my fat belly.  It was THAT painful staying in my seat to sit through this thing.  It's expensive, it's empty and there's no chemistry amongst the actors except when Hayden Panettiere is on screen.  It's just so boringk.  Oh, let me out of chere.",1185148800,8,407,4.534246575342466
2836775,3,B000QDLSR0,"I was so excited about this show when it was first advertised.  I love almost anything superhero related.  Unfortunately I was disappointed by the convoluted writing and over dramatic acting. The character backgrounds are SO cliche - the only thing unique about them is their super abilities which they all (except for Hiro and Sylar) hate about themselves and try to hide.  I mean, come on - have they never watched a sci-fi movie or read a comic book? You have super powers!  You've hit the jackpot! It was like watching a daytime soap opera shot on film.  These characters take themselves too seriously (I understand that they are all in a dire situations, but the only character with any sort of joy in his heart is Hiro - it's all just depressing.)  Everything they say is either totally emo or annoyingly philosophical.

The basic plot was fine, but I hated Mohinder Suresh's character like I've never hated any other character on TV and when Sendhil Ramamurthy and Nora Zehetner came on screen, their terrible acting powers combined to make probably the WORST scenes on prime time.  Overall, there are very few characters I actually like.  Hiro, Ando and Hiro's Dad are about it (and why do they have to speak in Japanese, but everyone in India speaks English?)  Everyone else drives me crazy.  Sylar may be one of the most obnoxiously played supervillans I've seen in a long time.  What a horrible season finale - no surprise that it was terrible, but what could have been a redeeming final episode just dropped the ball.

The episodes drag by so slowly.  One thing I will give them is that they do a good job with cliff hangers.  You sit and watch for 35 minutes and just when it finally starts to get a little bit interesting, they cut you off and you want to watch the next episode (which always starts off pretty good and then is mind numbingly dreary until the last 10 minutes.)

Let's face it, the real reason we're all watching is because we're waiting for it to turn into ""X-Men, The TV Series.""  (Sylar = Mr. Sinister; Claire = Wolverine, X-23; Issac= Destiny [she writes, he paints.. she writes in her diaries and the X-Men try to find those diaries to prevent the horrible predictions from becoming truth... sound familiar?];Hiro = Cable, Gateway, Magik; Peter= Mimic, Synch; Mohinder = Moira McTaggart; The Haitian = Leech; Candice = Mastermind; Claire's Mom = Pyro; Ted = Havok, Skullfire; Micah = Forge; Linderman = Elixir, etc.)

I keep watching and waiting and hating it, with a hope deep inside my heart that it will get better and that it will redeem itself and become a good plot AND character driven show and that the actors will eventually get better.  I must say - we received this set as a gift, and it's much easier to watch each episode back to back than it is otherwise.

I want to like this show so much, but they make it very hard.  The general framework it is built upon is classic and interesting - this show just falls short from greatness.",1185148800,13,2979,4.593572778827977
2836776,5,B000QDLSR0,"I have to admit, I wasn't too keen on this show when I first saw the ads for it. It looked a little bit too ""X-Men"" for me, and in the end, it is very, very similar. However, the show separates itself by focusing on the drama and humanity behind each character and not so much on their super powers (although there's a generous amount of that, too!). With the exception of 2 laughably bad episodes (episode 2 with its hokey dialogue and awkward first appearance by Greg Grunberg, and one towards the end which is slow and tedious and really just felt like filler until the season finale), it's an excellent show with high production values, great actors, and well-written characters and storylines. Even non-sci-fi types can get into the drama this show offers.

On a side note, I just wanted to mention to those of you ""holding out"" for a Blu-Ray release, that probably won't be happening anytime soon, if ever. The show is owned by Universal and Universal is exclusively supporting the HD DVD format and has recently expressed plans to continue doing so.

I have both a Blu-Ray player (through my PlayStation 3) and an HD DVD player (through my Xbox 360). While many of you with PS3's and standalone Blu-Ray players are understandably upset by this decision, it is inaccurate to think of Blu-Ray as the ""superior"" format just because it's selling more. When looking at the technical specs between Blu-Ray and HD DVD, HD DVDs actually use superior compression and encoding methods geared specifically for high definition content when transferring movies onto the disc, whereas Blu-Ray uses the same compression and encoding techniques used on standard definition DVDs. This means that movies released on both formats actually look better on HD DVD than their Blu-Ray counterparts. I've seen this for myself with numerous movies and the HD DVD versions consistently look (and sometimes sound) better.

That having been said, I'm happy this is coming to HD DVD instead of Blu-Ray. A great show like this deserves only the best quality presentation, and for videophiles like me, that quality can only be found on HD DVD.",1185062400,25,2118,4.861495844875346
2836777,5,B000QDLSR0,This is a very clever program it reminds me of a comic book story there are so many twists and turns and great heros that add to the excitement of this program so much better to watch on dvd than tv.,1184976000,3,199,3.8780487804878048
2836778,4,B000QDLSR0,"When I first heard about the show I thought it was going to be a corny ""super hero"" show. There have been many shows that have come on with the same type of premise, and they have been terrible. However, this one really sets the bar. There were some parts of the movie that seemed kind of dumb and a little repetitive, same stuff that has been in most of the ""gotta save the world"" movies and shows.  My main fear of what this show has done, is that Heros may have opened the door to many cheesy shows that are trying to do what they did.  But, thats a bit off the point.  The point is that this show rocks.  If you are a fan of action, sci-fi, and anything good, you need to watch this.  I know there are going to say that this show is for nerds or something stupid like that, but just watch one episode and I promise you'll get hooked.",1184889600,3,837,4.018072289156627
2836779,2,B000QDLSR0,"I was all about this show. I was head over heals in love with it. That is up until the last 4 episodes! Where they proceeded to cheat me and every other viewer out of a good ending to the season. It's like the writers woke up one day and just decided they had better stuff to do. Everything leading up to the last 4 episodes is simply amazing. But after putting in the time for 20 episodes, I expected the same creativity and ""wow-ness"" in the ending. It was a let down.

I won't be watching Heroes next season!",1184803200,13,511,4.11
2836780,5,B000QDLSR0,"What a great start for what I hope is a long running series. Great pacing, tightly plotted with enough reveals with conceals, a satisfyiing story arc / season finale. Great casting! Lots of fresh faces along with lots of familar ones.

The THEME: What if some everyday folks suddenly became superpowered in the ""real world?"" What if these people's origins, though seemingly random, were very much connected? And ""How do you stop a man from exploding (along with a bunch of NYC)?

If you didn't see it there's alot more to it than those questions. Lots of drama, some cool effects and plenty of humor too.

The 9th Wonders is a fictional comic that parallels the events of the characters in the series, partly because it's creator Isaac Mendez (SANTIAGO CABRERA)is an artist who can paint the future. This ability eventually joins these seemingly random group of heroes and villans together to resolve the fate of the city, and maybe, THE WORLD!

The series won plenty of respect from NBC along with award from the likes of the American Film Institute for Best TV Program of the Year, Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a Golden Globe (for Best TV Drama), the Peoples Choice, and others. In fact, the NAACP acknowledged the series for its efforts, and well it should, the cast is amazingly diverse in race and gender(but science-fiction and fantasy has always been ahead of the game there).

The archetypes roll out, but rarely take the obvious paths. Several character story threads are ultimately all entwined. Like that of Hiro Nakamura's lovable Japanese geek who can bend time & space (Masi Oka)and his powerless but loyal friend. Or Peter Petrelli (Milo Ventimiglia)the power-absorbing male nurse who may be the cause or the solution of the problems to be, and his flying politician brother (played by Adrian Pasdar or Top Gun & Profit). The brainy (but likable) Micah Sanders and his ""super"" disfuntional family, Niki, a mentally split super-assassin/super-stripper mom and the phazing ex-con dad. The invunerable Cheerleader Claire Bennet who's past and present has been puppetmastered by dark forces. The would-be police detective with mind-reading powers and young Dr. Suresh seeking not only to finish his father's work, finding these ""heroes,"" but stopping his father's killer. But who are the ""heroes"" and who are the villians? And what of the murderous watchmaker Sylar?

In typical soap fashion, even the ugly characters are interesting to look at. Eric Roberts, Malcom McDowell and Zachary Quinto appear as baddies in this charter season. Other cameos include George Takei as Hiro's father.

Watch for the 6 episode spinoff / filler series on NBC ""Heroes: Origins"" that will introduce a new superpowered character each week, viewers will select who makes it to the second season of Heroes.",1184371200,14,2806,5.0606060606060606

2836783,3,B000QDLSR0,"Heros is a strange series to  get into and it is best viewed as a series on DVD.  The first three episodes are hard to follow. The show tries to focus on all the major protagonists and antagonists at once.  Since you do not know who the heros and who the villians are this gets confusing.  After all the action tends to sputter in starts and stops all threw season one. You have to wait untill later on in the series until the stories start to come together.  Once this happens the show picks up its pace anad becomes much more streamlined. Until that happens you find yourself being frustrated by the bits and pieces the show gives you.

Unlike LOST or THE 4400, Heros has a hard time focusing on the major players and tries to show us too much without revealing anything.  The mystery and suspense of the story does not build smoothly.  It is almost as if the writter, director, and producer suffer from ADHD or ADA.  Instead of knitting the players together the show puts them on several different paths at once.  This would have worked wonderfully as a book but as a weekly t.v. series . . . Well like I said this is best viewed on DVD as a series.

As for the actors.  This is a cast that you have problems identifying with.  The main ""scientist"" character, an Indian professor, looks dirty and worn threw the entire season.  Unlike Said for say  Lost, this person has no charisma.  Without any screen presence you find yourself actually rooting for the bad guys to hurry up and kill him.  The same is true for several other characters with two notable exceptions.  The Japanese character and the American Cheerleader.  Both are well developed and have tapped into the zeitgeist of our sub culture.

Once again Heroes should have taken a lesson from Lost or Star Gate and used familliar actors (or battle tested actors and actresses) from other Sci-Fi shows.  By having a veteran Sci-Fi actor or actress, even as a cameo, the acting bar would have been raised and the cast would have been forced to develope faster.

We shall see how things devlope in season two but for now the show has a lot to overcome.  right now the show is a good show.  Deepending upon how the writters and director perform in season two will determine if the show becomes great.

Its really suprising to me because every single one of my friends love the show.  I tried really hard to watch the whole first season and I've ground to a halt at episode 16.

Things I Like:
-- The voiceovers by the indian professor - not the old one, the young one.  They are generally well written and give a decent vibe to each show.  He basically introduces and closes each show with a voice over.
-- The acting is fairly good for a run of the mill TV show
-- In particular - the acting of Claire and Hiro.  They are very likeable characters and it makes thier storylines very likeable.
-- the cheerleader and hero portions of the story.  They do the best job of stressing individuals discovering thier power and how they deal with it in the context of understanding thier life.

I disliked

-- the sheer number of different storylines they tried to meld together.  I felt that there were too many characters and in effect they tried to do entirely too much at once.  It caused what I think to be a major weakness which is the short choppy scenes.  As another reviewer mentioned you get about 1 to 2 minutes per scene before it jumps to someone else.  I think at least a couple characters could have been cut from the storyline and it would have made the show feel less frenetic.

--Predictability - in general you can see almost any turn of events coming way in advance either because of deliberate writing or the way the director films give you a bit of a hint of whats coming.  Mainly it seems to be the way the show is written.

-- I desperately didn't feel the need to include Ali Larter's family and Peter's brother.  It almost seemed like they were added to give more drama to the show, but really I just kept wanting to fast forward through thier parts because I found thier characters grating and dull.  While I see how they enter into the story, I also can see Heroes without them in it.

-- The are at times, and I know this is a generalization, where it felt like they forced Lost to have  sex with X-Men and this show was the result.  It was almost like Lost with people with special abilities.  I admit I like Lost, and I like X-Men, and I even liked parts of Heroes....

End result..I didn't like Heroes and thought it could have been a lot better.  I figured I would share my opinion so others could see a review that didn't just state ""I hate it"" without reasons.",1183334400,41,2576,4.316666666666666
2836788,5,B000QDLSR0,"What got me hooked on this show was the character Hiro. He is probably one of the most powerful but he hasn't quite figured out everything he can do. The place they leave us off with makes ya think hes gonna get even cooler :) travel through space and time or just stop time. lol. And his acting is awesome.

Peter has nothing in the beginning he just wants to help people. He eventually starts figuring out what he can do. I don't wanna say much more though or it'll spoil it.

I guess this show has something for everyone. Those are my two favorite characters and They keep me interested in the show. I epically wanna see Hiro and Peter kick some more butt.

2836789,1,B000QDLSR0,"Heroes is entertaining and does hold your attention at times. It is not very original and I am sad to say,it will make any attempt by J. Michael Straczynski of ""Babylon 5"" fame to bring ""Rising Stars"" to the screen and be compared as a knockoff.
""American Idol"" and ""Lost"" are considered giant hits, followed by millions, explains the massive appeal of this show.
The show bounces around constantly giving each type of viewer something to identify with and most waiting expectantly to see what happens in the next episode. The finale was a weak attempt to bring a conclusion to this season, and may be an indication of how weak this series will be in the long run as the writers run out of ideas and try to copy other successful cliche' that will be touted as original ideas.
I will probably buy this for the extras. When the price drops to around $10.00 or I find a quality bootleg copy.",1182816000,15,888,4.487654320987654

2836791,5,B000QDLSR0,"I hate television.  I never, ever watch tv.  But I saw a preview for this show over the summer of 2006 while in a movie theatre.  It totally caught my eye, and I decided to actually be home the day it came on and watched it - must have been the commercial-free pilot episode.  It sucked me in.  Maybe it was the fact that they cast a stunningly handsome Milo Ventimiglia as the empathic mimicrist Peter Petrelli - or the goofy and lovable Masi Oka as the time-travelling Japanese businessman with complete faith in saving the world?  Not sure, but the brilliant writing hooked me.

Granted, there were moments throughout the season where some of the actors' lackluster acting skills had me groaning through some scenes, but it all melded together beautifully.  The writing, each and every word, came together for some reason.  Not a single thing in this series is put there for chance.  EVERYTHING MEANS SOMETHING.  And I love that they don't leave you dangling and wanting to hang yourself - the writers totally answer your questions (but also leave you asking several more....)

Sure... we all wanted to see more action with Sylar vs. Peter - but let's not forget... these are 'Ordinary People with Extraordinary Powers'.... you try dealing with this stuff in your life  ;)

I don't understand why anyone would not like this show.  As someone who has not enjoyed television for a long time, I can certainly say this series has been a breath of MUCH NEEDED fresh air.  Definitely something for everyone - an intelligent, brilliant, edge-of-your-seat show that keeps you satisfied, yet wanting more after every show.",1182729600,12,1616,4.800724637681159

Who knew it would be a TV show that gives us everyday people with everyday problems, who just happen to discover that they have extraordinary powers and abilities.

What makes HEROES unique is the human element, the fact that the story itself is treated not as  a ""what if"" senario based in real situations, but as a ""This  could really be happening"" situation. The show is character driven and wonderfully written as well.
 Stan Lee says that when he created Spider-man people could relate because he was the most accessable and believable of all the other comic book characters and because he was more human and vulnerable.
I think that's why HEROES works so well it takes everyday people and places them in the these comic book like scenarios. This show is about love,loss and in the end hope. The kind of hope that this world is missing now, and that's why the world embraced HEROES, because inside of us we all wish that we could SAVE THE CHEERLEADER, SAVE THE WORLD and for an hour each night we did",1182211200,11,1187,4.406392694063927

2836800,5,B000QDLSR0,"The first time I heard about this show, I rolled my eyes. After all, it was by no means original. Every character (with the possible exception of Nikki/ Jessica) was already done by X-Men. Claire (Wolverine's healing), DL (Kitty Pryde), Peter (Mimic), Nathan (at least 5 characters)... I probably only watched it so I could see how it compared to X-Men. And then, I was hooked.

There is plenty of action to go around in the season. What had me just as hooked was the characters. They were by no means shallow. They had to deal with real problems - cheating spouse, living up to his parent's standards, fear of what parents would say if they knew who they really were... While some of them had deeper stories and personalities than others, I loved how the good vs. evil line remained blurred. For example: Was Bennet (Claire's dad), perceived as evil in the first few episodes, really bad? On the other hand, the ""bad"" guy felt guilty at the loss of innocent human lives. It was not a simple ""we're good, you're evil, let's fight, good wins"" type of show.

Fans of the X-Men will not be disappointed in this show. Any sci-fi fans, not to mention action/ drama fans will absolutely love it. It is definitely a must-see. I can't wait to see all the extras myself.",1180742400,17,1261,4.526315789473684
2836801,5,B000QDLSR0,"Heroes was without a single doubt the single best new show of this television season. While shows like 24 and Lost had disapointing seasons, Heroes just shined from start to finish. This wasn't just my favorit show of this seson but it was honestly one of the best first seasons to a TV show I have ever seen right along side Lost season 1. I wouldnt hesitate for a second on picking this up. The fact that it is coming to HD DVD is just a huge huge bonus as this is without a single doubt the type of TV show made for HD. Everything from the subject matter to the look of the show fit HD like a glove. The fact that it has bonus features like the entire unaired 73 minute pilot episode is just another reason that this set will be a must buy for people. Honestly having the unaired pilot to a show that ultimatly ended up becoming this successful and this popular really makes this one of the best extras every included in a televison show both for HD and SD.

As for the people saying they are going to wait for the better BD release I can only laugh at such optimism. First off BD is not better than HD DVD and I know first hand as I have both formats and second Universal is exclusive to HD DVD and there is literally zero evidence that they will ever release on BD. act is they have a contract with HD DVD that runs until the end ofthis year and I fully expect them to renew that contract as they would be really stupid not too. So keep on hoping and waiting for your season 1 of Heroes on BD and in the mean time us HD DVD owners will be content to actually watch our copies. Its time to just start facing the facts and the facts are this war is practically in a dead heat and both of these formats are going to be around for years to come. Universal is on HD DVD's side and if you really think Toshiba and Microsoft aren't willing to pay them every single penny that they require to keep things that way then your living in la la land. Same can be said for BD and Disney. It won't be until these formats are so popular that these studios literally start losing hundreds of millions of dollars by not supporting the other side that they will even begin to look at that option.

If your a Universal nut like me and if yur a Heroes nut like me, do yourself a favor and pick up the far less expenisive HD DVD and start enjoying it now instead of hoping that in a year or two that there might be a chance for this set coming out on BD. Why pay hundreds of dollars more on lesser quality players to have to sit back and wait?

Very few scenes last longer than a minute or two, so a charitable reviewer might say the story was ""fast paced.""  To me, it's just aimless.  Particularly ironic is that the story plods along at a snail's pace despite the obvious attempt to forcibly induce excitement with a frantic tempo.

I enjoy ""light and fluffy"" TV as much as your average viewer.  One thing that tends to irk me, however, is when a show takes itself very seriously, but can't hold up to even modest scrutiny.  Indeed, Heroes takes itself very, very seriously, yet the plot is rife with holes (more than it takes to fill the Albert Hall, no doubt), and is advanced solely by one ridiculous contrivance after another.

I realize this sort of TV appeals to the Ritalin doped Lost crowd that needs a loud noise and a scene change every few minutes to keep its attention, but Heroes offers very little in the way of entertainment for more thoughtful viewers.",1180656000,47,1101,4.824468085106383

With all that said, Heroes really delivered in it's freshmen season.  It gave us interesting characters, fantastic powers, the right amount of humor, and the looming doom of catastrophe, all in a neat package.

Of course the show has it's critics, and I will agree that not every episode is hit out of the park, but they are all good in their own way.  People have said that the stories and powers are unoriginal, taking things from Watchmen and X-Men, and all I can say to that is many movies and TV shows draw from other material and at least here they pay homage to great works of the past and use it interesting ways.

2836813,5,B000QDLSR0,"Perhaps one of the most ambitious undertakings in modern television history.  NBC took some serious risks this season with a number of innovative and groundbreaking shows.  No gamble, however, could have been more unlikely a success story than was their pilot for ""Heroes.""

Because of its comic book, episodic nature, Heroes might have fared better starting off as a miniseries or ""event"" playing two episodes several nights in a row to get its audience past an unusually long introductory period where an audience is still trying to identify numerous characters over a not-very-clear plot line.  Nonetheless, those who stuck with it were rewarded with one of the most satisfying network series debuts since the ""24.""

The ""Heroes"" include a shapeshifter, a Japanese worker who has mastered moving through the time space continuum, a cheerleader who can recover from any injury - including death, a mindreading cop, an invisible man, a dual-personality stripper with the ultimate good/evil split, a man who can walk through solid objects, a child who communicates with machines, a heroin addicted artist whose paints the future of the world, a politician with the ability to fly and his younger brother who absorbs the powers of every other hero.  There are more to explore and each adds unexpected nuance and richness - as well as endless possibilities - to the story.

All of these people have been tracked down during a lifelong study by a professor from India forced to abandon his family and move to New York for the final part of his research:  contact.  When he's mysteriously killed, his estranged and embittered son, through a series of intense epiphanies, bedraggedly becomes involved in discovering who these extraordinary people are and the reason for their existence.

With more plot twists, turns and confusion than a night at the Chinese Opera, ""Heroes"" manages a balancing act of ancient grand guignal theatre, action/adventure, combined with all in an epic both .  In the best ""bad guy"" tradition, ""Heroes"" offers up villains that, on the surface, seem little more than scenery chewing cardboard cartoon characters - but ah, get to know them, and they are multi-faceted,

The very best entertainments draw you into another world, are able to create a feeling that engages your imagination and, even in their darkness, beckons the viewer to stay and explore.  I do not know any show that has done this better than have the creators of ""Heroes.""

What is most remarkable about this large cast of characters is their very ordinariness.  In the very best superhero tradition, each lives an ordinary, mundane existence and when confronted with their extraordinary abilities, must figure out a balancing act to incorporate these abilities into a normal existence.  This, of course, ultimately proves impossible and the deeper reasons for why they are they way they are emerge, eventually bringing all together to prevent - or cause - a catastrophic event that will destroy or save the world.

While the entire ensemble of actors provide uniformly satisfying performances, there are, several standout performances:  Masi Oka, as the unlikely ""Hiro"" - our endearing time traveler who (literally) comes straight from the pages of a comic book learning, ungracefully, how to bend time and space to accomplish his mission.  Hayden Panettiere as ""Claire"" the indescructable cheerleader who, despite her amazing abilities must be ""saved""; Milo Ventimiglia as ""Peter"" - the confused, soft spoken nurse to whom is given the great task:  ""Save the cheerleader, save the world.""  Then there is Zachary Quinto as ""Sylar"" the darkly handsome brainsucker and ultimate boogeyman.  But again, trust me, singling out these particular heroes in no way diminishes the potency and brilliance of the rest of the cast - all integral to the telling of this most amazing tale.

""Heroes"" debut season ended - quite literally - with a bang, and even just a peak into next season makes me hungry for more.  Lots more!",1180051200,19,4002,5.1121351766513055

The Actors in the show are terrific, and really put their all into these roles. I loved the cast as it showed many actors from other shows and movies that I enjoyed watching. And best of all, it is about Superheroes and the villains they must face. The super powers each person possesses works well with their individual identities.

2836815,5,B000QDLSR0,"Looks like somebody took the whole superhero craze we have been getting over the past few years and came up with a truly innovative and compelling television series. Heroes isn't your standard comic book fan's television show. This is some serious writing with drama, depth and yeah... some fun and action as well.

What makes this show so great is the large cast of characters who all seem to have significance in the story. Even better is that all of these characters come from different backgrounds and approach life in different ways, but at the same time there is something special about them. Everybody has that fantasy of being special and this show has at least one character in it you can identify with.

The writing is almost pitch perfect with every episode giving you something to get excited about. The show is done in serial format so what happens in one episode resonates throughout the series, and Heroes takes it to a grand level. Sometimes you get a great cliffhanger styled ending and sometimes you just a cool revelation. Either way each ep is sure to please. That's especially for the last episode of the season, which answers a lot of questions, keeps the lesser questions still hanging, asks even more questions, and ties up the major loose ends nicely. So nicely that even if the show never made to the second season you would have a well-rounded story from beginning to end.

Now for the DVD. If you are going to do it this is the way to go! This DVD is packed. Here's what you get:

- An extended version of the pilot episode. 73 minutes long according to my sources. That's an extra 30 minutes AND includes footage of a never before seen character! Well... people saw it at the San Diego ComicCon last year, but that's besides the point.

- 50 (that's right... 50!!!) deleted and extended scenes.

- Making of Heroes featurette as well as specials on the stunts, special effects, and music score.

- Special profile of Tim Sale: the artist who does Isacc Mendez' paintings.

- A mind reading mini-game (don't ask me... that's what I heard).

This is going to be a killer DVD set. I also heard Heroes season 1 will come out on HD DVD. The buzz is they will include special features exclusive to the HD version in addition to all of the features already on the DVD. So if you have an HD-DVD player you will probably want to forego the regular release and get the HD version.

Anyway if you like the show you will love the DVD (or HD DVD if that's your thing). Doesn't matter if you're a comic book fan, sci-fi/fantasy fan, or whatever. If you like good stories in the serial format this show is it.",1179964800,22,2623,4.514767932489452

It opens with Mohinder Suresh (Sendhil Ramamurthy) reflecting on the human quest for knowledge -- even knowledge that we shouldn't have -- right before learning that his father has been killed, possibly murdered. Suresh's dad believed that ""special"" people were cropping up, much like in X-Men.

And we are introduced to the ""heroes"": stripper Niki (Ali Larter) harbors a secret dark side, cheerleader Claire (Hayden Panettiere) heals from any injury, Japanese Dilbert Hiro (Masi Oka) can bend time and space, Senatorial candidate Nathan (Adrian Pasdar) is able to fly, his brother Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) can copy others' powers, a cop Matt (Greg Grunberg) can read minds, and junkie artist Isaac (Santiago Cabrera) sees the future. There are plenty of others that show up, but these start the ball rolling.

While Claire and Hiro explore the potential of their new powers, Niki and her son try to elude some hired thugs --and end up overwhelmed by her dark side, and framed. And Suresh searches for the answer to his father's death, only to find that his genetics research is involved with the ""special people,"" and that a superpowered serial killer is targeting them.

Even worse, Hiro takes a trip to New York (five weeks in the future), and sees the city destroyed by a massive blast -- as does Isaac, through his paintings. How to stop it? As a future Hiro tells them, ""save the cheerleader, save the world."" The Heroes begin slowly coming into contact, in a haze of dreams, visions, murder, swords and death -- and to stop the serial killer and save New York, more sacrifices may be made...

Unlike most shows about people with superpowers, ""Heroes"" isn't really about the action or flashy battles. It's half epic save-the-world-as-a-team story, and half exploration of how real, ordinary people would react if they suddenly found out that they had superpowers, and how this would change -- or NOT change -- their lives.

The storylines are incredibly intricate and complex, since there are a dozen subplots and a lot of time travel, and plenty of hints at future events. The careful painting of all these storylines even further in two episodes, one of which shows the pre-Heroic lies of the characters (and how Syler became a murderous terror), and another that shows what the future will be like if they don't change it. It's not a pretty picture.

These complex storylines are enhanced by lots of suspense and tightly directed action, and the makers always know how to throw in a shocking twist, such as a sword-carrying future Hiro showing up.. But there is also some poignancy, and very dark humor from time to time (Claire waking up in mid-autopsy, or twisting her broken neck around). Not to mention some great, sometimes geeky dialogue (""Where did you learn all this?"" ""X-men No. 143 when Kitty Pryde time travels!"").

The actors are pretty much all good -- Larter gives a great double performance, Zachary Quinto is a wonderfully twisted villain, and Panettiere gives a good performance as a teen whose adolescence has a lot more than hormones in store. Masi Oka is the standout, though -- his Hiro is sweet, endearing, geeky, heroic, sad, kindly, funny and thoroughly lovable. The scene where he arrives in New York is adorable.

The ""Heroes"" are only starting their journey, and the first season of this geeky hit is a must-see for fans of intelligent sci-fi drama. And I doubt their journey is over...",1179878400,64,3899,4.938931297709924
2836817,5,B000QDLSR0,"When I first started watching Heroes, I thought it was going to be another mind numbing television show. I sat there expecting the worse, and I was pleasantly surprised over what I saw. For the first time I became excited over a television show. With most shows I would like a few episodes, but could not stand the watch the whole series. With Heroes it was totally different. This acting is brilliant, the writing and directing is superb. When I saw that it was renewed for the fall I actually applauded. I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who likes live comic book type action. I will be buying my copy of Heroes when it is released.",1179878400,6,649,4.508474576271187
2836818,5,B000QDLSR0,"Alright. I know everybody's jumping on the bandwagon saying how great Heroes is...they're right. There are not alot of good shows out there but this is one of few. The first episode seemed promising, but the following episodes made me think this show would turn into another ""Smallville"" (too much sope-opera 'I luv Lana' nonsense; little to no good action and drama scenes). Anyway, The season has its slow episodes mind you but as they begin to introduce all these super-powered guys and character development gets a goin' it really moves from 3-star to 5-star quality and by the end you definately want more. Maybe not a must have for me but it definately had me hooked.",1179878400,5,673,4.760683760683761
2836819,5,B000QDLSR0,"Since everyone else gave the plot-synopsis reviews and the long posts on why this show is great, I'll try my best not to. :D

When my parents first saw the preview for the pilot episode (about a week before it stared), they called both my brother and me down to tell us about it.  A week later, we sat down for the first episode, and, needless to say, our whole family was hooked.  Incredible story-line, incredible premise... it just looked like a good show.  And we watched the rest of the season just as readily, and were rarely disappointed.  There were only two things, in fact, that really disappointed us:

1.  WAY too many commercials, especially at the beginning.  At first, it seemed like they had a half-hour show, couldn't think of anymore, and used commercials to drag it out to an hour.  That got a lot better throughout the season, but it happened again in the last episode, ""How to Stop and Exploding Man"" (GO NATHAN! But we'll miss you.), and got really bad.  Just need to write more show and air less commercials, IMO.

2. The previews for upcoming shows got really annoying with the ""this next show is absolutely the biggest, because it has everything you've been waiting for, and to miss it would be the biggest mistake of your life"" hook (okay, they didn't use those words, but that is essentially what they said).  Every show was previewed as the most important show IN THE WORLD.  Granted, I know they wanted to build anticipation, but they overdid it just a tad.

So, in other words, there was nothing really disappointing about the series itself so far, and I can't wait for Volume 2 (which started in ""How to Stop an Exploding Man."")  Whoever wrote the idea for this is brilliant.  Thank you.",1179878400,4,1718,4.565359477124183
2836820,5,B000QDLSR0,"Heroes is the best show I have ever seen on TV the storytelling is amazing the special effects are awesome and overall the show is just brilliant, I recommend this HD DVD set to anyone who is a fan of the show or even if you have never seen it before I guarantee you'll love it.",1179878400,17,278,3.982142857142857
2836821,5,B000QDLSR0,"It took this long to get the Alan Moore/Dave Gibbons classic to the screen, albeit the small screen.  Wait, this isn't the ""Watchmen?""  Its not, but its a cunning, wholesale rip off of the classic beloved graphic novel.  And yet, ""Heroes"" is almost as thrilling as the comic it rips off.  The show starts off a bit slow, but after the third or fourth episode, it really takes off.  The characters are interesting.  The plotline is mostly, but not always, fun.  I am looking forward to revisiting this on DVD so I don't have to sit through all of the commercials the show comes saddled with on a weekly basis.  Also lacking will be the overly long break between the final set of episodes.  I highly recommend ""Heroes,"" but please, check out the masterful and endlessly engaging graphic novel ""Watchmen"" by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons.",1179792000,3,833,4.6506849315068495
2836822,5,B000QDLSR0,"I'm not a big TV watcher, and I certainly don't get into many shows where I'm eagerly anticipating what is coming next.  However, Heroes has proven to be an exception - and not just for myself, but for millions around the world.  I saw the season finale last night and, while it wasn't all that I had hoped for (a little bit too sappy for my taste - I was hoping for a lot more of a climatic final battle scene), it was still a series well worth watching.  I'm not sure at the moment whether or not this is a TV show that I'd want to own on DVD or not, as it is much like 24 where once you've seen the episode, I'm not sure how much you'd get out of it on reruns, except if you are in the middle of the season or something (which is why I bought the iTunes Season Pass).  I understand with most comedies and single-episode dramas (Law and Order, CSI, etc.) that you would want to see them multiple times - I'm just not sure about Heroes, however.  Regardless, I'm sure there will be plenty of buyers to make this a hit on DVD - especially once ""Volume Two"" (Season Two) starts up in the Fall.",1179792000,5,1092,4.06046511627907

2836824,5,B000QDLSR0,"Warning!  Multiple Spoilers below!

By any standard 2006-2007 was an exceptionally good season for television, with a host of very good new series being introduced.  In fact, there was something of a battle for the survival of the fittest taking place, with more new serial dramas than viewers were able to support.  Shows with considerable potential like SIX DEGREES and THE NINE simply did not have a chance to develop given the amazing range of competition.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, UGLY BETTY, MEN IN TREES, DEXTER, and, of course, HEROES were some of the ones that managed to survive.

HEROES was one of the more hotly debated shows on the Internet this year.  Few doubted that it was good; the question was how good.  Was it a masterpiece, potentially one of the great series ever, or was somewhat overrated, given more credit for excellence than it deserved?  Much of the debate centered on HEROES versus LOST.  I'm not quite sure why these two particular shows were paired in the debate, as if the excellence of the one somehow hinged on the excellence, or lack thereof, of the other.  Personally, I'm no great prophet, but I'm willing to take a few stabs on the relative merits of HEROES.  I loved the show, didn't miss a single episode, and looked forward to seeing it each week.  But it never hit me as a truly great affair.  If I compare it with the best supernatural/Sci-fi shows of the past decades (the audience to which the show mainly catered), it didn't, in my estimation, come up to the complexity or sophistication of BUFFY, ANGEL, ALIAS, LOST, or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  For instance, I just read of a call for papers for one-day academic conference in England on BATTLESTAR.  The show is so rich and complex that I can imagine dozens and dozens of potential topics for academics to discuss.  But I can't imagine this with HEROES.  It simply lacks the kind of depth you find in the other shows (though I suspect LOST's depth will be end-of-series depth, if it turns out to possess it--most of LOST's academic interest lies in its narrative techniques).  HEROES is enormous fun, but I get the sense that each week any viewer is able to absorb and process all of the information that he or she is given.  One may be left with a few questions, but they are not terribly difficult questions.  And I never found myself engaged in the kinds of online debates that I have had with BUFFY or BATTLESTAR.  Part of the reason is certainly due to the fact that HEROES is focused more on plot than on character.  BATTLESTAR, for instance, is always primarily about things that are taking place beneath the surface of the show.  With HEROES, it is mainly about what is on the surface.  In short, HEROES simply lacks a lot of the depth of the best genre shows.

I read one really good description of HEROES:  BUFFY seemed to be a show produced by a great TV writer who loved comic books, while HEROES seems to be a show produced by a great comic book writer who loved TV.  I think there is some merit to that.  (For the record, I'm primarily a lover of great TV who also enjoys comics and graphic novels, and I have a couple of large bookshelves dedicated to holding various graphic novels.)

The more curious debate that I've seen on the Internet was the First Half of the Season versus the Second Half of the Season.  This mystifies me because to me it seems clear that the second half of the season was far superior to the first half.  This is an important question because the vast majority of really good shows--and I very much want to believe that HEROES has the potential to be a very good show--tend to get better as they go along.  The best new show of the 2006-2007 season was unquestionably FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (and I'm sure the few hundred people who saw it will agree with me--how can a show be so good and get so few viewers?).  And there is absolutely no question that it got better and better and better as it went along.  For me I saw HEROES as being good and fun for about the first two-thirds of the season and then near great for the final third (I'll leave aside the somewhat disappointing finale for a second).  I know the particular episode where everything kicked into a higher gear:  ""Company Man,"" in which we learn in considerable detail the nature of Mr. Bennet's job and how he became Claire's adoptive father.  For me, a series is as interesting as the characters on the show are complex and this was the first episode where any of the characters became complex as opposed to perplexing.  The rest of the season increased the complexity and the depth of the characters.  Earlier it wasn't clear that the writers grasped a simple truth:  a show about someone who can fly or become invisible or who is indestructible is not interesting; what is interesting is how a person responds to that.  But the latter part of the season did seem to ""get"" that.

One reason I think that Season Two has a chance to be a lot more interesting than Season One is that in Season One you sometimes had a large ensemble cast that sometimes did little or not interaction.  Many of the main characters did not meet until the season finale (I actually would have loved to see how Peter, whose ability is to absorb the abilities of other ""heroes,"" would have reacted to being around Ali Larter's character, whose ability is a super empowered alter ego).  The various characters were simply spread about with little or no connections to one another.  But Season Two could see a much more coordinated cast.

Since my review is either the first or second review written after the season finale (I refuse to write a review of any series that I have not seen completely and I really wish Amazon would make it impossible to review any season of a show before the finale has been broadcast), I thought I would say something about that.  After a season-long build up to the finale, in which there would simultaneously be a confrontation with Sylar and an attempt to prevent the nuclear destruction of New York City, the final battle was a bit of a let down.  Not only was the final resolution a bit unimaginative, there was little originality or complexity.  There was very little to mark it off as special.  Moreover, it is not even clear that in the final ""battle"" anyone even died.  All that happens is Peter and Sylar meet, Hiro delivers an apparently fatal blow to Sylar, Peter goes nuclear, Claire is about to shoot him, and Nathan intervenes by snatching him and flying off into the stratosphere before he explodes.  But irritatingly, Sylar turns out not to have died but crawled off into the sewer, and I'm betting that Nathan flew off before Peter exploded.  And Peter, of course, will rejuvenate after exploding.  One of the lessons that BUFFY taught us was that good series have body counts.  A number of characters did die over the course of the season on HEROES, but having the possibility that no one died in the finale lessened the cost of the ""victory.""  I did like the brief beginning of ""Chapter Two"" following the resolution of the nuclear incident.  Hiro finds himself catapulted somehow to 17th century Japan confronted by a larger group of archers.  A single horseman is on a distant hill, with a banner containing the symbol that is placed on the shoulder of several of the ""heroes"" in Season One, a horseman who seemed to bear a sharp resemblance to Hiro's father (played by George Takei).  So while the finale was a bit of a disappointment, this definitely pointed towards interesting things ahead.  So also did the revelation by Molly, the little girl with the ability to locate anyone by merely thinking about them, that there was someone who was far worse than Sylar.  I'm sure we'll be meeting this person in Season One.

I liked the cast as a whole.  I was even bothered less by Milo Ventimiglia, who I had always intensely disliked in his days on THE GILMORE GIRLS.  Hayden Panettiere was adorable as the indestructible cheerleader (though there was a brief controversy early in the season when her gay best friend was suddenly de-gayed inexplicably, almost certainly as the result of network pressure in response to small but passionate anti-gay groups) and it was great to see a high school-aged character being played by someone actually that age.  Masi Oka quickly became a fan favorite as Hiro, the young Japanese would-be hero who somehow aspired to being able to overcome the space-time continuum, and surprisingly managed to do precisely that.  Ali Larter was wonderful as Niki/Jessica, the schizoid and incredibly dangerous beauty who struggled all season with reconciling her two natures.  Sendhil Ramamurthy was a fascinating presence as Mohinder, an Indian geneticist struggling to understand the genetic permutations that allowed some individuals to develop unusual abilities.  There were many others as well, in addition to many excellent guest appearances (though a shout out to Christopher Eccleston, the former DR. WHO star who teaches Peter how to control his powers).  My favorite character was, however, Jack Coleman as Mr. Bennet, who is easily the most complex character on the show.  Early on we suspect that he might be an utterly sinister individual; only gradually do we discover his actual agenda and aims.

All in all, this was an amazingly entertaining show.  I find that different shows I watch meet different needs.  I watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA for its depth and stunning originality and I love to debate the tiniest detail with other fans.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS I watch for the way it plunges so deeply into the emotional lives of its characters (it really isn't' about football).  LOST I watch for the ongoing complexity of its rich and wonderful story (after recovering from a string of weak early Season Three episodes).  But other shows I just turn off my brain and have fun.  UGLY BETTY was one of these and HEROES another.  I found it to be infectious and uncomplex fun.  And yeah, it really was the onscreen equivalent of a really good comic book.",1179792000,163,10016,4.681532304173814

I don't know the entire Clark Kent family tree, or the name of Peter Parkers dog. I didn't stand in line to watch Batman begins nor do I analyze the casting decisions of certain onscreen versions of favorite heroes. But I enjoy the concept of superpowers. It's a secret passion to imagine the possibilities of being telepathic, self healing, super-strength and teleportation. that is why this show is popular. It isn't just for the techno geeks, or the comic book crowd. It isn't exclusive, it's accessible and it appeals to our secret wish to be unique.",1179705600,6,667,4.661016949152542

That being said, I do not plan to review all the stuff that's already been reviewed ad nausium.  Instead I want to offer a brief thought.  There is so little humor in this show that, at times, it sinks to soap opera levels.  There's a good reason why Hiro is probably the most popular character.  He at least shows some excitement and seems to be having fun with his new powers.  The sense of IMPORTANCE is so over sold that it ruins a lot of it.  The last few episodes, leading up to the first season finale have been intense but SOOOOO dark.  I like the political subplot but the vegas, Linderman subplot seemed a waste.  However, it was the best thing on TV this year (that's not saying much). I can't help but wonder; what would Joss Wheaton have done with this?",1179705600,7,852,4.275
2836827,5,B000QDLSR0,"For those of us who grew up on comics books, this is a show for which we have longed. Why is it that when superheroes are adapted to television or movies, they always seem to become these cheese-filled farces that rely on camp and special effects? THAT is not what attracts us ""fanboys"" to the genre. It was never about tights and flights so much as the drama and tension between the characters. Like sci-fi soap operas - the punching and super-powers were just extras!

And this...THIS is a show that takes the genre seriously. Even my wife, who would rather watch the History channel than any other, will watch the show with me and engage in serious speculative commentary. In other words, even SHE likes it! I can think of no higher compliment.

I have to mention, my first book, ""Saban and the Ancient"" has been compared to Heroes a lot, lol, hence the joking title of the review. There is talk of adapting it to small or big screen, but with Heroes already out there, it's going to have some mighty big shoes to fill - for which I am grateful. It's nice to see that this show has RAISED the bar. I would get the DVD in a heartbeat, and in fact, already have it on pre-order.

You should too, even if you have never liked comic-booky stuff. It's about the people, not the powers. It's about the tough choices that make some people heroes. Not superheroes. Just heroes.",1179705600,9,1372,4.436507936507937
