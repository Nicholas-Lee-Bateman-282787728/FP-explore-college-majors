8379933,5,B002T6V174,Very enjoyable movie.  It is truly inspiring to see people who are making a difference in their community by raising abandoned boys in villages where the parents lives have been taken over by drugs.  I actually saw this movie in full length on YouTube and I wish that the video version and the one that follows it if it were available.  May GOD Bless people in this world who are willing to put aside selfish pursuits to help others in need.,1435536000,,441,4.419753086419753
8379934,5,B002T6V174,"Most likely to appeal to people who have traveled in the region--and by travel, I mean gotten way off any kind of beaten path on one's own---and/or individuals inclined towards the study of Theravada Buddhism, Thai sociology, etc.  Not for folks with attention deficit disorder or for anyone whose idea of travel is being herded about in a pack.",1302652800,,345,4.8474576271186445
8379935,5,B002T6V174,"This is one of the best documentaries on Buddhism and orphanages I have ever seen. I saw it at a film festival when it first came out a few years and have wanted to see it again. It is almost impossible to find, but finally coming out mainstream. Wonderful story and incredible cinematography.
I saved up for a long time, and have watched it about 5 times since I got it two weeks ago. Definitely worth the investment.",1295827200,,418,4.371794871794871
8379936,5,B002T6V174,"We, 3 Thai Buddhist monks and 1 American monk watched this film together along with some Anglo friends from teen-age up. We all enjoyed the film. It is powerful and real. The Golden Triangle is a dangerous place and this monk's work is fascinating. Much better film than we expected.",1292716800,,283,4.68
8379937,5,B002T6V174,"In my line of working with others, this glimpse of life -far from us- instills the fact that there are wonderful, useful, human beings, throughout the world, endeavoring to make change. It is an inspiration that no matter what the economy- action, gratitude and the will to be a part of life can make a difference. Or as Sadhguru Vasudev says: ""You can live life on the surface- or find deeper meaning.""",1289692800,,403,4.611111111111111
8379938,5,B002T6V174,I read about this video in Tricycle and immediately was interested in it as I have lived in Thailand for a while. It is so refreshing to see something different like this about Buddhism. Well worth buying!,1270080000,6,205,4.5675675675675675
8379939,5,B002T6V174,I loved Buddha's Lost Children! I first saw it at the Sedona International Film Festival and was blown away on how well it was done and the amazing story that the filmmakers captured. Such a good story of transcending darkness into a peaceful warrior. I would love to see other films ny these filmmakers!,1266105600,7,304,4.648148148148148
8379940,5,B002T6V174,"It's refreshing to see a documentary where the film maker stays out of the way - the opposite of Michael Moore - and lets the subjects tell their own stories by letting us into their lives. The cinematography is excellent along with the editing, writing, score and - most importantly - the subjects are fascinating. It is impossible not to be moved by these children's lives and share in their suffering and happiness along their life's journey. Luong Por Khru Bah is not your usual Thai Buddhist monk as you will see. He, admittedly, still has his moments where he gets the better of himself but his heart is always in the right place. If Khru Bah is the father figure in all of this then the mother figure certainly comes from Khun Mae Ead, a Buddhist nun. In addition to living the monastic lifestyle, learning how to read and write, Muay Thai (boxing), cooking, bathing, brushing teeth, washing clothes and other life skills, each novice is given a horse to take care of which gives them a very real responsibility - that of another life in addition to their own. For such a young age, or any age, this kind of lifestyle is very demanding on many levels. It's heartbreaking to see one child, initially very stubborn and seemingly hopeless, open up and begin to thrive and then, later, find out that he is summoned to come back home to his biological family who may or may not have his best interests in mind. Upon visiting him after his departure from the monastery, seeing his face and body language revert to his former, pre-monastic, self - we can see the answer. That said, there are some triumphs along the way, or are still works in progress, but there is always much more work to be done. EMS films gives a percentage of the revenue from the DVD sales to the monastery for basic school supplies, toiletries, medical supplies, the teachers, adequate living quarters, etc. These kind of monks, of the old forest tradition, are nearly extinct, however as you will see, they are still relevant and very much needed for these rural children and the hill tribe villages from which they come. Some children stay, others leave, but they all will carry this experience with them for the rest of their lives. The seeds were perhaps always within them but just needed some watering and love to allow them to grow. Pra Kruh Bah and Khun Mae Ead have done so much from so little but the children should share equally in their own success from their hard work, self discipline and dedication. The language is in Thai and is subtitled well with a minimal narrative from time to time. There are two discs, the first of which is the documentary feature but also includes a follow-up, reassessing the progress of the children after the original project was completed - and to screen the film to those whom it was about as they had never seen its completed form. The second disc is a well spring of interesting footage that was left out to keep the feature within a more efficient time frame and focuses on many of the supporting people who make the work of Kruh Bah possible. I'm sure once you see this you will want to come back to it, from time to time, and share it with others as well. I lent this to some of my friends and co-workers for which they loved it so much they ordered their own copies. As a parent, it just reaffirms my commitment to my child who, by the way, loves to watch this with me, even at age four, for the children and the horses. She really loves those horses! Anyway, I hope you enjoy it as much we have and perhaps learn something from it as well.",1259280000,26,3568,4.482334869431644
