He showed a lot of techniques that I had read about and heard, but until I actually saw him doing it, I had trouble figuring out how to do it.  He explains well  and the visual is excellent.  I learned a lot!",1470528000,4,285,4.222222222222222

8641975,5,B00IGDN65Y,"When I bought my flute I also purchased Jeff Ball's instructional book/CD 'Trailhead of the American Courting Flute', which was a good introduction.  After playing around with the basic techniques flute for a couple of years, I wanted to expand my techniques to explore and bring new levels of expression to my playing.  As a visual learned I appreciate seeing and hearing the techniques, so I bought Kalani Das' 'Flute Mastery' DVD - it was just what I was looking for so I'm very happy with the purchase and what I'm learning.

Kalani does not go into the origins of the native american flute or music theory (although he use some basic theory in naming styles of play).  Rather, the DVD is a comprehensive review and instruction on techniques / music making and has 6 chapters:
- Finger techniques
- Breath techniques
- Tongue techniques
- Voice techniques
- Styles of play
- Musical Inspiration

Some of the techniques are familiar, some are variations, and some completely unexpected. Many of the finger and breath will be familiar but Kalani adds to the repertoire with simple examples and good explanations. Other techniques are ones that I've never heard or seen before. The voice techniques, for example, were an unexpected surprise that I've not seen before - I don't know how much I'll use them but they show the possibilities I hadn't imagined. The Musical Inspiration chapter is 'short but sweet' and reviews how one might use visual inspiration and aural inspiration.

What I love about the native american flute is that it's easy and fun to play.  Kalani's 'Flute Mastery' has inspired me to continue to explore and express myself.  Highly recommended.",1397692800,19,1667,4.907473309608541
