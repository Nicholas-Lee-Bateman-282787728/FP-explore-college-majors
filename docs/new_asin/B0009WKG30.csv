8068462,3,B0009WKG30,I bought this and was excited to start learning.  But half way though it was scratched. Very disappointed. The parts that did play was very helpful in covering basics. I you do buy don't be like me and by a used one even if it says like new. The one I bought said just that and it was scratched.,1405641600,,295,4.0
8068463,4,B0009WKG30,"I purchased this video to teach a teenager how to use the airbrush.  The video included a helpful overview of the airbrush, its parts, and care and maintenance.  The video shows step-by-step creation of a beach scene.  We have little formal training in art or airbrushing, and the video helped us begin to learn.  Of course, practice is important, but he video provides a good basis to build on.",1180742400,7,395,4.681159420289855
