779397,2,6304104286,"I love foreign films because they tell the truth of the human condition unlike Hollywood-studio movies that usually sugar-coat life. Foreign films like The 400 Blows, Summer, Ikiru, Wild Strawberries, Early Spring, Late Autumn--all had a profound effect on me. They were like the independent films of today.

I should like Pather Panchali, but I didn't. Yes, it told the truth of the human condition. Yes, it had beautiful cinematography. Yes, it had an effective soundtrack. But that was it. It didn't have anything else. Let me put it this way--it didn't emotionally move me like the above- mentioned films. Why? Probably because of a lack of character development. The father is hardly even in the film. The mother is a witch to her daughter. The aunt is a caricature of an old woman who means well. Same goes for the daughter. The son comes late in the film and basically copies whatever the daughter does. The neighbors are like the bad people in a chorus of a Greek tragedy. How can anyone be emotionally moved by characters like these?! They were all pretty much one-dimensional. And to top all that off--there was no plot! Well, I wasn't surprised to see that because how can you have a plot when you have only static characters. I do not recommend this film.",1381536000,,1267,4.733031674208145

779470,5,6304104286,"When is enough - enough? The story is about an impoverished family in the rural countryside of Bengal in the 1920s. This family trying to survive and dealing with all the harsh realities of life. The young son in this family is named Apu. Panther Panchali is the first of a trilogy that will follow Apu throughout his life. When it comes down to it - you can have it all or you can have absolutely nothing and it will not be that much different. In a strange way this film displays that concept.  Panther Panchali is about life and how life is hard. There are an endless amount of themes present in Panther Panchali. What you see will most likely depend on your mood or place in life at the time of viewing. Overall it is a good movie about what is important in life. The soundtrack was composed by Ravi Shankar. It is said that this is a powerful movie. It is everything that Hollywood is not. If you sit and watch this movie closely you will understand its power & greatness.
Important note: This movie was directed by Satyajit Ray. The famous director Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai) said of Ray's work, ""To have not seen the films of Ray is to have lived in the world without ever having seen the moon and the sun.""",1306540800,,1218,4.342105263157895
779471,5,6304104286,"One of the greatest films ever made, this stunning 1955 film was the great Satyajit's Ray's first full-length work, and remains the benchmark for all the great films that followed. The film is slow paced and keeps entirely to the outskirts of one village in Bengal, but the characters are so rich and their problems so absorbing that you become entirely lost in their world. The story centers almost entirely upon one family headed by a scholarly, likable man who has returned to his crumbling family homestead from Benares (Varanasi) to raise his children with his wife. They have two children, the dreamy Durga and the always alert Apu, whom they can barely manage to feed; complicating matters is their octogenarian ""Auntie"" (the amazing Chunilbali Devi), who eats up her share of the meals and who tries to retain some sense of dignity about her despite the fights she has with the wife. The film is mostly about how a tiny community cares for each other--how food is shared among them despite its preciousness as a commodity, and the cruelties they can visit upon one another when driven by ego or shame and also the incredible generosities they are capable of when calamities strike. All the actors are great, but special commendation must be given to Karuna Bannerjee who manages to make the forever-nagging and hard-suffering mother seem so fundamentally decent. The sequence of Durga and Apu playing in the waving flax near some power lines and a railway line, which suggest a world of modernity beyond their own, is unforgettable, as is the famous sequence of the waterbugs skimming along after the rains following the wife's receipt of some very welcome news. This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen, and deserves to always be readily available.",1229212800,3,1767,4.8737541528239205
779472,5,6304104286,"Somewhere between the Oriental placidity of a great Yasujiro Ozu film and the harsh reality of a great Vittorio De Sica film lies the world of Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali, the first of his Apu Trilogy of films. And in case there was any doubt, that place is a very, very good one for any filmmaker to be, for the two aforementioned filmmakers were masters of their own sorts of films, and- if this one, and first, film of Ray's is an indication, the same plaudits can be ascribed to Ray, a former advertising firm's employee who struck out on his own to raise Indian cinema from the melodramatic doldrums it had been in since its creation.

  This almost two hour long black and white film, made in 1955, was not only Ray's debut in the medium, but the first `serious' film in Indian history- at least that made by an Indian. It is no surprise that Ray, a Bengali, made his film in his part of India- funded by the provincial government of West Bengal, away from the more commercial films of what would later be called Bollywood. The film's English subtitle is Song Of The Little Road, but this is a bit of a nonsequitur since the film is based on a novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, and the only road with any prominence in the film is a recurring hagiography of a local set of railroad tracks. Some websites claim that the title connotes the subtitle, and that Pather, in Bengali, means of a path, and Panchali means a kind of Bengal song; however, other sites and critics dispute this claim. The tale is set in the early 20th Century, although the film never specifies a date- at least not in the white English subtitles of the Artificial Eye DVD The Apu Trilogy three pack, which includes the other two films, as well: Aparajito and The World Of Apu.

  Like the Italian Neo-Realist films of De Sica, Ray relied on an excellent script (adapted by Ray, from the novel) and amateur actors, for the most part, to pull the film off. A low budget made `big' scenes an impossibility, but Ray shows off, in this film, some nice touches with the camera that cost nothing but a few minutes of cogitation. These skills all led to international praise of the film in many quarters, and a special award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.

  The plot of the tale is rather simple, and easily conveyed, but this film is a great example of how merely recapitulating or summing up a plot utterly does an injustice to the deeper and greater story....Pather Panchali is a truly great film; it is not only a classic of its native land, but of the very art form of film. And, as mentioned, it not only derives its power from Italian Neo-Realism, but also from the diurnal do of Yasujiro Ozu's films. Ozu is another filmmaker who has been criticized as dull and tedious, but both men are keen observers of their fictive worlds. In those realms the flicker of an eyebrow can have greater consequence than an army brigade's assault on an enemy. Yet, to the viewer not yet weaned off of the Lowest Common Denominator, such moments are not even noticed. I only wish that Satyajit Ray, who died in 1992, was still around to know that his film was yet influencing more people in the positive way all great art does, but realize, as he surely did, that he need not be, for great art always and eventually fills out the places the human body gives way to. In watching Pather Panchali, one gets a sense of Satyajit Ray, as he was. Go know him.",1224288000,,3423,4.464

779474,5,6304104286,"This is a great introduction to the masterful films of the late, great Indian filmmaker, Satyajit Ray.  PATHER PANCHALI is the first of the Apu Trilogy, a series of stories that takes a look at the life of Apu, a young Bengali boy from a poor background.  In this installment, Apu (Subir Bannerjee) is growing up with his older sister, Durga (Uma Das Gupta) who has the pesky habit of stealing mangos from their neighbor's tree.  His mother, Sarbojaya Ray (Karuma Bannerjee) is constantly bickering with the children's elderly aunt (Chunibala Devi) and struggling to maintain a tidy household.  Apu's father, Harihar Ray(Kanu Bannerjee) performs religious prayers and writes for a living.  He ventures out to seek work for himself, leaving his small village and family behind him.

This story examines the ups and downs that the struggling family must endure, and is truly poetry in motion.  What's more, it has a quiet intensity that flows beautifully with the wonderful musical score by the legendary sitar master, Ravi Shankar.  Be sure not to miss this treasure......",1174262400,3,1071,5.045454545454546
779475,5,6304104286,"I'm sorry to see that as if this date Amazon has no copies of this film for sale.  I hope this is temporary.  It would be a shame if this film were not made available for people to own.

I have all three DVDs of the Apu trilogy.  This, the first in the trilogy, is the best one, I think.  Three of the major themes are the irrevocable nature of loss, the power of human love, and the simple but powerful ways we experience redemption.

Many reviews focus on the title character, Apu, yet this is also a powerful portrayal of various phases of women's lives:  maiden, mother, and crone, if you will.  Durga, the maiden, is often described as a petty thief, yet her acts often seem heroic to me and serve to underscore the pettiness and selfishness of her neighbors.  Why should Durga have to steal guavas from the land that used to belong to her father?  Why can't the neighbors share?

As for stealing the beads, Durga's desire for something pretty, while not so heroic, is perfectly understandable when one realizes how little Durga is appreciated in a family that dotes on Apu, the boy. Yet there are no villains in this film.  All characters are fully rounded.  The mother, who often seems cruel, is also a sympathetic character who tries to keep her pride in tact while descending deeper into poverty all the time.

The grandmother is, to me, the best character of the bunch.  She's as mysterious as she is mischevious.  The petty bickering between Durga's mother and grandmother doesn't show an absence of love but results from the pressures of day to day survival. The women, in fact, are woven into the same tapestry of life.  In one brilliant shot, the mother is shown holding her weary back while the grandmother, bent from years of hardship and work, shuffles in the background.  Life is hard and the inevitability of old age is just around the corner.  How is one's hard work and sacrifice repaid?  Are we destined to end up like Durga's grandmother, whom nobody seems to want? Nobody, save Durga, who has a pure heart and shows her love by bringing lovingly her hungry grandmother stolen guavas.

The people and situations are never sentimentalized, not even the death of the grandmother, whose body is discovered by Durga and Apu.

Yes, this is the story of Apu, a young boy, but it's also the story of the three main phases of women's lives.  This film is rich visually and is one the viewer will think about for a long time.  One of my all-time favorite films.  PATHER PANCHALI is the best of the three, but THE WORLD OF APU doesn't miss this distinction by much.",1149724800,7,2578,4.540130151843818
779476,4,6304104286,"This film came recommended to me by several of my friends, so I felt compelled to see it.  After watching the film, I am glad that I listened to them as this was a very good movie.  Even though this is done with subtitles, I had no trouble following the story.

Although not really a draw back, this film is the first part of a trilogy, so the ending is more of a prelude to a beginning.  The story is following a Brahmin family that has fallen on hard financial times.  The ever optimistic father has trouble bringing enough money in to meet the needs of his family and keeping the ancestral home in good repair.  Tragedy after tragedy besets them, which is the impetus for the ending of this movie (and beginning of the next).

In no part of this film did I have trouble following the filmmaker's work.  The story kept me locked in and watching.  I would highly recommend this film to others.",1129075200,3,894,4.337349397590361
779477,5,6304104286,"For many Americans, this film is a first, harsh look at life amongst the poor of India. Ray's unsparing camera not only exposes the desperation such a tenuous existence creates, but also includes scenes of uplifting beauty and emotion. Rich traditions of India are brought forth through storytelling and music (by Ravi Shankar). This simply told film leaves the viewer enlightened and humbled.

779573,5,6304104286,"If you have just been introduced to the work of internationally recognized author, director Satyajit Ray (1921-1992), you will learn that Pather Panchali is part one of a trilogy that chronicles a young man, Apu.  Do start with Pather Panchali, then Aparajito, and finally, Apu Sansar.

One of the greater challenges with foreign film is the ability to read the subtitles and on Pather Panchali, it is visible and clear.

One integral aspect of  Satyajit Ray's movies is that he carefully chooses the faces of his characters, and in Pather Panchali, a most memorable character is that of octogenarian who plays Auntie.  Rough with age, she meanders bent forward at the waist and she displays a face with distinction.

Although she was an actress, Ray has been known to cast street people with no acting experience just to get the right face.  This work parellels that of neorealism, the use of non-professionals, on location, documentary style.  With his early passion for cinema one influence was from the impressionable Vittorio DeSica's Bicycle Thief, 1948.

Pather Panchali was made in mid '50s but the time reflected is the early 20s.  This is the movie that sets the stage.  Although the core is on the family upbringing, financial hardships, relationships and tragedies, Apu is a more of an observant to it all and we see the bond develop with his sister.

The story is set in a poor Bengali village.  Apu lives with his mother, Sarbajaya, sister Durga, and his father Harihar, a poet, playwright, accountant, reader of the scripture, and a dreamer is often away from home in search of work; if he gets work, he doesn't often get paid.

The family's problems are universal.  Apu's mother Sarbajaya is distraught and depressed trying to raise her family with an absentee spouse, house in major need of repairs, little money, debts, weather disasters, and it is her daughter Durga who adds problems because she steals fruit from orchards and beads from a friend.  Like today, the mother bears the brunt of criticism from villagers.

To add to the crises, the aging Auntie is under the family's care.  Sarbajaya has made Auntie feel unwanted and a burden.  Aunti knows her time is near and welcomes the peace. Played by an 80-year old theatre performer whose character is remarkable and lovable.

Finally, tragedy strikes and the family is compelled to move back to the city of Benares.  In the next segment, Aparajito, we will follow Apu to the city.  ....Rizzo",1119484800,,2466,4.891566265060241

All of the superlatives about the cinematic experience mentioned elsewhere are certainly well earned. However, my experience of the movie will forever be linked to my two years of living in an Indian village.  Some of the reviewers of the movie talk about the haunting images of love and survival that will remain with them for a long time.  I can only say that the images from the movie that were so moving represent a small fraction of the often overwhelming images and experiences I gained firsthand from living with people who could have been characters in Pather Panchali or either of the other two movies in the trilogy.  What Ray has done is to create an epic poem about a man's life, in three films, that is powerful in part because it is based upon his faithful re-creation of the most minute details of his own experience of Bengali village life.  It has been more than 35 years since I left that South Indian village as a young man and my memories of my life there are tinged with the same poignancy and strong emotions that come when viewing Pather Panchali.  Over the years, I have seen most of Ray's other films, mainly in India.  However, none of his other films surpasses Pather Panchali in power and beauty.",1113782400,10,1358,4.473684210526316

779576,5,6304104286,"I ordered this DVD off Amazon.com because I had seen its' name pop up over the years as one of the best movies of all time.  I am not going to promote nor challenge that reputation.  I found it to be an outstanding movie worthy of its' praise but be mindful that this is no ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Godfather"", nor ""Lawrence of the Arabia"".  This is because, for most of the film, it does not appear to have a plot.  What we get are seemingly the scenes of life in a rural Bengali household at some point in time in the first half of the 20th Century.  For awhile, we keep waiting for things to ""happen"" while gradually taking note of the different lifestyles and the various personalities that we see on the screen.  Eventually, and unfortunately, things later DO happen and, by the time they do, we have become intimately attached to the family we have been watching.  I will not go into detail as to the events but I do want to say that I was deeply moved and I know that there are scenes in this movie that will always pull on my heart strings.  The reason for the impact, I realized, was in the brilliance of the cinematic presentation.  Although only his first movie, the director, Satyajit Ray, shows a masterful ability to create visual images that convey deep meanings.  There are scenes of love and grief that are among the most powerful I've ever seen.  There are subtle incidents and images that tell us vollumes about the characters and events.

I know that India has a significant film industry and has had for years but I don't believe I've ever seen an ""Indian"" movie before.  One of the things that impressed me the most about the movie was the quality of the acting.  There is an elderly women referred to as ""Auntie"" who has to be seen to be believed.  She is the image of a broken-down old woman and she would have stolen the spotlight in any other movie (and often does in this one).  However, there is enough other talent to keep our attention moving around.  The daughter, Durga, is quite memorable as is Apu.  The father is a bit odd but that is the image I believe he was meant to convey.  It is the mother, whose name escapes me, that leaves the greatest impression.  She is a woman who feels that she was meant to live a better life but struggles everyday to make the most of what she has.  She is the strength of the family yet she has obvious faults.  Bad luck haunts her all the way but, though she complains, she will not give up.

I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a brilliantly depiction of a family's struggle with life itself.  I do not recommend the movie to those who don't particularly care to get emotionally involved with a movie's characters.

779578,5,6304104286,"This one reminded me of another great Asian film, Tokyo Story. Of course, this film takes place in India in 1919, so it is of the early 20th century while Tokyo Story covered emerging Japan in the early 1950's. But India in 1919 was poor and surely nothing has changed. The contrast between the emerging Japan and Satyajit Ray's impoverished Brahmans is quite stark except for the slow interplay and paced crisis in the screenplays. The gradual destruction of the little boy Apu's family unfolds step-by-step delivering pathos, simple pleasures, the loneliness, sickness, and death of a loved one. Modern audiences will have trouble sitting there as this unfolds, but it is worth it.

  Black and white photography has its fans, and the cinematography of Pather Panchali is fascinating. The bamboo forests, the rice patties, the lakes full of wildlife are photographed. The people seem to weave between this nature and we can only imagine the Indian landscape in shocking color. This is both strength and a weakness. I wanted to see the colors, but alas.

779580,5,6304104286,"Delicate, almost lyrical black-and-white images, offer insight into the harshness of life in a rural Bengali village. Panther Panchali is the first movie in Satyajit Ray's (1921-1992) compelling Apu Trilogy. Ravi Shankar's hauntingly beautiful music takes this movie to a mythical level.

Satyajit Ray's ability to reveal this story at a leisurely pace, all while intriguing you with the details of Indian life, keeps you captive to the last minute. Even the old stone buildings of the ancestral home seem artistic.

In the first story we find Durga stealing guavas and Apu is not yet born. As Durga's mother, Sarbajaya (Karuna Bannerjee), struggles to look after family members she is already responsible for, her relatives criticize her for her lack of leadership in the family. The auntie Indir (Chunibala Devi) takes delight in Durga's adventures and loves the gifts of bananas and guavas.

There is a comforting scene where she is seen sitting against an ancient wall while she rocks Apu in a basket hanging from the ceiling. As she sings there is a moment of serenity in this world where each day seems to be a fight for survival. Her optimistic attitude is almost heroic in the light of how she is often treated. She has much to offer her community and excels at story telling. Watch for the scene where her face is silhouetted against the wall late at night. This movie has many cinematic moments that border on enlightened creativity.

For some reason, this movie reminded me of living in Africa on a campsite/farm where we would borrow a cup of sugar from the neighbors house or wander down a path to the river. Here we find the comical ""Indir"" stealing chilies or other cooking supplies from Sarbajaya. Sarbajaya is overwhelmed by her own life and yet later she is faced with her own loneliness as she sinks into depression.

Apu's father, Harihar, struggles to find work although he has dreams of seeing his plays performed. He is truly an example of a beautiful soul vibrating at a higher level of creativity than those around him and yet he is forced to take on menial work just to survive.

As the story progresses Apu grows into an adorable whisp of a child and I love the scene where he and his sister walk down the well-worn path. There are scenes of dancing in the monsoon rains and while all the characters seem to be living in their own worlds, they somehow function in their community in a meaningful way. As the rains bring life back to the land, nothing can prepare you for the emotional impact of the scenes that follow.

Overall, I was impressed with the brilliance of the storytelling and how each story weaves almost effortlessly into the next. Pather Panchali is one of the rare film experiences no one should miss. Not only does it address the basics of survival in a community, it makes you think about your own role and how your choices affect everyone around you.

If you can watch Aparajito and The World of Apu in the next few days following your first viewing of Panther Panchali, your experience will turn into a complete immersion in the intriguing and exotic world of Apu. After watching the first movie, I could hardly wait to watch the second and within a day I had watched the third. These movies will leave you in the deepest of contemplation for days and not only will you find yourself lost within the minds of the characters, you will enjoy all the connections between the movies.

779581,4,6304104286,"No question about the fact that the effort that went into restoring the film is laudable. The DVD disappoints somewhat on a couple of counts. Firstly, if you want to watch it again with subtitles off, just to admire the visual compositions (in Ray's own words, there's no beautiful or ugly shots...only the right and wrong ones) that went into the storytelling, it doesn't let you do so. The subtitles, can, therefore be distracting. Secondly, there are loads of material written (a lot of it by Ray himself) and filmed (like interviews, especially the ones by Lindsay Anderson, and by Shyam Benegal/Govind Nihalani) with anecdotes of how the film was shot, and which could have been included in the DVD; such are material which make a DVD a truly collectible item. But really can't complain too much ... better something than nothing.",1075939200,10,835,4.887323943661972

779643,5,6304104286,"Once upon a time, in the early years of the last century, a young boy named Apu lived with his poor Brahmin family in a village in Bengal.  The father, Harihar Ray (Kanu Bannerjee) is a poet and a priest, who would rather think of an idea for his next play than make an effort to get the money that is owed him, and who responds to the hardships of life with the simple declaration, ""Whatever God does is for the best.""  Consequently, he has to travel far away for long periods of time to try and raise the money his family needs to survive, to pay back their debts, and to repair the family home, which is falling down.  This leaves his wife and two children to survive as best they can in this intimate and poetic film.
The two things I knew about this classic Indian film before I watched it was that it was the first by director Satyajit Ray and the first in the Apu trilogy.  I found the later more interesting because Apu (Subir Bannerjee) is arguable the least significant of the major characters in this film, which centers more on his mother, Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee), and especially his sister, Durga (Uma Das Gupta).  Durga is something of a petty theft, who is always stealing fruit from the neighborhood orchards.  Her mother defends her behavior to the neighbors, pointing out that fruit does not have the name of its owner on it, but she does not know what to do about Durga, or about the family's old auntie (Chunibala Devi).  Apu is a witness to some of what happens, but it is not until the end of the film that he has a scene of some importance.  Even then, it is the poetry of the moment that matters more than anything Apu does, and you are left with a sense of wonder as to how Ray has crafted this film so that this relatively simple moment becomes so eloquent.
""Pather Panchali"" was also known as ""The Lament of the Path,"" ""The Saga of the Road,"" and ""Song of the Road,"" all of which give you a sense of the meaning and import of the title.  You would be hard pressed to describe the plot of this movie in terms that would be enticing to an audience that is going to have to sit down and read subtitles for a film, but there are so many memorable moments in this film without dialogue, that being forced to read the English subtitles of the Bengali dialogue seems a small price to pay.  This is about a poor rural family cursed with bad luck, and even that minor description gives no indication of the scope of this film.  Even when nothing is happening, the scenes are still filled with meaning, and we never shake the feeling that we are watching real life.
After seeing this film I started reading up on Ray and the legendary story of how he made this film, it is rather unbelievable when you consider we are talking about one of the greatest ""foreign"" film directors of all time, right up there with Kurosawa, Bergman, and Fellini.  The short version is Ray had never directed a scene, his cameraman (Subrata Mitra) was a still photographer who had never shot a film, and his young actors had been hired without tryouts.  He also hired a young musician named Ravi Shankar to do the score, and the result was cinematic magic and a film debut that is unforgettable.  ""Pather Panchali"" is followed by ""Aparajito"" (1957) and ""Apur Sansar"" (1959) in telling the rest of the story of young Apu as he grows up.  I have not seen then yet, but of course I will.  I just need to let the afterglow of having finally seen this film dissipate first before I move on to the next offering in the trilogy.",1073520000,35,3521,4.36085626911315
779644,5,6304104286,"Satyajit Ray produced this simple film set in a small village in Bengal. The story is of a Brahmin who struggles to support his family. He has to travel in a search to find something. Against his travels the story of the family is explained. The black and white photography is the work of genius.
When the film was made it was as if India was introduced into the world of serious cinema. The film containes scene after scene which are unforgetable. An early work by one of the great directors of all time.
The film went on to become a triology. It is difficult to describe the sensation of seeing it. One of infinite saddness but at the same time one can not but admire its beauty.",1062201600,9,681,4.328125
779645,5,6304104286,"Some reviewer writes that this is an over-rated film. If anything this is an under-rated film. Because this is made in Bengali, very few people in India can appreciate this film far less the international audience. Bengali films and that too in 1950s were not promoted, not properly subtitled with the result that this film is confined to  art-house audiences in India and elsewhere. I have seen Citizen Kane and let me tell you this is comparable if not better.
Ray is criticized on 2 fronts by 2 different sets of people. Some people denigrate him as having sold India's poverty for awards. Others castigate him from glorifying poverty and for given a rose tinted view of poverty. Well you cant please everyone. Ray is not a social reformer, he is an artist with celluloid. So while his films are not meant to stir you into ""action"", he also does not succumb to making traditional Indian escapist song fests so that everyone can feel ""good"".
This isn't a film--its a dream. It is about an Indian boy, who despite the death,sorrow,poverty  he encounters at every stage in his life manages to keep his innocence and his dreams intact. It is about the courage to dream and the indomitable force of life. People who think this is dark and depressing miss out on the heart of Pather Panchali and on the Apu trilogy. On the contrary this is the greatest celebration of life ever captured on celluloid.
And the haunting background score, the beautiful imagery, the rains falling on the pond, the necklace vanishing into the vegetation over the water......oh if this is not poetry then tell me what is ?
See this....just see this. Thats all I can say.",1016064000,16,1645,4.688581314878893
779646,4,6304104286,"There has been a conspiracy in film histories, even in those that profess sympathy to non-American cinemas, to reduce Indian cinema to the populism of Bollywood and the humanism of Satyajit Ray.  It is when you see audacious films like Ghitak's 'The Cloud-Capped Star' that Ray's conservatism becomes apparent, his stylistic restraint, his formal totalising, his apoliticism.
This is not to say that 'Pather' isn't full of good things - the move from social realism to the mystical; the montages of nature; the Gothic structure leading to the most harrowing storm in cinema; the space for comedy and play amidst all the poverty; the startling introduction of Apu.

Nothing magical, nothing remarkable, and yet their lives encompass all the varied emotions that is  within us all. That is the greatness of this film. It is ageless and  universal. The bond between the girl Durga and Auntie,the old old lady is  sweet and moving. So is the love between the little brother Apu and elder  sister Durga. The simple things that fill these children with happiness,  like a passing train, transport us to the simplicity of our childhood. The  song when old Auntie calls to God in the gloomy dusk, to relieve her from  the burden of this earth is haunting and sad, in that we feel the utter  loneliness of the old woman. Each scene, is filled with meaning and there  are no artificial sounds. In one of the scenes, with Durga and Apu roaming  in the fields, there is just a heavy stillness, broken just by the sound of  a sighing wind. The sitar recital by Ravi Shankar when the monsoon breaks  and the first drops of rain fall, with the insects dancing over the  rippling lake is magical and poetic.

7861553,5,6304104286,"I watched ""Pather Panchali"" on the Criterion re-issue of the Apu Trilogy, but I wanted to review it separately.  It's hard to come at it with innocent eyes, so the speak, when one knows that it is Satyajit Ray's first film, and that it owes something to Italian neo-realism, and that in making it as an independent film, Ray set his face against a tradition of Indian film-making that seemed to him superficial and escapist.  If you know all that, even as broadly as I do, then you can see the point of his moviemaking.  Conventional plot is dispensed with, to be replaced by the chronology of ordinary life and its contingencies; the characters are poor Bengali villagers, living in crumbling buildings at close quarters with their neighbors, and facing problems of poverty -- debt, an uncertain future for their children, domestic uncertainty (as in the case of Sarbajaya [Karuna Banerjee], whose husband, an itinerant preacher and would-be writer, vanishes to the city in hopes of finding work and financial security).  The children grow up -- we see Apu come into the world, and we see him and his older sister over the next ten years.  That sounds a bit documentary-like, but there is no explanatory voice-over, and the film has a definite visual rhythm that circles back to the domestic dwelling, which is always in  a state of decay, and takes in, as the children get older, a wider world of the surrounding forests, the fields beyond, and the railroad, which seems to speak of an even wider world but which, in this movie, seems to mark the outer limits for the villagers and especially Apu's mother.

The characters, including the children, are deftly individualized, with Apu's mother and his sister (Uma Das Gupta) being most clearly in the forefront.  Character-development isn't really the point -- rather it is the feelings, moods, and behavior of people conscious of a constricted life.  Their responses for an audience in 2016 will seem strange, and even in 1955, when the film appeared, the representation of women's lives -- which is really what the movie is about, with three generations of Apu's family in the picture -- must have seemed both exotic and yet dismaying.  What I'll remember most about the movie is Karuna Banerjee's performance -- it is a study in a fight against what we would call hopelessness and depression, though the latter term would perhaps be meaningless in the culture that's represented.  She isn't introspective, and she deals with situations as they arise, and it's hard to see just how she keeps going on. It's a great performance.  Her often-absent husband (Kanu Banerjee), who seems good-natured and wants to believe in the possibility of his success, comes across as a hapless and naive optimist who seems to live at a distance from the experiences of the women in his family.

The Criterion transfer is fine -- nice black-and-white images that show their age a bit but which work to help make real the limits of the lives we see.  Color, one might imagine, might put a veneer of exoticism on this subject matter.  I don't know that color was an option for Ray -- but B&W is right anyway.",1454803200,2,3140,4.799628942486085
