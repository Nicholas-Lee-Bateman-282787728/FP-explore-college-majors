1974396,5,B00016MC9U,"The world of detectives abounds with sharp minds, fast fists, clever perceptions, and organized method.  Jack Frost doesn't posses any of these.  But he is believable and likable.  Following him on his exploits is a sheer joy.  It is gritty, funny, and cleverly plotted.  David Reynolds is the perfect Jack Frost!",1104710400,8,313,5.0588235294117645
1974397,5,B00016MC9U,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a top notch Englsh polcier and worthy of 5 stars. However I wonder if there is not a show missing.

1974398,4,B00016MC9U,This is another very nice british mystery series. Good modern stories. I'd buy it again. I have the first three seasons and I plan on buying the fourth. This is the same actor that was in The Darling Buds of May.,1097971200,5,212,4.195121951219512
1974399,4,B00016MC9U,"This is similar in vein to the better American police television dramas.  A detective is confronted with several cases that intertwine, along with clues that at first tend to mislead, but later, when better interpreted, bring loose ends together.  The acting, character development, pace and story development hold attention most of the time.  If you enjoy detective dramas with a British twist, add this one to your list.",1083974400,14,422,5.176470588235294
1974400,5,B00016MC9U,"A Touch of Frost is an outstanding British mystery series, and it is high time it was released on DVD.  This set contains the entire first series--three 100-minute episodes entitled ""Care and Protection"", ""Not with Kindness"", and ""Conclusions.""  At the time of writing, series two is also available (for preordering), and I only hope that the video company will see fit to release the entire series.

David Jason (Only Fools and Horses, The Darling Buds of May, Open All Hours, Micawber), who personally is one of my favourite British actors, stars as Jack Frost, a dedicated, single-minded detective inspector with a nose for ferretting out criminals.  Frost is a bit like a dog with a bone when he sets his mind on something, and he doesn't worry too much about letting little things like rules, procedures, tactfulness, or even legality get in the way of finding out the truth--if he can get away with it, that is.  This is a man whose loathing for the criminal element--for those who hurt or destroy the lives of others--verges on the personal.  At the very least, his dedication to duty is more than just a job for him, it's his whole life--his raison d'etre.  Certainly, his personal life suffers greatly from his dedication--indeed obsession--with his work.
The series opens with Frost's wife on her deathbed.  Even in such a situation (perhaps, indeed, because of it--for Frost does not handle personal tragedy well), he is unable to spend the time at his wife's side that is expected.  While this may sound rather morbid and depressing, I must emphasize that overall the series is not.  Certainly, the crimes that are committed are serious and tragic, but like the Inspector Morse series (a series with which this one compares well), the episodes are punctuated by quite a healthy dose of humour, and like Morse it is primarily character humour.  In other words, it arises out of the idiosyncrasies in the inspector's character, which become more apparent as we become more familiar with the character.  In Frost's case, apart from his questionable tactics, he's extremely disorderly, and his dedication to his work is matched only by his loathing for paperwork--a trait which often has him at odds with his punctilious boss, Superintendent Mullett.  Indeed, Frost is perennially ducking into doorways or skipping out of the office in attempts to avoid the unwelcome confrontations.  One thing Frost does not have, unlike Inspector Morse, is a regular ""Sergeant Lewis"" in tow; rather, he has a different sergeant assigned to him for almost every episode.
One aspect which, in my opinion, makes A Touch of Frost such a good series is the powerful punch of irony that usually occurs at the end of each episode.  Often one can really sympathise with the killer or at the very least understand his or her motivation.  Sometimes we find that it's one trifling incident--someone in the wrong place at the wrong time--or a petty misunderstanding that sets the wheels in motion for a tragic outcome.  Often it seems that the bringing of the criminal to justice is the greatest injustice.
In conclusion, this is a well-acted and an extremely well-written mystery series--one with quite hard-hitting stories, thus making the comic relief all the more welcome.  It is a series which I recommend very highly to fans of British mysteries in particular--if you enjoy shows like Inspector Morse, for example, or have enjoyed PBS's erstwhile Mystery! series, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one.  I would, however, go so far as to recommend this series to anyone looking for a superior quality mystery series, British or otherwise.  Personally, I've always wondered why it was never made a part of PBS's Mystery! series, for it was certainly worthy of inclusion.",1083542400,102,3750,4.979166666666667
1974401,5,B00016MC9U,"I am a huge fan of English cozy mysteries but am fast running out of shows. So, I decided to try something a little more serious and ""A Touch of Frost"" sounded interesting so I took a chance.
What first struck me when watching it was how real everything looked. David Jason, in the title role, looks like a real cop, the town looks like a real town and the people act like real people. The situations are dramatic but you always believe in the characters.
Frost is a sloppy, intelligent, gruff and thoroughly likable character in spite of, or maybe because of, his rough edges. The mysteries are literate and manage to get their point across without being horrifically graphic. (Though there is violence and some innuendo and a very brief glimpse of a breast, I can't recommend this show for children)
""Care and Protection""- When the young daughter of a local woman goes missing, Frost is called in. Relieved, since he is dealing with a terminally ill wife, Frost sets to work. But when a decades old corpse with a severed arm and a suitcase attached is discovered during the search for the girl, Frost finds himself dealing with two cases at once. In this episode, he is teamed up with the fairly amiable but spoiled nephew of the superintendant. Very good episode that deals with the triple drain on Frost's emotions, his dying wife, a cold case he didn't want and the missing child whose chances for survival decrease as time passes.
""Not With Kindness""- Following the death of his wife, Frost is at odds with her Americanized sister. Meanwhile, a papergirl's body is discovered in a graveyard and she may or may not be a victim of rape. The subplot deals with an affluent couple who are being harassed by phonecalls and and deadly practical jokes. Frost is partnered with an even sloppier career cop who has an irritatingly happy family life. A rather sad episode that deals with the dangers of grief.
""Conclusions""- A fatal hit-and-run leads Frost to the spoiled rotten son of a mamber of parliament. Meanwhile, there has been a robbery at a local casino and an armed and dangerous fugitive is loose in the area. When a patrolman is brutally murdered, the manhunt is on. Frost is partnered with a surley new transfer who has a perfectly rotten homelife and a brooding manner. He's almost too surly for Frost!
I highly recommend this series to all fans of cozies who are ready to try something a little more serious and to any mystery fan, especially if you want something a little more realistsic than is offered in this country.",1083542400,56,2534,4.658482142857143
1974402,4,B00016MC9U,"This first series of Frost is quite gritty and dirty and examines racial and class prejudice in Britain in the 80's, at least the TV version of such. Several seasons into the series Frost became a lot more like Morse with high-class white villians but at least the first few series were down and dirty.
If you've never seen it give yourself a treat!",1081296000,4,349,4.46875
1974403,5,B00016MC9U,"Frost is greatly entertaining on several levels. It obeys the key rule of great shows: all the secondary level characters are equally entertaining as well. It's a detective/cop type show. It's sort of between Morse and Cracker. It's not as gritty as Cracker but it's much more enjoyable and it has much more of a realistic feel than Morse. It's middle England and all it's pleasures, vices and characteristics but in many ways it's middle anywhere: people struggling to get by, unpleasant events and people muddling through. I recently watched it in a hotel in Costa Rica with Spanish subtitles and could only wonder what the Costa Ricans made of it!

1974431,4,B00016MC9U,"Have seen three episodes of season one, so only my impression so far: ""A Touch of Frost"" is a classic, old school police detective mystery series in the time honored British genre.  Murder at the beginning, sleuthing for rest of show, logical but often hard to figure out eventual culprit.  Crime done for interesting psychological reasons.  Have been through Foyle, Morse, Lewis, and Vera, so Frost seems to be the next in line.  An interesting junior partner, which helps to invigorate the other series, has yet to emerge.  So far, maybe not action-packed enough for some viewers, but generally fairly well written and appealing to lovers of the genre.",1439337600,2,654,4.963302752293578

David Jason has a great time in the leading role: the camera highlights his facial tics that communicate much more than words ever can.  He always has been a superb actor, both in straight as well as comic parts.  The fictional town of 'Denton' where the action is set, is portrayed as a typically British provincial town; neither violent nor idyllic, but somewhere where crime inevitably takes place.

It's a vehicle to watch Frost do his thing and see how he solves the crime through joking. Frost is a kick to watch and listen to, which maximizes the entertainment value.  An hour on the treadmill can whiz by when Frost is on the telly--you don't even feel like you're exercising.  Love this series and the characters.",1326758400,2,637,4.651785714285714

This is not a humorous show by any means, it's about a struggling detective whose wife has died and all he  has left is his job.

We rate it 3 stars because it has not too bad of a plot and that the main character (David Jason) has at least the sense of humor that helped us tolerate the 'depressing' rest of the story and get a few laughs out of it too. What turns us off of this is the 'depressing home life' that is constantly brought into the story. For us that takes away from the 'actual' storyline. I also went on the judgement of what the others here have said that the 5th or 6th season is much better, so we may not rule this out totally just yet. I might still try the other series (starting at the 5th or 6th season, of course,) and hope then that this storyline will improve. If I still get the 'depressing storyline' and the 'depressing home life' though, I won't be buying any more of ""A Touch of Frost"". At this point in time as far as were concerned is the following: if you like the 'Coronation Street' type of mystery then this is for you, if you don't, then it's best to start a bit later in the series or not get any at all.",1316649600,2,1074,4.046948356807512

The first season contained more bad language than the later seasons.
Also, one of the  first season episodes contained a woman topless due to her robe hanging open.
Thus, it is not suitable for children or ones offended by these things.

I have avoided Frost because there were very few reviews, and the actual description just didn't make me want to watch it.  This is the BEST series from the UK Mystery/Crimes I have seen, thank goodness for the sale that made it affordable.  I only have one complaint, the ridiculously short ""seasons""/""Volumes"".  I'd be pretty upset if I spent $40-50 on a two or three disc set, with three or four episodes.

It's creepy, spooky, foggy, and the music is unbelievable at the beginning.  You've got to love FROST, he's so loveable, so wonderful, and I just can't stand his boss, who could care less about solving a case, or convisting the guilty person, it's all about politics and what looks good - that makes me so mad.....but not mad anough to not watch, which is a fine line.

I needed a new, creepy, curl up before bed crime show that isn't so gruesome or action oriented that it makes my heart race while I'm watching-cause then I can't go to sleep right after.  This is the Perfect, creepy, go to sleep mystery.  It's hard to explain but if you like the creepy, foggy, cozy mystery types, this is the one for you.  I bought season one a few weeks ago and have already finished 1, 2, and started 3, and now ordered 4.  Now, there's nothing else I want to watch before bed, this has the perfect amount of crime and creepy without the heart pounding action that I prefer in prime time.

If you like a slick, perfect looking, modern, all the cops could be runway models (male and female), high heels, designer clothes, high-tech super slick looking, HD quality crime, then this is not for you.

1974581,5,B00016MC9U,"I have already gone on record with the judgment that Foyle's War is the premier British detective series.  It is not really fair to call Frost a close second, because the tone, atmospherics and intent are quite different.  Frost is superb.  A Detective Inspector in the fictional town of Denton (we know that it is in the Thames Valley), Jack Frost faces the grittier realities of modern Britain.  A crusty widower, who is alienated from the 'new' ways and the managerial superintendent who embodies them, Frost is a classic noir hero.  Tough but with a core of sweetness, he expresses his love carefully, metering it out like a coin-fed British heater.  He is always eating and never seems to suffer from his comfort-food excesses.  Sir David Jason nails the performance.  Though he never represented the Frost envisioned by the character's creator, his performances are consistently excellent.  Across the series, he utilizes a series of assistants, all of whom contribute to the general effect, with George, his Detective Sergeant, appearing regularly.  The series is very British in its culture, but that culture is the culture of the street, not that of theme-park Britain.  The writing, the direction, the plot arcs and the performances are always of a very high order.  This is great entertainment; it is also entertainment that regularly approaches serious drama and serious art.  Don't miss it.",1231200000,18,1403,5.100877192982456

1974583,5,B00016MC9U,"The Brits do these things so much better than us Yanks.
Here's why: In British crime shows, the lead character is typically not (1) handsome; (2) heroic; (3) handy with his fists; (4) sophisticated; (5) physically fit; (6) debonair; (7) materially successful, i.e., someone with posh clothes, home, car, etc.. (8) happily married.

American programmers, always trend followers, worshippers of escapism, and, most importantly, terribly fearful of low ratings, feel compelled to load their shows with incredibly handsome supermen and beautiful women with perfect bodies and hair, who always look cool and drive fabulous cars, and live in huge, airy, magnificently furnished homes and flats.

The idea of David Jason starring in an American TV show is ludicrous. He is a short, drab, homely, balding, portly, rumpled, middle-aged man, seemingly the antithesis of ""sexy"". William ""Billy"" ""Jack"" Frost probably couldn't do one pushup. I doubt he'd pass a police shooting test. He's probably impotent. Doesn't really care much or know much about what's going on outside his own little world. He's a moody sort and most of the time his moods are black. All in all, not a real nice guy.

But when it comes to police work, he's aces. Has an uncanny knack for sniffing out rats. These shows are simply fabulous. The characters and acting are just top-notch all the way. Topical. Hard-hitting. Believable. And funny! That's another thing that is so great about the show: the cynicism, sarcasm and wicked irony are razor-sharp. You have to really pay attention to catch it all. I'm not sure if I'd hold up too well in the bitter, biting cold and slashing rain of England's midlands, which are displayed often here. A sunny, optimistic series this is not!

Inspector Frost's streets are unhappy ones filled with people living quiet and not so quiet lives of despair.  Frost is a melancholy program with mournful music punctuating the episodes.  But despite his own unhappy personal life and gruff persona, Frost is a man of sympathy for the hopeless and helpless and anger at the monsters who prey on them.  My wife calls this that silly Frost thing, finding it too bleak for her tastes.  Based upon my own experiences in a law enforcement career, I find A Touch of Frost to be one of the most believable of police programs.  Even with the bleak mood of the program, I do not find it depressing.  David Jason, an actor who can make sir seem the most insulting of epithets, is just about the perfect actor to portray this version of Frost.  I say this version because the author of the Frost novels has complained that this version is much different from the Frost in the books.
