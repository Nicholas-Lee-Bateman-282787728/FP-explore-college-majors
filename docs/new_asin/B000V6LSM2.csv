2930888,5,B000V6LSM2,"Could there be anything in this turbulent world we now live in
than to sit down and watch the Real McCoys. It is so wonderful
and relaxing to the soul. The truth of truths is they truly
don't make TV shows or movies like this anymore. Maybe some of
the Hallmark shows come close, but its nice to sit there and just
allow your mind to wonder back to a time when life was a litte
more settled. No 24/7 news to keep you wondering what is next.
Yes, the Real McCoy is just that. The name says it all. Great
picture and sound. You'll love it.",1243036800,2,537,4.02803738317757
2930889,5,B000V6LSM2,I love to watch the REAL McCOYS on dvd. Brings back the good old days.,1233273600,3,70,3.7333333333333334

2930891,4,B000V6LSM2,"The 224 half-hour episodes (all in B&W) of the situation comedy ""The Real McCoys"" ran from 1957-1963 on ABC and CBS. The show's creators/producers were Irving and Norman Pincus, a pair of brothers with little other claims to fame.

But they left quite a legacy with ""The Real McCoys"" as the series literally changed the direction of network situation comedy. Early sitcoms like ""I Love Lucy"", ""The Honeymooners"", ""Make Room for Daddy"", and ""The Goldbergs"" were urban in tone and set in downtown apartments in big east coast cities; urban families were the first buyers of televisions. By the mid-fifties suburbia was getting a lot play (""Life of Riley"", ""Leave It to Beaver"") as Americans began moving out to the suburbs. But network executives were resistant to the idea of rural characters in rural setting. Rural families were unlikely to own televisions (or have television stations within broadcast range) and urban sophisticates could not be expected to tune into a show featuring rural rubes.

When ""The Real McCoys"" proved the suits wrong it set the stage for Andy of Mayberry, Jed in Beverly Hills, Kate and the Shady Rest, and Oliver and Lisa in Hooterville. Danny Thomas and Paul Henning who would launch those shows were both involved in ""The Real McCoys"".

The premise of the show is the move of the legendary West Virginia McCoys to a farm in the San Fernando Valley they inherit from their uncle. Given the current value of valley real estate it is amusing that one of the central conflicts of the series is the family's precarious financial position (insert lack of money here).

The McCoy family is a bit unusual as it skips an entire generation. Grandpa Amos (Walter Brennan) lives with his grandson Luke (Richard Crenna), Luke's new wife Kate (Kathy Nolan), and Luke's little brother and sister (Michael Winkleman and Lydia Reed). Apparently Luke's parents mysteriously died.

Like ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", the comedy comes from watching the family adapt to their new environment and seeing things we take for granted from a fresh perspective. And like Granny on that series, Amos is stubborn and irascible. The beauty of the series is that it finds satirical humor in the unsophisticated way of country folk while demonstrating that their backwoods wisdom often puts them ahead of the curve.

Luke and Kate join Oliver and Lisa Douglas of ""Green Acres"" as television's all-time most ""in-love"" couples and this dynamic is the shows underlying strength. Crenna and Nolan deliver fine performances throughout the series. Brennan is likewise excellent, managing to make a basically annoying character lovable. Amos is nicely overplayed as a cantankerous old coot full of rural aphorisms and blustering exasperations yet fully repentant when he goes too far.

Also notable is Tony Martinez as Pepino Garcia, a Mexican farmhand who just came with the farm. Pepino is a frequent foil for Grandpa, as his more laid-back approach to life often riles up the old guy. They do a nice job of avoiding what could have been a negative stereotype as Pepino is the best adjusted character on the series and second only to Kate in the wisdom department. Kate left the cast after the 5th season, she was missed.

2930892,5,B000V6LSM2,"I remember watching this series on TV as a very young boy in the 1950's.  It was a great sitcom back then, and it still is a great sitcom.  Walter Brennan was the star of the show, but the other cast members were perfect for their roles.

2930926,5,B000V6LSM2,"I just finished watching all 39 season 2 episodes of this show, and it remains a wonderful, well-written and acted show. Stand-out episodes this season include ""The McCoys Go To Hollywood"", which gives us a funny cameo by Barbara Stanwyck, a glimpse inside the Desilu Studios, and a fine turn by guest-star Dorothy Provine. ""Sweet Fifteen"" sounds like a run-of-the-mill surprise birthday party episode, but it takes an unexpected dramatic turn which highlights the acting of the cast, and in particular, Lydia Reed as Hassie. ""The Insurance Policy"", which highlights the importance of having health insurance, seems particularly timely today for reasons which will be obvious to anyone who watches the episode. Watching season 2, I really began to notice all the funny little mannerisms that Walter Brennan brought to his role of Grampa McCoy. Whenever a female kisses him on the cheek, he quickly and almost unnoticably brushes the kiss off. What an actor Walter Brennan was! In the season opener, the story concerns the McCoys' decision to replace their ancient (even for 1958) Ford Model A for a newer model. The way he talks about the old jalopy, as if it were truly a member of the family, brought tears to my eyes. Only an actor as good as he could pull that off! There are some truly laugh-out-loud moments, balanced with tearful sentiment in this really fine series. Perhaps younger people will shy away from this black-and-white series from another era, but for those who like shows with characters that act like real people, and stories which will leave a satisfied smile on your face, this is one show that is hard to beat. The other actors in the cast, Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan, Michael Winkelman, Madge Blake, Andy Clyde and Tony Martinez are all superb. You'll see many fine character actors troupe through the series, as well. A wonderful show.",1385769600,,1862,4.93312101910828

There they have humorous situations in their everyday lives ( mostly due to grandpa mccoy), and life is laid back, easy, and slow. You will laugh at the antics of grandpa, as he tries to weedle out of a tough spot caused by himself. Walter Brennan is a wonderful actor, and he makes the show. Kate Mccoy is a sweet person, who always sees the bright side of life, and often points out right from wrong to the rest of the family. She is the backbone of the family. Her husband, Luke, played by actor, Richard Crenna, is a sweet, loveable guy, but a bit of a hick, who is handsome, but somewhat naive and gullable. Then there is brother, Little Luke, and sister Hassie. They make up the family known as, The Real Mccoys. Last, but not least is farmhand, Pepino. A very good singer, I might add.

2930957,5,B000V6LSM2,"The Real McCoys was the first of the great rural comedies that aired on network television until the early 1970s, when Fred Silverman killed them all. If you like one of its successors, The Andy Griffith Show, you will love The Real McCoys. Those two series shared several of the same writers, including the great Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum, and both had great acting.
Real McCoys star Walter Brennan is quite arguably one of the top five actors of the 20th century--he is still one of only four actors or actresses to win at least three Oscars (the others are Katherine Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman and Jack Nicholson--pretty good company).
And unlike The Andy Griffith Show, The Real McCoys' episodes will seem new to you because they have not been rerun much since 1966. Though The Real McCoys started more than 50 years ago, the picture quality and sound are great. I hope Infinity will soon release Season Four, which was the highest rated of the series (finishing in Nielsen's top five that year, the highest for any ABC comedy to that point).
I also hope that errors in some other reviews (including one that incorrectly says Pepino left the cast after the third season when he actually appeared in all six seasons) have not contributed to the delay in releasing season four.
There were some big-name guest stars on The Real McCoys too before they became big stars. This season includes Irene Ryan, later of The Beverly Hillbillies, barely recognizable without her Granny costume, though the voice sounds the same (Season one included a guest spot by Raymond Bailey, later Mr. Drysdale on The Beverly Hillbillies, though he was barely recognizable without his toupee).
In short, this is one of the greatest shows of all time, and I hope the rest of the seasons will be released soon.",1248307200,,1793,4.805825242718447
