Well recorded/produced music of the Yardbirds is hard to find.  This disc is just another example of the neglect of the Yardbirds' fine talents.  Too bad, since I consider them one of the truly premier seminal rock groups of the 1960s.",1372377600,2,468,4.728395061728395
8490292,1,B0060ANV5U,"A misleading quote from the maker of this DVD starts off by saying ""This DVD contains more than 20 songs from The Yardbirds"". No, there are 13 songs, and some of those are incomplete. It also states a running time of 55 minutes. You get around 40 minutes, and it all goes downhill from there.

This is one of the worst music DVDs I've ever had the displeasure of watching. The back of the DVD states that these are rare performances. That is no excuse for how horrible these videos look and sound, and I almost feel as some of these were sourced from bootleg material. The sound throughout is a bearable to horrible mono, sometimes ruining the entire song. The video quality varies from song to song from very pixelated black and white, to video so blurry you cannot tell the band-mates from each other. There is no excuse for this type of presentation other than to rip of the unwary buyer for 10-15 dollars. This is a great band, and they deserve better treatment than this. It might be worth the price if you found it in the dollar bin, but you'd probably still throw it away after one watch. It is worth watching one time so that you can see that Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck were once young hungry guitarists too.

Here is the listing of the songs:

1. Dazed And Confused (Lots of pixilation and incomplete video)
2. For Your Love
3. Goodnight Sweet Josephine
4. Hang On Sloopy (looks Like it was sourced from a bootleg)
5. Heart Full Of Soul (Terrible Sound)
6. I Wish You Would
7. I'm A Man
8. Louise (Very blurry)
9. Over Under Sideways Down
10. Shape Of Things (Incomplete Performance)
11. Still I'm Sad (Horrible Audio and Video)
12. Train Kept A Rollin'
13. You're A Better Man Than I (Looks like it was sourced from a bootleg. Terrible Audio)

All of these videos are crammed together with no introductions and really no fade out before the next video starts. This collection looks like it could have started life as someone's personal collection from a VHS tape. There are no beginning or end credits, nor any extras. There are better ways to discover The Yardbirds music on video. Do not start with this one.

8490293,1,B0060ANV5U,"Right up front, if these were lost tapes they should have stayed that way. This might be an all right purchase for the diehard Yardbirds collector, but the unwary average DVD purchaser thinking that this will be pristine quality video hits will be sorely disappointed. The video is in full-screen black and white, and at most times the picture is fair, but at some points becomes almost unwatchable and is always pixelated to some degree. The mono sound is mainly fair, but at some spots dips to almost inaudible, overly bassy sound. There are no extras at all on the DVD, which would have been welcome as the disc runs only forty minutes total. Let's get an overview of the Yardbirds at this time in their career, then I'll post the tracklist.

Wikipedia
The Yardbirds are an English rock band that had a string of hits in the mid 1960s, including ""For Your Love"", ""Over Under Sideways Down"" and ""Heart Full of Soul"". The group is notable for having started the careers of three of rock's most famous guitarists: Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page, all of whom were in the top five of Rolling Stone's 100 Top Guitarists list (Clapton as No. 2, Page as No. 3, and Beck at No. 5). A blues-based band that broadened its range into pop and rock, the Yardbirds had a hand in many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s, such as feedback, ""fuzztone"" distortion and improved amplification. Pat Pemberton, writing for Spinner, holds that the Yardbirds were ""the most impressive guitar band in rock music"". After the Yardbirds broke up in 1968, their lead guitarist Jimmy Page founded what became Led Zeppelin.

The bulk of the band's most successful self-written songs came from bassist/producer Paul Samwell-Smith who, with singer/harmonica player Keith Relf, drummer Jim McCarty and rhythm guitarist/bassist Chris Dreja, constituted the core of the group. The Yardbirds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. They were included in Rolling Stone's list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"", and VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"".

The Tracklisting for the DVD is as follows;

2. Shapes Of Things
3. Dazed And Confused (Yes, the future Led Zeppelin mammoth started life here)
4. For Your Love
5. Goodnight Sweet Josephine
6. Over Under Sideways Down
7. Louise (audio is terribly muffled)
8. I'm A Man (Cut off before the end of the song)

11. Heart Full Of Soul (Video quality is horrible)
12. Happenings Ten Years Time Ago

I wish that someday, someone will get it right, and release The Yardbirds concert videos in remastered quality and sound. I would surely buy it. This DVD however, is not going to win anyone over at all. 3/10.",1372032000,2,2846,4.764705882352941
8490294,2,B0060ANV5U,"synchronism of pictures and audio is sometimes really bad!! so it is too expensive, in my opinion.
and what about clapton? he's on the cover-photo but but not in the video.",1350777600,7,172,4.580645161290323
8490295,3,B0060ANV5U,"This is the same footage as contained in the other XXL Media DVD Yardbirds compilation called ""Performances"" with a difference: This new DVD has one less track (12 instead of 13). It also contains ""Happenings Ten Years Time Ago,"" missing from ""Performances."" However, ""Performances"" has ""Still I'm Sad"" and ""You're A Better Man Than I."" If you absolutely need all 14 tracks, you can pick up both sets for cheap. But it'd be better to just rip them from YouTube - where these came from in the first place! - until a more reputable company puts out a definitely anthology.",1348876800,12,570,4.71
8490296,5,B0060ANV5U,"Eric Clapton,Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page all started with the Yardbirds which was a kinda blues influence pop band captured here with 60 s quality (bad photography and sound )clips . Great for nostalgic pop history . On most clips the sound do not match the picture but a keeper for me.",1348790400,7,283,4.461538461538462
8490297,1,B0060ANV5U,"I'm not sure how this DVD got out there. No titles no credits and - while a few of the performances that look like a german TV show are watchable - most look like someone rubbed vasoline over the lens. I can't even recommend this to a Yardbirds completist.

I wasted 40 minutes watching it. Save yourself the time. And thank me for alerting you. ;-)
