Before, During and After: Robert Plant: With and without Zep! Is a 2 DVD collector's box set. This four hour plus product explores the career of one of the most recognisable artists in the history of popular music. Along the journey there is so much more to the `Percy' Plant story than the bare-chested, golden-maned, rock god that is often portrayed at the height of Led Zeppelin fame.
DVD 1 (Robert Plant's Blue Note) introduces us to a pre-Zep Plant and also an expose of the scenes and influences that activated the formation of the Stairway to Heaven stars in 1968. From there Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham went on to become world leaders but by 1980 it would never be the same and a solo career beckoned for the band's frontman.
The decade that followed had Plant drift off in to an almost parallel universe to Duran Duran as his produce stank of that era. In 1994 a reunion with Page had productivity return as he and his old partner recreated Led Zeppelin classics-but, with an eastern tinge. Other work between the dynamic duo followed but by 1998 that chapter had closed. Plant then took on other challenges that have included significant tributes to the musical styles of Africa and Americana. A variety of projects have followed with Strange Sensation, Band of Joy and a fruitful liaison with Alison Krauss being to the fore. However, in to his sixth different decade as an artist and Plant is ever evolving with his trips around the globe wedding a jigsaw of genres.
DVD 2 (Physical Graffiti) has the Zeppelin story at its mid 70's peak as country, folk, funk, rock, blues, instrumental asides and more lead to their masterpiece. The tracks of Physical Graffiti are dissected and once again Zeppelin can claim to be the masters of taking the past and turning in to a pristine present. Their ability to look back and move forward proves to be their ultimate strength. Their ears were also turned to global grooves and as a result their force exacerbated. The mixing pot had an ever increasing supply of tasty ingredients and the likes of the awe inspiring sonic stomp of Kashmir sprung forth! This song is often regarded as the finest Zeppelin achievement amongst their many magical moments and Plant would back this theory.
This purchase does Plant proud and displays that he has many strings to his bow-and, his story is certainly an interesting, multi-faceted tale with an amazing array of chapters.",1443052800,5,2465,4.7546728971962615
8668250,1,B00LULFVIO,Repackaged previously released dvds. Manufactorer does not give details of the titles in box set. Scammed into buying the same dvds again. Critical review Physical Grafitti and Blue note. Led Zeppelin docs are just getting repacked and renamed to rip fans off. Disgusting. Amazon should get more details before listing.,1425686400,6,319,5.4
