I wanted to give this ""no stars"".  This product is an amateurish attempt at a good idea.  Obviously someone with a video camera, took pictures out the car window.  The scenery was not interesting, the camera shots were poor.  The tape gave the impression of starving students, attempting to document a short road trip.  Save your money and make your own. It was one of the worse products I've ever purchased.",1190246400,2,693,6.908045977011494
7949334,1,B00005OWER,If you're looking for a DVD that makes you feel like you're seeing the road ahead from the perspective of riding a bicycle with gorgeous moving scenery try bike-o-vision.  You won't be disappointed.  They're even better than the old VHS tapes put out by Nordic Vision (which was better than this one too) which you can still find a few of them here or elsewhere. Buy this one only if you don't mind being irritated with the interuptions and so forth.,1166313600,,450,4.54320987654321

My question is when are they going to move to DVD?

I'll not purchase another in this series till then.",1139529600,,164,4.433333333333334
7949336,5,B00005OWER,"Easy Cycler is a welcome relief to boring, tedious stationary cycling.  As an avid cyclist, I am pleasantly surprised how much it challenges me.  With the picturesque scenery and easy-to-follow instructional cues, Easy Cycler makes my work-outs far more entertaining and enjoyable, which means I'm actually doing them.  The result? I'm working out more and losing weight!",1112918400,2,371,5.473684210526316
7949337,1,B00005OWER,"I was expecting moving scenery to give me the illusion of cycling through the landscape.  This video is choppy:  a few seconds of moving scenery, then a closeup of a pedaling foot, then a cyclist coming toward you, then from the right, then a still shot of scenery (I'm supposed to be moving, why is the scenery still?)

No continuity.  Gives me no feeling of a journey to distract my mind while my body works.

I'll keep looking.",1106352000,10,430,4.461538461538462
7949338,5,B00005OWER,"This video was really well made.  The terrain used in this video really makes me want to get out and ride.  I especially loved all the warm dry scenery, as I am stuck here in the rainy Northwest.  I liked the added animation and animated reminders, this let me guage my own performance against a scale.  Over-all, this video is an excellent value.  I wish they would make more like this.  The only gripe I have, is that it is not available on DVD.",1098748800,3,447,4.261904761904762
7949339,5,B00005OWER,"This is a great workout video for those who want to lose weight. If you do not want to get a serious workout, this video is not for you. I lost 5 pounds in one week just by following this workout.
The instructor is easy to follow. Even though I did not by this video to learn how to become a professional cyclist, I was pleasantly surprised to pick up some tips on how to become a better cyclist.
The beautiful scenes in the video make me feel like going camping. I may end up losing lots of weight and finally meeting an intelligent and gorgeous man, who makes as much as I do.  We can go camping together.  Yes, I know it is wishful thinking.",1072569600,7,644,4.103174603174603
