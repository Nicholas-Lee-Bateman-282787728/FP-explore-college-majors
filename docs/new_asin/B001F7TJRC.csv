3565986,5,B001F7TJRC,"I had baby number 2 a few months ago and was looking for something to take off that spare tire that appeared with the baby.  I am usually a gym rat, but I can't go to the gym anymore because I have a newborn.  I did a lot of research and I bought this DVD, 30 Minutes to Kickboxing and StepBoxing.  I opened this one first and didn't even bother opening the other ones yet because I love this one so much.  Kelly is tough but awesome and I can already tell a big difference in my abs just from doing the midsection active rests!
Kelly has pleasant personality, but manages to push you really hard.  I never write reviews, but I felt like I had to for this superior workout DVD.",1272758400,7,677,4.098484848484849
3565987,5,B001F7TJRC,This is one of the best video workouts available. Kelly is upbeat and motivating without being saccharin like so many others. Her exercises are a bit modified from the regular ones thus making them more fun and interesting. Putting all of this in a 30 minute workout is great. Plus she has an extra Ab session. This is simply a great buy.,1262822400,,338,4.467741935483871
3565988,5,B001F7TJRC,"I absolutely love this DVD, it keeps my attention, moves along fast and after doing this workout every other day for the past month, I feel great, and see a huge difference all over, especially in my abs....Kelly is a great trainer, gets right in there and doesn't stop at all.  The set and two other people working out are fine.  I switch this off with Kathy Smith's Total Body Lift which uses light to no weights and am getting the results I have been wanting.

The abs section is really intense as you don't stop at all for 10 minutes and she pushes you, but now that I see it changing my body, I look forward to the workout.

I have been working out for a long time, and on some of the lifts I am at the lowest weight.  Definitely a challenge and since you can add weight, a great program.",1256515200,,793,4.1568627450980395
3565989,5,B001F7TJRC,"This was the first workout in fitness instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer's new 30 Minutes to Fitness series. Like the other DVDs in this series, 30 Minutes to Fitness Weights offers two separate splits-style workouts; when combined with the warm-up, each of these workouts is approximately 30 minutes long, perfect if you are short on time. However, additional options allow you to create a longer workout as well as to add in lots of variety (described below).

Kelly works out with two background exercises, one of whom shows modifications for some of the exercises. The Main Menu of the DVD lists the Warm-Up, Workout 1, Workout 2, Workout Sections, and Premixes; there are also audio options for working out with music or with Kelly's voice only. In her introduction, Kelly explains that the workouts are designed for heavier lifting.  She recommends that beginners use 5 lbs., intermediate 7 lbs., and advanced 10 lbs. (note that these weight amounts are different than what is is listed on the DVD menu).  I found these amounts to be about right, as I consider myself to be high intermediate, and I used 8 lbs. through the majority of both workouts, sometimes pyramiding up to 10 lbs.

The basic 3-minute warm-up includes marches, taps with reaches, side steps, and hamstring curls.  Without the warm-up, Workout #1, which focuses on Back, Legs, & Chest, is 29.5 minutes long, and Workout #2, concentrating on Biceps, Triceps, & Shoulders, is 27 minutes long. Both workouts follow the same general format:  a single exercise consisting of 8 repetitions is performed for each of the three targeted body parts.  This round is then repeated once, and then you take an ""active rest.""  The active rests are 1-minute periods of standing ab work; these are fast-paced and hardly feel like a ""rest,"" but they're a fun break from the strength work.  Two more strength rounds and two more rest periods follow, and then there's just a few very brief stretches to finish.  Kelly moves quickly from exercise to exercise in both workouts--don't be surprised if your heart rate stays up the whole time.  As always, she adds a lot of unique twists to to the exercises, such as hesitation holds, deadlifts with a twist, and some challenging push-up/plank moves.  She also manages to sneak in additional strength work during the so-called rests (ie, one of the rests includes plies to work the legs).

The Premixes on this DVD provide a great amount of variety to the workouts.  The first four premixes feature the workouts exactly as above, with the only changes being to the active rest portions.  For the first two premixes, the active rest portions in both workouts are replaced by 2 minutes of floor abdominal work (exercises include leaning rows with lifts, knee tuck crunches, full sit-ups with arm reaches, frog-leg crunches, and side leg crunches).  For the next two premixes, the active rest portions in both workouts are replaced by low-cardio segments, including simple moves such as v-steps, knee repeaters, side-steps, hamstring pulls, toe taps, and lunges.  Each of these premixes remains about 30 minutes in length.

There are also three additional premixes as follows:
Full Body--1 rotation of each exercise (38m)
Mixed Full Body Blast--no active rests (41m)
Time-Saver Full Body Blast--2 exercises each body part w/no rests (31m)

As with the other DVDs in her 30 Minutes to Fitness series, Kelly did a great job in this video, which provides users with plenty of workout options. Overall, I give this 4 1/2 stars!",1233187200,5,3515,4.977777777777778
3565990,5,B001F7TJRC,This is a great workout.  I do Jari Love videos most of the time and this was a great change.  There are many options offered; you can use it in a time crunch or pick a longer workout.  The video was shipped in a reasonable amount of time.,1229040000,,239,3.9375
3565991,5,B001F7TJRC,"If you like heavy weights, this workout is for you! Without looking closer one might think this DVD has only a 30-minute workout. Not so. The main components are: 30 minutes legs/chest/back, 30 minutes bi/tri/shoulders, ab section, 2 different warmups and stretch. Additionally, there are several different premixes, some of them using standing ab routines as 'rest' periods in-between the weight sections, others using cardio in-between. You get a complete body workout with lots of variety on this awesome DVD. All along Kelly encourages to go as heavy with your weight as you can handle. The time just flew by for me. I love it!",1224115200,10,631,5.019047619047619
3565992,5,B001F7TJRC,"This is a great dvd.  There are a few different options to it, so you can make it a different workout all of the time.  I have only done 2 of the premixes so far (back-to-back)...but felt that I got a very good workout.",1223769600,,219,3.9545454545454546
3566003,5,B001F7TJRC,I am liking this workout.  I have done day 1 and day 2 twice so far and I am still surprised when the workout ends.  I recommend this to anyone who likes to workout with weights.,1481500800,2,178,3.9166666666666665
3566004,5,B001F7TJRC,"I absolutely love Kelly Coffey-Meyer workout style and motivation.  I was looking for a straight-forward weight training workout dvd and investigated them on Amazon.  I had never heard of Kelly Coffey-Meyer, so when her workouts came up during my search on Amazon, I watched this one on YouTube to see if she had a personality and workout I would like.  I liked what I saw and ordered this workout.  I loved it so much, that I ordered a weight bench so I could do it efficiently.  The is a straight-forward motivating, fun workout with no weird contortionist moves.  I loved Kelly's style so much that I investigated more of her workouts and watched them first on YouTube.  Since ordering this workout, I've bought 7 more of her workouts.  Her instruction is clear, fun and engaging.  I would recommend her workouts to anyone that wants a fun, efficient workout.",1479772800,5,862,4.77027027027027

3566007,4,B001F7TJRC,I enjoy this very. Much there aren't as many alignment cues as I think would be helpful for the rank beginner. That's the only reason I'm giving 4 stars. Really nice to have a heavy lift video.,1472083200,,193,4.243243243243243

3566010,3,B001F7TJRC,"I'm actually surprised that its too easy for me. I've been doing Cathe Freidrich's workouts for a while but wanted something different (and quick for weeknights). This is a straight forward quick workout, but not challenging for me at all. Not enough reps means not enough parts worked..  this would be good for someone starting out. I'll probably be giving this one away.",1465516800,,372,4.904761904761905

If you follow her direction and work hard,  there is no question that you will get the results you desire.  There are some other instructors out there that make everything about themselves.  Not KCM - she's the real deal.",1462233600,2,333,4.559322033898305

3566038,5,B001F7TJRC,"This is my first KCM and I love it! Great cuing, great personality, and she incorporates a few exercises you don't commonly see in a lot of strength training DVDs. She uses heavier weights, but you can use whatever weight challenges you. And many workout options to choose from! Its an awesome value!",1444003200,,300,4.679245283018868
3566039,5,B001F7TJRC,"I have been looking for a weight-training video that is simple and in the 30 minute range. I am a cardio queen, but I have never been able to stick with a weight-training routine so I needed a video to get me on track. I currently have a torn meniscus in both knees, so I figure now is the time to work on some strength training.

This video is divided into two 30-minute segments. One segment is for chest, shoulders, back and the other focuses on arms and legs. The trainer is definitely a no-nonsense type and she moves through the exercises quickly. There is little explanation as to how to do the moves, but it is easy to pick up. The exercises in this video are the tried and true basic ones you see people doing in the weight room of the gym such as flys, rows, push-ups, etc.

You do need either a weight bench or a step to do a lot of these exercises, in addition to several sized weights. I am currently using a set of 5lb and a set of 8lb weights but I definitely need some 8's and 10's to get the most out of these workouts. I like the simplicity of these workouts and the fact that the trainer, Kelly Coffey-Meyer, does not waste time with silly comments. In one workout, she does ""introduce"" the viewer to her crew but it is fast and painless. (I can't abide the exercise videos where the trainer constantly chats with and/or corrects the form of her fellow exercises.)

Overall, I like this weight-training video better than any of the others I have tried. It offers basic exercises without a lot of fuss. There are no exercises with ""compound moves,"" which seem to be popular these days but I think anyone who uses this video consistently will see positive changes. In addition to the two 30-minute segments, there are also several premixed sessions including two full body workouts and some ab work. The music is painful but you do have the option of turning that off, which I highly recommend. I have high hopes for this video keeping me motivated and getting me in shape.",1439251200,24,1990,4.4021739130434785
3566040,3,B001F7TJRC,"Trying desparately to fall in love with this workout but it's not happening.  Nothing wrong with the exercises or Kelly (who I adore), it's just not my favorite format of hers.  It might just be me. Watch the clips before you buy.",1439164800,2,230,4.4523809523809526
3566041,5,B001F7TJRC,"I love this workout.  I also have Split Sessions and Home Gym Intervals.  I love them all.  I just ordered the Healthy Back video by her also.  She is a great trainer.  Nothing you have to be an acrobat to do, and it doesn't get boring.",1438128000,,236,4.043478260869565

3566046,5,B001F7TJRC,Good strength training workout for when you don't have time to do a time consuming and intense workiut. It was just your basic exercises but very good .,1435449600,,152,4.464285714285714
3566047,5,B001F7TJRC,"Love this workout! It has two 30 minute sections plus the usual premixes so it's easy to progress and not get bored. The Ab section is merciless, but works. Kelly gets you through without being loud or in your face. She gets the job done without fluff.",1434672000,,252,4.382978723404255
3566048,5,B001F7TJRC,I love these workouts.  I usually combine the two and make it a total body workout.  It seems to have really helped me get more muscle toned again after mainly doing cardio.  Each workout is only 30 minutes...that includes your warm up & cool down.  Get your heavy weights ready.,1434499200,,279,4.52
3566049,5,B001F7TJRC,"This is just what I was looking for.  I wanted a straight up, no nonsense serious lifting DVD.  No dancing or cardio (although this does get my heart rate up).  I wanted something to do after my runs in the morning.  I am 47 years old and I know that it is very important to build muscle at this age.  I am also trying to lose weight and running alone isn't cutting it.  I like this workout because you are encouraged to lift heavy (duh!) and the sets all flow nicely.  No complicated, combination moves.  Just good ole' fashioned lifting.  I have several of KCM DVDs and, as usual, the music sucks but thank goodness her workouts are good because after a while I don't notice the bad music.  I will start wearing my ear buds and listen to my own music as soon as I get the routine down.",1434326400,29,787,4.1866666666666665
3566050,5,B001F7TJRC,"Good workout DVD!!  Wow, can you work up a sweat with these dumbbell workouts.  She explains everything so we will do it properly and avoid injury.  Great dumbbell workout.  Would recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge.",1433462400,3,227,4.894736842105263
3566051,4,B001F7TJRC,"Good workout and enjoyable other then too much switching from bench to upright positions. I'm using a stepper for a bench and have some back issues so have to reinvent the exercises a bit to compensate. I'm out of shape, in my 50's and am able to keep up with the workout.  Would say it's a beginners video but then I purchased target toning 10 minute workout for beginners and it's far too easy and believe me when I say I'm in need of a tune up.",1432857600,5,447,4.137931034482759

3566053,4,B001F7TJRC,The exercises push me work up my weights and work hard which I love.  But the premixed sets are not edited well so sometimes the opposite side does not get worked on a given exercise although it is correct on other mixes.  Not a deal breaker for me but may be for others.,1428624000,3,271,4.09433962264151
3566054,5,B001F7TJRC,I have several of Kelly's workout DVDs and I love them all with the exception of Step boxing.  Lift 2B Fit does not have the cardio intervals which is a really nice change! The moves are simple yet really effective and you will feel like you got a great workout when you are done.  Just be sure to use heavy enough weights. You do need a step or weight bench for some of the exercises. I have a good quality step but you could use a sturdy coffee table with a mat on top if you don't want to purchase more equipment.,1427414400,6,516,4.049019607843137

8301227,4,B001F7TJRC,"This was my first Kelly Coffey video, and at first, it seemed really subdued, compared to the Beginner Shred that I was doing with Jillian Michaels. Kelly's approach is much more low-key and no-fuss. It grew on me, and I like it. I like most of the exercises and it really does give a whole body workout. I wanted a video that focused on strength training with no cardio, and this one does it. I haven't done it long enough to see full results, but after a couple weeks, I feel like I am stronger. I only dropped one star because I can't hear the music on mine. It's very muted, and I would've liked to hear it better and have it enhance the exercise.",1496448000,2,651,4.216

8301229,5,B001F7TJRC,"Another good video from Kelly. This is the kind of workout you would do at the gym, period. She uses super sets and the time goes quickly. There is really no cardio to speak of, so if you want that, you won't get it here. You do move through things with little rest, but it's not high rep training. She uses a bench (or stepper) for chest and one back exercise. I don't have that at home, so I just did them on the floor. It does reduce the range of motion, but you can still perform the move (basic chest press, chest fly, lat pull over). A stability ball would likely work, too.",1493251200,3,580,4.0964912280701755

I really like that I can vary how hard the workout is by changing the weight and pausing to include more sets and reps. Have been using for almost a month and can see very good results: strength and muscle tone. Right now, this is my go to 4-5 days per week and I plan to buy more of Kelly's DVD to add to my routine. This may now work for you if you're highly advanced in weight training but if you've been out of training for a few years (like myself) this is a great foundation for picking it back up.",1488326400,5,630,4.048
