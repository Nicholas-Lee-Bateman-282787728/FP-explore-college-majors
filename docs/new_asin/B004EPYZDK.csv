4347369,3,B004EPYZDK,"This was a good (not a great) and timely movie. The cast of William Hurt as Hank Paulson (Treasury Secretary), Paul Giamatti as Ben Bernanke (Chairman of the Federal Reserve), Ed Asner as Warren Buffett, Billy Crudup as Tim Geithner (President of New York Fed), James Woods as Dick Fuld (CEO/Lehman Brothers), Mathew Modine as John Thain (CEO/Merrill Lynch), Ajay Mehta as Vikram Pandit (CEO/Citigroup), Bill Pullman as Jamie Dimon (CEO/JPMorgan), Tony Shalhoub as John Mack (CEO/Morgan Stanley), Evan Handler as Lloyd Blankfein (CEO/ Goldman Sachs), Ayad Akhtar as Neel Kashkari (Asst. Secretary for International Economics and Development), Cynthia Nixon as Michele Davis (Asst. to the Secretary of the Treasury for Public Affairs and Director of Policy Planning), Topher Grace as Jim Wilkinson (Paulson's Chief of Staff) Michael O'Keefe as Chris Flowers (Bank takeover expert) and Peter Hermann as Christopher Cox (Chairman of the SEC), was first rate.

That said however, the plot prodded along even though it was clear that ""we the audience"" already knew the outcome and what would become the horrible punch line. While the financial meltdown was a difficult subject to turn into a movie script, having great acting made it less painful and more interesting. But in order to do so, the director was forced to ""spoon-feed"" the audience on the intricacies of the financial system to keep them in the loop of understanding. In doing so, they also were careful to remain politically neutral, even though responsibility and blame could have been attributed to one party and one President.

I personally hate movies that fake political neutrality when reality calls for assessing blame and assigning responsibility. I also hate movies that create dialogue to do the thinking for the audience (and then spoon feed it back to us): that is dialogue designed solely to ensure that the audience ""gets it."" However, in this case the screenwriters and the director didn't seem to have much of a choice? Even so, as we were being carefully led around by our noses we still only knew what one of the actors was thinking: Hank Paulson, as his soliloquy although devoid of any moral culpability, did help connect the dots.

Ben Bernanke came off being the conscience of the high-level financial cabal of bankers, FDIC director, hedgefund managers, and Federal Reserve Chairman. Even with heavy-handed ""coaching,"" the plot still was a hard sell. It was uneven, had lots of dead spots, claimed moral and political neutrality, and then came to a most unsatisfactory conclusion: With Tim Geithner predicting that because of lack of stronger regulations, it would just be a matter of time before the meltdown would happens again?

It would have helped, to have shown the impact that the meltdown had on ""real (common) people."" The whole world of the financial manipulators just seemed such a compartmentalized abstraction that it was difficult to connect it to the system of morality and legality of which normal people are a part?  As a result, the acts that caused the crash seemed to have existed in another dimension, a realm wholly removed from the people it hurt.

Somehow, I kept saying to myself, if Michael Moore had written the film script, then this may have been a better movie. Three stars.",1306713600,12,3286,5.064695009242144
4347370,5,B004EPYZDK,"HBO has produced a marvelous film with spot-on acting from the book by Andrew Ross Sorkin.  Although this is ""old news"" to those of us who followed the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, it is presented concisely and clearly.
  Some facts to ponder:
  1. The federal government's bailout to the banks was to enable them to continue lending.  This did not happen as the banks did NOT lend to consumers.
  2. Wall Street bankers are sociopathologically greedy.  Their incomes have increased to record highs even though they did NOT lend and did NOT help the American economy to rebound.
  3. High finance is not brain surgery.  The ""best and the brightest"" are found in occupations (and service professions) unrelated to, and far from, the mindset on Wall Street.

Grammatical notes:  In English, the correct verb form is ""to lend,"" not ""to loan.""  ""Loan"" is a noun.
  In English, we buy a ""house,"" which is the building.  We live in a ""home,"" which is the  environment, sense of ease and familiarity, that we create in the building. One can buy a house.  One cannot buy a home.

Apparently finance majors are not taught proper word use of their native language, as well as any kind of business ethics.",1306368000,6,1203,4.660287081339713
4347371,5,B004EPYZDK,"I am a market freak.  I am very distrustful of the Bigs--big government (BG), big corporations (BC), and big unions.  I was very opposed to TARP.  I had my doubts about ""too big to fail.""  It seemed to me to be a bailout of the mistakes of BG and BCs.  HBO's movie is an incredibly good production of the inside story of what happened.  In a sense, I was right and wrong.  BG and BC did screw up royally.  But I now realize that that is irrelevant to a large extent.  Given the situation they found themselves in, did they have to do TARP?  I am at least open now to the possibility that the US and global economies might have melted down if we did not.

The film does not help on the key policy question of how to avoid future crises.  But one cannot help but be sickened by the corruption of BG and BC.  My hostility for BG and BC deepened, but I realize that was a separate question of whether TARP was necessary.  The fact that no one has gone to jail for putting the US in this position is very disappointing.  The film proves that we have no accountability for government officials.  Thus I am pushed further into believing that we need to get government out of the economy and make it clear that government will not bail out corporations.  Predictable, yes.  But as Heller points out in Catch 22, ""Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you.""

HBO has done a magnificent service to America with this film.  We need to understand its lessons.  We have many crises that we must address in the future and the American people are fed up with the complicity of the Bigs.",1306281600,16,1593,4.3141891891891895
4347372,4,B004EPYZDK,"HBO has come up with another controversial film that contains views that all of us should ponder.  TOO BIG TO FAIL is based on the very long book by Andrew Ross Sorkin that stunned the country with its moment by moment details of how the financial meltdown of 2008 when at the end of President Bush's term the powerful battle between the backs and lending institutions of Wall Street imploded requiring a government bailout to avert a global financial disaster.  The story was adapted for the screen by Peter Gould and directed at breakneck speed by Curtis Hanson, allowing the public to not only see the institutions involved in this scandal but also introduce the players from all parts of the battlefield disclosing details we did not know and the gradual history of the financial mess that had been brewing at the public's expense for years.

The film is populated with major actors portraying the big names and while there are clips of President Bush, Warren Buffet and others taken form the CNN newsreels, the big names in the film include such extremely memorable performances  as William Hurt as Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Billy Crudup as Federal Reserve of NY President Timothy Geithner, Paul Giamati as Ben Bernanke, Topher Grace as Paulson's Chief of Staff Jim Wilkinson, James Wood as Lehman Brothers CEO Dick Fuld, Matthew Modine as CIT CEO John Thain, Tony Shalhoub as CEO of Morgan Stanley  John Mack, Bill Pullman as CEO of JP Morgan Chase Jamie Dimon, Ed Asner as Warren Buffett, Victor Slezak as CEO of Bank of America Greg Curl, Ajay Mehta as CEO of Citigroup Vikram Pandit, Michael O'Keefe as JC Flowers, as Barney Frank of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mack scandal, Nancy Pelosi as Nancy Pelosi, and Cynthia Nixon as the PR for Paulson Michele Davis.

Each member of this huge cast plays very well, with special kudos to William Hurt, Billy Crudup, and James Wood.  Each character is believable but the problem with the film is that it moves past our eyes so quickly with fleeting identifiers of who each actor is portraying that it is next to impossible to keep the players straight.  There is a lot of information and so many board meetings and long work hours that even though the viewer an appreciate the rising calamity and the impact it has globally, it at times becomes word soup.  Even the film's opening credits pack so much information so quickly that we are dizzy before the story starts.  Is that a problem with the film or with our lack of insider information of how we came so close to the biggest financial disaster since the Great Depression? Probably both. Perhaps multiple screenings of this film will allow the audience to catch up tot he speed of what is truly a remarkable docudrama of a harrowing time for this country and the world.  It is very much worth spending time with this terrifying movie.  Grady Harp, May 11",1306195200,23,2865,4.719438877755511

4347524,5,B004EPYZDK,"Great cast! Nice insight to the collapse of the big banks, or their 'near failure.' One can learn a lot from this movie. But one thing I've questioned when this occurred is why didn't the gov't bail the people out and NOT the banks?

Nice to see things that were happening in the background that most of us did not know about during this time when the stock market tanked.  What was interesting was the text at the end of the movie: The government gave $125 billion through the TARP program to nine major banks expecting them to distribute the funds for loans, and instead they (Wall Street) gave themselves a record $135 billion in compensation (executive bonuses included) even though bigger banks repaid the government later, but the market continued to tumble and unemployment reached 10%.

(after all the Fed, not Treasury, is the ""LENDER OF LAST RESORT""). I think the ENTIRE DEFICIT the Treasury took on in 2009 ($ 1 Trillion ON TOP OF ""usual"" $400 Bn, can you believe it) should have been shouldered by the Fed (which ALSO increased ITS balance sheet by another trillion) and NOT the taxpayer via Treasury.

Because the Treasury shouldered the deficit, this meant that the private sector had to CONTRACT as Treasury lowered the deficit over time! And to this, economists have been moaning about the ""slow recovery"". well, DUH! what did you expect having to amortize a trillion dollar deficit via taxpayers.  I always thought Andrew Ross Sorkin was a bit too flash and a tool, but he has done a VERY creditable job here, despite NOT exploring the real skulduggery of Treasury and Fed splitting the burden at a trillion each, when it should have been Fed alone!",1482624000,,991,4.722543352601156

With the presidential election in the upcoming future, it is important you keep events like this in mind so that you know why it is important you have someone who can make the right choice and decision in a hard time even if it isn't the best choice.
We here the term ""Too bog to fail"" a lot now with banks and wall street being in the news every week and more and more people looking at what happend in 2008 and what could have been differently.
The only thing that was difficult about this movie was keeping some of the banks straight and remebering who they where due to the fact they where introduced once and didn't have role that left you connecting with them one a personal level or anything.

4350479,4,B004EPYZDK,"Excellent but incomplete if you want to know why the crisis happened. ""Money for Nothing"" as well as the four PBS ""Frontline"" Money, Power, and Wall Street episodes will tell you why it happened. The language, like most of modern productions, is unnecessarily obscene. Still this was better than the wretched, ""The Big Short"", which was overloaded with of the obscene gutter argot of the millennial generation.",1470009600,,410,5.134328358208955
4350480,4,B004EPYZDK,This and the big short need to be shown to every American so they can understand the greed and the ineptitude exhibited by Wall Street and I suspect that they still haven't learned. I sincerely hope that Bernie will get Hillery to do something seriously.,1469923200,,254,4.666666666666667

4350684,2,B004EPYZDK,"I can't even say  that it looked like a cheap, TV movie because I must say that TV movies have come a long way.

4351165,5,B004EPYZDK,"A tough subject but technically well done.  Also liked the non-administration judgement side of it.  As it should have been.  Too easy to blame a president when congress and regulators are totally to blame.  I don't routinely like the ""blame"" aspect but in this case the watchers should have been escalated in the public eye if not prosecuted.  But not good for any administration or political party.  This was handled very well, for those paying attention.  Why Barnie Frank is not in jail escapes me but that is too much of an opinion.  Well done from a documentary perspective.  We were all appropriately frightened by our government.",1468195200,,637,4.878504672897196
4351166,2,B004EPYZDK,"I stopped watching after maybe 15 minutes.  Too much like a poorly done documentary, but with great actors!  It did not flow.

Maybe I'll try to sit through it all some time later.",1468108800,,326,4.551724137931035
4351167,5,B004EPYZDK,It is a complex topic here and you have to pay extra attention to the dialogue to stay with it at times. I also enjoyed that Wells Fargo was not in trouble but they made it take bail out money to disguise the bad banks from the good.  Also interesting that the EU would not let Barclays save Lehman Bros.,1468108800,,304,4.066666666666666

4355464,5,B004EPYZDK,"I'm an economist (Yale) and former banker (Wall Street, well Pine Street). Perforce they skipped over some components of the crisis, and limited the number of central actors. But the core story was frightfully well done, and I think conveyed how close to the edge things got. It provided a sense of the complexity of markets, how even those at the top of the profession such as Paulson could be blindsided, and at how Paulson, Bernanke, Geithner and others took seriously the legal constraints that limited what they could do.

Now if the acting and book hadn't been good, I would have loved it but few others. But the characters were well drawn (though the only one I've met was Bernanke) and the acting good, even stellar. The story remained coherent and dramatic, a good adaptation for the big screen (well, Amazon Prime on a 55"" or some such). I suspect it's not an easy watch for those with no interest in finance and untouched by the Great Recession. Our aging population (and for new college grads, the structure of the labor market) mean there are a lot more people interested in finance than a decade ago, and unfortunately all too many of us were touched by (or beaten senseless by) the events that came to their denouement in fall 2008.",1462579200,,1247,4.642533936651584
