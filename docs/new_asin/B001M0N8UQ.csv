8320277,5,B001M0N8UQ,"One might expect this news material to become quickly dated.  But some of it is timeless, as it deals graphically with ongoing problems.  Witness the brief reference to Boco Harem.  That movement is even more significant to day than it was at the time.
An excellent example of in depth, behind the scenes journalism made graphic and interesting.",1406851200,,345,4.913793103448276
8320278,5,B001M0N8UQ,For that more you can expect from the very serious and professional journalist Anderson Cooper. Simply the best information to keep up to date with the reality in which we are living. The DVD came in perfect condition and it was sent by eager willingness.,1264723200,,255,4.688888888888889
8320279,3,B001M0N8UQ,"This is the second of CNN's new documentaries on the global environmental situation.  The first is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-in-Peril/dp/B0013D8LHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet in Peril</a>.  This documentary is more interesting than the first because it does a better job of getting down to real life in foreign countries about what environmental problems mean.  The story on the factory in Peru sadly could duplicated all over the Third World.  The section on the mass murder of the African elephants was truly appalling even by the standards of somebody like myself who has studied environmental destruction for over 20 years.  I have a Listmania list on my profile of documentaries on environmental problems if people want to see more material like this.",1244332800,2,819,6.025862068965517
8320280,5,B001M0N8UQ,"Excellent documentary. Only negative was Lisa was a little self absorbed but the guys were right on facts, and stayed on point and moved along with their segment. Everyone should watch it and give as gifts to help spread the word about the dangers. Great footage.",1229126400,,263,4.739130434782608
8320281,5,B001M0N8UQ,"I just finished watching this on TV on CNN and I cannot explain how I feel, only that everyone should see it to experience it and come to his/her own conclusion.  It was very well done and gave insight into the many atrocities which plague our planet, and that the main reason the planet is in such peril is caused by one species alone, the human species.  I will certainly get this as a gift for my children. Hopefully, this documentary will bring about changes; if it doesn't, we will be the species to be in peril.",1229126400,2,517,4.319587628865979
