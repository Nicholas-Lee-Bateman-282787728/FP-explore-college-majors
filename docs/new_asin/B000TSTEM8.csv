2909854,2,B000TSTEM8,"I tend to agree with the last reviewer (except for the boycott part).  With this latest collection WB has gone too far in trying to cater to the animation historians, and not far enough to please the average fans who sustain these releases with their mass purchasing power.  An entire disc of pre-1942 cartoons (only 2 of which were made in the 40s) is nothing but an expensive coaster for all but a small handful of hard-core fans and animation historians, and the Bob Clampett disc isn't much better.  On top of that, they tossed in 5 more boring oldies on the second disc, making this year's Golden Collection a good buy for die-hard Looney Tunes fans/historians only.  If you're one of the millions who tuned in to the Bugs Bunny/Roadrunner Show (and later, the Bugs and Tweety Show) every Saturday morning in a bygone era, you're probably going to want to skip the golden Collection this year and buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes-Spotlight-Collection-Vol-5/dp/B000TSTEMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes: Spotlight Collection, Vol. 5</a>&nbsp;instead.  It includes the first 2 discs of the Golden collection, which contain all of the Golden Collection Volume 5's cartoons that were shown in rotation on Saturday mornings, but at less than half of the price.

2909855,5,B000TSTEM8,"The excellent new Popeye collection has a commercial for this set at the beginning of disc 4. Probably most of you have seen those horrid hand colored versions of the black-and-white Looney Tunes released to television in the 1970's--the versions that wiped out all the detail and look like something your four-year-old nephew would do.  When I saw three clips that obviously came from those Koreacolor monstrosities, I started to wonder... ""It can't be, can it?"" Fortunately, NO. All black-and-white shorts are presented in their original glory. And since I'd seen some of these in fuzzy TV prints before, it's a delight to see them in crisp video and sound. Check out in particular ""Wholly Smoke"" and ""Scrap Happy Daffy."" Happy viewing! [revised from original]",1191456000,2,762,5.096
2909856,4,B000TSTEM8,"Does anyone know if each collection will not duplicate cartoons? I hope they put out all the cartoons with modern homes, modern cars, etc. I will keep collecting hoping to attain all my favorites.
thanks",1187913600,,203,4.828571428571428
2909857,5,B000TSTEM8,"We classic Looney Tunes fans will, naturally, forever debate which cartoons WB should include on each set.  But what impresses me about Vol. 5 is that there is a little more variety spread out over the discs.  I mean, there's no point arguing the merits of a classic Bugs Bunny cartoon. . .but I've seen them all many times before.  I'm more interested in seeing the early stuff (Disc 4) or some of the lesser-known but brilliant work like the Fairy Tale 'toons (Disc 2).

Warner Bros. has set the gold standard (pardon the pun) for extras, and Vol. 5 is no exception.  As a lifelong Chuck Jones fan, I've had ""Inbetween & Extremes"" for years, but the single-disc documentary by itself costs about half the price of one of these Golden Collections. . .so it's a good thing to have.  I expect the casual viewer doesn't care all that much about having more Private Snafu cartoons, but I think they've VERY important parts of both animation history and American history, for that matter.

Looney Tunes fans, though fickle as ever when picking their favorites, at least seem to be a fiercely loyal bunch in supporing each new Golden Collection DVD release.  As I said in my review for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes-Golden-Collection-Volume-Four/dp/B000HC2LGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume Four</a>, we've still got a long way to go.

2909858,5,B000TSTEM8,"Looney Tunes Golden Collection 5 is another great collection. Lots of fan favorites and lesser-known but memorable classic WB cartoons are here. These are my top ten choices for LTGC VOL.5.

A Tale of Two Kitties : This is one of Robert Clampett's best cartoons. This and A GRUESOME TWOSOME are Clampett's Tweety-themed cartoons at its finest.

Porky's Review : Tex Avery's classic porky cartoon. Avery's genius really shines in this one. Cartoon within a cartoon drawn by porky himself is a inventive, unique cartoon storytelling and pure Avery.

The Bear's Tale : Another Avery classic. Not well-known but certainly first rate Avery cartoon for sure. I hope LTGC vol. 6 will have Tex Avery disc next year. Next year is Tex Avery's 100th year birth anniversary. I don't understand why one of animation histories greatest directors still don't have his own disc after five volumes of LTGC sets.

The Daffy Doc : top-rated Clampett daffy classic. Surrealistic, incredibly funny. Clampett demonstrates his true talents here.

Ali Baba Bunny : Well-known Chuck Jones cartoon. This cartoon partly shown from BUGS BUNNY'S THIRD MOVIE:1001 RABBIT TALES but this time we'll see its uncut,restored version.

Scrap Happy Daffy : One of Frank Tashlin's best cartoons. Pure anarchic, perfectly drawn masterpiece.

Hare Ribbin' : Yes, we can see uncut director's version of Hare Ribbin' finally. What a great news for every classic cartoon fans, I can't wait.

Porky's Pooch : Another black and white Porky classic. WB really did great job bringing old black and white porky classics into life. Now, I'm very happy if Tex Avery's porky masterpiece PORKY THE WRESTLER will be releasing next year for LTGC VOL.6.

Trial of Mr. Wolf : Very underrated Fritz Freleng classic. Unique concept brilliantly realised by Freleng's craftsmanship. One of a kind.

A Pest in the House : One of Chuck Jones finest masterpieces finally releasing dvd. Incredibly funny, fast paced classic, Maybe DUCK AMUCK, WHAT'S OPERA, DOC had more vote from classic cartoon fans, but A PEST IN THE HOUSE is my choice for Chuck Jones funniest cartoon. Hysterical from start to finish, don't miss it.

These are my top ten favorites from upcoming LTGC vol. 5. Thanks for reading.",1186358400,58,2235,5.062670299727521
2909859,5,B000TSTEM8,"True to the schedule and quantity of cartoons, Warner Bros. is releasing the Fifth Volume of Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies Golden Collection right on time. These have been such a joy to look forward to each year around Halloween. I do hope the minimal of 10 volumes contines to be carried out. I recently heard there's a prospect of 17 if Warner Bros. decides to release all 489 Looney Tunes and all 518 Merrie Melodies cartoons.

With this collection, there seems to be more instored for the Looney Tunes fan with more TV specials and documentaries than any other previous collection has held so far. I'm pleased to see a whole disc being dedicated to Bob Clampett as well. There were some previous concerns that not enough of his stuff was shown in the second and third collections, but it seems Warner Bros. is making up for that here.

It is hard to find in other collections, and so I have several reviewers to Thank for verifying that it was in this particular set.  The older we get (72) the more we enjoy the older cartoons.  The stuff on NICKTOONS and on Cartoon network are so poorly drawn, it is no wonder that kids today might wind up with a skewed view of the world  or at least the people in it.  As a kid, I enjoyed these cartoons because the animals and people looked REAL, and actually acted more like real people  not razor-edged-modern-art-#@%&!*.

They put way too many old ones on these DVDs that were rarely (if ever) shown on TV due to the topic they covered (not politically correct today) or because the cartoon was just plain bad.  I honestly think that Looney Tunes could have put all of the BEST on one or two Volumes instead of spreading them out over 5 or 6 volumes.  I guess this is how they force you to spend more money and buy them all.

2909966,5,B000TSTEM8,"Finally, Bob Clampett gets his due in these sets.  Disc 3 is all Bob Clampett cartoons, 15 in all, plus scattered throughout the other discs are 6 more early Clampetts and 6 Tex Avery's.  For my money, Bob Clampett was the best Warner Brothers toon director.  His stories are the best, the animation is the most creative, the characters are the best drawn and developed, the voice characterizations the best, and the gags are fast and furious and avoid the repetitiveness I find in Jones and Freleng's work.  Clampett pitched his cartoons to adults with as much sly innuendo as he could get away with.  His animation crew, notably with the great Rod Scribner, stretched the form and animated the living heck out of his stories.  Clampett's toons are all about the laugh, and anything and everything is fair game.

Every director at Warner Brothers Termite Terrace turned out classic toons.  I find the earlier work of Jones and Freleng much better than the later when they went for highly stylized backgrounds, minimalist characterization and animation.  I was gratified to find that most of the commentators are also fans of Clampett.  This is the set to buy to get a fair comparison.  Clampett's toons are rich with detail and just laugh out loud funny as hell. A cross between Avery's zaniness and Jones' craftmanship, they are all out cartooney, as they should be, and guided by a young director who was full of life and full of beans and his cartoons reflect that sensibility.",1362355200,,1481,4.791338582677166

I even remember the day it came out, in Amazon's best-seller DVD list it was all the way down at 290-something, while that overrated CGI talking-animal film ""Ratatouille"" (from long-time Warner Bros. rival Pixar) was already crushing the competition! This set's bombing led to the unfortunate discontinuation of the series with Volume 6 the following year.

But enough mourning. This set has some of my favorite LT cartoons on it: ""Transylvania 6-5000,"" ""Stupor Duck,"" ""The Up-Standing Sitter,"" ""Paying the Piper,"" ""Little Red Walking Hood,"" ""The Trial of Mr. Wolf,"" ""The Turn-Tale Wolf,"" ""Senorella and the Glass Huarache,"" ""Bacall to Arms,"" ""Porky's Double Trouble"" and ""Wholly Smoke.""

2909985,5,B000TSTEM8,"I'm typically several years late when it comes to purchasing the Golden Collection series and this one's no exception. I purchased this a few days ago and it arrived yesterday. Thanks to the availability of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes-Spotlight-Collection-Vol-5/dp/B000TSTEMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes: Spotlight Collection, Vol. 5</a>&nbsp;I was able, several years ago, to see 30 of the cartoons that are featured in this edition of the Golden Collection.

As usual the Golden Collection is aimed more at the cartoon enthusiasts...the animation historians...and die-hard fans of the Looney Tunes. The main reason for the Spotlight Collections were to aim at the general audience and aim at those who wouldn't pay more than $20.00 for a DVD collection (although the Golden Collections are well worth the higher price). A lot of the reviews of this DVD I've not read (there's too many) but those that I've skimmed through touch base on just about everything and so I'm not going to do any break downs of individual cartoons.

This Volume Five nearly completes my collection of the series...I now need to get the final volume, Six, to make it complete.

Given that the Golden Collection, this one being no exception, are filled with extra features and mini-documentaries on animators, directors, and the like I watched most of the extra features and bonus material first and that's what this review will mostly be about.

The documentary I watched right away was ""Drawn To Life: The Art of Robert McKimson"" which is found on disc 2. I watched this first because I wanted to, first of all, see what the animators, historians and fans of the cartoons had to say. I also watched it first because McKimson is like the unheralded giant of classic Warner Brothers cartoons...and lot of McKimson's cartoons played a lot on ABC-TV's BUGS BUNNY AND TWEETY SHOW of the '80s and '90s and I was raised on his cartoons every bit as much as I was raised on the cartoons by Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, and Tex Avery.

The documentary is a celebration of McKimson's career...noted as being one, if not the only, person employed at Warner Brothers from it's beginning to it's end. McKimson and his brothers, Charles and Tom, were natural artists and obviously this enabled them to become animators...and later, as we know, Robert became a director at the studio. Within the documentary, strangely enough, there isn't any archival commentary from McKimson's peers at the studio and there's no verbal recordings of McKimson. There are pictures of him shown (of course!) and there's invaluable commentary from his son, Robert McKimson, Jr., and several others but there's no actual footage of the senior McKimson on camera discussing his career or the characters he known for (Foghorn Leghorn, Barnyard Dog, Prissy, Tasmanian Devil, Hippety Hopper, and Sylvester Junior).

While the documentary on McKimson is a celebration of his work and his talents it wouldn't have been realistic without discussing the sad but true fact that he's largely forgotten and unheralded when compared to Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, and Tex Avery. Several historians and cartoon enthusiasts offer their opinion on why that's the case...a lot of it has to do with the fact that McKimson passed away in 1977 before all the nostalgia and enthusiasm for cartoons really started to take off but also, according to some of the commentators, it also had to do with his low-key demeanor. It's a study in extreme ironies: McKimson was a skilled artist, animator, and director who did quite a lot of memorable cartoons but because of the low-key nature and the acclaim put on Friz, Chuck Jones, and the others through the decades it's created a scenario where a director's work is highly memorable albeit the name of the director isn't as well known by comparison. How's that for irony?

Another extra is ""Once Upon a Looney Tune""...which airs prior to the McKimson documentary on disc 2. In this feature we see the exploration of the zany, irreverent spin on fairy tales which is what's featured on Disc 2 of the collection. There are various spoofs of Little Red Riding Hood and The Three Bears in addition to other fables and fairy tales. It's interesting to note that in the ""Once Upon a Looney Tune"" feature they air a clip of Coal Black, a parody of Snow White. Those who are die-hard fans of the Looney Tunes know all about Coal Black but it caught me off-guard when I saw the clip pop up on the screen.

Bob Clampett gets his own disc...it's Disc 3. Along side Tex Avery and Robert McKimson, Clampett's cartoons are laugh out loud funny in my opinion. It's often been said that Friz Freleng's cartoons had superior timing and razor sharp music coordination which brought out the humor in almost every cartoon. It's been said that Chuck Jones had superior timing, too, on top of using eye blinks, facial expressions, and word play to bring out the humor in his cartoons...but pretty much everyone who's given commentary about a Looney Tunes cartoon seems to point out Bob Clampett's work as being the looniest of all. Ironically, Clampett received a mini-documentary of his life and career back in the Golden Collection, Volume Two but it took until Volume Five for him to get a disc devoted to his directorial contributions at the studio. There have been other Clampett cartoons sprinkled throughout Volumes 1 through 4 so it isn't like his work was completely ignored. However, compared to the amount of cartoons directed by Friz and Chuck featured on Volumes 1 through 4, Clampett's contributions pale by comparison. Some say it's because Friz and Chuck were at the studio much longer and made more cartoons therefore more of their contributions are showcased...which makes sense...but then there are those who say that limiting the Clampett cartoons was did intentionally because the irreverence, satire, and all out zaniness clashed with the works of Freleng and Jones.

There are two bonus features on Disc 3...one is all about the ""Wacky Warner One Shots"". This feature examines quite a lot of the cartoons from Warner Brothers which didn't star any of the popular characters (like Bugs, Porky, Daffy, Sylvester, etc. etc.). The second bonus feature, ""Real American Zero: The Adventures of Private SNAFU"", looks at Private Snafu...the inept soldier who doesn't do anything right. The training films were designed to teach newly enlisted soldiers how NOT to behave. By watching Snafu do the wrong things and get into a lot of trouble it was teaching soldiers to learn from Snafu's mistakes. The Snafu cartoons were never shown to the general public for obvious reasons. It's fun, though, to see the regular gallery of historians and animators who've contributed to the Golden Collection series speak more R-rated, too. The mini-documentary isn't an all out barrage of cuss words but given that it's all about the Private Snafu cartoons the language is a little bit looser. There are two bonus cartoons of SNAFU adventures and there are three cartoons starring SNAFU's Navy counterpart, Mr. Hook. SNAFU cartoons were made for the U.S. Army while the HOOK cartoons were made for the U.S. Navy.

Disc 1 features cartoons starring either Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck. Of course there are several cartoons that feature Bugs and Daffy together outwitting a shared enemy. In ""Ali Baba Bunny"" the shared enemy is Hasan, the simple minded treasure guard who can't remember the magic phrase 'open Sesame'. The main extra feature on Disc 1 is a Chuck Jones documentary from 2000 called ""Extremes and In-Betweens: A Life in Animation"". This is the second documentary on Chuck...the first, ""Chuck Amuck"", was featured on Volume One.

Part 2 of the ""Extremes and In-Betweens"" documentary is on Disc 2...along with another Chuck Jones spotlight called ""A Chuck Jones Tutorial: Tricks of the Cartoon Trade"". This was originally a bonus feature on the DVD release of ""Extremes and In-Betweens"".

Disc 4 showcases early cartoons. A bonus extra, ""Unsung Maestro's: A Directors Tribute"" takes a look at various directors at Warner Brothers who contributed quite a few cartoons for the studio but were never given a lot of spotlight. A lot of the time it was because some of the directors were there prior to the arrival of future super star characters like Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, and Bugs Bunny. The directors of the Looney Tunes in the earliest of years get some spotlight in this feature. One of the more notable cartoons on Disc 4 is ""Scrap Happy Daffy"" from 1943. It was directed by Frank Tashlin. The first cartoon directed by Tex Avery, ""Gold Diggers of '49"", is featured on Disc 4. It stars Beans the Cat but many historians say Porky Pig is the real star. The cartoon is also notable for injecting a lot of what would become trademarks of the Warner Brothers cartoons: visual humor, pop-culture references, and general craziness. The cartoon premiered in 1935...several years before Mel Blanc would become the voice of Porky Pig and what we have is original voice, Joe Dougherty, providing the vocals. The cartoon was animated by Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones several years before the two of them would become cartoon directors. Research shows that ""Gold Diggers of '49"" is the second cartoon to feature Porky Pig.

All in all this is another perfect Golden Collection...some have ripped this version apart but I have no idea why there's anger and bitterness at all. There were some bitterness by some about Volume 4 due to several of the disc's concentrating on lesser known characters and highlighting cartoons that lacked a lot of the trademark humor of later cartoons from the studio in the '40s and '50s. One of the disc's on Volume 4 was devoted to Speedy Gonzales which infuriated some but delighted others. This Volume 5, in my opinion, doesn't feature any cartoon that deviates too much from what Looney Tunes enthusiasts crave. You can't go wrong with a disc devoted to Bob Clampett, neither! On top of this there's the wonderful look at Robert McKimson's work that I wrote of at the top of this review...and then there's the Chuck Jones documentary...and there's three made-for-TV Looney Tunes specials added as extra features on Disc 4: ""Bugs and Daffy's Carnival of the Animals"", ""Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales"", and ""Bugs Bunny's Bustin' Out All Over"".",1311206400,7,10417,5.010976314269208

I thought it would be up to the standards of the others. When I tried the discs (as I always do before leaving ratings and reviews), I found that disc 3 did not work. I contacted the seller, who was nice enough to replace it immediately. The replacement did not work either!

The seller then contacted other sellers, and found that they have all had problems with disc 3 not working for buyers. Come on, Warner, how hard would it be to test a few of these to make sure they all work? Will there be a recall, and will they replace any disc 3 sent in to them? I really doubt it.

Do not reward Warner Bros for their shoddy production quality. Unless you want to just view 3 of these discs instead of the whole set, I would reccommend skipping this one unless you can guarantee that the company has fixed the problem for sure.

2909998,4,B000TSTEM8,"Like many thirty-somethings, I grew up on Looney Tunes.  The hilarious exploits of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, the Road Runner, and the gang never failed to disappoint, even when I'd seen the episodes several times over.  There was something always fresh and funny about these 'toons.

As an adult, I can appreciate the art behind the 'toons a lot better.  And it's definitely there.  But still, the main reason we have cartoons is for kids to laugh.  So I thought this collection would be perfect for my two girls (both under 6 years old).

For the most part, I was right.  Of the four DVDs worth of material, about three-and-a-half are guaranteed to keep my girls in stitches - and they had never seen Bugs Bunny before. (A shameless parenting failure on my part.)  Whether it's Bugs wondering if he should have made the left turn at Albuquerque, Yosemite Sam shrieking ""Gold!  Gold!"", or Porky Pig stuttering like there's no tomorrow, these Looney Tunes keep my girls laughing.

But there are several entries, mainly on Disc 4, that are just too darn old and dated to be of much fun.  That's not a criticism of the material, but just a recognition that these were aimed at a different audience- people sitting in theaters waiting for the next film to start.  I don't care that many of the cartoons feature racial or ethnic stereotypes - these comic archetypes are a bit startling today, but I don't consider them harmful.  But after watching Disc 4 once with the girls, the lack of laughter was reason enough to refrain from ever putting it in the player again.

I was also disappointed that there were no appearances by Marvin the Martian or Wile E. Coyote in this compilation, but you can't have everything.  All in all, a darn good collection of 'toons.",1231545600,3,1755,4.64935064935065

My twins enjoyed Disc 2, fractured versions of Fairy Tales.  Disc 3, featuring director Bob Clampett's work and Disc 4 with early Warner Bros. cartoons round out this fine addition to the Golden Collections.

There is really a wealth of material here: twenty shorts with commentaries, several Looney Tunes TV specials, multiple special features and featurettes.  If you enjoyed any of the previous collections, you will enjoy Volume Five as well.  As someone who grew up with the Looney Tunes, and who has been known to say, a la Bugs Bunny, ""of course you know this means war!"" on multiple occasions, I loved this set.

The only complaint I have about the Golden Collections is that I would have liked it better if they had collected all of the Warner Bros. cartoon shorts in chronological order, like the recent Three Stooges sets (an example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Stooges-Collection-Vol-1-1934-1936/dp/B000SSQ7JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 1: 1934-1936</a>).

The organization of these sets with their focus on either one of the creators or one of the character really adds a lot to appreciating the cartoons.

2910005,4,B000TSTEM8,"After counting down the days for a year for this installment, I was let down.  Its still great and the bonus features as always are fun, and I am glad I own it, but it had a lot of old and specialty cartoons.  I had wanted a Taz, more Pepe LePew's or Foghorn Leghorns.  These characters are being neglected by these sets since the first volume.  There were some gems: Wagon Heels no one probably knew about before this set and its one of the best animated shorts I've ever seen.  Buccaneer Bunny with Yosemite Sam is one of the best Bugs-Sam cartoons ever too.  Transylvania 6-5000 is one I had hoped for with Bugs and a Vampire.  Silly but super.  And Ali-Babba Bunny (Hasan Chop) is a favorite of a lot of people.  There are some duds here though, like Oily Hare.  Another villain that they give a southern accent to and think that means he can be carried by Bugs and counted then as variety.

I kept hoping Warner Brothers would create a ""fan's choice"" cartoon for each volume, where fans could go to a web site and vote for a certain cartoon title to be put on the next volume to come out.  But Translyvania and Ali Babba would have won such a contest anyway for this set.  The Fairy Tales disc is probably the weakest of any single disc in any Golden Collection volume so far: a lot of Red Riding Hood and a lot of Three Little Pigs but the problem is the best fairy tale cartoons were already released (The Three Little Pigs to the Brahm's Hungarian Dances and the Jazz-combo Three Little Pigs version and the Red Riding Hood with glasses and Bugs and a wolf, and all those Tortoise and the Hare discs) so this disc feels forced.  And the only fairy tale story I still wanted was Bugs and the Beanstalk where Bugs and Daffy battle a giant Elmer Fudd who wants to grind their bones- which Warner Brothers probably felt was too alike Ali Babba Bunny for inclusion, but the whole fairy tale disc feels forced.",1224633600,2,1912,4.334269662921348

Case in question: ""Seorella and the Glass Huarache"".

Now don't get me wrong, I am Mexican and not in the least offended by the depiction of my fellow nationals in the cartoon. Personally, I love Speedy Gonzalez, Slowpoke Rodriguez, the two lazy crows, the sombreroed cricket and every other ethnic pun aimed at Mexico and Mexicans. Keep them coming for all I care; I don't mind. In fact, shame on those who do!

But weak humor, tired ideas and limited animation, that I truly abhor. Seorella's only merit is that it was the last cartoon to be produced by the original WB studio. Aside from that, its storytelling is slow, the gags are predictable, and the entire thing has that cheap DePatie-Freleng look, in anticipation of toon decadence to come. Why put this insipid short and not the extraordinary ""Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarves"" that's kept locked in a vault? Now there's a comic masterpiece worth apologizing for! Why not release it,if it's already available on YouTube for free, only in substandard quality?

Warner might as well charge for it, complete with a sermon by Whoopy Goldberg and Ted Danson -in blackface, if it makes them feel better- decrying its content, instead of defrauding the consumer with a ""Golden Collection"" filled with nickel-and-dime stuff!",1221004800,24,1423,4.916666666666667

2910010,2,B000TSTEM8,"I agree with others who have complained about Looney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume Five. While the first four volumes had some of the really old stuff, Volume Five is all but saturated with them.

It is not that the really old, black-and-white cartoons have no merit. In their time, they were surely exceptional, mainly because there was nothing else to compare them to. Think about it--in the early days of cartoon animation, making a non-living character appear to move on a screen was truly remarkable. BUT the executives at Warner Brothers know very well that to most of us, Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons mean the full colour cartoons of the 1950's and 1960's that were part of our weekly Saturday viewings as kids. Those are the cartoons that most of us want to see. Almost all of the very old stuff (from the 1930's and even 1940's) is just not entertaining compared to that produced in the 1950's and 1960's.

As other people have speculated, this is a sleazy attempt by Warner Brothers executives to soak us by selling a set of 60 cartoons, when only about 25 of them have any significant appeal. It is really disingenuous for WB to have full colour artwork adorning the Volume Five box, when most of the cartoons are black and white. Also, what about the other characters? Where are Foghorn Leghorn, Speedy Gonzales, Coyote & Road Runner, and so on? Not in this set.

2910012,5,B000TSTEM8,"Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 5 is packed with lots of great classic cartoons that were made from a different era.  This collection is equally great as the previous four volumes.  At a time when standards were different, animators were free of making these fun likable animated shorts that were made from the depression era to the baby boomer era.  These cartoons are completely uncut, just the way they were released at the movies.  They're digitcally remastered so you can hear great sound and see a great clear picture.  This collection has bonuses including interviews with animators, writers and producers behind the cartoon shorts.  Plus clips from the classic ""Bugs Bunny"" TV shows from the early 1960's, with classic commercials too!  Plus more exciting features!
Keep in mind this is a collection designed for adult fans who grew up with these shorts on weekday afternoon and Saturday morning TV.  Some other shorts in this collection were not shown on TV due to the fact they had certain racial dialogue and some slapstick (or violent) scenes that would not be appropriate for children nor appropriate for cartoons produced today.
It's good the people of Warner Bros. Studios are helping to preserve history so it's not lost forever even for some of those controversial cartoons.  Otherwise, most people would say they never existed.

2910017,2,B000TSTEM8,"Anyone can say what they want about the individual cartoons in this set, but the fact is, what you're paying for is less than 2 discs worth of the few classic, color, funny cartoons that you actually spent your money to see.  The rest are so obscure that most people have never seven seen them before, and are now clearly being used as filler.  These are the unknown, worthless, un-funny cartoons with unknown characters that WB has never used for anything - ever - other than to now use them as filler to sell DVDs.

Golden Collection 1 and 2 were fantasic.  I noticed it slipping a bit with collection 3.  But collection 4 really showed that WB was running out of steam, or at least running out of steam on what they're willing to release.  Collection 5 really confirms it.

I know for a fact that there are TONS more cartons that are absolutely fantastic that they could be including but aren't (they're all over the internet).  WB did countless WW2 cartoons as well as many others that SHOULD be included in these sets - after all, the've already got the ""we know these cartoons were racist and biggoted back then, but hey, you grew up with these cartoons so you already knew that"" disclaimer on the discs (WB figured out they didn't have to save face by paying a black spokeswoman to say that).  So they should stop this messing around and release the vast volumes of the GOOD cartoons - politically incorrect or not - from huge vaults that WB is still sitting on.

Approximately 1/3 or less of Collection 5 is worthy to take up space in your DVD collection or worth paying for.  The rest of it is worth nothing more than satisfying curiosity of how uninteresting, brainless, witless and BORING cartoons used to be in the beginning (which were originally invented to sell sheet music for musical instruments).

Note to Warner Brothers:  if it was made before WW2, please leave it on the cutting room floor.  Pre-WW2 cartoons, for the most part are utterly boring.  If you want to digitize the old fossil cartoons that nobody alive today has ever seen before (or wants to see now) just to preserve them, that's fine, cool.

2910023,4,B000TSTEM8,"Warner Bros. continues to open their vault to us with the latest ""Golden"" collection. There's a lot to like here, but a few things I'm not so crazy about. Let's get them out of the way first.

The theme of each disk (you can see the ""table of contents"" elsewhere) has promise and the cartoon selections keep that promise. I didn't find many of my great favorites on any of the disks and, as is inevitable, a few `toons on each just didn't grab me at all. The fourth disk, ""Early Daze,"" contains B&W `toons from the 30s and early 40s - although their historical interest can not be denied, the style is an acquired taste that I haven't wholly acquired. Some of the stereotypes, too, grate on modern sensibilities, especially the blackface humor that still circulated back when these `toons were made. Earlier disks in the series had a disclaimer spoken by Whoopi Goldberg, and this doesn't. I hope that's because WB found viewers to be sophisticated enough to know that historical facts don't always suit contemporary mores, but let the viewer be warned anyway.

The good in this collection is very good. There are lots of `toons that I don't recall seeing before, and that's always fun. Quite a few of the early toons lampooned the famous faces of the day. Modern viewers will fail to recognize many of them - so much for fame! I was more interested to see the whole star-chasing fade away as the cartoon character took on personalities and lives of their own. The real gems of these collections show up in the extras. Those include WWII training films, with Pvt. Snafu, and TV specials. Since these `toons addressed grown men, a few points clearly addressed that somewhat rougher audience. It's pretty tame by today's standards, but the pinups must have been racy stuff back in the 1940s. The TV specials are in fact special (including one with music conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas and doggerel by Ogden Nash), and I'm still working my way through them. Despite some weak spots, the good in this collection makes it entirely worthwhile.

2910024,3,B000TSTEM8,"I think this is going to be my last purchase of these Looney Tunes collections.  I guess all the best cartoons have already been released because each box that's come out these passed few years have so much less of the cartoons we generally know, and so much more of some really old early cartoons.  Remember the ""Bugs Bunny Road Runner Hour"" that used to be on Saturday mornings back in the seventies and the eighties?  Those were the cartoons that most of us under the age of fifty enjoyed watching on TV.

Lately, these Looney Tunes collections seem to focus more of the cartoons from the very early days like back in the 1930's.  These are totally unfunny and uninteresting.  The artwork was very crude and the caricatures of famous movie stars were overly exaggerated and grotesque for art's sake.  You'd have to be over 80 years old to appreciate these old cartoons and maybe you'll enjoy them only because they remind you of your younger days.

If you are someone who remembers being in World War II than I believe that this recent box set of Looney Tunes was made for you.  If you are someone 79 years old or younger, than you may be rather bored with most of these ancient cartoons.  This first DVD of the four is usually the best DVD.  The other three start to put out the cartoons that television basically forgot.

I guess, the best way to break the cartoons down to which are the popular standards, and which are the obscure classics, is knowing that the cartoons all the kids know are the ones that were edited for children.  I see three unique eras here of Merry Melodies and Looney Tunes.  The Wartime Era, The Silver Screen Era (1945 and beyond and through the 1950's, the most popular era), then Looney Tunes seemed to be made just for children (the humor wasn't as crude, and the artwork was less detailed (meaning, the cartoons started to look like they were made for television and not the big screen like the theatre).

You'll notice that the best, most popular Tom and Jerry cartoons showed this same weakening detail to art and the vicious humor.  Tom and Jerry actually became friends in the ""made-for-television"" years.

On the fourth DVD here, you get all the old black and white cartoons with Termite Terrace's first big star, Porky Pig, and you'll get a more psychotic Daffy Duck in his earlier years.  And then on the bonus extras on this DVD, you'll get two ""made-for-television"" cartoons, from 1979 and 1980.  One's a Christmas special.  Again, the artwork and crude humor isn't the same as the 1940's and 1950's.

So, in the end, this is why I feel that all the best of Looney Tunes must be out now on the previous volumes of these Looney Tunes box sets.  However, I am sure that there are more Pepe LaPew and Foghorn Leghorn cartoons yet to be released.  I'll keep an eye out for them in the future.

I wish they released these cartoons in chronological order.  That way we could all select our more favorite eras of Looney Tunes and not get stuck with a lot of cartoons that were not even worthy of Saturday morning entertainment.

I will admit though, these old cartoons are mastered and cleaned up very well.  You can definitely see some serious effort was applied here.",1202601600,11,3207,4.551483420593368

The last two discs must be of interest to history buffs, but they are not funny at all to me.  I'm only 42, so I guess I am too young to enjoy a lot of that really early stuff.

The whole family enjoys much of Termite Terrace's productions.  However, this collection disappoints us all.  Many of the films on this collection are of the quality and sort that one may find on Dollar DVD's.  Perhaps they're just not as familiar, though I will argue they're simply not as witty - often consisting of appeal on nothing more than the amazement of staring at a big screen with cartoons on it during the fifties.  I can, and have, obtained many similar productions on the DVD's from the dollar store - and even at that price we did not enjoy this type of production.

Overall I would rate this as a $10 value given some great classics from the Terrace, however the large amount of poorly produced films greatly reduce this collection's viewing pleasure compared to its predecessors.  While many Looney Tunes are timeless, too many on this collection or worth far less than this.",1199232000,3,1023,4.675977653631285

Warner Bros. has really come through for everyone with these great DVD releases.  I hope it continues and eventually encompasses all of the black and white Looney Tunes material from the 30's and 40's.  One recommendation: please add a new icon in the menus for commentary supplied by John Kricfalusi, Eddie Fitzgerald and Kali Fontecchio so that they are easy to identify and skip.",1199232000,2,668,4.6923076923076925

The careful restoration of these films has allowed the viewer to see them in a manner unmatched since probably when they premiered in the movie theaters. Thus, not only are we treated to what fans of Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies already knew, that these cartoon shorts contain comedic timing and characterizations worthy to stand alongside the comedy masters of American cinema, we can now see much more clearly how wonderful and impressive is the art work and animation.

While many of the cartoons are familiar from repeated television viewings, a number of interesting and entertaining shorts contained in these sets have been a revelation.  And while not every one of the 1000 or so cartoons released by Warner Brothers is a gem, the films as a whole provide an educational glimpse of a provocative era in American history, ca. 1930 - 1960.

While Chuck Jones was the most talented Warners director in the late 1940s and the 1950s, Bob Clampett was the best on the lot in the war years, doing much stronger work than Jones in that period.  Earlier collections included much of Clampett's funniest work, but this 5th collection includes the brilliant ""A Tale of Two Kitties,"" which may have been too violent to make the cut for earlier discs.  That Warners would have chosen to feature Frank Tashlin (on an earlier collection) before Clampett is bizarre, given that Clampett made at least a dozen shorts better than any cartoons that Tashlin made.

Alright, alright...perhaps dat ain't fair. Daffy, Porky and the rest of the gang have their moments too. And some of the lesser known classics that feature none of the popular characters are ""nice to have"", but ain't ""need to have"", ya know, Doc?

But the Bugs Bunny shorts in this collection make it woith the dough and woith the 4 star rating. HIT THE BUY BUTTON, for sure, Doc.

It sure would be nice to be giving 5 stars to an all Bugs Bunny collection though. I mean why couldn't they sell the individual character collections separately. Rhetorical question, really. The answer is good old American capitalism. And us ma-roons keep buyin' 'em, so no point in complaining anymore.

If they release one collection on its own it should be the ""banned"" collection. This way those who might be offended don't have to purchase it, and discretion could be used to keep the banned toons from the kids. Remember these classics?...

""Fresh Hare"" - Two problems for today's sensitive viewers: A Canadian Mounted Elmer and Bugs jump into snow drifts leaving silhouettes...one of Bug's silhouettes is a shapely woman...Elmer gawks at the silhouette. And a firing squad, Bugs and Elmer ""turn into Al Jolson stereotypes"" at the end to sing along to Bugs' last wish of being in Dixie.

""Bushy Hare"" - Two problems for today's sensitive viewers: Stereotype balloon seller. And a stereotypical Aborigine dubbed by Bugs as ""Nature Boy"". ""UNGA BUNGA BUNGA INGA BINGA BINGA BUNNNGA!!!! What'd I say?! What'd I say?!""

If the Warners and the whiners have their way, you'll never see 'em on DVD. Well, if you can't own 'em, at least you can YouTube 'em. Really, take a look. Then please comment if you think that I need straightening out.",1194998400,6,1859,4.7368421052631575
2910045,5,B000TSTEM8,"Wow, it's great to see so many knowledgable folks getting ""animated"" about this series!  By my own calculations (which seem to be at odds with some others), I figure that 936 cartoons came out of the WB studios from 1930 to 1964, which includes 171 cartoons featuring Bugs (or his early
lapine prototype), 96 Daffy's, 154 Porky's, 28 Foghorn Leghorn's, 17 Pepe Le Pew's, 24 Roadrunner's, and far too many Tweety and Sylvester's to count.  Of course those figures include crossovers, so 14 cartoons feature both Bugs and Daffy and it appears as if Porky's last solo starring role prior to his career as a second banana for Daffy was 1955's
""Jumpin' Jupiter"" (which by the way should be included on the Volume 6 set).  Thankfully, we won't have to deal with any more Speedy Gonzales cartoons throughout the remainder of the series. Certainly NO ONE wants to see any of the 37 DePatie-Freling cartoons that ruined many a Saturday morning for me starting way back in 1965, and I'm glad that that particular well hasn't been dipped into yet! I still gag at how those abominations totally miscast Daffy as a stooge for that Latin rodent!

As I mentioned in my comments for ""Volume 4,"" I'm still hoping that WB will deign to finally bring to light all those ""racial"" cartoons that
many of us have had to pay through the nose for on various bootleg VHS tapes, such as the classic ""Coal Black...,"" ""Clean Pastures,"" ""Goin' To
Heaven On A Mule,"" and all those fabulously surreal ""Inky and the Mynah
Bird"" cartoons that you'd have to be over 50 to remember before they were pulled from TV in the mid-60's.  Wouldn't one disc on the next volume just about cover all those politically incorrect testaments to an earlier era?  And what about ""Bugs Nips the Nips?""  Would the howlingly funny
""Jeepers Creepers"" featuring Pinto Colvig's Goofy-esque ghost fall into that category?  No worse than ""Bacall to Arms,"" after all.

I loved how Volume 5 in this series featured some classic cartoons from the 30's, even though I'm still waiting for ""The Major Lied Till Dawn.""
In fact, I have to consider this most recent volume superior to the preceding one just for the diversity of cartoons included.  It does seem that not enough Foghorns or Pepe's have seen the light of day yet though.
And what of some of the all-time greatest Daffy cartoons that no one seems to remember, such as ""Daffy Dilly"" (""ah, it's a livin'!""), or the
wonderful department store romp with Porky, ""Riff Raffy Daffy?""  The only Daffy cartoon I haven't been able to find anywhere is ""China Jones,"" which I'm assuming might have some stereotypical renditions of orientals, but how could anything included there be any more over the top than
""Porky at the Crocadero?""

So once again, all quibbles are minor.  I'm just happy to get these classic cartoons collated on DVD so I can retire some of my well-worn VHS tapes.  BUT...as with the recent releases of the complete ""Peanuts"" series, how long must we wait?  I'm 54 and I wonder if it's going to take another 15 years to finally get EVERY WB cartoon on disc.  Would two volumes a year containing perhaps 120 cartoons total be too much to ask?
Heck, I'm going to purchase each and every one as it comes off the assembly line just like all of you, so I wish they'd hurry it up a bit.

Again, I'd like to thank all of you (well, most of you anyway...) who post your comments since even though I think I know it all, I always find out something that's new from others whose obsession seems to mirror mine.

2910046,5,B000TSTEM8,"This fifth volume in the LOONEY TUNES GOLDEN COLLECTION series is indeed a dream come true for the obsessive fan *AND* the casual viewer who remembers the golden days of having Warner Brothers cartoons not only on prime time TV but shown in all incarnations on local TV on weekday evenings.

Disk one, BUGS BUNNY & DAFFY DUCK is like reliving the days when ""THE BUGS BUNNY SHOW"" was part of prime time viewing on our TV airwaves, with cartoons that need so badly to be seen in this kind of quality, neatly blending the truly classic and the offbeat to give a well-rounded impression of how these characters developed over the years.  ""BUGS BONNETS"", a cartoon that lends new meaning to the term ""clothes make the man"" (or even bend the gender),  is one of those offbeat, subtle titles that I so often recall seeing on TV, but only on ""THE BUGS BUNNY SHOW"", and we get to see Daffy Duck in transition, his ""fun period"" as the commentary tracks stress, with cartoons like ""PEST IN THE HOUSE"" (perhaps his finest performance), ""STUPOR-DUCK"" (with its great intro by Daws Butler mimmicking all the ""SUPERMAN"" adventures in much the same way that ""SUPER RABBIT"" had done) and ""YOU WERE NEVER DUCKIER"" (a cartoon that pairs Daffy, oddly enough, with feisty Hennery Hawk, a kind of link to the little guy's ""foist"" cartoon, ""THE SQUAWKING HAWK"" in which Hennery goes out on his very first hunt for chickens after refusing to eat his ""woims"", and we realize that he still doesn't know what a chicken really is.  Even nicer is the fact that, if you missed your chance, like me, to have the entire ""STUPOR-DUCK"" music track in any format, as it once appeared on the cassette only of an audio collection called THE CARL STALLING PROJECT, here's your ultimate chance to have the audio and the video in one place!!

Disk Two gives us some terrific FAIRY TALE fractures, long before Jay Ward had done it with Bill Scott, and the restorations here are eye and ear-popping!!  Yes, it truly pops the ears to hear the restorations on toons like ""THE BEAR'S TALE"" and ""LITTLE RED WALKING HOOD"", not to mention (but you know I'll mention it anyway) ""HOLIDAY FOR SHOESTRINGS"" because of its splendid music track and, now, fully restored title card and overall visual and audio.  On the first two disks, we get parts one and two of ""EXTREMES AND IN-BETWEENS"", a special on the career of Chuck Jones originally run on PBS.  I missed this one, but am now glad it is neatly housed in this set as ""BUGS BUNNY, SUPERSTAR"" was in the fourth volume, giving Robert Clampett his own platform to tell of his days at Termite Terrace.  Chuck Jones does indeed do himself justice in this long overdue documentary and we also learn of what it really takes to make a clever animated cartoon.  Upon seeing this special we long for a shot at ""THE DOT AND THE LINE"" on some collection in the near future and, perhaps, this is a hint of what's to come.

Disk Three gives us a well-rounded glance at yet more Robert Clampett cartoons, oddly beginning with a title that was finished by Arthur Davis but still has Clampett's ""stamp"" and howl and overall twisted sense of humor about it, ""BACALL TO ARMS"", also including true classics like ""THE WISE-QUACKING DUCK"", ""WAGON HEELS"", both versions of ""HARE RIBBIN'"" and that hilarious impression of Bugs and Elmer Fudd as aged adversaries looking back at their ""careers"", with the hapless hunter still chasing Bugs with his ""wightning quick wabbit-kiwwer"".

It is the special feature section on this disk that shines, though.  Aside from the alternate ""director's cut"" of ""HARE RIBBIN'"" mentioned above, you get two PRIVATE S.N.A.F.U."" shorts and three ""HOOK"" cartoons pushing war bonds and what to do after the term of duty, with great voice work here by Arthur Lake; makes you wonder why he didn't do more voice work for the studio in the homefront cartoons.

But it is the fourth disk here that is the fan favorite for this reviewer!  This is an entire disk labeled ""THE EARLY YEARS"" and we truly learn just how some of the earliest characters and traits in LOONEY TUNES stars blossomed.  The disk opens with ""ALPINE ANTICS"", a fun cartoon which shows what the studio's finest unsung animators could do with Disney-like characters, taking them in their own direction, ""I'VE GOT TO SING A TORCH SONG"" which takes the BUSBY BERKELEY number and does a fantastic job of starting up the list of caricature-laiden cartoons as time capsule of the various entertainers and celebrities of the day (and this cartoon actually features restored footage that did not appear as part of the BUSBY BERKELEY collection's special feature) and ""MILK AND MONEY"", one of those early PORKY PIG cartoons, giving the viewer a chance to see Porky before Mel took over as his voice, when Joe Dougherty, a real stutterer, gave Porky his vulnerable and naive charm.  Other highlights here include ""EATIN' ON THE CUFF"" (a Robert Clampett clasic about a little moth that falls for a honey bee and even integrates live action in to the cartoon) and ""WISE QUACKS"" (a cartoon in which Daffy Duck, an expectant father, nervously ingests a little too much of the bubbly and, somehow, the poor kid gets left behind, strange and dark and truly a lost LOONEY TUNES treasure), ""SCRAP-HAPPY DAFFY"" (showing Daffy Duck's over-the-top patriotism with a great reference to that one-eyed sailor in hopes that a can of spinach could save Daffy and the day) and ""WHOLLY SMOKE"" (a parable on the perils of smoking as only those at Termite Terrace could deliver it)!!  There are others as well, like ""PORKY AT THE CROCCADERO"" a tour de force for Porky Pig who wants to become an entertainer in the worst way and, eventually, does, mimmicking entertainers of the age like Cab Calloway in much the same way as the first LOONEY TUNES star, Bosko, had done with Maurice Chevallier in a cartoon called ""BOSKO IN PERSON"", only Porky had a jazzier score, thanks to Carl Stalling.  It is a top-notch disk from beginning to end and a fantastic finale to one of the best sets I've bought this year!!",1194480000,14,6046,4.702932828760643
2910047,5,B000TSTEM8,"The fifth set of Warner Brothers shorts is, once again, an excellent mix of shorts.  I was most pleased to see an entire disc of the black and white shorts and a disc devoted to Bob Clampett.  While discs devoted to single characters can be problematic (the sameness of the shorts makes watching them a bit tedious) doing discs devoted to directors, particularly the better ones, like Clampett (or Frank Tashlin, who got the same treatment on an earlier set) is apt to be more entertaining because most directors worked with different characters and did one-shot cartoons and thus there's greater variety available for those discs.

Once again, there are featurettes, commentaries and a major documentary (on Chuck Jones this set) as well as some Private Snafu shorts, Mr. Hook shorts and other bonus material.  Three of the made-for-television LT specials are included on the fourth disc.

The shorts look absolutely beautiful to boot.  I look forward to many more volumes-I'm still personally hoping for every single short WB made to be released on DVD in this series.  Most highly recommended.",1194048000,3,1096,5.0220994475138125

I find the early stuff fascinating and I remember some of it playing on local stations in the early 80s although in colourized versions. Hopefully some of the next couple of volumes will have more of the 1930s materials covering the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies moving from black and white to colour and from the Harman-Ising years to afterwards.

The box blabs about the ""60 cartoons"" contained within, but the special features give you over a dozen more (including rare Tasmanian Devil and Marvin Martian TV shorts)... and that's not even to start on the multiple hours of documentaries and specials. A large handful of vintage 1960s Bugs and Daffy commercials are fascinating (and funny; Daffy at the duck-shoot carnival game, anyone?).
While not yet daring to release the most famous politically incorrect shorts, WB deserves plaudits for daring to include PORKY AT THE CROCADERO and WHOLLY SMOKE unedited.
Perhaps the only minus is the 1930s disc: not the (excellent) concept, but the execution, as it features about 85% Porky and Daffy when the chance to include some early Harman and Ising classics (Bosko, Foxy) was right there, and missed. Bosko is all over the documentaries on this set but it's still not the same.

2910052,4,B000TSTEM8,"Before I comment on the package itself, I have to reply to those who think these shorts contain too much ""old"" material, as opposed to the latter material that was only shown on television as ""The Bugs Bunny Show"" and all its recycled sequels. The cartoons on these shows were only from 1948 on because (at the time, and for several years afterward) Warner didn't own the early ones anymore.  They only 'distributed' the Schlesinger shorts, and as a result, couldn't show them when they were sold to other companies.  These ones ended up in syndication on local stations, and many were on MGM/UA videotapes in the 1980's, then on 5 separate MGM/UA laserdisc sets throughout the 1990's. Once Warner bought Turner Entertainment, the cartoons came back under their distribution.

Sadly missing in the current flock of WB LTGC DVD's were several b&w Looney Tunes, which were the secondary series, but were also the star-making series for Porky Pig and Daffy Duck.  With volume 5, this scenario is changing for the better. Merrie Melodies were the color 'prestige' pictures, and sadly, most of their 1-shot and 'objects come to life' cartoons don't hold up as well anymore.

On to the new box set.

During his tenure at WB, Bob Clampett as director created the funniest and most far-out cartoons for Schlesinger.  Clampett's were the furthest thing from Disney in terms of animation and sense of humour, where directors like Chuck Jones were still trying to emulate Disney in realism and cuteness.  It is great to see Clampett get his due, and what is on this disc is a drop in the bucket, even with shorts of his that have been issued on other sets.  It was the Warner cartoons of the early 40's that turned Bugs Bunny into the biggest cartoon star, eclipsing Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in popularity.

The only thing for me that prevents the set from being 5-star is the repetetiveness of the Fairy Tales disc. 3 back-to-back Red Riding Hood stories is a bit excessive, yet we still have to wait for the acclaimed (yet banned but remastered) ""Coal Black an' De Sebben Dwarfs"", one of the most frantically paced cartoons Bob Clampett ever created.

Warner should be applauded for creating these collectors' sets - and that is truly what they were meant to be - the two disc sets were designed for more casual fans.  Don't stop now.",1193270400,7,2329,4.737623762376238

They are more interested in Spongebob Squarepants, The Fairly Odd Parents, and Hannah Montana and High School Musical from Disney. But, the classic eera of animation still remains a jewel that is fun and worth watching all over again. the previous volumes of the Looney Tunes: Golden Collection had a few flaws, but they overall didn't dissapoint. Now, that magical time is there again to say hello to the classic Warner Brothers gang, but does this volume shine like the previous editions, or does it fall from grace as the way the budget-priced spotlight collections do?

The Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5 is a 4 disc DVD collection that reflects the best of Warner Brothers greatest cast of characters from the golden era of animation. The collection contains 60 great cartoons that try as the cream of the crop. But, there are a few surprises that are shown here, as the first disc completely displays. The first disc, which was basically all about Bugs Bunny from the previous four volumes, but this time he has to share the spotlight with one of his friendly foes, Daffy Duck. The first disc does slim down the number of Bugs cartoons here, but they do show Bugs & Daffy duking it out like the old Bing Crosby & Bob Hope days, as was the case which director Chuck Jones brightly displayed on cartoons like Ali Baba Bunny and The Abominable Snow-Rabbit from 1961. There are also a lot of great here from the two seperate here including The Stupor Salesman, where Daffy is a door-to-door salesman who tries to sell anything to a wanted criminal who thinks Daffy is with the police, and wants him dead, as well as Bugs' Bonnets, where Elmer Fudd goes after Bugs as usual, but the aid of falling hats Bugs & Elmer act out what hats they were in a unrealistic way of what they wear from a game warden, to Elmer wearing a brides' vale. It is one of my favories.

Disc 2 is all about looney fairy tales, and the way Warner Brothers tailor made the Looney Tunes gang, through classic fairly tales like Senorella & The Glass Hurache, a mexican version of the classic Cinderella story, and Bewitched Bunny where Bugs walks into a Hansel & Gretel story where the debut of Witch Hazel and her craving for children, turns to a craving for rabbit stew. There are also a few other great delights here including Goldimouse & The Three Cats with Sylvester Jr. demanding something different than pourage, and Sylvester does whatever it takes to get his son a mouse to eat. There are a few lesser-known gems here as well including Holiday For Showstrings, and The Trial Of Mr. Wolf, where the wolf speaks his side of the story in a weird twist on the Red Riding Hood story.

Disc 3 pays respect one of the most influential animation directors of all time, the great Bob Clampett, who helped innovate the looney, into looney tunes. This one brought out the first peak of the classic cartoons from the 1930's and 1940's when Clampett worked with Warners. The collection on this disc shines noblely well with great classics like The Old Greay Hare where Elmer Fudd goes ahead in time into the year 2000 and tries to go after an older aged, Bugs but falls victim to his looney ways, and Patient Porky, where Porky visits a hospital after overeating a birthday cake, but falls prey to a phoney doctor who tries to do more than surgery on Porky. There also is The Bashful Buzzard, which was one of the few cartoons with the unforgettable Beaky Buzzard who tries to find something to bring home for dinner for his family to cook, but is just dopey enough to bring anything from a bumble bee, to even a dragon.

The final disc, mainly focuses in on Warner Brothers beginnings from the 1930's, with Porky Pig as the main attraction here in classic cartoons like Porky's Poppa, and Wholly Smoke. There isn't much here, but there are a lot of extras that work well on the final disc including specials like Bugs Bunny's Bustin' Out All Over which include gems like Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Bunny, where a pint-sized Bugs & Elmer go out each others wits, and the actual one time where Wile E. Coyote is up to his old tricks, but finally catches his prey, the Road Runner.

All in all, The Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5 isn't a bad buy for die hard Looney Tunes fans, but surprisingly could've had a bit more from the first disc with Bugs & daffy, which I was hoping for much better. I was hoping classic cartoons like The Million Hare and People Are Bunny would've been used with two of them going at each other instead of the ones they are just seperate and funny. It isn't as much of a must buy for newcomers, as was the case with the previous golden collections, but it does show most of its merit, and that is all folks. Hopefully, the next volume can bring in more of the zany action.

2910055,5,B000TSTEM8,"Not content to rest on their laurels, the wizards at WB have come up with yet another sterling release of classic Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons. Assembled with the same care, dedication, and intelligence that has been the hallmark of these releses, this release has a healthy dose of very rare classics from the '30s, many of which haven't been seen uncut for years. In addition, there are many of the latter cartoons like SAHARA HARE, which fans have wanted since the first release.

Best of all the cartoons are beautifully restored and uncut. Seen as they were meant to be seen, and in better shape than you can imagine.

It's a Looney Tunes dream come true!",1192838400,4,669,4.758620689655173
2910056,5,B000TSTEM8,"It's laughable that this collection is being attacked for purportedly catering to ""animation historians.""  Most of these cartoons are at least forty years old, people!  Oh, but add twenty more years and then they're ""junk.""  Must be those baby boomers with their attitude of ""it was popular when I was growing up, which makes it soooo very important.""

The studio deserves praise for reaching into their vaults, obviously not a commercial endeavor if only ""historians"" are interested.  But really, you don't have to be a historian to enjoy these early examples of animation art.  Many viewers do, including some who consider themselves ""discriminating.""",1192752000,5,653,5.29126213592233

8210838,5,B000TSTEM8,"Just finished watching Vol. 5 and it's well worth it. I consider myself a big Looney Tunes fan just to specify. I already owned the Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection Vol. 5 which is a 2 Disc DVD set and it's basically Disc's 1 and 2 of this Golden Collection Vol. 5 here except on Disc 2 of Golden you have ""A Gander at Mother Goose"" and ""Senorella and the Glass Huarache"" and on the Spotlight Disc 2 you have ""A Tale of Two Kitties"" (which is Tweety bird 1st appearance in 1942 as featherless not yellow bird with cats Babbit and Catstello, all-time great cartoon) and ""Porky's Pooch"".  But the reason I bought this Golden Collection Vol. 5 is because of Disc 3 which is all Bob Clamped cartoons. Including ""Buckaroo Bugs"" with Red Hot Ryder, the controversial ""Hare Ribbin"" with both versions of the cartoon included, ""The Bashful Buzzard"" with Beaky, ""The Old Grey Hare"" with Bugs and Elmer as old guys and babies in cartoon, and again ""A Tale of Two Kitties"" which I spoke about on Spotlight Vol. 5 Disc 2 earlier above. Finally Disc 4 of this Golden Collection is all Black and White cartoons, but don't be fooled by B/W cartoons because there are some good oldies here on Disc 4. This is a great addition to any Looney Tunes fan's movie collection. The Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 5 is more expensive than Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection Vol. 5, mainly because Golden is 4 Discs and Spotlight is only 2 Discs. In concluding I would say if your just looking for a few good cartoons go with Spotlight, but if you really appreciate early cartoons and not the crap we have today I would go with the Golden Collection. Either way Looney Tunes are the best cartoons in the history of the universe !!!",1512000000,,1710,4.516129032258065

8210840,5,B000TSTEM8,"Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 5."" The fifth collection of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies mixes classics and obscurities. Among the best-known and funniest cartoons are ""Ali Baba Bunny"" (Daffy yelling, ""I'm rich! I'm socially secure!""), ""Bewitched Bunny"" (Witch Hazel galloping off in a cloud of hair pins), and ""Buccaneer Bunny"" (a sterling example of one of director Friz Freleng's favorite gags: having the characters run up and down stairs and in and out of various doors).

""Gold Diggers of '49"" and ""Little Red Walking Hood"" show Tex Avery beginning to explore the self-reflexive gags that would be become one of the hallmarks of his mature style. In ""Walking Hood,"" Grandma stops the action to answer the phone and place her order with the grocer--including a case of gin. ""The Daffy Doc"" is Bob Clampett at his most surreal, with Daffy and Porky getting sucked into an iron lung, bulging and shrinking like balloon animals.

Some of the earliest cartoons predate the adoption of ""The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"" as the theme song for the Warner Bros. cartoons. Many shorts from the early '30s were built around songs from Warner's musicals: ""I've Got to Sing a Torch Song"" (written for Gold Diggers of 1933) features caricatures of Mae West, George Bernard Shaw, Benito Mussolini, and Bing Crosby frolicking to the title tune. Greta Garbo delivers the closing, ""That's All, Folks!""

Bonus extras on GOLDEN COLLECTION VOLUME 5 include three World War II films in which Mr. Hook urges sailors to buy war bonds; Extremes and In-Betweens: A Life in Animation"" (2000), a documentary about Oscar-winning director Chuck Jones; 3 Looney Tunes TV specials starring Bugs Bunny; commentaries and Behind the Tunes featurettes with animators, historians and voice artists; and music and music-and-effects only tracks on selected shorts.

 When I was growing up, these cartoons were shown extensively on TV, but because many featured graphic, stylized violence, they were deemed inappropriate for kids. They were either heavily censored, usually eliminating lots of the jokes, or simply not shown. Its gratifying to see these cartoons, many of which are classics, complete and uncut.

The 4-disc unrated DVD release contains 30 original Warner Brothers cartoons made between 1935 and 1964. Most are in color. Featured characters include Daffy Duck, Tweety and Sylvester, Porky Pig, Bugs Bunny, and Elmer Fudd.",1502928000,,2412,5.251948051948052
