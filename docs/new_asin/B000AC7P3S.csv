2384345,3,B000AC7P3S,"Miike is certainly not a conventional filmmaker and this may be his most unconvetional film. That doesn't make it bad(far from it), nihlism & self destruction are the main themes played out in an almost acid trip of a movie.

For some reason it reminds me of The Last Temptaion of Christ splattered in blood, begging for mercy and asking the ultimate truth of human suffering.(with some really great cameos)

Only for true Miike fans.",1162425600,,434,4.773333333333333
2384346,1,B000AC7P3S,"I almost watched this movie to its entirety when I finally just could not take being bored further. I was even fast-forwarding through the last 20 minutes in case anything interesting happened. Nothing did.

Afterwards, I couldn't stop thinking how awful this movie is. The entire movie is quite literally: sword fight, mumble some half-baked philosophies on life slowly and deliberately, repeat. I just can't stop thinking about how every aspect of this movie disappointed me. Even the sword fights are stupid and pointless. Every opponent of Izo seems to come from the school of ""hold up my weapon over my head so that Izo can slash me apart"" fighting. As if it wasn't easy enough already, Izo can't die, and isn't affected by what would be fatal wounds to anyone else. After the first few fights, one wonders what is the point? What makes it even more disappointing is that a lot of his opponents are really cool looking. At least they could have fair fights that would actually be entertaining.

The endless philosophical rantings between each fight become increasingly agitating as well. I think what they were actually saying could be thought-provoking if I actually cared, but I didn't because I could only think about how stupid this movie is. It was like watching a pretentious art film blabbing about the human condition, except that it was TWO HOURS LONG.

To sum it up, I was shocked to find that the place where I thought (hoped) the movie would be ending was still less than half-way through. The pointless fight scenes, the deliberateness of everything in between, and the endless cycle of repetition just destroys anything that's remotely likeable about the movie, and somehow what could be an intelligent movie with lots of fighting turns into the most boring movie ever.",1160524800,,1788,4.894389438943894
2384347,1,B000AC7P3S,"Maybe it's me but I cant understand why some martial movies don't stick to the format of a basic story line nothing to compilcated but simple, wrapped around well designed fight scenes. But this movie was like nothing I had seen before or could have imaged in my wildest dreams. It's an onslaught of blood and gore making no sense at all, and no attempt to put together a good fight throughout the film. Why do these people think that most people buy martial arts movies it's for the FIGHTING, FIGHTING, FIGHTING and maybe if you'll lucky you will find one that has a decent story line. This movie is so bad that I don't know anyone I could give it to, maybe I could get rid of it at a flea market?",1151712000,,698,4.2556390977443606
2384348,2,B000AC7P3S,"I suggest watching the original version: Sword of Doom - which is amazing. A lot less acid is involved, and less cliche. Izo is a rent, at best.",1144195200,,144,4.178571428571429
2384349,5,B000AC7P3S,"IZO through my eyes is a beautiful reflection of the darkside of the human soul.  I don't want to get into the details of the movie because I'm sure enough of the other reviewers already have.  However I'm compelled to comment on how incredible the soundtrack is.  The music is very original, beautiful, and thought provoking.  It's basically poetry to acustic music that narrates the movie throughout IZO's transformation.  On every level IZO is an incredible movie.  I recomend everyone see this and not look for a spoonfed meaning to the events throughout.

I would also like to add that IZO does not just kill everyone without conscience.",1143331200,,642,4.888888888888889
2384350,2,B000AC7P3S,"Well Miike fans here we go with a movie that I didn't like.  It's definitely strange enough and bloody enough but it's also too long, too boring and it doesn't have that Miike feel to it, like say DEADLY OUTLAW: REKKA, ICHI THE KILLER, YAKUZA DEMON or GOZU.  It felt like Miike was just cashing a check.

From what I gathered Izo was an evil samurai who's crucified and speared to death.  His spirit goes into an eternal Hell where he uncontrollably jumps from place to place throughout time and dimensions.  Wherever he lands he kills people then just jumps to somewhere else and he does this over and over again and again and again for two hours.

Unless you're a diehard Miike fan I'd skip it.  If you're looking for a more straightforward and rewarding samurai movie then check out THE TWILIGHT SAMURAI or SWORD OF DOOM or if you're looking for some quality non-Miike weirdness watch Sasaki's CRAZY LIPS.",1143331200,,908,4.60248447204969
2384351,1,B000AC7P3S,"I love Takashi Miike films, and in fact I think his movie Audition is one of the best movies ever made, and perhaps the best horror film. It's because of my love for his movies that I'm willing to forgive him this movie.

The best way to describe Izo is take a little Kill Bill Vol. 1 with The Grudge, throw it into a blender and chop the hell out of it until it's a formless, tasteless (and I mean this in more than one way) mass of senseless violence and confusing plot lines. To garnish, place laughing flowers (which make an appearance in the movie) on the side with the birth fluid (which also makes an appearance, as a woman licks it from her fingers). And then feed it to the dog and wait a while for him to go to the bathroom. What's left behind is Izo.

Seriously, nothing in this movie made any sense after the first ten minutes, and I can say that even the first ten minutes made no sense, but isn't that true in all movies? The violence is indeed senseless and very repetitive. You never quite know where or at what time period Izo is at. In truth, all this movie was was an exercise in patience. How long can you stand the hack-and-slash of samurai swords before you turn it off? I can't and won't recommend this movie to anyone.",1139961600,,1242,4.214285714285714
2384352,4,B000AC7P3S,"Many say that this film is just a completely brutal and totally pointless movie. I disagree with this enormously. Miike would never make a movie that has no theme or hidden message in it. Izo, to me, is a reflection of today's society. Our man, Izo is hardcore and ruthless, and seems to be killing out of the pure joy of it. Do we not in today's world also commit such acts? Maybe not to such an extreme as this movie portrays... but Miike always ALWAYS shows us things exxagerated to the utmost and fullest. I found Izo to actually be very philosophical and actually referenced Buddhism folk-tales from time to time. You gotta look in between the lines. Izo is for the intelligent crowd who knows how to handle sarcasm and large (very large) amounts of violence. I think if you really study Miike's work, you'll find this film satisfactory. And if you don't want to think and just wanna see some repulsive scenes of gore, you can go for this one as well (weirdo).",1135641600,,965,4.488636363636363
2384353,1,B000AC7P3S,Don't waste a single penny on this movie! It was total crap! No plot what so every and the main character was horrible! My eyes are still burning from this one!,1135123200,,160,4.193548387096774
2384354,5,B000AC7P3S,"The movie starts out with our hero, Izo, being gruesomly crucified. Because of his rage towards the ones who crucified him, he travels through time to present day to wreak his vengence on them. Then a bunch of stuff happens that has no relevance to the plot really, including: having sex with mother nature, a woman pulling a sword out of her vagina then izo throwing a rock at her face, being killed several times, a very trippy scene where he is sucked underwater and comes up on the other side of some wedding where he kills the groom and bride then is sucked back, killing little children, killing a group of mothers in the hallway, vampires, being attacked by a swat team, and a random guy singing while playing an out of tune guitar. While he does all this he turns into a demon then finally kills the ones that were responsible for his crucifixion.

This movie gets 5 stars because it is so random and has made me mentally insane since watching it and other japanese films like it.",1133913600,,988,4.458563535911602
2384355,2,B000AC7P3S,"I'm a fan of Miike, but _Izo_ is just too much. There's no plot whatsoever, just a poor unfortunate reincarted samurai wandering through time and space and killing everyone who crosses his path. That's it! End of sentence! If you think you can stand over two hours of this, give it a try. If you're looking for something with even a rudimentary plot, you might want to try something else, like _Audition_ or _Ichi the Killer_. I'd rather watch the incomprehensible _Gozu_ again than be forced to sit through _Izo_. It is a beautifully-photographed, but ultimately pointless film. Maybe the 6th or 7th other film Miike directs this year will be more interesting.",1131926400,,661,4.8584070796460175
2384356,5,B000AC7P3S,"My fiancee is a huge fan of Japanese cinema, but for the most part is a huge fan of the work of possibly the most certifiably insane man to ever get behind a camera, Takashi Miike.  I too am a fan of his work, mostly because he's broken so many boundaries in filmmaking that the society needs to create new boundaries just so he can break them.

To say he's a cinematic genius is a bit of an understatement.  He has done so many films it's hard to really know what his style is, since he never does the same thing with each film, each time he always does something a little different.  I'm fairly certain that as we live and breathe that Miike's name will stand next to some of the other great extravagant filmmakers like David Lynch or even David Cronenberg.

anyway, I'm getting off topic here.  Trying to describe or even explain just what is going on with the movie 'Izo' is not exactly easy, because you need to see the film itself.  It's not so much a film as an experience.

The story essentially is about an ancient samurai warrior named Izo, he was the most brutal assassin there ever was, and he was put to death, he was crucified, but even then he couldn't die because he wasn't allowed into Heaven or even Hell.  This frustration only fuels Izo's rage and so he sets about cutting a path throughout history to find the ones in charge, the Gods if you will and to eliminate them and damn anyone who gets in his way.  And so for the next two hours we get Izo doing exactly that, killing all sorts of people, leaving a trail of bodies left and right, up and down, inside out and upside down all over the place as he makes his way to the those in charge.  it's an insane tale because no one is safe from Izo's wrath, both the guilty and the innocent, his own mother, innocent children, a couple about to get married, vampires, gun toting soldiers, no one is safe.

Essentially the story can be viewed as one man's fight against the establishment, how one person all alone fights against insurmountable odds to achieve his goals.  Throughout the film people basically try and plead with him, try to reason with him to stop what he's doing to just repent before its too late, or in other words to just give up and sell out and give up his individual freedom to do what he wants, his obsession is admirable but is also a bit flawed, because this film also showcases that violence is a never ending cycle as depicted in a very brilliant scene with Izo running on the symbol of infinity.  There has to come a moment when enough is enough, because when all you know in your life is violence, there is nothing left for anything else, like love or peace or happiness, and this can be seen as over the course of the film Izo's anger, and bloodlust slowly transform him into a demonic creature, because with each life he takes he loses more and more of his humanity.

The acting, the action, the special effects, the camera work, everything is awesome.  Of course its the sort of quality you tend to associate with a Miike film.

After watching this film, the only thing I have to ask myself is 'what is he going to do next?'  I'm sure after you watch this film you'll be thinking the exact same thing, at least I hope you will.

Highly Recommended!",1129593600,,3247,4.337190082644628
2384357,3,B000AC7P3S,"Having seen Ichi the killer and audition i stumbled across this special edition of izo in town on the new release wall and sparadically bought it due to the cool cover and Miike is pretty crazy and i was interested how he would do a samurai movie.oh but its not your typical samurai movie its miike's vision of a low leval samurai that was crucified then comes back as a unstopable killing machine that visits different time periods and slaughters everyone who stands in his way.easily one of the most violent movies ever .not as gruesome or disturbing as some of the stuff in ichi or audition but just more crazy sparadic killing. Thats were the problem sets in the movie is basically scene after scene of constant killing with some story thrown in between with old film of WW2 and other things then a song by a guy with an aucustic guitar.repeat.repeat.repeat that what this movie is composed of.i do respect what miike is trying to say and acomplish in this movie but it does try your patience,but it is for the most part a very beutiful,visual movie that i think you should watch at least once,but it is better the second time when you kind of realize what miike is trying to say and you can make some since out of the plot.or just watch it again for all the cool fights and non-stop killing.",1129075200,,1296,4.472573839662447

tha extraordinary,fantastic and brilliant part of the movie was the weirdo-bard that was singing every once in a while with his guitar...his songs were great!!! the movie worth buying or hiring just to listen to those songs!

2384359,3,B000AC7P3S,"A simple idea: a man is being killed somewhen far in the past but his soul turns into a wandering spirit that is drifting throught it's own inner hell. In my opinion the conclusion could be understood purely psychological: if you hate the world the world will hate you because your hate will be understood and answered the same way, like it or not.

Philosophical in a way, this movie is infinitly uncompromising. Imagine Kill Bill, remove the ""Assasin squad"" and replace it with all sorts of historical enemies, ranging from samurai spirits to demon killers to demons to Yakuzas to SWAT teams to school kids to female teachers to infernal whores to a wedding banquet to your own mother... the list goes on and there's more blood and guts here than in Ichi the killer, a lot more actually. The gods are dressed like business men, commanding all those historical enemies to stop Izo from crushing them.

Izo hates everything that exists and so does everything that exists hate Izo, but nothing 'really' exists. Izo is a wandering soul that has no soul, he is the ""infinite absurdity"". This movie is the most consequent version of the classic 'never ending hell' tale. Long after Izo has begun killing everyone standing in his way, he and the audience comes to realize that there is no way, there is no goal, there is only the neverending slaughter and vengeance of everything, hell is repetition with no end, violence leads to more violence. Izo somehow symbolizes the capacity of violence, so it's only logic he can't die. As long as violence comes his way in the guise of his attackers, he continues to exist. Yeah, it's that simple and the formula isn't going to change untill the very end of the movie.

There's hardly a minute without arterial sprays, hardly a character that is not being slaughtered sooner or later, no matter who it is: buddha, lovers, demons, cops, kids... sometimes it's almost funny (the wedding banquet...). I believe there are certain similiarties to Miike's ""Graveyard of honor"" in which a yakuza is going to battle against the rest of the world. To me, both characters could be understood as an allegory to social behaviour and historical events.

The furthermore sadistic aspect of the movie is that Izo cannot die but is suffering just as much as his victims, violence goes where violence comes from. Sometimes Izo is surrounded by a dozen enemies, he's fighting one toe-to-toe while the others keep stabbing their knives, swords and stuff into Izo's bleeding body that therefore is covered in blood with countless injuries throughout the whole film, every attack is a painful experience for Izo and is being responded with more violence. Repeat that around a thousand times and yeah, that's pretty much what this movie is all about on screen. It's like playing GTA with the ""everybody's attacking you""-cheat... It all begins with Izo's execution at the beginning of the movie which has to be one of the goriest and most painful in film history.

If you truly hate somebody and need to release some mental tension, that is the movie for you. It's an endless and pretty mindless killing spree, the dialogues are beautiful, visuals as well, it's Takashi Miike, it's very brutal, and, frankly, very very boring. Sure, every sword battle is skillfully shot as if Miike has never done anything else but this sort of films. Nevertheless, it's for the first time I remember that I was watching the last 20 minutes in spooling speed. I knew these 20 minutes would show nothing else but another 100 (at minimum) sword executions and I was right but didn't want to miss the ending. It's a pretty long movie but it seems even longer reagarding it's repetive nature and background message that should be clear to anyone around 4000 deaths before the final conclusion. At the end, thank god, it all becomes symbolic when Izo is standing on a bizar platform that is part of the 'symbol of neverending infinity', realizing, that for deliverance, there has to be another way to go than hate and vengeance. One could sense a political statement here but regarding the fact that with AUDITITION there was absolutly no social commentary intended by neither the director nor the screen writer, IZO could as well be seen as just another killer freak show for pure sick entertainment.",1123027200,,4294,4.813008130081301
2384360,5,B000AC7P3S,"If you don't 'get' this movie, the movie is not to blame. Takashi Miike is a beloved maniac with the film medium and IZO is a great film for the connoisseur. Consuming IZO requires a mind that is not polluted with Hollywood miasma. In a world where absurdity reigns supreme IZO wields the cleansing sword of unforgiving hatred for all that hides behind the sickness of identity.

True to form for many Japanese samurai & horror movies, there was a lot of slashing & blood spouting; but aside from that, there was no story that I could follow.

While some people will applaud the director for making a ""David Lynch"" or ""Cronenberg"" style movie, it was (for me), little more than a waste of time.

It was so bad, that I gave up watching the last 30 minutes.

8077601,5,B000AC7P3S,"Some reviewers have said that Izo is merely a senseless bloodbath. Nothing could be further from the case.

Izo was an assassin on the losing side of a war; he was crucified after its completion. His spirit then seeks out revenge against the universe itself.

The rulers - the bishop, the scholar, the general, and so on - which he seeks to destroy should not be seen as mere individuals. They are prototypes, representatives of the elements of the system of control afflicting humanity from time immemorial. They also govern the cosmos' karmic order; Izo's revenge is against the fundamental deceit underlying it.

At first, Izo's story is purely one of revenge; over time, it takes on an additional quality - a search the reason of his existence. His enemies can't understand this pursuit. It is false to say that Izo kills without discrimination - in fact, attentive viewers become sympathetic to Izo as the plot continues, as we see how each kill anguishes his soul. He only kills those who stand in the way of his quest or who embody society's deceitful structure, such as the couple in the marriage ceremony. The students in class, who are learning the truth, are left alone despite Izo's recalling of Hanpeita's admonition to become a killing machine. Quietly eating peasants are untouched.

This movie is, I think, Miike's greatest film. It would help to brush up on Japanese culture before viewing - to understand the notion of karma and some symbolism (a spinner, for example, is a sign of fate). The effort will be well spent.",1280880000,,1537,4.8106060606060606
8077602,1,B000AC7P3S,"If you've ""seen"" this ""movie"" I feel your pain.
Don't get me wrong I enjoyed quite a few of Miike's films However this doesn't have the right to be called a film. ""This"" has the production values of a made for TV movie. I wonder why? Oh maybe because it was shot on the Old Japan NHK studio lot. The premise is terrible and the ""story"" is even worse. So some samurai gets crucified and is reincarnated or something then kills and stabs and swings his sword around like he was trying to hit a pinata. If you enjoy samurai films I'm sure you've seen some films staring the great Toshiro Mifune. The way Mifune handles a sword compared to Izo makes him seem like he was Musashi. Basically what the movie boils down to is this ""Izo kills Everyone For No Reason""
Oh a random guy we don't care about is talking to Izo about meaningless philosophy, since we know Izo has killed everyone in this movie so far we don't expect it right? Oh what he got killed by Izo for no reason. Wow, Meaningless Violence. So if you follow this line of reasoning this is what happens. There is no reason for anything at all in this movie. In that case there is no reason this movie should have been made in the first place. At some point during this endurance test you just want someone to kill Izo more than anything. So If you share some of my sentiment Watch Sword Of DOOM witch is far superior not to mention more artful than this waste of film.

Also See Hitokiri (the original 1966) instead.",1250726400,,1472,4.294964028776978
8077603,3,B000AC7P3S,"One should always go into a Miike Takeshi flick expecting something weird.  That is just taken for granted.  Anyone who wants a ""safe"" film should just put the Miike box down and walk away.  Of course, weird does not always guarantee good.

Okada Izo was an actual historical figure, a samurai from the late Edo period and one of the most feared assassins of his time.  He met a messy end, being tortured and crucified, thus ensuring his transformation into a legend.  Gosha Hideo chronicled Izo's life and death in the 1969 film ""Hitokiri.""  Miike Takashi took the challenge of filming Izo's afterlife, setting his film ""Izo"" as a direct sequel to the earlier Gosha movie.

The story begins with Izo's death and the resurrection of his angry spirit, which is propelled backwards and forwards in time and space on a perpetual killing spree.  Izo himself does not really understand the motivations of his actions, being guided by some other force, and while he is able to feel pain he can never die again.  He only slaughters, becoming more and more demon-like in appearance (and super-hero-like, complete with mask and cape) and his killing continues.  His ultimate target is thought to be the group that controls humanity, the military, media, scholars and religious figures who conspire to keep people ignorant and controllable.  Towards the end though, Izo has completely forgotten what he is trying to accomplish, and just cuts down anyone in front of him.

In order to create some buzz and interest in a somewhat esoteric project, the producers of ""Izo"" went with a ""dream team"" casting of pairing popular auteur Kitano ""Beat"" Takeshi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fireworks/dp/1567302238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fireworks</a>) with the rogue director Miike Takashi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Audition/dp/B0009WFEDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Audition</a>).  This duo alone had massive drawing power, although they decided to hedge their bets by sticking in other stars like Momoi Kaori (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-and-Honor/dp/B0012SY0E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love and Honor</a>), Matsuda Ryuhei (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cutie-Honey-The-Movie-Live-Action/dp/B000N6UEQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cutie Honey - The Movie (Live Action)</a>) and even popular K-1 fighter Bob Sapp.

With this in mind, ""Izo"" is packed with great bits.  Surprisingly, Kitano Takeshi gets very little screen time.  From the advertising, I would have thought he was a main character, but his is only a minor role.  The Bob Sapp battle was very cool, and there are several outstanding sequences. One really great piece of ""Izo"" was the interstitial sequences of the ""screaming philosopher"" and acid-folk guitarist&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tomokawa-Kazuki/dp/B000RO53IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tomokawa Kazuki</a>.  His particular voice and style of music added a perfect grounding point to the chaos of the film.

Ultimately, however, ""Izo"" just didn't really work for me.  I could see what Miike was trying to accomplish (Izo as a metaphor for humanities capacity for violence.  The thought-controlling group that dictates what people think.  How ""righteous vengeance"" can deteriorate into cruel killing for killing's sake...) but it was all just too muddled together.  There were many, many great scenes, but on the whole the film was dragging and repetitive.  Izo's grand killing spree eventually just becomes...boring.

Not unless to make his point, Izo uses a sword like a meat cleaver without thinking.  The plot is just a jumble of supposedly pointed thoughts, but in the end its a film without a true plot.  The color and style are intriguing, but in the end if you want something for your DVD library - it might not be worth it.  If you want to live in anti-traditional mixed up painting, this is it.  I will pass.",1237766400,,571,4.072072072072072
8077605,3,B000AC7P3S,"It's not a martial arts movie; it is about a philosophy; a way of living and dying. Izo can be a type of demon or even a manifestation of Satan; he is in a Hell of his own creation and will never be reborn (remember, this is based on Eastern beliefs) until and unless he stops the hatred and cruelty and finds another path. As long as he allows his hatred to consume him, he will continue in Infinity for.....infinity.
If you go with the beliefs of kharma; what he does in his past lives will determine what his next life will be; his is a world filled with pain and hate that perpetuates because he knows no other way.
Having said that, I, too have to agree that Miike made his point halfway through the film and the killing did get a little tiring towards the end, but I was also intrigued enough to watch the whole thing to ensure there was nothing missed on this rather interesting ride.
Another reviewer had a valid complaint about there not being any sub-titles to the songs, which clearly carried much insight into the film's message. I think non-Japanese speakers would be able to understand the concept better if we could understand the lyrics to the bard's songs. Perhaps the newer release took care of that oversight.",1209168000,,1228,4.4622222222222225
8077606,5,B000AC7P3S,"It's hard to be familiar with the movies of Takashi Miike. Despite seeing the majority of his films released in America (and even a few that have yet to be released here), it's hard not to feel like I've lost something in translation. I can appreciate the humor, the violence, the plotlines, etc but there are usually parts that confuse me, and his movies typically require repeated watchings.  It's not that I'm particularly new to the films he creates or the films of Japanese directors in general (""Tetsuo"" creator Tsukamoto is probably my favorite director); the point I'm trying to illustrate is that you have to WANT to appreciate his films. You have to work hard sometimes to get into what he's doing, because he often throws conventional plot points, ""hooks"" that grab you, and structure out the window. Even his most fairly straightforward films take many detours into the bizarre (see the tank randomly showing up in ""Family"" or the rocket launcher that comes out on nowhere in at least two of his films!)...

So, it's not surprising that this is one of the lesser-recieved of Miike's works. Using the ""hook"" of a sword fighting epic initially gets people interested in this film, but seeing no conventional plot or point to what is happening throws people off. This confuses me -- though I definitely didn't grasp everything upon the first viewing of this, I was still instantly amazed at what Miike has set up here: A journey through one man's tortured soul. Even if you don't feel like you understand everything that's happening, you still realize this film is genius -- maybe you just haven't figured out why yet.

Upon repeated viewings, however, I figured out why. As another reviewer mentioned, you have to kind of look in between the lines. This film is powerful, epic, emotional, and even darkly comedic. On the surface, this film is basically just a journey through someone's afterlife. However, beyond that, the film pours on flashy imagery, ultraviolence, and heavy emotion to an almost suffocating degree.  In a lot of ways, this film reminds me of ""El Topo"" -- a movie that is disguised as a genre effort (El Topo being a Western, this being a samurai swordfighting film) that just uses the basic genre outlines and explores topics deeper than have ever been covered in the genre before.

I think those who overlook this film simply were expecting a straightforward swordfighting movie, which this film clearly isn't. It's way better than that, and it's honestly probably the best film to come out in the last decade.  Don't write this off after one viewing, it REQUIRES repeated viewings. A masterpiece.",1202601600,,2628,4.868008948545861
8077607,4,B000AC7P3S,"Wow, another demented head trip by Miike.  I'm not exactly sure what I just watched, but I know it was great.
You've got the fierce warrior Izo, who is brutally murdered and then his soul seeks some closure.  Or rest.  But his spirit is denied at the gates of both heaven and hell.  So the soul wanders aimlessly, trapped within himself, feeling eternally restless and bitter.  He then embarks on a ruthless rampage of death, destruction, and mayhem that is visually spectacular.
The plot linear structure is intentionally wavering and sporadic, maybe in an attempt to make you also feel lost.  There are some amazing action sequences that reminded me of Matrix, Kill Bill, and Ichi the Killer.  With this exploration of life after death comes a strong level of surrealism portrayed, which I thought was imaginative and entertaining.  I also loved the showdown between Izo and big Bob Sapp, way too cool.
This film is generous with the blood and the swordplay, but it's abstract notions and problems with continuity might not appeal to many viewers.  Oh well, may your soul burn in eternal damnation, haha.",1195344000,,1106,4.871657754010696
8077608,5,B000AC7P3S,"This film stands in a VERY select group of films that manage to achieve both a cinematic and a philosophical brilliance. This one goes right up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Matrix trilogy, The Fountain, The Seventh Seal, The Holy Mountain, El Topo, and Jacob's Ladder. I felt very lucky to have seen such a beautiful film. It's a true artistic achievement.",1193184000,,365,4.71875
