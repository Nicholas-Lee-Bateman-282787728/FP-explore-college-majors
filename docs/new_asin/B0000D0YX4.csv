1920474,5,B0000D0YX4,la vendedora de rosas is a gangster street kid movie. It is about the real gheto if you think east L.A or the bronx is gheto it is nothing compared to the gheto in colombia the gheto in colombia means you have nowere to live and you don't care if you see someone get killed couse its nothing new so if you think your gheto i dare you to go to the gheto in colombia. This is a sad movie but its the truth about how the gheto in colombia is. If you seen blood in blood out you should see what real gangsta movie is. In colombia at least 6-7 people die every day it is noting new to see someone die. I recomend this movie,1070582400,2,618,3.874015748031496
1920475,4,B0000D0YX4,"This movie is a must see.. it definitely shows the effects that children with poor family structure can easily be veered into negative influences like drugs, prostitution, homelessness etc.. in search for a loving relationship or just some attention.. I would definitely recommend parents show this movie to adolescents as an eyeopener...Both can learn from the movie..",1169337600,4,369,5.491228070175438
1920476,5,B0000D0YX4,"This is a heart-wrenching film about children in poverty, focusing on a girl who sells flowers to survive.  It is a ""feminine"" or feminist (perhaps) counterpart to the same director (Victor Gaviria)'s earlier film, ""Rodrigo D: No Future"" and one should ideally watch both.  I was enormously moved when I saw this film for the first time.  An important predecessor for other neo-realist Colombian films such as ""Our Lady of the Assassins"" and ""Maria Full of Grace.""",1156809600,6,464,5.0
1920477,5,B0000D0YX4,"Esta pelicula es de la clase de cine que uno debe tener en casa para apreciar lo que tiene en esta vida. La dolorosa experiencia de ver a 'Monica' la vendedora de rosas y los demas ninos, tratando de sobrevivir en medio de una ciudad acelerada por el dinero y las drogas y su crueldad con los mas indefensos, le aprieta a uno el alma.

La busqueda constante de los personajes por encontrarse con ese alguien y en ese sitio tan especial que los haga sentirse amados e importantes, lo lleva a uno a compartir su angustia y su deseo por ver un final feliz que no llega.

Hay que abonarle a su director el hecho de haber utilizado unicamente actores naturales. Ninguno de ellos salio de las calles. Siguen ahi. Incluso su protagonista Lady Tabares se halla presa en colombia por intento de homicidio. Otro dato importante: Giovanny Quiroz 'el zarco' lo mataron en Medellin. Durante mucho tiempo estuvo buscando una oportunidad en el mundo de la actuacion, luego de la pelicula, pero se le cerraron todas las puertas debido a su singular pasado. Nadie le dio la mano y la calle le cobro lo que le debia.

Una cinta de gran drama y ganadora de 14 premios internacionales incluidos el de festival de Cannes, el de la Habana y los premios Ariel en Mexico. La Vendedora de Rosas es para verla cuando usted sienta que quiere cambiar el mundo pero no sabe por donde empezar.  Bueno...aqui hay un inicio: ""Para que zapatos, si no hay casa?""",1152921600,4,1428,4.523255813953488
1920478,5,B0000D0YX4,"I really liked this movie, not only because of the plot, but most

importantly, because it shows you (the viewer) life outside your own.

It shows you how tough and unfair life really is. It shows you that

this is real, and it is not sugarcoated. I have to say that it is tough

to watch, because you are compelled to feel pity and sorry for the

characters in this movie. But then again, this is life, and life is

tough. It does show the ""rough"" parts of Colombia, but there is no such

thing as a perfect country. I recommend this movie. Definitely a A+.",1146787200,3,558,4.2075471698113205
1920479,5,B0000D0YX4,"Este es un filme que refleja la realidad de todo lo que pasa en muchos paises de america latina, la verdad valae la pena verlo, es una cruda realida, pero increiblemente cosas parecidas pasan en la vida real. Os invito a verlo, es un gran filme!!",1142035200,,246,4.369565217391305
1920480,3,B0000D0YX4,"Great movie? maybe not, but it is a good movie, I was blown away by the acting from these street kids, I write screen plays for Spanish short films my self, and I was told they were not trained actors, and I could not believe it, and yes there are other things to Colombia than this, but this is part of the country (any other country in Latin America)and it can not be hidden, and that is the good thing about the movie, is real, every day, every minutes, every second, is about finding a way to make money, having something to eat, a place to sleep. Things that some of us take it for granted, is about surviving! even though is by crimes.

Like I said, Good not Great!",1138752000,,671,4.161538461538462
1920481,2,B0000D0YX4,"Classic Colombian film, and as such, filled with an inherent arrogance. The film which was nothing but gold to critics is one of the most pointless film proposals I've ever seen.

This 1998 film starts off with the now boring Pulp Fiction Original idea of setting up several stories within the same context and the same characters, however, being this a film made in my country, Colombia, the whole story is pointless beyond shoving down the audience throat the fact that we live in a vicious place.

What's the conclusion of the film, violence, the whole film can be summed up with that single word. The only attempt to explore a characters mind is to the main character, with one of the most repeated ideas ever, the mother ghost, we are remembered over, and over, and over that she misses her mother. We get it OK, her mother died, she misses her, that's why she is a mess, let's move on. The pther characters are basically just cartoons of a very serious issue, the product of ignored poverty.

A bunch of ""puff the magic dragon"" kids is not art, it's not anything. The film only manages to create a scary context, but it remains as such, the film is all context, no story here, the film does not teach me anything, imagine the film as Natural Born Killers, only with a Mickey and Mallory that never philosophise, or learn anything, or do anything but get high and bully other people, with almost every line being loaded with profanity.

Colombian filmakers have made this ""works of arts"" for decades now, I'm sick of it. I'm a Colombian filmaker myself, and it burns me to see that the only stories done here are about poor drug adicts, and hookers, and hit men. There's more to this country than that, and even if you want to do a story about poor people, you can give it meaning, an important message, something, I can see that the situation is bad by just looking up at the statistics, which is what this film basically does, show the statistics only with actors.

Rodrigo D:No Futuro had the same problems, it's no trick to show poor people cursing and doing bad stuff. I would like to propose examples of movies that have used similar characters and story lines and really accomplished something. The most clear example is Amores Perros(the Mexican Pulp Fiction), the film is not only technically superior, but also develops it's characters with much more maturity, and the film says something at the end(of every storyline).

Gangs of New York is(beleive it or not) similar, a look at the most miserable places of a city, and yet look at it, the film has a huge point to it. Taxi Driver, another film that explores urban decadence, and boy does it make a strong statement.

Point is La Vendedora de Rosas only works as a gratuitous look at violence and urban decadence, a film that constructs an world with empty people inside, and if that was the point of the film, the shame on the makers, to say poor people are empty. Bottom line, this film only works for the sick curiosity of those who don't know squad about my country.

A much more objective and accurate view was ironically made by a US writer director, the guy who made Maria Full of Grace, that film really does capture the essence of my country, not Vendedora de Rosas. Now, some might call me elitist, and argue that since I'm Colombian but not poor, I can't give my view, well as I said before, I'm a filmaker, and have studied the behaviour of poor people here, and it's nowhere near the mental masturbation of Victor Gaviria(maker of Vendedora...).

For all of those who though that thos film was a very realistic approach, it's a blatant cartoon that is based on it's shock factor from the vicious people shown in the film, in order to impress simple minded audiences.

A must-miss, trust me.",1122163200,5,3770,4.571851851851852
1920482,4,B0000D0YX4,"This is the crude reality of Medellin's mean streets. There's no interesting story to follow but the scenes in this film will keep you on that chair until the end. The best part is that all of the actors are real street kids that will incure in any kind of illegal activity to survive and in some cases to support their addiction to drugs. These actors are not impersonating a character, they're just being themselves. After filming the movie 9 of the actors died violently and many others have been in jail, including the main character, Leydy Tabares.",1121817600,,553,4.653061224489796
1920483,4,B0000D0YX4,"This is an unbelievable film.  ""...Rosas"" is graphic and truly disturbing as it captures the squalid life of the gamin in Medelln, Colombia.  The children lead a life of sex, drugs, and prostitution without compunction.  They are the sad result of broken homes.  The film is a commentary on how the war on drugs has lead to the neglect of Colombia's poor.  The irony of it all, the children are not hooked on cocaine but glue.  They sniff the stuff out of paper bags, slowly depleting their young brain cells every time they use it.  A very disturbing, yet enlightening, film.  It brings awareness to a growing problem in Colombia and questions the results of the Colombian government having to concentrate its efforts fighting the drug cartels and guerrilla insurgents rather than concentrating its efforts rehabilitating the children who will surely wind up contributing to the drug-insurgency problem in the future.  The kids in the film did a wonderful job in their performance, really good acting, and the directing was very sharp, weaving the different subplots seamlessly without having to clumsily intersect them.  The film is in a sense a docudrama.  Even though the film is not as effective as ""Children of God,"" the film does succeed in making the viewer aware that there is more to the troubles in Colombia besides the things your read about in the New York Times.",1113091200,20,1376,4.887931034482759
1920484,5,B0000D0YX4,Don't miss it... Few movies can compare to this tour de force by the colombian cineast... I don't think there is a movie out there where the violence is as close to real life as in this movie... The real life in the ghetto's of colombia...

7999769,5,B0000D0YX4,"This is truly a diamond in the rough. The film has nearly no budget and the main characters, all kids, are really kids taken off the street and asked to participate in the film. The film has no script, just an overall main storyline and the kids all are encouraged to just live their lives as normal. It shows a sad reality that other movies nearly never show, and if they do, they will include a happy ending for the suffering or a consequence for one's malice. This movie more resembles real life and like real life for a child growing up in the streets of a third world country, there is no justice. This film captivated me for it's raw presentation. It's lack of attempt to sugar coat reality, and I also enjoyed the story, based on the short story by the same author of the Little Mermaid originally titled, the Little Match Seller.",1355529600,3,837,4.406451612903226
7999770,5,B0000D0YX4,A heart-wrenching film about Colombian children living in poverty. However it doesn't sugar coat the very real situation street kids were going through in the late 90's. Very powerful film but at times is very disturbing.,1341878400,2,221,5.166666666666667
7999771,3,B0000D0YX4,"While doing a wonderful job of depicting the plight of Medillin, Colombia's poverty-stricken children, I found no real redeeming qualities or values to the characters themselves. Basically, it was just a bunch of foul-mouthed, glue-sniffing kids who opposed any form of authority that older family members tried to impose on them. At least the lead character in ""Maria, Full of Grace"" found redemption of sorts in her impending motherhood.
I want to thank Mr. Alberto Diaz for his perspective and review of this film; his review helped me focus on mine a bit better.",1254528000,,566,5.031914893617022
7999772,5,B0000D0YX4,"This film has a haunting effect on those of us who have never seen how most of the world lives. It follows a street urchin, who sells flowers for a living, in the mean streets of Medellin, Colombia. The children that it follows are not actors. The film maker followed these children through their daily routines to make a splendid film, almost documentary. The leading character is a cunning 12 year old, who steals your heart.

I've purchased several copies of this film to give to others, since it's impact is so great, without being heavy handed. It's a true masterpiece, in my humble opinion. You shouldn't miss it.",1246233600,,619,4.678899082568807
