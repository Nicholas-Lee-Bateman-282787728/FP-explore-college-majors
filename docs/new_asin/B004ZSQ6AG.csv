8450445,5,B004ZSQ6AG,"This has been a GREAT addition to my jiu-jitsu game!  I was already familiar with the spider guard, but the details behind the techniques were never really explained to me.  I kind of knew ""how"" to do the moves, but not the mechanics behind those moves.  One you understand principles of spider guard, like all jiu-jitsu principles, you can start to apply them to outside-the-box situations.

There is also a section called ""Passing the Spider Guard"" which is very good as well.  I knew one or two basic passes, but Tinguinha shows many more than the standard few.

If you want to learn spider guard, advance your spider guard, and/or learn how to pass spider guard, this is a must have!",1362960000,,687,4.636363636363637
