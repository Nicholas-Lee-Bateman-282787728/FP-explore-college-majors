5980204,5,B00FEHCQKQ,"Kristanna Loken Is a superb actress giving a stellar performance.
Bruce Dern and the the beautiful young cause celebre add to the
film's luster. The film is based on a true story and should be seen
by viewers world wide to appreciate the human kindness and
determination which manifests itself in the American endeavor.

5980205,5,B00FEHCQKQ,"Bruce Dern, Kristanna Loken and Jos Mara Yazpik are brilliant. Bruce Dern has a lot of screen time, much more then I expected. I especially looked for ""Dernsies"", after learning about them from Quentin Tarantino: http://youtu.be/4hDr_bWDV1U and I found some of those. The movie is strong and beautiful. Make sure to have some tissue paper close at hand for your tears, I sure needed some. Kristanna Loken is absolutely stunning throughout the whole movie. And I believe she has the same amount of screen time as Bruce Dern. Its a joy to see them in scenes together. There is a very nice love scene between Bruce Dern's character and his characters wife, that really touched me. The scene is funny and may have a ""Dernsie""? And there are also scenes where Dern's character is showing love for his immigrant workers. They have become like his own family. And there are many more great scenes. The movie is very touching, the subject matter important and the acting is FANTASTIC! You will not regret buying this DVD! I will watch the movie again soon with friends. BTW: I added two custom images. I hope you found my short review helpful?",1387411200,4,1135,4.737373737373737
5980206,5,B00FEHCQKQ,"I was invited to the screening here in Los Angeles and was not disappointed.  This is a timely movie based on actual events.  Excellent direction, photography, screenplay and acting - I'm a big fan of Bruce Dern (if he doesn't win the Oscar this year for his current work I'll be shocked!) and he was excellent in this film as well.  Kristanna Loken is a not only beautiful and talented, but perfectly cast to play the lead and daughter of her real life father - story author Chris Loken. This movie is a must have addition to any independent film collector's library!",1386115200,3,568,4.549019607843137
5980207,5,B00FEHCQKQ,"Got to see this at a special screening and thought it was fantastic. Top notch production and directing, excellent acting and a screenplay that was topical and moving. Bruce Dern and Kristanna Loken are at the top of their form here. This should have been released nation wide in theatres, but I am happy to see that it is finally available on DVD. I really enjoyed this film.",1386028800,2,376,4.544117647058823

8614833,5,B00FEHCQKQ,"This is a film that covered a subject which I thought out to be told without closed-mindedness.
I don't want to give the story away but it covers an issue which is the same all around the world, the UK in particular.  Especially now.
One thing that impressed me was the places where the filming was shot.  The large Sequoya cactus and the other native desert plants that grow to the size of trees.  Plus of course the workplace of the main characters, the floral settings which was quite a contrast.",1413936000,,499,4.461538461538462
8614834,4,B00FEHCQKQ,Kristanna Loken & Bruce Dern make a formidable father & daughter scene in the courtroom. She is very easy on the eyes too.,1398211200,,122,4.3478260869565215
8614835,5,B00FEHCQKQ,"This film deserves to be seen a lot, because it focus on a real and affecting occurrence experienced by the great Kristanna Loken. Kristanna and the other protagonists act with passion and feeling, they truly care about problems and oppressions of who is seen as a foreigner. With this film Kristanna has made a really great and commendable thing. Kristanna's performance is as always gorgeous!!",1390521600,,395,5.092307692307692

8614837,5,B00FEHCQKQ,"A deeply moving story and visually stunning production that addresses critical and timely issues about cross border relations, on a very personal level.  Kristanna Loken, Bruce Dern, Jose Maria Yazpik, and Patricia De Leon are superb, not to mention that beautiful little girl.  The film does what few do well: it captures the essence of the human spirit--that as human beings, we fight to create better lives for our families and to protect the ones we love, beyond language or nationality.  A film like this remind us of cinemas power to open our eyes to important world issues in a way that we all can fundamentally relate to.  An absolute must see.",1390262400,,652,4.794642857142857

8614840,5,B00FEHCQKQ,"A magnificent story about a family who loves and cares for each other and the troubles our messed up immigration system has caused too many families. Kristanna Loken is fantastic and her character is a true hero in this movie. Bruce Dern,  and Jos Mara Yazpik are brilliant. A true eye opener on how destructive our immigration system has become and will amaze so many at the lengths families will go to be able to stay together.",1389916800,,429,4.571428571428571
8614841,5,B00FEHCQKQ,"Fighting for freedom is such an important film that is not only extremely entertaining and well done, it touches on the topic of our countries immigration crisis in a way in while most Americans are in the dark!
