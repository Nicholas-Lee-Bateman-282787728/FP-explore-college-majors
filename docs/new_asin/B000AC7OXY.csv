2384407,2,B000AC7OXY,"Aside from a quick breast shot, and the occasional ""bad"" word, this movie seemed to be made for ABC Family. If I was 13, I would've fully enjoyed this film. As an adult,it was kind of lackluster. The storyline was a bit rushed and unrealistic. (even for a horror film) Nick Carter is hot as hell, but he needs some acting classes. Kevin Zegers and Stacy Keach's characters are the only two worth mentioning. Judge Reinhold's performance was just plain embarrassing.  I did like the setting of the film. It took me back to when I was a teen. I will say, it wasn't boring. It did keep me entertained, but I was VERY disappointed with the overall storyline.",1135036800,,654,4.495798319327731
2384408,5,B000AC7OXY,"The Hollow, Is a perfect way to explain what the Hollow is like. Its got a Popular Singer now Actor Nick Carter from the Backstreet Boys in there. Its a really good movie. U won't be sorry if you buy it, Infact you will like it. I can bet that u will like it. Its about the Headless hoarse men. Go out and buy it.",1130112000,7,313,3.830769230769231
2384409,3,B000AC7OXY,"Unabashedly silly and obviously aimed at a young audience, THE HOLLOW is a pleasantly diverting ghost story.  Kevin Zegers (AFRAID OF THE DARK) stars as Ian Cranston, who is unknowingly a descendant of Ichabod Crane, who according to this story was real and not just a character in Washington Irvings' classic tale.  Crusty old gravekeeper Stacy Keach (hamming it up delightfully) enlists Ian's aid in making sure that the Headless Horseman is returned to his grave forever.  The movie borrows cliches from countless other treatments of this classic ghost story and while it doesn't come close to Johnny Depp's SLEEPY HOLLOW, it's a harmless entertainment.  Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys has a role as the school jock and the fake Headless Horseman; Eileen Brennan turns up in a small role as an eccentric old lady; and Judge Reinhold is pretty bad in his role as Ian's sportsminded dad.  But it wouldn't be a bad addition to your Halloween night viewing.",1129939200,10,960,4.937888198757764

2384411,2,B000AC7OXY,"The title describes what you'll feel after watching this terrible movie. It's not scary and must use a little skin to titalize, instead of horror to scare. Nick Carter is horrible, and Cuocoo is one dimentional. A really bad horror movie, that has nothing to do with Irving's classic.",1129766400,,284,4.816326530612245
2384412,4,B000AC7OXY,This movie could have been better but I have watched it a number of times and will watch it again! The young actors need more experience but all have potental.

2384413,1,B000AC7OXY,"Washington Irving's tale ""The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow"" continues to thrive and gets another new treatment. But after Irving's masterful tale, and Tim Burton's gorgeous and brilliant take on the story with his 1999 movie with Johnny Depp, what was left to do?. Well, after seeing this movie, you realize that there isn't anything left to do and this latest stab at the legend is near or at the bottom of the barrel. The Sleepy Hollow story and the Headless Horseman and all that has always been one of my top favorite stories and favorite Halloween time story. It's just wonderful. But this movie really makes a mockery of the whole thing. It's like this movie was trying to be an R rated film, but ended up feeling like a made for Hallmark movie trying to be a slasher film. I was hoping for another fun new look at the story, but this movie was just a big disappointment when I watched it when it first premiered on TV last Halloween. I know the version shown last Halloween was edited, but from the looks of things, it didn't seem like it needed much of it. I mean, how much of an R rated horror film could it of been when it was shown on The Fox Family Channel?!. There is nothing new here, and the filmmakers basically made a sloppy film that is nothing more than a bunch of cardboard kids getting slashed by a ridiculous looking Headless Horseman. What is the plot of the movie?. Well, there isn't a whole lot of it. Kevin Zegers stars as Ian Cranston(Ichabod Crane?), who learns that he is part of the Ichabod Crane family line. He and his family live in Sleepy Hollow, and Ian is the typical good kid who has the hots for the hot cheerleader(Kaley Cuoco) who is already taken, and is being pushed by his overbearing dad(Judge Reinhold). But thanks to a weird local(Stacey Keach), Ian finds out about his ancestry, and learns that the Headless Horseman has returned to take more heads. The end part of the movie takes place during the school's haunted hayride. That part was kind of cool, but as with everything else with this movie, it was not used to it's fullest potential. The whole Crane family line thing is okay, and I guess it makes sense in the modern world. But the script is so lazily and uneffectingly written, that it never makes a strong case. The characters are stereotypical cliches, and you don't care for a single one of them. Why would you?. Zegers is appealing as Ian, but it is Stacey Keach, with his hammy performance, that will end up being the only memorable one here. Backstreet Boy Nick Carter starts as Cuoco's jock/jerk/bully boyfriend. I would say that Carter should stick to singing, but I guess he shouldn't even do that. Carter's character isn't a character at all. He's just a walking, talking cliche of every high school jock/bully ever seen in a movie or TV show. I have always gotten the impression that Carter himself is kind of a hothead jerk in real life, but he can't even bring it to life on the screen. Plus, he looked horrible. Bad casting. Then there is Judge Reinhold. Don't get me wrong, I really like Judge. I always have. But he is so horribly misscast here. The father role is another cliche. He's the football coach at the high school who pushes and pushes Ian to do this and be like this and all that. The problem is that Judge has always seemed like a nice, soft kind of guy. This is a role and persona that does not fit him in any way, shape, or form. He has such a soft, whispery kind of voice, that when he gets mad and gives Ian all of his talks, it's more laughable than anything else. He can't do it. The Horseman himself is a complete joke. Why such the large pumpkin head?. Not only is that completely stupid looking, but he is dressed like some medievil jester. The whole appearance is incredibly foolish looking, and has no sense of fear or terror at all. The kills are silly and cartoonish, and none of the suspense scenes have any suspense in them. The whole movie is like a live action episode of Scooby Doo, minus the good parts. ""The Hollow"" is a hollow movie indeed. Bad acting, bad casting, and a script with no heart, depth, terror, or mystery. Just a vanilla teen flick. So, is there anything to like about it?. Not much. Besides the fun of Stacey Keach's hammy overacting and Kaley Cucoco in her cheerleading uniform(hubba hubba), there is nothing here to reccommend. This movie ends up being a major trick instead of a treat.",1125446400,10,4404,4.465260545905707
2384414,3,B000AC7OXY,"Everything was good, until I was done watching it and the disk wouldn't come out with the drawer...
I had to take the top off my DVD player and remove the disk physically. I found that in the center of the disk ring Top, had a sticky residue like something was removed from it and the adhesive was removed with it. It was STUCK to the disk pickup and wouldn't come loose on its own.
After about an hour of cleaning the crap off..., I was quickly aggravated!!!

2384419,4,B000AC7OXY,"A raving lunatic (Stacy Keach as Claus Van Ripper) tells a newly transplanted teen (Kevin Zegers as Ian Cranston) that he just happens to be a descendant of none other than Ichabod Crane!  What are the odds!?  And wouldnt you know it, Halloween is close at hand and the Headless Horseman is on the loose lopping off heads of amorous teens who think making out in a cemetery is a good thing.  As if poor Ian hasn't troubles enough with the resident bully/moron (Nick Carter as Brody) and a tyrannical father (Judge Reinhold).  All Ian wants to do is fence, act, and pursue a cheerleader (Kaley Cuoco as Karen).  First off, Im nobodys squeeze!

Not quite a slasher flick (theres far too few victims).  Almost but not quite a horror flick (the HUGE pumpkin head on the headless horseman is disproportionate and therefore ludicrous).  Plus, the story is riddled with stereotypes and clichs.  But the worse offense is the one kid youd like to see loose his head, doesnt.

Still, it has a level of amusement (intended and otherwise) that makes it worth my time to watch every October.",1475798400,,1078,4.656084656084656

2384442,2,B000AC7OXY,"This is a really bad attempt at the legendary Headless Horseman story.  I mean *really* bad.  Of extreme proportions!  The first half is about the attractive Kaley Cuoco, her uptight jock boyfriend Nick Carter and the boy Kaley she has a crush on (Kevin Zegers- and hey let's be honest guys, he *does* have that ladies man look doesn't he?) all having pointless overdramatic trivial teenage discussions.  Obviously Kaley likes Kevin but of course Nick won't have any of that nonsense.  Nope, Kaley's MY babe says Nick!  You know how it goes.  These discussions occur on Halloween night out in the woods.  Nick of course tries to scare his fellow teens and surprisingly it works.  How gullible!

Kevin likes to recite Halloween poems and scare all the neighborhood children with stories pertaining to the Headless Horseman.  Kaley is so darn cute (especially in her cheerleader outfit, and no, this is NOT a Halloween costume- while at school) that her looks alone almost make me want to give this movie a higher rating than it deserves (but luckily common sense kicks in just in time).  And Nick's character is just a total jerk.  Stacy Keach meanwhile is roaming around the woods acting unbelievably scared that the Headless Horseman is going to come out and slice everyone's heads off.  At first nobody believes him and thinks he's just telling a story to try and scare people, but...

Nothing of importance happens in the first half the film so there goes at least 2 stars, and when the Headless Horseman finally arrives we're not really frightened because the deaths look really tame.  Plus the Headless Horseman looks poor with his fake glowing eyes.  Plus he never disappears and magically reappears in different spots like he's supposed to, nor does the movie take advantage of the galloping horse feet appearing in different spots to enhance the fear level.  Nope, nothing like this occurs at all.  Even when we see a decapitated body lying on the ground, it looks really silly.  The way these teens run around the woods frightened isn't very believable.  They run around like it's just a man in a Halloween costume riding a horse.  Not the appropriate reaction.  It turns out at the very end of certain bridges the Headless Horseman won't come running on his horse, so it serves as temporary refuge.  Still, on this night the Headless Horseman is supposed to be more aggressive than usual so eventually the teens are on the run once again.

This movie also has some really awful attempts at being scary such as whenever the father of Kevin Zegers has to get up off the couch disrupting the movie he's watching and the alone time he's spending with his wife, to answer the door (since it's Halloween night and he's expecting trick or treaters).  When he opens the door he finds out nobody's there.  He has to get up a couple different times over the course of 5 minutes.  This part's overlong and fails.  No atmosphere whatsoever with weak writing.  The one scene showing a head being sliced off happens in slow motion and doesn't look remotely scary either.  Hard to believe a head being chopped off lacks scariness since that's the one thing that makes everyone gasp.

The acting is unbelievably poor and quiet.  The quietness is due to the shallow and uninteresting writing in addition to the lack of a scary atmosphere.  The characters are a cliche of every silly teen horror in history.  I highly recommend skipping this poor movie.",1442188800,,3445,4.78135593220339

Kevin Segers, Kaley Cuoco, Nick Carter, Lisa Chess, Nicholas Turturro, Joey Mazzello and others in this film have an acting history over their youthful years.  As they move towards adulthood, the positive talents and personnas possessed by them have graduated superbly.  What balanced

I read the bad reviews on here but happened to catch The Hollow on one of the cable movie channels and watched it. The movie was a tad scary but mostly it was just a fun, enjoyable movie to watch. As a matter of fact I was going to buy it to add to my DVD collection when I saw that it was already available for watching on Prime.

The critics of the film apparently are expecting their films to all be instant classics or Oscar worth films but some of the best horror films aren't. This one is an obvious continuation of the Sleep Hollow tale and reminded me a little of Ginger Snaps in its appearance, although admittedly Ginger Snaps was better.

Amazingly, no one believes him. Teens from the high school start disappearing, leading to absolutely no response from law enforcement!

2384509,3,B000AC7OXY,"An ABC Family TV Movie that draws on Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow as source material, The Hollow (2004) is a teen horror flick set in Sleepy Hollow, New York, that combines drama, humor, and horror, as the town's residents prepare for the coming of Halloween.

In the village of Sleepy Hollow, Halloween is celebrated with old style public storytelling, and on the big night, a dramatic production that involves a ""ghostly hayride"" through historic areas of the village.  High schooler Ian Cranston (Kevin Zegers) is involved in oral storytelling, dramatizing Irving's legendary tale.  He catches the attention of Karen (Kaley Cuoco), a classmate on the cheerleading squad, which causes some friction with her kind of boyfriend Broady (Nick Carter).  Claus Van Ripper (Stacey Keach) is a strange old timer, who calls Ian ""teacher"", and babbles that the boy is a descendant of Ichabod Crane.

For the Halloween production, Brody has the coveted role of the sword wielding headless horseman, but is upstaged by the appearance of another sword wielding rider with a jack-o-lantern for a head, who begins slashing off the noggins of unsuspecting victims.  With Van Ripper's assistance, Ian picks up an antique sword, and prepares to do battle with the flame headed apparition.

Van Ripper has a key role, providing insight into what is happening, and also adding some comic elements.  Although sticking a jack-o-lantern head on top of the legendary ""headless horseman"", makes for a kind of cool looking figure, it is not consistent with the legend of Sleepy Hollow.  The traditional story does however, provide the basis for a very convenient resolution.

Ex-Backstreet Boy Nick Carter, does pretty well riding a horse, while Kevin Zegers makes a suitable reluctant hero.  Kaley Cuoco (The Big Bang Theory) is perky and fun in a limited role.  The cast also includes Judge Reinhold, Nicholas Turturro, Natalia Nogulich, and a cameo by Eileen Brennan, but except for Stacey Keach as the grungy wild-eyed Van Ripper, most of the adult characters have minor roles.

The film is too mild and goofy to satisfy the serious horror crowd, but with gore and violence occasionally pushing the limits of PG-13, The Hollow is probably best suited to teens, as it may be too intense for younger children.",1280361600,,2306,5.084880636604774

Can he figure out the horseman's weakness and send him back to hall before every person in the town is decapated to the verge of oblivion. Find out in thrilling epic conclusion as the main character challanges the horse man to and old fasten mid evil duel right in the middle of sleepy hollow.

2384517,3,B000AC7OXY,"Clutching desperately at the coattails of Washington Irving's classic tale, ""The Hollow"" is a modest horror flick that will keep you entertained, either with humor (intentional and unintentional) or a few decent scares.  I originally saw this flick on ABC Family about three years ago.  It has recently popped up on Sci-Fi channel.  It's a lot better than seventy-five percent of Sci-Fi channel's flicks, but does fit comfortably in that channel's Saturday movie lineup.  It's cast has a little something for everybody.  There's new stars for the younger crowd (Kevin Zegers, Kaley Cuoco), former 80's teen stars (Judge Reinhold), an old guy (Stacey Keach) and a former boy band superstar (Nick Carter).

The story is centered around the return of Ichabod Crane's bloodline (Zegers) to the village of Sleepy Hollow.  When Halloween comes along, Zegers moves in on the high school football jock's girlfriend (Cuoco) and quickly makes an enemy out of said jock (Carter).  Teenagers go missing, and despite warnings from the cemetary keeper (Keach), the village goes on with it's Halloween Hayride, giving a returning Headless Horseman easy pickings.  Keach tries to convince Zegers that he's a descendant of Crane and that the Horseman has returned to finish a job he started many years ago.  Initially Zegers denies the possibility of being related to Crane.  As the story goes on, however, he begins to realize that he is Crane's descendant and only he can stop the Horseman from going on another killing spree.  Heads roll, there are plenty of near-misses, and Carter, Keach and Reinhold really chew up the scenery for the rest of the movie.

When all is said and done, the viewer won't feel entirely cheated by this film.  Yes, it has some very bad moments in it, but those moments are what makes this film fun.  There are also a few legitimate scares throughout for the audience.  You won't be afraid to go roaming down deserted country roads at night after seeing this movie, but you will have a pretty good time seeing just how silly and spooky this film can be.  I'd consider it a rental, especially around Halloween, if you prefer your horror a little bit on the light side.  If you can find it in the bargain bin and happen to be a fan of B-grade horror, this just might be a fun purchase.",1193443200,8,2297,4.816326530612245

2384523,2,B000AC7OXY,"This movie works if one of the following four descriptions applies to you.

1. You think Kevin Zegers is hot, you want to see anything he's in, and the swimming scene in Transamerica was the best thing to happen to you since you first had a peanut butter sandwich.

2. You think Nick Carter is hot, and want to see if he can act. (He can't.)

3. You like horror movies, no matter how bad they are, simply because it's a horror movie.

4. For some reason unbeknownst to man you are interested in what Judge Reinhold is doing with his career.

Within the first five minutes of the film I had it pegged as a Friday the 13th style movie. Within the first five minutes, it was. Then it expanded a bit, and we saw some interplay between father and son, and also some rather useless and pointless teenage romantic angst.

In this rendition, the headless horseman actually had a head. It was a pumpkin. And it growled. There was also some serious fire that he was capable of - apparently - in the beginning. This fire was not with him when he needed it the most. And, of course, he used a sword to decapitate victims

Lucky, then, that Kevin Zegers' character was on the fencing team (odd for such a small town to have a fencing team, don't you think?), and when he was able to get his hand on a sword at the very end - well - you get the picture.

Judge Reinhold was a riot in the 80s. In this movie he was a football coach who talked about how things were when he played ball. I can't imagine a universe in which Reinhold played the kind of football he was talking to his players about. He would have died during his first game. He did, though, walk around the house with a football jersey on, and some silly pajama pants, so I guess that fit the role of a football coach. Still.

All-in-all, I was certain that this review would be a one star review. Then it came out of the ""Jason woods"", and became marginally better.

I was interested in the film for two reasons. First, I'm still waiting to see if Kevin Zegers can act. I have a feeling that he's going to break out of the horror mold he's in and become a lesser Jamie Lee Curtis. Unfortunately, in Transamerica they had him play a petulant teenager. They didn't give him room - i.e., they didn't write anything for him - that would have allowed him to express any range. Either that or he doesn't have any. Second, I do like horror films, even bad ones. Which this was. Just because I enjoy bad horror films doesn't make it a good movie. Which this wasn't.

I was just about to post this review, then saw the three, four, and five star reviews. I'm sorry - what were you guys smoking when you watched this? Are you kidding me? As a bad horror film, this succeeds. But bad horror films don't get three, four, or five star reviews. It's insane.",1151539200,5,2792,4.258979206049149

If you enjoy teen slasher flicks or if your favorite member of the Backstreet boys is Nick Carter because he plays a big role in this movie. It is a must have for any backstreet boys fan. If you purchase this movie you won't be sorry, i am even thinking about buying another one for a friend on mine. So if you don't have this DVD secured in your collection what are waiting for, it's just a click away.",1142812800,5,521,4.22
2384525,4,B000AC7OXY,"The Hollow, which is loosely based on the Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a nice addition to the growing number of small budget, strait to DVD horror movies out there. With a nicely assembled cast, passable special effects, and a well paced plot, this movie stands heads (hahah) over the competition in this horror genre.

When Ian Cranson moves to Sleepy Hollow, he has no idea that he is the last descendent of Ichabod Crane, and he thinks that when he begins getting warnings from the town crazy, that he'll just shrug them off, but soon he and the town can't deny that some legends are real, and some horror won't rest.

This is a really good movie, better than some recent horror movies that have made it to theater. It isn't scary, really, or overly horrifying, but its light and quick and leaves you feeling like you wouldn't mind watching it again.

So if you're looking for a good, quick horror movie to fill your time, don't pass this up just because there's a Backstreet Boy in it (Nick Carter). It's really good!

2384526,2,B000AC7OXY,"The Hollow seemed like it would be a great horror movie but in my opinion,it wasn't. The legend of sleepy hollow is brought back to us in this low budget redention of the classic. A couple of good scenes but overall, it could have been so much better. Poorly shot and just not a good horror movie. I was let down.",1141516800,,313,4.147540983606557
2384527,3,B000AC7OXY,"File this one under: Great concept, mediocre execution. The story is about Ian Cranston, a High School kid who carries the bloodline of Ichabod Crane. As soon as Ian moves into Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman returns to life to finish the Cranes off once and for all. Kind of a neat little idea, and it could have been fun movie but the concept got lost somewhere along the line.

It's hard to pinpoint what's wrong with the Hollow. For the most part, it's shot pretty well. There are some scenes that are really dark and grainy, but for the most part the movie looks better than most of these low budget horror flicks. I can't really fault the actors, even though Nick Carter is nobody's idea of a talented thespian and whoever thought casting Judge Reinhold as a football coach should be fired immediately. But the movie is carried pretty solidly by hottie Kevin Zegers and the girl from 8 Simple Rules. The real standout as far as acting goes is Stacey Keach, who really seems to be having a lot of fun with the role of the old grave keeper. I can't fault the writing, because while it's a little clichd at times, there is a solid pacing to the story.

I think the problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up. Part horror movie and part after school special, it winds up feeling like an R.L. Stine Goosebumps episode with some nudity in it. The Hollow's biggest flaw is that it's uneven. The next biggest flaw is the way the Headless Horseman looks. He has a head, for one thing... and it's a completely ridiculous looking pumpkin head. As it is, the Hollow is worth a rental if you're a fan of the old Disney cartoon and are interested in seeing a modern day retelling of the story. I don't plan on adding it to my collection, but if you have kids that are like in their early teens, they might enjoy watching it on Halloween night.",1137542400,3,1882,4.3742857142857146

8077749,5,B000AC7OXY,"Fun horror movie about the Legend of The Headless Horseman. Kevin Zegers does a great job as the lead likable hero. Nick Carter portrays the high school jock jerk who is great. Kaley Cucoo(Penny From Bing Bang) does a great acting job as the female lead in one of her early roles. Stacy Keach(Body Bags, Roadgames) steals the show with his Irish accent and helping Kevin Zegers against The Headless Horsemen. The movie is mildly scary.

  The gore is kept to a minimum but this movie should scare young children ages under 10. It's a fun B movie with some good actors Elizabeth Brennan, Nicolas Turtoro is small supporting roles. Kevin Zegers did a great job but the one that put everything into it was Stacy Keach and he helped elevate this movie with his acting talent and knack for character roles. Great movie for Halloween. Cheers and Enjoy!",1500681600,,846,4.6644295302013425
