6339190,1,B00J8LXD7E,"I knew this wasn't related to the Brendan Fraser Mummy trilogy, but I wanted to watch it anyway to see if it had a 'so bad its good' vibe. Trust me, it doesn't. The acting and dialog is cringeworthy. The story makes no sense and it just randomly ends. A woman named Maggie, along with her friends, meets up with her archaeologist dad who hasn't seen her in 20 years because he's out 'exploring'  They enter a tomb, and for some reason the dad is possessed and tries to resurrect a mummy, without any reason. Do not watch THE MUMMY RESURRECTED!!!",1402099200,3,545,4.396039603960396
6339191,1,B00J8LXD7E,"This masterpiece of marketing deception has nothing to do with the popular Mummy series of films.

Maggie (Lauren Bronleewe) can't wait to meet her estranged father of about 20 years. Tralane (Stuart Rigby) is an archeologist whose daughter follows in his foot steps. He wants to locate the tomb of the cursed sorcerer whose name has been removed from all records. He is ""The Nameless One"" apparently more evil than ""he who which we do not speak"". He does have an ominous Anubis head.

Maggie and Tralane take along 5 pieces of eye candy to go on the dig near the Libyan border. As fate would have it our gang gets trapped inside a fairly well lit tomb.

The acting and plot were bad. The dialogue was horrible. While not as nearly as good as the popular series, it was better than ""Isis Rising...""

Might want to skip this one, even as a rental.

6339192,1,B00J8LXD7E,"This is awful. The title makes you think it's somehow related the Mummy series staring Brendan Fraser. Well, it's not. The actors are completely wooden and terrible, the main guy is really out there. I can't believe I'm even wasting my time reviewing this, but I wasted my time renting it, so I might as well. The run time is very short. It says 84 minutes but the ending credits rolled at 72 minutes for me. Is there some kind of director's cut out there?",1400198400,13,456,4.376470588235295
6339193,1,B00J8LXD7E,"I won't rubbish this movie to much why would I want to be the only one to suffer. When I saw the females that were to be in this mess and caught some of the inane dialogue  I knew I was in for it. Then our star (using the term loosely ) opened his mouth and a strange British accent was heard I actually looked to see if there was a shadow on the wall anyplace where the person with the cue cards may have been located. None so the effort on his part was all his fault. I won't go on to much about how bad this movie is but if you have a list of the worse movies of all time add this clunker to it there is nothing that I can say that sums up how weak and pathetic the whole thing is .

6339209,2,B00J8LXD7E,The movie could've been much better I mean five of the main actors where women. A young woman and her friends meet her Father for the very first time he takes them A dig to A tomb of an Egyptian queen. The setting especially the tomb where poor I mean were was all the art the ancient Egyptian tombs were known to have but also each of the team has A dream of A ghost or A mummy before they die. Now here's the strange the professor and his daughter looks like they survive but the daughter kills one of her friends survived A near death fait just to be killed be the daughter to wake the dead Queen after that the father and his daughter leave the tomb threw A secret passage and when they get out she looks back and see's her father disappear into dust and then she walks away.

8648758,3,B00J8LXD7E,"I don't want to say ""I don't like it"" but I would really like to give it only two stars.
The story, of course, is Bram Stoker's novel The Jewel of the Seven Stars&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jewel-Of-Seven-Stars-The-Most-Complete-Version-Ever-Published-Includes-The-Endings-From-The-Original-First-Edition-And-The-Revised-Second-Edition/dp/143828747X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jewel Of Seven Stars - The Most Complete Version Ever Published: Includes The Endings From The Original First Edition And The Revised Second Edition</a>&nbsp;though nowhere in the credits is this ever acknowledged by the makers of this thing.
And shame on all those reviewers before me who didn't even recognize it. Guess they must have been distracted by the attractive girls in this thing (and they ARE quite attractive).

Anyway, yeah it's Stoker's novel brought to film for at least the third time...previous versions of this were Bram Stoker's Legend of the Mummy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bram-Stoker-s-Legend-of-the-Mummy/dp/B00TK2YQEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bram Stoker's Legend of the Mummy</a>&nbsp;from 1998 starring Louis Gossett, Jr. Amy Locain as ""Maggie"" (or ""Margaret"") and the late Lloyd Bochner as her father, Professor Trelawney. Richard Karn (from HOME IMPROVEMENT) shows off his acting chops as a fellow Egyptologist and expert on Egyptian Occultism and does a FINE job!

Then there was THE AWAKENING (1980)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Awakening/dp/B0082G8SLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Awakening</a>&nbsp;starring Charlton Heston as the Professor and Stephanie Zimbalist (not yet of REMINGTON STEELE) as Maggie.

And before that we had 1971's Blood from the Mummy's Tomb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-From-the-Mummy-s-Tomb/dp/B00005KHJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood From the Mummy's Tomb</a>&nbsp;with Andrew Keir as the Professor, Valerie Leon as Margaret, and Olive Gregg as Margaret's voice. (Like Ursula Andress in Doctor No,  Valerie's accent and unfamiliarity with English meant her voice had to be dubbed,)
A delightful in-joke in this one is the role played by Mark Edwards. The name they gave his character was ""Tod Browning"" which is also the name of the man who directed Bela Lugosi in Dracula (1931).

For these reasons any reviewer who writes that the ending of The Mummy Resurrected was ""obscure"" or ""didn't make sense"" gets no sympathy from me. If you're a fan of these kinds of films you damn well should have RECOGNIZED the plot straight off. What with the seven stars references, the Archaeologist dad, the daughter named Margaret, and the ""tomb of the nameless one"" who was ""said to have been a powerful sorcerer/sorceress,""

Why did I like it?
I liked the way it ended.
And I liked Stuart Rigby (Meet the Spartans 2008) Birmingham, England's answer to Tom Cruise (yes, Stu really IS from the UK).

No, It isn't that good...though there are a few moments that can send a frisson of fear up your spine...but it isn't AWFUL either.",1443484800,,3166,6.400468384074942
