2380947,2,B000A9QK9Q,"Good:
- The picture quality is better.
- Watching the three movies (The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, Way of the Dragon) in Chinese with English subtitles is much more entertaining.

Bad:
- Game of Death II shouldn't be included.  This is NOT Bruce Lee movie.
- The sound quality is tooooo over enhanced.  The ""Kiaiii ohcha ohcha"" voice of Bruce Lee is NOT real anymore.  My brother watched ""The Big Boss"" with me and he asked me ""Why the sound come before the voice?"".

Don't waste money on the Ultimate Collection.  The Master Collection is still better.  Buy The Bruce Lee Master Collection & Enter The Dragon (Two Disk version), you will have a complete set of good Bruce Lee movie.",1131840000,8,680,4.524590163934426
2380948,2,B000A9QK9Q,"Once again after shelling out money for the definitive dvd set of Bruce Lee's Films, I've been ripped off again. The best american versions released to date, are the 5 disc set originally released by Fox. They contain Chinese Connection (Fist of Fury), Fists of Fury (The Big Boss), Return of the Dragon (Way of the Dragon)and Game of Death (which I never liked and considered a rip-off from the start). This new set is a region 1 NTSC release of the region 2 PAL release by Fortune Star.  The sound on all of these movies is over-enhanced, and what is it with that english translation song on Chinese Connection (Fist of Fury)not to mention that the color saturation on Chinese Connection is poor and a little on the green side. Although, the color saturation and picture quality was a little red in the original Fox release, at least they kept it classic.  Way of the Dragon changed all of Bruce's original cat calls (Kiai's). It sounds like they even had to dub Bruce's cat calls to fit in with this new improved version. The sound in the scene with the double Nunchaku, was terribly over enhanced (made it sound like there was a tornado behind him)

Maybe oneday, someone will get it right and restore these films correctly with homage to the great master. (leave out game of death and game of death II UGHHHHHH, and use the original soundtrack but boost it to 5.1 dolby, like they did in the Wizard of Oz, so we know it can be done properly)",1129680000,78,1446,4.490494296577947
2380949,3,B000A9QK9Q,"Okay...this is an improvement over the previous box set...as the films feature a greatly improved picture and sound options..BUT..the foreign sets available though amazon.co.uk have great packaging...very cool book and documentaries NOT included in this set...heck there are NONE on this set.  I also note that while the menus look identical to  the  foreign set (I guess you can  tell I own  both?)...to watch it with the original language and English subtitles...on the foreign set they are below  the picture on these...ON THE PICTURE? ..why? when you have a widescreen do you need to put the subtitles on  the images? They didn't on my import...
this is a pretty half a...ed effort on  20th Century Fox. and I  agree the last movie in particular is a joke and insult to Mr Lee. It doesn't  need inclusion.

I notice some folks take issue with ""Imports"" ..there is a difference between official licensed DVDs and ""bootlegs"" the items I am discussing are the DVDs available through Amazon.co.uk and are legit and its  NOT  just that there are extra DVDs for every movie but the picture is alarmingly BETTER (think BLURAY to VHS better) ...the US set is worth the 10bucks you pay for it but if you are a real fan of Mr Lee and this series of movies you can own versions which run circles around what we are offered in the USA. This is not the only series of films which find  better and more  restored or better quality outside of the US...and this isn't opinion but fact.",1129593600,157,1473,4.655038759689923
2380950,4,B000A9QK9Q,"I don't think these movie should be included in the ultimate collection.  These two films are more of a hodgepodge patchwork of Lee mixed with cuts of some other guy.  The movie is not Lee's original vision and was put together after his death with a few scenes that he shot before Enter the Dragon.  This set is worth it for the first three films, but also make sure to pick up the special edition of Enter the Dragon which includes the documentary ""Curse of the Dragon"" and the final battle from Game of Death.",1129593600,2,512,4.368421052631579
2380951,4,B000A9QK9Q,It appears that The Chinese Connection is included under the title Fist of Fury (the UK title).  The Big Boss is another title for Fists of Fury (plural).,1129507200,2,154,4.5
2380952,5,B000A9QK9Q,"Set does include Chinese Connection, first reviewer doesn't know what they are talking about... the Chinese name for Chinese Connection is Fist of Fury and the American name for the Big Boss is Fist of Fury... my advise to the reviewer Oh Yeah is learn what you are talking about before you write a review.",1129420800,4,306,4.581818181818182
2380953,3,B000A9QK9Q,"How can this be the ""Ultimate"" colection when it does not include the ""Chinese Connection""?  Far from ultimate. ""Enter the Dragon"" is also missing, but understandably, as it is from a different studio from the rest.

Why bother including ""Game of Death 2""?

The older boxset is better. It includes ""Chinese Connection"".",1129334400,2,319,5.096153846153846

2380984,3,B000A9QK9Q,"Not as good picture and/audio as the separate individual releases by Fox. I also own the individual release by Fox of Return of the Dragon (AKA The Way of the Dragon). The Return of the Dragon version is a much better one since it has re-mastered sound and picture. At some points, I thought that when this movies where transferred into this compilation, Fox did not own the rights yet. The Fox logo is only shown at the beginning of each movie. The end credits do not show or mention 20th Century Fox Inc. Nevertheless, the picture and audio are average compared to other versions I've seen. Also, note that all movies for this collection are in the widescreen format 2.35:1 aspect ratio. They are also in dubbed English with optional English subtitles. One thing I don't like is that the subtitles do not match the actual dubbed dialogue, which makes it very confusing. As a big fan of Bruce Lee, I had to get this one, which contains ALL but one of Bruce Lee's greatest movies. Enter the Dragon is owned by Warner Bros and therefore has to be bought separately.",1482969600,,1064,4.546875

2380987,4,B000A9QK9Q,"Bruce Lee was the man when I grew up in the 1970s. Nobody was cooler. We all wanted to be Bruce. And as many times as I'd seen Fist of Fury and the rest, I wanted to see them with Lee's real voice and original soundtrack. That dubbed voice sounded so dumb, at least after I grew up and wasn't 12 anymore. And that was the reason I pursued buying this product. Alas, it doesn't have that option. The DVD menu shows multiple options for language, but The Big Boss certainly had just one setting, and that was that dumb dubbing. However, the quality of the recording was great at least on my big screen TV, and I didn't care about the voice. My wife even watched the entire film with me again. And I bought it used, so price wasn't a concern. I'm satisfied with the product, but I'm still looking for the original recordings.",1470528000,4,822,4.2756410256410255

2381016,4,B000A9QK9Q,"I was glad I was able to find this. I was able to save a lot more money buying this collection rather than buying them separately. These are also the only versions of the movies that I could find that included Mandarin and Cantonese which is what I wanted. Not that English dubbed crap.

There are just a couple cons I need to point out. First of all, very occasionally there will be a slight mistake with the English subtitles. For example, In ""The Big Boss"", when Bruce Lee's character is being introduced to the group of guys in the beginning of the film. When the last guy introduces himself he says his name and then something like ""I'm the smart one"". However the English subtitles do not include that part. According to the subtitles he just introduces himself. Another example in one of the movies (I forget which one) there is a scene when the subtitles is slightly delayed in showing up for a moment only allowing viewers to read the whole sentence for a couple seconds (I hope you are a fast reader). Another con is that the audio quality for ""Game of Death"" is very poor even on 5.1.",1435449600,,1095,4.420792079207921

2381018,2,B000A9QK9Q,Missing 'Game of Death I.'  Disc was replaced by a duplicate of an earlier film.  There are so many differently named versions of these films it is ridiculous.  I suggest you carefully buy one movie at a time to get what you actually want.  The included 'Game of Death 2' is not a Bruce Lee film.  It is a few bits of unfinished work filled out with stunt doubles.,1425945600,,364,4.217391304347826

Sadly, due to Bruce Lee's actual death during filming, the only part of ""Game of Death"" that was any good, was the scene where he (the actual Bruce Lee)was climbing the tower and fighting a thug on each level.

2381240,5,B000A9QK9Q,"This is a great way to own all of Bruce Lee's movies (except for Enter the Dragon) for a low price! If you're skeptical about the quality of these DVDs, rest assured that the image quality is pretty darn good as far as old Hong Kong movies go. All of the movies are in 2.35 anamorphic widescreen. The Big Boss looks very sharp with rich colors. Way of the Dragon looks a little ""softer"", but this is most likely due to the film quality itself rather than the transfer. Game of Death looks great, with sharp detail and good contrast. In addition, you get optional Cantonese audio tracks as well as the original Mandarin audio tracks. I've read one reviewer state that Bruce Lee's war cries are screwed up on the DTS tracks. I only watched these movies with the Mandarin mono audio tracks and I didn't notice anything fishy about the cat calls. So if the English dolby tracks are screwed up, you can always watch them with the original Mandarin tracks; they should be unaffected.

One thing I should point out is the English audio track on Game of Death (which was the original language of the movie) is not very clear and you may need to turn on English subtitles to understand what characters are saying at some points in the film, but again I think this is due to original quality of the dialogue rather than the transfer.

If you don't have any Bruce Lee movies and want to see what all the fuss is about or if you want to acquire a complete collection, buy this set! You won't regret it! Don't let a couple of very unforgiving reviewers cast any doubts in your mind. This is as good as you're gonna get for a domestic release.

It has the original chinese (which I later found out is still dubbed for a majority of the films), so you don't have to listen to the bad American voices in the english dub. However, the one big draw back is that it does NOT include game of death; you'll have to buy that separately. Personally I only like the first three films; ""Game of Death"", and ""Game of Death II"" were made after Bruce died. ""Game of Death"" has some shots of Bruce, and a lot with a body double (it's very obvious when the double is used). ""Game of Death II"" has no Bruce in it at all.",1268697600,,610,4.049586776859504

2381273,5,B000A9QK9Q,"Finally there is an almost perfect collection of Bruce Lees best films.  I have thoroughly enjoyed these films through the years viewing them in the typical grainy picture and muffled sound.  What you get with this set is noting like that.

These are the titles you get all with there original titles which is another plus in my book:

The Big Boss (aka Fists of Fury): Basically Cheng (Bruce Lee) moves from the city to his cousins to work in an ice factory.  He is welcomed as long as he promises to not get involvd in a fight.  Soon his cousins start coming up missing.  It seems the manager is behind it.  Then the action starts.  Bruce Lees first film and is done similar to an exploitation film, nudity, violence, murder you get the idea.  Basically the studio at this time did not know who they had and how he would be received.  Overall 3 1/2 stars.

Fists of Fury (aka Chinese Connection): Chen (Bruce Lee) comes to visit his school and finds his master is dead.  At this time there is much conflict between a Japanese school and Chen's school.  During the funeral memebers of the Japanese school offer a challenge to anyone that feels they can beat them in a fight.  Next scene Chen beats up the whole school.  Soon Chen finds out the Japanese school may be responsible for the death of his teacher.  The hunt begins.  The best movie IMO of Bruce Lee's career.  Here the studio fully realizes the talent they have and sticks with a true martial arts classic.  5 stars.

The Way of the Dragon (aka The Return of the Dragon): The story revolves around a restaurant owned by his uncle.  Soon local Soprano type thugs want some kick back for his success.  Soon they start roughing up his uncle and try to shut down his business. Tang (Bruce Lee) to the rescue.  Bruce Lee wrote and directed this movie and many consider this to be his greatest film, it difinitely made the most money.  Also you get to see a legendary matchup Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris.  Overall 5 stars.

Game of Death: ***OK Lee was in the middle of filming this movie when he was approached to star in the legendary Enter the Dragon.  With an almost unheard of budget for a movie of this type Lee could not refuse.  After filming he soon returned to work on the Game of Death, but died before completing it.*** Billy Lo (Bruce Lee) is approached by a rough group wanting him to join them.  When he refuses accidents start suddenly happening around him. He soon has to go into disguise including plastic surgery.(This is how the alternate actor gets introduced)  This movie was meant to show how Lee's fighting style Jeet Kune Do could be the match for any other type of style.  Which brings us to why this movie is worth watching the last 11 minutes in the tower.  This is where the actual Bruce Lee shows up and beats a different style of martial arts on each level of the tower with his Jeet Kune Do.  This is also where he wheres his signature yellow jump suit.  For the last 11 minutes I give it 3 stars.

Game of Death 2: Bruce Lee was already dead by this point and this film is simply a filler in this set filled with old footage dubbed together to attempt another Lee film, it fails miserably.

Overall, this collection is a must own for Lee fans.  Picture quality is the best I have seen on any Lee films thus far.  Couple that with having the option of the original language track with english subs and even the purest can be happy.  Me I have a media room that loves the new 5.1 sound track because they have amped the sound way up so that each powerful punch can be felt.  For this price you cannot go wrong.  Buy this with Enter the Dragon and you own yourself a legends legacy.  I cannot recommend this enough.  Buy it now!",1236211200,4,3713,4.3654970760233915

This collection has Lee's three best Hong Kong movies, and his unfinished ""Game of Death"" - which only is of interest because of the included Lee footage. I have no interest of Game of Death II, which only seems to exist due to Lee's fame. I also like that they finally fixed the naming of the movies to their intended names. ""The Chinese Connection"" and ""Return of the Dragon"" never seemed appropriate.
The quality is great, the dubbing is good (although I prefer subtitles). Get this with ""Enter the Dragon"" and have a great Bruce Lee collection.",1223424000,,738,4.684615384615385

2381314,5,B000A9QK9Q,"Back in 1984, I had only heard of Bruce Lee and seen snipets of his films via Berry Gordy's The Last Dragon. In 1993, I saw Enter The Dragon for the first time and was hooked from day one!

I used to have these same films on the original Bruce Lee - The Master's Collection but this one is actually better because it comes with the original chinese (cantonese) dialog with english subtitles on his first three films! Plus, many scenes that were originally cut from the American versions of The Big Boss, Fists Of Fury and Way Of The Dragon have been restored, making it almost a brand new film (at least for me).

Here are the films you'll get here:

THE BIG BOSS (aka Fist Of Fury) - Chang (Bruce Lee) comes to live with family friends in order to stay out of trouble but when he learns that a corrupt business owner of an ice factory is smuggling drugs and has his friends murdered for interfering in his affairs, Chang takes matters into his own hands! The final scene is shown in its entirety, making it much more dramatic and bloodier than the original one that was shown for years in America.

FISTS OF FURY (aka The Chinese Connection) - This one has a lot of historical basis to it that I didn't know before. Bruce plays Chen Zhen, a student of real-life martial arts legend Huo Yuanjia (played by Jet Li in the recent film Fearless). After learning that his beloved teacher has died, Bruce discovers that a Japanese headmaster at a rival school was behind it. In honor of Huo, goes on a virtual deathwalk to avenge his beloved sifu (meaning teacher in chinese).

The character of Chen, though ficticious, is based on a real student of Huo's named Liu Zhen-Sheng whose life is said to have mirrored the Lee character.

WAY OF THE DRAGON (aka Return Of The Dragon) - In this one, Bruce plays Tang Lung. A well meaning country man from Hong Kong who comes to help out a family friend from gangsters who want to take her restaurant.

In this one, its the first and only time that Bruce uses two nunchuks in battle and he also faces off on-camera with Bob Wall (his future ""opponent"" in Enter The Dragon). This, of course, features his famous battle with Chuck Norris.

THE GAME OF DEATH - Billy Lo is a top martial arts expert and movie actor who is marked by a syndicate. After an attempt on his life, Billy lets the world think he's dead in order to take down this criminal organization.

Made after his death, it is really a cheesy tribute to Bruce. If you've ever seen Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey, then you know that the way the film was made isn't even close to what Bruce originally wanted for the movie. The only reason to watch this one is to see his scenes that he did finish for this project. My personal recommendation is to get Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey or get the 2 disc special edition of Enter The Dragon which also comes with that documentary. That way, you can see what they did in Game Of Death and then see what the footage was supposed to look like!

GAME OF DEATH 2 - Good if you have an hour and a half to waste. Best way to watch this is forget that its connected to Bruce in any way. The fight scenes aren't actually that bad but it gets a little hokey near the end. Good for one viewing.

Overall, this is a great package to get. Highly recommend watching the first three films in its original chinese (cantonese) language. You'll be glad you did and the films will make more sense too. Both Game Of Death's, however, do not have this option.

Still, a good package to get and its actually better than Bruce Lee: The Master Collection.",1205884800,4,3573,4.356390977443609
2381315,5,B000A9QK9Q,"This is an excellent collection by 20th Century Fox, Region 2 - English, wide-screen, English 5.1 DTS/DTS/Original 2.0, with Chinese sound track option (Cantonese, Mandarin) and English subtitle.  The English sound track is good, but I prefer Chinese with English subtitle; picture resolution is great also.  The collection includes The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, Way of the Dragon, Game of Death, and Game of Death II.  I've read all the review here and found comment such as the restaurant scene in Way of the Dragon was cut; only shown Bruce Lee went in and out; that was not true.  I read one of the review and had an impression that this collection does not have Chinese language option with English subtitle and that Bruce Lee - The Master Collection has that option.  Well, I search and found Bruce Lee and The Master Collection on eBay (8 disks with The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, and 6 others.)  I thought it contains all Bruce Lee movies with Chinese language option and English subtitle and bought it.  That was a BIG mistake, because this is not the same as Bruce Lee - The Master Collection that was mentioned here.  The Big Boss and Fist of Fury are the only two movies (no Chinese and English subtitle); 6 other disks are junks.  I then searched for the UK IMPORT version, but it's expensive and high shipping cost.  I found a Hong Kong version, but was not sure whether they have English subtitle; S/H is $20.  I went back and read the reviews again found one or two mentioned Chinese with English subtitle with a complaint that the subtitle is on the picture, which I don't really mind as long as I can hear Chinese (I don't understand Chinese, but I got turned off with the terrible English dub).  I took a chance and bought the collection.  I am really happy with this collection, great picture, wide-screen, and Chinese language option (not available for Game of Death I & II which I don't care too much for either one.)  I already had Enter the Dragon (only wish that it has Chinese language option).

For the first time ever, We get to view all of Bruce Lee's classics in their original language! From The Big Boss [Known in america as Fists Of Fury] to Game Of Death, This is the ideal box set for any Bruce Lee fan, The release of this rendered the master collection utterly worthless. Another plus of these movies are that these are not the original american prints [Thank God!], These are the original Hong Kong prints. Bruce Lee is a pure delight to watch in all of these movies. His ferocious fury is undeniably exciting on the screen [Especially in Way Of The Dragon aka Return Of The Dragon] and it's no wonder why Lee is still considered the greatest martial artist of all time. But, Like many DVD releases, Even this seemingly perfect box set has its flaws. The sufficient lack of special features is a surefire dissapointment [Especially when you take into consideration its expensive $40-$50 price tag] and the biggest flaw of them all is that for some surely retarded reason, The embarrassing and blasphemous Game Of Death 2 is included here! Game Of Death 2 is the sure reject of this set, As it is nothing more than a lost cause of a martial arts film that relies heavily on stock footage of Bruce Lee [Taken from Enter The Dragon, A film i would've loved to've seen on this set, But it can't be put on here because Warner Brothers owns the rights to that movie] to pretty much be another pointless cash-in on Bruce Lee's legacy that would make Bruce Lee roll over in his grave! But, This is a mostly satisfying box set which does feature Bruce Lee at his peak and i surely reccomend it to Bruce Lee fans or Martial fans in general. Here's my quick ratings rundown on all 5 of these movies:

The Big Boss [Fists Of Fury]***1/2
Fist Of Fury [The Chinese Connection]***1/2 [Do not watch this in english, Watch it in chinese with the subtitles, You'll be glad you did]
Way Of The Dragon [Return Of The Dragon]****1/2 [Bruce's second best film, Enter The Dragon is the only Bruce Lee film better than this]
Game Of Death ****
Game Of Death 2 No Stars [Why couldn't a good Bruce Lee documentary been put on here instead of this mind-numbingly terrible movie?!!!]

All in all, This is a pretty good box set, It's surely the best Bruce Lee box set that's on the market right now by far. Keep in mind that there are many inferior, low-quality DVD copies of Fists Of Fury and Chinese Connection circulating all through america right now by means of many obscure DVD companies [No specific studio owns the rights to these 2 movies]. Only on this box set, Will you get those 2 movies in their rightful forms. And another thing to point out is that the movies in this box set appear in top-of-the-line form meaning that the sound quality is great on all of the movies and they all look superb in terms of picture quality and let's face it, Isn't it about time that Bruce Lee's movies get the treatments they deserve over here in america? If you want almost all of Bruce Lee's movies in one shot, Get this box set now.",1193270400,8,3115,4.463157894736842

This and Enter the Dragon is all I need to start with for my collection.  Bruce is a legend, and to have a set like this is good enough in my opinion.",1175472000,2,289,4.107142857142857
2381353,2,B000A9QK9Q,"Fortunes Star actually has the audacity to include Game of Death and Game of Death II. Those are not Bruce Lee movies.  The first Game of Death would have actually been a decent film had they not tried to capitalize on Bruce Lee. They completely changed the story, and removed the great dialog in the fighting scenes that Bruce Lee had filmed himself. It also has some really bad special effects. Do they seriously expect us to believe that a cardboard cutout of Bruce Lee can come close the real vibrancy of Bruce? Game of Death II is just a ridiculously bad movie.

The other three movies, worthy of being part of this collection are: The Big Boss (AKA Fists of Fury), Fist of Fury (AKA Chinese Connection), and The Way of the Dragon (AKA Return of the Dragon). I've seen previous DVDs of the first two movies from a company called GoodTimes, and the transfers here look much better. Most of it is clean, although you might be able to see some small pixelization artifacts up close. Looking a few feet away though, you may not notice the them.

The sound quality is another big disappointment. The only good Track is the Cantonese soundtrack. The Mandarin soundtrack sounds like it's coming from a record player, complete with reoccurring pops, which is an annoying sound artifact typical to that type of equipment. The English soundtracks on all but the Game of Death movies are junk. The voices are low and the sound effects sound super low quality and way over done. It's not even worth watching the movie in English. Therefore I suggest that to get the most out of this collection, watch it with Audio Track 3: Chinese (Cantonese). Then select English Subtitles. While this is a bit of a pain, it's better than watching the movie with the English audio.

This is the first time I've seen The Way of the Dragon. I must say I was disappointed. I can see that Bruce fit in his instructional points and some humor, but it's ultimately boring and lacking excitement. The story is second rate with a focus on Chinese propaganda and the fighting scenes look fake. I think if Fists of Fury, Chinese Connection, and especially Enter the Dragon (not included in this collection) are his best.

Considering how most of the collection is of poor quality, I wouldn't buy this again.",1174867200,2,2275,4.635235732009925
2381354,1,B000A9QK9Q,"I do not know who wrote these reviews but after viewing this collection I was compelled to write this review. I am a fan of Bruce lee and his movies and to have someone come out with this low quality imitation of remastered videos is a disgrace to his legacy. The sounds were almost comical. The real insult is to put special features on each video and to see that there are none. I clicked on the special features on every video and there were no specials. I wish I could not give it one star but I have to in order to write this. Be very careful if you get this collection and know you get what you pay for.

2381356,4,B000A9QK9Q,"What can I say. I bought imports before and got burnt.

Suffice it to say, this is possibly the next best thing to own. Here, you get to actually watch the movies in the original languages, with the exception of Game of Death and Game of Death II, but they were always done in English and is not a big loss.

Having the original Chinese language is great on many fronts. First off, the dubbing that was done before in English was horrendous as it always has been. Plus, some things are changed from the story line when they translate it as they try to match the lip movements to the English words.

Also, because of the translation, this sometimes causes other scenes to be thrown out. Case in point is in Way of the Dragon/Return of the Dragon. When Bruce's character is standing outside the restaurant with his stomach growling, a man comes out and tells him to go on inside. In the American version, we see Bruce go in and then come out again, apparently after having eaten. Well, an entire scene was missed in where he goes into the restaurant to order food and can't speak a word of English, but that's what the waitress speaks in and what the menu is in. The entire exchange is hilarious. It also drives home the point that Bruce's character is out of place in Rome which makes more sense with many of the scenes in the movie which seemed strange when spoken in the English language.

Now, it would have been nice to have more ""extras"" other than the filler stuff they have here, which is basically slide shows, trailers and interviews with people. I understand the import versions have much more, but for me, this coupled with the 2-disc Enter the Dragon DVD makes my Bruce Lee collection complete.

With the Ultimate Collection, you get a new 5.1 English soundtrack but at times, it sounds funny during the fight scenes. Specifically, it sounds like the fight is taking place in a tunnel with the reverberation turned on a little too much I guess. It can be kind of distracting and disorienting with the way it sounds, but it's not a total loss. Still, the Chinese soundtrack is better. Different music and it just flows better.

The Chinese soundtracks are fine and make the movies much more enjoyable for me because you get to hear the true emotions of the actors. Some have complained about the subtitles being within the movie rather than in the black bars below. This is because these movies are in anamorphic wide screen, so on a HDTV, you'd have no black bars. To me, it's not that bad. That's how it would have been in the theaters to begin with anyways.

The picture for each of the movies are great, with the exception of Way of the Dragon. Early on, parts of it are fuzzy and out of focus. Now, this could be due to the camera shot itself because it's not the entire shot that's out of focus, but it's not enough to be completely horrible or unwatchable. But, after you get past that point in Way of the Dragon, the picture is great just like in all the other movies.

The only unwatchable things are the Game of Death (minus the final fights with the REAL Bruce of course) and Game of Death II and we all know why that is. If you really want to see how the Game of Death fights were, get the 2-disc Enter the Dragon DVD which contains at least 30 minutes of the fights in the order they would have happened, including his side kicks that were supposed to come along with him but were left out of the GOD movie for obvious reasons. It's a very interesting introspective on what Bruce was trying to envision with Game of Death and it's a shame it was never completed the way he wanted it. Plus, all the interviews up to that point are great, with Chuck Norris, Kareem Abdul Jabar and so many other former students and martial artists that knew and worked with Bruce Lee.

To me, this set is worth 4 stars. It could have gotten 5 stars with some extra content and the strange 5.1 sounds hurt that as well, but overall, this is worth having. Couple this with the 2-disc DVD of Enter the Dragon and it's completely worth 5 stars.

There is no better bargain in the states than this.",1167696000,73,4097,4.3931398416886545
2381357,4,B000A9QK9Q,"The sublime movements, the spine-chilling stunts, the languid but delicate movements, it's all there. Hats off to Mr. Lee for giving another classic.",1154044800,,149,5.521739130434782
2381388,4,B000A9QK9Q,"Listen these aren't as good or deluxe as the U.K. HK Legends versions, but how could anyone say the previous American versions of these are better? I mean ""Way Of The Dragon"" has almost ten min of great comedic scenes restored. The interviews are interesting, and while I would of liked to see the Euro scenes of ""G.O.D. 1"" on here, it is still the best set yet. Would I buy the HK Legends editions if they came out here, yes. Will this set entertain me in the meantime, yes. I also must defend including both G.O.D. films. They are part of the campy fun of the era and I actually like the plots. Sure they could have been better, but they shouldn't be forgoten.",1151625600,5,662,4.304
2381389,4,B000A9QK9Q,"There is still yet to be an ultimate collection.  The Master Collection, release several years ago, had the US released versions and the documentry ""The Legend"" relased in the late 80's and was a good start to a collection.  It did lack, however, many of the extras we cosumers are used to with DVDs.  I was hoping this version would have more in way of ""celebrity & martial arts interviews"" as advertized. Besides the blurred  digitized focus in the beggining of Way of the Dragon, the pitcure quality has been ""cleaned"" and is sharper than before.

But why should I be surprised it fails in this area?  Because while the Hong Kong influence is there (sadly, almost always doing things on the cheap), 20th Century Fox also has its is labele on the box and one could think they would have put more effort in the ""outtakes"", interviews, etc., by wielding more influence.  This part of the DVD package warrants possibly two stars at best.

Missing in the previous released version in America are the many teaser trailers and this was nice as well as the slide show.

For Bruce Lee fans, the great thing is having the international versions of these beloved films (of which, Way of the Dragon is probably the most desired and liked because there is so much of Bruce's influence in the film).  Some other criticism have been noted (like the sound effects), but all in all, more than worth owning for the fan.

A definitive version, however, is still missing. When it is ever made, hopfully next time around when they repackage it again for new consumer consumption, it will add some great interviews and and leave out the horrible Game of Death II.",1149984000,4,1644,4.63448275862069

His comrades tries to defeat the tall guy but failed. In the end, the trio walk down the stairs of the fighting place. In GD II, Bruce Lee isn't even there, only Dragon Lee the chicken. The best is The Way of the Dragon. It is tottaly funny. Like the part where the Italian fat guy bangs his head on the chaku or the two chained stick things, he tried to imitate Bruce Lee but he didn't know how to use the sticks.

2381396,5,B000A9QK9Q,"The picture quality is, for the most part, leaps and bounds above anything offered in region 1 (United States) and because it is true anamorphic widescreen, the subtitles have to be displayed over the movie. There are no black bars encoded into the image.

The picture quality on The Big Boss (AKA Fists of Fury) and Fist of Fury (AKA The Chinese Connection) look great to me and are far better than any of the many versions of these films that I have owned on DVD. The Way of the Dragon (AKA The Return of the Dragon) is generally of very good quality as well, except for certain segments such as the beginning scenes that go out of focus here and there.

I agree that some of the audio (the hitting and kicking sounds and nunchaku) is over enhanced on the English 5.1 and DTS soundtracks but aside from the nunchaku tornado sound and the deeper bass sound of the hitting, the new enhancements are more realistic and less like the bang of a firecracker exploding. If you choose the Cantonese or Mandarin soundtracks, then the enhanced effects are not present. The bottom line is that you have multiple tracks and options on this set with the only drawback being no choice to eliminate the enhanced sound from the English tracks. Personally, I think that some of the enhancement is an improvement over the phony original sound that was like that of two boards slapping together whenever someone was hit. One of the things that have made these movies seem lower in quality has always been the quality of the dubbed soundtracks. Even the original Mandarin tracks were dubbed completely by voiceover actors in the original productions of the films. They shot without sound on the sets and did everything in post. The sound on the English tracks are an earnest attempt to add quality to the soundtrack. My criticism is that they did not always sync the new enhancements perfectly and they left the old sounds remain behind them.

As a long time Bruce Lee fan I highly recommend this set. The quality of the films is restored and goes a long way toward making these movies enjoyable as opposed to unbearable.",1134172800,14,2103,4.632707774798928
2381397,4,B000A9QK9Q,"OK...bein' a bigger fan of Bruce Lee than I am of sound, picture, this, that, and the other...I'm gonna take a sec to keep it real. Having owned the Bruce Lee Master Collection prior to this one, the Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection is LOADED(with REAL language options, deleted scenes, and outtakes)! This collection is a dream come true for me, because I'd always wanted to watch the movies in Cantonese with English subtitles(and see what the characters were REALLY saying...a heck of a difference between the Cantonese and the Americanized version). The only shortcomings, of course, are the obvious overdubbing of the ""Enter the Dragon"" Bruce Lee yells grafted into The Big Boss(kinda subtracted from it's authenticity...ie, the fight in the ice house,Bruce 'howls' away, but he's only gritting his teeth...lol) and while I've managed to live with Game of Death I & II(childhood favorites...in spite of the lookalikes, cardboard cuto-outs, and exploitation/fictionalization of Bruce Lee's life & death)being included, they could've at least given GODeath 1 some sound(very poor in comparison to GODeath from the Master Collection) and the outtakes would've been a lot better with the actual dialogue(ie, Warrior's Journey). If Game of Death I & II leave you NAUSEATED, I strongly recommend Goodbye,Bruce Lee: His Last Game of Death(yeup, it stars Ho Chuong Tao aka Bruce Li, but it's come closest to what Bruce Lee's intended for GODeath in my opinion...even if his track suit is too baggy, after all, in either case, it aint BRUCE!)
