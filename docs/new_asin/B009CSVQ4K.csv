5315440,3,B009CSVQ4K,"Three years ago, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos burned up the festival circuit with Dogtooth, a brilliant isolationist allegory about adult-age children who are kept on the family compound by parents who control (and wildly distort) information from the outside world. Alps is Lanthimos's disappointing follow up. Where the earlier film concerned young characters finally trying to break out of their proscribed roles, the new one is about a woman who desperately hangs on to false identities, because her real life gives her no satisfaction. In Dogtooth the eldest daughter finds a way of escaping. Here the same actress attempts to break into a home. Aggeliki Papoulia, who played the eldest sibling in Dogtooth, stars as a hospital nurse who moonlights as the member of the eponymous organization, which provides an unusual service: the recently bereaved can hire Papoulia or one of her three colleagues for a few hours a day to stand in as their deceased loved one, as a way of easing the transition.

None of the group are known by any names. The group consist of 4 people,the nurse,a gymnast,a coach and a paramedic who call themselves `Alps' because it doesn't describe what they do,and like the Alps it can replace other mountains,but cannot itself be replaced. They are semioticians who stand for something else. Dogtooth was about semiotic corruption,rather than overbearing parenting and the film worked on its own terms. Vagueness enters into the motivation or organisation of the group. How do they manage to function while holding other jobs down?The acting and execution of the scenes is excellent,but the characters have no personality,so its tough to remember who is playing who for which family and so on. There is skill in orchestrating these tense,creepy, shockingly funny set-pieces as there was in Dogtooth. Though Dogtooth features an entirely made-up world, full of false word definitions and nonexistent threats, it's carried across by a rigorous internal logic that's conspicuously absent from Alps. There's no sense of how this service ever works, and only a scant indication of the miseries from which Papoulia is trying to escape by assuming a new identity.

As with Dogtooth, Alps picks up right when the system is finally starting to break down. Though this shadowy organization has a strict protocol--and enforces it physically, if necessary--Papoulia catches wind of a teenage tennis player who dies on her way to the hospital, and she offers her services independently of the group. It says something about the sad contours of her own life that she would invest herself so deeply in the robotic charade of imitating someone else's. Papoulia's life, the nature of the business, the impact it has on the bereaved-Lanthimos presents it all as a great human mystery, a series of strangely comic (or just plain strange) encounters that aren't engineered for a clean resolution. The nurse in some ways is the central character: she plays a dutiful daughter, a devoted partner/ colleague/friend. However she gets over-involved,steps outside the strict rules,she wants to get into a relationship. She is cast out of the group. She has a breakdown and rehearsed dialogue,set-piece conversation pours out of her like ticker-tape,but now without focus and without reason. Is her father really her father?Why does she attempt to seduce him?

It is a carbon-copy of Dogtooth, but where the wooden performances, flat framing, and general awkwardness complimented the story, it doesn't do that here at all. The concept is these actors are supposed to fill the role of other people, which is hardly convincing when everyone is so robotic. I suppose you could say that the stiffness is in how unfulfilling their real lives are, or something, but I feel it's stretch. Is Alps about our inability to deal with the finality of death? Is it about the way humans assume roles to escape themselves? Is it satirising the lack of authenticity in the modern world? It lacks focus. Of course a film doesn't have to be about one thing, but I think Lanthimos is touching on a few things in an extremely scattershot way,because if any of it was revealed with any more clarity the movie just wouldn't work because it's so absurd and pointless. Too quirky by half with no follow-through. This film blurs the distinction between reality and fabrication. It tries to show how meanings are made,reality represented. It just doesn't work.",1373068800,3,4437,5.100412654745529
5315441,5,B009CSVQ4K,"""Alps"" is an incredible film, although it is challenging and unusual when compared to American films. It asks a lot of the viewer; the premise is high-concept, the events of the film unfold at a measured pace, and the film does NOT hold your hand while you watch it, you have to pick up on subtle clues pretty much the whole way through. If you are willing to accept those things, this film might be right up your alley. If you want a lot of action and classic dramatic performances, you should probably look elsewhere. However, ""Alps"" is dramatic and peppered with funny quirky moments that have caused it to stick with me since the first time I saw it. To powerful effect, director Lanthimos uses his high concept to examine loss, loneliness, performance, and the impossibility of replacing a lost loved one.",1364083200,4,810,4.671328671328672
5315442,3,B009CSVQ4K,"""darkly comic, absurdist vision of (in) human relationships""

This is my second movie from Giorgos Lanthimas, director of 2010's ""Dogtooth"" which I saw and mostly enjoyed.  Dogtooth had some laugh-out-loud moments of absurdity, that really got you thinking.  The plot was sort of like examining a homeschooling experiment that went terribly wrong, and for that alone it was interesting.  Unfortunately at times closer to the end of the movie, it didn't really seem to know WHERE it wanted to go.  The hard right turns for the ""heck of it"" just seemed incongruent with the earlier flow of the movie.

Unfortunately Alps seems to suffer from some of the same negatives as Dogtooth without many of the positives.  For me, there were no laugh-out-loud moments in this movie.  Despite the ""darkly comic"" description in the Amazon tag line, this movie was mostly just dark and not so comic.  On top of that, the approach that seemed to add to Dogtooth's appeal just got a bit tiring with this movie.  The staccato delivery of monotone lines (used to decent effect in Dogtooth) just got old after a while in this movie. In Dogtooth, the children raised in isolation, trapped in their sealed-off existence, seemed compelled to speak in small barks, for fear they would get smacked by their father.  There didn't seem to be a good reason all the characters in this movie would approach verbal communication in the same way as the characters in Dogtooth.

I also found the performances the actors gave kind of flat, but to be fair, I also think the director intended the characters to be flat, maybe beaten down by life, emotionally scarred, scared to live their OWN lives, etc, blah-blah. I've seen both the female leads in two different movies a piece now, and I'm not sure they could radiate warmth if their lives depended on it (""Attenberg"" being the third movie, which the ""Alps"" director, Lanthimas, actually has a bit role in as well).  I'd be curious if they could do a comedy.

Having a little more insight into the movie, a family friend in Greece knows both the director and main actress, and supposedly his approach includes a fair amount of improv (not so much of a solid script). I think that somewhat worked in Dogtooth, but here the excessive meandering really didn't appeal to me.  There was interesting filming, framing and balancing of the elements on the screen, but the rest just didn't do much for me.  Sometimes absurd is interesting.  Sometimes it's just absurd.  For me this unfortunately leaned more towards the latter.  And the movie didn't really end, it just stopped.  Sometimes that's intentional, and sometimes you just get the feeling the director just didn't know where to go. Again, more the latter than the former.

So why did I give it 2.5 stars?  For being something different from all the excessively clich crap that comes out of Hollyweed, and I didn't hate it.  I just didn't enjoy it that much.  If you're one for a nice, cleanly developed and executed story arc, with real character empathy, this probably isn't the movie for you.  Greece is in a much bleaker place than 10 or 15 years ago, and maybe this just captures some of that.  If you're depressed and lonely, and have problems relating to real people, this might be up your alley.",1361145600,4,3270,4.763765541740675
5315443,4,B009CSVQ4K,"Despite having certain reservations about parts of the film's construction and narrative, I almost feel an aching need to praise the film first and foremost for being unique and not shying away from attempting something different.  Director Yorgos Lanthimos is one to watch for.  He gave us `Dogtooth' back in 2010 (I prefer that to this) and with both these features he has given us a unique vision and established himself as a breath of fresh air, even if the air he presents to us is stained (purposefully) with a twinge of musk.

`Alps' is in reference to the name of a group who service the families of the newly deceased by filling in for the dead loved one.  They take over for a few hours a few days a week by reenacting moments shared or daily activities in order to help the grieving move on.  The group, which consists of four very different individuals, starts to unravel when one of the members, a nurse named Anna, starts to become overly attached to her position and seek stability through it.  We can see the effect her `services' has on her mental stability and eventually it all catalysts into a chaotic and quite jarring finale.

I'm not sure if character development is something that Lanthimos was really going for, for the prose itself takes center stage throughout, but one issue I did have with the film as a whole was that outside of Anna it felt almost bare I that department.  While the other members of the group clearly had their distinct personality traits and narratives, they didn't really feel as fleshed out or as involved as Anna, who was undeniably the soul of the film.  Her emotional demise is such a brilliant piece of filmmaking because it really helps string together all aspects of the film leading up to it.

The robotic nature of enactments, the reclusive suggestions in personality, the voyeuristic nature of the cinematography, the need for assurance; all of which comes through in Anna's descent.

Labed (who was outstanding in `Attenberg') and Papoulia (who plays Anna here) are both excellent in their respective roles and bring a lot of depth to their characters.  Servetalis and Vekris don't work so well (especially Servetalis, who I felt was almost dopy in his approach) and so they do take away from the impact of the film for me.  Still, it is beautifully shot (that cinematography is remarkably effective) and it is very smartly crafted with an expressive vision that is a nice change of pace from the norm we see presented in film today.  I wholeheartedly look forward to the next thing Lanthimos offers me.",1358726400,3,2564,4.7325842696629215
5315444,1,B009CSVQ4K,"A very dull story line, very dull characters and the worse pacing you could see in a movie. It was very disappointing.",1356566400,2,118,4.409090909090909
5315445,5,B009CSVQ4K,"Without a doubt, director Yorgos Lanthimos has a creative and fertile mind that generates films which provide evidence of his great imagination. For those who remember, he was responsible for the Oscar-nominated ""Dogtooth"" in 2009. He returns now with another personal project: ""Alps,"" an honest, intriguing and passionate drama - spiked with funny moments - that examines ""the process of mourning,"" in an unconventional way.

The film's characters are introduced one by one, and, after that, we learn about their motivations. We first meet a ballerina, practicing in front of her demanding trainer. She begs him to allow her to dance a pop song, and he doesn't allow her claiming that she is not ready. We then move to a young female tennis player that had an accident and is taken to the emergency room. Once in the hospital, the ambulance man tells a nurse that he just brought in an injured tennis player. It turns out that the gymnast, her trainer, the ambulance driver, and the nurse have one thing in common: they run a business in which they substitute for dead people until their family is able to adjust to their absence. They named themselves Alps, and each one has a codename in reference to one of the Alps' mountains. The main character is Anna - codename: Monte Rosa --, the nurse (Aggeliki Papoulia, who was also showcased in ""Dogtooth""), and it is precisely her, the one that with time is affected psychologically, making her make mistakes that will alter the group's functionality.

""Alps"" is different and original, which allowed the movie to win the Best Screenplay Award at the Venice Festival. This is one film that will definitely leave you thinking once you finish watching it. Will this be the future, too, as the one presented in ""Dogtooth""? (Greece, 2011, color, 94 min plus trailer's time).
