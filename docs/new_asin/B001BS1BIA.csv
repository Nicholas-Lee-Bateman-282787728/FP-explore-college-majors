The only sad part was being on a bus with some Cincinnati fans going back to the hotel. We were all gracious to them.",1490572800,,311,4.098360655737705

8284335,5,B001BS1BIA,I really enjoy this DVD championship game video.  This DVD video tell me that 49 ers third championship game and win the third Super Bowl.  The DVD video tell me the memory and the history of championship of the 49 ERS.,1380758400,,219,4.317073170731708
8284336,2,B001BS1BIA,This is a 55 minute documentary about the season leading up to Superbowl XXIII. The game summary never mentioned Tim Krumrie's game changing injury or the 49ers' amazing defensive stand when the Bangals had 1st & Goal inside the 5 and walked away without scoring. This is one of my most disappointing purchases - especially considering the product description at the time explicitly stated that it was the actual game.,1355529600,2,418,4.985714285714286
8284337,5,B001BS1BIA,"America's Game is a wonderful series produced by NFL films that follows each Superbowl winning team through their season.  The other reviewer seems to think this series is about the Superbowls themselves, which it is not.  I highly recommend this series to fans.

(Check it out on Hulu for free!)",1332115200,,296,4.88
8284338,1,B001BS1BIA,"This is total false advertising.  The dvd contains a lot of information about the 49ers 1988 season, but almost nothing about the actual Super Bowl.  The Bengals are barely even acknowledged, while only a few minutes of the game are actually shown.  It hardly mentions anything that happends before the final drive.

This should have included informatin about both teams and shown the entire Super Bowl from start to finish.  Instead it makes it seem like Super Bowl XXIII only had one team and the game only lasted a few minutes.  What a joke.",1308614400,,544,4.73404255319149
