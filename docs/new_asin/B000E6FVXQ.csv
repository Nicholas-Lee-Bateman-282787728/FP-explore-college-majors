8106735,5,B000E6FVXQ,"Ms. Cameron was a remarkable woman, drawn to photography by financial necessity, she has left us a treasure trove of the souls who came to MT and suffered to make their dreams come true.  Her pictures capture a moment of time and world in such a special way.  She was one of those women who lived outside her time.  This doc allows us into her simple, beautiful and often harsh world she loved so in Eastern Montana in the early part of this century.",1310860800,2,450,4.333333333333333
8106736,5,B000E6FVXQ,I definately enjoyed this DVD. I have already owned the Photographing Montana for several years and read it thoroughly so it was very interesting to see a visual interpretation on DVD. The actors were very good and it was interesting to see the town of Terry Montana and some additional photos I had not seen before. Having footage of the badlands and area surrounding Terry also gave insight to the type of environment and conditions in which Evelyn lived. I thought that the idea of not showing the actresses face until the end was also a good idea and let the viewer make up his/her own mind for interpretation. Wonderful watch.,1299196800,3,631,4.693693693693693
8106737,5,B000E6FVXQ,"I first heard of Evelyn Cameron when I was driving through Montana and happened to stop at a rest stop near Terry where they had an exhibit on her. Being a photographer myself (mainly birds), my curiosity was piqued so I looked her up when I got home. This DVD is very well put together, includes many of her photos, along with bits of reenactment of her life throughout. It's a quality production and definitely worthwhile if you're at all interested in learning about this extraordinary woman.",1218758400,7,495,4.7011494252873565
