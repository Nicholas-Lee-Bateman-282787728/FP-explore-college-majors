5973063,5,B00FAI3GOE,"Unless you're a total prude, what's not to love about this series? While the main character, Hakufu, is kind of a ditz, she comes through when it's really important. Her mom seems to know a lot more than she lets on, and although she's a ""minor"" character, is nonetheless quite important. The rest of the supporting cast is great, too! I have the first 2 seasons, and finally gave in to buying this one, even though I think it's overpriced. I also purchased season 4 at a much lower/better price, and eagerly await its delivery!",1404691200,,528,4.568421052631579
5973064,5,B00FAI3GOE,this 3rd season was much better than dragon  destiny thanks to a much better story line and the return of the original voice actors who did a much better job  than dragon destiny crew the usal nudeity and violene were here as well this best compares to the classic 1st season,1400025600,2,275,4.372549019607843
5973065,5,B00FAI3GOE,I like this season and can't wait to get the 4th season. I like all episode that I have seen.,1398038400,,93,3.7
5973066,5,B00FAI3GOE,"The battles and adventures of the Ikki Tousen crowd continue. And yes, there's plenty of ""everything"" that we have all come to expect: lots of action and fighting, and lots of fan service. If you liked the first 2, you'll enjoy this one too. If you haven't seen the earlier ones, go back and see those first.",1396224000,,308,4.421052631578948
5973067,3,B00FAI3GOE,"Usually, I rate any show with T&A pretty low. Not that I rate ""general T&A"" pretty low. It's just that I can go anywhere else for the sake of T&A. I'm one of those people who don't wanna feel like they wasted my ""SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY, DAMN YOU!!"" money. I'd like a good story and good characters that rewards viewers with T&A instead of the other way around.

The Ikki Tousen series isn't necessarily bad; ala ""Koihime Musou series and it's 'WE HATE (YOUNG) MEN' stigma"" bad. It's mainly a series about people with pasts of ancient Chinese warriors either repeating history, fighting against it, or getting revenge because of it. The idea with ""the main female characters wiping the floor with nameless thugs"" hurts my head and they need to stop IMMHO.

I appreciate FUNi picking up where Media Blasters fumbled; but I find the dissing of Media Blasters stupid. They're a good company and the only brave one capable of dubbing adult anime via Kitty Media.",1390953600,,955,4.678571428571429
5973068,4,B00FAI3GOE,"I happened to discover the third series was out by chance. I was initially was like, 'oh, Anime Works finally got their finances in order and released it.' Then I realized it was put out by Funimation. Since Ikki Tousen has been through the hands of Geneon, Anime Works, and now Funimation, I'm keeping my fingers crossed nothing happens between now and March when the fourth season is released.
Now, as for the third season, I'm keeping it short as to not give out too much info.
The third season is not as good as the first two seasons. The artwork is great and I'm glad they managed to get some of the original voice actors from season 1 back. But...
The first two seasons the stories were fast paced, the fight scenes kicked ass, and the fan service was over the top. Now they just meander their way through the story, the fights are a bit lack luster, even the fan service is not as good. Maybe the writers are running out of steam.

But, I'm still glad they released it and I'm happy to have it in my collection. And I'm looking forward to the fourth season.",1390176000,8,1064,4.346733668341709
5973069,5,B00FAI3GOE,I loved this series since I first saw the first season and I cant wait for the fourth and i highly recommend this to all who love anime.,1389139200,,136,3.892857142857143
5973070,5,B00FAI3GOE,"Once again, I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed the newest English release of Ikki Tousen. Great Guardians follows the first two collections as one of my favorite series. This time, it re-introduced us to a more ""fleshed-out"" character brought back from death. (I won't go into plot details as it would spoil it for others.) It was nice to have this character back as I felt she added a bit more scope to one of the other characters. Even though this was a great set, it's plot was not quite as good as the first two, but still very nice. If you like Ikki Tousen, you'll like this!",1388534400,3,584,4.318181818181818

5973072,3,B00FAI3GOE,"Takes place between Ikki Tousen #1 and Dragon Destiny (DD), adds characters with some flashbacks to the past; those flashbacks are annoying in that they differ some from the actual  show.  The video and audio are good and maintains the ""R"" rating this series is known for.  I just expected them to do something more spectacular with this and was disappointed.  Just okay.",1447113600,,371,4.841269841269841

5973080,5,B00FAI3GOE,"As you probably noticed from previous seasons; ikki tousen has a very good story line (then again I'm not a critic) While it has lots of fan service... If you watched season 2 you probably noticed that it has less blatant fan skin and panty shots compared to the first one (excluding the sex scene)

Personally if the story is good I don't really care whether it has fan service or not. I could watch and enjoy this anime and all it's seasons many many times and notice something different everytime. It's just that good!

Another note: this one is in English with some of the season 2 voice actors returning (which wasn't dubbed by funimation) and most of Funimations actors. Very nice to finally have it translated beyond sub titles.",1405123200,,735,4.603053435114504

8613794,4,B00FAI3GOE,"This is a decent series for this type of thing, if not the best. Moderately sexy, the scenes' fan service are no more problematical than a lingerie catalogue or a day at the beach. That the girls are all beauties with incredible, well-endowed figures is certainly pleasant to watch (the art is great, & beauty is always pleasing) and the story is a fairly good one, if not overwhelmingly dramatic. Ikki Tousen is light entertainment with some humor, enjoyable graphics of beautiful people, with fight scenes that amply show off their female assets, and a story thread that gives all of this a reason for being. It's not the greatest drama in the world, but you don't watch such things as this for that reason. It's not as cute, sexy, funny, or dramatic as ""Rosario + Vampire,"" and certainly doesn't have the deep, dark drama of the ""Freezing"" series, but is an adequate lighter version of those titles.  All in all, Ikki Tousen is charming to watch with graphic scenes and characters that will catch your eye, tickle your fancy, and a story that is just heavy and involved enough to keep it all together. If you like this genre, you'll enjoy this.",1453420800,,1147,4.650246305418719
