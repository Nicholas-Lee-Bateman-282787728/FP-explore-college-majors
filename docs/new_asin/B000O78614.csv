2792574,3,B000O78614,"Seasons 1 & 2 are brilliant - the writing is so crisp & intelligent, though the wife (Sarah) & her shenanigans just become irritating. Was really surprised what I found so wonderful in first two seasons just turns incredibly tiresome in season 3 & season 4 is just execrable, which is only word I can use to describe how shockingly awful series becomes - unfunny, labored, stupid. Too bad superlative level of endeavour shown at beginning cldnt be continued til end - still, first two seasons are most definitely worth rewatching.",1366934400,,530,4.835164835164835
2792575,5,B000O78614,"Saw this in Amsterdam on BBC (not our water downed version) 15 years ago and waited a full 10 years before I was able to get my hands on it...but not before ranting to anyone I knew about how amazing this series was. How appropriate to release it during the horrid Bush years...except that Rik Mayall is smart. Alan B'Stard is outright and unapologetically corrupt: rigging the election, blackmailing his peers, selling state secrets, arranging the disappearances of his enemies, and stealing, extorting, and embezzling from his own constituents while hurting babies and hitting on everything around him.  This man is satisfyingly horrible and gut bustingly funny. He even frames his wife after murdering the lover she bragged about leaving him for. Never fear, he has met his match in Sarah and it's a great story arc how she gets him back, which of course means he owes her one. Their back and forth revenge chemistry, great dialogue and well written stories compliment some serious comedy genius. And who doesn't love Rik in everything he does? He was the only good thing about Drop Dead Fred. The only thing missing from this series is Ade Edmondson.",1365984000,2,1154,4.887755102040816
2792576,5,B000O78614,"I'd forgotten how much fun ""The New Statesman"" was.  Sharp wit and lots of familiar faces if you're a fan of British comedy at all.  Rik Mayall is great at portraying the ultimate political cad.  Check out his early work in ""The Young Ones"" and my personal favourite ""Bottom"".",1285113600,,276,4.591836734693878
2792577,5,B000O78614,"I rate this up there with Yes, Minister, & Father Ted as some of the best stuff to come out of Britain.  It is just inconcievable that the Right Wing in this country could ever get skewered in the manner they seem to get away with in Britain.  My favorite moment has to be when Mayall is with Hugh Laurie & Steven Fry at Mussolini's...or maybe it's when B'stard is shaking down the Nazi he has been protecting for his gold stash...'It wasn't 40,000.  It was only 37,000!'  Oh, there are so many golden moments!",1221436800,5,510,4.336842105263158
2792578,3,B000O78614,"I WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN I LEARNED THIS FIRST RATE BRITCOM WOULD BE RELEASED, IN ITS ENTIRETY, ON DVD. BUT THE SOUND LEVELS GO UP AND DOWN, AND MUCH OF THE CLEVER DIALOGUE IS LOST DUE TO LOUD SOUND EFFECTS, BACKGROUND NOISE AND MUSIC, AND THE INTRUSIVE LAUGH TRACK. THIS COULD ALL HAVE BEEN ALLEVIATED BY SUBTITLES OR CC - NEITHER OF WHICH IS PROVIDED. A SHAME.",1186099200,12,358,4.358208955223881
2792579,5,B000O78614,"I've been to the UK a few times. Last time was in 1993. There I picked up PAL VHS copies of a show called the New Statesman. Never heard of it, but I loved Rik from the Young Ones so I gave it a shot. One of the BEST British comedies never to be shown in the US. A treat for Doctor Who fans is that Pat Troughon's son, David, is one of the co-stars.

Just get it. You won't be sorry.",1182816000,6,383,3.6707317073170733
2792580,5,B000O78614,"I'm so excited I can't stand it! Britcom aficianados (sp?) are in for a special treat. Rik Mayall's vicious and viciously funny New Statesman is finally coming to DVD.  If you've only ever seen RM on Young Ones or Bottom, the new character is very different.  But there are plenty of trademark Mayall-isms.  The propensity for shouting, the sexual morals of a rabid mink in heat, cheating, lying, victimizing the terminally stupid, blackmail, insults so clever and cutting in their wording that you gasp in admiration.  The part that hurts?  He almost always gets what he wants; he's a winner.  Not fair, is it.",1177200000,17,611,4.826923076923077
2792581,4,B000O78614,"This video is superb. It mixes a degree of hilarious slapstick and extreamely witty word play in what could be construed as a very mundane context. The New Statesman is the best kind of satire, taking problems and attitudes which actually exist within society and excentuating them. The result is hilarious and often quite hard-hitting. The New Statesman shows Rik Mayalls ability to sparkle as a sophisticated, corrupt politician Alan B'stard as well as the more anarchic roles which he ussually fills, some of the most memorable being Rick Dangerous and Richard Richard. This is testiment to his versatillity and general brilliance as an  ac-tor (sic). Howvever, this role also allows him to perpetrate a satisfying amount of violent acts upon his wet inbread best friend Piers Fletcher-Dervish(Micheal Troguhton), so hopefully he doesnt feel to far from home.",980640000,,862,5.246376811594203

2792583,4,B000O78614,"A fine send-up of the more rabidly conservitave elements of the British right wing, but not for the politically super sensetive as the primary character MP Allan Bastard it thouroughly (and delibaratly) offensive.  That having been said, he is so outragous it is enormously ammusing.",918259200,,283,5.288888888888889
8183873,5,B000O78614,"Note: This ""complete series,"" also includes the 1-hour special ""Who Shot Alan B'Stard?,"" which I was unable to find elsewhere!

As for the show itself:
Rik Mayall is perfect as the ultra-cynical, mega-slimey Alan ""Enormous Majority"" B'Stard--the most conservative member of parliament.  The ingenious writing is a perfect match for Rick's uproarious, emotive acting. Screamingly funny. Insanely disturbing.  The series, as a whole, is simply: Not to be missed!",1474156800,,460,5.63768115942029
8183874,5,B000O78614,A great series with gifted comedian. While some knowledge of late twentieth century British politics is helpful the superb writing has stood the test of time. No one does political satire like the British.,1468713600,,205,5.0588235294117645

8183880,5,B000O78614,"This show is well written and the characters are relative to even today's politicians.  Rik Mayall is fantastic and the guests on the show add to the enjoyment.

This set is just the show.  No extras.",1410307200,,200,4.5
8183881,5,B000O78614,"Rik Mayall is hilarious in this show. Set in the 80's (the Thatcher years), Mayall plays a young Tory who is ridiculously ambitious and ruthless. Very British comedy that's a bit reminiscent of Blackadder, but with the silliness of a Fawlty Towers.",1409875200,,248,4.928571428571429
