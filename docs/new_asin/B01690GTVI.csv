8735886,3,B01690GTVI,"This is a collection of images about North Korea, intermixed are interviews of the film maker's father's thoughts about the North coming into existence and how/why he did not go there. Occasional insight, a tearful scene close to the end. Surreal.

Extras features two short films. The first appears to be footage from the air, the second is about Koreans who fought in the Viet Nam War, surprise!",1517875200,,397,4.838235294117647
8735887,5,B01690GTVI,"If you don't need your documentaries spoon-fed, this is an excellent film about North Korea, made up of segments of rare DPRK-produced feature films and news footage, as well as video filmed in the north by the director, Soon-Mi Yoo, currently the Chair of the Film and Video Department at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. Highly recommended.",1504396800,,354,5.016949152542373
