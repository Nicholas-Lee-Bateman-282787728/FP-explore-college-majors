8216505,3,6302413796,"I have known about this movie for at least a decade or more ever since I listened to (and loved) the instrumental title theme by Candy Dulfer and David A. Stewart (he of the Eurythmics) when it appeared on the famous Pure Moods compilation CD. From time to time I occasionally play the theme song, which in turn always makes me curious about the film. The song, if you're not familiar with it, is awesome. Would the movie be awesome too? All it took was another recent spin of the Lily Was Here Theme and some extra pocket change to make me order a copy from Amazon and see for myself. The copy I received is a 1992 VHS with a cover identical to the one shown above. The movie was originally released in 1989.

Right away, comparisons start on the back of the box itself, with the synopsis calling Lily Was Here a ""sexy thriller in the tradition of La Femme Nikita"". Seeing that I love La Femme Nikita, I was really excited. Unfortunately this film is not what I thought ""in the tradition of La Femme Nikita"" would be. There are some similarities - European-made, atmospheric music, alienated female protagonist caught in ethical dilemmas, but they end there. Lily Was Here also came before Nikita, so while Nikita may have benefited from Lily's release and exposure, I can now say after watching Lily Was Here that it is not a lost blueprint for Nikita or anything of the sort.

The film is shot in an unnamed city so the location provides zero character. In fact, the movie seemed a bit American more than anything else. The dialogue on this VHS has unfortunately been dubbed, to my great disappointment, muddling the performances. The opening credits feature an alternate take or remixed version of the famous theme, but the rest of the film is lacking strong background music, peculiar since a whole album of it was released and the music is the most famous part of the film and, looking back, its only high point. The whole thing is really like a slightly higher than average budget Lifetime movie in plot, tone, and feel. The concerns are serious (race, pregnancy, poverty, crime) but there is no originality or freshness in tackling them.

In conclusion, I'll say I was mildly disappointed. It's not a bad film, but it is slightly dull, and the connections to Nikita are far-fetched, as Nikita is a different and superior film. This is nowhere as stylish and gripping. So, you may be happy just continuing listening to the theme song and leaving the film up to your imagination. It'll probably be a lot more fun than the actual film itself.

After the film there is bonus footage of the music video featuring Candy Dulfer and David A. Stewart playing the theme song. I did enjoy that.",1357689600,,2691,4.6
8216506,3,6302413796,"I read about this from IDMb, as a lover of Dutch movies I brought this from Amazon. It was a good deal, and the video is in good condtion. Lilly gets knocked up, her boyfriend gets killed by skinheads. As soon as Lilly's mom finds out she knocked up by a black man. Lilly is kicked out on the streets. Lilly gets invouled with pimps. Poor Lily.  Its a slow start. I like it very much and will keep it, and watch it again and again. Lilly is underage runaway and soon robs banks. Its a good movie.",1330214400,2,496,4.061224489795919
