2383660,3,B000AABL4O,"This was a pretty good overview of the club, but of course only scratches the surfaces of the worlds most powerful outlaw biker gang.  More footage of the gang in action in Nevada would of been nice as they stood thier ground and went toe to toe with the Mongols.",1195344000,,263,4.26
2383661,2,B000AABL4O,"The best part of this DVD is Sonny Barger telling the clubs history from his point of view. Had the whole DVD been based on Sonny and his version of history and then it would have been worth it.

The rest of it is middle class reportage of a rehash of what Hunter Thompson wrote and Yves Lavigne re-reported in their books.

The vintage photos seem to have been lifted from said books.

The videos of Altamont, restaurant and street scenes were interesting though.",1185408000,4,464,4.5
2383662,3,B000AABL4O,"Informative, But overpriced and not in- depth and complete according to other accounts. If you want to know about the HA, I would suggest reading Sonny Barger's book ""Hells Angels"".",1174176000,3,181,5.066666666666666
2383663,4,B000AABL4O,"Great DVD, factual but would need to be updated a bit.

They really did do a good job in capturing the true American Hell's Angels story.",1169078400,2,137,4.269230769230769

8077034,5,B000AABL4O,"I hate to say I am a fan of the HA but some of us are attracted to ""bad boys"" for some reason. I hope when I grow up I won't be.",1358035200,,128,3.03125
8077035,3,B000AABL4O,Im a hardcore and a %er and this is factually based from a legal aspect and certainly doesnt shed a good light on the Red & White. It is very truthfull regarding the origins of the club but this is old and outdated and is not conducive to the club itself. I am glad that ive seen it just to know what informations in it but it needs to be updated and show equal perspectives from bith sides.,1325721600,,391,4.0256410256410255
8077036,3,B000AABL4O,"I'm becoming more and more disappointed with ""THC"" documentaries. Either I'm looking for documentaries to be more in-depth, or they becoming more and more shallow in thier coverage. This episode was probably more for people who have only ""just heard of"" the HAs. A previous reviewer was correct that most of the ""action"" video clips are really just clips from movies. Disappointing.

As a review of Amazon.com, the product arrived quickly and in good condition.",1323734400,,461,5.1466666666666665
8077037,5,B000AABL4O,I enjoyed learning about how the Hell's Angels got started with their club. I liked the interviews and how it explained from beginning to end how the club expanded. I was surprised on how the club grew and expanded into other parts of the world. I didn't know that about them. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in the history of the Hell's Angels.,1315440000,,363,4.515151515151516
8077038,2,B000AABL4O,"I am like most, rather watch a movie about a subject than read. However, I read ""Hell's Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club,"" by Sonny himself and found that there was a lot more information on the 81's that could/should have been in the episode especially since the history channel has almost 60 years worth of information regarding the ""Red and White!""

I was disappointed!!!",1313971200,,421,4.767123287671233
8077039,2,B000AABL4O,"How it all came to be and where it is now would have given a better insight into the club. The history of this club should have been the main idea for this DVD.... It was okay, could have been better.",1224460800,,200,3.902439024390244
8077040,3,B000AABL4O,"I saw this documentary on TV, and have two criticisms.
First, the growth and transformation of the Hells Angels from a local motorcycle club to a multi-national organization that spans at least five continents (North America, Europe, (South) Africa, South America and Australia) has an interesting history.
This growth was caused in large part by interest in the group overseas sparked by lwo budget films such as ""Wild Angels"" and the whole slew of drive-in quality ""biker flicks"" that lasted from the mid-60s to the mid-70s. (Members of the Hells Angels appeared, usually as extras, in several of these including ""Wild Angels,"" ""Hells Angels on Wheels,"" and ""Hells Angels '69.""
It was an odd merging of myth, movies and reality with an increase in one giving a boost to the other two aspects of the group.
Second, as someone who collects these (odd) films, I was astonished to see how much of the footage shown in this documentary came from various drive-in biker films.
Again we have the odd melding of myth, movie and reality merging in this documentary.
Much of the other footage, including interviews, came from the documentary ""Hells Angels Forever,"" a film that was produced by the Angels themselves as a public relations effort.
Therefore I felt this documentary gave about half the story and tried to exaggerate what it had in the way of information.
Still, it was interesting. I enjoyed it, but I think people who really enjoyed it might enjoy digging deeper as most of the footage came from sources that are already available to the public.",1209427200,10,1552,4.904942965779468
8077041,5,B000AABL4O,Great documentary. Great story of the Hell's Angels. Complete and good item for anybody like the story about this motorcycle club. A+A+A+A+A+.,1197417600,2,142,5.5
