976869,2,6305181179,"This film promises to be good but only when you see it at the video store.  First of all Bill Bellamy aint no playa!! The guy is ugly.  Secondly he hasn't got the playa characteristics, the role does not suit  him.  They need a real playa like me, but as I wasn't asked they shouldve  got Martin Lawrence. Wouldve been better if the the Playa was someone else.  But I gotta say the babes are sexy!",916790400,3,397,4.157894736842105

977173,4,6305181179,This is a light somewhat sexist comedy. There are some good laughs but not as hilarious to me as to some of the other reviewers. Some nudity but not particularly sensuous and does fit with the main character.,1434672000,,208,4.5

977343,5,6305181179,I mean first of all this movie has Bill Bellamy! That alone is enough. I grew up with a huge crush on him and his sense of humor was that much more attractive. This movie has adult humor and it will make you laugh if you grew up with the same generation as the 80's...,1391385600,,268,3.890909090909091
977344,4,6305181179,How to be a player is good movie because it is funny. I love black comedies and this is an oldie but goodie.

977452,5,6305181179,"Yes I saw this movie years ago, I just upgraded from VHS to DVD. It's good to have it just brings back memories if you were a fan of Bill's in the 90's.",1307232000,,152,3.6363636363636362
977453,3,6305181179,"I liked the movie ok, but to me I hope women don't let men used them in this way.  I gave this movie as a gift to a friend, they enjoyed it and like it, but of course it was a man...most men will enjoy this movie, I just think women need to charactertized as being settle than this, but to each his own.",1304899200,,303,3.734375

977506,4,6305181179,"""How To Be a Player"" Had me rolling  from beginning till the end..

Bernie Mac was Hilarious.. and the story was cute and thorough. Bill Bellamy and  Natalie Desselle ""his Nosey sister were good as well.

I'm gonna keep this review short. BUT BABY!!!  Please don't have any soda or food in your mouth when Bernie Mac

Walks in right after his wife was creepin with Belamy and says.."" Baby I smell somethin stank.. what is it ? and she proclaims she doesn't know what he is talking about.. so he say's it again. ""I SMELL SOMETHIN STANK"" by then I was already fallin out.

Then he says it smells like BO-D-USSY  in here .. You will find out what bodussy is and  ROTF...

It's always entertaining and good for some good laughs.",1173312000,6,724,4.37593984962406
977507,5,6305181179,Bill Bellamy is a player who has so many women so little time. His sister is just hatin on his game maybe because she's not much to look at. So at a party she invited all of his girlfriends at the same party where he's at just so he can get busted. her plain didn't work. How he got busted for the first time well watch this movie.,1140307200,3,331,3.8823529411764706

977509,1,6305181179,"This movie has got to be the least funny movie ever!
Hey even Master P's ""I GOT THE HOOK-UP"" was 10 times as funny.
The thing is there exist no plot, they have pretty much stolen the story from Martin Lawrence's ""A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE & HATE"" but then taken out the part that the female is a psycho so Nothing happens!
The only good part is the women but u can see that elsewhere u don't need to buy this to see that!
I rate it 0/5",1080604800,2,434,3.8876404494382024
977510,5,6305181179,"HELLO,
I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I USE TO WATCH IT A LOT, ON VIDEO.
I AM GLAD THEY PUT IT ON DVD!
THIS IS A VERY FUNNY MOVIE, TO ME, I LIKE HOW THE PLAYER GET'S PLAYED.
 PEEP THIS OUT!!!!!!!",1049155200,2,183,3.575
977511,2,6305181179,"If you want to see how the average young black man gets as much a** as he can in one day, get this film.  Bill Bellamy could not have went to Rutgers University to put out Bulls**t like this.  Bernie Mac is the only one in this film that's funny.  This should be popular with the BET crowd.",970099200,9,290,3.9655172413793105
7884379,5,6305181179,This is a twenty year-old classic. Amazon - get the right date on this film - 1997. It was fire upon its release.,1514073600,,113,3.9565217391304346
7884380,1,6305181179,"Inane, ridiculous, and plain stupid. Fail to understand 4 and 5 stars. Poor acting, sexist humor, needless profanity for lack of good dialogue. Trivialized infidelity, and mocked committment and marriage, portraying men as utter dogs interested in ways to better lie, cheat and manipulate their women. Portrayed women as innately needing to be ""played,"" because they're too ignorant, needy and incomplete without a man. This could have worked if the entire movie hadn't been one tediously long cliche, with stereotyping to the hilt. You know how you watch a movie that's so bad you think if you keep watching it somehow you'll find a moral or lesson or something to justify the time you just wasted? This is one of those. Pass- you'll beg to have the time back.",1511568000,,761,4.906976744186046
