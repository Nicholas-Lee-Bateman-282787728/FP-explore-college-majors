6259850,5,B00IDRQ49S,"The information presented in this dvd is easy to grasp, pleasant to view and useful in dispelling the harmful myth of catastrophic co2 contamination of the Atmosphere.  For those new to the debate, this dvd may cause some discomfort, but to those already informed, it will be a source of comfort, hope and strength which should invigorate us to live in responsible, industrious, earth and human enhancing freedom and through winsome discussion,  counter the myths and propaganda of the radical environmentalist agenda. In my opinion, this dvd is a must watch  by all concerned citizens and Christians, especially if you're in the ""green"" movement.",1394409600,27,647,5.201923076923077

BLUE not only exposes the fraud, junk-science and deceit in the Green Movement, but also offers HOPE and a fresh vision that is both pro-Humanity AND pro-Earth.

6259854,5,B00IDRQ49S,"Everyone should see this movie to learn what our Government is doing to us.  The movie was beautifully edited and written.  The content was
so revealing to me about Agenda 21 and what it is doing to our Country.  It sickens me to think that so many people in this Country do not know
what is happening to our World.  I know folks get busy with their lives and living, but what the Government is doing is ruining  our lives right
before our very eyes.  We need to wake up and become activists and fight for our right to live in a free Country.

6259855,5,B00IDRQ49S,Excellent Movie! This is a well rounded perspective of Agenda 21.  This film is great for newbies and for those who have been seeing the Agenda 21 policies being implemented in their our own cities/counties.

6259856,1,B00IDRQ49S,"The problems with this movie are epic. The first red flag is the people he talks to. Not a single PHD. or current expert on any relevant subject. Some of his most used sources include a coffee shop owner, a pilot and a resident. The credentials are just not there. The only scientist he has is a clearly retired geologist. He clearly picks people based on how much they agree with his agenda rather than their level of expertise. Seriously, none of the people who he interviewed had anything to offer other than an opinion/ their intuition. The second red flag is that the arguments are almost all economic and his sources are still not credible there. There was more talk on wealth and jobs than there was on how climate change can effect anything. He made the insane assertion that environmentalists want to destroy the economy and freedom. There were two arguments that actually involved the environment: plants like Co2 and there have been warming periods in the past where there was no industry. The first one willfully ignores that part of the problem has been deforestation and other destruction of plant life on this planet. This is made worse by the fact there is a hardcore argument for greater logging. He tried to make it seem like CO2 was the only factor in climate change. This oversimplification is dangerous and false. The second argument is as valid as saying that people died a thousand years ago when we didn't have guns so guns can't kill people. His attempts at emotional manipulation were fairly transparent as he chopped wood, fly-fished and wore plaid for no reason. He invoked god in a way to stir emotion and he brought out the boogyman of communism. This movie was not credible and not even that well made. It will not convince anyone who doesn't already agree.",1430265600,3,1788,4.697452229299363

Private doctors, spending their own money and donations on this film = Truth.  Gov't taking tax payers dollars to promote a false agenda to control the people = insanity!

Keep up the work Doctors, and parents - let's promote this video be shown in every HS and college across the nation wherever Mr. Gore's ""Inconvenient Lie"" movie is shown and let our kids and citizens decide for themselves.",1402272000,3,519,5.08235294117647

6259878,5,B00IDRQ49S,"JD King crammed a lot of information into the hour and half film.  The tennacles of UN Agenda 21 and the fierce consequences put on communities and individuals is astounding.  To think that our US government would allow this to happen in a so-called free country in incomprehensible, YET, here it is and it IS happening.  It's happening in my county, the county next to us, and the county in this film. It is happening globally but most people have no idea what is going on at their local level -  behind their backs.  It sounds like conspiracy until you see Nancy Pelosi in a video clip from CSPAN asking for the resolution to be passed by the US House of Representatives to adopt UN Agenda 21.  The practical application is to steal your private property, travel rights, water rights, using radical environmental regulations and laws. This is a MUST see and a MUST buy so your children will know what they are up against. I purchased this video at a conference that aired the film. I purchased five to have one for myself and to send to family and friends. I just wished the Q & A speakers were a part of it. A retired ecologist spoke and refute so much of the green-carbon spin you get from the radical environmentalists.  One scientist in the film was a greenie that turned 180 degrees after doing his own research. One VERY disturbing segment by a lady named Orlean showed book used in schools for propaganda against our children telling them ""God was surprised that another baby was born and that should not be happening."" Part of UN Agenda 21 is de-population. Status and figures and real citizens are interviewed in the film.  I highly recommend it.",1401408000,5,1657,4.574324324324325
6259879,5,B00IDRQ49S,"Finally an accurate portrayal consistent with the environmental experiences and regional histories of vested multi-generational lives intertwined with the land, communities, and environment they love, and upon which their sustainable futures depend.  We have lived and continue to see the fabricated false 'histories' and 'impacts' utilized to force regional attrition in pursuit of a profiting political Agenda.  This producer is one of the few with the courage to confront that Agenda and the environmental, economic,  and social disaster left in its wake as the result of the new 'top-down' decisions from a non-vested and benefitting unaccountable few.

6259880,5,B00IDRQ49S,"This fabulous, eye-opening film needs to be shown to every politician from Washington to California! Our legislative people need to know this truth and create laws that support the Constitution and our rights, and not believe all the lies and greed that the well-established green movement has succeeded with in bombarding the media. This refreshingly brilliant but humble young man needs to reach his generation especially. Be sure to see his other film, ""Crying Wolf"" that is equally fantastic.

6259883,5,B00IDRQ49S,Shockingly informative. It caused me to really evaluate my 32 year Sierra Club membership.  The need to balance humanity needs and our environment is becoming painful clear.

6259884,5,B00IDRQ49S,"This film can really enlighten those of us that are misguided by an ideology that is taking America down. I think that so many Americans, especially the young college kids, are so misinformed and believe anything that their liberal instructors tell them. It's nice to watch a film that lays out the truth about something instead of just saying that it's so.
I've been sharing it with everyone I know and nearly everyone is very impressed. Hold on to the Constitution fellow Americans and never let any politician take away a single one of YOUR Bill of Rights. If you support them in taking away even one (that you may think is wrong), then you've opened the door for them taking away a Right that you want to keep.

He digs deep and does the research so many are either unwilling to do or have no idea that there is an opposing view and facts to back it up!

Thank you for making this movie, I'm sure the Greenies have been put out by someone with actual facts debunking their ludicrous claims.  I'm Pro-Human race!  Go Blue!!!",1399420800,3,454,4.357142857142857

The green movement is a plague that has infiltrated the minds and hearts of today's generations through the lies and manipulation of power hungry extremists.

I applaud his work and hope anyone who reads this review believes me when I say, ""this is worth your time!"".

There is something dark and anti-human at the heart of environmentalism as it has been preached the past 10 or so years.  It is collectivist, prone to seek government solutions when market solutions are available.
