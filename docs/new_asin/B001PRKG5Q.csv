8334464,1,B001PRKG5Q,"This is a 5 star movie but this particular edition does not have subtitle option even though it is a Region 1 DVD.  The DVD I got is the film version, not the recording of the staged version. (?)",1380844800,,195,4.0
8334465,4,B001PRKG5Q,"These reviews have been assigned to the wrong product.  The photo and product information refer to the Arena di Verona production starring Marina Domashenko, but the reviews refer to John Eliot Gardiner's production using period instruments!  My rating applies to the Verona production.",1342569600,3,286,5.627906976744186
8334466,4,B001PRKG5Q,"This is a truly fine movie, and it's a crying shame that it isn't available with English subtitles at a reasonable price at present. So it's this or nothing. I chose this and I'm happy. It is, after all, a dance film, so the lack of subtitles doesn't affect appreciation of the many fine dance numbers in the film. And the story is obvious even if you don't speak Spanish: contemporary Spanish Flamenco troupe putting on a re-imagining of Bizet's opera ""Carmen"" as a Flamenco production, in which the troupe leader's relationship with his Carmen intervweaves with that of the fictional soldier with the fictional Carmen. By the end it's hard to tell which is production and which is ""reality,"" with or without subtitles--an ambiguity my wife was uncomfortable with, but which I found appropriate to the story, actually.

I'm sure you can get detailed synopses of this film if you want more details. Anyone who appreciates ""art Flamenco"" should have this film in their collection. It's well worth the price even if you only watch the dance sequences. Laura del Sol isn't just a great Flamenco Carmen--she absolutely owns the role. I couldn't imagine a better realization of the character's fire, sensuality, and wilfulness. Antonio Gades provides an elegant, tortured lover, and the Flamenco guitar work of Paco de Lucia...well, he's known as one of world's preeminent Flamenco guitarists--getting to see him perform is pretty thrilling, and the singers and other performers complement these stars nicely.

The very first scene shows Antonio Gades' dance troupe leader looking for the dancer to play his Carmen. You can take it from there--honest.

With every 10th rate Hollywood movie being out on DVD, it still astounds me that classics like ""Carmen"" get such short shrift. On the other hand the glass is half full--this version is available, and will run on American-coded DVD players (I think it was produced for the Argentine market).

A great companion piece for this film is director Carlos Saura's other Flamenco film ""El amor brujo,"" based on Manuel de Falla's eponymous ballet score. Just incredible.

I'll add a short bit in Spanish here, without the accent marks you'd get on a Latin keyboard:

Si le gusta mirar/oir bailando Flamenco, necesita ""Carmen"" en su coleccion. Necesita que comprar ese disco hoy. El director Carlos Saura es un maestro de peliculas sobre baile. Especialmente ""El amor brujo"" es magnifico tambien. Si mira ""Carmen,"" ningun va a olvidar Laura del Sol. Alma de fuego...",1340582400,6,2504,5.036231884057971
8334467,3,B001PRKG5Q,"I purchased this film, as I thought it was the version I saw in a small theater several years ago; sort of an art film theater. It was the opera Carmen told through flamenco dancing and it was wonderful. It combined a real life drama during rehearsals of flamenco version, which closely follows the story of Carmen itself. However, this DVD was not the same film and I was very disappointed. It was the theatrical production of the flamenco version of Carmen only, with no backstory.  The dancing and singing is very good, but, since I was expecting something entirely different, I was sadly disappointed. Also, the DVD says it has subtitles, but, when you click on them, they don't appear on the screen. Therefore, you don't know what the singers are singing. It hurts the film, since the songs tell the story. I don't know how to truly rate this film, because of my expectations. I would much rather have had the film I thought I was buying. I liked this film, but didn't love it like the one I really wanted. Had I to do it over, I would not have purchased it.",1331856000,29,1063,4.4512820512820515
