7918234,5,B00003CY8M,"My partner and I produced this giant screen film and released it in about fifty IMAX and giant screen theaters worldwide.  It is even better than a front row seat at one of their concerts.  Unfortunately, we don't have the rights to release this film anymore, but hope one day to be able to release it in 4K, HD and Bluray because it is an absolutely amazing piece of history with the very best performances of one of the top selling groups of all time.",1455408000,,453,4.317647058823529
7918235,4,B00003CY8M,"*NSYNC made 2000 their year, in music at least. They released the highly anticipated ""No Strings Attached,"" after a grueling lawsuit with RCA Records.
The fortunate quick resolve allowed the group to put the heavy promotion in drive. *NSYNC delivered in early January, beginning to share their first single, ""Bye, Bye,Bye.""
March 21st, 2000 was an unforgettable day in music history,as *NSYNC rised from teen magazine cutouts ,and poster spreads to super star artists. They dominated the Billboard Charts for weeks to come, and have remained #1 in first week sales.
With a top album *NSYNC was ready for a sold out tour,with a 3 night performance at Madison Square Garden. A live showing of the concert aired exclusively on HBO.
IMAX is in a similar setting as the DVD HBO Program, but seen on a huge screen.
Those that were able to attend got some free *NSYNC Merchandise. Sadly, few fans knew about this great show. The places that had it were few and far between.",1214092800,,966,4.790419161676646
