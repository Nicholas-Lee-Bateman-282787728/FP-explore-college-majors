8250427,5,B0013EFEYY,"""Also Ran"" is hilarious and very informative about the crazy recall process in the state of California (the process that resulted in the election of our current ""Governator"").  It's very entertaining.  Don't miss it.",1211500800,,216,5.323529411764706
8250428,5,B0013EFEYY,"This film shows the absurdity, and hilarity of the recall process in California.  How a body builder/actor could become governor with the unwitting help of a whining, immature, wealthy politician is fascinating.  The animation, and use of children gives it added appeal.  ""Also Ran"" is a total delight and a worthy winner of the Best Political Documentary award at the 2006 Atlanta Docufest.  I give it five stars.",1202515200,,414,5.044117647058823
