5242119,5,B0091JJ24Q,I saw this at a film festival a year ago or so and was totally mesmerized within the first 5 minutes of interviews.  This documentary goes to the heart of why we would see the Replacements live at every chance you got. Every show was going to be different and you never knew if they would make it to another one.,1348012800,7,312,4.114754098360656
5242120,5,B0091JJ24Q,"What makes Color Me Obsessed such an important film is that it is not only about the best band that too few people ever heard of, it's about the few people who heard and have forever loved them - their fans. The interviews with people close to the band and those whose lives the band touched are sometimes funny, sometimes riveting, and always great. This film made me realize how much the Mats meant to me since I first heard them in 1985. It helped me see how complex they were, how talented, how determined they were to make great music at the cost of any semblance of fame, and that in the end, they were not ""Unsatisfied."" As the film barnstormed the states and the world, there were several Mats cover shows played - I was fortunate to catch one in NYC at the Bowery Electric with my great pal Jennie. We've been Mats freaks for a long, long time - and it's likely neither of us knows more than one other serious fan. That's what makes the Mats great - there are no casual fans. You either love them or you think they are a movie starring Keanu Reeves. There are not many movies that teach you something about yourself, your childhood, your angst, your view of things - this one does. Highly recommended to any Mats fan, any fan of music you don't find on the radio or manufactured in a executive suite or manipulated through computer software. The Mats were quite possibly the last real deal in music. This film is every bit their measure. GO. SEE. IT. NOW.",1348012800,3,1464,4.366300366300366
5242121,5,B0091JJ24Q,"(Note: This review is from last year and is based on the movie itself. It does not include any of the bonus features on this 2 DVD set. But the movie is so good, I'm buying this set, even though I already own it.)

So, there's this documentary about the Replacements. It doesn't include any footage from the band. The band doesn't give interviews for it. They don't even use any of the music. It was funded via Kickstarter, a funding service I have come to love. We chucked in a small amount of cash, frankly just enough to ensure getting a DVD and T-shirt.

The DVD arrived last week but I didn't get a chance to watch it until last night. Here's my review:

The Good

Let me start at what I feared would happen to this movie. I remember hearing about it long ago, when it was supposed to be a documentary told by fans. As it developed, the advertisements started mentioning big names. Some were big names in the context of the MPLS scene, say Chris Osgood. Others were big names in the context of the larger entertainment industry. Here think George Wendt, Dave Foley, and Tom Arnold.

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm a big fan of Dave Foley. And I go absolutely [fruit]-cakes over old NewsRadio episodes. But, frankly, I really don't give a [gosh darn] about his views on the Replacements. Why would I? What insight can he bring?

And it made me worried that the film would become infested with interviews with people included for their fame rather than their insight. I was prepared to be happy if the film kept the celebrities to less than a third of the screen time.

Turns out I shouldn't have been worried.

Wendt's one short clip is awkward and, well, stupid. Foley's are cute enough. And Tom Arnold does actually have a good story to tell. In all, very little screen time is used on celebrities.

I was also worried about the local celebrities, often fellow artists. In general, I think musicians make for the worst music commentary. They're just too close to it. These local scene celebrities are combined with fans in a good ratio to fill in the rest of the screen time. And how do they do?

In a word, [Gosh Darn] Awesome! (Okay, [three] words.)

No, really, it's sooooooooo good. The stories are good. The commentary is good. Hardly anyone in the movie says monumentally stupid things. About 2/3rds of the way through, my wife stopped by to ask how it was. My voice was actually trembling as I told her how perfect it was.

What really struck me was the balance. The guy who made it, Gorman Bechard, doesn't have an ulterior motive here to tell a particular narrative. Instead, everything is in wonderful balance. The guy who talks about Replacements fans finding too much delight in the continual [mess]-ups of the band is balanced against fans decrying the lack of [mess]upedness in later records. Tim is called a sell-out record as well as a sign of growth. Pleased to Meet Me is decried for not including Bob as well as described as a masterpiece, partially because it was unshackled from Bob. And all these points of view are valid. Such is the contradictory nature of the band. It's just, well, it's just [gosh darn] perfect.

Well, nearly perfect.

The Bad

Actually, there's nothing bad. There's the utterly unnecessary and uncomfortable clip of George Wendt. And there's the couple of unneeded, but at least marginally chuckle-worthy, clips of Dave Foley. Arguably, there's too much from the Goo Goo Dolls and the Gaslight Anthem.

And then there's a bearded writer who is allowed to ramble on for far too long. He alone makes the last third of the movie pale, just a touch, in comparison to the prior footage. But, honestly, isn't that how a Replacements documentary should be? Kinda brilliant. Kinda dumb. Kinda the Replacements.",1348012800,3,3751,4.626506024096385

Huge fan of this band and some ""cute"" stories that's the only word I could come up with after the torture of watching this double dvd, but would have loved to have the bands perspective and how about some of their music or actual footage of them performing. Do they still the word ""cool"" because this Roc-Doc it was not. What a waste of money.

5242141,3,B0091JJ24Q,"I made it to the end of the film and found it interesting from a completist's standpoint.  But I did have to watch it over a couple sittings, because endless interviews with aging gen-x-ers get a little tiresome, no matter how passionate they are.  As an aging gen-x-er myself, I could have hung out with my friends and actually listened to the music.
This probably sounds more harsh than the film deserves because it clearly is a labor of love and is impressive in its comprehensiveness.",1469923200,,488,4.662790697674419

Having picked up Sorry Ma in 1981 and followed the progression through Tim - which is where I gave up - I saw the Mats live numerous times throughout Minneapolis and while I laughed a couple of times while they talked about Bob Stinson's wardrobe choices the rest was just blah blah blah.

5242155,5,B0091JJ24Q,"A few years have passed since I last watched this. I rented it yesterday. Nothing's changed. If you're looking to go down memory lane with pictures, videos or backround  Replacement music, then watch this and DO just that. Pull up some pictures, and videos, from any Replacement-loving site and depending on how old you are, listen to your own records, mixed tapes or CD's. This is through and through a running oral public record of people who have had the opportunity to bring the greatest band that could of been into their lives. The only negative comment I have has nothing to do with Mr. Bechard's film. It has to do with the common thread shared by alot of people who've reviewed not just Color Me Obsessed, but the Replacements music up until Tim's release. When Bob Stinson's name appeared on the screen, I pretty much tuned myself out. I still continued to watch, and listen, but it was difficult. Bob Stinson was a brilliantly amazing guitarist. He was amazing to watch. If you don't think so, there are many Static Taxi recordings out there to hear how great he was.",1455321600,2,1078,4.643979057591623

From the owners of Twin Tone records to the Huskers, with every journalist, peripheral character, and Punk worth hearing from.

We were blessed with The Mats, Suburbs, Soul Asylum, Run Westy Run, Husker...They all had their thing & on any given night you could see great live music. The Mats were absolutely unpredictable, sometimes you couldn't look away no matter how ""off"" they were. It's great to see how we were not alone in thinking this band is special & had that rare ability to transcend so many lives. I only wish there could have been interaction from the members in this story. I suppose the less said, the greater the legend?",1454544000,4,657,4.39344262295082
5242158,4,B0091JJ24Q,Only 4 stars because there were no interviews at least with some of the remaining living members.  Otherwise this was an enjoyable doc on the Mats.,1453852800,,147,4.653846153846154

Boy was I wrong! Everyone interviewed in this love letter to Minneapolis's finest is as fanatically and devotedly attached to the history and memories of the Mats past as they are to their own. Gorman Bechard has the documentarian's knack of knowing exactly what to bring out in his subjects and what to leave out of the film as he so expertly did in his Grant Hart doc. Every Everything.  It's fantastic to see old faces like Jim DeRogatis , Robert Christgau, and references to the greatly lamented Creem magazine, which like one of the interviewees in the film, I myself first read about this band who wore green shoes, orange slacks, and drank like champions in 1987.

To hear personal stories about what the Mats have meant to others provides an ideal prism for one's own reflection. Great music is personal and universal at the same time. We love the Replacements because of how they make us feel, but also because we know we are part of a larger community - one we find left of the dial.

OK, let's bring this to a real terms. You also get a lot of great ""insider"" perspective from people who were part of the Mats scene. That's cool.

As a long time fan it is nice to hear other perspectives and stories from the normal stuff that have been written to death in articles and books over the years. My main complaint with the film is that there were a few people that got WAYYYYY to much camera time who didn't really deserve it and didn't really add anything in the second, third, fourth, etc. clip of them than they did in the first. While other rather stunningly deserving people got very little time. Bob's ex wife for example who I am sure had lots of very interesting unknown insight to Bob or Dan Zanes from the Del Fuegos who used to hang out with the band when they were in Boston are two perfect examples. I think Dan might have almost hit 8 seconds of screen time. But the most glaring lack of time was David Minehan. He got a few clips in there (and by that I mean no more than two, maybe three), but jebus H., this guy has played a lot with Paul on his solo stuff and is now a regular member of the band, yet we get to hear endless dribble from some fiction writer farm hick.

One amazing thing about the 'Mats is that they could be your brothers, your friends, even you.

5242193,5,B0091JJ24Q,"i was 15 in '89 when my mother, (who worked for the local rock station in Santa Rosa, CA), came to me with tix to some band called The Replacements, playing at the Luther Burbank Center in North SR, just south of Windsor, CA. having no idea who they were, she drove me to the show, dropped me off and about 30m later i was hit in the stomach and stunned to temporary mental unconsciousness with the most amazing music i'd ever heard, i was on fire from head to toe and weak at the knees from the brilliant force coming from the stage.

having grown up with all kinds of music/concerts at that point, this band brought me to my knees, i was pressed against the stage and all i could do was bang my head and throw my arms around like an angry banshee screaming lyrics i hadn't a clue about, mostly just screaming and smiling so hard my face hurt. it was like i'd found the gods to whom i would bow to and pay homage to for the rest of my life.

after the show, my mother picked me up...i was covered in sweat, vodka, (as paul had poured and entire red cup full of vodka over me and a few others around me), and was yelling, as couldn't hear for the ringing from being 20ft from the stage amps...(the ringing lasted about 3d, and annoying tho it was, i smiled every time i thought about the cause of the ringing :) )

i was never the same again.

immediately i bought Please To Meet Me and Don't Tell A Soul, i know those two albums so well i could sing them both in my sleep...they both spoke to me so much, it was like they were singing my life, and knew what to say to help me feel better.

from there i found my love for all things punk/alt & rock/lyrics/melodies in its rawest/purest form. i'm still not a fan of arena shows, and prefer to see a band on a small, bare (save for the players and their instruments) stage playing music for the love of the sound/experience...i owe it all to the replacements.

i know i missed the early days of the band...but i am more than grateful to have had that experience. without which i wouldn't have found my passion for new/interesting music. tho my parents were seminal in my music background, The Replacements inspired a passion in me for music that remains as strong today as it was the first moment i heard them back in '89.

this doc is great and the best part is you get to hear the fans voices...and hear from them what you felt/feel about the band...and the background interviews from the people they knew, or who worked with them, seems to give a more intimate look than it probably would have been with the band themselves. GREAT doc, if you're a music lover or simply a Replacements fan...either way you'll most likely enjoy it. just don't plan on seeing the band themselves...but the people who do talk...well, you see how they were all similarly affected...love it!",1403654400,,2820,4.299435028248587

No-one from the group themselves is interviewed, nor are any clips, songs, or even photos used.

What could have been an experimental-seeming gimmick actually really draws the viewer in as the interview subjects recount the bands rise to prominence, their anarchic live shows, and the musical envelope-pushing of their early records and subsequent commercial sound of their later ones.

The roster of talking heads includes a handful of celebrity admirers like The Kids in the Halls Dave Foley, George Wendt and Tom Arnold, contemporaries like Husker Dus Grant Hart, younger musicians who were influenced by the group like members of the Hold Steady, the Gaslight Anthem, and the Goo Goo Dolls, and a multitude of greying record engineers, punk club promoters, record store owners, college station DJs, and others.

Am I interested in hearing Grant Hart, Greg Norton, Jack Rabid and Tommy Ramone tell stories about the Replacements? Of course I am. Am I interested in hearing stories from the woman who inspired ""Answering Machine?"" Absolutely. Do you care if it really is Dave Pirner screaming at the Minneapolis police at the beginning of ""Kids Don't Follow?"" I do. I don't know why, but I do.

Would you really expect Paul, Tommy and Chris to sit through interviews to facilitate a documentary? I don't see that happening. Not their style.

These are stories about the greatest band in rock and roll history and I could listen to them over and over again. I am as fascinated by the band today as I was almost 30 years ago and I enjoyed hearing other peoples' perspectives.

I guess there's a place for a interviews with musicians talking about themselves, but I don't think anything is lost by the telling of this story in this way, but it adds to it because of the fans relationship to the music and what it meant to them.

Some say that Nevermind was named after the song of the same name on Pleased To Meet Me.
""Everything we do is based on The Replacements."" - Jeff Tweedy onstage in 1997 prior to Wilco covering Color Me Impressed

5242219,4,B0091JJ24Q,"What makes this film worth seeing is the way it peels back the layers of the band's cult following (which it is, to be frank no matter the raves of the critics) and the way people's view change after each album.

If you are a fan of the band, you know that Let It Be is the line of demarcation-that line that a certain segment feels separates the ""posers"" from the ""true"" fans.  It's at this point in the film you see and hear what I dislike most about indie rock fandom: the absurd sense propriety people have about the band up to Let It Be; the fetishizing of Bob Stinson's addictions and behavior; the adolescent mindset that sloppy playing, unprofessional behavior, and wasted potential is ""authentic"" or punk.  In a way, the nut of the film is Let It Be vs Please To Meet Me-which I think is a good shorthand to describe the film that fans of the band will get right away.

What's interesting about this take is the number of people in the film who rate Please To Meet Me as their best work (count me as one of them).  This begs the second  big question the film takes on: how do we reconcile the demise of the band with the great songs of Paul Westerberg?  The segment on Tim captures this well as almost everyone agrees that record sound bad, yet the songs by themselves are brilliant. Westerbeg songs or Replacement music?  That's an other big one to chew on.

Other reviews have hit some of the other major points. All in all this film is inside baseball for fans of the band. And if that is you, this is a must see.",1368316800,3,1525,4.267361111111111

After watching for 20 minutes I called my friend who also loves the Mats and appreciates how they impacted us personally and the world.  We agreed that after my viewing I would let him borrow.  After 20 more minutes of viewing, I texted him explaining that ""The Replacements - Color Me Obsessed"" was too good to let him borrow and that I would purchase him his own copy from Amazon which I did.

""The Replacements - Color Me Obsessed: A Film About The Replacements"" put into perspective and reminded me of what music meant to me back in the early 80's.  In particular, The Replacements.  Growing up in metro Detroit, I spent a great deal of time trying to dig up new music that was not widely available.  When that new music was discovered, the live show was next.  A friend let me borrow his vinyl copy of ""Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash"".  The first playing of that record has since changed the way I listen to music.  At that time, I thought The Replacements were American ""Punk"".  I now realize that The Replacements were not American ""Punk"" but American Rock and Roll.

This DVD puts into words what I've been trying to say about The Replacements for years.  It is very refreshing and fascinating to hear the testimony from their fans explaining how they impacted their lives.  Mine too.

The Mats were never a huge band, and yet they have a strong following and influenced so many other artists and fans.  The footage of other fans is really a neat way to know that there is a community out there who was as influenced by the music as I was and am.

The Mats have always been an unusual band, even in their prime--maybe *especially* in their prime--& any documentary would have to present them in all that unique glory somehow.  I'm very pleased to say that ""Colour Me Obsessed"" not only met, but exceeded my expectations.
  One complaint that I've read here & there is that none of The Replacements music was included in the film.  To me, that was perfect.  Because, speaking as a fan since 1983, discovering their songs for the first time was a totally magical experience.  For anyone viewing this film without the pleasure of being a fan of their incredible catalouge of classic songs already, this film will not only make them curious to have that experience, but then those uninitiated will be able to do just that in the way any music fan should, via the albums.  Then they too will be able add their own story of discovery and their own thoughts & feelings about this amazing band to those of the fans interviewed & included in this film.  I honestly believe that's as it should be.  We Mats fans have always been a bit of a unique club and fellow fans I've encountered over the years are always happy to discuss their own stories--of songs, of shows, of favourite moments.  I know I for one would love hearing what any new fans of the band who saw the film first, then had that rare chance to listen later would have to say.
  The interviews are great, as are all the stories told within them.  I love the mix of fans, fellow musicians, and family that participated.  Everyone was entertaining and added something special to the film.  This is a fascinating documentary and the extras included are superb. Highly recommended for the fan and uninitiated alike.",1358812800,3,1845,4.648148148148148
5242233,4,B0091JJ24Q,"As someone who has met, and seen the Mats a number of times, I was eagerly waiting for this documentary. I was a bit disappointed that the documentary did not feature any of the music or interviews with the surviving members of the band, and I'm not sure if you understand the Mats and who they were, why you would care what 'industry' people had to say about the band. Hearing from members of a fellow band in the same vein such as Husker Du was more in line with what the Replacements were actually about.

I met Bob Stinson at CBGBs during his last year with the band, Bob was hammered and we played pool. You could see that drinking and other issues were really getting to Bob, he wasn't well. And the documentary does speak on the fact that the Replacements were a band that had seriously unfulfilled potential. They really could have gone somewhere, if they weren't so self destructive.

As a fan, and someone who worked that same circuit of clubs they did in their early days I felt (at the time) that they were our secret, and if you didn't like them you didn't know what you were missing.
They could be amazing or tragic, depending on the show that you saw them play, and the intake of alcohol that Paul, Bob, Chis and Tommy had that evening. The documentary touches on both of these issues, and leaves one with the same bittersweet feeling that the band left a real fan with, the could have beens, the might have beens. Just the sad fact that this band should have gone so much farther than they did.

For a documentary that doesn't use any of the music, or interview any of the members this is a good, solid work. If you are a fan and own the music of the band, you should get this. Or get this if you like music and it will get you into a great band that faded before their time.",1358812800,3,1791,4.261764705882353

5242235,1,B0091JJ24Q,"Gorman - I've seen how much you have/are defending this movie and as a Replacements fan, I guess I understand a bit why you made it...but I feel that maybe you aren't completely understanding why people are disappointed. I agree that too many reviews focus on the lack of music, but I don't think that you should focus too much on that being the only flaw that viewers are finding here.

I knew about the movie and the whole fan-funding, grass-roots movement to get it made before I saw it. I knew it didn't feature any music or interviews with the band members before I saw it. I heard early bad reviews before I saw it. I eventually broke down and saw it in Austin, TX when you presented it at The Alamo. The group of about 10 friends that I ended up with universally felt it was a waste of time. Even going in with really low expectations, we were disappointed.

Personally, my biggest problem is how pretentious most everyone comes off. It's like a bunch of fans trying to out-hipster each other. After reading Jim Walsh's excellent ""All Over But The Shouting,"" I was thinking you might actually be able to capture some of that magic in a documentary...and that is where the movie fails for me. Maybe growing up in the Midwest (Wisconsin), seeing a ton of Replacements shows (from Stink through the final shows at Summerfest & Grant Park)...and hearing much more interesting vignettes from almost any friend or drunk at the corner bar makes the stories in your film seem trite.

Unfortunately, I don't really have much in the way of remedy or constructive criticism  to offer - It's too late anyway. Maybe less industry/wannabe camera time. Maybe a few more ""Joe Average"" stories. Maybe more of a ""friends telling each other stories"" vibe. Maybe some interviews with lesser-known bands talking about how The Replacements influenced them would have helped - I'm sure some of those bands would donate some original music or throw in a live clip to break up the monotony without losing the point of the movie. Maybe when the GBV version is made, you can atone for the missteps in this one.

I'm on my way to The Alamo to see The Archers ""What Did You Expect?"" movie tonight. I'm really hoping you got that one right and with the cooperation of the band, I have no doubt that you did.",1358121600,28,2284,4.560975609756097

What you see instead is interviews with people whose lives were affected by the Replacements--people who worked with them, knew them, listened to them and loved them in all their rock and roll glory.

It's the perfect way to tell the story of a band that is difficult to explain. Like most art, the Replacements have to be experienced to be understood and the film makers have wisely chosen to let the witnesses testify.

On another level, it also gives a glimpse into the alternative music scene of the 1980s--a time when the landscape was filled with great bands that did not sell a lot of records but were a huge influence on the following generations of artists--and into another side of the Minneapolis music scene, one that was often overshadowed by Prince and his progeny.

Basically a bunch of scenesters and occasional fellow musicians going on and on (and on) about the band. Not one interview with any of the members; not one bit of old live footage. Nothing. Just these people yammering on about the 'Mats how they are a cornerstone of punk rock and how amazingly great they were etc etc (one weenie gushed about having a boy-crush on Tommy Stinson).

I'm a 50 year old that thinks 'Bastards Of Young' is one of the best songs about growing up I've ever heard, who's heart is torn apart when listening to 'Unsatisfied' and is still trying to learn to play 'Answering Machine' on the guitar. This last month or two I've been sending Facebook messages to all my buddies who I know will love this movie, they all still have a fire in their hearts and are still as enthusiastic about music as they were in their early adulthood. Those of us across the pond who loved this band can now feel a little closer to them. I know there were a number of bands in the UK around the late 80's who really loved The Replacements: Mega City Four, The Senseless Things, Midway Still and my band The Seers. There were countless others. My band got to tour with The Ramones, Iggy Pop and The Red Hot Chili Peppers, so we were all part of the same world. This dvd is like a handshake across the water for me. I've never been to the US or seen The Replacements, but I did get the chance to see Hsker D, The Moving Targets, Bullet LaVolta, The Pixies and REM. Two bands I'd loved to've seen would definitely have been The Replacements and Uncle Tupelo. I'm really hoping that one day someone does a UT documentary.

And that's exactly why we were there to see it.

My eyes and ears were glued to the screen for the entire length of the film because, quite simply, the people on the screen knew things I didn't know. They saw things I never saw. They witnessed the band's triumphs, failures, fights, strengths and ultimately, their weaknesses. The folks featured here share all the things that explain what made this band such a critical part of Rock and Roll history, and it was especially touching observing how Rock and Roll's most beloved F-ups made them feel. In most cases, it's the same way The Replacements always made me feel. What Gorman's done here is absolutely brilliant. If you know the band well, all the soundtrack you need is right in your head.

It is curious that they went ahead and made a documentary highlighting each and every album The Replacements have ever released and there's not ONE SONG to be heard the whole time. I guess it was just too expensive to include them. But it feels half-finished. For me, a more complete documentary would include some footage (some still photos at least...besides that ONE cute publicity shot of the band at the end) and is it too much to ask for a few snippets of the dang MUSIC that changed my life?! Still, it was fun to see the interviews from regular everyday fans as well as some more famous musicians and actors all gushing about how much the music meant to them; they put into words, sometimes quite eloquently, the feelings that I never had been able to really express about my favorite band in the world. So, on that level it was meaningful to watch. It's also good for some interesting back story behind the songs and the infamous performances (for those of us who didn't have the privilege to grow up around Minneapolis in the early 80's).

Watching this film is a lot like sitting at a bar while someone who knew a famous guy tells you all about him. Technically it's great, it's assembled with care and well-edited. Grant Hart's interviews in particular are a real treat.

But an hour and a half of that? I don't care who the chatty guy at the bar was, I'd have told him to shut up or just walked away mid-wistful recollection long before that.

I can't help but think that including some of the band's music would have been beneficial to the film. I knew going in that the director wasn't including music or photos but for whatever reason a few photos were included at the end of the film. Based on the direction of the film, I can understand why band interviews weren't included. Nevertheless it would have been cool to at least hear from the Westerberg and Stinson. Admittedly I was a little annoyed by the director's comments on disc 2 that those going in expecting to hear some of the band's music are ""f***ing morons"". In my opinion kind of comes off a little disparaging but I guess he felt strongly about how he wanted to shoot the documentary. Definitely worth watching, four stars I guess for the production and lack of music.",1354924800,2,1118,4.709183673469388
5242251,5,B0091JJ24Q,"This is a movie about a band that doesn't interview any surviving band members, doesn't play a single one of their songs, and has more photos of their fans in 1985 than of the band itself. Is this an avant garde art thesis? No, it is an oral history of one of America's best rock bands.

If you aren't already familiar with the Replacements, this isn't the equivalent of a VH1 Special that will explain it to you. Excerpts of interviews about the band's history and albums are organized chronologically, but if you don't know who Paul, Tommy, Bob, Chris, and Slim are, it is like walking into somebody else's Christmas dinner where everybody is talking about family members they have already known their whole lives. This is the first movie I've seen where the main characters are barely seen and only discussed. That leads to the question of who the film is really about: is it a visual social history about a rock band, or is it a movie about the people who loved a band over two decades ago and still do even more so today? Ultimately, it's both.

For Replacements fans, this movie is the definitive biography of the band from those who were there. It has firsthand answers from people like Young Fresh Fellows guitarist Scott McCaughey, who gives a backstage view of what actually happened during the infamous December 1987 Pine Theater concert that led to the inscription of ""We're sorry, Portland"" on the vinyl of Don't Tell a Soul. A touchingly bittersweet interview with Carleen Stinson tells what it was like first dating Bob. There are plausible explanations for the mysterious titles of Tim and ""Shooting Dirty Pool"". Matt Wallace has the chance to talk about what the band was attempting on the band's arguably most divisive record, Don't Tell a Soul. (I won't spoil the answers, you have to see it for yourself.) The movie breathlessly switches between the band's history to the personal stories of the fans, who twenty years after the band's last show casually talk about how the band affects them to this day. Elaine Pan's story of how finding the band as a teen meant finding someone who she could finally relate to is a moment any music fan knows.

Even though the documentary already runs 123 minutes, and to its credit, as a Replacements fan it made me walk away wanting even more:  I wanted to see some of the interviews in their entirety, such as Archers of Loaf bassist Matt Gentling and even professional curmudgeon Robert Christgau, whose contrary opinion is at least hilarious even when not agreeable (""You'd kick Bob Stinson out of your band too!"") There are people I wish the movie could have heard from, such as Bill Calahan, author of the original Willpower fanzine and later of Smog fame. Bill was an early fan of the band and quit publishing his magazine around the time Bob Stinson left, most likely reflecting the outcry from fans described in the movie. Another person it would have been great to hear from is Superchunk/Guided By Voices/Bob Mould drummer and comedian Jon Wurster, whose `Mats fandom knows no bounds. For any fan, this movie could never be comprehensive enough, and I could only hope someday Gorman Bechard could make the full interviews of people like Mac McCaughan available for download or in an extended edition.

In the end, there's a feeling that twenty years on, many of the people who were around when the Replacements were together are now retired from the rock business, yet their memories are as emphatic as if the band only broke up last month. The showing in Rijeka was attended mostly by members of Croatia's small rock underground, which sums up the band perfectly: even if they weren't the most popular band in the world, the few that heard them went on to start bands of their own that carry the torch for indie rock today. When some kid with a guitar in his bedroom 40 years from now wants to know what it was like to see the Replacements, this is how they'll hear the story firsthand.

Full disclosure: I appear for a moment in this documentary, and already loved this band for two decades and counting.

He calls you out right away knowing he's going to be judged on this very point. Apparently if you care about their music you don't ""get"" them and shouldn't call yourself a fan.

5242255,4,B0091JJ24Q,"Being that there are already many excellent reviews of ""Color Me Impressed"" I'm going to try to keep this short. First off, this IS an excellent documentary. However, in many ways it is simply an oral history on film. There is no live footage of the Replacements, no interviews with any of the band members, a bare handful of photos of the band and a few fliers, etc., and most importantly NO Replacements music. Now, for those of us who've loved the Replacements for years and are very familiar with their albums this isn't an issue. BUT, for someone looking for a documentary that serves as an introduction to the band or the casual viewer(granted most people who purchase this documentary will probably be familiar with the band's catalog)the in-depth discussions of particular albums, songs, etc., may seem a bit esoteric.

I found ""Color Me Impressed"" an excellent companion to Jim Walsh's awesome oral history of the 'Mats from 2007, ""The Replacements: All Over But The Shouting"". The interviews contained in ""Color Me Impressed"" are intelligent, emotionally revealing, dynamic, and perfectly convey the convoluted and often perplexing history of this truly brilliant band. I think one of the reasons for this unique nearly ""interviews only"" approach by filmaker Gorman Bechard is the simple fact that while there are SO many legendary stories(some true, some false, some falling somewhere in between), comparitively speaking, there is very little top-notch film footage of the Replacements(particularly from the '80-'85 period). So I can certainly understand the decision to not include grainly, sub-par footage of the band(although I'm sure there IS some killer footage hidden away that all of us 'Mats fanatics would die to see). But, I STRONGLY disagree with the filmaker's lack of inclusion of Replacements' music. Now maybe this was out of their control and the filmakers simply couldn't legally include any of the 'Mats music. However, I have a sneaking suspicion that it was an artistic choice. If the cause was legal entanglement, then cudos to the filmakers for making ""Color Me Impressed"" work as well as it does!

So what is ""Color Me Impressed""? It is a moving, always enjoyable collection of thoughtful, often hugely entertaining interviews with a variety of people ranging from the Twin/Tone Records inner-circle and Replacements road-crew, producers(ranging from the legendary Steve Fjelstad to Tommy Ramone to ""Don't Tell A Soul"" producer Matt Wallace), contemporary musicians(members of Husker Du, Suicide Commandos, Babes In Toyland, and Replacements influenced groups like Archers of Loaf, The Figgs, Decembrists, and many others), friends and lovers, actors(Tom Arnold, Norm Peterson from ""Cheers""), promoters, and most interestingly, fans(whose candid and often very personal revelations of the sheer impact that this band had on their lives is compelling and courageous). All of these figures weave a chronologically told story of the band and the effect the band had on their lives(in many instances from a professional standpoint), good or bad. The tales of Replacement debauchery and disfunction are told and debunked with equal glee and many of those interviewed speculate on the causes of the Replacements' inability to break through to the mainstream(often seeming to sabotage their own success) and also the reasons for their lasting and truly enormous influence(particularly in the years following the band's break-up).

In many ways the tale of The Replacements IS much like ""Rashomon""(as The Village Voice stated in their review of ""Color Me Impressed"") with each witness taking a slightly differing perspective on who and what The Replacements truly were and how they left their mark or failed to do so. This documentary is an exercise in Replacements scholarship and sociological study. For this reason it is enthralling for those of us who envision a much bleaker world had The Replacements not existed and wish to take an in-depth look at the way this great band effected those who encountered them(personally or through the grooves of their records and the photos on the album covers and jackets). However, due to the lack of music and footage it does NOT serve well as an introduction to the band for those not already familiar with the 'Mats.

5242259,4,B0091JJ24Q,"The Replacements were the type of band that postured behind the old cliche of every ambitious rock band that they were going to do it their way and not follow any rules.  But unlike many of those bands, they meant it, and they created a loyal following that this movie presents to us in celebration of the Mats.  Even though I think the inclusion of music would have helped to enlighten the unfamiliar watching this doc, it still works beautifully in letting the rest of us share in what it was like to have experienced them, and ""them"" is a band that made some mighty damn good rock and roll that ""shoulda woulda coulda"" been big hits in a smarter world.  They didn't get their proper due then.  Hopefully, this cool documentary gets it for them now.",1349827200,,751,4.45985401459854
5242260,5,B0091JJ24Q,"The Replacements are by far one of the most important bands of all time and I can think of no other band that deserves a music documentary to be made about them more (other than maybe Big Star, but they have one in the works as well.)
Whenever I'm asked why I like the Replacements, I always think back to a quote by filmmaker John Cassavetes about how as artists, you must risk everything and ""dare to fail"". This is exactly what the Replacements did every night of their career and a lot of times they did fail, and that in my eyes makes them one of the greatest bands in the world. And this film captures their reckless essence perfectly.
If you are a Mat's fan, buy this. If you are a music fan who has never heard the Mat's, this film will show you how deeply a band's music (to quote a Hold Steady line, which is fair since Craig Finn is in the film) can be scratched into someone's soul.",1349827200,2,894,4.173410404624278
5242261,5,B0091JJ24Q,"If you know anything about the Replacements, you'll be aware that their live shows could often degenerate into drunken sets of sloppy and abortive covers and that members of the original incarnation of the band---singer, guitarist, and songwriter Paul Westerberg; bassist Tommy Stinson; lead guitarist Bob Stinson; and drummer Chris Mars---would be so incapable of performing that they would hand over vocal duties or their instruments to roadies or audience members. It's in the spirit of such self-silencing that Gorman Bechard's 'Mats documentary, _Color Me Obsessed_, contains neither interviews with members of the band (who also included Slim Dunlap and Steve Foley) nor their music; instead, fans, friends, and colleagues of the band have their say, making for a refreshing departure from the standard compilation-style music doc.

That history-from-below form is matched by theme. While it's great to hear from music insiders such as Grant Hart, Steve Albini, Tommy Ramone, Dan Zanes, Mac McCaughan, Craig Finn, or Lori Barbero, the best interviews come from fans for whom, to paraphrase Michael Azerrad, this band became their life---or, indeed, their lifesaver. Perhaps the most affecting testimony comes from writer Robert Voedisch, who talks about how, as a teenager growing up on an isolated farm in the rural Midwest, the Replacements were a gateway (drug?) to culture and a sense of community.

Like Voedisch, other interviewees testify that the Replacements became their obsession. With six hours of extras, the _Color Me Obsessed_ DVD will inspire 'Mats fans to their own memories and reveries of hearing the band for the first time, having their lives changed by songs like ""I Will Dare,"" ""Unsatisfied,"" or ""Swingin' Party,"" seeing one of the band's drunken live shows, or seeing them play a set that confirmed them as the world's greatest rock-and-roll band. And for those learning about the Replacements for the first time, this film will inspire them to seek out those songs---which, though not present in the film, hover around like the ghost of Bob Stinson---and to become impressed with, depressed by, and obsessed with them.",1349827200,7,2149,5.317647058823529
5242262,5,B0091JJ24Q,"This film is an absolute must see for any Replacements fan. Neither the band members nor any of their music appears in this film.  Instead, the story of The Replacements is told entirely through those who knew them best - their friends, their fans and their contemporaries. Throughout the film, you get the history of the band from those who were there seeing them in the early days, and the stories about the band from those who were there to witness their antics.  It's a really well done film that's a blast to watch again and again.",1349827200,2,536,4.515463917525773
5242263,5,B0091JJ24Q,"Simple fact- The Replacements were one of the most important bands of the last thirty years.
  They failed to fulfill their massive potential, never having anything like a hit record. They had to be satisfied with completely changing the entire landscape of Rock music.

  Color Me Obsessed is a love letter, not to or from the band, but from a fan to, you know, the other fans. The Replacements have no input here, there's no music from the band, and except for a couple readily available promo pictures during the credits, are never on-screen for the entire two hours of this documentary. It's a strange approach, that we might never have seen before. Audiences may have been a bit burnt out on standard music documentaries, after VH1 and their ilk ran through entire genres, proclaiming each band the 'best ever,' with each new installment.

  The Replacements don't fit into that mold. In fact, they never really fit into any mold, not comfortably anyway. So it stands to reason that a doc about them should defy boundaries as well. Maybe the band refused to be part of it, or demanded to be paid when/if director Gorman Bechard went to them about making a doc about them. Maybe the band doesn't know anything about it. Regardless, this is an unconventional doc about an unconventional band, that doesn't have a voice over telling you about who they are/were. This is a bunch of fans, lots of them musicians (many more famous than The Replacements themselves), critics, roadies, anyone at all really, who have a passion for the band.

  This is overflowing with passion, from start to finish, as everyone tells one or more of their favorite anecdotes about the band. Through these stories the history, and more importantly, the impact of the band is laid out. It's very compelling, and obviously deeply personal, for the filmmakers and those on-screen. This is the band who gave voice to a lost generation, who brought the punk and Do It Yourself (DIY) ethos, not to the mainstream, but to a place the mainstream would take its cues from.

  Color Me Obsessed is greatly enjoyable, and a great, if somewhat bizarre, way to get acquainted with the band that made all the other good music possible, but never any satisfaction.

5242264,5,B0091JJ24Q,"I've been waiting for about a year now to see this film again, and didn't hesitate to pre-order it as soon as I heard it was coming out on dvd. The aptly titled Color Me Obsessed is probably the best music documentary in decades; and you'll mostly likely be inclined to check out every Replacements album after you watch it.",1348876800,3,324,4.416666666666667
5242265,5,B0091JJ24Q,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie since I had read that none of the Replacements appear, there is no footage of them performing, and there is none of their music on the soundtrack.  Another concern I had was that since the movie consists mostly of interviews, some of them fan interviews, this might be an amateurish fan-boy effort.  No worries on either account!  Gorman Bechard has done an outstanding job of creating a lively, compelling, thoroughly engrossing documentary despite no involvement from the band.  And the whole thing is very professionally done.

It's true that without any of their music this film probably won't sell the Mats to someone who hasn't heard them - although they may be motivated to learn more based on the heart-felt tributes from their fans.  However, I think anyone with any interest at all in the Replacments will really enjoy this film, as I did.  There is plenty of inside info that I did not know, and many funny stories.  I pre-ordered a copy of this as soon as it was available.  I am looking forward to seeing it again, along with the additional interview material that is included.

For me, one of the film's interesting elements is the inclusion of the sales figures for each of their records, including the re-issues.  I was surprised to see that none of the numbers for their initial releases are outstanding, even their best-known ones.  And the figures for the re-issues are 1/10th or less of the original releases.  For a band that simultaneously held the titles of World's Greatest Rock 'N' Roll Band and World's Greatest Cover Band (and, yes, occasionally The World's Worst in both categories), this was a bit dismaying.  It is shocking to think that a band this good might actually be slipping into obscurity.  Here's hoping that this documentary will spark a revival of interest in this great band.",1348704000,3,1862,4.793103448275862

This really is a must-see for Replacements fans.",1348012800,12,323,4.732142857142857

Got to see Chris Osgood again since I last met him at a show my band played in Mpls in 1991. I really enjoyed the diversity of people interviewed. There was one guy who went on forever that bothered me at first, but then I realized If I was just a little less inhibited I might not stop raving about my appreciation of the Mats as he did. Some folks whine about the lack of music or videos by the band, but I have all those already, so what would the point be? If you found yourself listening to the Mats albums once a day for many years as I used to, then get this movie!",1348012800,5,746,4.116438356164384
5242268,5,B0091JJ24Q,"I will tell you the one problem I had with the film at the end of this review. I will start by saying that this has become my favorite documentary ever!! Now, unlike everyone who appeared in this film and unlike most viewers or fans, I wasn't alive when The Replacements were in their prime. I'm only in my early 20s and I discovered the band back in 2008 from a friend of mine. They have become my favorite band, to the point of obsession.

I won't go on about how there is no music or interviews from the band in the film. I will just say that this was the best way to tell the band's story. The Replacements were sort of that band that you herd about, you knew the name but you didn't know who they were completely. They seemed to be this legend that people had told. It was something that a lot of people had talked about but somewhere in the place of rock history, they were left out when The Beatles, The Velvet Underground or R.E.M. are mentioned. You just knew from what you had heard that they were an important band and you were either curious to listen to their songs or just simply not interested. But my point is, you knew or heard something about them and that is their legacy. The band that no one knows of was simply the greatest band of the 80s or the pioneers of Alternatvie rock.

Was the band that great? I am here to say that yes, they were!! Maybe the only important band to come out of the 80s underground. This film is amazing!! So much insight, humor and heart are in these interviews and it shows what it means to have passion for anything. You don't have to be a fan, even if you're not a Mats fan, you know what it means to have something touch you, make an impact and shape you into the person that you are today. That you're not alone and there is something out there for anyone. Gorman Bechard did a great job with these interviews and got the best out of these fans, fellow musicians or collaborators with The Replacements. This is storytelling and it completely covers a legend that has been told before but never at this scale. This was a little band from Minneapolis that with no record sales, no commercial success has become an important part of rock music and what it is today.

I will end this review by saying the one thing that I didn't like about this film. It's that there is very little praise for the Tim record that The Mats did. Everyone talks about how great Let It Be or Pleased To Meet Me is but hardly any love for Tim. I know it's a difference of opinion but I consider this the best record the band ever did and also, the greatest rock album in history. Still, this is a great film. One that I hope will lead others to discover these songs. Believe me, once you've herd ""Left Of The Dial"", you will never be the same.",1348012800,56,2770,4.212806026365349
5242269,5,B0091JJ24Q,I saw the movie this summer when my friend Todd Owens set up a screening. I've been a fan of the Mats for a long time and was thrilled a movie had been made. Gorman's concept of a documentary about a band that doesn't include anyone from the band or any of their music is brilliant. You get the fans feel for what the band meant to them.,1348012800,4,337,3.9705882352941178
5242270,5,B0091JJ24Q,"I loved the movie and have been obsessing about Color Me Obsessed since seeing it! My high expectations were exceeded -- I was engrossed the whole time, and I loved the interweaving and re-occurring of various elements (Robert Christgau album by album, the writer (Robert Voedisch) who seemed to represent ""everyfan,"" the answering machine scenes almost as bookends, all give the film a continuity that frames the stories contained within). A love for the band and what the Replacements meant to all the story tellers exudes from every story told. I learned a lot, too, and I'm surprisingly glad that the band members themselves or old clips weren't part of the movie. I can't hardly wait for the DVD, with extras!",1348012800,3,714,4.909090909090909
5242271,5,B0091JJ24Q,"As a Replacements fan who has read and seen so much about this band, I really didn't know what to expect when I read that there was a fan documentary being made about the band. When I first heard this movie was being made, I thought it could be interesting, but mostly thought it was unnecessary.

After watching the movie in Madison, I must say I was wrong. I will say if you're unfamiliar with the band, this movie probably isn't for you. There is a lot of history told in the movie, but I'm not sure if all the details are given, and if you don't get what the Replacements were about, you won't get this movie. This movie didn't so much tell the story of the band, but the story of the fans, every last one of us. Watching the interviews was an experience, you knew the stories, you knew the history, but you saw yourself in each and every one of the interviewees.

The story of the band is told fairly linearly, from their birth to their demise. The interviewing and the story telling through the interview clips was fantastic. It wasn't watching a bunch of long interviews, but bits and pieces from everyone intermixed. Just long enough to get you interested, and make you relate to the interviewees, but not so long that you wanted things to move on. Then when they later switched back to someone who you saw on the screen earlier, it seemed natural, like they hadn't left. It allowed them to tell a story in order, without losing the personal feel for the different interviewees.

In many ways, this documentary told a story that so many of us have felt. The replacements are definitely not an ""average"" anything, and their fans fall all over the place as well. In so many ways, I could perfectly relate to everything said in the movie. It's rare I see a documentary about a topic I know so well that still keeps me interested. Normally I think ""I know all of this, what's the point"". In this case, the movie pulls on your emotional strings, and makes you remember where you were when you heard a particular song for the first time, or remember some time in your life that for whatever reason a Replacements' song seems to depict.

The most interest aspect about the movie is that there was so little usage of images of the band, and absolutely no music from the band. At first I thought this would be odd, but for the fans, it really wasn't. When someone was talking about a song, everyone of us had it playing in our head. Things were so well described and played out that having the band in it would have detracted from the movie. Besides, this movie isn't about the band, its about us... every one of us who loves this band.",1348012800,5,2635,4.39344262295082

What this doc has is almost everyone from the Minneapolis scene. I lived there from late 80s through mid nineties and this doc captures the people involved and that special place and time. Its nice to see Oarfolk again...

As other wrote, no videos, music, or even any inside still of the band.  Why bother making a film?

So, as art, this is kinda awful; I definitely wouldn't use it to introduce someone to the 'mats, and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who isn't already a fan. But, if you can take it for what it is, a bunch of interviews with the people who were there (but not the band themselves!), it's a valuable thing for fans. It puts the band in context, which can be hard to do after the fact and with only their recorded output to judge them by.

But, damn, this would have been so much better with a little bit of live footage of the band interspersed throughout, and interviews with the living members of the band. It's almost like the filmmakers set out to have as little to do with the band itself or their music as possible while talking to everyone else who ever had anything to do with the band or liked the band. It had me stopping regularly to find live show recordings from the relevant eras or of the song under discussion on YouTube so I'd have context.
