7090442,3,B00VHAFW3M,"For the Emperor (Hwangjereul Wihayeo) is a Korean crime drama about a disgraced professional baseball player Lee Hwan (cast-against-type Min-ki Lee, Tsunami), who starts working for Emperor Capital, a Busan-based mob-related company organized by Jung Sang Ha (Sung Woong Park, New World).

Three years later, after bloody fights Hwan and Sang-ha successfully control the towns resort business, when another conflict takes place, leading everyone involved into a series of more violent and deadly battles.

Being a fan of Korean film noir, I didn't find the films battles offensive, which features blood-soaked, knife-wielding gangsters stabbing each other (yes, knife is their choice of weapon). What I did not like about the film is the lack of interesting characters and story. For all the graphic violence and nudity, For the Emperor lacks emotional impact that you find aplenty in other Korean thrillers like New World.

For the Emperor is a decent Korean film noir that needs something that is more intense and emotionally-charged.",1437436800,,1036,5.422360248447205
7090443,2,B00VHAFW3M,"Frankly, I was so appalled and horrified, I couldn't continue watching it. I rented it because it had a splendid cast, famous in Korean drama. It was too violent, too bloody, too disrespectful toward women, etc. Maybe the story line was a good one but I never had a chance to find out. Sorry, I can't even give it an honest rating. I thought I was only renting it. If I purchased it, may I return it for a refund.",1437177600,,413,4.175
7090444,5,B00VHAFW3M,"First off, I went into this one completely void of any expectations... didn't even know it came out, or what it was even about.
Also, with a title that made me think it was going to be a political drama, I was skeptical.
But, being a HUGE fan of all things Korean(especially the gangster/crime movies) I figured it was a must have for my Blu-ray collection.

So, my final thoughts after viewing? I DUG IT!

I see that another reviewer stated that it was ""not believable"" and ""basically knife stabbing and martial arts throw-downs""... well, I don't see anything wrong with that. ;)
Hell, I don't watch movies because they're believable, I just wanna be entertained and that's exactly what this one did for me.
This movie, which is loaded with sex, ultra-violence and thoroughly despicable characters(which I come to expect from a gangster flick), is definitely going for a visceral impact and, I would assume, isn't meant to be taken all that seriously. It's got plenty of style to burn and the aerial shots glorifying the Busan night-life we're incredibly handsome to look at in HD, and added a nice touch to the overall aesthetic of the movie's mood. For this being the attempt of a first-time director, I'd have to say- Kudos to you, my man!

All-in-all, I'd say ""For the Emperor"" is definitely a must-see for anyone who's into violent Korean gangster sagas.
Just remember to take-off your over-thinking-it cap, and just enjoy the ride! :)",1436400000,3,1441,4.779116465863454
7090445,1,B00VHAFW3M,"I had thought the Korean studios had turned the corner a year or so ago and started to produce intelligent action crime/thriller films, but this title is a throwback to the old days. Robotic and stereotyped acting (and appearance) for everyone from criminals, to hookers, to cops; to storyline; it's like they were uncreatively formed from a mold of typecast characters of previous similar films.
Disgraced former baseball pitcher, Hwan, accused of throwing games for money turns into an enforcer for organized crime including, of course, sports betting as well as the other standard crime-of-the-day activities. Hwan, despite being skinny and probably having spent most of his young life playing baseball suddenly acquires the skills to turn into a martial arts beast taking multiple baddies down (most much bigger, with knives, and practiced at their art) -  in other words incredulity follows Hwan for the remainder of the film.
He does have a badass stare down though.
The film is basically knife stabbing and martial arts' throw downs (e.g through windows, tables, the usual).
Suggestion: If looking for crime/action film that puts films like this to shame I suggest checking out the ""Justified"" series. LIke comparing junk food to the highest Michelin rated restaurant, ""exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey"".",1436313600,,1323,5.3

8710172,4,B00VHAFW3M,"I would give 5 but I will admit I don't care for the strong violence or some other things but this is still another solid and exciting
film from Korea. saw it on Neflix first then bought it. I really like the relationship between the young kid and older guy. the action is again
strong violence but still exciting to see. I don't want to give anything away I will let you see it for yourself  and write your own review
of what you think.
