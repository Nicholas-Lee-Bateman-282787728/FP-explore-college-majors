6248538,5,B00I3SW3CE,"What a fun movie!  Sort of a spoof of superhero films, but most of the cast are attractive young ladies!  This would probably be an adolescent males perfect movie!  Some good writing and the effects are laughable!  If they do a sequel, I will buy it!",1411776000,2,250,4.369565217391305

6248540,5,B00I3SW3CE,"It's a superheroine/fetish film; a lot of jiggle included with your basic super hero movie tropes.  It doesn't have a big Hollywood studio backing it, so it is low budget (I prefer it this way).  This movie has all of the elements a good superheroine fetish film needs: jiggle, tight colorful costumes on curvy women, pro wrestling grade fight choreography, superheroines in peril, and Jiggle.  Nuff said!",1410566400,7,405,5.014925373134329

6248542,1,B00I3SW3CE,"I wasn't expecting much from a title like this, but I was hoping for a fun, if cheesy, spoof. What I got was an unwatchable mess. Bad acting, no plot to speak of, and a lot of not-so-hot chicks being slapped. My tenant walked in while I was watching this and asked me why I was watching bad porn. Buyer beware - avoid at all costs...",1409702400,20,333,4.0606060606060606

6248544,1,B00I3SW3CE,horrible from start to finish a bad movie in every way that could have been better by adding more imagination and creativity with the many sexy actresses in it that could have make it a great movie unfortunately this one wasn't the case at all,1404259200,5,243,4.4222222222222225
6248545,5,B00I3SW3CE,ok it ain't the best films I've seen but hey there's nudity and boobs and cute girls with super powers that fight the bad and perverted criminals the acting needs some work but for the low price for a boobalicious film I like it. this may or may not be for you but i think for a few bucks for some cuties and nudity it is a good buy.,1403654400,25,333,3.8405797101449277

6248547,3,B00I3SW3CE,"This would be just like if me and my friends, who are no doubt horrible, horrible actors, were to make a superhero movie!

I'd need a bunch of buddies to play bad guys and my female friends who didn't mind wearing skimpy costumes and showing their boobs!
(well all but one).
Note to self: convince female friends to make a movie with me where they show their boobs.

Oh and running out of ""actors"" to play bad guys? Just put masks on them and reuse them!
And don't bother writing a script or dialog. Just let everyone make it up as they go along. I'm sure it'll work out fine.
And if we run out of tape, we'll just end the movie right there!
Proper endings are for suckers.

After reading the reviews in this one I knew I wasn't in for anything good. Fortunately I have a soft spot for really crappy, cheesy B movies.
The girls in this one spend nearly the entire time getting beat up, with their boobs out and being fondled. This would normally bother me, if not for the terribly unrealistic fight scenes that were so cheesy that no one could possibly take it seriously.
So I can't recommend it to anyone, and I'm almost ashamed to say I found it amusing.
Especially since it has no ending! Seriously! It's like they gave up!

6248550,1,B00I3SW3CE,"This movie was terrible.

Terrible acting. Terrible dialogue. Terrible effects. Just....terrible.

The plot (such as it is)....five hot (really semi-hot) ""super heroines"" are brought together to...do something. It's never really clear. Probably 80% of the screen time is nothing more than scenes of the girls being punched in the stomach. Over and over and over and over and over. Seriously.

This movie makes Gigli look like Citizen Kane.",1428019200,9,439,5.426470588235294
