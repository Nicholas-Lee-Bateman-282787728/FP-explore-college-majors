7936532,3,B00005B1XY,"Unfortunately, many classic episodes that might have been restored to DVD were abandoned in favor of this single episode featuring stars Johnny and June Carter Cash. ""The Collection"" clearly made it to DVD on star power alone, since the story isn't a vital one to the _Little House_ bigger picture. Reverend Alden becomes ill after encountering a settlement ravaged by prairie fire and is found by Caleb Hodgekiss (Cash) and his wife. Alden explains that he is from Walnut Grove and is on his way there to collect donations for the folks at the settlement, Graves Corner, who have lost everything they have. Considering himself and his wife more needy than anyone in Graves Corner, Hodgekiss goes to Walnut Grove on an ""errand of mercy"" to collect the items himself, fully intending to flee with his wife and the collection before anyone suspects him. I was surprised to find that Cash actually did a halfway decent job of showing his character's evolution from determined con man to uncertain, softening guy-in-need. The ending is predictable as one would expect from this show, but not altogether lame. Overall, not one I would have personally chosen to promote to DVD immortality, but definitely a watchable hour of _Little House on the Prairie._",998611200,24,1249,4.980861244019139

I am so glad I am able to see this show again and relive the happiness it brought to me so many years ago.",995673600,13,275,3.8421052631578947
