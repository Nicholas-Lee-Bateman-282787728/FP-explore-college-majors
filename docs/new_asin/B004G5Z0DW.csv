4371747,5,B004G5Z0DW,"This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. It was heart-warming, and had the right amount of comedy suitable for any age. E.B. was adorable and hilarious. Russell Brand was the perfect choice. E.B.'s dad is retiring and wants his son to continue on and become the new Easter Bunny, but E.B. doesn't want that life. He runs away to Hollywood to start a new life, but is almost run over by a slacker named Fred O'Hare. Fred is having trouble with his family as well. While Fred is house sitting, E.B. decides to crash with him. Back at Easter Island, a chick named Carlos plots to take over the Easter holiday, unless Fred and E.B. can stop him. I highly recommend HOP!!!",1301961600,48,676,4.416
4371748,5,B004G5Z0DW,"Saw this movie today, and believe me, it's not just for kids. It was so funny, and just listening to my grandaughter laugh because her Grandma was laughing was priceless. Definitely a must see movie, more than once...can't wait to own",1301788800,14,234,4.7317073170731705

4371751,3,B004G5Z0DW,This is not a very good movie in my opinion. It is very cheesy and kind of awkward. I really didn't enjoy it but the kids seemed to.,1526428800,,132,3.75
4371752,3,B004G5Z0DW,I love the movie I just hate that once we rented it we only had 24 hours to watch it. We started watching it in my classroom for our Easter party but never got to finish it due to this policy. So the movie gets 5 stars. Watching it online through Amazon gets 2 stars. So I compromised with three.,1526428800,,296,3.95

4371771,1,B004G5Z0DW,"""Playboy bunny"" and ""sexy bunny"" are not appropriate for childrens movies especially rated PG.

You'd think from the comments that a kid will be scarred for life from this.  Its all fine. We and the kids look forward to watching this every night before Easter.  It's silly and fun.  There are some classic funny lines/scenes that our family enjoys every time we watch it and even joke about occasionally thru the rest of the year (for example the scene when EB slaps Fred in the face as he acts like one of those classic monkey with the symbols toys).  Watch this movie with the idea that it's not rocket science, just a light hearted fun movie, and you will enjoy it!",1522454400,,678,4.392

The plot was tedious and the main issue somewhat unresolved, with a dubious final message for kids old enough to understand (follow your dreams, sort of?). There was a fair amount of love in the animation, so it could have been so much better. Some reviewers said that they liked the lack of potty humor, and I actually kind of agree, but it could remain a sweet story and be put together a lot better.",1493337600,,479,4.322222222222222

4371860,3,B004G5Z0DW,"There once was a disobedient rabbit named E.B. (Russell Brand) who didn't want to be the next Easter Bunny.  He wanted to be a drummer.  He and his father soon had a parting of ways.  There once was a silly slacker named Fred (James Marsden) who didn't want to be anything.  He and his father soon had a parting of ways.  There once was a sinister chick named Carlos (Hank Azaria) who planned a coup d'tat  to takeover Easter.  He, and everyone who wasn't on his side, had a parting of ways (sharp blades were involved as this wasn't intended to be a bloodless coup).

If they had spent as much money on the screenplay as they did the animation this might have been a decent holiday movie.  As it is, some of the plot is more than a little disconcerting (involving the threat of violence, attempting to kill three characters).  It also didn't help that Marsden played his character as a cartoon, all teeth and wild eyes.  Gary Cole was reduced to playing an angry one-note dad.  And why are the bunnies British?  And why does the villain have a Mexican accent?",1492387200,2,1060,4.430051813471502

4371875,2,B004G5Z0DW,"Incredibly stupid. I'll give it credit in two regards though: for starters, it was amusing to see a real world/animated world cross-over again ala ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (the protagonist character being an animated rabbit) and there were a number of scenes that felt vaguely reminiscent of Bob Hoskin's talking to his animated rabbit friend. Second would be James Marsden, who I was surprised to see was a bright and funny actor (I'll confess I can only recall seeing him as 'Cyclops' in the X-men films, and now that I've seen how lively he can be I'm convinced he was terribly miscast in Bryan Singers dreadful films - as well as the atrocious 'Superman Returns.) Plus kudos to whoever cast him with the shaggy hair as he bears a remarkable likeness to a young David Hasselhoff.... then Hasselhoff actually shows up in the film! I can't tell if this was intentional and if the filmmakers had a shrewd sense of humor or if this was unintentional, but I swear, if they ever wanted to reboot Knight Rider then Marsden would be perfect for the role. I'll give the film that much... as for the rest of it, it's the usual brainless animated fare with some live-action cross-over. That part was enough to merit 2 stars, but otherwise this was just mindless bubblegum for kids.",1486166400,,1274,4.691964285714286

4371894,3,B004G5Z0DW,"Hop"" is another movie in a long line of big budget Easter Bunny films, just like...um... well ... er ... I guess there aren't many Easter movies that stick out in my mind.
The team at Illumination Entertainment (who also brought you ""Despicable Me"") tried something new and approached a holiday that hasn't earned much attention from the film industry. Maybe they will set a standard for Easter films and this could be the beginning of Easter films. Or the end.
The movie starts off strong; we are introduced to the hero of the film E.B. (voiced by Russell Brand) (I can only assume E.B. stands for Easter Bunny) who is touring the candy factory with his dad on Easter Island (where else would an Easter Bunny live?). His father (voiced by Hugh Laurie) really wants E.B. to be the next Easter Bunny. Unlike Santa Claus, where there is only one of him that lives for a really long time; there is a long line of Easter Bunnies that have been keeping this Easter tradition alive for 4,000 years (for the Christians, do the math, does something seem fishy? For the Catholics, that fishy pun was intended for you in this Lenten season.) At the same time, we see Fred O'Hare (get it? O'Hare. I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere) as a small child who catches a glimpse of E.B.'s dad delivering Easter eggs. Fred even sees the Easter sleigh (A sleigh? Yes, I must have missed that one as a kid. It's an Easter sleigh towed by hundreds of tiny yellow chicks.).
Fast forward 20 years, Fred (played by James Marsden) is now a grown man living at home with his parents with no job or even a real future. And, E.B. is now a teenager (for any of the viewers, do the math...wait, don't do the math and just go with this one) who wants to drum in a band instead of inheriting the title of Easter Bunny. He runs away to Hollywood to follow his dreams. There Fred literally runs into E.B. with his car. I didn't realize how funny it can be to see a CGI bunny get hit by a car.
Fred and E.B. don't hit it off right away; Fred is pretty sure he is imagining the whole thing. E.B. annoys Fred with his antics and then Fred tries dumping E.B. in the wilderness. E.B. finally proves to Fred that he is the Easter Bunny by pooping out jelly beans. It's fun for the kids, I guess. Fred then remembers the time he saw the Easter Bunny which makes him ignore the fact that he despised this rabbit 10 minutes earlier. Here, as in most kiddie films, the two characters that had their differences and are now best of friends, must work together to fight a common enemy and therefore save Easter.
Should you see this movie? Nope. The CGI and detail put into it was great but they didn't put half as much effort into the story. Sure it was cute and sure it had a few funny moments, but it's just not worth it to see this movie. The kids have probably seen the trailer and want to see the bunny that poops candy. If they are between ages 4 and 9 maybe put the DVD in their Easter basket next year but don't waste 90 minutes for a 15-second joke.",1474243200,,3019,4.288966725043783

4371993,3,B004G5Z0DW,"What a quandary... This 2011 holiday (Easter) film is obviously targeted for the kiddies: it's colorful, includes cartoon characters, and celebrates an icon, the Easter Bunny.

On the other hand, much of the dialogue is fairly adult, e.g., ""Coup d'tat? That's French for coup d'tat!"" If, like me, you find that funny, you'll probably get some kicks out of this one. If not, maybe that six year old in your life will find it hysterical, because a coup d'tat is precisely what this movie is all about. Mr. Easter Bunny, Sr., is thinking about retiring, but like fathers everywhere, he has discovered that his son isn't too thrilled about stepping into his shoes. Junior wants to be a drummer in a rock band. It's an ambitious chick in the candy factory who is planning the coup d'tat.

Meanwhile in the human world, another successful father is equally disappointed: his son hasn't held a job for over a year and despite numerous interviews, discovers, for one reason or another, that not a single one ""is a good fit."" The family's adopted daughter however, intends to be the paragon those parents have craved. She's planning a you-know-what....

These folks make it happen:
  * Russell Brand (""Despicable Me"") brings his quirky charm to ""Hop,"" the callow future Easter Bunny.
  * Hugh Laurie (""House"") is his loving but oblivious father, the current Easter Bunny. He thinks that drumming thing could be a nice little hobby.
  * Hank Azaria (""The Simpsons"") is the (uncredited) supervisor at the candy factory. He's planning the coup d'tat.

When our hero hops down the rabbit hole to escape his destiny, he is transported from Easter Island to Hollywood, where he is promptly hit by a car, driven by:
  * James Marsden (""Enchanted""), the disappointing son in the human world. These two disappointments are thrown together, for good or for ill.
  * Gary Cole is the disappointed father.
  * David Hasselhoff (LOTS of TV) does a cameo and auditions our would-be drummer for his talent show.
The smaller children in the audience became restless, although the seven or eight year olds hooted with delight as a buzz saw nearly sliced off Hop's head. Also, I'm happy to report that the ""Fatal Attraction"" homage went over their heads...boiled bunny anyone?

By the way, the animation is excellent: the interplay between ""live"" humans and the cartoons is seamless. The problem is, there are waaay too many good ideas, as a result none of them are fully developed.",1458777600,,2455,4.87710843373494

They couldn't come up with a more original way for the Easter Bunny to get around and deliver goodies?  They had to copy Santa's sleigh bit?

4372056,3,B004G5Z0DW,"Hop Wants to be an Easter Classic, but It Doesn't Quite Pull It Off

When you ask someone about a holiday classic movie they love, odds are they'll name a Christmas movie.  It's not that others haven't tried to make a movies around other holidays; they just don't usually grab the same punch as the Christmas movies.  Hop is another example.  It wants to become a beloved Easter movie, but it's just average.

E.B. (voiced by Russell Brand) is destined to take over the job of Easter Bunny from his dad (voiced by Hugh Laurie).  There's just one problem - he wants to be a drummer and has no interest in candy or eggs.  Meanwhile, in Van Nuys, Fred O'Hare (James Marsden as a live actor) attempts to find a job he'll be excited about.  His unemployment has gotten to the point that his family holds an intervention for him.

When E.B. runs away to Hollywood to fulfill his dreams, his path crosses with Fred's.  While Fred tries to get rid of E.B. and figure out his life, E.B. worms him way further and further into Fred's life.  Will E.B. ruin Fred's chance at a job?  Will E.B. get to become a drummer?

I can see kids loving this movie.  The plot is pretty well put together, and the story advances quickly.  Not to mention that E.B. is incredibly cute.  The computer animation blends so well with the live actors that you forget that you are watching a blending of the two.

However, adults will find the movie slow.  The plot is fairly predictable, although a couple of things caught me by surprise.  The bigger problem for adults is that the comedy just doesn't work.  Instead of being funny, I found many of the scenes cringe worthy although a few made me laugh.  While kids may enjoy it, I think their parents will not.

I'm not going to lay the blame on the cast.  They try to make the material work.  Honestly, with the actors involved, I'm a bit surprised the film doesn't work better.  Other members of the cast include Kaley Cuoco, Gary Cole, Elizabeth Perkins, and Hank Azaria as the voice of the Easter Bunny's chief assistant.

I guess for me, as I watched, I couldn't help drawing comparisons to The Santa Clause.  The plots are really only similar in passing, but as I watched, it just made me want to watch the Christmas classic instead.

There is a good idea in Hop, but it ultimately just doesn't work as well as it could have.  I guess we'll just have to keep working to find that Easter classic.",1435104000,,2419,4.4340909090909095

4372067,2,B004G5Z0DW,"Sorry but this was a bit too adult for children, even though some of the humor probably went over the children's heads. Putting the Playboy mansion in the story is just not cool. You know the kids are going to ask what is funny about that, and the adults are going to have to explain or lie. Also the main human character (to who's name I have completely forgotten) and his relationship with his father is completely stupid, even for children. The message it sends throughout the story between the father and him all the way to the ending is horrible. There was no redeeming factor to this. The father was only accepting of his son when he realized something amazing about his son? That was the only reason his father would be proud of him? What kind of message is this sending to children? I mean really, what kind of message? This is a horrible thing to express to children. ""You will only be accepted if you show me as your parent that you can do something amazing.""

Am I the only one who realized this movie was making this statement?

Yes the bunny was funny, and there were some really cute moments in the movie which is why I am giving it a 2 star. Ultimately, this movie probably should have a 1 star, but it made me laugh once or twice.",1433462400,16,1246,4.32051282051282

THE OVERALL STORY:
The Easter bunny wanted to retire, and pass the job on to his son, EB. EB did not want to be the new Easter Bunny, but instead he wanted to have a drumming career. EB ends up in Hollywood to escape being the Easter Bunny, and he eventually comes across Fred, a human. Fred was somewhat irresponsible, and he was also living in his sister's bosse's mansion ( in Hollywood). Of course during this time (while EB and Fred tried to live together), back on Easter Island, Carlos the chick, plotted to be the new Easter Bunny/take over Easter.

THE POSITIVES:
(1) This can be either a negative or positive depending on your view point, but their was no love interest for any of the main characters. Personally, I found this very refreshing for story telling. I get tired of watching love stories being dropped into movies when they're really not needed.
(2) This movie had moments where I initially felt that the acting, characters, and one line jokes were going to hit a ""enough is enough"" moment/s. However, it did not. There were times, especially when I found out that EB pooped jelly beans, I thought  that the director would dwell too much on this joke. The movie never crossed the line of over the top anything (acting, jokes, and so on). I really appreciated this, especially from a child's movie.
(3) This movie, for the most part, was age appropriate for all ages. There was no cursing (that I remember), there was no blood, or extreme acts of violence. Even towards the end when it was the show down between ""the good guys versus the bad guys"" it was nothing too intense, or dramatic. To compare ""Hop"" with another film on intensity, I felt that "" Frozen"" was a more intense movie. There are no scenes in Hop that you would need to worry about your child seeing. You can let the DVD play and forget about it. There are no ""Oh no! In ten minutes I need to fast forward this scene because it scares my child""= NO.
(4) The CG was well done. And the combination of CG and live action worked well. I was happy that even though the director made EB adorable, that he/she didn't over do on his cuteness. As an adult you won't role your eyes at EB's  remarks, statements, or overall design. I was fully ready to say ""oh brother"", but I never did.
THE NEGATIVES:
(1) The story at times had holes in it, but nothing that would distract the viewer away from the intertie of the film.
(2) The story was a little predictable at times. It follows a basic story line of a father and son not seeing eye to eye on responsibility. Also two un-likely people who meet, and initially don't like each other (EB and Fred)- but eventually care for one another. However, towards the end when Fred got the idea for his ideal career, the story became more of an original piece of story telling.
(3)This can be either a negative or positive depending on your view point, but their was no love interests for any of the main characters.
(4) This can either be a negative or positive depending on your view point, but there really were no adult jokes within ""Hop"". In most of todays child movies Like ""Shrek"", there are way too much adult based one-line jokes. In ""Hop"" there were very few adult based jokes (I believe there were only 2 or 3). Personally, I appreciated this lack of adult humor. This story reminded the audience that adults can still enjoy a child based movie, even though the film did not contain a lot of adult themes/jokes.
Overall, I really enjoyed this film, and I will watch it again when Easter comes around.",1421884800,21,3578,4.467889908256881

4372329,2,B004G5Z0DW,"I know that not everybody will agree with my opinion on this film, but please hear me out: I've had the chance to watch this film several time, and my opinion is firm. I'll just start of saying that this film is just purely commercial. It seems like it was just made for the extra holiday buck, as some people put it: an ""Easter special that the whole family will enjoy"". Your family MAY enjoy it, but it may not be the best thing.
I can name SEVERAL problems with this film, but the one that really brings down this movie is that it seems like the producers were trying to make this film appealing to all ages, which really isn't a bad thing; but the way that it's done is very, very poor. Them trying to do this, it seems, just turns out to be a big jumble-up of cute bunnies and chicks (the chicken kind, mind you) alongside adult-ish jokes and other stuff. There are some overly cute and childish stuff that will probably bore adults and seem a little child-ly awkward to Teens and Pre-Teens. And there are some pretty ""grown up"" content, like jokes, situations and such that may not be the best thing for younger children (if they can even understand them). Like, there's one ""joke"" were the main (rabbit) character, Eve, is attracted by the gate to the Playboy mansion (because it has a shadow plaque of a rabbit on it) and try's to get in by talking to none other than Hugh Heffner (via an intercom), telling that he's ""incredibly sexy"" and other related stuff.

.....Um, hello? This is supposed to be a CHILD-ORIENTED FILM (or is it?)!!!!!! Were are we getting these remarks about being ""really sexy"" in a movie with fluffy bunnies, adorable chicks and boughs of colorful candy!? Other mature (if that's the right word) content like this pops up several times throughout this movie. Really makes you wonder if this is the right thing to show your kids. But as I said before, isn't this supposed to be a FAMILY movie? It just seems like we go from a colorful world of rabbits and candy and other stuff to outbursts of ""of my g--"" (which was really said several times at one point in the movie) and creatures almost being cleaved in two with machine knives (which also happens in this film). It just likes the makers of this film were just trying to rake up those extra holiday dollars with a mixed-up film that has stuff to childish for grown-ups and content too grown-up for children, but of coarse people will want to watch. I mean, [and I quote Meredith Whitmore and Adam R. Holz]""...what family wouldn't want to go see a silly bunny with an English accent  hop around Hollywood?""[unquote]....basically, this is just one of those films that had the producer's heart put into it: it one of those films that was just made for the pursuit of money. I know that there are allot of people out there who will disagree with me, saying that ""it's the perfect family film"" and stuff like that. It may be a film for the family to watch, but that doesn't mean that it's a film for the family. This film is just pretty much just a big mix-up of Holiday-and-Hollywood cheese, made just for the sake of money. In my mind, it's nothing more.

The idea of a animated film about Easter HAS been done before (Here Comes Peter Cottontail), so it was not a novelty to me.

4372392,4,B004G5Z0DW,"DVD worked great out of the box. Saw the movie in the theater and liked it - this is a real value for the price. I have not tried the Blue Ray disc which also came with the combo pack but I anticipate it will work well also. There are other extra fun things on the disc including the making of the movie, a  hilarious short movie with two of the chicken stars including Carlos and several fun games for the whole family that can be played by simply using the remote control for your DVD player.

There was also supposed to be an electronic version of the movie for downloading according to the advertisement but the offer for the download had expired several months ago and last year some time - long before I ordered the video so I believe this portion of the offer was misleading and should not be advertised as such, however, I still believe this to be a nice value even without the electronic download (Looks like the electronic download was designed for phones possibly - not sure if I would have used it anyway).",1369526400,,1018,4.352631578947369

I watch it whenever it is on cable and now have my own dvd for when I just need to see something lighthearted. Everyone needs those movies where you can just sit and leave stress or worry of the day behind and this, I find, is that kind of movie.  It is like Pete's Dragon or Mary Poppins.

In this economy, anyone can identify with a guy looking for a meaningful job, too - the rabbit, i mean.  Hey.  He's a drummer.  He should be drumming.  And if a scruffy human wants to be the Easter Bunny, well i say equality for everyone.  I found myself wanting to be a Pink Beret!  Runaway Wabbits and revolting Chicks - it's a movie that has just about everything in it.  It appealed to the kid in me, and if i get to feel like a kid again for an hour or so, that's a good thing.

The plot was poorly developed...the Marsden character just suddenly has a change of heart...it was very abrupt and didn't seem to fit the situation.

A few other voices seemed really familiar and we looked them up after the show.  The jelly beans had us laughing like crazy.  It was a lot of fun, lot of giggles, lots of heart.  It held my kids' attention.  I think they watched it 2.5 times in the time we had it rented. Definite Easter favorite!",1364860800,,406,4.075949367088608

Acting was horrible and music was okay (would be better if I liked the rock genres more, I suppose).

And the graphics for the rabbits and the chicks are fine, but the story feels like a rehash of previous Christmas and other holiday tales, of When the son does not want to take over the family business.

4372471,3,B004G5Z0DW,"***WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***

For a while now, I wondered why we don't get that many nonreligious-themed Easter films--and while the idea doesn't appear to hold that much water compared to, say, The Ten Commandments or Ben-Hur, it is a curiosity given that we recieve a ton of nonreligious Christmas movies, but not many for Easter. But I do remember a couple from my childhood--given that they are specials rather than films. Peter Cottontail by Rankin/Bass, a Bearnstein Bears Easter special (gosh, does anybody really remember those books or the cartoon?), and It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown. I don't remember much about either one as I haven't seen them since I was 4 or 5, but I do occassionally chuckle over the Charlie Brown special whenever I look back at my previous viewings (then again, Peanuts always had a wry sense of humor).

And that's where Hop comes in. Not feeling comfortable inheriting the position of Easter Bunny from his father, E.B. runs away from home (located on Easter Island, heh heh), and runs into Cyclops from the X-Men movies--without his glasses, and his condition apparently cured--an unemployed man struggling to secure a job. E.B. wants to be a drummer, and Cyclops wants to inherit the position of Easter Bunny. So the two strike a deal, and hilarity apparently ensues.

The movie may sound like it's screaming ''Alvin and the Chipmunks,'' but props go to the movie for two reasons. One is that the film has a touch of genuine british humor and isn't just crass and vulgar (like, say, all the live action features loosely based on anything Hanna-Barbara had any involvement in in the past). Second is that it does sustain itself well with passable jokes throughout the 95 minute running time and doesn't simply feel like filler. Two key gags involve everyone taking in a talking bunny rather well and almost instantaneously, and another being the scene where Russell Brand in a cameo appearance is talking to E.B.--the protagonist in which he provides the voice for.

No, I am not a Russel Brand fan, and his comedies--I'm mostly referring to the likes of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek here, but Bedtime Stories falls under the radar as well--are rather quite revolting to say the least. And there are plenty of moments in that film that do fall under the radar (remember, this film was directed by the same guy that gave us Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties, and the first Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, after all). A prime example is a gag in which E.B. would continuously produce fruit-flavored jelly bean pellets, which was a joke better off left on the cutting room floor. Another--in which the antagonists were all chicks with hispanic accents--just doesn't make much sense at all (if one were to give the villains of the piece a separate accent from the English-speaking rabbits, it would have made more sense to make them French or German, anyways). Another scene shows the two lead characters ruining a gradeschool pageant in which the quality seemed to have screamed Cool As Ice (in the aforementioned movie, the music in the prom was made to be absolutely dreadful just to make Vannilla Ice look talented by comparison).

I will not question E.B. unwittingly backstabbing Cyclops near the end by feining his death. He was overconfident that his friend could fend for himself, and the doubleuntandre worked as a double-edge sword (he put his vest on a turkey boiling in a pan to trick the Pink Berets into thinking that he's dead, whilst simultaneously ''dressing the turkey'' if you will). The intended gag works, but in return, it does conflict with the characters themselves AND the narrative flow in general. That, and the ending seemed anticlimatic (let's just say, the gag worked better in Pikachu's Gotta Dance!).

So is it bad? Mmmm....yeah. Is it dreadful? No. Is it even watchable? Barely. If anything, the jokes do sustain themselves throughout the film, but they aren't clever enough to warrant repeat viewings. It's essentially a film with only one good trick, and not enough substance to warrant being the film's saving grace. For casual viewing, I'd give it a 4 out of 10. But if you have kids, it'd be a 1 instead; I just can't fathom the idea of allowing children to watch these sorts of films without fearing the effects they will have on their brains. And heading towards the direction of films like that, it's better for them to watch films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit or the Shrek films.

So by Amazon standards, that would probably make it a 3 out of 5 (though just barely).  Just don't let your kid watch this.  At least not until they are in Middle School.",1360454400,,4662,4.802992518703242

Instead of signaling (as I'd hoped) the rise of another great animation studio, Hop makes me fear for the upcoming Despicable Me sequel. Perhaps these people AREN'T that brilliant after all; perhaps they merely got lucky.

Somewhat surprisingly, this movie begins by giving away a big part of the ending, that slacker Fred becomes the first human Easter Bunny, but after you've suffered through it the reason becomes obvious: to keep the audience from hating E.B. even more as we watch him callously and selfishly ruining Fred's life.

By far the best part of the movie follows as viewers along with a young E.B. are taken upon an extensive tour of the amazing factory that makes all the goodies that go into Easter baskets; enjoy it while it lasts because it is all downhill from here.

Many years later, the once adorably cute young E.B. is now grown, though far from grownup.  Faced with a father who refuses to listen to his last minute announcement that he wants to be a drummer not the Easter Bunny, E.B. does what any selfish and useless slacker would do;

he bails for Hollywood two weeks before Easter, leaving chaos in his wake and bringing a lot of chaos with him into the human world, specifically into the life of another useless slacker, Fred O'Hare whose family is shown engaging in a desperate and unfunny parody of an ""intervention"" in order to get his lazy rear end off the couch and back into the working world.  Despite ham-handed attempts to make his family into the bad guys, it is hard not to despise callous and selfish Fred...

until even more despicable E.B. shows up and does the impossible: make the audience occasionally sympathize with Fred because he's finally met someone less likable than he is.  The absolute nadir has to be when while selfishly stowing away with Fred (after promising not to) E.B. pops out and pushes Fred into ruining his adopted baby sister's Easter pageant for no apparent reason other than his own selfish cruelty.  (I guess it's supposed to be ""OK"" because she's first shown singing very badly, but Fred's deliberately made to be loathsome father has it right when he sums it up as ""upstaging grade schoolers"".)  What makes it even worse is that we can see Alex O'Hare (Tiffany Espensen) in the background becoming increasingly upset as her brother (apparently quite deliberately) ruins her big day (she had the starring role).

How sick do you have to be to even THINK this might be funny?

E.B.'s last minute change of heart (from being totally heartless) isn't remotely believable, and not even Carlos' (Hank Azaria's) lunatic, vicious, borderline racist, and occasionally funny coup attempt can save this disaster or redeem its sociopath of a hero.",1341964800,6,2949,5.106029106029106

I wasn't sure based on the previews, but I like computer animation, and the characters were cute, so I decided to give it a shot. I was immediately drawn in by the beautiful scenes of the candy factory and wanted to eat my favorite - jelly beans - and lots of other candies. That went away later when they decided to cleverly make the Easter Bunny poop jelly beans. Nasty.

I think it was a shame that they informed us from the opening scenes that Fred O'Hare was going to become the first human Easter Bunny. Kind of messed up the suspense a bit, didn't it? And why were they so opposed to there being an Easter Chick but not an Easter Human? Oh well. A lot of the movie was really funny and the interaction between Fred and the animated characters was excellent. It is also nice to have an Easter movie. I have so many Christmas movies.

4372550,2,B004G5Z0DW,"After my 3 year old daughter seen this movie in the store we decided to get it for her for Easter. We got it from Amazon.com seeing as it is triple points. When we got the movie all was good at first. The main reason we got it was to put it on her iPod with all her other movies and tv shows. After going to Universal web page and doing the stuff there it took me to iTunes. When in iTunes the d/l started and it was d/ling something called Hop iTunes extras. Not real sure what that is as I have never seen it d/l any extras before. The movie would get to 10 mb d/led and would error out. I called iTunes and they had me turn off my virus scan and empty my cookies and delete the file from my iTunes folder. All of this took about 2 hours on the phone and when I tried to d/l it again it did the same thing so i had to call iTunes back. After another 2 hour phone call, iTunes told me to delete iTunes and my virus scan all together and try again. Sorry no. So I went and tried it on a different computer that is linked to my account and it still did the same thing. I called iTunes back and they told me to try to d/l it from a different network. So in other words they wanted me to load my pc up and take it another location. Sorry no. I did however try to d/l it to my iPod at another location but it also errored and stopped. Itunes has the cload now so I d/led another movie that I own on iTunes without any problems. I also d/led about 10 free tv show episodes with out problems. Next phone call I had with iTunes they told me to get another redeem code from Universal so I did and it had the same problem as the first one. I have not heard back from iTunes in over 2 weeks so think I just gave up. So the final conclusion is, if you are buying this movie for the iTunes didgital copy be warned, it might work, and in my case after 7 hours on the phone, 2 redeem codes, and over 15 hours fighting with it, it might not.",1335830400,2,1926,3.841708542713568

4372554,3,B004G5Z0DW,"As mentioned in other reviews, this is a combo animated/live-action film about Easter.  EB, the ""heir"" to the Easter Bunny throne, runs away from home to follow his dreams of playing drums professionally.  He ultimately ends up with Fred O'Hare (played by James Marsden), who is a dreamer who doesn't fit into any job and is being forced to find work by his family.  Mayhem ensues, with EB defecating jelly beans and basically making life havoc for Fred.  After misadventures at a video game company and a run-in with a famous talent-searcher, Fred and EB end up saving Easter from the diabolical chick assistant Carlos (and finding their own dreams and friendship after all).

First of all, the film is absolutely gorgeous.  The scenes of the Easter Factory are beautiful -- some of the most wonderfully animated settings I have seen.  The studio does a great job of fitting EB and other characters into the real world, down to shots normally missed such as shadows and reflections.

The voice and live acting are pretty good, with Russell Brand performing as EB. James Marsden interacts well with the animated characters as well.

On the downside, for most of the film it is almost impossible to find interest or care for the characters.  EB is a spoiled child who does everything he wants to wreck other lives, and Fred is a dreamer who tries to deal with the wreckage.  It's kind of unfortunate that you can't find empathy for either child, both of whom are trying to please their fathers but failing.  Finally by the last 15 minutes of the movie you find that EB and Fred can compromise, work together, and reach their dreams while reconciling with their families.  But if you can't make it through the first 3/4's (most of which involves making humorous messes and some potty humor) of the movie to that point, you probably won't really care about the ending.",1335398400,,1865,4.7368421052631575

Not to mention it's nice to find a film without too much potty humor that seems to get thrown into the little kids movies. OK, so the Easter Bunny poops jelly-beans, but that's IT. (And that made the kids laugh SO hard.) Russell Brand as the voice of the Easter Bunny is  hilarious, and James Marsden as the hapless guy who just wants the approval from his father he never got is so sweet and funny too, as well as Kaley Cuoco with those big-eyed faces she can make when she's surprised.

The candy factory, reminiscent of Willy Wonka, the egg sleigh pulled by hundreds of little chickies--- awesome. And the under-arching story with an actual MORAL... nice.

4372563,4,B004G5Z0DW,"Knew nothing about this one when we rented it for our family movie night with the kids (7 & 3), so my expectations were low.  I was pleasantly surprised by this wholesome, cute, and fairly consistently funny little flick.  The story centers around a slacker 30ish guy living at home, mostly unemployed, and without any direction or motivation, much to the chagrin of his family.  Simultaneously we meet a similarly unmotivated, directionless slacker bunny living near Easter Island with his father (none other than the Easter Bunny) shunning the expectation that he'll take over for his father and hoping instead to become a famous drummer.  The paths of young human and young rabbit meet and together they help one another grow up & discover their true callings.
The animation is top notch, and the mixture of live action & animation is handled seamlessly to winsome effect.  The overall attitude is family-friendly with only a few possibly objectionable bits: a brief scene where the bunny tries to get into the Playboy Mansion because he's heard it's where 'sexy' bunnies go & he considers himself sexy, and a few utterances of ""Oh my God.""  The PG rating is appropriate but it's a very mild PG and probably suitable for all ages.  Even our 3 year old found nothing to be frightened by, which is unusual.
The biggest strengths are crisp writing and humor that works for the most part.  There were several laugh out loud slapstick scenes and the whole thing is just pretty fun.  Overall a lightweight but pleasant movie with a good sense of humor and broad appeal.  Recommended for a rental.",1334966400,,1593,4.823529411764706

I don't think it was as funny as some movies but my son did love the humor. There were a few parts in it that they could have left out so that it could have been G rated which would be much more appealing to be able to show it at school for a movie night. One example of inappropriate which would go over kids heads anyway and has nothing to do with the story line is that the Bunny tries to live at the Playboy mansion. The only thing you see is him outside the gate with the ""bunny tux logo"" and he does not get it. I take it the humor was for the adults, but it really didn't need to be in there.

As a movie, Hop is to Easter what Rudolph is to Christmas - a non-religious, cute holiday-themed movie about misfits who find their way.

So I admit at having some trepidation putting down money and setting aside time to screen this latest entry into the genre.

Tells the story of E.B. - the young heir to the long line of Easter holiday icons. Unfortunately, his interest lies less in his chocolate and sweet confectionary heritage, and more with two-stick bangers like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neil-Peart/dp/B000001ESP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neil Peart</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stewart-Copeland/dp/B00008BRB5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stewart Copeland</a>. His dreams involve pounding music, pounding beats, and pounding bunny babes, not delivering goodies to the children of the world.

So what's a bunny to do? Escape to Hollywood of course.

While not as explosively funny and creatively innovative as the Zemeckis rabbit production of years past - I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It's bright, witty, and charged with enough go power to keep pace with an adult's expectation, while still delivering what's essentially a kids movie.

Admittedly, I would've enjoyed a few more double-entrdes worked into the script like, ""I am sick of doing Number Two - it is time for Number One!"", but that's just the old fogey in me. Did love that E.B. did his business in the form jellybeans. Watermelon! Yum!

Not.

No surprise - the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jelly-Belly-Company/dp/B0015D43OA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jelly Belly Company</a>&nbsp;wasn't offered a sponsorship deal. :-D

Very enjoyable flick which ended with my wife asking me if it were time to add a cute floppy-earred friend to our family of felines. I said yes, with the understanding that I wouldn't partake in any morgue-type-CSI-clean-ups.

Personal Note: Was kind of surprised to hear Bow Wow Wow's ""I Want Candy"" as the theme for this kids flick without any squawking from indignant parents. I suppose it's a sign of the passing decades that the original meaning of the song has been obscured and converted into a hip-hop dance ditty. No pun intended. I can remember when a constant near-naked, ground-humping 15-year old Annabella Lwin was the scandal-sensation-du-jour which helped fuel the fire that grew into the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PMRC/dp/0688167721/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PMRC</a>.

My daughters love it and want their own E.B. It is perfect for family movie nights because both young and old will enjoy. Even the bonus features are very entertaining.

4372581,3,B004G5Z0DW,"Easter Island is the home of the facility that produces all the candy for the Easter holiday and it is managed by the current Easter bunny in charge.  It is a tradition going back over 4,000 years (Apparently Easter has nothing to do with the resurrection of Jesus Christ). The Easter bunny's son is named EB and he is the heir apparent to become the next Easter bunny.  Unfortunately EB wants to be a drummer rock star and he has no interest in being the Easter bunny.

This brings in Fred O'Hare (James Marsden) who is a loser son in a family of motivated people.  Fred can't even hold a job, or find one, while his family thrives on being somewhat successful.  EB and Fred cross paths and the fun begins as EB tries to fulfill his dream of being a drummer and Fred discovers that he wants to be the Easter bunny.

This movie features marvelous animation and it really is spectacular. The computer generated graphics and color are just perfect.  The views of the candy production area under Easter Island are well done and the jelly bean waterfalls are like a natural beauty.  Unfortunately the acting is simply over the top and overdone to the point of being fake. Fred O'Hare's (James Marsden) role is simply the village idiot and the acting role is so unrealistic is really was not even fun for me to watch.

My grandson loved the movie but my wife and I felt it was only average.  It is sad too that this movie has such great computer animation and the combination of the animation into the real world video is perfectly done. The acting is below average for the main character and the storyline for the humans is so very weak that it actually detracts from the movies value.

Call me old fashion, but was it really worth saying that Easter has been celebrated for over 4,000 years which leads one to assume that it is in no way related with the resurrection of Jesus?  This one line statement was totally out of context and frankly I didn't appreciate it being stated.",1333584000,,1975,4.47075208913649

The animation is GORGEOUS too, especially the scenes shot on Easter Island with all the beautiful egg-motifs and the spectacular candy factory with the rainbow rivers of jelly beans.  This movie does for the Easter Bunny what other movies have done for Santa Claus -- and the Easter Bunny even gets a sleigh like Santa has!  I just loved this movie...and I can watch it when it's not Easter as well, but I will DEFINITELY be watching this one every year on Easter itself from now on.  It's funny, silly, colorful, and is great for the whole family.

Definitely worth the price of a rental here on Amazon and also a good investment to buy because you will be able to watch it many times and get your money's worth.  And did I mention that James Marsden is adorable?",1333238400,,839,4.450980392156863

Like other reviewers said, the beginning and middle of the movie are very entertaining, lots of comedy thanks to Russell Brand & the rising star, James Marsden, but the end is pretty cheesy and doesn't end with the fun feeling that the rest of the movie had. Also could have done without the bunny playing the drums.. a little too much like the chipmunks...or ""the Hoff""... Overall, a very cute Easter movie!",1332806400,,646,4.568965517241379
4372590,2,B004G5Z0DW,"If you go into this hoping it is another clever, funny creation like ""Despicable Me"" then you will be sorely disappointed.  If you are hoping for a candy colored adorable ride through the world of the Easter bunny, you will also be disappointed.  If what you are looking for is more along the lines of the Smurf and Chipmunks CGI/live action mashups, then you will come away at least somewhat satisfied, but that sure is a low bar to set for a film...

Hop starts off at quite the encouraging hop.  E.B. as a baby bunny with his huge cotton tail and adorable mannerisms is just too precious for words.  He is being raised to take over for his father, who is THE current Easter Bunny and the one that makes it happen every Easter.  All those eggs and baskets in such a short time, even the little bunny is feeling pressured already to fill in such huge rabbit shoes.  One of the best parts of the movie is here, a look into the glorious factory that makes all the candy on Easter Island.  It is cleverly designed with rainbows of skittles, shiny Hershey's kisses, chocolate easter bunnies, baskets being filled, it's controlled chaos in a sticky sweet setting that is clever and awe inspiring.  It gives you hope for the film... that is until you see the interview with the script writers in the extras.  All they had to write was ""factory"" and OTHER people did all the work in making that something memorable.  Too bad their imaginations weren't set free on the story for Hop, otherwise we'd see something better than a movie concocted by people boring enough to just write ""factory"" and be done with it...

E.B. grows up to be an antsy, rebellious, plaid wearing teenager.  He looks like something from the mid 90s or a skater kid in a bunny suit.  His dream is to drum... not be an Easter Bunny so instead of stepping up to the plate on the eve of his coronation as new Easter Bunny, he takes off, slacks off and annoys his way into the life of slacker Fred O'Hare, a human who has let his father down as well, by being a leech on his family's goodwill and a sofa landmark.  They throw Fred out of the house for not getting grown up enough to even get a burger slinging job, but instead of being taught a lesson by having to sleep in his car or turn in some resumes, his sister sneaks out and gives him the keys to a mansion.  She just happens to be house sitting her boss's mansion... how convenient!

So slacker E.B. and slacker Fred end up together in a mansion and hijinks ensue, although nothing particularly interesting.  There's a big with David Hasselhoff.  There's a rather inappropriate bit about the Playboy mansion as well, which was just insulting to have in a children's movie.  They didn't take it far enough to have to explain anything to my kids at least, but i'm sure others picked up on it.  And nothing in the movie particularly does anything amusing or right after that... the pink beret bunnies that are let out to capture E.B. and bring him back to Easter Island (under his father's orders) are adorable, and offer a bit of tension but they aren't fully realized either.

There's a happy ending, a chick that wants to take over and be the Easter Bunny and almost kills E.B., Fred and The Easter Bunny by lowering them into some kind of boiling confection liquid, and they let the bird off the hook by the end... it's all swept under the rug.  Fred gets his dream job - of being the Easter Bunny (what?) and E.B. grows up just enough to realize he can drum AND be the co-Easter Bunny.  Roll credits.

The kids liked it, but this is not one that many grown ups will want to be revisiting with its tired gags and embarrassing moments.  The rabbit getting overly friendly with Fred's sister and asking afterward if she's available was a cringe worthy creepy moment... that went on far too long.  Unfortunately HOP is filled with way too many of these eye-rolling bits that just make you wish it would all go back to Easter Island... at least things were more interesting and fantastical there.",1332547200,2,4014,4.4555403556771545
4372591,5,B004G5Z0DW,"Okay, HOP is just too cute for its own good, but is that a crime?  Not if the cuteness is doled out purposefully as it is in HOP.  How else can you do a movie about the Easter Bunny if you don't dispend belief and hop on the fantasy bandwagon.  Devised by the same team that gave us the far superior DESPICABLE ME, the movie is just what I expected---and I had a good time watching it.  James Marsden as the main human brings a wide-eyed ""Aw Shucks"" charm to his role as the ne'er-do-well slacker who bonds with the rebellious E.B. Who wants to be a drumming superstar.  Russell Brand, better heard than seen, voices E.B. Perfectly.  Kaley Cuolo, Elizabeth Perkins and Gary Cole provide minimal support as Marsden's disgruntled family and Chelsea Handler & David Hasselhoff provide amusing cameos.  Hugh Laurie gives veddy British voice to EB's father but it is the always scene stealing Hank Azaria whose voicing of the treacherous chick Carlos provides the most fun.
HOP is far more enjoyable than similar live/animation misfires like ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS or the awful GARFIELD franchises.

4372593,5,B004G5Z0DW,"Honestly, there are so many great things about it! It's a fine film for any age, with plenty of humor that is genuinely funny for adults as well as kids, and the adult humor is not inappropriate for the younger set. The animation is fantastic and fully believable in the real-world, the pacing is some of the best I've seen, and the human characters are beautifully cast and all excellently played as well. There is no forced romance with an unnecessary love interest, because they do the right thing (for once) and don't have an unnecessary love interest! Yes, this movie is totally safe for the lovelorn or those who just don't like seeing unnecessary romances in movies that aren't about that! What IS it about? It's an Easter movie! Yes, an actual Easter movie that isn't religious. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate the religious Easter movies too, even if I'm not so religious anymore, but it's nice to have something to watch on Easter (feature-length, I mean) that gives us a break from the religious stuff and still is about the holiday. If you have kids, this movie should be a real Easter treat for them, but I don't have kids and still LOVE it. It's just so much fun, I can really relate to the lead human character (A LOT), and the Pink Berets, they are just too adorable! I want to hug them to death (well, maybe not to death), especially the little one, Bit! I had to get the figurines of all three of them!

But, I'm getting ahead of myself here, let me give a little on the plot. ""Hop"" is a film about E.B. (Russell Brand), the son of the current Easter Bunny (Hugh Laurie), who would rather drum in a band than follow in his father's paw-prints. It's also about Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), a directionless young man who is being pushed by his family to find a job and get his own place, but who just can't stand to settle into a life that isn't amazing. Lucky for both Fred and E.B. that their paths cross when E.B. runs away from their Wonka-esque candy factory on Easter Island to pursue his dream in Hollywood! Unfortunately for E.B., his father sends his elite royal guards, the Pink Berets (three cuter than cute girl bunnies) to retrieve him, and even worse, the Easter Bunny's number one chick, Carlos, decides now is the perfect time to stage a takeover and become the new Easter... Chick!

There's also one other huge aspect of the plot that I normally wouldn't give away, because it would normally be a huge spoiler. The big, surprise ending. However, if this film has any flaws, it's that this potential surprise ending is revealed at the beginning of the film, literally in the opening! Yeah, just like in the original Salem's Lot. I can't for the life of me understand why some films do this. So, it's no spoiler to say that in the end of the film, Fred becomes the new (and first human) Easter Bunny. Honestly, even when he comes up with the idea and E.B. starts training him in the hopes that they can switch places, so to speak, it still seems unlikely that things will turn out with Fred as the new Easter Bunny, but they don't get to surprise us with that great turnout because they revealed it in the opening credits narration. Oh well. So, yeah, this film isn't perfect, but that one, pretty silly move on the filmmakers' part is the only glaring mistake. Having said that, I do love the idea of how things worked out for Fred since it was done in a way to even satisfy those of us who were a little concerned about not having a rabbit in that sacred position.

Now, some might say they should have at least given one nod to the religious aspects of Easter, and I'll agree that some sort of allusion could have done just a bit more to make this a perfect Easter film that doesn't miss a beat, but I can live with it being wholly secular since almost every other feature film related to Easter is wholly religious. Something that bothered me a little bit more (and, again, not much, and even less upon repeat viewings) were little Christmas similarities. Most significantly, the fact that the Easter Bunny drives a flying sleigh in this film (it looks very Easter-ish and is pulled by a flock of chicks, but still...). If they hadn't made a joke by calling out the chicks' names, Santa-style, at the end of the film, it wouldn't have bugged me so much. It just would have been nice to avoid any Christmas references in this Easter film (I love Christmas, but do the other holidays always have to bow down to it? I also get bugged when the other monsters are made to bow down to Dracula), but nevertheless, it is a fantastic film! Gotta watch this one once a year at the very least! Definitely a new favorite of mine!

The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack gives perfect picture and sound, and a handful of extras. The most boasted of is an all-new Mini-Movie. Now, I highly recommend picking this up, because the movie is so fantastic and also because there aren't many movies out there for Easter anyway, even when you include holiday specials (my picks in that area being Charlie Brown and Rankin/Bass's original Here Comes Peter Cottontail). But, don't be swayed over the Mini Movie. That was lame. I mean, it was not like one of those bonus cartoons PIXAR adds to its releases. This was basically just Carlos and Phil, the two chicks from the film (and, all through this review, when I say chicks, I mean baby chickens, though these chicks are adults that permanently look like chicks), dancing on a while background. Seriously. It was like an animation test, really, not a mini movie. I was hoping it might be a new Pink Berets adventure, but no such luck. It was no kind of adventure at all, and Hank Azaria didn't even provide the voices this time. I could tell right away that Carlos was played by Jim Cummings in this short and elsewhere on the disc. The other bonus features were a mixed bag too. There is a collection of behind the scenes interviews that should have just been presented as one featurettes, preferably with more material, but it was a nice inclusion anyway. I don't care much for DVD games, but they do have a trio of decent ones for the kiddies here. There are also some special Blu-Ray enhancement gimmicks of the kind I usually don't bother with (BDLive and all that sort of thing). Too bad movies like this rarely get commentary tracks, and I didn't see the theatrical trailer or anything of that nature on the disc. So, yeah, the bonus features aren't much, but the movie is a must own if you have any love for Easter at all.",1332547200,2,6500,4.482700421940928

  That's not all but if I give away more, that's the whole movie pretty much. The movie feels a little rushed and half the time Marsden doesn't seem to even be looking in the direction of the CGI bunny. I know it's silly to say, but Matthew Lillard at least managed to some how have chemistry with the CGI Scooby Doo in those films. I like Marsden but he feels a bit awkward in Hop.

4372597,5,B004G5Z0DW,"'Hop' is a fun little Easter flick, that won me over quickly. I am happy owner of two rabbits who I absolutely love and E.B. reminded me SO much of one of my bunnies. Some of the references to recent movies and stars will unfortunately date it as the years pass, but I can forgive that part of it. From a rabbit lovers perspective, this movie includes some really important things about bunnies and rabbit ownership, without being preachy.

There is a scene where the main character Fred, in an attempt to get rid of E.B., takes him to an outdoor location and tries to leave him there. We are quickly reminded that a domesticated rabbit isn't fit for life in the wild. It's the sad fate of many 'Easter bunnies' bought during the holiday for children, that once the rabbit gets bigger (and has usually not been spayed or neutered) and develops unwanted behaviors, that they are either taken to a shelter, or dumped in the wild on the assumption that rabbits are 'wild' animals and can handle the outdoors just fine. This of course is not true and a rabbit is not an Easter toy, but an involved pet equal to a dog or cat. Google search the 'Make Mine Chocolate' campaign for more info on humane rabbit treatment.

There are also bits of rabbit info humor that made me laugh, as when E.B. points out that rabbits can't vomit, so when he sees something that makes him feel sick all he can do is gag. I also loved the 'Easter Island' backdrop, with those mysterious statues that have fascinated me since I was a kid! The 'Pink Beret' segments are wonderful as well. The friend I saw this with has asthma, and one of the Pink Beret bunnies uses an inhaler after some of the action scenes, which was a funny little touch that made her giggle.

In the end, it's a good story that includes bunnies, chicks and tons of Easter candy! You may want to have your Cadbury eggs and marshmallow Peeps lined up for watching this one. I love a heavy drama as much as the next person, but if you just want to be a little silly and do the 'hop', it's quite perfect.",1332374400,,2045,4.362204724409449

4372604,1,B004G5Z0DW,"On March 23, 2012, Universal Pictures will release the Easter-themed film, Hop, on Blu-ray and DVD. Although some hail Hop as a family-friendly Easter classic, the message of this film is something far more insidious. Akin to the worst examples of racial and ethnic stereotyping found in twentieth century film, the not-so-subtle message of Hop is that those who speak with a ""Spanish"" dialect do not count in American society. Put another way, Hop depicts Hispanics as deluded and dangerous for believing that they can ascend to a position of employment beyond that of menial labor.

Despite public controversy surrounding the film's initial release on April 1, 2011, Universal Pictures has decided to move ahead with a home video release of the film that they describe as a ""comic tale"" that blends ""state-of-the-art animation with live action."" Universal's cheerful press description omits the offensive subplot that revolves around the actions of Carlos (Hank Azaria), a possible heir to the Easter Bunny mantle.

In fact, the majority of the press about the film ignores the Carlos character and instead dwells on the relationship between EB and Fred O'Hare. EB (Russell Brand) is the son of the retiring Easter Bunny. Unwilling to follow in his father's footsteps, EB flees to Hollywood to pursue his dream of becoming a rock drummer. Back in the live-action world, the audience meets Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), the unambitious and irresponsible son of Henry O'Hare (Gary Cole). Despite his pattern of unreliability, Fred gets the opportunity to housesit a multi-million dollar home. Predictably, Fred encounters and injures runaway EB. ""Hilarity"" ensues as EB ransacks the home, plays his rock drums, and slowly wins the friendship of Fred.

Meanwhile, the picture is much less rosy in the animated Easter world. EB's father is beside himself with worry about his missing son and fears that he will have to cancel Easter. Carlos, a loyal factory supervisor, steps forward to offer his assistance to EB's father. He articulates a compelling case for why, in the absence of EB, he should become the next Easter Bunny. After all, he has worked in the factory for years, knows the entire production process, and is familiar to the workers. EB's father scoffs at the idea and informs him that a chicken can never become the Easter Bunny.

Regardless of his tireless loyalty and ample qualifications, Hop boldly ridicules even the suggestion that ""Carlos"" can become the Easter Bunny. Admittedly, it would not seem racist, or even far-fetched, to suggest that the Easter Bunny should in fact be a bunny. However, the consistent negative portrayal of Carlos and the film's denouement ultimately reveal the true reason Carlos cannot become the Easter Bunny: his ethnicity.

Inexplicably, the filmmakers choose to racialize the character of Carlos. Throughout the film, Carlos speaks in broken English with a strong mock-Spanish dialect. Imagine how this film might have been received had the Carlos character been renamed ""Chang"" and unable to discern his ""Rs"" from his ""Ls."" Likewise, what if he had been named ""Darius"" and spoke with a mock, African-American dialect?

Hop doubles down on persisting stereotypes of Hispanics in American film and television. First, Carlos is not depicted simply owning or transporting chickens (as is often the case in American television and film), he literally is a chicken, or more precisely, un pollito. Second, his broken English and mixed metaphors encourage the audience to laugh at and mock him. Consequently, the film reinforces the belief that Mexicans who speak English with a thick accent are somehow stupid, unqualified, or a joke.

Sadly, the film dashes the viewer's hope that the negative portrayal of Carlos is actually somehow subversive. Replete with weaponry and violence, Carlos leads a failed Che Guevara-style revolution at the factory that ultimately leaves him disfigured. Banished, Carlos leaves his chick henchmen to toil in the factory with no hope of a better life. Ironically, the film then playfully resolves by declaring the conspicuously human Fred O'Hare ""co-Easter Bunny."" The audience is left to ponder why this entitled, untalented, lazy, white twenty-something is more qualified to be Easter Bunny than the loyal and hardworking Carlos.

Hop is disturbing for what it reveals about Universal Pictures and American culture more generally. It suggests that Universal Pictures, or at the very least the production team of Hop, involved very few culturally aware individuals in positions of authority. The racial subtext of this film is glaringly evident for anyone who has even tangentially experienced discrimination based on race, class, religion, gender, or sexual preference. Secondly, it suggests that American consumers are blind to, or perhaps even comfortable with, the negative portrayals of Hispanics advanced in American television and film today. As consumers, we need to relegate Hop to the dustbin of history alongside decaying reels containing the faces of Charlie Chan and Uncle Remus.",1330646400,9,5072,5.291925465838509

After falling out with his father, E.B. leaves Easter Island to Hollywood to try and see his dreams through... I thought that the movie was great as it had a great story and special effects to boot... Same thing about the young man E.B. meets up with... The father wants to push his son into a working situation that he is not happy with..  The moral of the story is to follow your dreams and to never give up on them...

The effects blew me away.. When E.B. plays the drums, it looks so real... You forget that you are watching something that was created on a computer...

The yellow chick that worked with the Easter Bunny got on my nerves as he works to overtake the Easter Bunny job... Other then that... A great movie for the young at heart... Bring on The Blu Ray!",1315440000,5,933,4.1722222222222225

4372614,3,B004G5Z0DW,"""Hop"" (2011) is a family picture strongly reminiscent of a 2007 film ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" - a comedy seamlessly merging live-action actors and animation characters. Both pictures are harmless and mindless fun (helmed by the same director Tim Hill, incidentally), kind of movie that would achieve 100 million dollars mark in ticket sales while ridiculed by critics. Actually, ""Hop"" is not that bad, thanks to the state-of-the-art special effects, though you really have to ignore the incredible storyline.

A young rabbit E.B. wants to be a drummer, but his daddy Mr. Bunny - who happens to be the Easter Bunny - would not listen. So, to make his dream come true, E.B. runs away from his home on Easter Island, and travels to Hollywood, where he encounters Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), a slacker who discovers his true calling when he discovers the identity of the speaking rabbit. Well, I think you know what it is.

Obviously there are so many wrong things about the film. The story is far from coherent. James Marsden (born in 1973) is too old for the role. The film also feels like dj vu at times. Mr. Bunny's factory, though beautifully designed, reminds us of a recent Tim Burton film, or the idea of hundreds of working chickens seems to have come from ""Despicable Me"" and its yellow-colored minions. Cameos of Blind Boys of Alabama, David Hasselhoff and Hugh Hefner (voice only) are amusing, but may look pointless considering the film' main target audience.

For all these, however, I enjoyed watching the film with its great effects, colorful designs and some funny jokes. Maybe this is not an instant classic, but is still an entertaining family picture.",1314144000,,1669,4.890459363957597

And David Hasselhoff? Anyone who wants to make a good movie will not have him in it. I would've given this piece of junk negative stars if I could.",1312243200,4,502,4.185567010309279
4372616,3,B004G5Z0DW,"Short attention span summary:

1. E.B. (voice of Russell Brand) is a slacker-bunny who's next in line for the Easter Bunny job.

2. Fred O'Hare (James Marsden) is a slacker-dude who's last in line for any job at all.

3. E.B. flees the Easter factory (on Easter Island of course) to follow his drumming dream.

4. Fred flees the family home to drum up a dream job.

5. Naturally they meet up, and strangely they don't realize that they have a lot in common.

6. Meanwhile, back at Easter Island, a yellow angry bird (voiced by Hank Azaria) has some destructive plans, and Mr. Bunny (voiced by Hugh Laurie) dispatches his elite pink hit squad to find and recover E.B. before Easter.

7. Some funny bits can be found within a rather predictable story-line, made easier by the fact that the movie opens with Fred letting the peep out of the bag.

A great cast and slamming sound-track help this movie along, but under the eggshell that is the wonderful visual experience of the Easter factory lies a half-boiled story-line that never quite adds up to a pile of jelly beans.

4372619,3,B004G5Z0DW,"(Written by the teenager in residence)

Upon first hearing of Hop, I had high hopes for it. Although the premise - holiday figure gets injured in accident, everyman has to replace him - has been done before, one detail caught my eye - ""From the people who brought you Despicable Me"". Despicable Me is one of my favorite modern-day animated films, with interesting (and entertaining) characters, solid plotting, and a good dose of heart. Naturally, I expected this movie to be on the same level, or at least have some solid execution. It delivered in the entertainment value, but it left a lot to be desired.

Story: 7/10 - As mentioned, the premise combines several cliches - kid has legacy, kid wants to be something else, kid runs away from home, is in danger of having his birthright or whatever stolen by some other guy if he doesn't make it back home before a certain date. It also has the standard everyman who can't hold a job, but has his life changed when he accidentally injures, maims, or even kills a holiday figure (in this case it's the former) and eventually finds his place in the world. It's been done a million times, and the fact that said holiday figure is a talking CGI animal and the humans are all in live-action draws parallels to Alvin and the Chipmunks.

Depth: 4/10 - Now, a cliched premise is not a bad thing, and some works have managed to excel despite (or because of) their uses of cliches (like BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger), although mileage varies. A bungled execution, however, is certainly not good. The interactions between the human protagonist(Fred o'Hare) and the rabbit (E.B.) don't have much of an emotional impact - it's same old, same old. There are some interesting plot points that never get explored further - E.B. wants to be a drummer, rather than the Easter Bunny, but we're never really given a clear reason why (except for ""touring the world"", but his father (the incumbent Easter Bunny) points out that easter bunnies go all over the world, too). The Pink Berets, sent to bring E.B. back home, aren't developed, don't have a single line of dialogue, and are generally incompetent (they mistake a Butterball for a bunny by the end). And the fact that the easter bunnies live on Easter Island could have been used for some interesting, if far-fetched, plot points - maybe the Moai are actually sentient guardians of the factory where the Easter Bunnies make their candy? But no - all of these plots are wasted.

Characters: 5/10 - Most of these characters are underdeveloped and underused throughout the movie. For example, Fred fits squarely into the archetype of ""beleagured slacker with a good heart"", and doesn't show much depth except for his desire to be the Easter Bunny. To his credit, he does show that he's willing to work for his goals, but that's really it. The main villain, Carlos, is an obvious bad guy with cliched motives, but he is the most sympathetic character - considering how big of a jerk the Easter Bunny is when Carlos tries to show that he can be competent, it's easy to understand why he's so ticked off. The sad thing, though, is that we never see that Carlos could be a good easter bunny - indeed, when he takes over, he almost ruins the holiday experience for non-birds. All of the human characters except for Fred and David Hasselhoff (don't ask) are underutilized as well - his older sister, Sam, is used to give him a job interview that E.B. fumbles for him and a lecture on responsibility, but doesn't really do anything else. His younger sister, Alex, acts like a jerk and hassles Fred during a family dinner, but ends up upstaged and humiliated by a ""ventriloquism"" act that comes across as disproportionate karma. The whole scene doesn't have that much of an impact on the main plot, either, except for straining Fred's realtionship with his family even further. And don't get me started on the Pink Berets - seriously, don't.

Entertainment: 8/10 - Despite these glaring flaws, Hop proves to be entertaining on the first go-through regardless. It's only when examined with a keen eye that the fridge logic sets in. The jokes are relatively funny, the animation is fluid and avoids uncanny valley, and the soundtrack is decent, although not magnificent. The MST3K mantra - ""It's only a movie, I should really relax"" - applies in full here, but it still manages to be a nice diversion overall.

Overall: 24/40 - Like I said, there are many flaws and cliches used in this movie. There are a lot of wasted plots and potential characterization gone down the drain, but it still manages to be a nice experience on the first go-through. My recommendation would be to see it once, laugh a lot, and don't think too much about it. For the kiddies, take them to see ""Rango"" - a vastly superior animated experience - or watch ""Despicable Me"" again before you go see this. It's a good time on the first go-through, but overall, it's just... meh.",1305936000,5,4920,4.688657407407407
4372620,5,B004G5Z0DW,"So when I saw the trailer for this movie I was impressed by how E.B. was playing the drums and that pretty much interested me into seeing the movie and so I did. I gotta admit this movie was pretty good, alot of funny humor within, music, and a holiday still focused on. Sure the plot was fairly similar to Alvin & The Chipmunks, but thats because the director who made that, made this, and its an improved version of A&TC cause there's only one character to adore instead of 3, more funnier scenes, and real music that you will enjoy instead of extremely high pitched vocals that make your ears pop!(A&TC). The reason why this movie has critical reviews is because this movie is targeted at younger viewers, all those critics who rated this bad have absolutely no sense of humor! Its a great family flick kids will enjoy, believe me when I was in the theater it was packed with kids!",1305158400,5,884,4.429447852760736

Sadly, he does not achieve said dream and becomes a ""co-Easter bunny"". A movie with absolutely no depth, or meaning. Not even my seven year old sister found this funny. Oh yeah, and I only gave it one star cause I had to put in a rating.",1304899200,9,372,4.109589041095891
4372622,4,B004G5Z0DW,"With films like Yogi Bear, Alvin & The Chipmunks, Scooby Doo, Marmaduke and worst of all Garfield littering the cinescape with dreadful dreck involving live action people and computer animated cartoon animals, I wasn't exactly jumping for joy when I saw the trailers for Hop. In place of a nonsensical farce filled with more rubbish than a fleet of garbage trucks, in Hop we are treated to a whimsical tale with positive messages and loads of good old fashioned fantasy style fun. Anyone who grew up watching Rankin Bass holiday specials on TV will appreciate the classic themes beautifully updated for the modern day in Hop. Usually it works to advantage, occasionally it falls short.

The visual landscape and the animation of the characters is startlingly realitic and very quickly has you feeling you're just watching a regular movie where animals really do talk and there really is a secret lair of the easter bunny.

Like some other reviewers noted, there is a definite Willy Wonka meets christmas with Santa theme going here, and that's what really works. Visiting the people of the world only once a year and mastermminding the secrecy of the operation, many times the characters seem bogged down with non-information about the world inhabited by people, and thats just classic comedy perfection.

There are some weak points scattered about, but somehow, overall in the scheme of the movie, they are momentary and forgotten immediately as EB, our main character, immediately after a shortcoming does something else heartwarming to endear you to him and his situation.

When I emerged from the theater, I felt as though I saw a very substantial film, quite a task in an animated holiday kids movie, and one that involves Easter, a holiday not usually covered by cinema in terms of kids fare. What holiday can they take on next? I really don't care as long as the result is of the high quality that Hop exhits throughout. If you want a live action animated movie with real substance, hop on over and see Hop.",1303948800,54,2014,4.862973760932944
4372623,3,B004G5Z0DW,"This is one of those movies where the trailers (coming attractions) get you to want to see the movie, and then once you've sat through the movie you realize that you saw all the best stuff in the trailers.

The visuals are first rate.  The Easter Factory is awesome.  The bunnies are adorable, and the ""Pink Berets"" were one of a number of great ideas.

But the bottom line is that after the movie while we were walking out of the theater I asked my two boys -- age 10 and 8 -- to rate it on a scale of 1 for the worst and 10 for the best, and they each gave it a 5.

In fact, the 8 year old just walked up to my computer screen and thought I was buying the movie.  I asked him if he's ever want to see it again, and he said ""no"".  The real irony here is that buying the movie would have cost about half of what it costs to get an adult and two kids to see a movie in the theater these days where I live.

So you've got great visuals, cutting-edgs CGI cuteness everywhere, and some fun ideas, but you've allow got shallow characters and a very contrived story whose writers could not conceive a way for the Easter Bunny to visit all the children of the world without copying Santa Clause, even though the bunnies have a globe spanning ultra high-speed tunnel network that can get them anywhere on Earth in seconds.

Oh, and this is one of those movies where they give away the ending at the beginning and then use the movie to show you ""how it all went down"".  Wow, nothing like knowing how the movie will end right from the get go.  Brilliant.

This movie is like one of those hollow chocolate Easter bunnies that you got when you were a kid not realizing that they were hollow.  You think you've really got somethng awesome, you unwrap it, and then you bite in and it caves in and you realize that hype and the reality can be very different.  It's maybe worth watching later when you're just desperate for a way to pass time with the kids, but I wouldn't pay good money to own it and store it for years.",1303603200,,2005,4.120822622107969
4372624,3,B004G5Z0DW,"I had to pick something to see at the theatre when the family decided to go. There weren't many choices so I ended up seeing this one. The children in the theatre  liked it. So If you're looking to take the kids  that area is pretty much covered. If you're looking for something you might like as well there will be a problem. The film itself is mediocre and extremely predictable.

Eb, the future ""Easter Bunny"" enjoys a great life on Easter island (The actual location) he is very close to his father , the current Easter Bunny who  oversees the factory for easter baskets and their contents. The latter is run by chicks.  From a very young age shows he quite talented at drumming. It isn't long before he decides he wants it to be his career. His father  deems this dream ridiculous and thus EB leaves Easter Island and eventually meets Fred O Hare, a man who hasn't worked in over a year and keeps botching every job interview he gets.

You can guess what happens from there and I'm certain you'll get it right.

There is nothing unique or remotely appealing in this film It's just one of the things  that can only be described as ""Cute""
Some parts I feel  ccan be described as cheesy simply because of the cast. It seems they just threw together a medley of has-beens and rising groups. David Hasslehoff makes an appearance as well the Blind Boys of Alabama.

I was also a little irked by the stereotypical implications of the voices. The chicks speak with a hispanic accent and are the primary workers in the factory. When EB is around the Blind Boys (An african American group of blind men)  he speaks  (Or tries to.) In a stereotypical dialect. The film could have done without that.

So if you like the predictable or just need something to take the kids to this'll be ok. emphasis on ""OK""",1303516800,,1798,4.442073170731708

In the beginning it has a bit of Willy Wonka feel to it, while more to the end, it leans more to Santa. But it's all Easter-bunny power (sorry for the chicks). I liked it better at the beginning, and the middle. Quite some surprise-jokes there. But somewhere before the end, I get the feeling, the makers suddenly realize they need to bring to movie to an end. From that point on everything gets very rushed and quick-paced and to me the movie looses some of it's magic at that point. But still we had lots of fun.
