8067673,1,B0009VUMF8,"As previously posted

The cover and back of the packing show the 1981 Legend of the Lone Ranger film. THIS IS NOT IT.
The write up when I purchased this DVD was what was on the back cover not what was in the DVD holder.
The Movie description on the back cover is NOT what this movie is.
It's the first three episodes of the tv series not the movie.

Don't waste your money!",1275436800,,373,4.027027027027027
8067674,2,B0009VUMF8,"The cover and back of the packing show the 1981 Legend of the Lone Ranger and a Zorro film. The Lone Ranger is the 1952 black and white (not even  colour version ) of the first three episodes of the tv series not the movie, and the 1952 Zorro is a 1976 Zorro film with poor sound. The Lone Ranger shows were around 1hr and 8 minutes not even the 1hr 38 minutes advertised on the back. The write up when I purchased this DVD was what was on the back cover not what was in the DVD holder.",1167004800,12,486,3.909090909090909
8067675,2,B0009VUMF8,"As much as I am a fan of the Lone Ranger - this is not the film I expected - the cover picture leads you to believe this is the Klinton Spilsbury version from the 80's - its not - its just the first 3 episodes of the Clayton Moore TV show.  Which is fine if you are looking for the Clayton Moore Lone Ranger.

As for the Zorro film - that is 90 minutes of my life wasted.  I had hoped for one of the older black and white swashbuckling hero versions - this is at best a B-grade story that way overplays mediocre action.  The sound is horrible, and the storyline is confusing even if you know the Zorro storyline.

I bought my copy at a dollar store - for a dollar - that is the most this set is worth.",1142294400,20,701,3.874125874125874
