the fashion world by using her imagination and changed the way we dress forever.  Her name is still synonomous with Haute Couture

8306338,5,B001GO1XOG,"To learn and examine Chanel the person and Chanel the designer helps one to appreciate all the more the classic silhouettes of today's fashion designers and what they are striving to improve upon...like the ""little black dress"".  Through this retro documentary, today's fashion efforts to improve upon what Chanel envisioned for women's fashions, one only needs to examine Chanel the woman, then Chanel the designer, again and again, to truly appreciate what Chanel was able to accomplish in fashion history and still be influential today. Chanel and her fashion vision really helped to elevate both yesterday's and today's fashion and style directions.  This historical retrospective can be and should be studied, viewed and learned from beginning to end, especially if you are aspiring to become tomorrow's fashion designer.

To know the woman is to know her cloths and vice versa.",1269043200,10,883,5.292857142857143
8306339,5,B001GO1XOG,"This is an excellent bio of Coco Chanel!! To have come as far as she did as the fashion house with an indelible name, is extraordinary in an era when women were little more than chattel. The interviews with Coco in her latter years gives one a glimpse as to the persona that persisted through privation and also came back after a long absence. I appreciate that Karl Lagerfeld had preserved many of then drawings of Chanel fashions during her era. I recommend this film to anyone.",1268784000,18,480,4.528735632183908
8306340,5,B001GO1XOG,"This film is a documentary which  made over 20 years ago. It is an ideal companion to the recent TV /Lifetime and French language film ""Coco"" about the early years of Coco Chanel, recently released.  This documentary shows actual interviews and actual footage of Coco and snippets of her era, which I found fascinating. It provides much real life information that Hollywood left out of their versions.
Also included are man interviews with Karl Lagerfeld when he first took over the Chanel firm provide his insight about her impact on the fashion world.

This is one of the only factual film resources available to augment the many books published about Coco.  Very worthwhile and ideal for the  student or layment interested in this iconic figure.",1266192000,26,748,4.952
8306341,5,B001GO1XOG,"This biography of Chanel and history of fashion was filmed in 1988 with a young Karl Lagerfeld.  Karl Lagerfeld is interviewed throughout as this was created a few years after he took over the House of Chanel.

The film is done in fashion biography documentary style with a combination of black & white and color movies, photos and illustrations.  The film is lovingly narrated by Diane Glick.

The most wonderful part of the film is watching Chanel in interviews explain her philosophy in life and fashion. You can see that she was always focused, always a sharp business woman and always aware of her place in life and history.

Whether you are a Chanel devotee, fashionista or fashion historian, this film is worth every penny.",1258675200,80,730,4.808
