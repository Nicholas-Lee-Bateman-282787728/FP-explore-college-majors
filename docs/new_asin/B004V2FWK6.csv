There have been 1000s of Hindi Movies about family life with Jeetendra, Mithun and Rajesh Khanna being the regulars. Dariya Dil is one of the Best Family Drama's around. Its a simple story of a father who has a special bond for giving charity to the poor gets miss treated two of his sons. Govinda plays the Good son who respects his father. The other 2 sons are lazy and ill mannered. They treat their parents in a bizarre way and eventually kick them out of the house. Govinda does a good job in the role. Kimi Katkar is one of Bollywood's most annoying actresses, you'll know why if you see her films. It is Kader Khan who delivers a powerhouse performance as the struggling father. We can see a similar role in the Hit Amitabh movie Baghban. Baghban had a better finish where the father doesn't forgive the sons. Dariya Dil is a good family movie.",1305763200,,967,4.468926553672317
