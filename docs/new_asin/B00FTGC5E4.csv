8618554,4,B00FTGC5E4,"This is an account of an unusual quest embarked upon by Iranian composer Nader Mashayekyi after receiving a request for him to lead the Tehran Symphony Orchestra in 2005. He accepted this offer, leaving for Iran with only a suitcase and minimal belongings.

His meeting with his father early on was not over-encouraging as his father clearly thought this was a venture taken against too many odds. One has to have sympathy with this view. Nader Mashayekhi himself comments that the Iranian people do not have an in-built emotional response to musical sounds, and what little there might have been in the past has now been lessened under the latest regime.

His involvement with a range of mostly young players focuses on Mahler whom he describes to them as a composer prepared to take on considerable opposition to his ideas. This seems rather a dangerous political observation in the context of Iran and likely to put the players and himself in a dangerous position. The documented form of tuition mostly involves close proximity with only a few players at a time, and once more, one fears for the potential consequences of such individual tuition. These immediate consequencies do not seem to materialise as shown by the film.

The musical emphasis upon Mahler focuses on the 4th movement of the second symphony with its text highlighting the pain of mankind and its need for help. Once more this seems to underline a potentially dangerous political viewpoint in the circumstances.

A purely musical consideration from such an emphasis on this particular extract is the total concentration on music of a particularly slow pace. This is possibly the consequence of the obviously limited technical performing skills of the players who are clearly incapable of tackling the other movements of the symphony. However, as an example of Western music this is an unfortunate choice as it gives the idea that such music is predominately slow and that it carries text with a verbal message. Neither of these are true or typical of course but how are the Iranian players to know?

The music then leaves Mahler and becomes more abstract with an emphasis on more modern idioms and ideas such as those typified by John Cage for example. These are allied with Iranian patterns of sound as a form of cross-over. Once more the pace is predominately slow.

The images of Iran in both urban and non-urban environments only serve to forcibly illustrate the huge gulf between what is being attempted and the reality as portrayed. Not surprisingly therefore the project falters and Mashayekhi returns to Europe on his own.

Towards the end of the film he manages to get a group of the Iranian players to leave Iran by plane in order to participate in a musical performance of a similar type as described above. Visas are pointedly illustrated with the implied accompanying difficulties.

While one might applaud Nader Mashayekhi for such a venture, it seems that it is essentially unlikely to thrive as a practical concept and so it turns out. A brave, possibly foolhardy, attempt at cross- cultural communication where the odds were too highly weighed against likely success. The sincerity of Mashayekhi is not in doubt but his very sincerity also prohibited him from being more outwardly enthusiastic and inspiring to his young charges. One hopes that they were able to meet with more outwardly enthusiastic manifestations of Western music during their visit. There is no conclusion to suggest whether they stayed or returned or to what happened next.

This is an unusual film of an unusual venture. The rating is based on the technical quality of the film rather than its content as it is so difficult to ascertain its potential audience in any meaningful way. This review is simply a summary of the film's contents as a guide to its possible appeal.",1392595200,,3833,4.9394409937888195
