8353193,5,B0026MIOQ2,"I was searching for a Spanish version of ""A Christmas Carol"" and I found this.  It is truly a gem.  A council of angels has passed judgment on the failed state of humanity, but one young man gets a chance to save the world by showing - and learning for himself - what goodness truly is.  This movie is very well done and is actually not  sickeningly sweet like most American holiday movies.  Spanish only, no subtitles, which makes it great for those who want to practice their comprehension.

This movie deserves a place as an annual Christmas favorite.  The Spanish TV stations should pick it up and show it every year.",1291075200,,621,4.491071428571429
