8320301,3,B001M1GB04,"I bought this movie after reading the true story of this debate team.  I should have known the ""PG13"" rating would mean it's not acceptable for my grandchildren, which is really sad since this is an excellent example of serious students' success beyond anyone's wildest dreams.",1386806400,,277,5.021739130434782
8320302,5,B001M1GB04,"I wanted my undergraduate students to experience writing a review, so based on their preferences we watched The Great Debaters. When they turned in that assignment, they all wanted to know the ""true"" story. So I purchased The Real Great Debaters for them to watch in class. They were very impressed with the truth, and very forgiving with the liberties taken in Hollywood's ""factionalized"" version. However, they did question why it had to be Harvard in Denzel Washington's version. ""Wasn't the truth good enough?"" one of them asked.

I would recommend watching The Real Great Debaters whenever anyone watches The Great Debaters. Doing that provides the best of both worlds.",1268524800,2,674,5.127272727272727

8320304,5,B001M1GB04,"I recently came across this DVD when looking to purchase ""The Great Debaters"" movie.  I initially expressed interest in this DVD when I understood that Nate Parker (who played Henry Lowe, who was modeled after Wiley College debater Henry Heights) was interviewed for the documentary.  But the documentary doesn't disappoint in ANY way:  you have testimony from the Wiley College debate students who were still living at the time that this DVD was made, the testimony of the present debate team at Wiley College, the family members of those who'd passed on who were a part of such a history-making event, and the future of Wiley College.  This is a must-have for anyone who's a black history enthusiast like me.",1245801600,4,710,4.891666666666667
8320305,5,B001M1GB04,"THIS DOCUMENTRY WAS EVEN MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FILM.
IT GIVES THE STORY OF THE REAL DEBATERS FROM WHICH THE FILM WAS INSPIRED.
THE HISTORICAL ARCHIVAL FILM OF HISTORICAL BLACK COLLEGES IS TRULY PRICELESS. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYBODY REMOTELY INTRESTED IN BLACK HISTORY!!",1242432000,9,275,5.0
8320306,5,B001M1GB04,"Once again, AMS Pictures creates another compelling and inspiring documentary. Based on the Hollywood movie, this film tells the true story of the great debaters, including how these incredible men and women went on to make huge changes in the world. This is a story that is as relevant and riveting today as it was then.",1229299200,8,321,4.75
