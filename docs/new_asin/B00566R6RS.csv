8459259,4,B00566R6RS,"Okay, it's Korean, so it doesn't always make sense, but this is nevertheless a cleverly constructed and---for me--riveting film. The plot could really be made a lot clearer but there could be Korean stuff I'm missing.  Don-kung Yang is competent as a nerdy computer whiz, while Seong-Su Kim is spectacularly smooth and scary as an all-controlling Insane Bad Guy Super Villain.  Ji-min Yung is the slinky gorgeous stuff of every boy's dreams, with a strolling walk that stops traffic.

This was very entertaining and held my attention as I waited for ""John"" to reveal the big secret and the big deal. I felt rewarded, even with an ending twist that was off the wall bizarre and not quite clear. Was this a play within the play--a last minute decision--or was the entire play somehow engineered by the individual we last see on screen? I'll leave that to you to decide.

I do tend to think the ""nerd"" engineered Everything because at the end we see what's hidden in the fishtank (spoliler alert!) but I won't delineate on that....

This would make a terrific re-make in maybe Japan, or Hong Kong, where plots are more carefully crafted. In the US I'm sure it would be extremely annoying and full of crappy US actors. French films become obscure at times, but Spanish ones (Spain) stay fairly well on track at times. I would love to see this plot reworked and smoother out; it would be really cool.

See this film. For some unknown reason, I can hardly put it out of my mind---I think because it has such Vast potential for Story....",1374537600,,1530,4.648148148148148
8459260,4,B00566R6RS,"Kyong-ho is a lonely IT guy. He spends his days working in bank security and spends his evenings talking to his action figure collection and battling kids in online games. That is until he meets John. John's a mastermind criminal who manipulates Kyong-ho into helping his with his plan to withdraw a small amount of money from every bank account in Korea.
I did find myself getting pretty confused during this film, but I hang in there expecting something to make sense. I was right to. By the end, every single speck of confusion was gone. Luckily, the 90 minutes this ran was the perfect length. Any longer and they might have had to add more obscure characters, like the kid in a wheelchair who talks with a robot man's voice (don't worry, it makes sense when you watch it). If you have the patience, definitely give this a watch. If you don't have the patience, you're missing out.",1357689600,,885,4.572327044025157
