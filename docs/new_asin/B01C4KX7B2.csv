In the late 1970's banking was a snooze until a man changed banking investments with mortgage bonds (bundled mortgages). It all came crashing down in 2008 and created a world-wide depression. Some foresaw this by looking at the facts. A man is hired to investigate the top twenty mortgage bonds. There is a meeting. One investor says mortgage-backed bonds are very risky; when interest rates go up there will be defaults that caused the fund to go bankrupt. These AAA rated bonds were really risky. Mark talks to his wife then takes a cab. He wants to buy a credit-default swap to profit when the mortgage bonds fail. But he wants a guarantee the bank will pay off. He will buy $100 million worth! He visits other banks to make similar deals; a total of $1.3 billion! But his company balks at this. Another man wants to short mortgage bonds.

Modern mortgage bonds are made up of layers of tranches (varying grades from AAA-AA-A-BBB-BB-B ratings). When the default rate goes up the bonds lose value. A credit-default swap can generate ten or twenty to one returns. A bank takes low-rated bonds and puts them into a CDO (collateralized debt obligation). The banks don't pay attention to what they're selling. Those banks are greedy in their loans (credit cards, student loans, etc.), An ISDA Agreement lets an investor make high level trades. They visit a housing development in Miami and learn the facts. Mortgage frauds are up, wages are level. The second quarter of 2007 will see interest rates rise (and increase mortgage costs). One man asks for his money back. They visit housing and learn about Adjustable-Rate Mortgages. Houses are sold without verifying the income of the buyers. Mark talks to the owner of five houses and a condo. He decides to buy more credit-default swaps. They call Ben Rickert to get his help in getting an ISDA; he agrees.

The news tells of rising mortgage delinquencies. But ratings are up! Standard & Poors give AAA ratings to those bond funds, they are sold for fees. Self-interest, they lose nothing this way. Are the banks involved in a fraud? There is a meeting in Las Vegas for the American Securitization Forum. Will sub-prime losses stop? They go to a shooting gallery; its on their expense account. The FTC doesnt investigate, their budget was cut! The bonds aren't going down, its a fraudulent system. Or are they mistaken? They bet against the American economy. When unemployment goes up by 1% then 40,000 Americans die! There are synthetic CDOs made up from CDOs. They are explained like a side bet. Michael restricts withdrawals from the fund. In March 2007 the meltdown begins. Bear Stearns Liquidates Hedge Funds After Massive Subprime Mortgage Losses says a news report [they went bankrupt]. Bad bonds are being unloaded on unsuspecting customers.

Will the media print this? Its happening. How bad is this? Should they sell now? No. Jared has a check for $47 million. There is a meeting, Mark Baum speaks about what happened. An era of fraud caused the problems. Average people will pay for this. The stock of Bear Stearns dropped 38%! Next Countrywide Mortgage, Lehman Brothers! Employees leave with their personal effects. Do not talk to the press! People lost jobs and homes. Michael J. Burry closed down his fund. It had a 48% return. There will be a bailout of banks too big to fail. The banks took the money, paid themselves well, and blamed the problems on immigrants and poor people. After the collapse five trillion dollars in pension money, real estate value, 401K plans, savings, and bonds disappeared. Eight million people lost their jobs, six million people lost their homes - just in the USA. Could the ratings agencies be sued? No. The government was not interested in the cause of the collapse. In 2015 large banks began selling billions in renamed CDOs.

This was the greatest fraud in US history. The Corporate Media censored or minimized the story. What will they do next? This is a very good drama with an educational lesson. But the story and direction make it hard to follow. If you don't read the business pages or know about this historic fraud it will seem like a jigsaw puzzle. The Great Depression of the 1920s-1930s was caused by swindling people by selling worthless bonds. The New Deal passed the Glass-Steagal Act to control investment banking. In 2000 a corrupt US Supreme Court intervened in the election to choose George W. Bush as President. A Republican Congress abolished the Glass-Steagal Act. Then Wall Street began a series of swindles by using mortgages that were bought and bundled into securities. The moral hazard was in giving them AAA ratings when they were composed of risky mortgages.

The passage of NAFTA shipped good-paying jobs overseas, people sought better returns on their money. The past decades made most people trust Wall Street, few understood the risks of Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. Most people spent too much time on entertainment, show business, etc. These distractions have their costs, but culture is involved with dumbing down people the better to fool them. The meltdown in value, or swindle, was made worse by the increase in unemployment and loss of jobs. This affected taxes and funds for Social Security and Medicare. Can America elect a President and Congress who are not flunkies of Wall Street? I hope so.
