8557235,1,B00ARWXERM,"This movie is either a satire of bad movies or one of the worst movies ever made.
If the video quality was better it was be more watchable.
It looks like it was copied of of a laser disk.
If you enjoy over done satire you will enjoy this movie. It doesn't play well on large screens as the pixelation becomes very obvious",1241308800,,321,4.111111111111111
8557236,5,B00ARWXERM,"Ok. This is a wonderful terrible movie. Porn fans will think the star of this movie looks like Ron Jeremy. Anyway, this film falls apart so terrible at the end you can tell that there wasn't any money at the end of the production. Which leads to lots of running around with ridiculous chases. An alien wins a trip to the horniest place in the universe, which happens to be in the northeast, and stirs up trouble with humans who want to kill him. His enemies include: a terribly cast Italian mob crew and a band of Jewish rednecks. The Jewish rednecks are worth the purchase alone. Anyway, if you like bad movies, you will love this.",998870400,4,632,4.410256410256411
