this is the bbc version of what was a joint production between bbc and kcet los angeles.  it is substantially different from what you might have seen on pbs or the pbs-released vhs tapes.  for one thing, it is 5 1/2 hours vs the 8 hour kcet version.  this is what was broadcast on bbc, not what was broadcast on pbs.  i know because i have both sets.  this one is good enough, but more heavily edited.  it is also a region 2/PAL disc.  if you don't know what that means, look it up on wiki.  and if you're waiting for a region 1 dvd release, it won't happen in anyone's lifetime.  i got this straight from a man at kcet who worked on the original production.",1448668800,,670,4.131782945736434
