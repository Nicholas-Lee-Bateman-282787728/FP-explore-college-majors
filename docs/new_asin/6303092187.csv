Madonna has never made anything this bad...It's about on the level of Shanghai Surprise. No wonder the price is so low. They should pay people to take this from them instead.

557570,4,6303092187,"After the critical panning of the majority of Madonna's films it is easy to dismiss this seemingly insignificant little indie as nothing more than another one of her mistakes or attempts to shock. However, unlike the truly awful Body Of Evidence Dangerous Game does feature a strong storyline and great performances both from Madonna and Harvey Keitel.
Madonna looks more stunning than ever as Sarah Jennings the tragic talentless actress who is referred to by Keitel as ""The womanwho can't act"". The role is probably not unlike Madonna herself in some ways, although she definately is not talentless, as she endures much abuse in the film as was rumoured she experienced in the late 80's while married to Sean Penn. I suspect this is probably so as such an emotionally raw performance could not be achieved with some drawing and delving into personal experience.
Dangerous Game proves without doubt that the Material girl can act and it is just a shame that the rest of the movie does not hold up to her incredible performance. Abel Ferrara direction is not at it's best and the editing is also very shoddy. The film also features lashings of sex, swearing, violence and rape and this is likely to offend many viewers but if you can cope with that then the movie is a must see not just for Madonna fans but also for anyone who enjoys a good unpredictable thriller. Go rent it!!! Now come on you know you want to!",992217600,17,1413,4.678714859437751
557571,3,6303092187,"After several failed attempts at acting in starring roles that were all critical/box office duds, Madonna decided to pick herself up by her bra straps and give a real, intense acting performance. True Madonna has shown some acting skill in the past with such roles as trampy free spirit Susan in ""Desperately Seeking Susan"", frisky baseball player ""All The Way"" Mae Mordabito in ""A League Of Their Own"" and the sexy, complicated chauntesse Breathless Mahoney in ""Dick Tracy"" but all of those roles were supporting and Madonna has proven herself adept at doing her best work when the pressure isn't on her to deliver the goods. Leading roles in SHANGHAI SURPRISE, WHO'S THAT GIRL?, BODY OF EVIDENCE and THE NEXT BEST THING, have all ended in catastrophe damaging Madonna's ever shaky movie career each time. But after the debacle of Body of Evidence, the underappreciated EROTICA album and the mega-selling but shame inducing SEX book, Madonna's career was at an all time nadir and she was basically pronounced dead as a doorknob by all her critics and detractors. With DANGEROUS GAME, Madonna gave her all in an intense, raw, from the gut performance which was definently overlooked by the public. As Sarah Jennings, TV starlet given the lead role in a dark, moody art film about the disintegration of a marriage, Madonna shines in a role that truly displays her talents. As Claire, Madonna also revealed a vulnerable and haunting side to her persona, which stays with any viewer of the movie long after the credits roll. You remember the rumors of domestic abuse that swirled around Madonna's 80's marriage to bad boy actor Sean Penn and you wonder if she was reliving her traumas through Claire. Who knows, but Madonna is genuine and real and has feelings and emotions and displays them wonderfully. The film however didn't really stand up as well as Madonna's performance but it will forever be remembered as the movie that gave Madonna some of her acting credibility.

557573,3,6303092187,"Abel Ferrara's meditation on life imitating art (and vice versa) is one of his weaker films, but didn't deserve the critical loogies it got. Harvey Keitel is Eddie Israel, a filmmaker very similar to Ferrara. (His wife is  played by Ferrara's wife Nancy.) Eddie is directing a psychodrama starring  two actors who hate each other (Madonna and James Russo) playing a couple  falling apart. Meanwhile, Eddie sleeps with Madonna (wonder if Abel did,  too?) and wrecks his own marriage (wonder if...ah, never mind). It takes a  very gutsy filmmaker to direct a scene in which his onscreen surrogate  confesses to his wife's onscreen surrogate (who is also PLAYED by his wife)  that he's had lots of on-set affairs.
Is any of it interesting? Sure. It  offers insight into how directors get edgy performances out of actors --  and, more specifically, how Ferrara gets them. There's some wit in the  casting of Keitel as the Ferrara figure -- he gets to show us what Ferrara  probably put him through on ""Bad Lieutenant."" Among the movie's  triumphs is that Madonna actually wakes up and gives a solid, believable  performance, both as Claire the religious convert in Eddie's film and as  Sarah the traumatized actress in Ferrara's film. Some would say she's just  playing herself either way -- which I think is part of Ferrara's point:  Great acting requires you to play yourself, to dig out the parts of  yourself you're least proud of and lay them bare.
All that said, this is  a good film-buff movie, but it's too smitten with its own fancy intricacy.  Eventually even the most confrontational scenes (Eddie insulting Sarah  off-camera to provoke her into reading her lines with the appropriate  venom; Russo getting carried away and doing everything in the script for  real) seem like movie-magazine clichs. I kept expecting Ferrara to step  into the frame and coach Keitel on how to play him. Not Ferrara's best, but  even Ferrara at his worst is generally more interesting than most directors  at their bland best.",964828800,2,2014,4.905044510385757

557741,4,6303092187,"The movie's plot on the surface is the making of a movie, a movie whose characters are in crisis.  In reality, I believe, 'Dangerous Game' wants to represent the chaos of excess, excess in pleasure and caprice, such that pleasure is no longer pleasing and caprice leads to destruction. The acting of Madonna is not terrible although at times she seems amateurish.  Keitel is great, as he excels in the portrayal of a man in the the throes of nihilism.  But he is suffering because of his deep spiritualism.  Franco is very good as well, as the arrogant and self-indulgent leading man.  This is a dark film as its central preoccupation is spiritual crisis.  This of course means that it is not for everyone but if you are attuned to the spiritual crisis' of our time you might get a sense that the film captures it well.",1376611200,,819,4.537414965986395

557743,3,6303092187,"After having seen Bad Lieutenant from Abel Ferrara, I was rather disappointed in his next work of art. I think Keitel, Russo, & Madonna all did the best they could with this film but overall the film lacks the utter rawness or gritty feel that Ferrara normally supplies with gusto.

Dangerous Game aims to be the gritty, dark drama which will reveal bits & pieces of human heart while attempting to explore human nature. The idea is undoubtedly reasonable & end results should be quite disturbing but the average viewer isn't going to have the patience to sit this one out. Ferrara could've made an excellent film which delves into the evil that lurks within Hollywood but he would've needed a stronger script. Unfortunately, weak scripts are a feat for even the best actors in the industry to pull off. Sadly, the film suffered greatly although it's clearly evident that each cast member does exhibit a great deal of talent.

I did bestow a three star rating to the film because it doesn't lack tension but rather seems unfocused or incohesive. There really isn't a great deal of plot unfortunately but the film does have some powerful scenes including the marital abuse scenes which involve both Russo & Madonna or the scenes where Keitel bullies the male lead in hopes of attaining an edgier performance. Keitel's character even goes on to tell the lead that he doesn't care whether or not it requires less/more drugs to pull it off. Obviously, the Director cares very little for his actors & this brutal portrayal works extremely well.

I also found the whole concept of domestic abuse/violence to be almost eerily haunting & I had to sometimes wonder if the film doesn't mirror the marriage of Madonna & Sean Penn. This vulnerable side of Madonna is one we don't often see on film & I think she crafted a very disturbing character here. It's a shame the editing here is shoddy & Ferrara has done much better directorial work.

Abel Ferrara's meditation on life imitating art (and vice versa) is one of his weaker films but definitely not a complete waste of the viewer's time.",1309219200,,2081,4.740331491712707

557745,3,6303092187,"This review is written by an Abel fan rather than a Madonna fan who I think is unbearable in this movie. She stars as Sarah Jennings an actress who has just landed the lead role in a film called Mother of Mirrors. The film  deals with a married couple who have lived a  lifestyle that includes heavy drug use and sex with multiple partners. The wife has had a spiritual awakening and no longer wants to partake in these sinful activities. She's  hoping that her husband will stop as well and she makes it her mission to save him. The husband doesn't want to hear it and he beats her and taunts her about her new found faith. Directing this film is Eddie Israel (Harvey Keitel). The fact that Keitel is playing a character very similar to director Abel Ferrara is what makes this challenging film worth the effort. The film within a film Mother of Mirrors is similar to Abel's relationship with his ex-wife Nancy. (Nancy even plays Eddie's wife in the movie.) Keitel completely captures Abel complete with the long hair, leather coat, and shades that Ferrara frequently wears.  More than a physical transformation Keitel shows how Abel works with his actors: tender when he needs to be and violent and confrontational when the scene isn't working. This film feels a lot like David Lynch's Inland Empire as what is taking place in the fake movie begins to happen to the actors in their everyday lives. Sarah and Burns (James Russo) the actor playing her husband are actually having an off screen relationship that is becoming more violent as the film shoot progresses. Burns is fueled by heavy drug use which holds up shooting and leads to confrontations between him and Eddie. To further complicate things Eddie has even begun sleeping with Sarah. At times trying to figure out what  is in the movie and what is actually happening can be confusing but mostly it's just annoying. The acting from Madonna and James Russo doesn't help any since they are both so grating and whine constantly. Keitel is the saving grace of the film turning in a fine performance but he alone  can't save things. The film  just plunges deeper and deeper into violence and drug use. What makes this film interesting for Abel fans is in watching this fictionalized account of his life and wondering how much of it is true. There is a scene towards the end of the film where Eddie confesses to Nancy that he has been sleeping with Sarah and the two women missed each other by seconds once when Nancy brought the kids to the  set to pay him a visit. Eddie digs the knife deeper by admitting that Sarah wasn't the first that there have been numerous others on each film he has worked on. Eddie's timing couldn't be better since the time he chooses to get things off his chest happens to be the morning of Nancy's father's funeral. There is another interesting moment where Eddie ridicules Sarah and tells her that without him she would be nothing. He is doing her a favor by casting her in this movie and he is solely responsible for her career taking off. Madonna's production company Maverick produced this film and no doubt contributed money to the film. Abel probably would have had trouble getting this film made were it not for Madonna's participation.  It fails to be as good as Bad Lieutenant even though it takes the same raw approach. Near the end of the film when things are looking hopeless for everyone especially Eddie who is lost in a haze of pills and booze he watches a documentary with director Werner Herzog. Herzog says that even if everyone tells him that the film is a masterpiece he will never be able to justify it to himself and thinks that he should be put in an insane asylum. The ending is certainly a downer as each character meets their dark fate and once Bob Dylan starts singing Blue Moon over the end credits you are glad that this Abel exercise is finally over.",1225065600,2,3867,4.58465991316932
557746,1,6303092187,"You know how Amazon ratings work, so you might understand that I under-rated this mess because the over-all mean was way too high. This is a fascinating film in some ways. It's OK. Keitel and Russo have some unusual acting contexts in which to strut their stuff. It was mean to cast Madonna. She's so awful that the film seems to endorse all the misogynistic violence towards her. Keitel has fun playing Abel Ferrara, perhaps partly in revenge for being Catholicly ""exploited"" in Bad Lieutenant. I remember when I first saw this in the early 90s right after Bad Lieutenant, the intertextual references seemed very graphic. Less so now, but the film, as sub-standard as it is, has to be appreciated as a reaction by both keitel and Ferrara to their impressive collaboration in the aforementioned Zoe Tamerlis-scripted masterpiece. James Russo is excellent with a weakly-scripted part. Whatever happened to Russo? Such a good actor. Nicholas St. John - a frequent collaborator of Ferrara - shows no real talent in this rather enervated Hollywood lampoon. And for that matter, whatever happened to Ferrara?",1217808000,2,1103,5.032786885245901
557747,4,6303092187,"It has become so commonplace for critics (professional and armchair alike) to trash Madonna's film outings that when she does deliver a solid performance, hardly anyone sees or hears about it.  Such is the case with Abel Ferrara's 1993 box office bomb, ""Dangerous Game"".  With a Hollywood backdrop, the film chronicles the agonies and ecstasies (mostly agonies) of a highly volatile and unstable group of people attempting to get a movie completed. As the tensions in the film spill over into the real lives of the actors and director, an atmosphere of escalating insanity develops, turning the movie set into a breeding ground for out-of-control behavior.  Although ""Dangerous Game"" was produced by Madonna's (former) company, Maverick, make no mistake about it, this is an Abel Ferrara film all the way down the line.  It is tough, dark, and uncompromising, which is probably one of the reasons why many people seem to hate this film. Ferrara gained earlier fame with the gritty ""Bad Lieutenant"" and ""Ms. 45"", so a viewer familiar with those films will already have an idea what to expect from ""Dangerous Game"".

Harvey Keitel, as always, does a stellar job.  Here he plays a New York film director, leaving his family to fly to L.A. and make an extremely disturbing film about infidelity and abuse. Keitel, with his frazzled hair and craggy face, realistically portrays the increasing isolation of his character from his wife and son, eventually sinking into despair and disillusionment.  James Russo, as the male lead of the film-within-a-film, excels at playing psychopaths, and here he's walking a fine line as a man descending into a drug and alcohol induced world of paranoid madness.  He's a good actor and gives a convincing performance but his constant carrying-on in this film does get wearying.  Of course, as stated above, the real revelation comes from Madonna's (pardon the pun) immaculate performance as the film's female lead.  She is totally believable in a role that calls for her to exhibit acting chops I never dreamed she had.  Too many bad roles in bad movies have, I believe, led most people to stereotype her as a bad actress, but that's really not true.  She's done good work in other films (""Evita"", Desperately Seeking Susan"", ""Dick Tracy"") but she's won notoriety for ""Swept Away"", ""Who's That Girl?"", ""The Next Best Thing"",and ""Shanghai Surprise"", and that's what most people think about when they hear the words Madonna and movie used in the same sentence.  In ""Dangerous Game"" she's a gorgeous, frightened, overgrown kid trying to act like a tough grownup, and, in the process, becoming an eternal victim. It's easily Madonna's best acting job, and it's obvious that she had to reach deep within herself to deliver a performance of this range and quality.

The film itself is too relentlessly despairing and depressing.  Despite the fine cinematography, there's an underlying ugliness to the film; it's an extremely effective and disturbing film, without ever being enjoyable, and maybe that's what killed it at the box office.  Worth a look if you're aware of what you're getting into.",1215561600,5,3119,5.038910505836576

Madonna delivers a very powerful dramatic performance leagues superior than any other role she has taken.  Put aside your preconceived opinions of the pop princess,and you will be amazed at how she is entrenched in this character.

 I have a suggestion: how about starting out with a sound, well-written screenplay next time?

 You see, the screenplay is your foundation. Just like you can't build a house without a sound foundation,
you shouldn't attempt to make a film without a solid screenplay.
 You, then, only then, build on that with good actors and a director with talent.

How about that for common sense?

I believe it was the late Gene Siskel that called this movie, ""overwrought baloney."" Very true. Since it was too horrible to get released in a movie theater (at least not in the NY area) I had to wait until ""Dangerous Game"" went to video to see it.

But the film has many powerful scenes, and there is almost an unbearable tension on this film set, as Keitel is deliberately screwing around with Russo's character (bullying him, yelling at him), he's having sex with Madonna's character (in order to ""build up"" her character), and Keitel's wife (played by the then Mrs. Ferrara) ends up furious at him when she is told about it.  It's really a very brutal portrayal of the film world.  Not all films are like this obviously, but there are many who probably are.  Abel Ferrara's film has a power to it, and I'm not really sure why.  Madonna actually gives one of her best performances, playing a real person as opposed to just being Madonna, which she usually does.  James Russo sears the screen as usual.  It's a shame he isn't better known, as he is a superlative actor.  And Keitel is, well, Keitel, giving another great performance here.  I really have no idea why critics dumped on this one.

There is a minimal amount of music that wells up at dramatic times, swirling around and distracting us from the film.  The sound editing is excellent as well, getting the sounds of real life just right.
I'm also a fan of films that touch on the making of a film.  I don't think that such movies can help not disclosing a lot about the filmaker of the film that looks at making films.  A bit autobiographical?  One can't help but think so.

Cet effet se rpercutera sur Madonna elle mme, excellente, qui est la rvlation du film. Mais o se trouve la limite entre le film et la ralit ?
Snake Eyes a t salu par la critique mais compltement boud par le public qui n'a pu - peut tre avec raison, s'identifier dans ce film. Il n'en reste pas moins un chef d'uvre injustement mconnu. A dcouvrir !

557820,4,6303092187,"Dangerous Game is a brilliant work of modern cinema and I think it was clever for director Abel Ferrara to use the most contreversial and beautiful woman in the industry, Madonna. She gave a terrific performance as Sarrah Jennings. If you rent this, make sure you see the rated R version instead of the unrated because I bought this movie pre-viewed from a video store (the director's cut) and it was so explicit...there were x2 the violence, sexuality and nudity. This movie needs to be seen by Madonna fans to prove she can act very well.",1050278400,,540,4.635416666666667

Along with the legendary Harvey Keitel, the cast does an amazing job portraying the seedy underbelly of the film industry, using what appears to be old-school method acting.",1428883200,,317,5.115384615384615

7837122,4,6303092187,"As everyone knows, Madonna's success never transferred to the big screen. This film was no different. The difference is that Dangerous Game proves that, under uncertain circumstances, that she really can act.

Director Abel Ferrera, notorious for sleazeploitation flicks, uses the technique of a ""movie within a movie"" with Harvey Keitel playing Eddie Israel, a director working on a film based on a contemptuous marriage. More and more, he uses manipulative tactics to get the most out of his leading lady, Sarah Jennings (Madonna) and Frank Burns (James Russo), only to find that his own personal life is also unravelling right before him. James Russo gives a gunning performance, while Madonna is both shockingly despondent  (and at times, pretty witty) off camera and harrowing on camera.

Though the storyline is far from groundbreaking, Dangerous Game is good on a believable sense of improvisation and is an interesting account of the seedy behind the scenes of Hollywood's underbelly. Worth checking out.",1415232000,,1012,5.3125
7837123,5,6303092187,"This movie was great. I was pleasantly surprised by how good Madonna was in this role, she's usually shaky at best. This time, though she nailed it. That being said this movie is dark, unnecessarily violent, and crass. It's tragic. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I never want to see it again.

Be forewarned what you're getting into, and try to enjoy.",1404432000,,368,4.492537313432836
