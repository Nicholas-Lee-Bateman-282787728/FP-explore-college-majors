8734979,5,B015XC88S0,"I personally watched this movie because of Luke Evans, who plays Adrian. I didn't have high hopes for the film, but I was pleasantly surprised! The dark, thriller-type movie was intriguing and the little bits of humor sprinkled in were great! I would definitely recommend Flutter!",1490659200,,280,5.108695652173913
8734980,4,B015XC88S0,"John (Joe Anderson)  is an out-of-control gambler who will do anything for money. When a mysterious new bookie starts to offer him more unusual, individually tailored bets with bigger payoffs and greater risks, John spirals into a dangerous world of deceit and dare. This is one of those movies that in my mind could go either way. You want to smack this guy for being sucked in but you also have to say go for it. I love British movies and this cast is superb and nothing is really what it would seem to be. Luke Evans and Billy Zane and others make for an interesting movie and just who is this woman and why does she do what she does...could she really be????? .......Hmmmmmm. I loved the acting and loved the flow of this movie. Joe Anderson is quickly becoming a favorite actor and I wish he would do much more, I love Luke Evans, no matter what.",1490227200,,851,4.352201257861635
8734981,3,B015XC88S0,"The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because I think Joe Anderson is hot and that's why I watched it.  (He looks cute in drag too).  Otherwise it's a weird sort-of depressing film, but it might be worth watching just to see Joe Anderson in drag.",1448841600,4,251,4.208333333333333
