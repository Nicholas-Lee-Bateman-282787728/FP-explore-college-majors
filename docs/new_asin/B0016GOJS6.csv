8262401,2,B0016GOJS6,"The cover is like a book..really nice and I love the songs to this movie. This rating is NOT for the film but the fact is..I did not receive any CD inside the pretty movie case.
In the past, I have ordered movies before through Amazon but did not had this problem.",1472515200,,264,4.096153846153846
8262402,3,B0016GOJS6,"The story is that of regular girl who dreams big then hits the big time. It was fine, but in retrospect, having watched it just a few weeks ago, I don't remember a lot of detail so it is really not very memorable. Except one musical number which seemed to drag on way too long, with the female lead posing provocatively in various backdrops and I think I ended up just ""fast forward"" through it. It felt like Aamir Khan was more the secondary figure here rather than the hero and romantic lead, and as a big Aamir Khan fan, I prefer him in the lead romantic role. Regardless, he did capture his character's essence perfectly, as he always does. As opposed to some of Aamir's other works of this time, the picture and sound quality in Rangeela are better than in others like Jawani Zindabad, for example.",1449792000,,803,4.4324324324324325
8262403,5,B0016GOJS6,"great movie, amir khan is brilliant and unarguably the best bollywood actor. So was Urmila !",1447200000,,92,4.8125
8262404,4,B0016GOJS6,"THE HEARTWRENCHING LOVE TRIANGLE - THE STAR, THE HEROINE AND THE TICKET SCALPER

That is what Rangeela is all about. If it seems a bit strange, or absurd, it's not meant to be.

Aamir Khan is Munna, a very poor boy who was befriended by a loving family, and lives in their basement, although he seems to have grown up on the streets, and does the only job he knows how to do, ticket scalping. He is in love with the daughter of the family who he lives with, Mili (Urmila Matondkar). Although he's a street-raised roust-a-bout, he is deeply in love with Mili.

Mili, however, has bigger plans; she wants to be a star. She gets her big break, and is totally star-struck with big star, Raj Kumar (Jackie Shroff).

Now, imagine you're a poor ticket scalper and the woman you have always loved is with the man whose movies you were selling black-market tickets too? Very few movies would dream about exploring such an emotion, but that's what this movie is all about; *those emotions*.

Actually, as entertainment, the movie is a little bit bland; really. It's a bit short (For Bollywood) and is rather uneventful. Yet the acting and emotions they portray is superb.

Shroff is just perfect as an emotionally depraved super-star, and while Mili is star-struck, Urmila Matondkar never lets that spill over into love, and how she represents that is also brilliant acting.

Aamir Khan often plays a poor person who doesn't like 'rich' people. Sometimes you just don't really get it, but here... you just feel for him; everyone's nasty to him and treat's him like a second-class citizen that you really feel for him.

An excellent movie based on feelings, and a perfect partner to ""Deewana Mujh Se Nahin"". I'd rate it four stars.",1369008000,,1720,4.672185430463577
8262405,3,B0016GOJS6,"This movie brought a lot of popularity to its Director, Ram Gopal Verma. It also was a watershed for Music Director, A. R. Rehman, whose original scores were extraordinarily wonderful. Of course, Rehman gained fame internationally too.

The story is about dreams of young people, and those who were young once upon a time. A petite ordinary girl (Urmila Matondkar) dreams of making it big in Bollywood. Jackie Shroff has done justice to his role. Aamir Khan comes up with a stellar performance. This was probably Urmila Matondkar's best performance. It led to many other acting assignments for her. Gulshan Grover has put in a fine little performance too.

The story becomes engaging due to the beautiful songs which have come along at just the right intervals in the narration.

This is basically a love story where the protagonist takes a quantum leap to get his girl.

The music and songs and Aamir Khan make this movie a must see.",1297209600,,934,4.81875
8262406,5,B0016GOJS6,"I originally heard of this movie referred to in another movie (Swades). I then saw references to it on Bollywood sites as much loved with music that is still fondly regarded.
Its music is written by A.R. Rahman who at the time of me writing this had just won a Golden Globe for best soundtrack for 'Slumdog Millionaire' and won elsewhere for the soundtrack of 'Jodha Akbar'.
One of the 3 main stars of Rangeela is Aamir Khan who had the biggest box office success this year in India with Ghajini.
My pre-doubt about getting this DVD was its age. It is from 1995 and the cover looks a bit dated. India of the 1990s seems to often sport hairstyles and clothes of the West's 80s and the colour quality can be dodgy.
In fact those doubts were unfounded - one hairstyle and a couple of outfits aside, this still holds its own.
The dancing by Aamir (who just eats up the screen every time he appears as he is charismatic, attractive and notably a very fine actor) and also Urmila Matondkar as the lively bewitching heroine were extremely good.
There was a lot of dance and good choreography. So often in Bollywood choreographers seem to have to work with a limited repertoire from their actors but the limits were off with these two.
The cinematography was also good with the shooting always well framed and often atmospheric.
Urmilla, who I can't recall seeing before (though I see she has a long list of acting credits and awards), is also an excellent heroine.
The movie is a romantic triangle about an aspiring dancer who wants to make it in movies. She is 'found' by the star of the romantic movie 'Rangeela' (which seems to mean something about colours). The star is a shy, lonely, ageing lothario (played very well by Jackie Shroff)and he falls in love with her.
Will she end up with the successful star or with the penniless friend of her youth who cant admit his love for her in his awkwardness?
The music and dancing are both good- though I think Rahman took many of the numbers and evolved then in 'Taal' (as there are some similarities in sound and style) in 1999 - also recommended. In fact the plot is not dissimilar too!)
Definitely to be recommended.",1232150400,5,2160,4.5268542199488495
