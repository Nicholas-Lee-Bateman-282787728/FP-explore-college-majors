7713198,4,B01DJT73IA,When a movie keeps my attention I rate it better than average. This was entertaining and cute.,1468627200,,94,4.588235294117647
7713199,2,B01DJT73IA,"A movie that just seems to go nowhere...with a main character that you just can't like, yet keeps getting thrown in your face. If you think this is going to be a light hearted comedy like step by step, you're in for a rude awakening.",1467849600,2,233,4.2
7713200,5,B01DJT73IA,"Interesting story line, funny, and good acting all make for a good movie experience.",1467590400,2,84,5.071428571428571
7713201,5,B01DJT73IA,"Saw it at the theatre. Laughed, teared up a bit, laughed again. Lots of US vs Canada humour...with no clear winner or loser. We all have families like this...whether we want to admit it or not...",1467417600,,195,4.444444444444445
7713202,5,B01DJT73IA,"Impressive acting by everyone in this A-list ensemble cast! Making it more real are the sometimes depressing moments, mixed in with a black comedy that always has a few surprises! Christine Lahti and James Brolin play their parts to perfection!

Recommended for 18 and over.",1464652800,2,274,5.088888888888889
8756096,2,B01DJT73IA,"(Major Spoiler Alert) With a cast that includes Jason Ritter (""Jeff""), James Brolin (Josh Brolin's Dad), and Christine Lahti, I definitely had high hopes for ""The Steps,"" which is what made it all so sad, at least for me, and by that, I mean it's so sad that Christine Lahti, one of my all-time favorite actresses, stoops to playing an ex-porn star trying to cover her tracks by being a righteous Canadian-American mom.  This movie isn't half the movie that Lahti's ""Running on Empty"" (1987) was, for which she won the New York Critics' Best Actress Award (for that whole year) and is worlds away from her stint thereafter on TV's ""Chicago Hope,"" for which she was an Emmy winner for Best Actress.  Maybe she was thinking about those much more respected years as an actress in mustering up the tears in her closing scenes for ""The Steps"" (and thinking how the writers had her make fun of her new-and-improved, real-life boobs and had her simulate fellatio in another scene).  In fact, Lahti, as well as the equally likable Ritter and veteran actor Brolin, just wade and lumber aimlessly through a film that had such potential but unfortunately, for them, a substandard and cringe-worthy script that seemed to want to normalize quite provocative adult topics into the cinematic mainstream.  After all, this film basically revolves around the adult-film industry, and I can just imagine how the script was born.  I mean, what were they thinking?  Case in point (besides what has already been mentioned):  Jeff's sister ""Marla"" (Emmanuelle Chriqui) ever so casually discusses with her brother what he masturbates to, and later, Jeff nearly catches his sister performing a sexual act on their new stepbrother!  I wish I was making this stuff up, but I'm not.  For the sake of the actors' careers, hopefully this film will be swept under the rug.  The cast deserved a better script, but I guess a paycheck is a paycheck.  Even the cutesy ending with the pending adoption couldn't salvage it.  Filmed in Parry Sound, Ontario.",1533427200,,2019,4.871345029239766
