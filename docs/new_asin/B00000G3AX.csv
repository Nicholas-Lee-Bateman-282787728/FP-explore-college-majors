1215858,5,B00000G3AX,"This is a wonderful tale of 2 of Walt Disney's ""nine old men"".  I had no idea that the two of them were as close as they were. Shot in a documentary-style, so the viewer has a sense of being their houseguest.  Lifelong friends, who shared the same career, and very similar, and disimilar life experiences. This film is for anyone who truly appreciates classic animation. By the end of the film, I understood their artistic motivations, as well as their struggles and triumphs. I also got some insight into their relationship with Walt(Disney), and how his death affected them.  A truly wonderful film.  I own a copy, and highly recommend it.",995500800,33,641,4.696428571428571
1215859,5,B00000G3AX,"""Frank and Ollie"" is the most fasinating documentary I've ever seen. It takes a look at two of Walt Disney's ""Nine Old Men,"" Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, from their early years at Disney in the 1930s to their everlasting friendship today. I am amazed at how they were able to get the expressions, emotions, and feelings on the characters they animated. They made faces to get the expressions of the characters, acted them out, and asked what the characters were thinking, and why were they feeling that way. This documentary kept a big smile on my face right from the beginning. I love documentaries about movies of all genres, and about the people who make them. This is no exception. It is very informative, affectionate, and heart-warming. This is a real and rare treat for serious animation buffs, or fans of Disney in general.",973209600,11,835,4.76551724137931
1215860,5,B00000G3AX,"Without sounding hackneyed, this cute little story about The Odd Couple of feature animation is at once uplifting, charming and heartwarming. As a cartoonist I found myself inspired, informed and - most importantly -  appreciative of Frank Thomas' and Ollie Johnson's places in our hearts and  memories. Much, much better than a home movie by Frank Thomas' son, Frank  & Ollie is guaranteed to leave you reaching for your pencil with a huge  smile on your face.",925430400,15,461,4.9480519480519485

1215862,5,B00000G3AX,"If you are a fan of Disney animation, this film will be a delightful treat. This is the story of 2 of the best animators Disney had, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston. This movie is about more than just the superb  animation they did on countless Disney classics, it is also about the long  standing friendship they share. It was a thrill to see my favorite  characters come to life with the aid of Ollie and Frank's imagination.  Great, Great film!!.",921369600,3,449,4.506172839506172

1215920,5,B00000G3AX,"Even if you don't know the names Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, chances are you have seen a piece of Disney animation by them at some point in your life. This documentary explores the lives and careers of these two friends who also happened to work together during the Golden Age of Disney animation. The film is interspersed with some of Frank and Ollie's most memorable pieces of Disney animation. With the added perspective from these two fine animators, these scenes become more meaningful to the viewer. The film - much like Frank and Ollie, themselves - is very humorous, warm and charming.",1432512000,3,598,4.815533980582524

1215927,5,B00000G3AX,Awesome movie about two of Disney's great animators.  This movie couldn't have been any better for a autobiography.  Thanks to these animators who have entertained us with their talent may their gift live on thought-out the next generations to enjoy.,1407283200,,250,5.225

1215968,4,B00000G3AX,Frank and Ollie is a wonderful behind the scenes look at what happened during the glory time of Disney animation. Listening and learning from these wonderful men is a treat. You will really like this film.,1399507200,,205,4.722222222222222

1215970,5,B00000G3AX,"As we seek out more understanding and pay credit to the animators & creators supporting the Disney mastery, this production ranks most highly. I couldn't recommend it more. Not just for the Disney fanatic in quest for more historical fact, but for the aspiring animators and artists learning and tweaking their techniques as well. A collector's must have for sure. :o)",1395100800,,368,5.049180327868853
1215971,3,B00000G3AX,"the cover art for this movie made me think it would be such a fun documentary. Not really. It's done very low key, showing lots of footage of the homes that these two animators had right next door to each other. Lots of chances to see these two men talking with each other about those olden days when they used to draw for Disney and lots of chances to see these drawings and they talk about how they came up with ideas and drew characters. All this was very interesting and I came away from this knowing more about the animation process, so that is what I wanted. I don't see why this isn't free through Prime Instant Video, though! I don't see how it is worth 3$ to watch it. I would have given it 4, maybe 5 stars had it been free through Prime.",1389916800,,748,4.13013698630137
1215972,5,B00000G3AX,This movie documents the lives of two of the artists that worked at Disney for many years and created the characters and stories we loved as children.  Very enjoyable.,1388534400,,167,4.758620689655173
1215973,4,B00000G3AX,"Obviously, Walt Disney was not the one doing the actual animating for his classic films.  This is not to say that he doesn't deserve the credit for spearheading innovative material.  Nevertheless, this film helps shed some light on two of the individuals who were actually hunched over the drawing board.  It provides biographical info on Frank and Ollie, their approach to animation over the years and inside info on some of the other animators they worked with during their time at Disney.  If you're a Disney fan -- particularly of the classic animation -- it's a must.  If not, it may still appeal to you...just not quite so deeply.",1376352000,,636,4.798165137614679

1215975,5,B00000G3AX,Our family was so engrossed in this film that we watched all of it plus all of the bonus material in one sitting.  And we still wish it had been longer.  Loved every minute of it. These two were naturals on camera.  Made you wish you had known them personally.,1369699200,,260,4.16
1215976,4,B00000G3AX,"I have been a huge fan of animation since I was a kid and Disney while not my personal favorite then has climbed to the top of my list. This DVD contains a documentary featuring two of 'The 9 Old Men"" who brought so much magic to Disney and were the talent behind the genius Walt Disney.

The documentary is informative and very entertaining with insight and humor told by these two very talented men who formed a life long friendship. The main feature runs about a hour and forty minutes.

The bonus material is also very good, but there is a really irritating misstep in the menu. There is no Play All feature. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but the bonus material is broken up in 5 segments with 15 or so sub-segments. The lengths of these features range from 1 minute to 10 minutes all totaling around 45-55 minutes. Not having a Play All feature means that every couple minutes you have to go to the bonus menu and select another portion of these segments. It becomes tedious very quickly and brings my overall rating down a star.

This is certainly no reason to keep from buying this DVD and if you're a fan of the behind the scenes stuff or Disney animation fan, you'll want to add this to your collection.",1366675200,,1220,4.389380530973451

This is the quintessential film that shows how the personal lives of two best animator friends have created animation history's greatest films. (Sadly, Frank Thomas passed away a few years ago - I wonder how Ollie has been coping since then!) A MUST for any animation fan's movie library!!!",1322438400,,531,4.782608695652174
1216027,5,B00000G3AX,"I really loved this documentary.  I have always seen their names in so many of classic Disney movies, but had never heard their story.

1216028,4,B00000G3AX,"I hate to be the first person to give this item less than 5 stars since we've owned and enjoyed the VHS version for many years.  We just recently obtained the DVD, partly to see the extras.  The 'bonus' items were good, although I would have liked more.  Something that discussed the ""Nine Old Men"" as a group, focusing on Frank and Ollie's role within that esteemed body would have been fantastic.  The main reason for withholding a star is that the DVD Extras have no ""Play All"" feature.  Some of the bonus items are very short and going back to the menu each time is a pain and time waster.",1275350400,3,593,4.306306306306307
1216029,5,B00000G3AX,"Done by 1 of Frank's sons.

This film is a must for Disney fans.

Very interesting.

So glad to finally have it on DVD.

We learn about the last of the Nine Old Men of Animation  Sad they are all gone now  Frank passed away in 2004, Ollie in 2008.

I thought a personal note of interest to me.  Frank lived for a time in my home town when he was young.  This city is nothing to brag about.

Besides learning about them you of course get behind the scenes Disney facts from the early days.

You see Ollie & his personal train.  Just like Walt had at his home.  They lived right next door to each other.

WISH DISNEY STILL MADE DVD RELEASES LIKE THIS.

Has a chapter search list.  Good extras.  Making of, personal home movies, etc.

We Disney fans sure do miss them.",1273968000,2,765,4.123287671232877

1216072,5,B00000G3AX,The video show a little bit of Frank and Ollie friendship. It does have more to do with their personal life than animation aspects. But overall is a very sweet video with a good message.,1223769600,2,186,4.3428571428571425

1216075,5,B00000G3AX,"This is an absolute must for all Disney fans. Very few people will ever meet the people who were actually there and actively involved in the early years of the Disney Company. On top of the stuff mentioned in the older reviews there are two things that brought tears to my eyes. First is Ollie's interest in trains. Ollie along with animator Ward Kimball played key rolls in re-igniting Walt Disney's interest in trains, which as you probably already know was a foundation of Disneyland. The other thing was Franks longtime membership in the famed jazz band, The Firehouse Five Plus Two who played regularly at Disneyland. All seven members of the band were Disney animators. That was what was so fun regarding that band. One could go to Disneyland in the 1950s and 1960s and hear them on the weekends, then as one walked around the park you could see the characters, all of whom the band members played a roll in creating!

These two animation pioneers are no exception and they remain a guiding influence for today's storytellers as well.

The film on the life and career of Walt Disney's animation pioneers, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, remains as heartwarming and vibrant today as when it was first shown in theaters over twenty years ago.
