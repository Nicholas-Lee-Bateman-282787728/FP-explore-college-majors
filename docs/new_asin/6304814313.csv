7878733,5,6304814313,Bought as a gift for my husband.  He truly loved this one!  A must have for any hockey fan's collection.  He ranked this video higher than the NHL Greatest Moments.,1203465600,,164,4.4
7878734,3,6304814313,This is a great video for young hockey players to watch. We have a 25 minute drive to our rink so we pop this in the DVD player in the van and the 5 boys love it. It makes the drive a little easier.,1200355200,,198,3.522727272727273
7878735,3,6304814313,"My son is a hockey fanatic at the ripe, old age of 1.  I got this video because of all the rave reviews - but have been dissapointed.  THere are too many breaks in the hockey clips to hold my sons attention very well.  It has more talking than i waslead to believe and while the quality of the goals is as promised - the format is lacking.",1176854400,,339,3.9558823529411766
7878736,5,6304814313,"It is the excellent DVD with great goals.

Pros.

1) Every goal is repeated a few times from different points of view.

2) Great comments from best players. However, not too many, not boring at all.

3) Goals are nicely sorted by groups. I especially like that with spin-o-ramas. Hope they will continue this tradition.

4) Fair price.

Cons.

1) Pretty short movie (46 minutes, even less if you remove all titles).

2) 3:4, not a wide screen. The picture quality is good enough though.

In spite of some disadvantages, the movie is definately worth buying. I have watched it 4 or 5 times already. I watched it even with my friends who do not like ice hockey as much as we do. My middle son, 7 years old player, love the movie and watched it more than his favourite cartoons. It is hard to imagine, but it is true. Finally, he does not like so much some other disks we have (like Stanley Cup's collections). Moreover,  my older kid does not like any sports though he likes this movie! It is the best disk we have from NHL. It deserves 5 starts for sure.",1168992000,5,1053,4.3538461538461535
7878737,2,6304814313,"You would think that the nhl would be able to put out something better than this piece or work.  The ""hosts"" are corny and their segments are worthless.  The goals themselves are pretty good, but the most recent only go up to about 1995.  So don't expect any of the recent great goals that have been scored in the NHL.  Overall I would only recommend this product to fans who have followed hockey for 15 or 20 years.",1168819200,,416,4.294871794871795
7878738,4,6304814313,My 8 year old son and his father loved it!  It has many older players highlighted but they still enjoyed it!,1154908800,,108,4.142857142857143
7878739,5,6304814313,"I have owned this tape since it came out in 199(7?), and I don't understand why, with the lack of quality NHL highlights currently available on DVD (""All Access""?  Please...SO dated, SO five minutes ago), we don't have this collection of all-time highlights in a more accessible format for the modern hockey fan's entertainment center.

The goals, of course, are amazing.  All of the stars (well, at least those from the last quarter of the 20th Century; there simply isn't enough footage from the game's ""Original Six""/1967 Expansion era to make the grade) are well-represented.  The goals themselves are arranged according to category (historical significance, Stanley Cup goals, even a category for coast-to-coast and spin-o-rama scores), and you are sure to find your favorite sniper representin', from Bossy to Gretzky, Orr to Lemieux, Lafluer to Goulet to Bure to Fedorov to Jagr.

Add to the highlights the genuine goofiness of Denis Leary (terrifically unapologetic as the Boston Bruins fan he is) and some cameos and commentaries of some of the star players featured in the video (dating the presentation somewhat is the emphasis on Darren McCarty; don't worry, Wings fans...his incredible score against the Flyers in the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals is included) and the degree of levity makes the program and repeat viewings of it very enjoyable.

Maybe the NHL thinks that Denis Leary's commentary on the Stanley Cup history that is already available on DVD is enough; I think that with the state of the game as it is (specifically labor issues cancelling the 2004/05 season in its entirety and the generally dreadfully defensively suffocating nature of the game when it IS played at the NHL level), any reminder of the game's more artistic moments should be relayed to the masses...and more of the masses at this point include DVD players in their home entertainment systems than VHS decks.

Come on, Bettman...do AT LEAST ONE THING RIGHT before you completely destroy the sport; authorize the re-release of this package on DVD.",1108944000,15,2036,5.096096096096096
7878740,4,6304814313,"Back in the '80s when teams actually tried to score we got Mario Lemieux's between the legs beauty, Wayne Gretzky scoring 802 NHL goals! and Bobby Orr flying through the air. A good selection of classic NHL goals are here and shows us all what we're missing in the NHL of the '90s and '00s.",1106870400,6,290,4.290909090909091
