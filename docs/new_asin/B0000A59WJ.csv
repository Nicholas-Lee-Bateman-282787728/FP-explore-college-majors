1902609,4,B0000A59WJ,"I am enjoying this DVD.  Each song is longer than the original, I think...  so you don't realize how long you are exersizing.  I will be buying more Richard Simmons!",1128124800,15,165,4.433333333333334
1902610,2,B0000A59WJ,"I know Richard Simmons helps a lot of people, but I found this DVD to be difficult to follow.  Richard's cuing is practically non-existent.  Also, it's difficult to follow the moves when the camera is focusing on someone's face instead of their body.  I was very disapointed and plan on giving this away to a relative.",1113350400,19,318,4.642857142857143
1902611,5,B0000A59WJ,"This is such a fun workout that once you get the moves down, you'll hardly know you're working out until you're done and realize how sweaty you've gotten.  This was one of the first Simmons aerobic routines I'd done, so it took a few tries for me to get the routine down - but don't give up because you WILL get it.

As with most of Richard Simmon's workouts, you start out with a warm up and each song is progressively a little more energetic until the cool-down - this one is 30 minutes in total length.  Also featured in every Simmons routine I've done so far, and this is no exception, are his motivational and encouraging comments.

If you doubt you're really getting a workout, take a look at some of the other (less fun) tapes and you'll see many of the same motions, exercises and stretches.  The difference is the fun and pure joy Richard Simmons brings to his videos.  Why do plain old exercises when you can dance and have fun with Richard?  I've never hurt myself with any of his routines, as I have with others (particularly my knees).  If you're looking for a safe but effective toning workout, I recommend Blast and Tone, as well as Tone and Sweat.

One word of caution - Richard Simmons IS addictive.",1112486400,139,1216,4.417040358744394
1902612,4,B0000A59WJ,"This is the first Richard Simmons video I have tried, and I am sold.  The music is upbeat, the moves are easy to learn, and I actually look forward to exercising every day.

1902693,5,B0000A59WJ,Started at 365lbs down 15. My mom started at 230 and is down 10lbs. I'm 30 and she's 51. We both really enjoyed this video right away. Technically we've been using this video for 3 days but we've been alternating Simmons videos for 4 weeks. This isobar favorite so we use this one every day on top of the two we alternate: we have ordered another video so this will drop to every other day. I'm sad about that but we want to keep things fresh. When we start getting used to the videos we change it up just a bit. We're not perfect but we do our best and Richard Simmons makes us feel like that is good enough. Because of that we're gradually getting better and getting closer to really keeping up with him a small his crew.,1430697600,,723,4.171428571428572

1902695,3,B0000A59WJ,I love Richard Simmons workout videos. They are a fun workout activity that my grandma and me love to do together. This one however was my least favorite. It might just be the fact that I am use to the Sweatin to The Oldies but I didn't like the slower pace or that the video would move up and focus on faces so you couldn't see what the feet were doing anymore. It was still fun and a good workout just not as good as Sweatin to the Oldies.,1430438400,4,441,3.966292134831461

I was doing a 25 minute workout to Shaun T but at my age it was really difficult... I just liked that it was 25 minutes so recently I saw this tape for 30 minutes and it fits into my schedule and I have to tell you it does make me smile.  While the dance moves are not complicated I tend to step up my routine and run instead of walk so I can work up a sweat and to get more benefit out of this workout... but love it!",1412208000,,586,3.642857142857143

1902727,5,B0000A59WJ,I've exercised with a number of Richard Simmons's DVDs and like all of them -- but there is just something more fun about this one -- I actually feel like I'm dancing instead of exercising. Highly recommend.,1394755200,,207,4.621621621621622
1902728,3,B0000A59WJ,Not for a beginner.  There are too many steps and no forewarning as to when and what you are changing to.  I imagine if you keep up with it you will eventually get it but not for this senior,1394668800,,190,3.8461538461538463

I received this order quickly, the casing in great shape.  I opened it up & noted what I thought was a scratch. Used DVD and scratches not so unusual.  I had to leave the next day for work and was gone for over a month, leaving this DVD unplayed.  When I got home & tried using it, discovered that the 'scratch' was instead a deep groove which caused the dvd to play approx. 10 minutes befored freezing. When I contacted Amazon about this was informed it was past the return time in their guarantee, Amazon did give my request to  Goodwill of Silicon Valley which had sold to me. They too refused to let me return this. I have done a lot of business with Amazon & this is 1st time they haven't come through. Yes it's my fault for not actually viewing the DVD upon receipt. As all the others I have purchased have been good, I didn't feel the necessity to do so.  It's not Amazon I blame but Goodwill of Silicon Valley. They are the ones that sold it. I will never buy any item from Goodwill of Silicon Valley ever again! They lied about the condition of this DVD and when confronted about it wouldn't allow me to return this.

1902762,5,B0000A59WJ,"I love Richard Simons videos. I had them all in VHS and now have them in CD's.
His videos are fun with music you know and can sing along. He leads you through
some stretching, warm-up, cardio and cool-down.  Also, the people who are
doing it with him are all sizes and shapes-- not perfect bodies to intimidate you.
It's easy to adjust your movements to your ability level. I can't keep up with them
right now after not doing any cardio or real exercising for several years, but I can
walk in place, or do side steps, leaving my arms out of it if I'm getting too winded
or my heart rate is too high, and then join in following them again no problem
when I'm ready to. Soon, sticking with  doing it, I'll be able to keep up.
Having fun, I'll also lose weight and inches as I did in the past. I have several of
RS's exercise videos, do a different one each time and never get tired of them.
I may be tired, but I always feel better after doing one. Once I get back into shape,
I should just feel exhilarated.",1369094400,,1006,4.127551020408164

1902791,5,B0000A59WJ,"I needed to get a regular routine of exercise that would get me sweating and my heart rate up for at least 20 minutes at a time. I do yoga, I walk my dog, I walk a lot at work, but none of these did what I needed. I tried a gym and was bored with the machines and then found I couldn't afford the gym fee. I then happened to see this dvd at the library and tried it. It does exactly what I need, gets the heart rate up, gets me sweating and pushing past my limits, and I feel great afterwards. It is fun, not boring, and I can do it in a small space in my livingroom (on the wood floor).  I now have several others of this series and so far this dvd is my favorite. The more you use these dvd's the more you start to know the routines. If some part of it isn't good for me for some reason (a knee problem for one), I just change the movement a bit to fit my need and keep going.",1366156800,,878,3.7204301075268815

I didn't make it all the way through the first time but I had a ball anyway.  One of the ways to keep you brain working is to learn new things.  This was like learning new dance steps.  The exercises were choreographed like dance routines from Broadway musicals.  I loved it!,1332547200,,405,4.333333333333333

1902810,1,B0000A59WJ,"This was the worst Simmons DVD I have ever seen. I know Richard Simmons wants to make his videos fun and make you forget you are doing an exercise video. The way this is achieved is with fast, FAST movesand the camera pans to the faces of participants so you can see how much fun they are having. BUT, you cannot see the moves. Then there is a fish eye view that comes in sometimes (because that is fun right) and distorts further. The participants are mostly average size and only 1 or 2 that I would consider large. That is the best part of Simmons' videos. You think... if that big person can do it, I can too! There are 3 people who look like typical aerobics instructors and they are SO overly exuberant you want to smack them. Seriously, I don't want to see the participants singing along to the songs if I can't tell what they are doing. This is a video to help me lose weight, I do want it to be fun, but if I have to keep stopping, I'm not working out. After 15 minutes of tripping on my own feet, I turned it off. That isn't an effective workout. I don't want to have to spend 3 or 4 hours trying to figure out the choreography. I have no plans on performing this on stage! I wanted a 30 min video to do early in the morning, and most of Simmons' videos are 50 mins. This was meant to allow me an extra 30 mins sleep in the morning.

Like his other videos, he has people of all sizes in the video, working at different levels, so it is great for any exercise level.

1902855,5,B0000A59WJ,"I have to admit being a little apprehensive about buying this but, now, I'm glad that I did. It's easy once you get into the swing. If you grew up in the 60's you'll remember the dances so it will come back to you.

Buy it! Definitely worth the risk.",1180483200,8,250,4.0

1902857,2,B0000A59WJ,"This tape is only about 30 minutes long so it's not a very good value.

They show the other people too often so that it is hard to follow at first.  They show the people smiling and having fun but fail to show you what the moves are.",1175212800,6,233,3.8333333333333335

1902881,5,B0000A59WJ,I was very pleased with this and found it to be fun to do. The music was a trip down memory lane and was a good workout.,1173312000,9,120,3.4814814814814814
1902882,5,B0000A59WJ,"I love dancing, & Richard makes it not only fun, but beneficial at the same time. It's a great workout, but not too much. The DVD came very quickly, & in excellent condition. Great buy!",1171843200,5,185,4.314285714285714
1902883,1,B0000A59WJ,"I ordered the Richard Simmons Disco and Blast Off.

The Blast Off is not worth it.  Richard does not give

contsistant instructions and he goes too fast.  I have

had a lot of Richards excercise programs and this one

is not worth it.

The Disco is a lot of fun!!",1168300800,9,263,4.14
1902884,3,B0000A59WJ,"I had alot of fun exercising to this CD, only my livingroom wasn't big enough for both my husband and I to exercise together!",1154908800,3,125,4.25
1902885,1,B0000A59WJ,"I'm very disappointed with this DVD.  For one thing, Richard Simmons does not cue us viewers what to do first before we can follow along his exercise routines.  It was very difficult to follow especially when the camera focuses on the faces of the women on the DVD instead of on Richard.  You are left off guessing whether to go left or right, go forward or backward, etc.  The music was just okay.  I Definitely Don't Recommend ""60's Blast Off.""

I do recommend:

Leslie Sansone's ""Walk the Walk"" DVD: 1 & 2 mile (inspirational music on the background)

For this DVD, Leslie DOES cue you what to do first in her Low Impact exercise routines.  It's very easy to follow Leslie's directions and there's no difficult dance steps to follow.  You go at your own pace.  It's a wonderful exercise to begin your day, because you are also counting your blessings and including God.  So, whenever you are feeling down and stressed out, exercise with Leslie Sansone and her friends.  You will break out in a sweat and feel a lot better afterwards.

God Bless You anyways, Richard Simmons!",1149465600,25,1077,4.62962962962963
1902886,1,B0000A59WJ,"This dvd is horrible! First of all i am so disapointed! I thought hey richard simmons can't go wrong with that choice. Boy was i wrong! The company that filmed the true 60's oldies focused on mostly the womens big faces. So, where am getting extremely hard to follow! When you think your right your not! I don't recommend it! Also, the music choice is very poor! None energetic songs from the early 60's it smeems. I love 60's music i thought i heard those songs, but i was wrong. They must be the ones that didn't become popular. I would have never thought richard simmons could get so much love and energy from cheesie 60's music.

I do recommend. Winsor Pilates maximun burn.

  Sara Ivanhoe's 20min yoga makeover for weightloss.

  Belly Dance fitness for weight loss pure sweat featuring rania.

  Island Girl dance fitness workoutfor beginners hula abs and buns with kili.

Mostly all also have for low impact.",1145491200,26,916,4.6625
1902887,1,B0000A59WJ,"I did not like this exercise video!  I have Richard Simmons ""Sweating to the Oldies"", which is pretty good.  The songs are old, but recognizable, so I thought I would like this one.  Not!!!  On ""Sixties Blast Off"" the songs are real 'old foggie' songs, real old school rock and roll, and not good ones.  If you're under the age of 55 (I'm 48) you probably won't like or recognize any of these songs.  Also, I found the routines fast and furious w/o alot of direction before a move change, and there were alot of move changes.  You didn't know whether to kick, punch, move left, right, forward, backward, turn, cha-cha, arms up, arms down.  It was crazy!!!! I'm in pretty good shape and have been exercising regularly for quite some time and wanted to add something different to my routine, but it's not going to be this.  You probably could catch on after the 4th or 5th time, IF you like the music.  I was dissappointed with this video.",1144368000,23,937,4.458823529411765
1902888,4,B0000A59WJ,"Fun video and you will find yourself sweating.  Richard does it again, and it is refreshing to exercise with regular people.  Athough a bit confusing at first, hang in there, you will get it.  The only criticism I would give is that the camera often moved to the particpants faces, or panned from person to person, at times making it difficult to follow.

But it is worth the money.",1144022400,5,382,4.492753623188406
1902889,1,B0000A59WJ,"This is advertised as 30 minutes, but it's only 20 minutes of exercise and 10 minutes of cool down.  Very hard to follow since there's no cuing and camera regularly focuses on people's faces just as Richard is doing a new move.  The creative cinematography sometimes blurs (I guess to show people are moving) but it's very disconcerting when you're trying to follow along.  I'll try this a few more times but it definitely is not for people who appreciate a really good workout.",1141862400,20,478,4.666666666666667
1902890,5,B0000A59WJ,I have always been very lazy and never one for any type of excercise. I bought this dvd plus different brands. I first put in a different brand and I was so lost. I put Richard in and I was instantly uplifted and began to go with the flow. People are right the moves are hard to follow at first but because of the upbeatness of Richard and the music you just move and try your best. At the end of the 30 mins that only felt like 10 you realize you have sweated more during this movie than in your whole life. I have never been a Richard fan before but know I love him and plan to get all his videos. I do two Richard videos a day and encourage all to give him a try.,1136505600,33,666,3.8333333333333335
