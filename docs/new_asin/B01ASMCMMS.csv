8748208,4,B01ASMCMMS,"i saw this series on the funi app. its incredible. great story and characters. only complaint is the 3d cg. it will never be good as 2d, but i will say the 3d cg is definetly some of the best. my only complaint is 50 SOMETHING DOLLERS FOR A BLU RAY WHAT THE FUDGE!!! and that makes the whole series like 100 dollars like come on. i guess thats what happens when your the niche of a niche...",1515456000,,390,4.012820512820513
8748209,4,B01ASMCMMS,I had part two for a loooooong time and was waiting to get this.  I originally watched on a DL but after seeing it I thought it was worth the money to add to my collection.  A lot more story then you'd think and some real personal struggles from the main character to the main villain. The animation was nice and the 3D-ish stuff was not to killing.  Worth the watch and add to your anime collection.,1499644800,,400,4.1688311688311686

8748211,5,B01ASMCMMS,"Amazing in every way. Medieval fantasy horror settings. There's like one good anime in this category so this is welcome addition to Berserk only genra (i don't count Clayborne, its awful). Characters are some of the best in recent years. Heck, might be the best. The show is just has an adult vibe. NO FANCERVICE, Thank God. No crazy anime faces or goofy up skirt shots. it almost looks western. simply the hidden gem of 2014.

Dont listen to the cgi haters. this cgi is easily the best iv seen. Maybe berserk 2016 and Ajin developers should have talked to these guys. Makai Nights are a spectacle every time they equip the armor. Anywho, if ur wondering if season two is a let down, let me tell u its almost better. Thers also a movie coming out that takes place 4 years after season 2. I cant praise this show enough so let me show u my list of top ten anime so u can see what i consider great anime
