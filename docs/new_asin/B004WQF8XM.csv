8445586,5,B004WQF8XM,"I really enjoyed this wonderful movie/documentary . Really gives you a glimpse on what some Fathers  go through when they have not one ,but two children born with a type of muscular distrophy.
  To sum it up you can truly admire this mans love for his children. Mixed Martial Arts has been drawing large crowds due to it's growing popularity. Mark at the age of 40 and being a fan of the MMA climbed into the ring to share with the crowd the fight he goes through on a daily basis. Not an easy task considering Mark has a full time job and is the sole provider for his children. Putting your own body at risk of getting injured when your a father is not an easy decision. But because of his love for his children and having the proper training from excellent trainer's Mark was victorious in the ring and brought to all of our attention that there are children suffering with this life threatening disease and we all as responsible adults need to come together to find a cure.
  I encourage all to buy this great DVD and help support the cause.",1309651200,,1044,4.360824742268041
