7684907,5,B01CK0ASH2,"I love this video.  It has so many views of the gorgeous Pyrenees Mountains that it is hard to decide which of the three rides to choose.  There is a scene of a craggy mountain face against the backdrop of a dark storm clouds, which is spectacular.  The mountains are lovely and the village is picturesque.  The filming is professional, high quality work.  I am so glad that I have this DVD in my collection.  While this is advertised as an exercise accompaniment video it is great for just relaxing, too. I also use some of my Virtual Walking and Virtual Cycle Ride DVDs for meditation.  The nature sounds can be very relaxing as well as a great exercise tool.",1460332800,,661,4.458333333333333
7684908,5,B01CK0ASH2,"The Tour de France bike route is partially included in this lovely DVD of the mountain range that separates France and Spain.  After watching the preview I decided to purchase this DVD and I am glad I did.  It offers not only spectacular footage of the Pyrenees Mountains but scenes of a peaceful stream and a quaint village.  There is even a stray cow along the route to make the ride a bit different.  Beautiful and colorful.  Natural sounds and three bike routes to choose from.  Great videography, too.",1460332800,,506,4.629213483146067

8753353,5,B01CK0ASH2,"I LOVE THIS. The scenery is beautiful the pace is perfect (I ride an Airdyne while I watch this) but best of all was the surprise appearance of three livestock guarding dogs just like mine! I have several of these dvds and they all greatly improve my indoor workout, but this one is my favorite.",1494633600,,295,4.381818181818182
8753354,5,B01CK0ASH2,Was very very pleased with this order.  Takes the monotony out of exercising and enjoy the journey of biking through the beautiful terrain.. Highly recommend,1489795200,,157,5.28
8753355,3,B01CK0ASH2,"When I started the DVD I saw three options and thought that there were three different rides so I chose the first one. Only after it had finished did I realize that I had played the complete hour-long video. I wondered why there were occasional breaks in the movie and they turned out to be the breaks between the three options. The birds singing and the scenery was nice but it would have been better if there had been more action, at least in one part of the video. I think there was one man and a few sheep during the whole hour. I was talking to myself by the end of the DVD. I would have liked real people waving or speaking as you rode by.  I couldn't work up any real enthusiasm for the ride. I was waiting for something to happen.  Maybe I chose the wrong video..... It was just nice......... Sorry",1488153600,,806,4.193548387096774

8753357,5,B01CK0ASH2,"I bought this DVD for my mom to help her lose weight on her exercise bike. It's a quaint, straightforward ""ride"" through the mountains. There is no coaching or regiment on this DVD - it's strictly just the sights and sounds of nature. I really like it a lot, as does my mom. This is a great program for an absolute beginner to exercise, as it creates a welcome, easy ride to get the muscles moving. People looking for a more intense workout should probably look elsewhere, but for beginners or the elderly this is a great product. Pop it in and you're off!",1483315200,,556,4.355769230769231
8753358,5,B01CK0ASH2,"Virtual Cycle DVDs always give you great, stable straight-ahead imagery of a well-edited themed ride.  This particular ride begins on a rural road heading towards mountains on a beautiful spring day.  The pace is quick and with few transitions you can quickly get into a mesmerizing workout zone.  The road on the second ride begins on the side of a hill.  At times it looks a bit rougher, but the video stays smooth.  Eventually youll make your way to and through a small town, and then on to some green forest, more mountain views, and finally finishing in another lovely little town.  The third ride begins in a forest near the base of a canyon.  After winding around the base of the canyon youll ride between a small town and a river.  In this video you feel alone in the world  I counted about 6 cars, 4 people, and 1 cat.",1469664000,,827,4.423841059602649
8753359,5,B01CK0ASH2,"Virtual Cycle DVDs always give you great, stable straight-ahead imagery of a well-edited themed ride.  This ride is great for strength and endurance.  It begins on a mountain road surrounded by pasture, with more mountains just beyond.  The pace is quick and even  a couple of times you even pass other bikes.  It looks like you are above the tree line and there are no guard rails, so the view is wide open.  Ride 2 begins in a green forest next to a small river  made even more striking because of the lack of trees in ride 1. Youll ride through a quaint little town and then start to climb up a hill (so crank up that resistance!).  The second half of this ride has some great rolling hills through fields and forests.  As you start to climb higher, the trees thin out and the landscape becomes more like the first ride.  The third ride again also begins in pasture land, but the mountains seem a bit farther away.  You make your way up another hill and are rewarded with the view of a valley before you head back down.  The vistas and views in this DVD are just beautiful, so a trip to the Pyrenees is going to have to go on the bucket list.",1469664000,,1145,4.25
8753360,5,B01CK0ASH2,"This DVD provides diversified scenery of the French Pyrenees. Sometimes you can cycle through a typical French village, sometimes it goes up to the mountains, very close to the edge. The sky looks very picturesque on the DVD and the sun's light is warm and relaxing. The speed is very suitable for training on the exercise machine, also you can find other bicyclists here. The sounds, such as the chirping of birds or water sounds, enhance the realistic training experience. A great DVD.",1466035200,,487,4.879518072289157
8753361,5,B01CK0ASH2,"This DVD from the Ambient Collection [Virtual Cycle Rides: Spanish Pyrenees] brought back a lot of memories. As a young man, with absolutely zero biking experience, I pedaled from Malaga (sea level) to Madrid (2,200 above sea level), up and down 530 km of mountain ranges. What an experience. And what an experience this DVD offers!
You have a choice of three distinct journeys to pep up your cycling workout, each ride lasting about 20 minutesor you can loop them for a continuous ride.

Ride One: the pace is leisurely, under a bright blue sky, on an old traffic-less road that goes on forever. You can actually see the road disappear into the horizon, which gives you the feeling of an endless bike ride. The scenery is spectacular; the route is varied [Up and Down], so you won't be bored; you can race downhill with the wind in your hair, or plod up the endless climbs, as the weather changes before your eyes.

Ride Two: is a little more edgy. The pace is faster; the landscape more dangerous. A guard rail is all that separates you from a thousand foot drop. How did they ever build this road, which seems to have been cut out of the mountain side? You pass through an ancient town that seems hewn out of the same rock as the mountain. Another town appears at the top of your climb, at the end of the ride, signaling that its time for a glass of Spanish vino.

Ride Three: is a little more mysterious, you ride down into a valley of shadow, formed by trees and steep canyon wallsand into the black hole of a tunnel somehow bored through the rock. You get a deep, deep, canyon-all-around-you feeling as you eventually work your way into the sun. But now rain clouds threaten, and the pace picks up as if you are looking for shelter. At the end of the ride, you reach another ancient townand you feel as if youve been on a real journey.

What a great way to spice up your gym cycling!",1460851200,7,1889,4.404011461318052
