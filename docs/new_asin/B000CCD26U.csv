If you are just starting out just remember the only way you can fail is to quit.  These workouts are uber challenging but you will feel like a super hero after you're done... I do (maybe because I am but I digress.)  If you find you are maxing out, just take Billy's advice and walk out a few sets and jump back in.  Staying in the present moment is extremely helpful too.  A mantra I use that may help you is, ""Inch by inch life's a cinch, yard by yard, life is hard.""  Do each move mindfully and stay in the present and inch by inch you'll be done, and be a better person for it.",1271548800,,785,4.158940397350993
8097054,5,B000CCD26U,"I'm a Billy Blanks Tae Bo fan, and I really enjoyed this workout.  I was just getting back into Tae Bo, so the Basic workouts were great.  I progressed to the advanced and really noticed a difference. I did these every day for 6 weeks and lost 15 pounds, and really noticed a difference in my body.",1205193600,,298,4.2105263157894735
8097055,5,B000CCD26U,"I have had bad knees for years. I enjoy jogging, doing kettlebells, etc, however cannot do those things on a regular basis without making my knees worse. I was very apprehensive that this workout would be the same. To my relief, my knees feel good even after doing the basic workouts almost every day for the past 3 weeks.

Yesterday I moved from the basic to the advanced. I really worked up a good sweat doing 45 minutes (didn't make it to the end). I occasionally was forced to drop the intensity or put a foot down during the leg raises, and had a little trouble with a few of the moves/combos, but I am learning fast. I am confident that within 3 weeks I will be able to complete this workout and keep pace with the ""class"".

This is a great set to start with. The instructional is important for those new to Tae Bo. It not only teaches the proper form but explains why the move should be done that way. The set allows you progress and the 2 advanced workouts are probably all you need to get in great shape if done on a regular basis at high intensity.

Another reviewer didn't care for Billy constantly talking through the workout. I can understand how the somewhat repetitive instruction and cheerleading might get old for more experienced people, but I really appreciate his positive energy and reminders about proper form. I find him very inspirational and not at all annoying thus far. I look forward to these workouts.",1192579200,3,1430,4.492307692307692
8097056,5,B000CCD26U,"I have several Billy Blanks workout dvds and enjoyed all of them, but this one in particular sends you on a physical journey that will test your stamina and strength. I workout often and consider myself in fairly good shape but this video will push you too the true test plus the exercises are fun.",1184803200,,298,4.4363636363636365
8097057,5,B000CCD26U,"I am a Taebo and B.blanks fan, and I've been looking for a killer workout.  I started back in the late 90s with the original 4 tape vhs set, and I also own Cardio and Bootcamp 2 series.  I've rented a couple others, because I have been looking for the hardest most advanced workout I could find.  Those other ones are good, even though Cardio wasn't as challenging as I had hoped for.  Boot Camp 2, I do both workouts back to back for the killer burn I desire, so its not challenging enough.  My search is over with Get Ripped Series.  I found this jem on Amazon, and I've read some great reviews.  Its a 2 disk set with 6 workouts: 2 8 minute, 2 basic, and 2 advanced workouts.  Billy don't play on these workouts folks.  The basic workout is much harder than the bootcamp ones, and the advanced ones are killer.  You are talking near 60 minutes from start to finish or stretching and pure workout hell.  Billy pushes you at a pace that I have to work my way up to.  Boot Camp 2 is good, but I have to do both workouts back to back to get the burn from just one of the Ripped Advanced workouts.  I freaking love and you will too, once you build some stamina.  The fact the entire set is under ten bucks is a plus too.  Go for it and you won't be sorry.",1176336000,7,1253,4.057142857142857
