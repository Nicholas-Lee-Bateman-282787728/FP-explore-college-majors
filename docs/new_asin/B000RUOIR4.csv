8202541,5,B000RUOIR4,"I'm delighted by this fractal manifestation! I use this to accompany self-training for neurofeedback, and it provides an ideal environment. (During training, the DVD plays at full strength and sound when brainwaves are within the desired range of coherence, dimming when the brainwaves stray from this range.)

The music may not be to everyone's taste, but then, it's always possible to listen to the soundrack of one's choice. Recommended for the visuals.",1479340800,,456,5.333333333333333
8202542,5,B000RUOIR4,"Beautiful fractal animations which seem mostly to involve fluidly changing parameters of the equations rather than zooming and color cycling as other, also beautiful, fractal animations I've seen tended to use. A couple of the segments were just outstanding. The music seemed mostly algorithmic as well. I wish Josh Cooper would include more info on how these were generated and hope for more from him.",1381449600,,402,5.2
8202543,5,B000RUOIR4,It is surprisingly difficult to find fractal videos that are enjoyable.  This one has lovely colors and a very reasonable speed of movement.,1370476800,,140,5.086956521739131
8202544,5,B000RUOIR4,"This vid is a MUST HAVE for any visual artist. If you've read my other reviews of the usual Createspace offal, you will know that I don't like this studio; but here they've done something unusual: created a visual masterpeice of fractiles that has blown me away.

I can't begin to say how important haveing, yes, haveing a copy of this dvd is and will be to artist of all stripes and various feilds.  Watch it a hundred times, add it to memory, and let it run around in your uncounchous. You will be glad you did!",1298246400,,513,4.278350515463917
8202545,5,B000RUOIR4,"I used this as a backdrop while DJing, projected on a 19' screen and the image was fantastic, nothing like the downloads.",1213747200,4,121,4.545454545454546
8202546,2,B000RUOIR4,"Although I love fractals, I returned this video. It appears someone figured out a technique to move colorful painting like designs down the Mandelbrot level lines. This technique only is featured at various locations in the M-set with slow panning. No zooms. It looks neat for a few minutes then is just the same all through. But the worst is the horrible music track - nuff said.",1199664000,14,380,4.686567164179104
8202547,5,B000RUOIR4,It's rare to find scientific images that are artistically beautiful. Jock obviously has a great sense of color palette and design in creating these amazing fractal animations. They give a revelatory sense of discovering something universally organic.,1188432000,10,250,5.783783783783784
