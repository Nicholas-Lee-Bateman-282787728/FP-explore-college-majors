7664493,5,B01BNJ8MF6,"I wasn't sure I would like this, but I thought, what the hell, at least people are still talking about this part of history.  It is excellent!  The songs are outstanding, the actors and actresses really seem to be enthused, and it is something I have used to try to explain a little bit of the 1916 uprising to friends not familiar with it.  Glad I bought it and will replay it over and over to remind myself that the fight is not over.",1465776000,12,436,4.166666666666667

7664507,3,B01BNJ8MF6,"There's a smidgen of Irish in me and this settled a lot of my confusion about what the heck has been going on in Ireland for so long.  It answered a lot of my questions about the origins and impacts on modern Ireland. However, it felt like a Ken Burns production gone bad, to a degree: the frequent insertion of modern city scenes was a distraction. Story could have been told in two chapters instead of three.  Liam Neeson's narration was excellent.  A point made in this telling was that the British had a bit of disdain for the Irish - their apparent inability to organize a resistance.  That point reminded me of the same British attitude toward Arabs, as revealed in the movie Lawrence of Arabia, when Lawrence told told Ali something like ""as long as keep fighting among yourselves, you will always be a little people"".",1484265600,2,825,4.554054054054054

7664519,5,B01BNJ8MF6,"A very perceptive view of the 1916 Rising.  The research was excellent.  It dealt very well with the wider implications of The Easter Rising, particularly with the impending furure of the British Empire.  The film dealt with the subject matter objectively - a welcome change from many programmes which have dealt with this part of history over emotionally.  And the DVD is good value.",1472688000,,384,4.953125

7664521,5,B01BNJ8MF6,"Before a recent trip to Dublin, I read as much as I could about the city, the country's history, and bits of works by Irish authors - for example, some of Joyce's Dubliners, ( but I couldn't go theough Ulysses again!). I was thrilled to find the Sundance TV series on the Irish Rebellion of 1916. From the first scene of 3 'Little Maids' in an amateur production of the Mikado through the bloody Easter Rebellion and beyond, you will be 'hooked.'",1471046400,5,446,4.451219512195122

8750834,5,B01BNJ8MF6,"Fantastic in every cinematic way. I am a big history buff, an Irish folk singer and amateur historian.  I have always been put off by NONHISTORICAL STORIES who pass themselves off as HISTORICAL FACT. Truth is always better than fiction. Briona Nic Dhiarmada, Chistopher Fox,and Stuart Switzer have really outdone themselves. And getting Liam Neeson to narrate was a stroke of genius. I cannot say enough and praise this bit of TRUE IRISH HISTORY to the extent that it needs to be praised. A must see for all who can appreciate a Struggle for FREEDOM & LIBERTY.  Ron J.
