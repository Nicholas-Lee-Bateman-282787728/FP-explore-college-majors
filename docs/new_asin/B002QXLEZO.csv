8378108,4,B002QXLEZO,"This video was produced in 2006 and it is getting a little dated. Within a matter of a couple of years, such things as economy, tourism, tours, etc., it will be out of date and irrelevant. Please keep that in mind when ordering this DVD. Other than that, it is an extremely well directed tourism video. It went into a decent amount of time describing and detailing everything from tourism, the beaches, the museums, the hotels, the history, the food, sports, and the parades. Not too short, nor too long detailing these and many other highlights. Overall, it was a great introduction into the island of Curacao. I would indeed recommend it to others, but I would strongly suggest Blind Eye Video to keep it current with the times as it is getting dated. After the video is over, the DVD had about ten mini-chapters you could view. These chapters were specialty chapters such as Jewish Heritage, biker events, dolphin therapy, unique museums, etc., to name a few. Each chapter was anywhere from one to three minutes long. That was an added bonus in my eyes.",1397952000,,1056,4.682795698924731
8378109,5,B002QXLEZO,"Nicely made DVD revealing this little known and beautiful GEM of an island in the dutch carribean, just off the coast of venezuela and next to it's sister island of Aruba.  Curacao is an amazing island with the most beautiful coves of beaches, not stretches of sand as in most places including Aruba, but intimate coves that are tranquil with crystal clear turquoise waters.  The food on the island is amazing too....the best is probably the Indonesian food. Amazing stuff !",1269216000,3,474,4.839506172839506
