2796337,5,B000OIOOUU,"I re-watched season 3 and this show deserves every award possible.  I loved seasons 1 & 2, and the 3rd doesn't disappoint.  And best of all it is so FUNNY. Definitely the funniest season yet. I laughed so much in the first half of this season, which was a nice complement to some of the really heavy intensity of season 2.  ""I might need a sandwich...Mrs. Turbidy""

Denis Leary is a god.  Not just a brilliant producer, comic, writer, but his acting is just stellar. And I don't know if anyone could ever top the performance of Steve Pasquale as Garrity.  His comic timing is impeccable and he is 100% convincing as one of the stupidest but most harmless guys in the world.  He was really at the top of his game in Season 3. He had great material to work with but his delivery is top notch.  All the characters are just such a mess, but it's never taken to a level where it seems ridiculous and unbelievable.  And the fact that the women are just as much a mess as the men makes it even more believable, it's not just about a bunch of firefighters afterall.  It's also about the women in their lives and how dysfunctional all of their relationships are.  I knew a couple like Tommy and Janet once, and it's scripted here to perfection. The johnny and janet plot line was a bit over the top for me at first, but then it was handled so well with Angela that it became believable.  And at times i felt like the Probie sexuality issues were a bit cliche, like the writers felt they needed to have a storyline like that at some point in the show.  But it all works.  That's the brilliance here..no matter what they do, it works.  I was nervous that the seasons would get progressively worse and more contrived like most series do, but not this one. Not yet.  And hopefully we can enjoy many more stellar seasons to come. No matter what happens down the road, Denis Leary needs to always be creating and performing!",1181433600,7,1909,4.350282485875706
2796338,5,B000OIOOUU,"Rescue me is the best show on TV by far. This season was pretty edgy even though it had mellowed a little from previous. Buy it, you'll like it, but buy it from the beginning (season 1) so you understand all the characters a little better, besides, it will be worth the money.

  As my title says, check out ""The Job"" Dennis Leary's original pilot. Only lasted one season, because America wasn't up for an edgy dramatic comedy like this at the time. It is a little more PG but hilarious none the less.",1181174400,3,501,4.308510638297872
2796339,5,B000OIOOUU,"'Rescue Me' is one of the best shows to come along in a very long time! This Season (3)is full of the same drama, comedy and action we've come to expect from this series. It's one of the most insightful series I've ever seen and this year they've added some very intriging twists. The characters are well developed and the writing is top notch in this drama, action, and comedy series. If you haven't watched this program, you are missing one of the most entertaining series of all time. The show is shot in widescreen and the DVD transfers look excellent on a big screen. This season includes commentary and some interesting extras.",1180742400,2,633,4.610619469026549
2796340,5,B000OIOOUU,"I could give you a detailed synopsis of season 3 but the previous reviewer did a god job and there is no need to say it again. What I will say is if you are looking for a show that can make you cry, laugh, and feel fuzzy inside, all in one episode, then this is the show for you. In my opinion Rescue Me is the best original show I have ever seen on cable television, possibly all time. Rescue blows The Shield completely away.

The actors in this show are phenominal, most are actors not seen anywhere else, but everyonce in a while a huge actor will make an appearance or two. But every actor plays their part exceptionally well. Dennis Leary is the star of the show and his acting is way beyond any expectations I ever had of him.

As the previous review stated, this season does not having the shocking moments but it has just as much if not more intensity than the other two combined.

This is by far the best show on TV!!!!!",1177804800,15,930,4.155555555555556
2796341,4,B000OIOOUU,"The third season of ""Rescue Me"" is good but it should have been better. It plays out like a Greek Tragedy in which two bros battle it out over a piece a trash, and even though we know where the road we are on is headin' we stay on anyways just to gawk at the carnage. And carnage we get, but the overarching storyline just doesn't feel as tight as it should. TV is still an emerging art form and the idea of stretching a story over 13 episodes (or 585 minutes) has yet to be mastered. So along the way we get very melodramatic and soapy subplots to hold us over. Some of these are misfires (Probie being gay) and others just don't make sense (Susan Sarandon's character stealing Franco's daughter). There is also a movement in this season away from the firehouse and towards the crazy Gavin Family. Tommy's uncle being in jail was the low point of the season. If we have learned anything from the first two seasons of this show it is that nothing ends well for these characters and don't expect anything different here. What you can expect is good writing, and when this show is on it is on. Notice the scene in the first episode where Tommy tries to convince his womanizing godson that maybe sleeping with his teacher isn't the best idea. The repartee is razor sharp and hilarious and represents to me why this show still belongs on the upper echelon on shows currently on the air.

This season picks up with Tommy recovering from his son's death. To make matters worse his brother is moving into his old territory (Janet) and Sheila is pushing him very hard to settle down with her. Everything here is soaked in an atmosphere of impending doom, and who can blame them. 9-11 may be five years behind us but for firefighters death on the job is a common occurrence. And that issue of mortality is only enhanced when a fellow firefighter is involved in a horrible accident and one of their own suffers a heart attack. Tommy is left to wrestle with whether or not the risk of his job is worth the reward. Being a firefighter is all he has ever known and the sense of community in the house is bone deep, but is it worth a horrific early demise? Lou contemplates moving onto a boat, Franco takes baby steps towards becoming a lieutenant and Tommy wonders if he could make it as a house husband. In the end the point seems to be that sometimes your dreams and your reality don't mix, this works out very conveniently for the show itself but it is not a false point. I also have to say that John Scurti, who plays Lou, steals the season. His uncanny resemblance to my friend Evan aside his acting is top notch and raw at the same time. With him moving in with Tommy he gets thrust into the main storyline and makes the best of it. There have been some complaints about the show going soft this year and I can see that. Tommy and his pals can whine about the PC crowd shutting down their smoking, but the show has apparently bowed to that pressure themselves as smoking on screen was drastically reduced. It is also not as hard boiled as season 1 was, and the edginess is replaced with a taste for trash. But that's OK; this show is still a hoot.",1177718400,10,3140,4.340136054421769
2796342,5,B000OIOOUU,"The third, and arguably best, season of Rescue Me may have treaded on familiar territory, but it worked out with spectacular results nonetheless.  As the season begins, Tommy (Denis Leary) is once again seperated from his wife (Andrea Roth) who still holds him responsible for the death of their son, while Tommy's uncle (Lenny Clarke) enjoys his time in prison for murder.  Jerry (Jack McGee) copes with his wife's debilitating mental health, Sean (Steven Pasquale) gets in way, way over his head with Tommy's crazy sister (Tatum O'Neal), while Franco (Daniel Sunjata) gets involved with a vendictive older woman (Susan Surandon) who plans on making him pay one way, or the other.  The main storyline of this season though is the love triangle between Tommy and his wife, as well as his cop brother (Dean Winters), which naturally as one would come to expect, doesn't end well for anybody involved.  The season reaches it's boiling point (literally) as the crew appears to go their seperate ways, and Tommy lands a golden opportunity to run away with Shelia (Callie Thorne), and everyone's future comes into question.  While there aren't as many surprises and shocks in this season as there were in the second, the third season of Rescue Me features plenty of great moments, as well as great guest roles from Sarandon and Marissa Tomei, who make the most out of their screen time.  Leary is great as well once again, while the rest of the cast performs well to boot.  All in all, Rescue Me pis undoubtedly the best original show to come out of FX since The Shield, and here's even more proof.",1176595200,29,1593,4.791970802919708

2796374,4,B000OIOOUU,"Denis Leary impresses me with his enormous talent and his riff on the stressed, mouthy, and ultimately flawed hero, Tommy Gavin. Both he and Peter Tolan have created a series that is human, comic, believable and ridiculous all at the same time - kind of like real life (only with beautiful supermodel girlfriends and wives).  If you've been watching from the Pilot episode of Season 1, then you know that Tommy has a drinking problem.  And a failing marriage.  And he is haunted by failed rescue attempts and lost loved ones.  All of that continues in this season.  More extended family members come into the picture and his relationship with Janet and the kids gets murkier.  The firehouse crew grows more eccentric and three dimensional.  It's a series about guys written by guys and it is exactly what happens when you put of bunch of working class men together in a situation where they are pledged to perform one task above all others.  The interesting take is that the show doesn't really focus on fighting fires, but it focuses on the victories and the losses of men who risk their lives for the sake of others, and the people that ebb and flow in their lives.

I did not get the chance to watch this series when it was on broadcast TV.  Now that I am viewing it in Amazon Prime, I wish that had made it a priority to watch as it unfolded in a weekly ongoing saga.  As it is, I look forward to going home and cueing up the next episode.  Another great benefit of this show?  The music.  Whoever had final say on the soundtrack did a fantastic job of matching a alternative song to the action that was unfolding on the screen.  And the Von Bondies' ""C'mon C'mon"" as the recurring theme song?  Brilliant.

I look forward to his next projects because I believe that he has a good ear for honest dialog, and he has a good handle on what makes motivates men to act as we do.",1377216000,,1876,4.406976744186046

2796387,5,B000OIOOUU,It's a good show and I find myself watching it multiple times.  Denis Leary is a great actor and he fits this role well.,1372982400,,120,4.0
2796388,5,B000OIOOUU,"This show--and Leary-- and the entire, gifted cast--will have you peeing yourself laughing one moment, but then crying weepy tears the next. It's all so HUMAN.  People behaving so badly (or so politically INcorrect one moment) then selflessly brave, then blindingly stupidly in the next scene. Yet, everything melds together into one of the truest snapshots of the human condition I've watched on television.

This review is intended for all seasons of Rescue Me, not just season three.

Premise: an NYPD firehouse crew and their families shortly after 9/11--how they all cope with, and fail to cope with, the tragedy.  But because they are human, comedy is never far from the anguish.

DO watch from episode one, season one. This is one of the great show to watch in marathon chunks--or at least two or three episodes at a time.  But you need only watch the first episode to get the itch.

And here's a fun tip for viewing: because the dialog is so witty, funny, tear-inducing, and fast-paced that you won't want to miss a bit of it, try watching with the subtitles on for the hearing-impaired. You'll be surprised how quickly you don't even notice the subtitles, but how much better you catch what everyone is saying. And you won't want to miss any dialog!

Rescue Me is one of my Top Ten TV series of all time.  I've bought copies of season one for friends and gotten them hooked.

Enjoy!",1369440000,,1391,4.68724279835391

2796391,5,B000OIOOUU,I loved this series when it was on and while there is nothing all that much more spectacular by owning it on Blu Ray it is a nice addition as I try to get rid of my standard DVD's and go all over to Blu Ray.

2796393,5,B000OIOOUU,"These shows depict the worst things that can happen to every family.  The premise could get old, but now, several seasons into Rescue Me, there still seems to be a lot of story left to tell.  Is it believable, though?  Unfortunately, for those of us who have been around long enough to know, it sure is.  People can insistently screw up their lives with scarcely an effort.  What sets this one apart, though, is the crackling dialogue in the Firehouse.  It's high drama, yes, served up with a heaping helping of sly humor.  Watch a handful from the beginning and you will be hooked.  Guaranteed.",1363478400,,595,4.6

Once again, Tommy is an emotional wreck, but he's not the only one. This season focuses on the troubles and tribulations of his entire dysfunctional family as well his fellow crew. One of the most interesting story line deals with Lou and his internal struggle after what happened to him in season 2. He is no longer the approachable nice guy that everyone can rely on. He's fighting with his problems and he's taking it out on everyone else. We also get to witness the money problem Chief Jerry faces with his physically deteriorating wife after the nursing home raises its rent.

2796414,4,B000OIOOUU,I've been a fan of this show since it first came on.  I can't tell if they've junped the shark yet because they keep throwing curves in the plot.  The characters have great dialog in the firehouse and that will keep you laughing.,1242432000,2,229,4.3023255813953485
2796415,5,B000OIOOUU,"when i bought season 3 it hit me this is the best show i have ever seen.
rich characters, excellent acting, amazing casts, great music, and  stories on topic's which only this show can do. tommy's dad's birthday
party laughed to tears, crazy maggie in full force, sean and maggie dating. susan sarandon and marisa tomei 2 of my fave actresses in the same season. alicia (susan sarandon) i knew she was up to something.
great character. loved when tommie and marisa tomei's character started
dating to make janet and marisa's ex jealous. the  episode where they went
to the  restaraunt and marisa tomei wanted to make sure the nosy waitress
taylor dayne (one of my fave singers) was hilarious. this episode was so
great. sad to see tommie's brother die,but sad to see conner die, i know all these deaths are for tommie's sake of being more of a  mess. this is
when sheila started annoying me she is too clingy, bossy, and makes tommie
a weak man. i will admit tommie and janet ate one  of the best couples
ever the chemistry is  amazing. this season is the best in my opinion
it still has comedy yet well thought out drama.",1240099200,,1122,4.502463054187192
2796416,4,B000OIOOUU,I love this show. But season 3 and 4 have still not been released in Europe. And it doesn't look likely this will happen any time soon. So when I read somewhere online reviews that this R1 dvd does play in R2 players I was so happy. The good news is ... it does. The bad news (for my deaf husband) is that there are no subtitles even though it says so in the description of the dvd. I was very pleased with the way Amazon handled it. But sad that I can not watch the show with my husband. Hopefully it will become available with subtitles soon. I adore the show! I love Dennis! One of the best shows around.,1228348800,,607,4.024793388429752

2796418,5,B000OIOOUU,"My son put me onto Rescue Me.  Over the years, I have come to rely on his opinion of various TV shows, tuning in at his suggestion and finding, always, that I fell in love with all of the shows he recommends.  Examples:  The X Files, Battlestar Gallactica, The Unit, and now, RESCUE ME.  I was never a particularly big fan of Denis Leary, although I loved him in ""The Ref.""  This year for my birthday, I received from my son Rescue Me Seasons 1 and 2.  Within just a few episodes, I was hooked!  The show is incredible -- the plots, the actors, the acting.  Denis Leary shows us a hero who has all the flaws (and then some) of every man and woman.  He is surrounded by ugly, messy, hilarious extended family members and co-workers, and just when you think the writers can't come up with anything more implausible and delightful to watch, the show takes another turn.  Through it all, Denis remains likeable, understandable, heroic, neurotic, funny, and I find myself always pulling for him, often in incredibly tragic circumstances.  This show is more like ""real life"" (only funnier) than just about anything I've seen on T.V.  I couldn't wait to get Season 3 from Amazon as soon as I finished the first two seasons.  I have now finished Seasons 3 and 4 and am waiting to catch Season 5 when the CD is released and will catch original episodes when the series starts again. As usual, my son's recommendation was spot on.  Trust me, whatever your age or sex, you're going to fall in love with RESCUE ME!",1223769600,,1502,4.474264705882353

2796420,5,B000OIOOUU,"Oh boy- where could I begin with a review for this show?  First off- the direction is impeccable; the story lines sometimes seem like they could never happen in real life, but also remember no one ever considered an attack on American soil taking out a major part of our economic infrastructure.
The crew are all too convincing in the execution of their roles.  In the midst of a 'Rescue Me' marathon (fueled by Cutty Shark and Dewer's) I found myself ready to shed tears with the cast.  That is, until I realized I was a little too drunk and was internalizing a freakin show...My advice: just buy the entire series and prepare to weep and dance with this merry gang of drunkards, womanizers, and cheaters.  It's worth the ride.",1215734400,,728,4.576923076923077

The show probably has the best character development of any show I have ever seen. I fear for the life's of the characters every week, because I will genuinely miss them when they are gone, but in this world, death comes quickly and often. Every character is ruled by his/her heart, not a lot of thinking going on with this group.",1210204800,,539,4.346534653465347

2796425,5,B000OIOOUU,My sister bought the first season for us to watch together on a drive to Kentucky. I was very skeptical at first because I didn't know much about the show however I watched the first episode and could not believe how engaged I was. The acting by Denis Leary is really wonderful and all of the cast members who play the rest of the firehouse crew make it so enjoyable. It is drama at it's very best but also HIlarious! At some moments I ams so heartbrokenly sad and there are others where I can hardly breathe I'm laughing so hard! It is a wonderful show and I would recommend it to anyone's type,1207872000,,595,4.228070175438597
2796426,5,B000OIOOUU,Excellent production and Blu-ray video quality. This year was one of the best years of Rescue Me. Watching it without commercial breaks made it seem like a riviting 4 hour movie with more impact and focus than watching week to week. I think this is the best way to see these and in the future I will skip watching the series with commercial breaks and wait for the Blu-ray. Don't miss this one.,1203292800,,394,4.410958904109589

2796431,5,B000OIOOUU,"After the second season, I didn't think things could get more difficult for these firefighters and their families.  Of course, I was wrong.
The Chief finally found some cash to pay for his wife's lodging but still struggles with her ALZ; Franco barely gets to see his daughter now that a wealthy woman has taken her away; Probie may or may not be gay and faces even more guff than he already gets from his colleagues; Lou bottoms out and ends up moving in with Tommy; another firefighter marries Tommy's nutty sister; and Tommy himself gets the brunt of the troubles with his absent-minded dad, continuing difficulties with his estranged wife, repercussions from his son's death, his brother's sudden demise, and his dealings with the increasingly demented Sheila, who drugs him in order to have her way with him--with possibly tragic results in the season finale.
Oh, and Tommy is still seeing dead people.  There are almost as many of them in his life now as real live ones.

Being a firefighter myself, this series appealed to me from the beginning but for some reason I didn't start watching it until a very good friend turned me on to it.  I have since purchased Seasons 1 & 2 and that has helped fill in some of the missing pieces as to what has happened and why.  I have told a lot of friends and coworkers about this series and they are as hooked as I am.  This is some of the best writing that exists on TV today and my helmet is off to Dennis Leary and the cast and crew.  I hope this series will air for a long time to come.

I was surprised to find that the season finale is tonight. What the hell is going on and is so important that they could have a great finale? There's nothing really to resolve.

2796452,4,B000OIOOUU,"Rescue Me has consistently been one of my favorite shows and has never been shown on free to air TV in Australia (to my knowledge). The third season is still great viewing but without as many of the intense dramatic moments that occurred in both the first two seasons that still have the effects in the third.

The show wonderfully eschews political correctness, and really engages the viewer with believable characters and dramatic conflict.

This show has some of the best quality guest artists on TV with Tatum O'Neill, Marisa Tomei and Susan Sarandon as well as many memorable lesser known characters in minor supporting roles. The only negative is the bordering on jingostic references to 911 and American patriotic fervour that don't sit so well with international audiences.

Excellent acting, clever writing, devious plotlines, killer music...it all combines for a uniquely powerful and addictive ride.

Dealing with serious subjects, everyday life, real drama and at the same time side-splitting hilarity makes 'Rescue Me' one of the best shows on TV.

I don't always appreciate the animalistic overtones given to the senseless sex and vulgaritiy and think it could be toned down a bit to make it a greater show, but it has its fans.  My job keeps me from watching it during the regular broadcast so the DVD is great plus no commercials.  I wish it was 26 Episodes as opposed to 13 to expand the story more.

Sometimes when a good series gets the recognition it deserves, it starts to change, and I wouldn't want this one to.  The cast is perfect and the writing is fearless.  They will take on any challenge in this politically correct world.  This is one of the few laugh out loud series on television anymore, and I think Dennis Leary is a genius, who hopefully will keep on giving us more.  Network television wonders why it's losing viewers.  If they made something like this to watch instead of all that reality junk we are subjected to, they would change that.

I have a Denon AVR, Monitor R90 Speakers, and a velodyne SPL-8. The HD picture quality was superior as was the audio. It is totally worth paying extra to watch the Blu-Ray over the traditional DVD. I recommend making sure your brightness and  contrast levels are set properly as not to washout colors. Also, turn your sub up a bit, it'll payoff during the action sequences. So far this show has produced 3 stellar seasons. I highly recommend Rescue Me for people who like drama mixed with clever and vulgar comedy. MUST HAVE for Dennis Leary fans.",1182988800,3,675,4.6722689075630255
