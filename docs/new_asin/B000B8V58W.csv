8083684,5,B000B8V58W,"I saw parts of this DVD in a writing class and I knew I had to have it.

8083686,5,B000B8V58W,"As a graduate of a writing program, it seems that most ""publishing tips"" are either naively enthusiastic or cynical to the point of being disheartening.  This DVD has found the line between the extremes, demystifying the publishing industry while offering advice on writing.  Finally, we can not only hear magazine editors talk about what they want from prose, but we can actually read the evidence of their choices in the digital anthology. The market listing is just as helpful as the editor/author interviews.  After watching the program, you're left with no excuse NOT to submit.",1130284800,4,583,5.11578947368421
8083687,5,B000B8V58W,"""Submit!"" features the most useful and practical advice on writing and publishing that I've ever found. You hear it straight from working editors and published writers themselves. Plus, because ""Submit!"" is in dvd format, you can easily revisit any conversation you're especially interested in -- and several are worth re-watching again and again. The advice here is more fresh and lively than dozens of how-to books.",1127001600,4,417,5.333333333333333
