I am the biggest couch potato you will find, but I love the thrill and adventure of these strong-willed, courageous men (athletes of the strongest magnitude).",1482364800,,272,4.808510638297872

8708384,5,B00UUOVQ2C,"Excellent adventure reality series by National Geographic--four teams, three seasons in all. Beautiful rugged areas in Alaska traversing over icy rivers, waterfalls, across glaciers, through forest, rain, etc. Only complaint is National Geographic cancelled Season 4 commenting that material had been depleted--can't imagine with a state as big as Alaska with with such varied terrain.",1465516800,,385,6.0181818181818185
