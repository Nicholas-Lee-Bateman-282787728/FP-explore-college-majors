5636107,5,B00BKBCDB2,"I've read that in Japan this was a boring anime and it didn't get many good reviews but here in America things are seen differently.  I recommended this anime to anyone who wants a good laugh and likes random things, with no story plot at all.  Just kick back and relax and enjoy the weirdness.",1387756800,,294,4.327272727272727

5636110,5,B00BKBCDB2,"I'm incredibly excited Sentai Works put out this set, and really rather surprised there aren't any reviews for it yet. In short, ""Kill Me Baby!"" is sweet, hilarious, malicious and cute all at the same time. The episode format is loosely connected, and there are no major dramatic themes, just fun humor surrounding individually isolated adventures. It has great characters, quick wit, and won't disappoint- I promise.",1372896000,11,417,5.2388059701492535

These two make a great comedy duo and I really enjoyed watching their interactions lead to very funny punchlines",1493078400,,136,4.956521739130435
8569941,5,B00BKBCDB2,"I think this anime is hilarious. Yasuna is a riot! She and Sonya have such a cute chemistry together which makes every episode incredibly enjoyable. Agiri is great too and I can't help but love Unused Character as well. All the characters are so lovable. It is also nice to have ""no credits"" versions of the opening and ending songs.",1465516800,,333,4.566666666666666

8569945,4,B00BKBCDB2,"They best way I could describe this show is it's basically Azumanga Daioh, if it had assassins. This is very much a slice of life anime, so if you don't like that, leave now.

Audio: The music is very basic, with the exceptions of the op and ed (opening and ending) songs. Those are very catchy, and I find myself occasionally listening to them on repeat. I can't speak for the Japanese Voices, but the English voice cast is very good. If you are a fan of Sentai Works, you may find you recognize some of the voices from some other anime, but other than that, the voices fit the characters well, with Yasuna being a pretty stupid mischief maker, Sonya being a trained assassin that doesn't take any crap, and Agiri sounding ditsy and airheaded, but at times, serious, giving you the impression she's just playing the part of the fool.

Visuals: The visuals can go from Good to very Bare Bones, but for the genre this anime is, (Slice-of-Life/Comedy) it's not that big of a deal. Still, some hardcore anime enthusiasts may find this a bit irritating. If you're used to the quality of Clannad and Angel Beats, this show might be a letdown for you visual-wise. But if you're thinking about buying this, you're not here for the animation.  You're here for the...

Comedy: This show has a very dark style of comedy. If you're not sure this show is for you, watch Azumanga Daioh or Lucky Star and something like Game Grumps, and, if you didn't like those shows, you probably won't like this either. Most of the comedy comes from Yasuna doing something stupid, and the other characters acting upon that, usually Sonya beating up Yasuna, with the occasional appearance of Agiri, with a nonsensical gadget that is entertaining for a few minutes. I personally wish Agiri got more screentime, as she is an unpredictable and funny character, and I found I laughed the most when she was on screen, but you can't win them all I guess.

In conclusion, I give this anime 4/5 mainly for it's comedy. Again I can't stress enough that if you don't like the comedy, this show will seem utterly mundane. Go watch some clips on YT before you make your decision.",1411257600,3,2139,4.5744125326370755
8569946,5,B00BKBCDB2,"Kill Me Baby is a comedy, filled with short stories that don't always related to the previous stories. If you love non-cohesiveness episodes and whacked out silliness, this series is for you. I enjoyed the fact that a typical normal high schooler (yes, they are in high school despite the fact that they look like they are in elementary school) is best friends with an assassin. The ninja seemed to be over-kill but in all, this made me smile. There were some jokes I didn't get because they only make sense in Japan but in all, I felt like this was a solid piece to purchase and to have in my Anime collection. Sentai did a good job on the dub as well.",1410652800,,653,4.317073170731708
