This video series succeeds in providing that invitation by crafting the outlet for such expression into channels aligned with Divine origins.  By accessing and understanding the powers of the archetypal Goddesses, in association with their full range of emotional expression, women are not only empowered to feel deeply, but to hold that emotional knowing within their bodies as a wellspring from which to express.
  Rose clearly asserts from the beginning that true feminine power lies not in fear and destruction, but in Understanding and Transformation.  She demonstrates that by understanding the cosmos as networks of subtle energies, we can consciously channel spiritual energy through these pathways and enrich our beings on a very personal level.  In this way can women make contact with their Inner Power, Sensuality, Grace, Compassion, and Love.  This naturally then generates the Divine Pride that comes in the expression of such qualities.
  Through these three videos, each viewer is facilitated to tap into her own Compassion and Love, her:  Majesty, Ferocity, Passivity, Sensuality, Intoxification, Determinedness, Playfulness, her own Passion.  In short, women are encouraged and given techniques in becoming more fully Alive.  In each realm: fiery Power, Love and Compassion, or Sensuality, women are given meditation and movement techniques which carry the potential to penetrate to the core of the being.
 In many of todays societies, in contrast, women have been conditioned to believe that the highest spiritual behavior is associated with humility and obedience; an attitude of remaining humble to the authorities which lie outside the self.  This attitude can be traced down from a hierarchy which places one powerful male God  above man, above woman--and that the rules by which to live must, thus, be fashioned in a similar manner.  Within this video series, however, we are given a different option.
  In recalling the images and energies of the ancient Goddesses:  Isis, Tara, Quan Yin,  and others, we are provided with a different possibility of a way of being.  It is one that ultimately points to the wisdom of your own Self.  Thus, it is by going within that one may find the answers to their deepest questions.  By tending to one's feelings,  and crafting the channel of their expression, the truths that lie within can be effectively channeled outwards.
 Channeling is actually what seems to take place in these videos as the eloquence, power and truth of the words which flow from Sharron Rose's mouth penetrate deeply into the psyche/the soul of the viewer--as though the Ancient Goddess has arrived to directly carry forth her message.
 In these troublesome days, we, with the growing awareness of ourselves as planetary citizens, are seeking peaceful solutions to pervasive problems.  Validating and empowering creative feminine expression--rather than silencing it, medicating it, or rejecting it, may well prove a powerful means of transformation.  Women must first hone it within themselves, in order to become fully present to the energy they are capable of holding.  This video series provides the means by which to tap this.
 I most highly recommend it.",976060800,5,3316,5.260952380952381
