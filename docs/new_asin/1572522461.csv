7797903,5,1572522461,I happen to be one of the Tarot readers in Tarot part of this show. We made the show in 1995 for the Learning Channel and Discovery Channel. I have the videos.  It''s nice to have the DVD. Thanks.,1438732800,4,196,4.0256410256410255
7797904,5,1572522461,"Tarot and Astrology demonstrated and narrated by the great film actor Christopher Lee.  What can I?  It's absolutely delightful!!  I hope Mr. Lee does more in this series.  His voice, alone, is mesmerizing.",1398988800,3,206,5.151515151515151
7797905,5,1572522461,"First of all, a documentary that is entirely narrated by Christopher Lee? That alone makes it worthwhile. This is a really in-depth look at Tarot reading and astrology and makes you realize just how intricate these two techniques really are. It also gets into their histories (what's known about them anyway, Tarot's history is as mysterious as the technique itself) and is all and all a very interesting watch.

Even if you are a skeptic, you may still enjoy this set. Of course, if you really get angry about this kind of stuff then you might not be interested.",1277596800,8,563,4.686868686868687
7797906,5,1572522461,"This ridiculous video makes a mockery of astrology and Tarot. There is a constant background noise of weird, ""spooky"" music, and an incredible over-use of fake mist to make things look occult-ish. The narrator uses a dramatic, rather hushed tone of voice which I assume is supposed to sound witchy or something. It's so full of stupid hype, I almost expected Dracula to make an appearance in a cape and fake vampire fangs! Yes, it's that corney. This video is also an embarassment to real astrologers and Tarot readers and an utter waste of money.",1223596800,8,547,4.768421052631579
7797907,5,1572522461,"""Strictly Supernatural"" is a refreshing change of pace from the typical tarot, oracle and astrology DVD, which tends to focus on the ""strictly scientific"" aspect of these practices.

And Christopher Lee adds credibility!",1151020800,9,220,5.666666666666667
7797908,3,1572522461,"Christopher Lee narrates just over 11/2 hour doco on astrology and Tarot - covers the basics on how a natal chart is cast and how astrological advice has been used in recent history by the likes of Ronald Reagan, Hitler and John F Kennedy.
Tarot section covers the 22 card Major Arcana but doesn't mention much of swords, cups, wands or pentacles or their relationship to present day playing cards. Interesting interviews with parctitioners of these arts as well as  balanced comments from critics such as parapsychologists, astronomers and professors of logic and philosophy. Stuart Caplan, credited with the commercial introduction of Tarot cards into the US, is also interviewed and mention is made of the links between Tarot, Kabbalah and Astrology , the fundamentals of which were explored by the Golden Dawn and the notorious Mr Aleister Crowley.
Overall a well presented feature obviously shot for TV with a reasonable video and basic stereo soundtrack. Extras are absent which is a pity - some examples from Mr Caplan's fabulous collection of Tarot decks would have been of great interest.",1023580800,47,1097,5.094444444444444
