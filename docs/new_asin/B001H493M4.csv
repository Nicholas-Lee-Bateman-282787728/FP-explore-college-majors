NOT THIS DVD VIDEO.

It will not function on ANY of my 4 Blu-Ray DVD players; even the REGION-FREE/CODE FREE units.

I'm not sure why AMAZON is selling this as Amazon usually provides for great service.

3622792,5,B001H493M4,"12/03/2008:
I bought this disc from Amazon in the UK. It didn't say that it was blu-ray region B (Europe), and since many music blu-ray discs are region free, I kept my fingers crossed. When I got the disc it didn't play on my region A (Americas) player. However, it doesn't say anything about any region on the disc or on the box.

As Girls Aloud are fairly unknown in the US, I doubt that they would make a region A disc for release here. Since the Amazon.com product description says region 1, which is the region term used for DVDs, not blu-rays, and three customers have received unplayable discs, I think it's fair to assume that this information is incorrect, and that these discs are in fact region B, imported from Europe. Too bad.

UPDATE 12/27/2009:
It's now a year later and I decided to try the disk again. Now it works! Either a firmware upgrade for my Samsung BD-P2500 did it or the fact that I bought a new TV (Panasonic TC-P58V10). However, when I originally bought the disc, I tried it on 4 different systems, including a PS3 and a setup at Best Buy. The disc didn't work anywhere. I'm really happy that it works now. The show is amazing. I had to wait a year but it was worth it.",1232755200,5,1198,4.34375

Also I have purchased 2nd Blu-ray days ago, BUT NO LUCK, still can't play on my PS3 (it skip from title 1 to 2 repeatly).",1230076800,,386,4.078947368421052
3622796,4,B001H493M4,"Girls Aloud's 5th DVD release is a gem indeed but it is flawed non the less.
1.) The show opens with a very grand and dramatic ""flying in"" from the ceiling. The opening is long but worth it as Sexy(no,no,no) begins with Cheryl's now famous auto-tune and BAM! it hits you Nadine's vocals and the dancing are great and a very good way to kick off the show.
2.)Girl Overboard- This is great and the girls are still very high energy.
3.)Sound Of The Underground-Unfortunately this is where things start to taper off a little, and they should not this early in the show and NOT with GA's signiture song. The girls barely dance and sit on thier very toned male dancers and let them do the work. One thing you'll see me complian about for almost this whole DVD is the SOUND QUAILTY and the DUBBING, both of which are the low points on the DVD. The sound for SOTU is terrible you can barely hear them and the music is also too low. Other than that it's ok.
4.)Close to Love- By stark contrast to what I said above on this song the sound was GREAT and the girls were up and dancing. The little dance break at the end is great as well.
5.)Can't Speak French- The girls enter after a costume change (covered by the dancers very nice routine)and proceed into the song. The song it's self is great AGAIN the Sound quaity is not as some members are heard far better than others(ex: You can't really hear Nadine but Kimberly and Cheryl are well heard)the band once again are also way too soft.
6.)Love Machine-Cute song with high engery dancing by the ladies and much better sound.
7.)Black Jacks-Here we go again! The sound is bad, the very obvious dubbing is worse and the dancing is low energy. Nice song at least though.
8.)Biology-For one of GA's biggest hits they really messed up big time! The sound is so low you have to turn on the volume quite loud to really hear it, the band is playing like they don't care and worst of all the terrible dubbing. The girls can be heard singing the chorus wrong and it is badly dubbed over with the correct album version. Such a shame to wreck such a huge hit and great song.
9.)Whole Lotta History-After another costume change the girls one by one emgerge onto a wired bridge to take them to thier ""B'stage""( a smaller 2nd stage in the middle of the arena)very nice live vocals and though the band is quite low it's not as bad as previous songs.
10.)With Every Heartbeat- The girls are on the B'stage and sing 2 songs there this is the first. It is a nice if very slow slow song with great vocals by all.
11.) I'll Stand By You- Nice emotional song with great performance by the girls but again not by the band.
12.)Fling-After yet another costume change the girls do a short skit and then come out swinging on this one and the band actualy sounded like they had a job to do and so it well this time.
13.)Push it (Salt N Pepper cover- The girls really impressed me on this one! Cheryl takes charge on this as she comands the opening and most of the song. Nadine and Sarah also add great presence vocally. Great dancing as well.
14.)Wake Me Up/Walk This Way- The ladies mix one of their own and another cver together with well.. mixed results(IMO). Wake me up was quite dissapointing frankly as both the girls and the band were low energy and not memorable. Walk this way was a little better but not that much.
15.) Control of The Knife- AH yes My fav song off of Tangled Up is done and done RIGHT! Cheryl takes over both the singing and dancing in an amazing (IMO) performance. Cheryl's dancing during the dance break and the little mini cover of ""Trick Me"" by Kelis thrown in there(which some say was a threat to Ashley but who knows)was nothing short of greatness.(IMO).
16.)Call The Shots- A very Good performance by all. Nicola really shines here though as her bridge part is the center of it all. Great timed Piro with it as well I must say I LOVE the piro on this DVD it was very well timed and done.
17.)Jump- Very high energy performance by the girls not as much from the band but they still managed to redeem themselves from earlier mess ups.
18.)Something Kinda OOH- Last song of the night and to close it out the ladies go all out! One more costume change(5 in all) and a very dark dramatic opening to the song much like how the show started. After that and some more piro the girls launch into it. This was another dissapointment as the girls were clearly a little nervous and very tired. The band called it a night as well and for such a thumping bass ridden club hit there was liitle to be heard. The band almost could have walked off the stage and you wouldn't have noticed. Not a good way to close it out at all. The ending glitter and piro was nice though. All in all Tangled Up live from the 02 is a good one that had the potential to be great if not for sound,dubbing and sometimes crappy editing. A GA fan MUST Have anyway! Warning!!! THIS IS A PAL DVD NOT NTSC AS AMAZON SAYS!!!!!!! IF YOU HAVE A REGION FREE DVD PLAYER OR PORTABLE THEN FINE IF NOT,IT WILL WORK ON YOUR COMPUTER AS COMPUTERS HAVE NO REGION CODES!!!",1267574400,2,5066,4.316894018887723
3622797,5,B001H493M4,The blu ray plays flawlessly on my oppo bdp-83 player. The show is fantastic and the blu ray quality is pretty good both picture and sound. Reccomended!,1266883200,,152,4.666666666666667
3622798,3,B001H493M4,"Not too bad, but not great as is the Out of Control tour concert--the sound isn't as well done (mixed; vocals could be cranked up a little more) and the show in general is not as visually entertaining as the Out of Control concert video.  In other words, if you are going to buy only one Girls Aloud concert video, I recommend the Out of Control concert live at the O2 instead of this one.  Unless you must have the songs featured in this concert instead I suppose...  Nevertheless, this is still pretty good, although in hindsight I probably wouldn't have purchased it.  But I just had to find out what format this came in to see if it would play on my North American PS3.  Doesn't the listing say NTSC, and isn't that what I want?  Anyway, the one I received is in PAL format and my PS3 will not play it.  My PC will play it though...",1263427200,3,836,4.220125786163522
3622799,5,B001H493M4,"2 words - Love it. It took some time for a version like this to be released in the US, but sure glad that it finally did.
They are not so popular here in the US but I hope one day that they would make a good splash here. So, for folks like me who enjoys GA but don't have the financial resources to fly to the UK and Europe to see them. This is a good chance to watch them perform.

3622800,1,B001H493M4,"The description says NTSC, one of the reviewers marked it as non-regional.  I ordered a copy from CD Imports and it is PAL.  Buyer beware! Unfortunately I opened the DVD and it is now non-returnable.  Ebay, here I come!",1251504000,,219,4.564102564102564

I bought this item on Amazon.ca, not on the USA one and it works fine... No problem at all. Now, I don't have a PS3 console, so I can't say about it... But as for my Sony BDP-S350 blu-ray player, I had no problem. I came here just to tell you guys this. Hope I helped.",1249776000,,444,3.9444444444444446
3622802,5,B001H493M4,"I first discovered Girls Aloud several months ago untill recently when I saw them on YouTube.  This concert DVD, filmed at London's 02, is something extraordinary.  Supporting their ""Tangled Up"" album, the show offers great performances for nearly 2 hours. It begins with their 'flying' stunt followed by their album's first single, ""SEXY! NO NO NO..."". On the plus side, the DVD also includes the 3 music videos normally aired on European TV.  Just want to assure every American pop fan that this DVD will play on US DVD players, especially portables, despite the PAL format, and it is region-free.  When you get the chance, if it's still available, buy it.  You'll be amazed!",1245974400,3,677,4.9035087719298245
3622803,5,B001H493M4,"Girls Aloud live shows are fantastic, this is probably my favorite concert of theirs thus far. However, I've yet to see Out of Control. Waiting for that DVD! =) Every song on here is energetic and entertaining. The girls kill it w/ Fling, Sexy! No No No, Love Machine... The list goes on. I was blown away by every single song. I was surprised by Control of the Knife, I must admit I didn't care for that particular song but then I see it live and just, wow! The girls bring their A-game! The Black Jacks performance is really good too, the dancing is great. I love the behind the scenes doc, very cute. Just make sure your DVD player can play PAL or Region 0 discs, otherwise you probably won't be able to watch this DVD. I tried searching for this DVD as a Region 1 (bc I live in the United States. *sigh* I wish the girls would come over here!), but I could not find it. So yes, make sure you can play this product before purchasing. But overall, yes yes yes buy this DVD!!!",1245888000,,977,4.202127659574468
3622804,4,B001H493M4,"The blu-ray of the Girls Aloud version ,as others have stated, is problematic with certin blu-ray players. I have the Pioneer 51d and it will play the disc,but only when I change the output select from hdmi,and the display on the player shows that it is 50hertz,which is a pal format, then it will only play the program in black and white since the 51d does not have a pal to ntsc converter built in,now to make this more confusing the Samsung 1500 I have will play this disc with no problem at all,which makes me wonder if the samsung players are software free of  the a-b reigon codes of blu ray discs.

It is part her morning routine to get her out the door for school and when she gets home from school, she will wind-down by watching a bit of the DVD before she tackles her homework studies. The songs are very upbeat and the body images of the band members are a good influence of keeping my daughter's body image in check and reminds her not to lose her strong flat abdomen, while at the same time, it shows her how to be feminine instead of a tomboy.",1362441600,,652,4.141732283464567

For certain numbers you hear the BAND & GIRLS ALOUD ,would just have to scream the lyrics out. And of course it also worked the other way!
