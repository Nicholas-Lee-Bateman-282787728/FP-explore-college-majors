8469027,5,B005ETANSQ,"Riveting, informative, human account and expose of the disgraceful and dishonorable U.S. American military's abandonment of what is today as many as 250,000 first and second generation stranded, estranged or orphaned biracial Amerasians in the Philippines. Unlike Vietnam, the U.S. has done nearly nil  to ease immigration policies allowing military Filipino Amerasians to claim their rightful citizenship in the homeland of their often irresponsible service member or corporate contractor fathers who sired these children often with profoundly poor Filipina national moms. Madame Emma Rossi Landi & Company have performed an invaluable public service, producing an excellent and authoritative account updating the current status of our Amerasian brothers and sisters... hapless victims of a global war policy not of their making. The film should be mandatory viewing for every employee of the U.S. Embassy in Manila and the U.S. Defense and State Departments.",1440547200,,960,5.76056338028169
8469028,5,B005ETANSQ,"This high definition, skillfully directed quality film is highly recommended for those Americans unaware of the human misery and travail left by the U.S. military (mostly Navy, Marines & Air Force), federal civilian employees and private defense contractors during their long standing occupancy of permanent bases dating to the Philippine American War, aka Filipino Insurrection (1899-1902). An estimated 50,000+ mixed heritage, biracial military 'Amerasians,' including those of Black (African), White (Anglo), Hispanic (Latino and Chicano) and Native American origin, were abandoned or stranded when U.S. bases were forced to leave Luzon in 1992; in reality the number of infants and toddlers, now in early adulthood, left stranded by U.S. fathers was probably far greater! The Italian film producers have done a superb job documenting the lives of four Amerasians who struggle to this day with issues of identity confusion, stigmatization and discrimination, complicated grief and loss and psychosocial physical risk factors including homelessness, alcohol abuse and family dysfunction. Many of these problems are graphically exhibited by the four subjects in the film. Directors Rossi Landi & Vendemmiati should be commended for taking on a subject which Americans, if they take time to view the film, would be both surprised and much ashamed of.  Signed: Dr. P.C.
