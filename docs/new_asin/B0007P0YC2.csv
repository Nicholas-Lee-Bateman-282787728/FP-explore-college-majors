8250917,5,B0007P0YC2,"I am a huge fan of the late Yvonne DeCarlo,so when I came across this title I was very excited. Ms. DeCarlo appears in the movie ""PLAY DEAD"" in which she gets her rottweiler to do her evil bidding. As with the other two titles included,""DEATH BY DIALOGUE"" and ""MOMMY'S EPITAPH"" all three films are pretty campy(in my opinion).They are all very gorey and bloody especially the latter two titles. I enjoyed all three films but I honestly purchased this due to the fact that it included a movie with Yvonne in it. I only wish that more of her movies were released on dvd!",1175212800,3,568,4.419047619047619
