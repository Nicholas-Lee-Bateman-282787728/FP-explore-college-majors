It was the 3rd DVD to the last of this season, which was one of the best battles and story line in this season. Other than that, everything was a great.",1354147200,,270,4.313725490196078
2436453,3,B000BPL2IS,"Everyone is likely aware of what the series is about at this point, if not, allow me to paraphrase. Season 1 contains the introduction of the protagonist Kenshin, a very skilled swordsman who participates in many battles throughout. This season (picks up at volume 7 in the manga) is really where the series becomes legendary. So many new phenomenal characters are introduced, and many great battles are witnessed. These episodes are well worth the money.....however, I personally do not care for this particular set at all. The set contains like 8 discs on a long spindle within the casing. I know a lot of people complain about this because they dislike the extra effort it takes to pull out a disk from within the pile, or even to replace the disk they just finished watching with the next one, placing it on the very bottom. Don't get me wrong, I also believe this would be annoying, but my problem is far greater. After I remove the discs from the spindle, they 1) literally will not even begin to play in my dvd player; or 2) play with waning quality, usually suffering from a distortion/lag effect. I do not see any other reviews that complain of this problem, which leads me to believe that something is wrong with the way I remove them, because this isn't the 1st time I've experienced this problem. In 2 other cases, I've tried the same style casing, and every time the result is the same, for all of the reviews on amazon, it is never even hinted upon. One of the two other cases was this very product; I re-ordered it because I love this series, and honestly wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt, that the first set I bought was simply defective, but it appears that isn't the case, and at this point, I am out of ideas....if anyone can help, I would certainly appreciate it.",1346457600,,1793,4.52

2436455,5,B000BPL2IS,"Season 2 is a must have for fans of Rurouni Kenshin and Samurai X, where season 1 introduced all the characters, season 2 is where the action starts! I recommened this season to anyone who just enjoys a good action/samurai/historical type anime. I wouldn't watch this season without first watching season 1 though, you'll miss alot of important character development.",1338854400,,367,5.133333333333334
2436456,1,B000BPL2IS,"The series that the company ended up sending me was series three, which i already have. When i contacted them, they said ""sorry we don't have series two (the one i ordered) in stock"". What the hell!",1291248000,,198,4.378378378378378
2436457,5,B000BPL2IS,If You have seen Samurai x  You'll love this action packed season of rurouni Kenshin. I have seen Samurai x and urouni Kenshin season one this second season was excellent the show just keeps getting better!...I definitely recommend this series to any one who is looking for an anime based on post samurai days after the revolution. This series is one of the best i've seen! Full of values and morals.,1275609600,,400,4.633802816901408
2436458,4,B000BPL2IS,"There are already a number of reviews here praising the Kyoto arc of Rurouni Kenshin, so I'm not going to dwell on how great this arc is.  It is visually stunning, emotional, and supplies some of the greatest antagonists of any anime.  It should serve as an example to compare all other swordsman titles to.  That said, the dvd set itself could have been better.

The Extras in this set are pretty lackluster.  You get translation notes for some of the historical Japanese terminology, creditless OP/ED, and a blooper reel.  The blooper reel isn't nearly as fun as the ones that ADV typically puts out.  It's just a lot of scenes where the dub cast flubbed their lines.  Not that entertaining, though hearing ""Jigen"" stumble all over while trying to say ""Ama-Kakeru-Ryu-No-Hirameki"" is pretty entertaining.

Speaking of the dub voice cast.  Eh, I'm not incredibly impressed with the dub of this series.  It feels pretty phoned in at times.  The Japanese cast really conveyed great emotion through their voices that the English cast just didn't replicate all that well.

Another thing to note is that the ""Sobakasu"" opening is used and not the translated ""Freckles"" song.

Video is crisp and clear.  The translation is pretty decent.  They definitely tamed the profane language a bit.  Chou's swearing doesn't come across in the subtitles at all, for instance.  I personally dislike ""de gozaru"" being translated into ""that I know.""  There just isn't a logical way to take a manner of speaking (""de gozaimasu"" being a masculine phrase commonly used by samurai) like that and translate it into something in English, so just leave well enough alone.  It's like taking someone who refers to themselves with ""Ore"" and saying ""I, punk so and so....""  It just does not translate period.

But I digress, this is just a small complaint.  I suggest that everyone picks up this series on dvd.  It's worth it just to see the animation with such crisp quality.",1270512000,,1946,4.862804878048781
2436459,5,B000BPL2IS,"I am not an expert at animes but from what I have heard people in Japan consider this one of the best. I just randomly stumbled on it years ago on Cartoon Network and was hooked ever since. Season 2 (this one) is by far the best. I recommend seeing season 1 first just to get the character backgrounds, but season 2 is just so good. Excellent storyline through and through. Season 3 is not worth your money unless you're a huge fan like me. It is the worst of the seasons, but is still ok if you're a major fan. If you can only buy one, buy season 2.",1268265600,,550,4.009090909090909
2436460,5,B000BPL2IS,"Complete season two. High quality with a good translation, English dubbed or Japanese with subtitles. Its a bit annoying how Kenshin speaks half the time (in the subtitles) , ""I will go with you, that I will"" is an example. But since it it not the case when he gets serious or with any of the other characters at any time, I'm sure its done with good reason. It stopped bothering me after the first few episodes. There are tons of extras including linear notes which explains the context and history of what happens in the series. For example if there is a reference to the Boshin Wars then the linear notes will provide a short history of it to help you understand Kenshin's context. Extra's also include fanart etc. A really good buy if you are a fan.",1263254400,,753,4.424460431654676
2436461,5,B000BPL2IS,"I really enjoyed season 2 of rurouni kenshin. it was great, but i think the best the best thing about it is that it got 2 me so fast. it was unbelievable. I was very pleased with the price, service, and quality.",1260835200,,211,4.0476190476190474
2436462,5,B000BPL2IS,"im a big fan of the rouniken series ever since i read the manga. it was great. and then i saw the show a long time ago on cartoon network and thought it was a great adaptation. but when we got to season 2, everything i saw before in season one paled in comparison. in this season you get more vinteresting villans, heroes and comedy. as well as one of the most deadly and admired villans in the series and anime, makoto shishio. this series is more complex, has more action and a deeper sense of story telling. i reccomend it for any fan or anime enthusiasts. in this set you get 35 episodes in an economy box. but beware, the only down side to this buy is the box itself. its frail and can break, so handle with care or move the discs to some where more safe. happy viewing!",1223337600,,775,4.139072847682119
2436463,5,B000BPL2IS,"I bought the first season of Rurouni Kenshin and was rather drawn between liking and disliking it - season 1 stuck to the manga version pretty closely for half the season, but the filler episodes about killed me...

After purchasing and watching the second season of RK, I just about died of happiness. The Kyoto arc really does follow the manga rather well, and for that I was most ecstatic. Each episode was packed with amazing animation, beautiful artwork, thrilling stories, and marvelous dialogue. I highly recommend this season/box set to Rurouni Kenshin fans!",1220659200,,566,5.0212765957446805
2436464,5,B000BPL2IS,"Season Two is much better than Season One, which was good, but two involves more action, intrigue and adventure.  I think this series is appropriate for older children, although there are people killed by swords, and blood appears in a cartoony way, but it teaches good morals and offers lessons in being strong and kind.  (You don't get much morality in modern American cartoons...)  If you like classic samurai movies, you will like this.  It's quite thoughtful.  But be careful where and how you buy this multi-dvd set, because mine largely fell out of the case when opened, and won't fix on their little holders, and two out of eight so far either won't play or are a struggle and freeze up.  It's worth any difficulty though.  I'm going to buy it again until I get a workable set!  Very bad production quality on this!",1217894400,,823,4.627586206896551

2436469,5,B000BPL2IS,"The Economy Box set of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" Season 2 is well worth the price.  It is far cheaper than the $139.99 original box set of the Kyoto Arc.

There are 8 discs (which I found to be a surprise).  The discs are the same as the ones you would get if you purchased the more expensive version (they are identical in all respects except for the ""Rurouni Kenshin"" logo on the disc itself which has been changed to fit the style of the graphic novels).  The box is unlike the original set and there are no special sleeves to hold the discs.  The box for the economy set is basically an oversized DVD box.

A minor flaw was the packaging of the discs.  They overlapped in two parts of the box (which made them more susceptible to scratches) and some were difficult to remove and put back.

If you've seen the show and know the story, skip the following paragraphs.

The story follows Kenshin and his journey to stop the madman Shishio Makoto from gaining control of Japan.  Main and secondary characters get larger roles and new ones are introduced.

The action scenes are well done.  The best one, by far, is the fight between Kenshin and Saito Hajime (of the Shinsengumi) in the episodes after the beginning of the season.

The one thing that may bother new fans is the inconsistency of the animation.  I have read that there were ""guest artists"" who lended their skills to a batch of episodes every now and then.  The results are sometimes subtle, but in some they are very apparent and distracting.  Because you get used to the initial style, the transition becomes rather annoying.  Besides the art style changing, the quality of the animation also varies at specific times.  The Kenshin-Saito fight and ensuing episode have an apparent animation differences from the other episodes:  they're more detailed and flow beautifully.  Though this is a good thing, the abrupt change to a slightly lower quality animation in the following episode is displeasing.

Overall, the economy box is worth purchase.  It has a good price and the second season of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" is darker, more enjoyable, and one of the reasons this series is known as a classic.",1143158400,,2150,4.677333333333333
2436470,5,B000BPL2IS,"First off I have to say that I'm a big Kenshin fan, best anime series in my opinion, with Inuyasha following close behind. This DVD set was awesome the menu's, extra's, and all the rest were all nicely done and I loved it. If you are a true Kenshin, Japan, or Samurai lover then this DVD set will be sure to fill you with hours of none stop action and thrills. This story line was in my opinion one of the best, the bad guy was one of Kenshin's hardest battles pushing him to the brink of death and back. In this story the relationship between Kenshin and Kaoru reaches its peak, with both of them realizing what they really mean to each other. So I give this DVD set 5 out of 5(lol, I would give it a 6 but it will not let me go that high)",1140393600,2,740,3.9731543624161074

Rurouni Kenshin Season 2 Media Blaster Dub (The better of the 2 english dubs)

Physical condition of product:

I am a huge fan of the Rurouni Kenshin series. I have all 28 manga and all Samurai X movies. I have season 1 and 3, and now season 2 as well. The issue I have is that the condition of both the DVD set case and the last DVD in the set were poor. Now, I know issues can occur during shipping, but this is obviously not from shipping. The plastic on the front of the case was pealing off, and the disc on the inside was scratched. Luckily it still plays. Had it not played I would have asked for a refund. I didn't spend 130 bucks for a product in poor condition. I would buy this product from another seller if possible. If not, be warned that you may end up with something in poor condition.

Content:

Now as for the content, this is the best season of Rurouni Kenshin, hands down! If you have never seen it, you are in for a real treat! This is why I love this anime! The fights are amazing and the storyline is great! If you have read the manga series, it follows vol. 7 - vol. 17 (roughly give or take). The soundtrack is amazing and the voice acting is some of the best I have ever seen in anime.

Final Verdict:

Great product, just poor condition of packaging and last disc. I would say find another seller, but if this is the only seller you can find, I say go for it. Rurouni Kenshin is the best anime I have ever seen, and it's well worth the money.",1398816000,2,1492,4.089041095890411
8090774,5,B000BPL2IS,"Rurouni Kenshin is a great Anime. There are fighting scenes in almost every episode, deep stories, and XXX (what's the word for ""you want to see what's going to happen in the next episode""?). On top of this, there is a touch of humour as well.
