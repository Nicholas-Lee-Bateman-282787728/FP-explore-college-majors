4174891,5,B003R0MEKO,"This is certainly an uneven season for one of the '80's great soaps, but when it's going well, it's great. Jane Wyman is superb, as usual. This season begins making the point that Wyman's Angela Channing is not the show's villain, as viewers were initially led to believe. She's the one trying to hold on to her family's heritage, and her strength begins to show. Other characters are coming into their own, as well, and that's why the season is, despite the poor story line on the German treasure hunt, can be forgiven. Bring on seasons 5-9!",1473206400,3,542,4.597938144329897

4174893,5,B003R0MEKO,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Season 4 after reading several reviews about it. Many of the original fans of the show seemed to love season 3 and dislike season 4 but I disagree with this completely. Now I had never seen this show before until just recently and decided to binge watch the first four seasons since they are all available on Amazon, and I found season 4 to be the best so far. I loved the Cartel story line that so many disliked for some reason; I'm not sure why because I found it very exciting and enjoyed watching every gripping episode. I can't wait to begin to watch season 5 now.",1471824000,4,609,4.258620689655173
