8752907,5,B01CF83N8A,This is a great dvd for anyone who studies or is interested in studying Naihanchi Shodan. There are various applications provided for each movement from beginning to end. This is an especially valuable training tool for someone like myself who needs to review the same material several times in order to get the finer details. Another benefit of having so many quality technical applications is that it leads you to be creative and towards the ultimate goal of making the kata your own and creating your own variations of the applications.,1457827200,,539,4.934065934065934
8752908,5,B01CF83N8A,There is so much great material covered in this DVD!  If Naihanchi is a kata that is part of your tradition or you want to cross train to gain insight into your own art this DVD is for you. It covers many practical applications and drills that flow with the kata perfectly. I personally have had the opportunity to train with Sensei Poage at a seminar a couple years ago. He is a great martial artist and his mastery of the material he presents is obvious. I have felt his techniques and they are spot on! Can't recommend his material enough. Check out his Waza Wednesday channel on Youtube and you will understand why this will be a purchase you will not regret.,1457395200,,663,4.390243902439025
8752909,5,B01CF83N8A,I have been studying the Naihanchi kata since 1974 and this instructional dvd is the best I have seen. Everything depicted in the dvd is grounded in reality and covers applications for each and every movement in the kata. This dvd holds the top spot in my collection of reference materials regarding this kata and martial arts in general.,1457395200,,338,4.745762711864407
