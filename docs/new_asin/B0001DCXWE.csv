8010305,3,B0001DCXWE,"I gave this one an okay rating for one reason. The reason being, in order to hear the movie I had to pump up the volume to an obscene level. Once at that level it sounded fine. I had originally rented this movie way back in the days of the VHS rentals. I enjoyed it then and I still enjoy it today.",1435881600,,298,3.8225806451612905

8010308,3,B0001DCXWE,"It's not the best movie I've ever watched, but it'll do.  There's lots of action & bullets flying just like there should be in all action movies & you gotta respect the guys who take on these dangerous missions.  I thought Jan Michael Vincent was the star of the movie, but his role was more of a supporting role.  The character he played turned out to be a bad guy in the end & he lost his life because of it.  Well, I guess you can't always be the hero.",1353715200,,455,4.022222222222222
8010309,1,B0001DCXWE,"Jan Michael Vincent at his worst! Terrible acting (not just Vincent but all the cast), lousy music score and sound effects! One half hour into it was all I could take! This one went into the round file without any regrets!",1219881600,,222,4.439024390243903
8010310,4,B0001DCXWE,"I watched this movies back 1992 on a tape but this DVd missed the starting
of the movies when they was testing the sergeant in the military camp
for shooting stimulated targets before sending him for the call of duty
that part was nice but transfering and old VHS with the whole ORIGINAL
MOVIE INTO DVD IS NOT EASY BECAUSE I REMEMBERED THIS MOVIE WAS VERY
LONG. Good movie I rated it four stars for some missing part",1211587200,2,416,4.346153846153846
