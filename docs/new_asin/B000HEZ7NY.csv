2637046,5,B000HEZ7NY,"If you like British Comedy with a little class, try ""Waiting For God"". It's funny and silly as you would expect from British Comedy, however, there is a message that comes through loud and clear within each episode. Hopefully, we all live long enough to be considered ""old age"".",1249603200,,278,4.6938775510204085
2637047,5,B000HEZ7NY,I started watching Waiting for God on my local PBS station and missed it terribly when it was taken off due to budget cuts.  Thanks to Amazon and BBC America I can see it anytime at home.  What I like most about the series is that it's about older people and the funny situations they get into and how they deal with it.  I've stopped watching network TV sitcoms because they're empty and devoid of real comedy.  I'm tired of seeing pretty young women with unattractive men both having lack luster personalities and equally boring comedic situations.  The British have always done comedy well and Waiting for God with the feisty Diana Trent and the amicable Tom Ballard hits the spot.  Why can't America follow the Brits lead and have more programs that feature people in all stages of life and not just the young pretty ones.  We need character and that comes with age and you'll find that in this series.  I can't wait for Season 5 to be released.,1247702400,4,949,4.508771929824562
2637048,5,B000HEZ7NY,We all should have the occasions available to reek havoc on the establishment when it comes to being made to live in a Retirement Home. Levity and good clean fun are something we don't partake in enough any time in life so why not engage ourselves even more so as a senior. Please pick this up ASAP... I can't wait for Season 5. Ray F.,1246924800,,335,4.1692307692307695
2637049,5,B000HEZ7NY,"""Waiting for God"" is a delightful, funny, and poignant series. Tom and Diana face the prospect of aging with feistiness and a sense of humor. My family and I watch episodes many times over and have found it worth investing in the DVD sets for ourselves. The humor and the characters are timeless.",1246665600,3,296,4.60377358490566
2637050,5,B000HEZ7NY,"Back to Bayview!  The retirement complex for the almost dead, whose administrator (Harvey Bains, played by Daniel Hill) is constantly plagued by the antics of the two aging with attitude oldsters, Tom & Diana (Graham Crowden & Stephanie Cole).  This is 'Round Four.'  Score so far:  Tom & Diana, 4; Harvey, 0.  And so it continues.  With interesting situations, snapppy dialogue, and remarkable characterizations, the battle continues.  This is my all-time favourite BritCom, bar none.

This season marks the appearance - for the first time on this side of the Atlantic of which I am aware - of the second Christmas episode.  According to my sources, Diana is chosen to direct a Christmas Pagent. (That is the working equivalent of putting Pontius Pilate in charge of a Hannukah Festival.)

If you have never ""been to Bayview"" DO NOT MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST SET OF DISCS.  Start at the beginning, with Season (Series) One, episode one (""Arrival."")  Jumping in here would not only confuse, but spoil the fun of getting to know Tom & Diana as those of us who have followed their adventures have.  The show has a definite beginning, middle, and end.  Oddly enough, I was first introduced to the unlikely pair through the episode ""The Seance,"" and my host had to explain way too much to me, although I did about die laughing.  You will too, regardless of what episode you watch; however, as a WFG veteran, I do strongly recommend viewing in order.

Bayview - there really should be one at the end of every acacia avenue!  My highest recommendation goes to the entire series.  I can't wait for the final episode of the final season.  Too bad BBC saw fit to release the discs with agonizing (for us) slowness.

Here's to Tom & Diana - long may they plot!",1242864000,17,1745,4.696369636963697
2637051,5,B000HEZ7NY,I love this show and have begun to follow in Diana's foot steps. It's more fun. Why go quietly when you can stir things up. Just because you are aging does not mean you can't have a full and fun life. I have been disabled for 16 years and still find new things to do or learn. My horizons just keep getting better despite chronic pain and to many other things to list. This year I will become 67 and don't see myself stopping.,1237939200,6,426,4.083333333333333

2637107,5,B000HEZ7NY,"This is English humor toward the eccentric and wacky end of the spectrum. I enjoyed the entire season. I thought an American version would be good, set in the Motion Picture Retirement home in LA. This is about intelligent curmudgeonly delightfully cranky and contrary people of older status. It is sort of middle grade BBC production value.",1424304000,,341,5.0

2637111,5,B000HEZ7NY,These programs are always funny especially if you understand British humor.,1415923200,,75,5.909090909090909
2637112,5,B000HEZ7NY,"Well now, I would love to recommend this British Comedy Series especially to the older Generations, because
so many of them lost humor and need good laughs. Let this be your Morning Wake Up Call. Believe me, you will
feel refreshed for the rest of the day.
Absolute full of Humor, funny action and behavior of the older people who had lived their life and have nothing
else to do anymore but; To Wait For God.
Actually, it would not hurt that younger folks see this, perhaps they would gain some Humor.
How do you fill 24 hours every day, without going Nuts ??
Enjoy, it is hilarious,

2637129,5,B000HEZ7NY,British Comedy at it's best. Diane is the kind of old lady I'd like to be and Tom is so adorable that you love him instantly. I think things are even better now that they've realized that they love each other.,1407456000,,209,4.121951219512195
2637130,5,B000HEZ7NY,I really love this series. It is so funny to see these old people up against a young man who is out to ruin the place and try to keep them all down and out.,1402358400,,156,3.4857142857142858
2637131,5,B000HEZ7NY,I love this series!  Aging is a difficult subject and we all will get there eventually...God Willing!  This show gives a funny if not bittersweet view of being in a retirement facility.  Diane is quite a pistol!  I hope I'm like her when I grow up!,1399248000,,248,4.326086956521739

2637164,5,B000HEZ7NY,I've enjoyed the entire series of Waiting For God. My father-in-law introduced us to this series years ago and each episode produced many belly laughs!,1379980800,,151,5.08
2637165,4,B000HEZ7NY,I have the first three seasons of this British comedy series and I must admit I always liked it for the fact that it is different. It is about aging in a senior citizen housing community...no beauty queens or young studs here.  It isn't the funniest of the series but good for a few laughs.  I will be getting the last of the series season five because I've got he previous four and have got to have the full set.,1374019200,,413,4.15

2637172,5,B000HEZ7NY,"My reviews are very short.  This is an excellent series --- one of the reasons being the use of English vernacular which I enjoy identifying... probably because I was born in Scotland.

Truthfully, I don't think I have seen a bad episode from all the seasons ---- it's truthful, funny, tongue in cheek and a great treat to watch...",1259366400,,331,4.593220338983051
2637173,5,B000HEZ7NY,As per usual Diana and Tom deliver. My only downside to the Brit com's is they don't release them here in the US as fast as they should.,1252627200,5,136,3.892857142857143

8139510,4,B000HEZ7NY,"This series is one I watch for relaxation- usually from my pillow. One does not have to be discerning or alert, just entertained and amused. You may know senior citizens and their relatives like these characters or you may believe they are all made up. The same for their exploits. It's a Britcom, but easy to understand without subtitles.",1495584000,,339,4.762711864406779
