324058,5,6301300548,"when i saw ""the other"" in its initial release, i left the theater more paranoid than i had been before!
based on tom tryon's sadly out-of-print best seller, it is a tale that once and for all will destroy the notion about saintly children.  niles and holland are among the greatest villains ever placed on screen, and how anyone can call them a contrast of good and evil (as leonard maltin does in his illogical review) confounds me.  there are wonderful scenic touches, perfectly catching the struggles of a 1930s farm family, and i am still blown away by the brilliance of the performance of uta hagen:as complex a character as you're likely to see on-screen.  as an aside, the young actors who play the leads, chris and martin udvarnoky, are wondrous to behold.  fans of a certain type will not be disappointed by these two, who sadly never acted again.  let us rejoice that this movie managed to capture them at the peak of their talents and their charms.

I fell in-love with the movie and I've been anticipating it's release every since the advent of VCR's. I remember the movie to be excellent in all ways. From the music score to the acting. Those boys were terrific. I wished we got those types of psychological/suspenseful movies today (without ALL the gore). Again, I must say that this has got to be the best thriller of ALL TIMES.

Along with ""The Haunting of Julia,""  it is one of the two most scary films I have seen.  I am equally happy to  say that The Other does not rely on gore and other cheap thrills to get its  point across... Instead, it uses superb storytelling and acting that keeps  you hooked through the surprise ending. To close, I guess I should say that  most films I see and like, I forget about after a year, or so.  The Other  is the kind of classic shocker that I don't think I will ever forget.  The  fact that it is still so clear in my mind after all these years should tell  you something.  Quite frankly, in its genre, there is no better!",954028800,8,811,4.161290322580645

Unlike the slash and gore movies of today, this is a wonderfully subtle, chilling psychological look into  the minds of a very disturbed pair of twins and the grandmother who tries  to protect them, but must ultimately do the right thing. This movie is  similar in feel to ""The Good Son"" (starring McCauley Culkin), but  is much more subtle, with a surprise ending.",918950400,3,480,4.546511627906977

The '70s really were the best time for low-key psychological thrillers (The Legend of Lizzie Borden, The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane) and The Other definitely falls into that category, as well as playing like a very, very dark Waltons episode, etc. There is no gore here but the film is unsettling with a twist that doesn't cheat (the clues are all there and will be easy to spot on a second viewing) and the fact that it was a 1930s period piece to begin with means it hasn't dated as much as other films from 1972.",1497139200,,614,4.301724137931035

324167,5,6301300548,"Psychopaths committing murders are formidable; even more disturbing are child murderers who are precocious psychopathic, homicidal maniacs.
Although fiction, the director Robert Mulligan captured the true nature of child murderers in this film, The Other, with a master's ability to portray the proverbial Evil Twin in the dubious sanctuary of the Tender Year's Doctrine under the law.  The genius of the Producer is match by the precocious twin boy actors Chris and Martin Udvarnoky who are the Perry twins in the movie.  In 1956, Patty McCormick meticulously played the major role of 8 year-old Rhoda Penmark as the enfant terrible in the 1956 fiction thriller The Bad Seed.  Then in 1993, Macaulay Culkin was the angelic-looking boy Henry who was the developing psychopathic child killer in The Good Son.  This 1972 movie ""The Other"" compliments the thriller collection with an Evil Twin - deceased brother Holland speaks to his living Twin, tragedies occur that are accidents - but are not accidents - staged as murders by
a child psychopath.  This is a five star performance by the young actors Chris and Martin with Uta Hagen that keeps the viewer guessing at each event right up to the ending.  Very pleased to see this 1972 movie available in DVD format.  Well done!",1470700800,8,1274,5.009478672985782

Too much short tight shorts. Too much TIME to get to the good stuff. The payoff was ok, not great. The build was... meh. I don't know. Just my personal opinion. It was really boring to me.

324201,5,6301300548,"Made back in 1972 this remastering by Eureka films does total justice to this film that never got the accolades it fully deserved. Set in the Connecticut summer of 1935 we meet twins Niles and Holland Perry. They live in an extended family but their mother seems to be dealing with some sort of mental breakdown. Their paternal grandmother has taught them a `game' that she brought from her native Russia which seems to involve outer body experiences.

Then a series of things start to happen around the farmstead and as the evidence starts to unfold it becomes clear to Niles that his twin is responsible - even though he really knows that Holland does not mean to be bad. What unfolds is a chilling game of life and death.

This is one of those films that will get the hair on the back of your neck to rise - for all the right reasons. Played absolutely straight by a stellar cast this is just quietly horrific; but it is all done in good taste. It has aged really well and has extremely high production values with a story that will hold you right until the end. It is also so well done that you would have no problems watching it again - which is quite rare in such a genre of film making. If you have never come across this one before then you have a treat waiting for you - absolutely recommended.",1428710400,,1303,4.336065573770492

The DVD is terrific in its sound and image presentation, but a shocking lack of extras take its down a star. No audio commentary from Mulligan? No interviews with the stars? No documentary from 20th century fox--even a shortie? Are you kidding? This movie is better remembered than that, especially since it features a small role for John Ritter.

The Other must be put in timely perspective to be truly appreciated. It was released in 1972, roughly a year after the novel. At the time, it shared the bestseller lists with The Exorcist, and the movie actually came out BEFORE Blatty's blockbuster. Children in peril were a hot concept. There were few films that dealt with evil children (The Bad Seed) and twist endings were much more rare than they are today. Horror and thrills were often implied and seldom shown. As a result, someone raised on slasher films, torture porn, gratuitous violence, and bloodbaths may not be able to appreciate the white-hot timing, freshness, and deftness of what was a chilling concept subtly unfolding on screen. This is a psychological thriller. Even so, much of what is commonplace on the big screen was unexpected when this 'small movie' made its run.

This tale is rooted in Jung's notion of The Shadow (hence the great DVD cover) utilized to great effect in this simmering affair. Twin brothers, Niles and Holland Perry, share everything, yet they are as different as night and day: one sunny and cheerful, the other brooding and evil. The family farm is a serene, peaceful place. Niles and Holland spend their days fishing, playing in the barn, going to the carnival, and playing 'the game'. The game is astral projection, taught to them by their Russian born grandmother, Ada, who seems all too eager to let the game playing continue...until it is too late.

This slow-builder continues until, before we know it, the warm water reaches a boil. There is such a rich undercurrent here that impatient viewers may miss: hints of incest between Niles and his downtrodden mother, suggestions of a possible clairvoyance by Niles, who has the foresight to saw the cellar lock for his upcoming magic trick. It could be just for the magic trick...or...? And the notion of what could happen when one twin loses another. What if the shadow in one has nowhere to go?

This is a taut, understated story that seems like a paradox. The disturbing reality is made all the more unsettling set against a summer family farm, which makes the horror slowly surround the viewer. Everything seems fine on the surface, but beneath the cellar doors...nothing is quite what it appears. Many newer movies have taken cues from The Other: The Good Son, The Sixth Sense, Orphan, Insidious, etc. For my money, they lack the staunch contrast and believability of this one.",1319155200,9,2468,4.883054892601432

324335,5,6301300548,"This film, which I first saw on the large screen in the 'seventies, is one of a rash of tales of the bizarre that emerged, it seems to me, with ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) and was followed by ""The Omen,"" ""Harvest Home,"" and the ""The Exorcist,"" among others (They were perhaps intended to take the public's minds off of the madness of the 'sixties, including several nasty wars, student protests, and the energy crunch). To me, ""The Other"" surpasses its contemporary fright-flicks, for two principal reasons: acting and cinematography.

The acting honours go primarily to Uta Hagen, the phenomenal actress of the Broadway theatre, who plays the grandmother of the twins with sincerity and grace. Her performance, which is truly moving, lifts what might have been a good but run-of-the-mill horror film into the realm of the extraordinary. Similarly, the casting of the twins (Chris and Martin Udvarnoky) was inspired. These were no smart-alec Hollywood brats; instead, they were natural, believable boys, who are consequently convincing in their roles. Their personas of normality, in fact, contribute immensely to the eerie atmosphere of the film.

The cinematography is especially to be commended. The apparent normalcy of the setting initially reassures the viewer, who becomes gradually unsettled and--almost unawares--chilled, as the tale of horror unfolds. The pastoral setting of New England of the 1930s exudes tranquility--fields of alfalfa, whitewashed fences, sunflowers tilting against an old red barn--a feeling of comfort that is increasingly disturbed by nightmarish visions: birds of ill-omen, dark root-cellars, and upturned pitchforks. The old-fashioned iron rooster weathervane, which at first conveyed a sense of rural wellbeing, whirls violently in the hurricane that ravages the landscape.

""The Other,"" the script of which was written by the author of the novel, Thomas Tryon, accomplishes most of the horror offstage, as it were; the film was produced in an era when it was thought unnecessary to drench the audience in blood and guts. Therefore, it will probably not be appreciated by viewers who enjoy the in-your-face genre of horror films. But for those who appreciate the subtleties of suggestion, ""The Other"" represents a rich--if macabre--feast for the imagination.

P.S. Do not read the blurb on the back of the DVD--as another viewer has suggested--or watch the trailers before you watch the film. They give the entire show away. Do, however, read Mr Tryon's novel afterwards, if the book is available. It was, as I recall, riveting.",1313884800,8,2562,5.349875930521092

The Other (1972) to me is a very strange psychological horror movie.  This is one of those movies that keeps you guessing and has a lot of twists and turns.  It takes place in rural Connecticut in 1935.  The movie is very slow moving, especially for the first 50 minutes or so.  When watching this movie I felt as though I was watching The Waltons with a little bit of Little House On The Prairie sprinkled in, but with a twist of horror.  Probably 95% of the movie takes place during daylight hours.  Most of the time it doesn't even feel like a horror movie, but the second half of the movie injects a horror element.

The musical score is by Jerry Goldsmith.  The music is mostly upbeat throughout the movie and would fit right into an episode of The Waltons or Little House On The Prairie.  A very young John Ritter has a very small role in this movie.  The ending of the movie is pretty twisted.

The DVD transfer looks great.  Clear picture and sound.

This 1972 Robert Mulligan film falls into the latter category, and makes superb work of a heady rural Connecticut summer atmosphere as a backdrop for the story. As the film begins we have trouble figuring out the relations of the extended Perry family living together on a large farm: there is the married daughter Torrie, Aunt Vee and her horrible tattletale child Russell, and fragile shut-in Alexandra (Diana Muldaur). And there is also Alexandra's mother, the Russian immigrant Ada (Uta Hagen, in a rare film appearance), and Alexandra's twin sons Niles and Holland (Martin and Chris Udvarnoky). Gradually we begin to realize something is not quite right with the mischief-making twins, and that the elder, Holland, is genuinely malicious, and given to playing mysterious deadly pranks. Part of the film's most genuinely disturbing qualities are that we never feel we quite get the full story on the ambiguous relationship between Holland and Niles--or what it fully has to do with the strange ""great game"" Ada has taught Niles to play. While some of the film's effects are a bit cheesy, many are genuinely horrific, and work very well on the imagination by not showing everything (the eventually revealed whereabouts of Torrie's missing baby being the most famous). Mulligan has a genuine gift for recreating a fly-buzzed, dreamy atmosphere of a Depression-era New England summer that seems to work with the film's horrors in remarkable ways. Much depends on the film's casting, and though Hagen is not as believable as you'd like, the Udvarnoky twins are wonderfully effective, seeming alternately sweet and repulsive as the plot demands; as with his TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD a decade earlier, Mulligan again shows his real feel for working with child actors. The beautiful Muldaur, more often seen as a television actress, also has one of her rare compelling roles for film as the twins' fragile and haunted mother.",1245542400,3,2160,5.053221288515406

Set in rural, provencial New England in the early 20th century, The Other is one of those ""evil child"" films in which a veritable ""evil twin"" scenario unfolds when one of the two Perry brothers perishes at the bottom of a well. The very apparent subconscious ghost of 'Holland' takes root in Niles' schizophrenic mind, wherein he deals with his grief by externalizing his dead brother as a mischievous split personality influence, thus committing various gruesome murders. To Niles, his brother is very real in his subjective reality, with all the blame transferred onto him, the ""other"". A definite mental dissociation.

One by one, the country folk in this small township begin experiencing a series of mysterious deaths, with no one the wiser that it could possibly be this very clever innocent-looking child, and thus, the events continue to unfold.

Victims include his very own parents, an obnoxious whining playmate, a musical old lady, and perhaps most disturbingly, even a new-born baby: Dad ""trips"" and falls into the barn cellar; after discovering and confiscating a secret item, Mom tumbles down a flight of stairs but survives with paralysis; a tattle-telling boy is impaled on a conveniently-placed pitchfork while jumping into a hay bale playing ""King of The Mountain"", even though he was forbidden to romp therein; Mrs. Rowe is quite literally frightened to death {her phobia is exploited}; probably feeling all the attention he craved was being diverted, the new-born baby goes missing one stormy night only to meet a tragic fate, while shifting the blame onto a local farmhand. In each case, it became an exaggerated matter of revenge wherein his 'evil twin' felt justified to finalize.

Throughout the film, Niles is counselled by the wise and kind Ada about his special gifts, a gypsy-grandmother type who teaches him to practice mental projection via visualization, wherein he travels into the perspective of a raven, flying forth across the land wherein he actually prognosticates the demise of the pestiferous boy. Learning of his nefarious 'Holland' alter-ego, she tries to provide grounding through asserting his death by admonishing him to 'view' his brother at the grave in the coffin, but it proves too much for his mind's eye, and so she assents. She eventually learns the extent of his deeds, blames herself, and thereby takes it upon herself to rid the town of them both.

Besides the deaths, other notable scenes include a trip to the carnival, wherein he witnesses various 'freaks', and the shenanigans of an illusionist 'disappearing' for the crowd.

For a horror movie, the film uses atypical wholesome-like common-day settings as a stage, instead of standard nightmarish props, effects, characters, or environments, seemingly stating that the likelihood of such occurrences could unexpectedly happen any where at any time, even in the most day-lit or misperceived 'safe' circumstances.

Amidst this idyllic setting, a series of family tragedies takes place...the Perry's father has died of an accident, the mother is rendered an invalid due to some sort of mental breakdown, and there are more tragedies to follow. The only adult that seems to have an inkling of what's going on is Uta Hagen's grandmother character, who teaches Niles 'the game' which reveals darker undertones as the story moves along...we see a golden-haired boy who seems harmless enough on the surface but as time progresses, something darker is revealed, leaving us reeling when the truth is revealed [though it doesn't take too long for the viewer to deduce what is actually unfolding here]. Is it a case of evil vs good twin, split personality or unnatural forces at work? Not to give too much away, let's just say that this movie is a first-rate psychological horror movie that has moments that will give you the creeps. The actor who plays Niles Perry does an excellent job of portraying a tormented soul, and Uta Hagen is wonderful as the all-seeing grandmother that is torn between her love for her grandson and the need to put a stop to the horrors unfolding around her.

Niles and Holland Perry, twins, are the two younger sons of the family, both somewhere around 10 or 11 years of age.

Niles is the good one; Holland is his opposite. Also part of the family is Ada, the Russian grandmother of the two boys, who looks after them with great care and with a special gift as well--the ""game"", in which she teaches them to project themselves into the mind's eye of another being. We first see Niles playing the game with a crow; he sees what the crow sees when the bird is flying high over the surrounding town.

As it happens, playing the ""game"" is strongly tied to the tragic events that ensue during the course of the film in which several people die. But how this happens is ultimately a huge surprise (which won't be revealed here). On hand here is Diana Muldaur as the suffering mother, Uta Hagen in what should have been an Academy Award-winning role as Ada, and John Ritter in an early role as the Perry older son who has married and is awaiting the birth of his first child.

The look and feel of the times are recreated quite well; director Robert Mulligan has done an excellent job in his delivery of a script by Tom Tryon, the author of the novel on which the film was based. There's a kind of no-frills style on display here which serves the film well; we see the characters, often up close, involved in each other's lives in a way that rings true for that era.  Personal relationships are the key to the tragedy and the terror that is this film.

They play together all the time, get into mischief together and share secrets. It appears the two have some pretty dark secrets. Based on a novel by Tom Tryon, this film takes its time setting the mood and introducing its horrific themes. In ways it plays like a nostalgic trip down childhood memory lane, with buying fresh vegetables from a traveling farm market, stealing cookies from the oven and spending lazy afternoons fishing in the local pond. Director Robert Mulligan brings much of the natural, rural feel to ""The Other"" that he brought to some of his other movies, such as ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""The Man In the Moon."" With it, he lulls into a sense of comfort and complacency that belies the evil that lurks nearby. This really is a masterfully crafted movie and, although I have not read the novel, I can say the story unfolds much the way a book does. My only gripe would be the performance of the boy who plays Niles, Chris Udvarnoky. I realize he is supposed to be a nice, polite kid, but he is so over the top I could barely stand to watch. Not only is he saccharine sweet, but he occasionally gets his intonation all wrong, as though reading from a book. He was only about ten when he made the movie, so I must cut him some slack. I just thought Mr. Mulligan might coax a really good performance from his child actors the way he did in the two aforementioned films.

I remember reading Tom Tryon's book when it first came out. It was frightful beyond anything else I had read at the time. When the movie came out I couldn't wait to see it. When I did finally see it I was both thrilled and disappointed.

Translating a book with numerous rich characters and subplots to the screen is often a difficult task, as was in this case. But overall I think they did a great job.

Watching this movie again, years later, I still feel the same because I can still remember how involved the book was. I am not hoping for a remake of the movie, that would probably prove a horrendous affair.

But... judging the movie all on it's own I would have to say it is a very good movie.

It is a period piece as well as being a thriller with drama set in. All the actors do a fantastic job. The sets and cinematography are great. This is a classic piece without a doubt. It has a slow build up as any good thriller should have.

What is striking about this story is the slow development into unrecoverable terror that the story takes us on. When the momentum finally starts it's downhill roll all knuckles are white in anticipation of the final crash.

But ultimatley it is a story of good and evil. In this case, both stuggling for the same body, ironically displayed in identical twins in this story. Very good twist on a classic theme!

So, if you're tired of the sex-and-slice or gamebox movies, and want something with a stronger story and character development this would be the one for you. Hitchcock and DePalma fans will certainly enjoy this one.",1162252800,9,1597,4.389830508474576

Niles and Holland are twins living in New England and they enjoy the typical tomfoolery that boys of their age. The problem is that Holland has a very mean streak to him. I won't tell you more, but suffice it to say that this one is a nail biter.

This variation on ""The Bad Seed"" involving twins is a top notch character study, psychological suspense thriller and atmospheric chiller directred by Robert Mulligan. Based on the late actor/writer Thomas Tryon's novel of the same name ""The Other"" is subtle where most films of this type would hammer home the plot points. Well written, directed and acted the film continues to generate chills. Sadly actors Chris and Martin Udvarnoky never made another film after this one which is too bad as both child actors give great performances. Kudos also to Diana Muldaur and Uta Hagen who play their mother and grandmother respectively.

The Fox release ia puzzling--if you read the copy on the back of the box it gives away major plot points prior to watching the film. The film is more enjoyable if the audience actually discovers what's happening on their own. The cover artwork is quite evocative but also gives too much information. My suggestion is if you haven't seen this atmospheric thriller don't read the synopsis of the film.

Fox has done a nice job in transferring the film it looks pretty good although the images are occasionally a bit soft (sometimes intentionally other times not). We get the original theatrical trailer and trailers for other Fox titles as extras.

Thomas Tryon's sensational novel was adapted (by him) and transferred to film with loving care by the great Robert Mulligan (TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, SUMMER OF '42). The leads are played by the legendary Uta Hagen in a rare film appearance and the talented young Udvarnoky twins as Niles and Holland, with a supporting cast to match them. Add some stunning cinematography, ace editing, and an eerie score by the late Jerry Goldsmith (who also scored THE OMEN), and the result is one of the finest films of its kind.

Nearly every reviewer here has given this 5 stars, and we've all mentioned that the deliberate pace and lack of outright gore only add to the film's effectiveness. True. But I think the most effective thing about this remarkable story is the fact that it is entirely possible--it is not far-fetched or supernatural. Tryon based his novel on actual case studies. If that doesn't scare you, what does?

In a genre where vampires and zombies are all-too-prevalent, it is a chilling pleasure to experience a film that explores real, earthly evil. THE OTHER is that rarest of Hollywood products--a horror movie for grown-ups. It belongs in the DVD library of any serious lover of the best in suspense.",1157328000,9,1262,4.757990867579909

324440,5,6301300548,"There's just something about a good old fashioned thriller.  Something ominous yet thoughtful.  Sinister yet complicated.  Dark, foreboding, gloomy, and terrifying.  All these are great adjectives to help describe the film adapation of Thomas Tyron's best-selling novel The Other.  Horror films of the 1970's have an appeal and a quality that the films of the '80's (with all their blood and gore and slashing) lost.  The '70's produced such gems as Don't Look Now, Audrey Rose, Demon Seed, The Omen, and of course the mother of them all, The Exorcist (my comment about '80's gore notwithstanding).  The Other is a perfectly paced and well crafted film that stands up to these fine examples of 70's psychological horror.  There's the Depression, a remote farm, a family shadowed in despair, hints of the supernatural, and a mystery that stays just two steps ahead of you until it's too late.  Many may say that the film is boring.  I say the pacing of the film allows you to savor every last frame and nuance.  Many may say that they had it all figured out from the get-go.  I say, stop ruining it for the rest of us.  The Other is a slowly unspooling yarn of a nightmare of a story.  The film is well shot and directed with style by Robert Mulligan.  Not to mention the cast headed by the incomparable Uta Hagen (may she rest in peace), the Udvarnoky boys (now middle-aged, living and working quiet lives in New Jersey), and the gone-too-soon John Ritter.  Diana Muldaur's performance is breathtaking.  If you enjoy the telling of eerie tales that leave you with that cold, queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach, pick up the upcoming dvd of The Other.  Great addition to your dvd library and a great example of 1970's psychological horror.",1155686400,9,1744,4.718543046357616

All seems idyllic until Ada discovers that Niles is apparently seeing and communicating with his twin brother Holland who died a tragic death.  She attempts to stop Niles from playing the ""game"" but Holland seems to be gaining control. And Holland has a penchant for cruelty and murder.

His grandmother, Ada, who has taught them ""the Game"", a mind-projection technique, gradually learns the horrible truth about the tragedies,and decides to take matters into her own hands. Uta Hagen, who played the grandmother, does a bravura performance that really should have won an Oscar.

The first half of the movie moves rather slowly; a lot of characterization and scene development occurs, seemingly unnecessarily, but actually vital to the plot. While the ""trick"" won't be given away here, keen observers of the interaction between all of the characters will be able to figure it out.

This movie is in the same vein as 70s introspective, slow-moving movies that were the hallmark of the era. One review compared it with Picnic At Hanging Rock; I think that's a perfect analogy. The MTV generation has been ruined by Rambo films, where everything happens at a mile-a-minute; this film is not one of those. As in so many other 70s-era films, you really do need to be patient, watch carefully, and ponder. This is an intelligent film.

  the plot is about twin brothers niles and holland perry(chris and martin udvarnoky both stunning as the boys ) living on a farm in the depression era north east farm with a large extended family. their father died some years ago and their mother (diana muldaur in a heartbreaking role) has become a hermit and slowly is loseing her mind. the boys grandmother (the great uta hagen in a role that should have gotten her an oscar) helps take care of the boys and teaches the boys a ""game"" where they project their minds into things and people to pretend to be that thing. it is summer and the boys play and do things all little boys do,almost. something is wrong on the farm,things bad things keep happening and it looks like holland may be causeing them to happen. people start dieing in ""accidents"" only the grandmother can see the truth but is it to late to stop it.

324446,5,6301300548,"Psychological horror at its best. No one who's seen The Other goes away unimpressed. As other reviews indicate, the movie has developed a strong cult following and deservedly so.  Like so many low-key gems, this one too would likely fade into oblivion were it not for VHS and the internet, which can now build an audience from the grass-roots up. And this obscure little movie certainly merits  revival.

Director Mulligan worked against convention, filming his classic in bright open sunlight, instead of the creepy shadow and low-key stage lighting dictated by Gothic tradition. But the style works, thanks to a fluid and highly intelligent camera. Watch the opening scene, as the slow pan meanders its way toward the solitary boy revealed finally in dreamy soft focus. This reverie sets the perfect psychological tone for the story and is key to the over-arching plot device. There are other moments of slow, silent pans that lend both atmosphere and creepy suspense, and I particularly like the way Mulligan stays with Niles' little world in spellbinding fashion. That way, the surrounding mayhem is only glimpsed and  not belabored, allowing our imagination room to take over. For fans of the genre, his technique is reminiscent of Peter Weir's 1970's co-classic, Picnic at Hanging Rock.

Horror films rarely rely on acting for their impact. This one, however -- as other reviewers point out -- is a rarity. The performances are first-rate, particularly the astonishingly fine turn by the Udvarnoky twins. Chris who plays Niles achieves a naturalness and spontaneity that is itself almost scary. I don't think I've ever seen a farm boy portrayed more convincingly, nor has boyish exuberance been more expertly conveyed than in his spirited gallop to wherever he's going -- which makes the main plot device all the more sinister. Then too, there's Diana Muldaur's agonizing portrayal of the  mother. It is only through her stricken eyes that the audience comes to realize the enormity of what's happening, while the shot of her wraith-like face framed by a dirty window pane is enough to haunt many a sleepless night. Moreover, the bustling farm family, always busy wth this and that, appears straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting.

Yes, the story unfolds in a complex manner, placing a bit of a burden on the audience. And there are a few holes, as when the elderly neighbor calls the magician Holland instead of Niles -- presumably she's close enough to the household to know better. Nonetheless, there's not an ounce of fat on Tom Tryon's screenplay, while the scattered parts come convincingly together by movie's close. For those fans max'ed out on slasher-gore and blood-fest, this exercise in implied horror is the perfect antidote -- and a worthy addition to the legendary tradition of Nosferatu, Vampyr, and Val Lewton's imaginative 1940's cycle of Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie, and The Seventh Victim.

324448,5,6301300548,"Well, regardless that most people do not see this movie as I do with regard to the plot, especially the climax, I still hold my own ideas that I've had since my first viewing of it, since I also read the novel a few times, whereas I must have seen this movie close to 100 times as a teen.  Different people seem to hold what I consider very unusual ideas about the plot - they go on to say how ""obvious"" the plot is and yet go on to create a completely different plot than what I personally understand it to be!  Perhaps you shall decide for yourself in watching this great film.

Without giving too much away, I hope, ask yourself about which boy is REALLY which and how do you really know - and why did the mother actually go mad?  Was it because she was also concerned about what the surviving twin was claiming, which was actually wrong relative to who he really was?  And if it was really the ""evil twin"" who dies, why does the horror continue?  Seemingly, my own view of the plot is the exact opposite about what other reviews have claimed, which is why I'm putting in my own two cents, so to speak.

At any rate, this is an amazing movie no matter what you think the plot actually is, or what questions remain unanswered.  The overall mood and the music is uncanny, and almost every line is delivered in a very memorable way that stays with you for years longer than the general flow of conversation in other movies.  (Well, I suppose especially if you'd seen it as often as I have.)

Think about what you are seeing and hearing, since this movie does tend to demand more at least in comparison to modern movies which often demand little.

For example, one may ask if that ""flashback"" that ""Niles"" has(ANOTHER ""accident"" you should ask?) is what really happened or is just a pretending because of guilt at one level.

""I'm me - Niles Perry""

""Are you SURE?""

I'm really surprised people seem to have missed out on what that could actually mean.  Ah well.  Most assuredly recommended.

324470,4,6301300548,"""The Other"" portrays young twin brothers (Niles & Holland) in depression-era, rural Connecticut.  The boys live with and are being raised by their large extended family (including a very young John Ritter) after the death of their father.  Their mother (Diana Muldaur of ""LA Law"") is unstable and has become a near recluse in her attic bedroom.  The boys are thus free to run wild and wreak havoc on their family and neighbors.

Released in 1972, ""The Other"" is rather eerie with supernatural overtones, including a magic ring and a strange ""game"" the boys like to play with the help of their grandmother (the talented stage actress Uta Hagen).  The tone is helped immensely by the controlled direction of Robert Mulligan (""To Kill a Mockingbird"") as well as uniformly good acting; the twins are played skillfully by Chris and Martin Udvarnoky - this movie was their only one.

On the negative side, the story builds very slowly, and some viewers may be put off by the languid first half.  However, the movie definitely pays off: the last 20 minutes are tense and chilling.  There are a number of twists -- mostly obvious but very effective nevertheless.  Overall, ""The Other"" is a solid suspense film that will entertain viewers who enjoy atmospheric chillers.

324472,4,6301300548,"This film holds up well in the decades since its release. It was filmed boldly in color, and yet director Robert Mulligan still maintained the ""feel"" of the Depression in 1935 Connecticut. This was a world he perfected in 1962 with his classic film, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. The script by Tom Tryon, from his own novel, was fraught with challenges for the minds and hearts of the viewers.
Twins Chris and Martin Udvarnoky were perfectly cast as twins Niles and Holland Perry. They had been discovered doing plays for Herbert Berghof, who just happened to be married to Uta Hagen. This movie was the only film work the twins ever did. They just seemed to drop out of sight afterward, heightening the reality of their performances. When I first saw this film in a theatre in 1972, I bought the extant twins premise. It was skillfully handled visually by Mulligan. I was strung along until midway when Uta Hagen, as the grandmother Ada Perry, revealed to the young Niles that his ""bad"" brother, Holland, had been dead for a year.
The movie worked on two levels successfully. There was a sun-kissed rural 1930's heartland, a kid's woodland paradise, on the one hand; great spans of forest and field, old barns, and dark mysterious cellars. Juxtaposed to that, overlapping and intermeshing with that, we discovered a Gothic plot; complete with a doomed family haunted by dark psychic powers, whose family crest was a peregrine falcon, for their name Perry, emblazoned on an heirloom ring, and on the creaking weathervane high atop the Victorian style house. Murder stalked the Perry farm, and spread out to the neighbors; murder disguised as accident.
Mulligan orchestrated wonderful touching moments between Uta Hagen and young Chris as Niles...loving moments whereby a blue-eyed angelic tow-headed child adored his wise and spirtually advanced grandmother. Much was made of the special psychic games they played, with Niles projecting his mind, and perhaps even his essence, into things and others; guessing the sex of his sister's unborn child, and even projecting into a crow, able to cognizantly fly freely over the farmlands cawing greetings to all it recognized. This was a game that Niles was so adept at, had perfected so well, that he had no difficulty dealing with his own split personality, and embracing a form of complete denial at to his brother's actual death, and further denial as to his own responsiblity for conducting divers heinous acts in the guise of, or as Holland. So Niles never had to be alone, would not accept being alone.
Diana Muldaur, as the mother Alexandra, was simply wonderful as the archetypical Gothic doomed heroine; beautiful, vulnerable, descending into madness and darkness and near catatonia. Her meager attempts to regain some emotional balance, to recapture the light, were soon dashed by the evil actions and reactions of Niles, who seemed to love her and loathe her, and definitely wished her harm.
Uta Hagen, a great actress of the Theatre, completed only three films, and a slew of television roles. In this one, she was very effective as a kind of Maria Ouspenskaya mid-European matriarch, with some kind of a dark past, and considerable psychic abilities. She radiated love for her entire doomed family, and riddled with guilt for her part in the machinations of plot, she was willing to sacrifice, to martyr herself in order to stop the killings. It was a kinky and delicious twist that her sacrifice was to no avail.
Victor French gave a fine performance in the small role of the farm handyman, Mr. Angelini [nice symbolism]. He did well with is brief scenes, illustrating the frustration and lonliness of an emigrant in America during the Depression; a man descended into drunkeness as a panacea or refuge; only to find himself dragged from his enebriated sweaty slumber and accused of murdering an infant; ala the Lindburgh case of that era. We witnessed racial prejudice and insane mob rule as the family and the authorities leaped headlong to incorrect conclusions. John Ritter was adequate in the likewise small role of Rider, the son-in-law living in the Perry household. It was a tiny part, but it hinted at Ritter's future talents.
The ironic ending reasonated with all the significant chords of a horror contata. At the fade, one wondered who would be next on the adolescent death list?  Mulligan struck gold mining Tryon's dark tale.",1089244800,8,4390,4.9646739130434785

324477,5,6301300548,I really like the image composition and the photography of the 70's.  The Other brilliantly mingles poetry and mystery into a cinematographic jewel which is a pleasure for the eyes and brain of the viewer.

324489,4,6301300548,"I watched this film late at night after having seen ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" and I don't need to tell you that ""The Other"" freaked me out more.  I would say this is more on the line of M. Night Shamylam's films like ""The Sixth Sense"" than a slasher/supernatural devil child movie.  The film has a beautiful bucolic, rustic setting and takes place in the 1930s and involves the story of twin brothers, Niles and Holland, one who is good and the other, evil.  Elements of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" with the dark side of humanity as portrayed in Shirley Jackson's stories. There are some surprises and plot twists in this film that I will not spoil but it does set up things nicely and you will find yourself thinking back and having it all make sense.  As beautiful as the setting was, there is a sense of dread underlying the film and I found myself caring enough about the characters and what was going to happen to them to worry about what their fate would be.  The child actors portraying the twins are very natural and believable and the realationship between good twin, Niles and the Nanny played by Uta Hagen is very believable and well acted.  Good chemistry.  I have heard of this movie but usually listed for late night TV but always saw that it had 4 stars which differs from most late night movies.  Well made and acted movie which was scary, chilling and tragic. Sadly, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this type of movie wouldn't be shown at your neighborhood multi-plex these days. A lost gem that you should definitely check out to remind you of what a real thriller is.  You will not regret it.",1061078400,47,1622,4.452702702702703

324491,5,6301300548,"My brother and I stumbled upon this movie perhaps ten years ago, and it has stuck with us ever since. We were children at that time- I was maybe ten and he seven, which goes to say that our memories weren't so hot during that time, but we remembered this movie with a chilling eeriness. It hit me so much that it actually wormed its way into my dreams at times, and I began to mix it with fantasy rather than reality, since the video disappeared completely after we viewed it, never to be seen again. But we never forgot it, which is instant proof of just how powerful it was.
My brother stuck with the hope of finding this movie again, and he did. He found it, we purchased it from Amazon, and when I watched it again, it's impossible to recount what was going through me. I swear every hair on my arms and neck stood on end when Ada- the grandmother- grabs Niles's head and turns it towards his twin brother Holland's grave. Suddenly everything made sense. Nobody ever talked to Holland except for Niles. Poor Niles was so traumatized by his twin's death that he chose to play ""The Game"" every day, thinking his twin was still there when he wasn't. Except it wasn't a game anymore.
""The Omen"" and ""The Exorcist"" doesn't even begin to compare with this truly, truly disturbing and psychological film. Sure, the films have a terror all of their own, but they deal with Satan, who gets to be grossly overrated in media nowadays. This is a story of pure trauma and parapsychology, and what's so disturbing about it is that Niles couldn't help it, the horror was all too real for him to deal with. I can't exactly pin down this film, all I can say is that it will stay with you for a very, very, very long time. I still can't get why this film doesn't have a more promising effect on the general public. That the entertainment industry chooses to promote hackneyed and seriously vacuous movies (not films)such as ""I Know What you did Last Summer"" and ""Scream"" and just gloss over ""The Other"" is hardcore proof that the media moguls really don't know what the hell they're doing...",1055376000,7,2077,4.439790575916231

324493,5,6301300548,"This in my opinion is one of, if not the greatest horror film(s) of all time.
I know that is a bold statement, but trust me; this one stands up to the test.
The movie begins innocently enough, introducing us to the two brothers- Holland & Niles, who are playing. But through the brother's dialouge, we pick up some horrible facts about their lives, deaths in the family, and Holland's insistance that nobody find the ring that he gave to his brother. From that point on, the film messes with your mind. You have to watch carefully and listen to everything being said. I won't say more, for I wouldn't want to rob you of the surprise ending, nor any of the suspense leading up to it.
The acting is excellent, which is rare when you have 2 twelve year olds as the main protangonists. Great script, great everything, this is a must for all horror, mystery and psycological movie buffs.",1049241600,8,882,4.484472049689441

324495,5,6301300548,"NOT FOR THE YOUNGER CHILDREN TO SEE!
  20th Century Fox presents ""The Other"" (1972).
  I first saw this movie when I was a teenager. It was so easy to become engrossed in this thriller.  I had to watch it on television everytime it was on.
  This movie is based upon the novel, ""The Other"" (Fawcett Crest paperback) by author/actor Thomas Tryon, who also was the executive producer and screenwriter of this film.  The book is much more in-depth.
  I will not reveal any of the plot, so you can be surprised.
  The film stars Chris Udvarnoky as ""Niles"" and Martin Udvarnoky as ""Holland"", who previously had stage experience.  They were 10 years old at the time of filming and the movie was released in New York on their 11th birthday, May 23, 1972.
  What really makes this an unforgettable film a pleasure to watch is the fine casting and dramatic talents of Uta Hagen, Diana Muldaur, Victor French, Lou Frizzell and Loretta Leversee.
  The acting from Chris and Martin Udvarnoky is impeccable and are absolutly perfect for their roles.
  The scenes with Portia Nelson as ""Mrs. Rowe"" are memorable.
 Uta Hagen was always a professional performer on stage and film that this role was really her breakthrough role for people of our generation.
  Also in the cast is John Ritter, Norma Connolly, Jenny Sullivan, Jack Collins, Clarence Crow and Ed Bakey.
  After this film, John Ritter went on to star as a pastor in ""The Waltons"" tv series and later reached fame in the character of ""Jack Tripper"" on ""Three's Company""/""Three's A Crowd"" tv series'.
  Clarence Crow who played ""Russell"" was a local boy born in Murphy's California.  The Other (1972) is his only film.
  The cinematography of this film is so beautiful and the location was perfect.  They filmed in Murphys, California to resemble Connecticut.  Connecticut would have been too cold to film.
  Producer and Director Robert Mulligan was related to actor, Richard Mulligan of SOAP (1977-81) and Empty Nest (1988-95) tv series'.

The DVD version will not contain the voice-over ending made for the television version.  This is strictly the theatrical version.
  This DVD version is shown in viewable widescreen.  The unedited print is superb.
  Language options: English, Spanish, French.  Subtitles options: English and Spanish.  No audio commentary.  Theatrical Trailer included.

Unfortunatly, Chris and Martin Udvarnoky never did another film again.
  Chris Udvarnoky was an X-ray technician.  Martin Udvarnoky is a massage therapist.

Don't forget to whistle.

324496,5,6301300548,"This definitely is a thinking person's horror movie.  There are no senseless sex scenes or wall to wall violence that has nothing to do with the movie.  I had to watch the movie twice before I realized the boys ""other"" brother was never there!  Nobody else in the family ever talked to the other boy (the bad one).  It was only when his grandma took him to the church and showed him the grave that I realized that.  I've seen it three times and the ending still makes me think!!  It ranks up there in my catalog of scary movies with The Omen, The Changling and The Exorcist.  The pitchfork scene, the pruning shears (the first time I saw it, I thought that was his fathers finger he was carrying around)I highly recommend this movie!!",1042588800,,734,4.392592592592592

I first saw this in probably '76 when I was in first grade but I never saw it again until 20+ years later and I *still* remembered many parts of it. Must have had some kind of impact on me as a kid. I'm glad I found it on DVD so I can watch it whenever I want.,1524787200,,301,3.646153846153846
7810831,5,6301300548,"Really! Probably one of the most cryptic and revealing lines in a plot rich movie I've come across and may have you watching it over and over to figure out the ending. It brings up more questions than it answers which is an indicator of a well written story and script. And the line is especially brilliant in that it's said without emphasis as everything else as the movie unfolds in a casual conversation between two twin brothers. Watch for it in order to figure out which twin is in control by way of psychic projection called The Game.

First saw ""The Other"" at the theater in '72 at the age of 12. I was totally confused by how the story was told but wanted to see any movie that had kids in scary situations similar in style to ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" directed by the same Robert Mulligan. It didn't disappoint. There's a very authentic look to the '30's era portrayed similarly to Warren Beatty's ""Bonnie & Clyde"". I grew up in rural areas and the carnival scene was one of my favorites. It really captured the creepy""carny"" atmosphere and ambience. And Lou Frizzel's authentic reaction when finding the baby I often imitated as a kid because it made such an impression on me that I remember it 45 years later.

Seeing it again on DVD on an eyeball calibrated 32in HDTV was mesmerizing from the gorgeous color I didn't see in the theater. The innocence of the '30's nostalgic look and natural acting of the smart mouthed, impish twins drew me in while I noted all the antiques that decorated the Connecticut homes. They really put a lot of work in the set design.

But this time as an adult the plot made sense, but I still had to keep my eye on which was Holland vs Niles. The editing is brilliant in making you pay attention. And as I said before The Game complicates things I hadn't noted viewed in the theater. It makes the movie even more richer.

If it wasn't a classic then, I'm convinced ""The Other"" is a classic now.",1518307200,,1933,4.421348314606742
