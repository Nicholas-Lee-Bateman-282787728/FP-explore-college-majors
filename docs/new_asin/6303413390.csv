THE RUNNING MAN (1987) - Arnold Schwarzenegger, Maria Conchita-Alonzo, Yaphet Kotto, Jim Brown, Jesse Ventura, Mick Fleetwood, Dweezil Zappa, Richard Dawson

Very loosely based on a Stephen King novella (written in only 72 hours) and set in the year 2017, here a bored and bloodthirsty society gets their vicarious thrills watching a to-the-death ""game"" between convicts and a team of bizarrely outfitted hunters. Dawson steals the film as an evil incarnation of his jolly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FAMILY-FEUD/dp/B002WBYDG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FAMILY FEUD</a>&nbsp;TV host. In retrospect, a prescient work that includes wide-screen TVs and a malignant version of reality-based broadcasting. Electronic music soundtrack is by one-man-band Harold Faltermeyer, composer of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BEVERLY-HILLS-COP/dp/B00005JKCB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BEVERLY HILLS COP</a>&nbsp;theme. The big opening dance sequence was choreographed by Paula Abdul.

RED HEAT (1988) - Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Belushi, Peter Boyle, Ed O'Ross, Laurence Fishburne, Gina Gershon

Walter Hill dud has Schwarzenegger miscast as a Russian cop sent to Chicago so he can capture an on-the-run drug kingpin. He's teamed temporarily with Belushi, and there's zero chemistry between them. Naturally, these two enforcers from opposite sides of a then starting to lift Iron Curtain immediately clash, but they put aside their differences and work together to nab the bad guy. (It's said that Arnold's character was based on Greta Garbo's performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NINOTCHKA/dp/B0009S4IJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NINOTCHKA</a>&nbsp;(1939). Always knew she was butch, but not to THAT degree!)

TOTAL RECALL (1990) -  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Tocotin, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox, Michael Ironside, Mel Johnson Jr., Michael Champion, Roy Brocksmith

In this explosive sci-fi adventure that unfolds in the year 2084, Arnold is a construction worker who doesn't realize that recurring dreams of the planet Mars are the only vestiges of a past life that's been erased from his memory. Everything that ""Douglas Quaid"" now knows is fake, including his marriage to blonde knockout Lori (Stone). One day, he's given a suitcase containing a video player that shows a recording of himself explaining how his mind's been messed with. Quaid is instructed by this alter-ego to get to Mars ASAP, and thus a blockbuster of an adventure begins. Best of this collection by far, ""Total Recall"" is inspired by Philip K. Dick's short story, ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale.""
