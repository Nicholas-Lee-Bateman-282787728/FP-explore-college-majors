5753492,5,B00CYQXDNE,I have a feeling this season of NCIS Los Angeles is going to be really good. In the first episode my favorite scene is between Sam and Deeks in the hospital when Sam goes to talk to Deeks.

5753494,5,B00CYQXDNE,I thought is was great with a suspenseful ending.  But I thought the ending of season 4 was more graphic than necessary.  A side comment: You guys cut parts or all of scenes.  It's annoying.,1377820800,3,190,4.371428571428571

5753703,5,B00CYQXDNE,"Finally the last mystery from season 1 is revealed. The series began with hints of mysteries about the past of the main characters Sam, Callan and of course, Hetty. Slowly over the course of the seasons, all the mysteries were revealed. Hetty still has a few mysteries up her sleeve but her character is inherently mysterious. Once the main cast was settled, all had their mysteries revealed until only Callan's father and the meaning of the ""G"" in his name was left. This series finally reveals both and it did not even happen on the last show of the season. The reveal only marks the beginning of a new story arc involving Callan and his father. Callan is not the sole surviving member of his family as he had long thought. He may even be finally getting a love interest. So life is looking up for him in the next season.",1485734400,,823,4.456953642384106
5753704,5,B00CYQXDNE,Good show good action,1484956800,,21,4.5
5753705,5,B00CYQXDNE,"I like the characters development and additional story lines that develop as you go through each season.  Linda Hunt's character ""Hetty"" rocks!  I think the gun battles each episode are a little unrealistic; but overall very entertaining and just gets better and better... I also like the fact if a character does not work on the show... he's gone or replaced. (The regular NCIS needs to take a lesson from Shane Brennan, the creator of NCIS LA, regarding this.)",1483315200,,462,4.8354430379746836
5753706,5,B00CYQXDNE,"Love NCIS LA.. Its my favorite out of them all. I love even more when all three NCIS shows come together. It would be totally awesome to see them do an all-star team show where all three come together to take down a massive terrorist cell that's targeted all three cities. LA, New Orleans and DC.  Maybe make it a 3 show series special with in one of the seasons to do a major promotion for all three shows! That would be so cool! - Josh Powers - Kingsport, TN - josh.e.powers@gmail.com",1483315200,,486,4.282608695652174

I hope she returns, but you killed off Kelly Hu's character on NCIS though I don't know much else you could do, except turn her into an intelligence asset. I still prefer NCIS & I enjoyed NCIS: New Orleans spinoff pilot. Still this a fairly good show, although the hunt for Callan's identity is becoming a bit tedious.",1447632000,,453,4.469879518072289

It's got the right combo of drama, action, humor, and clever plots coupled with outstanding performances by all, but especially Academy Award winner Linda Hunt. I enjoy that they don't use known guest stars to puff up their episodes. LL Cool J and Chris O'Donnell (with help from Daniela Ruah, EC Olsen, Foa, & RF Smith) don't need no stinkin' guest stars!

5754184,5,B00CYQXDNE,"Sam and G. don't disappoint in season 5. They bring you the action and the banter. Deek's is back as well as Kensi. Kensi goes through some serious stuff in this season I won't spoil it for you. Deek's and Kensi who brother and sister in laws in real life, go through some changes as well, I won't spoil that for you either. In real life, Kensi is married to Deeks brother, they  have a child together. Makes that on screen kiss seem a little strange doesn't it? This season is well written and well acted as usual. Let's not forget Hetty (Linda Hunt) she is incredible as expected. Buy it, you will be glad you did.  My only complaint is that the season did not have more episodes, it was just that good.

5754343,3,B00CYQXDNE,"The long drawn out ""Kensi"" theme and the and the sadness of ""Deeks"" is enough to make a fan scream. Every time a producer of a show
listens to the female viewers who seek to unite every character they think fits together, the show goes south. NCIS is successful because the male and female characters are flirting with each other without anything happening, at least that the viewers are told about. If they get too close, they kill the female character. The idea of Kensi being sent to the Middle East  to shoot some terrorist is just plain silly. Then we are told the target Kensi hunting is actually an old boy friend that Heddi wanted to what? Reunite?????. Is she hot for Deeks??? As for the asst. director running around over there he looks old enough to be my father and I'm seventy years old.  Come on! Get some new writers or shut it DOWN.!!!!!",1424217600,,853,4.461538461538462

5754493,4,B00CYQXDNE,"This season started oddly with Kensi being sent to Afganistan for a sniper mission and breaking up a growing relationship with Deeks which I
liked.  But now I understand that she was pregnant in real life and needed  time off.  Ok, but it wasted a lot of possibilities.  But the last part
of the series got really good with some excellent stories including the mysterious box which  has yet to be fully opened.  The actress who plays
Kensi certainly is a woman who I think any man would like to have babies with; just a beautiful woman as well as a great actress.  Anyhow, she
is back with Deeks (thank God!) and we will see what goes from here on.  And the series ends on a very interesting hanger on for next season.
After I finish this I plan to start watching season 6 on my Amazon Video library immediately.  There is an interesting story regarding Heddy which
will continue next series.  This pregnancy situation Is similar to the one with Emily Deschanel over at BONES in season 7.
  There was a kind of ""friendly"" confrontation with Kensi and this DEA girl who knew Deeks well in the  last episode which I thought was very
telling in the developing ""mushiness"" between Kensi & Deeks, and funny too; something I like to watch in all the series of this type.  Beckett and
Castle, Bones and Booth and Lisbon and Patrick Jane.  Its fun to watch these relationships slowly grow and develop.  Hopefully this series will
go on for more years.  In the first NCIS there was a girl called Ziva who was developing a relationship with a Deeks type character named Tony
but for some reason she left the series; the woman replacing her s**ks;  perhaps there was problems with her contract or the producers, but the
series really suffers without her.  Ziva was very similar to Kensi in manners and humor and lovely as well.  I would like her to return to the series.
Anyhow, hooray for ALL the NCIS shows and long successes!!  Enjoy..Four Stars , FIVE with Kensi!!!",1419033600,,1958,4.537142857142857

5754496,3,B00CYQXDNE,"I find the characters of Deeks and the female extremely annoying. Surely out of all the stresses in Los Angeles they could at least find somebody who can actually act!

They have tried to emulate the great relationship between Tony and Kate but on a lower and smutty level.

I enjoy the other characters but because my handbrake (the missus) likes the show i have to sit through and endure the painful other two I have previously mentioned.

I find the story lines weaker and inconsistent. The only 'strong' ones are from the creator Shane Brennan.

A lot of the dialogue is telegraphed.

I also ask the question: How come this crew get involved in cases where there are no Navy personnel involved. Isn't that what NCIS is all about?

In case anybody is interested right at the end of the show there is a cry which states Cooee!

That is an Australianism call to all. Shane Brennan of course, is Australian.

I hope NCIS New Orleans is better than this one.

5754632,5,B00CYQXDNE,"Being an NCIS addict I was concerned that NCIS Los Angeles wouldn't compare but I was wrong, after the end of episode 1 I was hooked.  Although they share Director Vance and occasionally use Abby, it is a totally different format with totally different characters.  NCIS LA take on cases not necessarily closely connected to the Navy or Marine Corp and usually include chasing down terrorists, gun runners and European Mafia.  It's action packed with a capital A and P.  There are 2 sets of partners with Deeks on loan from the LAPD, 2 amazing computer analysts who know no boundaries when it comes to cyberspace and of course the head of NCIS LA, the amazing Henrietta Lang who has been with the Alphabet Soup and NCIS forever, she spear heads the team with her experience, wit and humour.  So if you like fast action, humour and just good old fashioned entertainment, do not miss NCIS Los Angeles !!",1413504000,6,901,4.6415094339622645

From opening scenes to the last ""cliffhanger"", NCIS: Los Angeles will keep you riveted to the screen. The interaction between actors makes you feel and think like the events are real and happening around you. It draws you into their lives, both professional as special agents, and their off-duty personal lives. They all have some interesting quirks to their personalities, and they just reveal a little at a time to keep it 'fresh'. Their leader, Hettie, is the best of them in all ways.",1412121600,,535,4.8901098901098905

5754751,3,B00CYQXDNE,"Let me start out by saying I have not bought this DVD, but have watched the season. The three stars are for several reasons. First it is the weakest season so far. I understand the Kinsi - Afghanistan story line was necessary due to Daniela Ruah's pregnancy but I think they could of done it better. Next - Deeks the degree that he pines for her is a bit much. But the stories back home are darn good. NEXT AND MAJOR COMPLAINT IS THE OUTRAGEOUS PRICE FOR THIS SEASON.

You do have to listen carefully because they interact and play off each other Great repeat on USA Mon night with Callens  ex wife.

5754956,5,B00CYQXDNE,The cast and the crew of NCIS LA still rules and I truly hope that they return for yet another season.  I find the characters to constantly be evolving and growing.  The story lines and the arcs of the series grab your attention from the first episode thru to the next episode.  Can not wait for this series to start up again this fall.  Also hoping that Heddy does not depart the series as she is a joy to watch.  The one person that you have got to love to hate is Owen.  And yes I do find myself loving to hate him.  He is the senior management that you figure tries to put a monkey wrench into the work of the agents out in the field and he has a hidden agenda that we have yet to see fully emerge.,1400544000,2,702,3.9361702127659575

5755595,5,B00CYQXDNE,"The CBS military crime drama NCIS-Los Angeles returns for a thrilling fifth season in 2013-2014, along with its outstanding cast, crime of the week story lines, and hard-hitting action.  The season opens with a resolution of the fourth season finale cliff-hanger, in which Special Agent Sam Hanna (LL Cool J) and LA Detective Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen) were undergoing torture at the hands of a vicious arms dealer out to buy some loose nuclear weapons.  The NCIS team will mount a rescue of Sam and Deeks, but the effects of their captivity will linger on into the season.  The missing nukes may take a bit longer to bring under control.

There are plenty of good plots this season.  The NCIS team will deal with bio- and cyber terrorism, a mole within the Los Angeles law enforcement community, an attack on Los Angeles involving a runaway train, and a missing thumb-drive containing a plan for a terrorist attack, along with a Indian Army Nepali soldier operating far from home.

There are some interesting personnel developments this season.  Hetty Lange's (Linda Hunt) will find her tenure at risk from an old case.  Team leader G Callen (Chris O'Donnell) will meet a man who may, or may not, be his father.  The relationship between Kensi Blye (Daniella Ruah) and Deeks will become much more complicated as Deeks struggles to return to duty, threatening their partnership.  Kensi will be sent off to duty in Afghanistan, turning their relationship into a long distance one for awhile.  Deeks will sometimes have to partner with others, including NCIS psychologist Nate Getz, who makes a return appearance to evaluate Hanna and Deeks after their ordeal with the arms dealer.

Stayed tuned for the excitement and the fun.  ""NCIS-LA: The Fifth Season"" is highly recommended to its fans.",1386201600,15,1797,4.95
5755596,5,B00CYQXDNE,I LOVE THIS THIS TYPE OF PROGROM IT IS BETTER THEN JUST A COP SHOW THE CHARATER ARE GREAT TOGETHER,1385078400,,98,3.95
5755597,5,B00CYQXDNE,"NCIS, LA is one of the best series on TV for many reasons.  Not only is there plenty of fast-paced action and excitement surrounding each week's case, as you would expect from a show spun off from NCIS, but the four investigators combine many lighter moments of humor In the midst of almost nonstop action.  The levity is provided due to two pairs of partners, (Kensi and Deeks, and Callen and Sam) whose characters are extremely well played by each actor (the writers do a great job of giving them well-developed personalities, including various quirks, making the partnerships seem very real. The actors are very skilled, and work beautifully together as a cast, each pulling equal weight in bringing each case to life.  They make it possible for me to believe they are not REALLY actors, but NCIS agents POSING as actors!
  Hetty is the fascinating petite and mother-like, yet lethal-when-necessary leader of this secretive unit. She is a tea-drinking (and scotch-loving- but never out of control!) older and more experienced agent with a mysterious past, who is well-respected by everyone at NCIS.  Hetty is a unique woman with a worldly and ladylike demeanor, yet has the skills to defend herself against any violent personal attack; a sort of ""gentle ninja warrior"".
  Nell and Eric are the duo of tech wizards vital for any of the missions to succeed, and are perfectly paired (romantically as well???). Their relationship, with its dual nature, contributes to the many comedic elements in each episode.
  NCIS: Los Angeles is a perfect recipe of mystery, action, humor, and realistic characters, all elements blending well to make each episode delicious.  Each program builds upon the last as certain story aspects progress, but any episode can also stand alone as a unique case (unless specified).  Overall, the  series is generally not ""dark"", despite the crimes being solved.
