4588020,5,B0056EBHW0,"After being bitten by a 300-year-old Buddhist canine that U.S. government commandos have snatched from Tibet (this is what it takes to make a dog movie exportable?), a workaholic family man and inveterate pooch-hater (Tim Allen) starts scratching behind the ears, hearing high-pitched sounds, slurping milk from the cereal bowl, and licking his wife's face. And the grown-up viewer starts checking his watch. Disney's tried-and-true slapstick material (est. 1959) is here given a heinously unimaginative interpretation by five screenwriters and a director who manages to squander the gifts of an absurdly overqualified supporting cast. The bit players (Robert Downey Jr., Danny Glover, Jane Curtin, Philip Baker Hall) barely clock screen time with the Bearded Collie, which may be co-producer Allen's way of protecting his sleepy performance from competition. Where the original film generously reflected Cold War angst and budding youth-culture dissent, this dad-in-the-doghouse tract could've been made in 1995 . . . or 1985. My eight-year-old nephew sat nearly silent throughout, so when he says he had fun, he must be talking about the treats.",1331769600,26,1147,5.56

I took in these five DVD's over a one week period, I'll never be the same again.
Some of the content is just not funny, that is until you wake up the next morning and reflect back on what you have seen and then piss yourself as it is just that bazaar.
Check it out for yourself if you're game, I farken dare ya!

I'm off to karaoke bub bubs bounce whilst lactating some man milk for my special friends for Chrimbus.

4588022,5,B0056EBHW0,"Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! is one of the only shows I have ever bought the season collection of. It is probably because the show is so ""out there"" and it makes me break out laughing each episode. Plus if you only have maybe 10-15 minutes and you need a good laugh (which tends to be my case) then it is perfect because each episode is about that long.

Tim & Eric's humor has an ADD/stoner-style to it, where each episode is full of usually complete randomness, multiple sketches, songs, and sometimes guest appearances. With this show I'd say you either love it or hate it, there isn't really an in-between...

Honestly it's pretty hard to describe, and a lot of the sketches are straight up insane, but that is what makes this show so unique.",1316390400,15,753,4.449275362318841
4588023,3,B0056EBHW0,"I thought this show was 1/3 total misses, 1/3 lowbrow poop humor (not complaining) and 1/3 genius.  I had only ever seen it after midnight, and if I'm up that late my recall is fuzzy at best.  Watching this during the day isn't the same, it's more annoying but not a total waste.",1439510400,,279,4.245283018867925

4588029,5,B0056EBHW0,"I purchased all 5 seasons. These run the gambit from laugh out loud funny (Chubs, Universe, The Snuggler), to satirical (Dr. Brule, Cinco) to straight up absurd (Cassie and his brother, Beaver Boyz).

If prime time sitcoms and Adam Sandler movies make you laugh, then you won't like this... at all.

But if your tastes run a bit weird and you like more avant garde dark humor then you've found your 'shrimp and white wine'.",1419120000,,423,4.626666666666667

4588034,5,B0056EBHW0,"These guys are hilarious. However, some of their stuff, just goes over peoples heads or is so unconventional they feel uncomforable. Honestly, I think this is the funniest show I've ever seen. I have made friends with people over bringing up this show in conversation. This dvd boxset is full of goofs! One thing that was weird though, is that despite being a box set a few of the dvds were delivered in a separate amazon box.",1387929600,5,426,4.545454545454546

crude humor, not very much profanity. Could use more.",1379203200,3,118,4.95

4588041,5,B0056EBHW0,I think this show is fantastic. Funny original and thoughtful. The characters will stay with you for a long time. This was genuinely a new type of comedy. Tom Goes to the Mayor and Billion Dollar Movie not so good.,1342569600,,214,4.375

8459518,2,B0056EBHW0,"I was glad to get these dvd's, I love this show. The bundle and price was great too. However it's sad the Warner Brothers decided to outsource the manufacturing of these discs, cause the quality is next to dirt. My season 2 disc came scratched and broken, and I bought these new. The rest are ok but are extremely flimsy and the decals on them aren't centered so the discs have a weird stickiness on their sides. I know the distributor doesn't give a s*** about this review but hey maybe I can warn a fellow consumer.",1472515200,3,517,4.34020618556701
