Within 10 minutes I contacted the seller to say my church has also just bought all of the Nooma Series. The seeler would not allow me to cancel.  ALL of the others did.",1278720000,,250,4.1875
8139780,5,B000HI7MPQ,"I have always wondered that if Rob could go back and ""re-number"" the nooma videos so that they felt like they had an order to them, what would that look like? And I have to think, that for me, ""trees"" would be number one. Only because it so beautifully summarizes where Rob is really coming from. At his 2009 conference, Poets Prophets and Preachers he talked to pastors about finding a grounding for your sermons that dwelt in a Gen 1 and 2 perspective. Too many Christians start their story [rant] with ""you're a sinner and you're going to burn."" That's not beautiful, and it certainly isn't ""good news.""

I think the world is growing hungrier for a faith that is relevant today. How am I going to live in THIS world.. right now? Our parents old theology of escapist religion has got to go, nobody wants to sit and wait until Jesus comes back or worse - they die. Men and women want to do something right now - today.

Cause I keep hearing from older people that the world is getting worse...everything is getting worse, TV, morality, politics, fashion, music, crime... and my response is ""OK, what do we do about it?"" I'm not one to sit and watch things burn.

And if Bridget Willard is right and that the ""Church is the human outworking of the person of Jesus Christ"" then we as the church need to do the things that he did.

Heal

Clean

Feed

Forgive

..and maybe then it will be earth, ""as it is in heaven.""",1252627200,,1414,4.370229007633588

8139782,4,B000HI7MPQ,"The guy's group I am leading is working its way through the Noomas. This review and the following reviews I will be writing over the new few weeks will be written from the perspective of a small group leader and aimed at an audience of other small group leaders.

So these reviews will be reviews with a twist :)

As of right now, I own and have watched the first 11 Noomas by myself. I have so far ""done"" the first 3 Noomas with my group. Here are are my thoughts on Nooma 003 -- Trees:

After the great story-telling of Rain and the incredible ending of Flame, I was afraid going into Trees, that the guys would be a little bored by the cinematography. After all, visually, it is just Rob digging some holes and planting a couple of trees. And we all know Rob milks the digging job to stretch things out...

That said, out of the three Noomas we've watched so far, Trees led to the best small group conversation.

To begin with, my guys--being guys--were quite taken with the truck. A pleasant surprise for me...especially as my iTunes would not shut off for a minute and the guys got to watch the Trees menu (which features the truck) as I tried to unfreeze the computer.

As Rob started talking about how the story of Adam & Eve is our story--how we live in a time where we have choices--and how we NEED a faith that is not just about someday, but today as well, I noticed the guys were still interested, still into it.

As we worked through the conversation guide two things happened. We talked about stuff that is and will continue to be life and--hopefully--world-changing for us. We also had a couple of threads in the conversation that pointed directly to the next Nooma, ""Sunday.""

The Noomas are great small group resources. I give Trees my full recomendation. I can't wait to do ""Sunday."" I'll let you know how it went.",1182211200,6,1831,4.41246290801187
