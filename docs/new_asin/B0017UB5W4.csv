8304489,2,B0017UB5W4,Just a trash fix. Betty Page was so much more interesting than this. She had a philosophy that was pretty close to zen.,1362787200,2,119,4.217391304347826
8304490,1,B0017UB5W4,"I thought there would more content.  The same film clips (2-4) were used over and over.  With all of the films she made and pics that were taken over the years she was active,  and this is all they could use??",1349481600,4,209,4.048780487804878
8304491,1,B0017UB5W4,"If you are a Betty Page fan (of which I have been since the first issue of THE BETTY PAGES in 1986), it's likely you've already seen this material.  It's a half assed documentary that is really just an excuse to show a succession of Irving Klaw film clips; the very same film clips that have been circulating for over twenty years now.  They're not even very good copies of them.  I was stunned at how blurry and scratched some of the films were since better copies do exist.  I know, I have them. I will give the film a little credit.  It does start off as a documentary of Betty Page and does include school pictures and family pics of Betty's youth I had never seen before. And we get a pretty accurate summary of Betty Page's life before she took up modeling.  But when it gets to Betty making films for Irving Klaw, the documentary pretense suddenly stops, the narrator disappears, and all the viewer is left with is a short succession of edits from Klaw's films.  One would get the impression that Betty's sole claim to fame is her infamous bondage films.  There is no mention of her work with Bunny Yeager or Betty's television spots or anything of her life after she gave up modeling.  I have to mention the music.  The Klaw films were silent so the brains behind this quickie added some ragtime piano as a soundtrack.  It's horrible, inappropriate, and intellectually insulting!  These films are from the 50's.  Why play music from the 20's and 30's?  They are not silent films from the silent film era!  The people who made this film just did not care.  The whole thing comes across as something some nerd put together on a computer and decided to make a quick buck. Betty Page deserves better. Oh, and the title...Betty Page is not nude in any of the Irving Klaw films and apparently the film makers don't have any nude films from private collections...so, why call it The Naked Truth? Just to tease you and take your money. Resist.

UPDATE 6-19-14: Many of Betty's Irving Klaw film are available on YouTube for FREE! along with the documentary Betty Page Reveals All which is available in it's entirety. I have put my own Betty Page compilation on YouTube ([...]) which features better music, better video quality, and nudity. It can be found under the tag 'Irving Klaw' and is called Betty Page TV. Enjoy, copy, share and please let me know what you think.",1348790400,8,2369,4.536470588235294
8304492,3,B0017UB5W4,"While there was some interesting footage of Bettie I had not seen before, the video is a mere 58 minutes long. Also, it is padded in that many of the scenes are repeated, sometimes twice, as is the soundtrack. Basically, a collection of images with a little spoken word biography. If you're a Bettie Page diehard you'll probably want this, but for someone with a casual interest, you're better off elsewhere.",1230768000,3,408,4.76056338028169
8304493,5,B0017UB5W4,This is the best Betty Documentary Ever I love Betty Page and have been a fan for over 30 years and this is hands down the best thing going. The footage of her is great some great stuff from old camera club loops. Footage and photos I have never seen before COOOOL STUFF....,1209427200,4,274,4.188679245283019
