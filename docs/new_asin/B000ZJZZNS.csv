8235702,1,B000ZJZZNS,"This review refers to the JPO Films edition, with the name RAZZIA in black against a strip of red background. Although Amazon's main description says ""(French Only)"", it says ""Subtitles: English"" under ""Product Details"" (at least as of today it does). Usually the Product Details are pretty accurate, and I figured that a NTSC Region 1 disc would naturally have subtitles. I thought the main description might have referred to an earlier edition. Alas, this is not the case. Although a North American edition, it is Canadian and is apparently intended for French-speaking Canadians.
 In spite of the statement in Product Details, this disc DOES NOT have English subtitles! I returned my copy for a refund.",1478649600,,705,5.077586206896552
8235703,5,B000ZJZZNS,"During the 1950s I saw this film in a local movie house in New York City. I'd been impressed by it, and when I saw that it was available on DVD, I bought it. It's still as entertaining as it was 50 years ago.",1300320000,,208,3.75
8235704,3,B000ZJZZNS,A terrific French noir gangster classic that really needs a digital overhaul. For those that can wait for an ENGLISH subtitles version do so.,1238630400,,141,4.916666666666667
