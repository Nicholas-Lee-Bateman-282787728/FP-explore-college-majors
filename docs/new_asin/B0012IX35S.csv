3090593,1,B0012IX35S,"This ranks as the worst movie/ boxed set I have ever owned.  The story line is non existant, the photography is horrible (couldn't the director afford a tripod or a few extra lights?) and the main actress is so full of herself the movie went even further south than the rating scheme above is able to credit.  Supporting characters are plastic imitations of the old horror movie disposable character; just before they get slashed; only they don't go away.

3090597,3,B0012IX35S,"Freely adapted from its Jimmy Palmiotti and Joe Quesada-penned comic book origins and stylings, Painkiller Jane is definitely not the worst original series to hit the Sci-Fi Channel, and is good mindless fun for what it's worth.  Terminator 3 and Bloodrayne hottie Kristanna Loken is Jane Vasco; a DEA agent that is recruited by a government agency.  She now finds herself hunting genetically altered and enhanced criminals, or ""Neuros"", and soon discovers that she too has some strange abilities of her own, including the ability to heal from any injury.  Throughout this first (and only) season of Painkiller Jane, Jane and her crew hunt these superpowered individuals, which leads to plenty of banter, fighting, and explosions.  There really isn't much else to the show other than that, as things pretty much get wrapped up as the series comes to a close with Jane's allegiance coming into question.  Loken, who was basically eye candy in Terminator 3 and had the thankless lead role in Bloodrayne, is pretty wooden throughout the series.  She looks quite good though, and the supporting cast, namely Noah Danby as Connor and Sean Owen Roberts as Riley, are pretty good.  That being said, you pretty much know what you're getting with Painkiller Jane.  It doesn't strike the gold that other Sci-Fi shows like Farscape, The Invisible Man, or The Dresdin Files did and does, but it is mindless, entertaining fun that sadly never got the chance to really grow on what it set up before getting the axe.  All in all, if you're a fan of the comic and missed out on the show when it aired on Sci-Fi, Painkiller Jane is worth a look, but don't expect much out of it.",1202860800,34,1661,4.8

Within the first three episodes you get the idea of what's going on, but realize that it's more lingo than explanation. And worst is lead actress Kristanna Loken - who got her fame being a naked Terminator - seems to be lacking. I thought she would improve as an actress over time, but it seems to have reversed. Maybe she was affected by her time working with industry hack, Uwe Bolle. In any case, not to just appear like I'm bashing, Kristanna is effectively pedestrian in her performance. She kind of walks... nee sleepwalks through her parts. The other actors as well, while maintaining some form of characterization, just aren't enough to keep me awake. It's unfortunate.

3090657,4,B0012IX35S,"I remember watching Painkiller Jane when it was on the Sci-Fi channel several years ago, and I was sad when it was not renewed for season two. When I found it here on Amazon for $10 I jumped at the chance to have it and have been enjoying it (again) since. It's not the greatest show ever made but it's very different and fun to watch.

Based on a comic book series, Painkiller Jane is about Jane Vasco, a government agent who works with a special team that hunts Neuros, genetic mutants that have astounding mental abilities. In the course of one such hunt, Jane finds out the hard way that she is more or less indestructible - after being killed, she wakes up in the morgue and eventually finds her way back to her team's lair where she makes a full recovery in very short order. Over the course of the series, she is shot, stabbed, electrocuted and subjected to all manner of certain death for most people, yet she heals and keeps on going. In addition, she begins to show other abilities that make her even more formidable. There is a catch, though - she might heal quickly, but she feels all of the pain that these injuries bring with them.

The series does not focus exclusively on just Jane, though. At different points in the series her team members also get their share of the limelight. And, each team member comes with baggage and skeletons in the closet than make them more realistic than just mindless drones who are there to rigidly do a job with no emotion. Believable and meaningful relationships are built between the team members which makes the show that much more interesting.

The series does get a little preposterous on occasion and sometimes the story line gets  a bit silly or uninspired. One episode in particular, ""The Amazing Howie"", stands out as the one episode that I like the least as its story is the least believable of the bunch.

The acting is average. This series will not stand out for the acting talent of the cast, but it will not distinguish itself for being amateur either.

The DVD set itself is nothing special, either. There isn't a lot of extra content, and what extras there are live on the last DVD of the series. I did not find the extra content to be an incentive of itself to purchase the DVD set, but perhaps others may feel a little differently about it.

It's not a perfect show and it does have it share of issues, but Painkiller Jane is a fun show to watch that ended too soon (a problem I have seen with several Sci-Fi shows). It has mostly interesting story lines, good character development and plenty of action. At the current price of about $10, it's a very nice show to have in the collection and is almost assured to entertain. It's a show I will return to and watch again.",1369612800,3,2736,4.449101796407185

3090663,5,B0012IX35S,"Hi,

Just finished watching all 22 episodes on netflix.

This show was great.  Don't want to give the plot away because with good sci fi watching what happen next is part of the fun.

First of all each show is pretty much self contained.  What I mean is it has a begining and a end.  It is not like some series that if you miss one you are lost.  However as you watch you will see the relationship of the main characters grow and there is an ending to the series.

One thing I liked a lot about the show was it did not play like a soap opera that had all this stuff about the main characters personal life.  Instead each espisode is more like a mission were the team of main characters must stop a sci fi threat and the personal issues are not brought up instead you just get to witness this very human team in action.

Also I really like the team.  Each person seemed real and was able to act and emote very well.  This is a show were the actors were picked for their acting ability first and they also looked the part, but the acting was priority.

Also each episode was done very well.  Out of all 22 I didn't think any were filler.

Also I liked the fact that the violence was there but not sick, also their was not cussing or God's name in vain.

I originally wanted to watch it because the hot Kristina Loken from Terminator 3 was in it, but it turned out to be so much more.

Highly recommeded,

One of the reasons I was excited about this show was because it had the lovely Kristanna Loken as Jane, maybe it was the character she was playing but it looked like she plumped up before this series and was in need of some Jenny Craig.

The acting was OK but you could tell by the third episode why this show only lasted one season.  Too bad because there was a good idea behind the story, I think this show was doomed by the unimaginative writers.",1267920000,,698,4.421875

Then things changed, unfortunately not for the better. Although the show continued to be very entertaining the last 1/3 of the series appears as if the writers tried to make the show more mysterious, more sci-fi. It didn't work. Kristanna Loken is absolutely smoking in this series as Jane.

The storylines were very interesting, especially in the first half of the season. Each episode was sort of an ""monster of the week"" scheme where the team would search and apprehend that week's monster or rather ""neuro"".

The series is about the main character, Jane Vasco, who can get shot, burned, fall of 80 story buildings and not die. She will get hurt, and will have a wound, but it will heal. She will still suffer the pain of the wound too. She gets recruited into a secret branch of the government tasked with capturing neuros (people with special abilities). They neutrolize them and ship them off to a facility.

The show also dealt with Jane's realization as to what she was and her potential powers. Towards the end, the show became a bit more confusing and tried to pursue too many conspiracy theories at the same time.

3325094,3,B0012IX35S,"Freely adapted from its Jimmy Palmiotti and Joe Quesada-penned comic book origins and stylings, Painkiller Jane is definitely not the worst original series to hit the Sci-Fi Channel, and is good mindless fun for what it's worth.  Terminator 3 and Bloodrayne hottie Kristanna Loken is Jane Vasco; a DEA agent that is recruited by a government agency.  She now finds herself hunting genetically altered and enhanced criminals, or ""Neuros"", and soon discovers that she too has some strange abilities of her own, including the ability to heal from any injury.  Throughout this first (and only) season of Painkiller Jane, Jane and her crew hunt these superpowered individuals, which leads to plenty of banter, fighting, and explosions.  There really isn't much else to the show other than that, as things pretty much get wrapped up as the series comes to a close with Jane's allegiance coming into question.  Loken, who was basically eye candy in Terminator 3 and had the thankless lead role in Bloodrayne, is pretty wooden throughout the series.  She looks quite good though, and the supporting cast, namely Noah Danby as Connor and Sean Owen Roberts as Riley, are pretty good.  That being said, you pretty much know what you're getting with Painkiller Jane.  It doesn't strike the gold that other Sci-Fi shows like Farscape, The Invisible Man, or The Dresdin Files did and does, but it is mindless, entertaining fun that sadly never got the chance to really grow on what it set up before getting the axe.  All in all, if you're a fan of the comic and missed out on the show when it aired on Sci-Fi, Painkiller Jane is worth a look, but don't expect much out of it.",1202860800,34,1661,4.8

And worst is lead actress Kristanna Loken - who got her fame being a naked Terminator - seems to be lacking. I thought she would improve as an actress over time, but it seems to have reversed. Maybe she was affected by her time working with industry hack, Uwe Bolle. In any case, not to just appear like I'm bashing, Kristanna is effectively pedestrian in her performance.

3325154,4,B0012IX35S,"I remember watching Painkiller Jane when it was on the Sci-Fi channel several years ago, and I was sad when it was not renewed for season two. When I found it here on Amazon for $10 I jumped at the chance to have it and have been enjoying it (again) since. It's not the greatest show ever made but it's very different and fun to watch.

Based on a comic book series, Painkiller Jane is about Jane Vasco, a government agent who works with a special team that hunts Neuros, genetic mutants that have astounding mental abilities. In the course of one such hunt, Jane finds out the hard way that she is more or less indestructible - after being killed, she wakes up in the morgue and eventually finds her way back to her team's lair where she makes a full recovery in very short order. Over the course of the series, she is shot, stabbed, electrocuted and subjected to all manner of certain death for most people, yet she heals and keeps on going. In addition, she begins to show other abilities that make her even more formidable. There is a catch, though - she might heal quickly, but she feels all of the pain that these injuries bring with them.

The series does not focus exclusively on just Jane, though. At different points in the series her team members also get their share of the limelight. And, each team member comes with baggage and skeletons in the closet than make them more realistic than just mindless drones who are there to rigidly do a job with no emotion. Believable and meaningful relationships are built between the team members which makes the show that much more interesting.

The series does get a little preposterous on occasion and sometimes the story line gets  a bit silly or uninspired. One episode in particular, ""The Amazing Howie"", stands out as the one episode that I like the least as its story is the least believable of the bunch.

The acting is average. This series will not stand out for the acting talent of the cast, but it will not distinguish itself for being amateur either.

The DVD set itself is nothing special, either. There isn't a lot of extra content, and what extras there are live on the last DVD of the series. I did not find the extra content to be an incentive of itself to purchase the DVD set, but perhaps others may feel a little differently about it.

It's not a perfect show and it does have it share of issues, but Painkiller Jane is a fun show to watch that ended too soon (a problem I have seen with several Sci-Fi shows). It has mostly interesting story lines, good character development and plenty of action. At the current price of about $10, it's a very nice show to have in the collection and is almost assured to entertain. It's a show I will return to and watch again.",1369612800,3,2736,4.449101796407185

3325160,5,B0012IX35S,"Hi,

Just finished watching all 22 episodes on netflix.

This show was great.  Don't want to give the plot away because with good sci fi watching what happen next is part of the fun.

First of all each show is pretty much self contained.  What I mean is it has a begining and a end.  It is not like some series that if you miss one you are lost.  However as you watch you will see the relationship of the main characters grow and there is an ending to the series.

One thing I liked a lot about the show was it did not play like a soap opera that had all this stuff about the main characters personal life.  Instead each espisode is more like a mission were the team of main characters must stop a sci fi threat and the personal issues are not brought up instead you just get to witness this very human team in action.

Also I really like the team.  Each person seemed real and was able to act and emote very well.  This is a show were the actors were picked for their acting ability first and they also looked the part, but the acting was priority.

Also each episode was done very well.  Out of all 22 I didn't think any were filler.

Also I liked the fact that the violence was there but not sick, also their was not cussing or God's name in vain.

I originally wanted to watch it because the hot Kristina Loken from Terminator 3 was in it, but it turned out to be so much more.

Highly recommeded,

The storylines were very interesting, especially in the first half of the season. Each episode was sort of an ""monster of the week"" scheme where the team would search and apprehend that week's monster or rather ""neuro"".

The series is about the main character, Jane Vasco, who can get shot, burned, fall of 80 story buildings and not die. She will get hurt, and will have a wound, but it will heal. She will still suffer the pain of the wound too. She gets recruited into a secret branch of the government tasked with capturing neuros (people with special abilities). They neutrolize them and ship them off to a facility.

The show also dealt with Jane's realization as to what she was and her potential powers. Towards the end, the show became a bit more confusing and tried to pursue too many conspiracy theories at the same time.
