8217086,1,6303210376,Wasted alot of time talking about what he likes to do. Doesn't get into details of the swing or the concepts of the swing.,1001548800,4,122,4.125

8217088,2,6303210376,"I was so upset after seeing this video that I just have to get my two cents in!  I am a baseball mom that only knows what my 2 boys (9,12) tell me about some of the more difficult fundamentals of the game.  Luckily  while shopping online for a baseball intructional we didn't see this video  first or they might have jumped all over it. Instead we immediately chose  the number one hitting video in the nation, ""Batting A Thousand"".  Believe me! After watching Tony Gwynn's video at a friends house, I  couldn't beleive it. ""Batting A Thousand"" is definitely taking  the world by storm for a reason.  After the press touted ""Batting A  Thousand"" as the first ""genuine"" pro hitting video baseball  has seen in ages, I figured it was just good advertising.  No Way! These  guys are the real deal! Pro players giving it to you straight, no waisted  time on cameos buy washed up has-beens. I have even learned a thing or two  and my boys can't stop watching it. D&D Baseball also has five other  titles....my shopping is done for the year!  A Happy Baseball Mom!",955584000,10,1058,4.484210526315789
8217089,1,6303210376,"I am very disappointed in ""Tony Gwynn's The Five Keys To Hitting - The King of Swing"".  There is precious little instruction content on hitting in this video.  What secrets Tony Gwynn knows about hitting and  drills - he kept to himself.  The video is 30 minutes long of which 10  minutes is devoted to introducing us to Special Guests and other unknowns  who offer zero to the subject matter.  Another 19 minutes is devoted to  telling us what a great guy Tony Gwynn is, and how hard it is to travel all  the time.  A full one minute is devoted to actual hitting instruction, and  there is no content provided that is not already know by any first year tee  baller.  The bloopers at the end of the production just demonstrate how  Gwynn treated the making of this video as a joke.  This video was a  complete waste of time and not even worth a free viewing of the tape.",943833600,18,870,4.3105590062111805
