is by far...

The: VERY BEST  OUT THERE -- ON THE SUBJECT OF MARCO POLO !!!!
I  WOULD  100 %  RECOMMEND THIS  VERSION OF THE STORY -- RE: MARCO  POLO'S  LIFE.

IT KIND OF STARTS OUT SLOWLY, From  MARCO' S  EARLIER Years...
THEN...
His  Story, Really  Gets Interesting -- After The Polo's  (Father/ Uncle and Marco)  Meet The Great  Kubli Khan ...
in  Outter  Mongolia  China.  It was in CHINA , that Marco learned about Pasta, Heating Coal, Silk worms to Make Material For Beautiful Clothes, Paper Money, Rice, Chop Sticks, Fruits & Vegetables, Gardens, Many Different Kinds of Art Work, Gold, Horses, Fire Works, Corrupt  Power, Family Loyalty, Flowers, Plants,  etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

We --- In The Entire World, Learned So Much, Because Of Marco Polo.
> MARCO POLO,  WAS  AND  STILL IS >>>>> SO MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE THEN CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS <<<<

Plus,  Marco Polo Was An Easy Going,  Kind, Caring, Super Intelligent, Compassionate, Open Minded, Funny, Man...
Who Brought To  The World ---  The Knowledge Of Things, He Had Seen, First Hand Knowledge.....  And Wrote About.
He Also Drew Accurate  Maps,  Pictures, Diagrams ---
Of  EVERYTHING  HE  SAW... WITNESSED, and
EVEN  THEN  ---  WAS STill NOT BELIEVED.....  BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH !!!!

 But, WHen He Came Back To Venice Italy, The CHURCH  and The  Powers That Be... Didn't Believe Him...
 EVEN THOUGH, He HAD  100 % PROOF --- (OF--  A LOT OF THINGS, HE HAD SEEN --
NOT EVEN ALL OF THE THINGS  HE SAW.....)  THEY  STILL  REFUSED TO BELIEVE HIM...

THEN,  They Threw Him In Prison, For Many Years ---
THEY CALLED HIM MARCO THE MILLIONS... BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HE HAD TOLD THEM A MILLION LIES... !
But, IT WAS ALL -- LATER PROVED... MARCO POLO WAS RIGHT -- HE DID TELL THE TRUTH !!!!

>>> GREAT HISTORY  LESSON  --- LONG< BECAUSE IT IS  A MINI SERIES -- BUT, WELL WORTH THE MANY HOURS TO WATCH !!!",1246320000,,1953,4.659701492537313
3063387,3,B001190SGK,"I loved Marco Polo when it came out on television in 1982. When I found this on Amazon I was thrilled and I watched it as soon as it arrived.  I am very happy to at last have my own copy at a very reasonable price but am throughly disappointed with the video quality or better said, the lack of video quality.  The sound and music are fine as far as I can tell.  But the picture is dark without proper contrast.  Across my screen I can see what appears to be, for lack of a better term, a ""dirty screen"" with black ""debris"" that obscures the film and darkens it. If I did not want to have my own copy so badly I would have returned it.  I wonder if this is a bad DVD or if all are the same.  I would love to have a first class DVD, which is what I expected, instead of what I received.  If I could swap it out with the supplier for a good copy I would do it in an instant. What should I do?

3063389,5,B001190SGK,For years we watched this movie on our copy in BETA. It's quality was fair but not up to today's standards. Several years ago I tried to find a new copy on the iternet to no avail. Now we have an up to date DVD and am very pleased to report it is a pleasure to view it in now. Thank you to the producers of this fine DVD.,1233273600,,321,3.6666666666666665
3063390,5,B001190SGK,This mini series was the greatest ever made for the story of Marco Polo. I would recommend it to all lovers of great stories.,1232323200,,125,4.25
3063391,4,B001190SGK,"I watched the original TV broadcasting of this title on NBC in 1982 which was one of the first TV mini series came along. I was then instantly glued to it, and the impact I got has been with me ever since. I was at a college in Boston back then. On a daily basis I, as a student from the far east, was learning different views by people from different cultures - people not only from the US but also from across the world. It was a challenge and mind-expanding experience, especially for a student at my early 20's, to open mind and listen to people from different backgrounds. Thankfully, I learned a lot by doing that, which completely changed my life ever since and has been helping me even today. Marco Polo had been through a sort of the same experience the other way around in a whole another level 700 years ago. I can only imagine, but am pretty sure, his respectful attitude toward different cultures allowed him to survive his long journey and also to enrich the rest of his life. To me, he was an astronaut in the 13th century, encountering all kinds of aliens with different languages and cultures, and later teaching us to have objective and broad views above all.

I think this is one of the best titles on Marco Polo. A portrait of Marco's legendary journey not only from a historical point but rather more from a cynical point of view on narrow minded Venetian authorities and corrupted Christianity back then. Every scene would give you the ""medieval painting"" impression or the like with a great film scoring by Enrio Morricone. Superb acting by Ken Marshall along with Denholm Elliott (as Marcus Brody in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"") A blind Japanese pottery craftsman talking about a country of gold is played by late Tetsuro Tanba who also played a role - Mr. Tanaka the secret agent in one of the 007 series, ""You Only Live Twice"". Burt Lancaster, Leonard Nimoy, F. Murray Abraham (in ""Amadeus""), David Warner, Ruocheng Ying (in ""The Last Emperor"") and James Hong (in ""Golden Child"") also play the key roles.

Regarding the DVD quality, I can tell it is not a copy from VHS. It's simply a copy from the early 80's production but finally in the NTSC format. Like its PAL cousin, though it doesn't capture the entire original broadcasted production, I am glad to own a NTSC copy.

""Take my hand, Marco. Remember, when a Mongol takes you by the hand, some of his spirit passes over to you."" said by Kublai Khan still echos in my heart.",1226966400,46,2463,4.5303370786516854
3063392,4,B001190SGK,"I began watching this selection as soon as I received it in the mail.  I have no complaints at all about the mini-series itself.  My only disappointment is that the video quality is not as good as I expected it to be for DVD.  It seems as though it was copied to DVD directly from a VHS master rather than being digitally remastered and/or enhanced for DVD.  I have had to do a lot of contrast and color adjusting and there is some inconsistency from scene to scene.  I finally was able to get the settings on my Samsung DVD player and HDTV to a point where the picture is pretty decent (although not much better than on a standard TV), although some scenes are still a little too dark.  I do of course have to take into consideration that this was a made for TV production from the 1980's.  So, all things considered I think I received a decent value for my money and am satisfied overall.  I would rate the production itself as 5 out of 5, and the picture as a 3.8 out of 5.  I would recommend it to others, but with the caveat not to expect the picture quality you see in more current productions.",1224720000,17,1100,4.2
3063393,5,B001190SGK,"I believe we got the last set of DVDs available of this movie and we're glad we did.  This was a replacement for the VHS tapes we made when the mini-series first aired on TV in 1982.  The tapes are still okay, but the DVD is much better plus we don't have all the commercials.  They said it was used once, but it's the same as brand new.  It was hard to find in NTSC (U.S.) format, so we were lucky.  There are several of this same version available in the European PAL format, but you can't play them on American equipment.  Hopefully, this same provider (Table 42) will be able to get some more DVDs of this movie because it's well worth having.  They said it had Chinese subtitles which can be turned off.  Whoever played it first apparently turned them off because we never saw them, so that was not a problem.  The movie covers the life of Marco Polo in fascinating and entertaining detail with an excellent cast of characters.  At almost 8 hours long, it keeps you glued to the TV throughout.",1199404800,20,998,4.317204301075269

We are glad to have a decent copy on DVD after all these years.  Stunning scenery and costumes.  I would call this version of Marco Polo a romantic version in keeping with what we have heard in the past.  I am now watching a newer version on Netflix, which I think would be closer to how things might have been.  The actor portraying Kublai in this version looks exactly like the portraits we have seen of Kublai.",1427760000,,538,4.134615384615385

3063456,4,B001190SGK,"I had been hunting for this mini-series dvd for several years when suddenly it was available everywhere.  The quality was about the same as other tv shows back in the day (ie: I CLAUDIUS). Nothing special, kind of grainy, not remastered & the sound was very AM Radio. But, that's not why I purchased it. It was for the Story & the Acting.  The list of starts is long, albeit Anne Bancroft as the mother was a stretch.  I'd forgotten many of the stars in it. Basically, I got it because at the time it was made, it was the MOST expensive Mini-Series ever made, this even after Shogun was released.  Polo did get the best ""costume"" emmy that year. It was a great FILLER tv show for us to watch this ""end of summer"" content of TV shows before the new season started this fall. It's now part of a collection of Mini Series in our DVD library.  I recommend it highly, despite it's flaws.",1381795200,,882,4.289156626506024
3063457,5,B001190SGK,"I saw this 1982 miniseries on the famous medieval Venetian explorer of the Far East as a teenager and I loved it. The great story of Marco Polo done in this international co production with a great cast, great locations (in Italy, Morocco and Inner Mongolia in China), great historical reconstruction of the era, great storytelling, faithfulness to the original material. The little known actor Kenneth Marshall stars as Marco Polo. Denholm Elliot is his father Niccolo. Anne Bancroft is his mother. John Gielgud has a cameo as the Doge of Venice. Burt Lancaster is Pope Gregory X. Despite its many virtues, this miniseries has become quite hard to find and it is not usually aired on TV on reruns.",1380931200,,698,4.825
3063458,5,B001190SGK,"Marco Polo is my favorite DVD of all time.  When viewing the film, you feel as if you are traveling with Marco.  The scenery is breathtaking.  I hope to visit China one day.",1380067200,,173,4.181818181818182
3063459,5,B001190SGK,"I saw this the first time it was broadcast, and loved it. I bought the book by Keith Miles, and found it fascinating as well. While I have read the book many times since I first saw the movie, it was with great joy that I found the movie on DVD. Watching it again, I remember why I loved it the first time, and that feeling remains today. It is an accurate depiction of the world that existed in the time of Marco Polo, from the wonders and problems of medieval Christians who wished to limit knowledge yet kept a time of faith alive to the Crusades, which had fanatics on both sides to the wonders and sorrows of China under the Mongols. The movie speaks of the problems caused by fear, and that only knowledge and love will conquer it. It showed me that being different doesn't make something right or wrong, good or bad, just different. There are many roads to knowledge, and each will take their own path. The music by Enrio Morrecone remains as wonderful as I remembered it, and everything else from acting to sets to costumes was kept to high standards. I'm glad to have this in my library and I know I will watch it again many times. I have always loved history, and this movie reinforces that feeling. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to know what it was like for Marco Polo and the people he met along his journey.",1376784000,3,1326,4.308
3063460,5,B001190SGK,I expected this magnificent TV series for years until it was available and I noticed that existed in the market.,1372636800,,112,4.65
3063461,5,B001190SGK,"Yes, my friends, this is the epic ""Marco Polo"" mini series from 1982, aired in North America by NBC. While NBC had originally aired this production in the U.S., there has never yet been a dedicated U.S.~Canada region 1 DVD set release, likely because of the fact that the series was filmed and produced by an Italian studio (independent of NBC). So, as such, most of us are left sifting through the various international DVD set releases, wishing for the best. In reading various reviews, I had come to the conclusion that most of the European releases have very poor quality video (regardless of whether the format is PAL or NTSC). The Asian market 3 disc release from Taiwan reportedly has ""improved"" picture and sound when compared to the various ""Euro"" sets, but still not great. So, when I found this particular set, by far the newest release having been issued in 2009 for the Latin America market, I took a chance. I am very satisfied with the result.

This particular Latin America market set spans the ""Marco Polo"" mini series over 4 high quality DVD discs (NTSC/Regions 1-6), as opposed to compressing the material on only 2 to 3 discs which has previously been the norm. This definitely helps reduce quality loss, and is a noticed improvement. While not digitally remastered or restored, the overall picture quality is pleasantly ""satisfactory"". When using a nice upscaling DVD player, and viewing on a decent quality HDTV, the picture clarity is definitely ""good"", even when using widescreen stretch display mode (I am using a 47""-1080P display). In my case, I found that setting the upscaling DVD player to ""Dynamic"" picture display, in conjunction with the ""Game"" display mode on the HDTV, allowed for the best overall picture quality. Using those settings, the picture contrast was consistently very good, and the color display was good, as well. It seems as though discs number 2, 3, and 4 have slightly improved picture quality versus disc number 1, however, the picture display offered on disc 1 is certainly adequate and pleasant to watch. Overall, the original ""English"" language soundtrack offered by this set is strong, with crisp and clear verbal dialogue, and more volume amplification than you will typically need. On disc 1, there are a few select scenes where some cyclic muffled background noise is present, however, it never overpowers or detracts from the verbal lines spoken. I didn't notice this effect on the following discs. Throughout the DVD set, the English soundtrack seems to be in very good ""sync"" timing wise, with regard to the video being shown.

This Latin America market DVD set contains very effective menus on each of the 4 discs. These discs play perfectly on any Region 1 DVD player, and nothing within the menu has to be selected for playing in Region 1. The scene selection menus are very responsive and well designed, as are the language selection sections. These discs offer ""Spanish"", ""Spanish with Spanish Subtitles"", ""English"" (original soundtrack), and ""English with Spanish Subtitles"". The menus are some of the quickest responding that I've experienced on a standard format ""DVD"", and even though the menu text is in Spanish, absolutely anyone can navigate with ease. GREAT MENU SYSTEM ! ! !

The ""Marco Polo"" mini series from 1982 is nothing short of an epic classic, and offers the story of Marco Polo's travel and adventure in a very detailed manner. The chosen cast members, quality of acting, on location filming, set props, etc, all happen to be truly top notch and appreciated by virtually all who experience it. This particular 4 disc, Latin America market DVD set happens to be the ""best"" of any of the international sets available.

Once again, this DVD set is fully Region 1 compatible (NTSC), and while not digitally remastered or restored, offers ""good"" picture and sound quality, particularly when using a nice upscaling DVD player and decent quality HDTV (with appropriate settings applied).

GOOD LUCK, and LET YOUR ADVENTURE BEGIN ! ! !",1372291200,5,4012,4.964285714285714

The music, the scenery and the history, everything about this version of the story of Marco Polo made me dream of a time of discovery and real challenges. The picture is a bit dark but not any darker that the original series, it was not enough to enjoy the wonders of the Khan's court or the Tibetan plateau tribes or the Andes monasteries. The colors then come alive as a new chapter begins for Marco (after long travels through danger and disease - a dark time). Definitaly worth owning as this is the one great and realistic version. I received this DVD from Taiwan and although the menu is in two languages (chinese and english) the mini-series is the original version in english with subtitles when english is not spoken (not often).

3063481,1,B001190SGK,"No, I'm serious.  I've recently been thinking about this.

See, there are actually several plots in this movie, but they're all the same thing over and over again:  Marco manages to make friends, save the day, and see justice prevail simply by being honest.  Whether with the Pope, Kublai, those tax collectors in the south, etc.

I watched this series as a very young child and it made a profound impression on me.  Specifically, it convinced me that people in power simply need to hear honesty.  That's all it takes.  Then they'll take you under their wing, give you rapid promotions, etc.

Several decades later I can state with confidence that this is not the case in the world.  People in power don't want to hear honesty.  They'll either think you're foolish, punish you for it, or both.

I read the Venetian Empire by Jan Morris as well as several other books about Venice, but nothing has helped me to understand the Venetian merchant culture like this DVD. Perfect for winter viewing - enjoying it now by the fire. It's also interesting to see what Venice looked like in the 1200's since so many people associate the look of Venice with Venetian Gothic (much later). And WHAT a cast - Gielgud, Nimoy!

What an absolutely marvelous telling of this story with great wonders of the world revealed in all their splendour as Marco traveled.  I won't say in real time, but compared to today's hyper-cutting pace, it will feel that way to the viewer. The rhythm of real conversations, treks, and developing relationships only add to the beauty and inspiration of each place and marvel.

Every aspect of making the exploration of Marco Polo come to life is exquisite. The scenery. The sets and costumes. The acting. The historical accuracy. All these add up to a journey not only for the eyes but for the soul also.

3063503,4,B001190SGK,"Well what can I say!  I was impressed with the reviews on this series and certainly a fan of European/Asian history and travel.
The cast of characters and acting were all very well done--- bordering on exceptional--- I can't imagine watching any other rendition of Marco Polo from now on and not comparing each portrayal with these people.
Marco in the movie, portrayed as the ultimate 'do-gooder', wins the hearts almost to a single man of just about everyone by movies end, from the servants to the ladies, to rice farmers, to the hard lined buddhist monks and of course being virtually adopted by the Great Khan himself......not to mention best-friending the Khans ailing son.  While at the same time, he practically demands the Great Khan show kindness, generosity and fraternity to almost every living thing that crosses his field of vision.

The other characters are perhaps a bit more flawed (and therefore, more believable.)  Not that both actors didn't play his part well, both child and adult.  Marco appears to fall in love with women also faster than a lonely jackrabbit on viagra, and has his share of romances....although arguably meets his match and is outdone by the dozen-wived Mongols.  But who am I to judge?  Perhaps this was his real character, I never met him.
One would have almost expected the wicked steparents after his mothers death, quarrelsome spoiled half siblings, a traitorous companion on his journey or some truly evil nemesis in the Khans court to eventually be vanquished.  But you get none of these age old plots.  At least, as far as I can tell you, without spoiling the movie!

I like the fact that the writers and director of this movie didn't fall into the time-worn American film groove of portraying heroes battling grossly unfair villains apparently bent on destruction for its own sake, and usually meeting their 'just ends'.  There is conflict but mostly just a whole lot of humanity- people being people, doing both good and bad.  With the exception of course being Marco, who is virtually a living saint.  But then, I suppose to an extent, they had to stick to 'the script'- which was written from his point of view ;).

The dvd rendition I got was rather dark, especially in the beginning scenes- and certainly the colors could not be described as splendid or breathtaking.  But, you get used to it and quickly forget.

Its a very good movie, great acting and everyone who has watched it with me has stayed through attentively- not sure if its worth the hefty $29.00 price tag, but then again I have seen TV series DVD packs that have been sold for small fortunes.
Also I noticed at the time there was only 1 copy left available anywhere- another reason why I snapped this up- and now I see there is once again 1 copy available.
Probably a coincidence.........",1249257600,,2809,4.760824742268041

I am very happy to at last have my own copy at a very reasonable price but am throughly disappointed with the video quality or better said, the lack of video quality.  The sound and music are fine as far as I can tell.  But the picture is dark without proper contrast.  Across my screen I can see what appears to be, for lack of a better term, a ""dirty screen"" with black ""debris"" that obscures the film and darkens it. If I did not want to have my own copy so badly I would have returned it.  I wonder if this is a bad DVD or if all are the same.

3297888,4,B001190SGK,"I watched the original TV broadcasting of this title on NBC in 1982 which was one of the first TV mini series came along. I was then instantly glued to it, and the impact I got has been with me ever since. I was at a college in Boston back then. On a daily basis I, as a student from the far east, was learning different views by people from different cultures - people not only from the US but also from across the world. It was a challenge and mind-expanding experience, especially for a student at my early 20's, to open mind and listen to people from different backgrounds. Thankfully, I learned a lot by doing that, which completely changed my life ever since and has been helping me even today. Marco Polo had been through a sort of the same experience the other way around in a whole another level 700 years ago. I can only imagine, but am pretty sure, his respectful attitude toward different cultures allowed him to survive his long journey and also to enrich the rest of his life. To me, he was an astronaut in the 13th century, encountering all kinds of aliens with different languages and cultures, and later teaching us to have objective and broad views above all.

I think this is one of the best titles on Marco Polo. A portrait of Marco's legendary journey not only from a historical point but rather more from a cynical point of view on narrow minded Venetian authorities and corrupted Christianity back then. Every scene would give you the ""medieval painting"" impression or the like with a great film scoring by Enrio Morricone. Superb acting by Ken Marshall along with Denholm Elliott (as Marcus Brody in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"") A blind Japanese pottery craftsman talking about a country of gold is played by late Tetsuro Tanba who also played a role - Mr. Tanaka the secret agent in one of the 007 series, ""You Only Live Twice"". Burt Lancaster, Leonard Nimoy, F. Murray Abraham (in ""Amadeus""), David Warner, Ruocheng Ying (in ""The Last Emperor"") and James Hong (in ""Golden Child"") also play the key roles.

Regarding the DVD quality, I can tell it is not a copy from VHS. It's simply a copy from the early 80's production but finally in the NTSC format. Like its PAL cousin, though it doesn't capture the entire original broadcasted production, I am glad to own a NTSC copy.

My only disappointment is that the video quality is not as good as I expected it to be for DVD.  It seems as though it was copied to DVD directly from a VHS master rather than being digitally remastered and/or enhanced for DVD.  I have had to do a lot of contrast and color adjusting and there is some inconsistency from scene to scene.  I finally was able to get the settings on my Samsung DVD player and HDTV to a point where the picture is pretty decent (although not much better than on a standard TV), although some scenes are still a little too dark.  I do of course have to take into consideration that this was a made for TV production from the 1980's.  So, all things considered I think I received a decent value for my money and am satisfied overall.  I would rate the production itself as 5 out of 5, and the picture as a 3.8 out of 5.  I would recommend it to others, but with the caveat not to expect the picture quality you see in more current productions.",1224720000,17,1100,4.2

They said it was used once, but it's the same as brand new.  It was hard to find in NTSC (U.S.) format, so we were lucky.  There are several of this same version available in the European PAL format, but you can't play them on American equipment.  Hopefully, this same provider (Table 42) will be able to get some more DVDs of this movie because it's well worth having.  They said it had Chinese subtitles which can be turned off.  Whoever played it first apparently turned them off because we never saw them, so that was not a problem.

Watching it again, I remember why I loved it the first time, and that feeling remains today. It is an accurate depiction of the world that existed in the time of Marco Polo, from the wonders and problems of medieval Christians who wished to limit knowledge yet kept a time of faith alive to the Crusades, which had fanatics on both sides to the wonders and sorrows of China under the Mongols. The movie speaks of the problems caused by fear, and that only knowledge and love will conquer it. It showed me that being different doesn't make something right or wrong, good or bad, just different. There are many roads to knowledge, and each will take their own path. The music by Enrio Morrecone remains as wonderful as I remembered it, and everything else from acting to sets to costumes was kept to high standards.

3297958,5,B001190SGK,"Yes, my friends, this is the epic ""Marco Polo"" mini series from 1982, aired in North America by NBC. While NBC had originally aired this production in the U.S., there has never yet been a dedicated U.S.~Canada region 1 DVD set release, likely because of the fact that the series was filmed and produced by an Italian studio (independent of NBC). So, as such, most of us are left sifting through the various international DVD set releases, wishing for the best. In reading various reviews, I had come to the conclusion that most of the European releases have very poor quality video (regardless of whether the format is PAL or NTSC). The Asian market 3 disc release from Taiwan reportedly has ""improved"" picture and sound when compared to the various ""Euro"" sets, but still not great. So, when I found this particular set, by far the newest release having been issued in 2009 for the Latin America market, I took a chance. I am very satisfied with the result.

This particular Latin America market set spans the ""Marco Polo"" mini series over 4 high quality DVD discs (NTSC/Regions 1-6), as opposed to compressing the material on only 2 to 3 discs which has previously been the norm. This definitely helps reduce quality loss, and is a noticed improvement. While not digitally remastered or restored, the overall picture quality is pleasantly ""satisfactory"". When using a nice upscaling DVD player, and viewing on a decent quality HDTV, the picture clarity is definitely ""good"", even when using widescreen stretch display mode (I am using a 47""-1080P display). In my case, I found that setting the upscaling DVD player to ""Dynamic"" picture display, in conjunction with the ""Game"" display mode on the HDTV, allowed for the best overall picture quality. Using those settings, the picture contrast was consistently very good, and the color display was good, as well. It seems as though discs number 2, 3, and 4 have slightly improved picture quality versus disc number 1, however, the picture display offered on disc 1 is certainly adequate and pleasant to watch. Overall, the original ""English"" language soundtrack offered by this set is strong, with crisp and clear verbal dialogue, and more volume amplification than you will typically need. On disc 1, there are a few select scenes where some cyclic muffled background noise is present, however, it never overpowers or detracts from the verbal lines spoken. I didn't notice this effect on the following discs. Throughout the DVD set, the English soundtrack seems to be in very good ""sync"" timing wise, with regard to the video being shown.

This Latin America market DVD set contains very effective menus on each of the 4 discs. These discs play perfectly on any Region 1 DVD player, and nothing within the menu has to be selected for playing in Region 1. The scene selection menus are very responsive and well designed, as are the language selection sections. These discs offer ""Spanish"", ""Spanish with Spanish Subtitles"", ""English"" (original soundtrack), and ""English with Spanish Subtitles"". The menus are some of the quickest responding that I've experienced on a standard format ""DVD"", and even though the menu text is in Spanish, absolutely anyone can navigate with ease. GREAT MENU SYSTEM ! ! !

The ""Marco Polo"" mini series from 1982 is nothing short of an epic classic, and offers the story of Marco Polo's travel and adventure in a very detailed manner. The chosen cast members, quality of acting, on location filming, set props, etc, all happen to be truly top notch and appreciated by virtually all who experience it. This particular 4 disc, Latin America market DVD set happens to be the ""best"" of any of the international sets available.

Once again, this DVD set is fully Region 1 compatible (NTSC), and while not digitally remastered or restored, offers ""good"" picture and sound quality, particularly when using a nice upscaling DVD player and decent quality HDTV (with appropriate settings applied).

doubled to tripled since then and they are pretty hard to find. After all it's an old 80's tv Minisereies complete without the commercials which makes it that oh so much better

The music, the scenery and the history, everything about this version of the story of Marco Polo made me dream of a time of discovery and real challenges. The picture is a bit dark but not any darker that the original series, it was not enough to enjoy the wonders of the Khan's court or the Tibetan plateau tribes or the Andes monasteries. The colors then come alive as a new chapter begins for Marco (after long travels through danger and disease - a dark time). Definitaly worth owning as this is the one great and realistic version. I received this DVD from Taiwan and although the menu is in two languages (chinese and english) the mini-series is the original version in english with subtitles when english is not spoken (not often). The DVD was in good condition (a few one second skips - about twelve to fifteen times - barely noticed) and I received it some two to three weeks after ordering it.",1319414400,,991,4.480662983425415
3297978,1,B001190SGK,"No, I'm serious.  I've recently been thinking about this.

See, there are actually several plots in this movie, but they're all the same thing over and over again:  Marco manages to make friends, save the day, and see justice prevail simply by being honest.  Whether with the Pope, Kublai, those tax collectors in the south, etc.

I watched this series as a very young child and it made a profound impression on me.  Specifically, it convinced me that people in power simply need to hear honesty.  That's all it takes.  Then they'll take you under their wing, give you rapid promotions, etc.

Several decades later I can state with confidence that this is not the case in the world.  People in power don't want to hear honesty.  They'll either think you're foolish, punish you for it, or both.

I read the Venetian Empire by Jan Morris as well as several other books about Venice, but nothing has helped me to understand the Venetian merchant culture like this DVD. Perfect for winter viewing - enjoying it now by the fire. It's also interesting to see what Venice looked like in the 1200's since so many people associate the look of Venice with Venetian Gothic (much later). And WHAT a cast - Gielgud, Nimoy! Anne Bancroft, Burt Lancaster (almost 20 years after his role in The Leopard, another Italy-based film).

What an absolutely marvelous telling of this story with great wonders of the world revealed in all their splendour as Marco traveled.  I won't say in real time, but compared to today's hyper-cutting pace, it will feel that way to the viewer. The rhythm of real conversations, treks, and developing relationships only add to the beauty and inspiration of each place and marvel.

Every aspect of making the exploration of Marco Polo come to life is exquisite. The scenery. The sets and costumes. The acting. The historical accuracy. All these add up to a journey not only for the eyes but for the soul also.

3298000,4,B001190SGK,"Well what can I say!  I was impressed with the reviews on this series and certainly a fan of European/Asian history and travel.
The cast of characters and acting were all very well done--- bordering on exceptional--- I can't imagine watching any other rendition of Marco Polo from now on and not comparing each portrayal with these people.
Marco in the movie, portrayed as the ultimate 'do-gooder', wins the hearts almost to a single man of just about everyone by movies end, from the servants to the ladies, to rice farmers, to the hard lined buddhist monks and of course being virtually adopted by the Great Khan himself......not to mention best-friending the Khans ailing son.  While at the same time, he practically demands the Great Khan show kindness, generosity and fraternity to almost every living thing that crosses his field of vision.

The other characters are perhaps a bit more flawed (and therefore, more believable.)  Not that both actors didn't play his part well, both child and adult.  Marco appears to fall in love with women also faster than a lonely jackrabbit on viagra, and has his share of romances....although arguably meets his match and is outdone by the dozen-wived Mongols.  But who am I to judge?  Perhaps this was his real character, I never met him.
One would have almost expected the wicked steparents after his mothers death, quarrelsome spoiled half siblings, a traitorous companion on his journey or some truly evil nemesis in the Khans court to eventually be vanquished.  But you get none of these age old plots.  At least, as far as I can tell you, without spoiling the movie!

I like the fact that the writers and director of this movie didn't fall into the time-worn American film groove of portraying heroes battling grossly unfair villains apparently bent on destruction for its own sake, and usually meeting their 'just ends'.  There is conflict but mostly just a whole lot of humanity- people being people, doing both good and bad.  With the exception of course being Marco, who is virtually a living saint.  But then, I suppose to an extent, they had to stick to 'the script'- which was written from his point of view ;).

The dvd rendition I got was rather dark, especially in the beginning scenes- and certainly the colors could not be described as splendid or breathtaking.  But, you get used to it and quickly forget.

Its a very good movie, great acting and everyone who has watched it with me has stayed through attentively- not sure if its worth the hefty $29.00 price tag, but then again I have seen TV series DVD packs that have been sold for small fortunes.
Also I noticed at the time there was only 1 copy left available anywhere- another reason why I snapped this up- and now I see there is once again 1 copy available.
