4209176,5,B003VE9WPG,"This is a remarkable film. It was originally screened in 2007 during the BBC's equally remarkable week of gay-themed films and TV programmes to celebrate the 50 anniversary of Wolfenden report. This recommended to the British parliament that ""homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence"". The film takes a tough and uncompromising look at the less attractive side of our homosexual world, made worse by the homophobia that is still rife in our communities. This film will offend many gays, as it makes no excuses for our often wild behaviours; the politically correct will be hiding behind their sofas. None of us want to give any more ammunition to the vile religious right, but neither should we pretend that everything in our garden is rosy. (Or should that be Rosie?) Well written, acted and directed, it should be required viewing for all of us.",1304035200,10,903,4.986754966887418
4209177,2,B003VE9WPG,A decent film of gay London and the lives of single lonely men intersecting with straight friends or couples.  Good list of actors but the plot was all over the place.  A couple of interesting sub plots but for at least half the film I just fast forwarded.,1295740800,2,256,4.3125
4209178,5,B003VE9WPG,"I can't add much of substance that reviewers Hewson and Drake haven't already said.  This is a mordant film that touches on painful truths, both in how gays treat each other and in how the non-gay world treats gays.  All is not golden in an era where gays are gaining more rights, greater visibility, and ostensible social acceptance.  Many people will dislike some of the insights presented here, but when honest with themselves many will also acknowledge that these insights are on target.  A wake-up call and a good film.  Kudos to all involved.  [And seeing Rupert Graves and James Wilby of Maurice interact now that they have hit middle age is an inside irony and a great touch.  The romantic hope of their interaction in Maurice is a telling contrast to the backdrop and emotional tenor of their interaction here.  This particular bit of casting seems to ask, ""Have we fallen from the wistful hope of Maurice to this?""]",1293062400,17,925,4.7375
4209179,2,B003VE9WPG,"This film explores the power of evil and its effect on people.  The primordial evil in this film is anti-gay bigotry.  During the film you can see it morph and mestastasise as it spreads from person to person.  There is nothing enjoyable or uplifting in the story but for some this will be a very interesting film to watch.  Love as a power for good never makes an appearance.  In fact, good never makes an appearance.

If you are looking for a film that explores the power of evil but with a more uplifting message, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shank-Unrated-Director-Cut/dp/B002L1YGRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shank - Unrated Director Cut</a>.

4209180,5,B003VE9WPG,"Whilst the loud voices of gay communities around the world jump on the 'we have the right to be married' band-wagon this movie takes us back to the truth: we have the right to be accepted, the right not to be bashed, not to be pilloried, that we have the right to love; but also, we are obliged to treat others with how we would like to be treated. This is a dark and despairing movie, so far from the West Coast US (or Sydney) gay party-boy image of gay men as it can get and it's about time it was made.

I'll defer to Bob Drake's excellent synopsis above. I'd add that the settings, the cinematography, the nuances and ironies are all first class; the actors superb some of the characters you want to hug, others need a good... no, I won't advocate violence. The dinner party scene juxtaposed to the riveting seduction scene and the reality of the outside world is brilliant.

If you think that we should be accepted; if you think that we have the right to love; if you think that we have the right to be safe........if you think, watch this movie.",1290729600,65,1051,4.303030303030303
4209181,2,B003VE9WPG,"""Clapham Junction"" (2007) could be better titled ""UK Gay Men Behaving Badly.""  It's a collage of different ages and types of men, from a curious and manipulative schoolboy, to a recently-married gay couple,  to husbands cheating on their clueless wives, engaged in various pick-up scenarios in parks, bars, and public bathrooms over a 36 hour period around Clapham, South London.  Gay bashing seems to be a local sport, and the film subjects the viewer to watching two men get brutally assaulted. There is also rampant homophobic comments made by the schoolboy's mother and others (including one of the cheating husbands), making this a disturbing film with absolutely no ""up"" side for the gay viewer, other than a small amount of eye candy.  The degree to which the characters interact in gay cruising, and everyone knowing everyone else's business, seems more suited to a small town than a big city like London.

The acting isn't entire awful, but they have little to work with.  Fans of the gay classic ""Maurice"" may recognize Rupert Graves and James Wilby, although, unlike that earlier film, likely they won't want to be remembered for this one.  If the director is going for ""gritty"" and ""dirty,"" he indeed achieved that atmosphere in this film, and production values overall are good.  What is missing is any reason to actually watch this disaster.  Two stars out of five.",1290211200,12,1379,4.960869565217391
4209182,1,B003VE9WPG,I watched this last night after buying it from Amazon and sitting here still wondering why they ever made this movie. The movie jumped around so much it was hard to tell who was trying to kill who and I guess someone who liked watching gay guys get the stuffing beat out of them will love this but I found nothing to like about this movie at all. I have seen a lot of gay based movies but this has to be at the bottom of the trash.,1289606400,28,431,3.909090909090909
4209183,3,B003VE9WPG,"An excellent performance from all concerned in what is basically, in spite of its hype, a dark homophobic movie intended to make gays go back into the closet and bolt it from the inside.  It concerns a serious of vicious attacks on gays in a particular neighborhood of London, presumably from real events. One is told that ""neighbors"" get together to fight back.  Absolutely no such thing.  Not one single attack is traced to its perpetrators.  What one gets is a bunch of boring homophobic suburbanites having dinner while a gay boy gets murdered right outside. Kudos for having dared to expose the reality of sex between teens and adults.  Many times, the teen is the aggressor, which was portrayed in the movie with chilling and heartbreaking accuracy.  Wilby and Graves, of ""Maurice"" fame, are bit players in this one.  Time has been kind to Graves, not Wilby. The movie belongs to the teen and his adult target. Real chemistry there! I like the movie, not the content.",1289433600,42,973,4.755952380952381
4209184,4,B003VE9WPG,"I have viewed a 90-minute download of the BBC version of this film [as well as this DVD]. A IMDB review of the 2007 BBC TV presentation of Clapham Junction starts, ""Over a two day period a series of interconnected events impact a disparate group of [gay] Londoners,"" and that is quite accurate even if the period is actually about 36 hours.

Clapham Junction is a major train-connecting point in the London Borough of Wandsworth, not far from Lavender Hill, the location of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lavender-Hill-Mob/dp/B00006FMAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lavender Hill Mob</a>, but that was a comedy and this is certainly not.

In 2005, a gay man, Jody Dobrowski, suffered a horrendously brutal murder on Clapham Common, and a similar event is central to this film, which is an ultimately depressing and sometimes shocking exploration of contemporary urban gay sexuality. Some of the characters are deeply unpleasant, dishonest and self absorbed. But you will want to watch them.

One gay youth who play the violin is clearly intimidated and frightened by gangs on his walk to his teacher, while another gay inbetweener embraces his homosexuality and relentlessly pursues an older gay neighbor. Some of the gay yuppies are married but unfaithful to their wives in the type of park restrooms frequented by George Michael, and one who marries his partner dallies with a server boy in the kitchen after the ceremony. It is hardly justice when a gay gay-basher gets bashed himself. And you are forced to watch, or not.

The actors sometimes rise above the material. Paul Nichols is clearly full of himself as his character, Terry, and the scene in which he dresses for a night out is great, though one surprising scene reportedly used a stand-in. The film unites James Wilby and Rupert Graves of Maurice, but their relationship could not be more different than what they had in that film, though both were, again, brave to take their roles. David Leon is powerful in his role as Alfie Cartwright (the Jody Dobrowski character). But Luke Treadway as young Theo pursuing a reluctant Joseph Mawle as Tim is absolutely chilling, and worth the cost of the DVD if anything is.

You will never forget Clapham Junction if you do watch it. But there is some hard-to-watch ""bad"" mixed with the ""good"" (the performances).",1286064000,114,2367,5.169712793733681

4209191,3,B003VE9WPG,"Well-acted, some nice imagery and direction, but sadly wanders into some of the classic pitfalls of gay film and TV: cliche, heavy-handedness, over-sentimentality and soap-opera dramatics. Like many gay-themed films, it focuses heavily on sex, nudity and attractive males... not necessarily a problem if there is a strong script, direction, and fresh ideas. Obviously a selling point of these films is that gays get to see males indulging in romance and sex not commonly seen in cinema, so one can forgive the sometimes gratuitous nudity. Clapham Junction is just well-done enough away to sell it sexual boldness, and the actors do generate a genuine heat.

The film is surprisingly dark, and violent, which i rather liked as a change of pace. But the script veers out of control and pushes credibility: how many gay-bashers are working one cruising park at a time?

Not for everyone, but worth seeing as there are some rather good bits to be gleaned, even if the final product is a bit obvious and preachy.",1434240000,,1007,4.952662721893491

4209193,5,B003VE9WPG,"The situations depicted are carried out with the dramatic excellence of actors who are top drawer.  Action moves from one situation to the next with breathtaking insistence and the beholder is drawn into the action whether he wants to or not.  An absorbing ride through a secret world where life is not ""gay"" but threatening to those who must keep their ""different"" orientation under wraps, cruel in its most sordid manifestations of hate.  Serious, well done.  Perhaps five stars is not enough!",1418947200,,495,5.0
4209194,2,B003VE9WPG,"As I go over the different narratives in this movie, one can't help but feel that none of them are truly ""happy"" stories - or at least they aren't stories with happy endings. And I think that ads to how heavy this movie ends up feeling since the movie ends with everyone being pretty much worse that how they started. Theo's forbidden young love ends pretty lousily. The civil partnership of Will and Gavin seems doomed to fail from the get-go. And then you have Terry terrorizing people left and right - and we don't fully understand why.

And this is why I brought up the whole burden of trying to present something realistic but ending up seeming to be preachy. When there's no positive side to things (and I don't even need a fairy tale ending) one can't help but feel that the conclusion that they (the producers) wanted was something pretty negative as well. Should we not try to get married anymore because cheating is bound to happen? Should we be afraid of other members of the community who are just as likely to commit acts of violence against their own? Should gay children be kept safe from the predatory pedophiles out there even when the boy makes the first move?

Beyond tragic endings, the characters themselves aren't necessarily all that appealing or aren't necessarily guys one can relate to. Then again, with so many people in the mix, it's not like we really know anything about any of them beyond one-sentence descriptions. Alfie is a waiter. Danny is a student who plays the violin. Terry is violent. Beyond this, we don't really know who they are, and that's a shame. I would like to better understand why each of them do what they do - a question that the movie ends up not addressing.

Thus the vagueness of the respective character motivations, the generally  negative tone to things and the convoluted storytelling leaves one feeling confused and unsatisfied by the end of things. Even without a sort of ""happy ending"" I think this movie could have done a lot better in terms of keeping the narrative focus where it needed to be despite the many plots at work. I probably would have cut out a few characters for good measure - not even everyone in my synopsis above really merited the screen time.

Clapham Junction had a purpose in mind - some sort of warning about abuse and the need for people to speak up about it. But wrapping it around an LGBT context may have sent the wrong message in the long run, thus diminishing the movie in turn.",1412553600,,2471,4.568848758465012

4209211,5,B003VE9WPG,"I first watched this British Channel 4 movie a couple of years ago. I was really impressed and ended up buying a copy through Amazon a year or so ago.  So I've been sitting on this review for a while so here goes.  This is the type of flick which causes a lot of controversy especially amongst gay audiences because it brings out some of the worst traits in us: obsessive sex, hypocrisy, unfaithfulness, self hatred, closeted fears.  Well folks, we are human like everyone else and these traits are part of the scene and we have to accept this film as a portrayal of some of us and not a history of all of us.  It's a very effective drama set in London during an uncommonly hot spell - 36 hours where everything's at a boiling point.  It's well written by Kevin Elyot and graphically directed by Adrian Shergold.  And like stories with linked characters and situations, coincidences abound and figure as a main part of the plot, emphasizing really what a small world we live in. Clearly the most intriguing and certainly the most unusual aspect of ""Clapham Junction"" is the relationship between 14 year old Theo (convincingly played by Luke Treadaway who at the time of production must have been 22 or 23) and his 29 year old neighbour Tim (Joseph Mawle) whose murky past inhibits his temptations ... well, almost!  I don't think I have ever seen the desire and lust of a boy for an older man so accurately portrayed as in this production.  And their sex scenes and Theo's horny observations of Tim from across the way are very graphic and I'm sure caused a lot of controversy amongst both gay and straight audiences.  All in all this is a first rate film but be warned, the scenes of violence especially the gay bashings depicted are very realistic and extremely confronting. Lots of talking points for all of us.  Enjoy for what it is, a challenging and poignant drama about people.  Can't live on feel good and bland gay movies all the time.",1393200000,3,1944,4.541547277936963

4209232,4,B003VE9WPG,"An amazing film by the violence it contains. It is both realistic and frightening.

Gay people, young and old, are forced to live a clandestine life with an underground satisfaction of their desires or impulses. They have against them three types of people. The parents, in this case essentially a mother, who cannot understand that at age 14 her son can have some desires and can try to get them satisfied. She is a bigot. If he would look for girls she would just be satisfied but not for boys, what's more men.

The second type of enemies are gangs of gay hunters or in fact hunters of anything that is different and one of their victims is a gay waiter who is just walking home through a common park. He will be beaten to death. Another one is an Asian young teenager who is playing the violin and preparing for some Royal Academy of Music. We only see at the end the smashed violin in some underpass.

The third type of enemies is more vicious because it does not even have the excuse of gang rule. It is purely individualistic isolated gay-bashers who go around, let one flirt with them and then trap him in a way or another and smash him to death. The film has one moment of extremely morbid humor here since one of these predators meet with another of these predators and one will end up in hospital.

Gay men seem to have one more enemy which is among themselves this time. It is unfaithfulness. One couple gets their civil partnership celebrated and while everyone is having fun, the older groom flirts with the waiter in the pantry in the basement of the house. Pretty ugly for that predator of another type, a predator who only has one objective: have his way with as many gay men as possible while his civil union gives him some kind of cover up for his feline treacherous behavior.

That is sordid, bleak, and even morbid in a way. And yet there may be some hope in all that darkness. The hope of maybe some might start feeling differently about it, feeling that all men have the same right to love those they want and want to be loved and to love back. The hope that one closeted gay man might do the right thing and help the police catch the killers who took the life of the waiter. And eventually the second groom of the ""married"" couple coming across the ring he gave his partner on the finger of one of the solitary gay-bashers who got beaten up by the other solitary gay-basher understands that his own partner has given his ring to someone and this ring ended up on the finger of someone who was not at the wedding ceremony or celebration. The police will sort out the rest. That's the hope, but wrapped up in so much muck.

The film is supposed to be based on true facts and to have been shot to help develop a debate in our societies. It sure brings up many questions and no easy answer because you can change the law, you can change the police, you can change courts and judges, but to change the mentality and minds of bigots and hunters hunting human preys for the fun of catching, torturing and then killing those who are dressed to kill in a way and yet are killed by those who are just by-standers who should have let life live the way it wanted to be lived.

Such crimes might finally get down in number and gravity when everyone will have the same rights and the law gives everyone the same dignity and freedom. But it will be long and difficult. Bigotry is alas very well and widely spread and we have not invented yet the bigotry-collecting trucks and machines to get it to the closest bigotry dump.

4209234,5,B003VE9WPG,"I had not read any comments prior to watching this film. I'm glad I didn't because to have done so would have been nearly as confusing as the film itself.

I thought this was a great film and aside from the unfortunate violence (which was not shown, but understood), there were some quite dramatic scenes, and to its credit extremely erotic at times.

The brief relationship between young Theo and the older Tim is not so unusual, but I was pleased to see someone tell the truth about some boys and their ""victim"" adults. I was younger than Theo when I did exactly the same thing, yet if it had happened now, people would crucify that man saying what a molester he was, but he wasn't - I was. I was as relentless as Theo was and just like him, ""no"" was not an option. The film makers knew exactly what I'm talking about because the depiction was flawless. This sub-story was very erotic, but then I experienced it, so it would be.

The disappointing thing was the description of the film's content. I read something about a community getting together to avenge a gay guy's assault. That is not true and the film is no where near about that. This film is so off the charts in every direction it cannot be explained. It's about love, hate and everything in between.

It was also a bit disappointing to find there were no happy people in this film. Gay guys stuck in straight marriages, gay guys getting married while one can't wait to cheat on his husband, innocent gay guys getting beat up or murdered, a boy in love with a man who can't show love in return and so on. It is a fantastic film by all accounts, but there is no happy ending for anyone and in fact, there is no ending at all. It's one of those films where the credits roll and you're like, ""what""? But even with no closure, it is an outstanding film and I thought it was brilliant.",1346630400,,1843,4.333333333333333
4209235,5,B003VE9WPG,"This film is quite superb.  It ranks with MAURICE as one of the best gay-themed films ever.

It begins with a television writer (Rupert Graves) pitching a gay-themed script to a producer--who rejects it out of hand because, he claims, being gay isn't a problem anymore.  For the next 90 minutes we follow the unraveling stories of a diverse collection of gay men, all of which demonstrate clearly and incisively that it IS a problem, in all kinds of ways, and that legalization doesn't really make the problems go away.

The portrait of the various modes of homophobia the characters encounter (some of it internal) is chilling, moving, and ultimately terribly compelling.  Kevin Elyot's script is a marvel in the way it balances and interweaves the various narrative threads, and Adrian Shergold's direction does it full justice.  The splendid cast is led by Graves, James Wilby and Phoebe Nicholls (all from MAURICE); David Leon; and Rachel Blake does a marvelous turn as the straight, simpatico hostess of a dinner party where society's lingering homophobia becomes all too evident.  (The one false note in the casting is Luke Treadaway as Theo, a 14 year old gay kid; Treadaway is just too old for this to be convincing.  He could have played 17 convincingly, maybe even 16, but there's no way he's 14.)

If fluff is your thing--if you're looking for mindless entertainment--CLAPHAM JUNCTION isn't for you.  But if you want a thoughtful, serious, terribly gripping and superbly well-made film with a gay theme, this is not to be missed.",1344211200,8,1540,4.934108527131783
4209236,1,B003VE9WPG,"Given the nastiness of this film, it might have been a flick directed by the Marquis of Queensbury had he lived in the 21st century. Despite a stellar cast and wonderful performances, the work is miserably edited, intercutting scenes of intimacy with jarring socialite prattle, the latter interrupting a scene like some moronic TV commercial. And this goes on ALL THROUH the movie. And the message (if there be one) is ""hurray for me, screw you.""

Two men are brutally murdered - a beautiful waiter following a gay wedding, and a talented black teen violinist who harms absolutely no one. This speaks to violence motivated by people who know they are losers, and so must destroy anyone who is a source of goodness or creativity. But on a deeper level, it is a revealing statement about British culture: the twin delusions of superiority and privilege. Narcissism is everywhere in this flick. A guy marries his partner, then at the event immediately goes after the waiter, giving him cocaine, then forcing sex on him. Men meet in the public bathrooms (""tearooms"") for sex. A man invites another to his apartment after the bar, and the guest beats him up, then leaves. Later, the host returns the favor when they bump into one another in the park. So the deaths of two victims do not stand a chance of getting sympathy amid all these sexual cravings. And, as far as the ""neighbors"" are concerned, they are voyeurs, not outraged citizens who care about others.

Not to put too fine a point on this, this is much more a movie about sexual addiction and dysfunctional behavior than it is about gay bashing. A better cinematic effort that deals with community prejudice is the amazing Swedish film ""Patrik [Age] 1.5"".",1344124800,8,1711,4.777027027027027

4209238,4,B003VE9WPG,"This film was slammed in the UK and buried by the makers Channel 4 because it was felt that it portrayed gay men in a negative way. Yes, it's dark and at times pretty sad but I think it's a very honest portrayl of modern gay life in London. It challenges many stereotypes and asks lots questions. There are no happy endings but it's a good story well told, beautifully filmed with a great atmosphere. And theres a few good looking lads too. Well worth a look.",1329436800,14,459,4.287356321839081
4209239,4,B003VE9WPG,"The movie is very good.  It makes you think.  It brings up some of every gay man's fears, if I go home with him, will I make it home?  I would definitely recomend this movie.",1327449600,5,174,3.914285714285714

Still, it rates a 5 star label. Wilby and Graves are also in the E.M. Forster Merchant/Ivory adaptation of MAURICE which I very highly recommend.",1325376000,,302,4.472727272727273

It was amazing!!!  For that scene alone, it's worth the purchase of this DVD...

4209244,5,B003VE9WPG,"After reading other reviews I am still learning more about this movie. I Netflix'd it, because I saw a preview of it and thought it would be an interesting film. It was. It is kind of a ""day-in-the-life"" film where twists and turns end up connecting the seeming strangers in a very intelligent way that forces analysis and deep thought.  The hypocracy of so many people, and violence that hate creates is disturbing.  So many people want to bury the truth and call victums of hate and bigotry whinners and trouble makers, but this film really forces you to ask the questions the could make all the diffence in a world where a man cant walk down the street or in a park without being attacked.  This film really does a great job of introducing you to its characters and in a sense forming a relationship between the viewer and the character to the point that you begin to feel for them and their situation. This movie moved me so much, I just had to own it.",1306800000,4,956,4.389830508474576
