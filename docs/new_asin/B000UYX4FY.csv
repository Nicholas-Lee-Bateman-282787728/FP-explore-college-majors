8215691,2,B000UYX4FY,"Vietnam vet Ross Archer (Chris Robinson) returns from the jungle missing an eye but still pining for his wife in Florida. She is missing from their houseboat, but he quickly tracks her down. Problem is she is dead the very next day, an apparent suicide. So Archer must delve into her seedy past from the last year while he was on duty to find out what happened. Sounds like all the ingredients for a great sleazy 70s flick, right? Well, you will be sadly disappointed by this one as it is as tame as a TV movie. Robinson - who made the killer snake pic STANLEY the following year - is great as the badass eye patch sporting Archer. Sadly, he only gets a few quick moments to show off his badassery. A character this cool looking deserved a POINT BLANK style film. The mystery takes a few twists, but the execution is rather bland. And nothing will prepare you for the nightclub routine of Joe Ross as alcoholic comedian Maxie Marks. Sidney Blackmer is the crippled old man at the center of the mystery and look for Bill (BLOOD FEAST) Kerwin in one scene as a cop. Director Joseph Adler made a few films, including SEX AND THE COLLEGE GIRL, SCREAM BABY SCREAM and CONVENTION GIRLS. I'm sure they are all like this - great exploitation title with little else on display.",1509321600,,1268,4.446351931330472
