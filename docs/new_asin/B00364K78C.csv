8389486,5,B00364K78C,"When I heard The Hulkster was coming to TNA I was very excited. The changes he made to TNA were not all for the better. People often comment on this as being one of the worst events. Hogan announces on the PPV he's taking the six sided ring away from TNA. That was a mistake and not a way to win TNA fans over. I still love this dvd and I'll tell you why.

  Let's start with the good The Main Event Angle vs Styles was a classic. This was one of their best matches they ever had. Ric Flair is there too to get involved. This was TNA we had the two best wrestlers TNA had to offer going at it. They tore it up and this match alone makes the show worth it.

  The Debut of The 'Mystery Big Name Player' was Ken Anderson who faced Abyss. They put on a pretty good match. I was never too big on Anderson but I changed my mind watching some of his matches in 2010 in TNA. He had some great matches with Jeff Hardy and Kurt Angle. I think winning the world title the next year he proved he was an impact star and helped TNA.

  Beer Money vs The Band. I liked this match. It was great to see Hall, Waltman and Nash back in TNA. I feel though it was not 1996 and they were not in their prime I love The Wolfpac. I loved watching them in the 90s and even during the brief sting in WWE in 2002. Beer Money has to be one of the greatest tag teams in the history of TNA they always deliver.

  Wolfe vs Dinero was a good match. Wolfe was an incredibly talented wrestler and if not for his injury he could have a great career in TNA. We have those classics he had with Kurt Angle to remember him. This was a good match and I was always a fan of Wolfe. I liked The Pope too. He's cool.

  The British Invasion vs Morgan and Hernandez for the tag straps. It was a great match. It was nice to see Morgan grab some gold. He was wasted in TNA and I thought deserved a world title run even if brief. Hernandez was a very underrated wrestler too great to see him grab some more gold.

  Morley vs Daniels was a decent match. I thought Daniels should be the face. Morley was one of my favorite wrestlers from the Attitude Era but Daniels is one of the guys who made TNA and was there since day one. I thought he should be the fan favorite. TNA fans like TNA wrestlers and Daniels simply bleeds TNA.

  ODB vs Tara was a good match. Tara is one of the greatest womens wrestlers of all time. These two put on a good match and I love The Knockouts. ODB is the best too.

  Amazing Red vs Kendrick was great. Red was in TNA when it first started. I think one of The Hulksters bad moves was to move away from The X-division. The X-Division gave TNA it's identity

  In the end I recommend this show. I found 2010 to be an exciting and great year for wrestling. Although the Hulk Era didn't work out it was fun to revisit this era. It was nice seeing Hall, Nash, Waltman and Flair in TNA one more time. I am a big fan of the 90s wrestling and The Monday Night Wars. So it was exciting when all the wrestlers jumped to TNA and there was almost a War but it didn't work out. Cheers and Enjoy the dvd!",1428710400,,3073,3.962540716612378
8389487,4,B00364K78C,"While not a great PPV,it was still better then WWE's Royal Rumble of the same year. The X-Division title match between Amazing Red & Brian Kendrick was a high-flying showstealer. The Sean Morley-Daniels match was pretty good for a mid-card match. The 2 out of 3 falls match for the TNA Knockouts title between Tara & O.D.B. while a good match,it was still one-sided(score-wise). The World tag team title match between The British Invasion(Brutus Magnus & Doug Williams) & the team of  Matt Morgan & Hernandez was not great but pretty good. The Desmond Wolfe-D'Angelo Dinero match was a hard-hitting back-and-forth bout. The Beer Money Inc(James Storm & Robert Roode)-The Band(Syxx-Pac & Kevin Nash who was subbing for Scott Hall) match was above-average for a tag bout. The Abyss-Mr. Anderson(who was subbing for Bobby Lashley) was a hard-hitting/solid brawl. The AJ Styles-Kurt Angle-World title match was a hard-fought,back-and-forth,high-flying,high-tech match even with Ric Flair in it. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1280188800,,1021,5.225609756097561
8389488,1,B00364K78C,"I wasted $34 bucks ordering this PPV, and let me tell you that bringing in Hogan was the BIGGEST mistake TNA Wrestling can make. They brought in Hogan thinking that he is the answer, when he's not. He's on of the guys that Killed WCW, and once he came in along came all the wcw guys who killed wcw..

I am big WWE fan, but I liked TNA because some of their stuff WAS better then WWE.. So I watched this PPV wondering how much change hogan was bringing... let me just say.. 5 minutes in.. I didn't know if I was watching TNA or WCW...

this dvd is not worth anything. its bad.",1268006400,7,575,4.035087719298246
8389489,2,B00364K78C,"This was the beginning of many things in TNA...a new year, new leadership, a new setting, and a whole new direction for the company.  Two weeks earlier, Hulk Hogan & Eric Bischoff made their TNA debuts & positioned as the new men in charge of TNA Wrestling and with this came a bunch of new changes to TNA.  The Impact Zone had a bunch of changes done as the face/heel tunnels where gone & replaced with an entrance way in the middle of the stage, as you walk up from underneath their big screen, along with a ramp to the ring that was level with the top apron (just like the ramps that WCW & ECW used to use).  The biggest change however was the six sided ring being replaced with a traditional four sided ring.  It should be noted that the crowd was very vocal all night against many of the new talents & changes to ""their"" product such as chanting to Hogan & Bischoff ""WE WANT SIX SIDES!"" & having chants towards Brooke Hogan who seemed to get more heat than anyone else in the first few matches, and having certain reactions towards the various new talents who made their appearence tonight.

X Division Champion Amazing Red vs. Brian Kendrick - This was Kendrick's return to TNA as the mystery challenger for Red's championship.  They started off mat wrestling early before pulling off one sick looking oklahoma role.  This wasn't the typical ""spotty"" X Division match as they actually tried to ""work"" here with Kendrick focusing heavily on Red's legs but it was still a fun match & a good way to open the show.

Sean Morley vs. Daniels - For those who don't remember who Morley is, he's the wrestler formely known as Val Venis.  It should be noted that Morley was booked to be the babyface in this match and even gave his trademark towel to Brooke Hogan at ringside but the crowd favored Daniels to the point where Daniels tried to heel the crowd before the match but also insulted Brooke in the process which just brought more cheers for Daniels.  Daniels targeted Morley's throat over with various thrust & chokes and pulling out various moves such as the koji clutch submission & even scissored Morley's head to the ropes with his legs at one point.  This wasn't a good debut for Morley was he was heavily on the defense throughout the entire match and the audience was so upset with his performance that they actually turned their back to him after the match.

2 Out Of 3 Falls: Knockouts Champion O.D.B. vs. Tara - After the various matches & trading the championship between each other for weeks, this was setup to be the final encounter between these two.  Unfortually, this was easily the weakest match between both of these girls (including the comedic ""drunken"" street fight on Impact weeks earlier) as the first fall happened very quickly while the rest of the match was dull & never left ""first gear.""

TNA Tag Team Champions British Invasion vs. Matt Morgan & Hernandez - Eventhough Morgan & Hernandez were only teaming together for a short time, they had the power advantage over so the Brits had to keep double teaming in order to keep an advantage but it didn't work as both men powered their way to the championships.
It should be noted to pay attention for to Taz as he took a shot at Michael Cole during this match.  Also for those that noticed that Matt Morgan almost broke down & cried after winning the titles, his father at this time was ill with cancer and it was an emotional moment for his dad to see him win his first championship.

D'Angelo Dinero vs. Desmond Wolfe - This was a rematch from Impact weeks earlier and before the match, Wolfe debuted a new look that was very ""James Bond"" like complete with his own valet..who Dinero happened to plant a kiss on during his entrance leading to the crowd chanting ""Pope Is Pimpin'!""  Desmond dominated this match against The Pope as he heavily focused on his knee using regular moves as a snapmare into the ropes resulting in bad whiplash, single leg boston crab, STF into unique technical moves & innovative leglock submissions.  As far as pure wrestling, this was one of the best matches of the night.

Beer Money vs. The Band - For those who didn't know, ""The Band"" was originally a Blues Brothers reference from Kevin Nash in regards to reuniting with his ""Kliq/Wolfpac/nWo"" friends Sean Waltman & Scott Hall...however TNA just ran with that & decided to call the group ""The Band.""  This was originally advertised to be an ""Outsiders"" reunion with Scott Hall & Kevin Nash however Waltman replaced Hall in this match.  Beer Money were out looking for revenge for being jumped by Hall & Waltman weeks earlier and they worked over both Nash & Waltman early in the match before The Band was able to make a comeback and trade momentum throughout the match.  This was ultimately one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches as Scott Hall did make an appearence & ""was up to his old tricks"" which not only caused a distraction but friends the match in the end.

Abyss vs. Mr. Anderson - This was originally suppost to be Abyss vs. Bobby Lashley however due to Abyss taking out Lashley before the match, this opened the door for the TNA return (for those who remember the early NWA-TNA days) of Mr. Anderson...the former Mr. Kennedy in WWE.  While Anderson did try to work with Abyss in heavily focusing on his arm throughout the match, this was just very slow & was heavily lacking chemistry in what I thought was just a bad match...and apparently members of the Impact Zone felt the same way about Anderson's performance with them turning their back on him as they did Morley earlier.

TNA Champion A.J. Styles vs. Kurt Angle - After the classic match they delivered two weeks earlier, they would go at it one more time with the special stipulation that this was Kurt Angle's last title shot at A.J. this year.  They started out wrestling on the mat and went hold for hold with each other in the early going.  Kurt heavily worked over A.J.'s back with backbreakers including a tilt-o-whirl, body sissors, release german suplex, and even just a doubleleg charge into the corner that was so fierce that Kurt knocked out his own mouthpiece.  A.J. went aerial later on with a flip dive onto the outside & a springboard into the ring while Kurt countered with a real physical lariat that turned Styles inside out.  Both men tried to outdo each other by stealing the other's finishing moves & at one point, A.J. attempting a Styles Clash from the top rope.  Ric Flair made an appearence during the match and took a page right out of what happened almost 20 years earlier between Harley Race & Lex Luger in that Flair left with not only the TNA Champion but as the mentor to the next ""Nature Boy.""

This PPV delievered exactly what was promised by Hulk Hogan in that there were suprises & changes in the company...however, this PPV proved that not all change is good. The crowd was heavily rebellious against anything & anyone who didn't identify with the TNA they knew over the years, most of the debuts fell completely flat, too many ""CARD SUBJECT TO CHANGE"" bait & switches for my taste, and the only real standout matches were the opening & closing matches on the show.  This PPV was a huge step backwards from the PPV quality that TNA has been giving us for the past few months (why hasn't Turning Point or Final Resoultion been released yet?) & certainly wasn't the best way to begin the ""Hogan/Bischoff"" era of TNA and unless you absolutely need to have either the opening or closing match...this is one to skip.",1265673600,6,7489,4.573991031390134
