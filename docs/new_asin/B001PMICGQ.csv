8333746,5,B001PMICGQ,"This was a great view of Eggleston's passion and life. The beauty in the ordinary, simple and often ignored. I recommend this to anyone interested in the world right outside your door.",1401408000,,184,4.78125
8333747,5,B001PMICGQ,"I have always been inspired by Eggelston's work after a friend suggested I check out one of his books, 'William Eggelston's Guide.' This short but sweet film gives a brief view of the artist using his own words to describe his work/methods. It's not long enough and I'd much rather meet the man in person for tea or whisky and shoot the s*** while walking around shooting the s*** together.",1388016000,,390,4.585714285714285
8333748,1,B001PMICGQ,"Since Mr. Eggleston is living on a trust fund, he can be presumed to have money to spend on a vanity film production, which this obviously is. He is not that good as a photographer, and the film comes across more laughable than serious. He certainly is not a Henri Cartier Bresson, an Ansel Adams or a Richard Avedon. This DVD should be given away for free, not sold.

Incidentally, I have been a photographer for more than 50 years, and I know good work when I see it. Eggleston's isn't.

8333749,4,B001PMICGQ,This DVD is short but sweet. Not as absorbing as 'IN THE REAL WORLD' but anything on Bill Eggleston is worth watching.,1293494400,2,118,4.409090909090909
8333750,4,B001PMICGQ,"This is a better video overview of Eggleston and his work than ""Life in the Real World"".  The producers of ""Life..."" seemed more interested in making Eggleston and his associates and family into a reality TV program than in illuminating his art.  ""Photographer""  emphasizes the pictures and the artist at work.  It is illuminating in this regard.  The only fault of the video is the brevity.  I was left wishing for more.",1284854400,4,421,4.777777777777778
8333751,2,B001PMICGQ,"I have two of Eggleston's DVD. The other one suffers from low quality non-professional looking video. This time the video quality is better and it is good to get to know his thoughts about photography a little more. But it's too short, only 26 minutes long. I don't believe anybody can capture enough information, aspects of a photographer's work for the duration. Too short especially as a commercial product.",1248652800,6,410,4.956521739130435
