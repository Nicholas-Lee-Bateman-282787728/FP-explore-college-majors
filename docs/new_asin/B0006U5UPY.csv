8043333,3,B0006U5UPY,"As the other person who left a review this is a older movie and for some it may be to slow moving to keep their attention. However, I did enjoy the movie as it made the story of the Moravians more real and the characters I could more relate to than the stories I have previously heart of them. I would not say this is a entertaining or powerful movie, as the acting is not so much done in that manner for what many people expect from today's standards of movie production, however I felt as though I was given a glimpse of the morvavian culture and their earnest love of Christ and their desire to follow him.",1295740800,2,609,4.169491525423729
