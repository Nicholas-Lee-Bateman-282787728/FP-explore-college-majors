The speakers were good, especially Marci Shimoff, but the dancers were too much and made me uncomfortable watching them.  I was very disappointed and returned the movie.",1270598400,,265,4.595744680851064
8311652,4,B001J00S3O,"I bought this DVD because Byron Katie appears in it.  I've watched it several times and each time I get something new out of it.  Getting to know the spiritual teachers showcased in the film has been very fullfilling.  The only draw back is the quick cuts from scene to scene.  It happens throughout and I find myself waiting for the ""real"" show to begin.  I wish they would have let the speakers talk longer and put in fewer of the ""cut to scenes"".  Seeing the same images over and over bores me rather than inspires me.  Still worth the money though, because the information is great no matter how presented.",1259366400,,610,4.441441441441442
8311653,5,B001J00S3O,"Quest: Happy, Wealthy & Wise is an outstanding program featuring inspirational leaders telling us their secrets for personal and collective success. The stories are engaging and the messages very powerful. The Quest series is a toolkit for our own personal transformation. Highly recommended!",1227744000,2,292,5.813953488372093
