8557859,3,B00AU6LZU8,It was funny. The picture quality was a little grainy.,1478736000,,54,4.5
8557860,5,B00AU6LZU8,I loved this show as a kid and it was very fun to see it again.  There are two half hour episodes in one.  It's not a movie but two TV episodes.,1431302400,,144,3.46875
8557861,4,B00AU6LZU8,"A silly 1960s sitcom which is a satire of westerns.  Along the lines of other shows like F-Troop.  Provides good humor and gags.  And with Ann Sheridan in the lead, it is even more special.",1403740800,,189,4.3428571428571425
8557862,3,B00AU6LZU8,Would love to see this but it has no sound. Streaming has problems with no sound. This is rare an episode from the little seen TV series with the very talented Ann Sheridan at the end of her too short life and the always hilarious  and Ruth McDevitt.,1373155200,2,250,4.208333333333333
8557863,5,B00AU6LZU8,"When I was a kid (age 8-9 or so) Pistols & Petticoats was one of my favorite tv shows! I loved Ann Sheridan. But let's face it, even she couldn't compare to Gunsmoke & Miss Kitty. So I'll have to say that P&P is #2. But does anyone I know wonder why I'm a redhead now?",1371945600,,268,3.8035714285714284
8557864,2,B00AU6LZU8,"There are considerable reproduction quality issues with this DVD release of what was a very cute television series and is now apparently in the public domain.  The quality of the original film to DVD master transfer was so poor that I returned the DVD and I would not recommend a purchase for the offering price.  It might be a better choice to use Amazon Instant Video to view this program.  I ordered the DVD because I am a fan of the late Ann Sheridan and wanted to view some of her last work in television.
There is nothing wrong with this cute episode as far as the content goes, but the DVD quality is lamentable. First, the DVD gives  us only one random episode of the television series, promoting it under the Cinema Classics title, as though it were a ""feature"" and having a running time printed on the disc of 90 minutes.  One would assume feature-length; its not.  This is only an average hour length TV show.  The titles of the show indicate that it was filmed in Technicolor.  This is only a shaky transfer to video from some collector's 16mm film print in black and white.  The video transfer technician scanned the 4:3 original television format by cropping it into a pseudo wide screen format and the resulting enlarged image tends to make the entire show soft on focus to the point of ruining it.  The quality that you might expect would be a modern quality image, but with a fuzzy transfer from film you see the show with poorer resolution than would have been a standard definition image on a 1960's era broadcast television screen.
On the positive side, the packaging of the DVD is attractive. But trust me, this isn't one you would want to be viewing over and over again.  Wait until an enterprising company releases a half-dozen or more episodes of the show in a set.  Why Desert Island Films put so much effort into packaging, rather than the content quality of their release, is hard to understand.",1366761600,9,1922,4.555232558139535
