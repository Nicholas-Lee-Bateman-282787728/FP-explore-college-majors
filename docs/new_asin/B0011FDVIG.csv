ROAD TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP

I wish the IFL would put out more DVD's, the two that we got are great but I need some more. Any way this DVD is a great DVD for any MMA fan, it is a must own in my opinion. Don't let people fool you this is the complete finals episode of season, that's right every fight on the card.. You will also get two bonus fights including a super fight, and the classic fight of 2007 between Chris Horodecki and Shad Lierley. You will also get three great featurettes that review the entire season and the semi finals for both teams. There is also a behind the scenes look at the Pitbulls, outtakes, and the ever popular Rory Markham uncut feature. Renzo Gracie's Pitbulls vs. Pat Miletich's Silverbacks.

1. JAKE ELLENBERGER [SILVERBACKS] VS DELSON HELENO [PITBULLS]-the first fight of the night saw these two lock into the clinch for most of the first round. Round two was great with both fighters trying to get the win, Jake even looked like he was going to take the round. But Delson locks in a sick arm bar and wins with 15 seconds left on the clock. 4.5/5

2. BART PALASZEWSKI [SILVERBACKS] VS DEIVIDAS TAUROSEVICIUS [PITBULLS]-great first round in this fight, both are not afraid to swing and throw some high kicks. There is even a nice take down and some ground and pound. The second round looks like the first round of this fight but ends like the second round of the first fight, with Renzo Gracie's Pitbulls winning by arm bar again. 5/5

3. BEN ROTHWELL [SILVERBACKS] VS RICCO RODRIGUEZ [PITBULLS]-that's right the UFC veteran Ricco is on this card and is going up against one of the IFL's most popular fighters. A good first round between the two takes place as both throw some good punches, Ricco even sinks in a good Guillotine choke. The second round looks just like the first but Ricco is obviously tired leaving this round. The third looks exactly like the first two rounds punches and guillotine included, but Ricco is far more tired then he should have been. Ben wins the fight by judge's decision. 4/5

4. RYAN MCGIVERN [SILVERBACKS] VS FABIO LEOPOLDO [PITBULLS]-another good first round between these two teams, both come out to fight swinging and throwing kicks. There is even a nice knock down, and some good take down defense seen in the first round. The second round is just as good with Ryan dominating the round and eventually knocking Fabio out. 5/5

5. MIKE CIESNOLEVICZ [SILVERBACKS] VS ANDRE GUSMAO [PITBULLS]-the final fight of the night ends quick and in impressive fashion. After a nice feeling out process both start putting in work, and Andre lands a beautiful knee that knocks out Mike early in the first round. And just like that the underdog Pitbulls win the championship for the 2007 season. I like the celebration in the ring after the fight, and Renzo shows why he is one of the classiest and funniest guys in the business. 5/5

SUPERFIGHT
DANIEL GRACIE VS WES SIMS-the super fight would see one of the world famous Gracie fighters going up against a legend in the business in Wes Sims. These two had fought before and came to a draw, so this would give them the chance to end things. I also like the fact that UFC legend Jens Pulver is on the commentary. The fight opens with Sims trying to manhandle Gracie, which ends with Gracie getting the trip and eventually getting his back. The fight ends with Sims getting choked out by Daniel Gracie with a rear naked choke. 5/5

FIGHT OF THE YEAR
SHAD LIERLEY VS CHRIS HORODECKI-a great opening round between these two warriors. Both of them just throw down with each other, kicks and punches galore. Both do an excellent job in the first with no clear winner. The second round is just like the first, total none stop action. The third and final round was just as impressive, both of which fight to the very end with everything they got. Chris ends up getting the judges decision and you could argue who won either way, a great fight. 5/5

This is with out a doubt a must own DVD, I don't understand why you wouldn't want this.",1220486400,2,4037,4.549586776859504
8241648,3,B0011FDVIG,"The dvd itself was ok, consisting of highlights of the IFL 2007 Semi-Finals, and the majority of the Finals card. The only reason I purchased this dvd was the superfight of Lindland vs Newton, which isn't even on the dvd! The description listed ""superfights"", meaning more than one. The only Superfight was Daniel Gracie vs Wes Sims. Had the description been a little more accurate, I probably wouldn't have bought it, but it's still a decent piece for your MMA collection.",1209168000,,473,4.851851851851852
