7309077,5,B010CVUXY4,another great find via recommendation.  enjoyed a lot.,1448841600,,54,5.75
7309078,3,B010CVUXY4,"I picked this up without having seen it first, as I tend to do now with anime blurays being pretty affordable these days.  I had read reviews that described it as a horror/comedy.  I'm not entirely sure how people could put this in the horror category.  I would consider it an action/drama/comedy.  The story is pretty engaging and the characters are fun company.  The English voice acting is great, although I wasn't a huge fan of the male lead's voice.  His character had lines that should have been funny but just weren't delivered very well.  The animation is absolutely fantastic, especially during the fight scenes.  The story arc manages to wrap up pretty nicely whereas most 12-episode animes suffer from attempting to tie up all loose ends during the final episode.

Overall, it was an enjoyable series with incredible animation.",1448236800,2,838,4.928571428571429
7309079,5,B010CVUXY4,Fabulous series!,1448064000,,16,7.5
7309080,5,B010CVUXY4,"With this anime I did something I swore I would never do. And that is buy a bluray of a show I've never seen or heard of. But I was pleasantly surprised. The story was solid and well executed, the animation was fluid and beautiful, and the voice acting for both Japanese and English were really good. I was skeptical when I saw it was only 12 episodes long. With a show that short you're kind of rolling the dice. Some of the best shows I've seen have been about that length, as well as the worst ones I've ever seen. This one is a winner though. I felt connected to the characters by the end, and wanted them to succeed. I laughed with them and even cried with them. I just can't get enough of this one.",1446681600,15,704,4.108695652173913
7309081,5,B010CVUXY4,Another Excellent DVD.  Prompt service.,1445990400,,39,6.8
7309082,5,B010CVUXY4,"The juxtaposition of comedy and horror is not especially unusual, but I've rarely seen such absolutely lunatic comedy contrasted with such gruesome horror, which makes for some pretty wide swings in overall episode mood.  If you haven't seen it before, you never know whether in a given episode you are going to see our heroes tangling with monsters that can merely make them smell bad or monsters that can rip their bodies or their minds to shreds.  Thus IMHO the comedy serves a useful purpose: it allows us to get to know (and get to like) the characters under less stressful than life or death situations and it lightens the mood because without it this would be a pretty depressing ordeal.

At its most basic Beyond the Boundary is Yet Another story about young monster slayers.  The monsters are Youmu, invisible-to-ordinary-humans spirit creatures, said to be the product of negative human emotions.  As a result, most (though by no means all) youmu are harmful, ranging from annoying pranksters through vicious killers to world consuming horrors, and the only thing standing between them and us are a relative handful of young men and women with the spiritual affinity necessary to see youmu and the supernatural abilities (and the willingness to use them) necessary to destroy them.  Finally, when a youmu is killed, it drops a Youmu Stone, which can be exchanged for money at a sanctioned appraiser who pays out according to things like aggressiveness, degree of difficulty, etc.  This is strangely similar to how the economy works in the light novel/manga/anime series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Is-It-Wrong-to-Try-to-Pick-Up-Girls-in-a-Dungeon/dp/0316339156/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon</a>, but with two important differences.  In IIWTTTPUGIAD adventurers slay monsters for fame, fortune,... and girls (Don't ask!), but in BTB the only practical goal is money.  After all there isn't much fame to be had for slaying monsters most people cannot even see and which you are not even allowed to talk about with normies, and spirit world warriors tend to have it pretty awful in the romance department.  For example Shizuku Ninomiya, a rather attractive and personable (if slightly silly) spirit world warrior working as a teacher at the high school most of the characters attend gets dumped so often it has become a joke to her spirit world oblivious students.  Izumi Nase, effective head of the Nase clan of spirit world warriors goes so far as to counsel her younger sister, Mitsuki, to stay alone until she retires, something Izumi seems to be practicing herself, which has resulted in Mitsuki missing out on most normal childhood experiences with her ""normal"" peers.  In light of this, spirit world warrior Yayoi Kanbara producing a child with a youmu father doesn't seem all that inconceivable, in any sense of the word.

Into this grim situation come our two main protagonists: Akihito Kanbara, the half human, half youmu product of said union and Mirai Kuriyama, the last living member of a cursed and nearly exterminated clan of spirit world warriors that use their own blood as a lethal weapon, and amazingly, joyously, they manage to hit it off, though naturally they are the last to know it.  Despite his fetish for glasses, her overuse of the phrase that translates to ""how unpleasant"", and an entire box full of screwball comedy romantic complications, not to mention all this spirit world business, they gradually, oh, so gradually fall in love, but is happiness even possible for them in this world where the greatest evil comes not from rampaging youmu but rather from the horrifyingly corrupt human mind and heart?

Let's just say it comes to a satisfying ending IMHO,...

or rather it SEEMS to....

I've got to give the creators credit, they made a sincere effort to give those viewers who would rather stop here a seemingly happy ending, but the story isn't really happily ended, not by a long shot.  I'll give you one word:

amnesia.

Yes, it's the most overused trick in an author's toolbox, but it is used with great care and skill here.  If someone had lived a life filled with misery and regret, wouldn't said person be happier if it were now possible to live without all those sad memories?  Even if it meant you had to give up associating?  Even if you had been in love?  More importantly, do you have the right to make that decision for someone else?  All these questions are considered in a story that also ties up some loose ends from the TV show you might have forgotten about in the rush of the cataclysmic climax.  This is the plot of ""Beyond the Boundary: The Future"", the second of two movies produced after the series ended, the first ""Beyond the Boundary: The Past"", being a compilation film, and though watching the compilation is optional, watching the second really isn't if you would have a true happy ending.  Unfortunately, it is only available online at present, but hopefully Sentai Filmworks will eventually release it as well.  Interestingly, to a much greater extent than the TV series, it drives home a moral that works for spirit world warriors and normies alike: don't go it alone.  A burden shared is a burden eased whether you are talking about couples, families, or friends.  In a time when the increasing tendency is to get completely wrapped up in our own worlds with our own problems, that's good and perhaps even necessary advice.

Note: All versions of this TV series complete collection include a prequel OAV Episode 0 that shows what happened when Akihito and the Nase family first met and 5 episodes of ""Beyond the Boundary Trial Idol!"" which amount to a self-parody.  I would recommend NOT watching Episode 0 first, before the 12 regular episodes your first time through because it gives away a few things that are best picked up as the series reveals them, and then watching the 5 idol trial episodes afterwards because otherwise they will make no sense.  Finally, track down and watch ""Beyond the Boundary: The Future"".

Note: When it comes to subtitles versus voice dubbing, I'm no purist; I'm willing to accept either though all things being equal I prefer dubbing to subbing so that I can watch what's showing on the rest of the screen easier.  However, all is not equal in this set.  For reasons I could only speculate upon, the subtitling is better, providing information the dubbing does not.  So if you would understand as much as possible about what is going on watch the subtitled version at least once, and pay attention.

7309083,5,B010CVUXY4,"I absolutely loved this anime.  It is about two cursed individuals who find each other and support one another when noone else would.  This is about love, betrayal, magic, demons, and comedy!
By far one of my favorite animes of all time.  So good that I even bought the blue ray to support it. (First time ever)
If you want another run of the mill animes where you can literally guess whats going to happen next then this is not for you
If you want an anime that will touch upon every aspect that a great anime should with fight scenes that would rival that of the best animes around.  Give it a shot, I promise you will not be disappointed.

Btw, I paid full price for this anime.  And that is after already watching the free fansubs in 1080p.  It was just worth it to actually own it.",1445558400,11,786,4.23489932885906
7309084,4,B010CVUXY4,"Akihito Kanbara is a second year high school student, a member of the literature club, and an immortal half yomu. The last one is good, because when he meets first year Mirai Kuriyama, she shoves a sword made from her blood through his chest. Mirai is from a long line of yomu hunters and her clan has long been shunned due to their strange blood manipulation abilities. For some reason, she seems it have it out for Akihito and keeps trying to kill him while he tries to befriend her.

Talk about a rough introduction. Despite not being able to die, Akihito still feels pain. And because he is indestructible, he doesnt seem to have bothered to learn any sort of basic defense, while Mirai is a trained warrior. So he gets stabbed a lot. Eventually they call a ceasefire (she agrees to stop stabbing him), which was a relief. It was kind of hard to accept his interest in her when she kept making him bleed.

I kind of expected to hate Mirai, since she is the sort of character that normally annoyed me, but I actually liked her. Unlike so many cutesy characters, she actually seemed cute. She also turns out not to be as dumb and annoying as you might assume from her initial treatment of the main character.

Both Akihito and Mirai had rough pasts. Through their friendship they start to heal and move forward. Then the ending comes and shatters everything. Surprising information is revealed and something equaling surprising occurs. There is a little bit of weirdness in the last episode, but overall the ending actually made me like the series more (good endings really make a difference).

Beyond the Boundary is an entertaining show. At only 12 episodes, it is the perfect length to tell the story it starts out to tell.",1440028800,2,1728,4.60064935064935
7309085,4,B010CVUXY4,"This series was a blast! But you have to pace yourself with it, if you watch it all marathon like it may feel.. rushed. Not to say 'rushed' as in unpolished because its beautiful and high quality but they try to mash up way too many story arcs into just a few episodes.",1485043200,,269,4.09433962264151
7309086,5,B010CVUXY4,I would arguably say this has to be one of the best titles Sentai Entertainment is currently distributing. The artwork is good and the story has good pace. Well worth picking up,1476576000,,177,4.5625

7309094,5,B010CVUXY4,"I did really like the plot.  The main female lead does take on the persona of the common stereotype, so it was almost a turn off, and there are a few other stereotypical elements that are a bit of a let down; however, this is a Japanese anime, so given where its coming from, it had a decent delivery of her being far more dynamic than the exterior model you initially see.  Without giving away too much, the lead female character does end up showing quite a lot more backbone than initially implied.

Further, it concludes well while tying everything back up into a nice scenario.  All-too-often, I watch series like this one, and they don't end up ending things by resolving all of the conflict.  Overall, it had great dynamics between the characters (again for a JAnime), and although not my favorite anime, this one was surprisingly good despite a few rough spots in characters' first impressions.",1457049600,4,901,4.677215189873418

8722106,5,B010CVUXY4,"Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. We sat down and watched it together. I will admit, I actually enjoyed this anime. It was funny, cheesy and even confusing at times (which meant it had a deeper backstory that I actually had to focus on and think about). You don't even learn why it is called Beyond the Boundary until the last few episodes. For a short anime series (12 episodes I think?) I would recommend this. It contains all of your expected Japanese/Anime tropes; the overuse of the term Senpai, a character that is attracted to his sister, an otaku, a bitchy pretty bad ass, and really obscure characters that support the story narrative.",1515369600,,655,4.7043478260869565

8722108,3,B010CVUXY4,"The score itself isn't reflective of the anime itself but rather what is (or in this case isn't) in the package.

Let start of with the anime. The anime is fantastic with a great Japanese voice cast (have not listened to the show with the English dub), fantastic animation by the renown Kyoto Animation, and a beautiful story to top it all off.

What drags down this supposed ""Complete Collection"" is the complete absence of the OVA episode that is included ONLY with the Premium Set that includes a bunch of tiny extras and a hefty price tag for the small additions added to that set. This is disappointing, as in the past Sentai regularly included OVAs in all their ""Complete Collections"", regardless if it was a special edition or not.

The complete absence of the OVA and any extras really devalues the blu-ray. And that is heartbreaking to say about a blu-ray to one of my favorite anime in the last five years.",1493078400,10,916,4.573170731707317
