5958495,5,B00EZBCA9Y,"At the time of its release (1954), Dawn at Socorro was reviewed by the New York Times.  The reviewer struck a condescending tone, suggesting that it is a movie for people who don't want surprises in their film fare.  Maybe critics of the time could afford to be smug about popular entertainment such as this film.  But now, 60 years later, movies like Dawn at Socorro deserve to be treasured, rather than dismissed, because Hollywood has long since forgotten how to make films like this.  Rory Calhoun makes a terrific hero; world-weary, introspective, and resigned to his fate.  He has nothing left to prove, just some hard-won sage advice to offer those willing to listen.  Piper Laurie is the appealing, conflicted female lead.  Incidentally, if I had to guess, Id say that Universal International was attempting to repeat the success theyd had the previous year with the Tyrone Power film, Mississippi Gambler (which also featured Piper Laurie.)  If you enjoyed that film, chances are, youll also enjoy this one.  The Technicolor Dawn at Socorro is appealing to look at, and has some impressively mounted shots, such as the scene late in the film when Calhoun stands waiting for a train.  I had the impression that care was invested in the making of this film by pros who really knew their jobs, and the final shoot-out is very satisfying.  Its an intelligent (if uncomplicated) Western, and certainly not a B Western tailored for children.  It achieves its goal of providing audiences with good, solid, straightforward entertainment.  Predictable?  Well, in my opinion, whatever shortcomings Dawn at Socorro may have are incidental to its value as one of the finite number of a particular type of popular entertainment of the 1950s that has been left for us to continue to enjoy in todays sadly more cynical age.",1392076800,10,1817,4.934210526315789
5958496,5,B00EZBCA9Y,"I first saw this movie over 50 years ago, and even then I recognized what it was, a retelling of the Gunfight at the OK Corral, but this time from the point of view of Doc Holliday.  Rory Calhoun plays Brett Wade a notorious gambler with a bad cough and a habit of backing up a friend, a law man Harry McNair, played by James Millican who spent many years playing Wyatt Earp in other movies from Universal International.  And like the westerns that we all remember so well, the color is fantastic, vivid and clear.  With David Brian in his usual role of the conniving gambling hall owner who hires his killing done, this time by Alex Nicole the stage is set for a great story as Calhoun and Brian war over a card table for the fate of Piper Laurie.  With a supporting cast including Edgar Buchanan, and Lee Van Cleef you have the makings of the movie that High Noon never did quite make.",1383177600,12,887,4.293413173652695
8610780,4,B00EZBCA9Y,"This western begins with a copy of the gunfight at the OK Corral. Rory Calhoun, like Doc Holiday, is a gambler who is an expert shot, drinks too much, and is fast on the draw. He wants to help the sheriff and the sheriff's brother in a gunfight at a corral against a bad father and his two sons. Rory like Holiday suffers from a cough, but his is from an old gun wound that he did not allow to heal well, not TB as Holiday. The father and one son are killed, and the sheriff's brother is wounded in the leg. One of the brothers, played by Van Cleff, escapes being killed. He swears vengeance against Rory, and there is a gunfight between the two later. Although, Van Cleff's part is relatively small, he stands out, and one can see by the way he acts that it is no surprise that he later becomes a leading man in many westerns.
In this film, the father who was killed helped a gunfighter who would have wanted to be at the corral, but he was drunk. He swears revenge against Rory. Another difference is the part played by Piper Laure. Piper was disowned by her father who mistakenly thinks she had sex with his ranch hands. Rory falls in love with her and does his best to save her from working with a saloon owner.",1477526400,,1215,4.196581196581197

8610784,5,B00EZBCA9Y,This is an beautiful color transfer of Dawn at Socorro. The film is excellent and different from most other Universal International westerns in that it relies on characterization rather than action. Rory Calhoun and Piper Laurie both give terrific performances as does the supporting cast. It is a winner in every respect.,1427241600,2,322,5.211538461538462

8610789,5,B00EZBCA9Y,One of a golden age group of westerns from the 1950's. The transfer is good without any remastering. Rory and Edgar Buchanan headline a good cast in this pseudo remake of 'Gunfight At The OK Corral.,1396396800,2,198,4.527777777777778
