7864639,5,6304212399,"A sweetly claustrophobic tale of the tempestuous and almost incestuous whirl that lies beneath the genteel and respectable surface of civilised Society in the South west of England. Harnessing Peacocks is great fun, and is a well acted, well presented, rather saucy drawing room comedy, that also manages to expose the hypocrisy of 'the right sort of people'. Vivacious, and fun, and with just a small dollop of romance.",1464220800,,420,5.101449275362318
7864640,5,6304212399,"Highly recommended. Lovely story; amazing central character/actress (Serena Scott Thomas) backed up by a great supporting cast, in an unusual and well-written story. Directed by the great James Cellan Jones. It won the prestigious Golden Nymph award for Best Television Film at the Monte-Carlo Television Festival.",1463270400,,314,5.8478260869565215

7864643,5,6304212399,"Saw this on TV about 20 years ago and really liked it and always remembered it. Just happened to search for it and discovered it available on VHS. I think it came from a reseller, but the tape's in great shape, just as advertised. I've enjoyed seeing it again very much!",1367452800,,270,4.313725490196078
7864644,5,6304212399,"I saw this film years ago on our PBS channel and could never find it on AMAZON. In fact I stopped trying for a couple of years. At last, I am ordering it. I wish it would come out on DVD. It's one of the sweetest romances as well as very funny comedies I've seen in many years. I absolutely love it. I highly recommend it for romantics, single moms, lovers of British films etc. Very good entertainment.",1268438400,7,403,4.17948717948718
