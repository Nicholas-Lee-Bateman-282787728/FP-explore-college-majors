8273238,3,B0019BI1AK,"I bought this film because I am a fan of DMX. He has a small but crucial role in this film. He is deadly and quotes scriptures before he kills his enemies. Kristofferson is good and Baraka is good as usual. Kane and Abel are okay as two hit men. Their rap songs on the soundtrack aren't that good. This is an okay action film. There are plenty of shootouts, an explosion, a car flips over someone, gets blown up, another man gets hung, another gets burned up and then he gets blown up. So there are some interesting touches of violence. X is definitely off the hook in this film. He interacts with the cast and he speaks his lines well. I wanted to see more of him but I liked the fact that his character was unstoppable. If you are a fan of X you must buy this film. The only weak spot is the fake scenes filmed inside speeding cars. They are obviously fake. Recommended for fans of urban dramas.",1466726400,,897,4.190751445086705

8273242,1,B0019BI1AK,"I really like Kris Kristofferson but he was old, fat and slow and all the actoring was bad.  The lines sounded trite and sounded as if they were being read. It hurts me not to give Kris 5 stars but as policemen they were so over the top it seemed like a high school play.  The black cop who also is normally great shot and killed everyone he met with no punity. The dark photography helped the movie since it hid the poor photography. SORRY",1234742400,,440,4.1647058823529415
8273243,1,B0019BI1AK,"You'd think by reading what this movie is about that you're getting an action packed movie. But you aren't!!! The acting is awful, the quality of the recording is badly done and the way they directed the film leaves you wondering ""Wait, did I miss something""!!!!???? How???? What???
Anyway you get the point.=)",1221955200,2,310,4.867924528301887
