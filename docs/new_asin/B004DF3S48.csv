8425288,3,B004DF3S48,It is a good sequence but there is not a work to burn fat. It has balance and it is well explain,1397001600,,96,3.409090909090909
8425289,5,B004DF3S48,"This is another one of her videos that i just love because you really get a great workout. It's fairly slow and you can concentrate on your breathing and holding the belly in...:P She has some great stretches for the shoulders in there. It's also broken up in chapters, so if you just want the sitting poses or  whatever, you don't have to do the whole thing. The bonus belly buster is cool too...not so difficult but definitely see the results!!!",1305590400,3,447,4.518518518518518
8425290,5,B004DF3S48,I really enjoy this DVD.  It is not a difficult workout (no sweating) but I feel like I get a good stretch and my body feels renewed and relaxed at the end.  The full body section of the DVD is around 45 minutes followed by a separate ab section about 10-15 minutes long.  The poses are not hard and Stacy is an easy to follow instuctor.  Definately a good DVD to have in any collection.,1304294400,3,387,4.12
8425291,5,B004DF3S48,I love this DVD workout.  Stacy is clear in her instructions and easily followed without having to have your eyes on the tv the entire time.  I would definitely buy more of her DVDs.,1288915200,,182,4.323529411764706
