8636173,4,B00HV07FAK,"I thought this was a pretty good shoot interview. AJ spends a lot of time talking about video games. But the shoot interview is filled with plenty of good stuff. AJ seems content with how his life is going. He isn't bitter or holding a grudge against TNA for not trying harder to keep him in the fold in TNA. AJ is TNA period. They should have kept him. But I think now it looks like TNA might be going out of business or might be going through a big reboot. Sting has gone to WWE. Angle is probably going back to WWE when his contract expires.

  Talking to AJ about his time in TNA made me both happy and sad. TNA screwed a lot of things up and missed some opportunities. They made mistakes but TNA came from nothing to something. It was a weekly pay per view that really had to overcome a lot to make it. They could have gone out of business long ago but they kept in business and even though they could never take the next big step to another level they gave themselves chances to get better and they survived. One of the parts that was funny when AJ mentioned he didn't understand Mick Foley's role in TNA. He didn't know if he was a commissioner or a wrestler. I thought Foley helped TNA in his early run there. He had a great match with Kevin Nash at Hardcore Justice. AJ talked about Booker T seeing TNA as the minor leagues. Booker T helped AJ become a better wrestler but he didn't look to be having as much fun as he could be. AJ thought Booker T could be a jerk sometimes.

  AJ talked about how Hogan didn't turn TNA to gold. Hogan never mentioned TNA on tv shows or radio shows he appeared on. I think AJ believed Hogan could have brought more to TNA. I don't think Hogan was a booker. I think like AJ said the people in the Impact Zone went crazy when Hogan was there but there was no longer an audience for The Hulkster. Not enough people were watching. I give TNA massive credit for trying to get bigger but it was better they just use their home breed stars like Joe, Styles and Daniels as the faces of the company. You can have one Sting here and there but you don't need a roster stocked up of old veterans interested in pay checks and not having many years left in them.

  AJ points out a major problem with TNA is when Jarrett left it was a red flag that things were going real bad. Jarrett put his blood, sweat and tears into TNA. For him to just walk away shows theres a lot that needs to be fixed in TNA. Jarrett as the founder seems to be a person who relishes the challenge and for him to quit most of meant there was something seriously up with TNA that was not good. AJ also came across as a person who had no problem letting guys like RVD and Cage take his spot from time to time. I think with RVD AJ thought their program should have gone differently. I think Cage was perfect for TNA. I thought RVD didn't make the biggest impact but he helped TNA.

  In the end this is a very great shoot interview. It made me pop in my Best of AJ Styles Volume 2 TNA DVD to relieve the glory years of TNA. Who knows maybe AJ will surface in Jarrett's new company or making a shocking return to TNA. One thing for sure TNA will never be the same without Styles. He did have a great run there though.

This 2 hour-15 minute interview was taped on January 2nd 2014 and fantastically was released on dvd not very long after (Got my copy on January 27th). AJ Styles seems like a guy that doesn't hold grudges and doesn't have a chip on his shoulder but at the same time knows when something sucks and he rips into TNA. How he felt the new contract he was given felt like a slap in the face How some of the wrestlers were there simply for a paycheck, how Hogan coming to TNA turned out to be a terrible thing. Plus, so may other topics in TNA.

Plus as a bonus disc we get a special shoot interview from February 2006 that comes with a couple matches.

A great dvd and it's good to get the REAL story straight from the Phenomenal One himself.",1390953600,,775,4.194630872483222
