2691184,1,B000KGGZXK,I just want to stop any Brad Harris fans from potentially wasting their money on this dreadful dvd. The picture quality on all of the films is awful. Stick with your bootleg videos or foreign language copies. And as for that cover...,1186185600,22,233,4.571428571428571
2691185,2,B000KGGZXK,"Seeing these film in this condition, I wondered which film could survive this treatment and still be considered ""good"" in some way.
These films are better than they are shown here. It could be, however, that the best of them is still the one which is not in ths collection, which was called ""drei grne Hunde"" in Germany and which I saw at the Cinema Paradiso in Lugano when I was fifteen and totally loved. Cinema Paradiso in Lugano in the late sixties was however something very special - it cannot get more romantic than that - and maybe all films I saw there gave a better impression than they deserved.",1185667200,9,606,4.468468468468468

8156791,2,B000KGGZXK,"The picture and sound quality has not been enhanced to meet today's standards, as has been done with other vintage film offerings from the same era. This, along with the cheezy story lines (once considered cool), make this package cumbersome to watch. I highly recommend these to anyone in need of a remedy for insomnia.",1411084800,,320,4.836363636363636
8156792,4,B000KGGZXK,"Fun collection of tongue-in-cheek Euro spy flicks made in the mid-1960's starring Tony Kendall and Brad Harris.  The proceedings are not to be taken seriously, like any of these types of films including the Bond movies.  The two spies are Kendall who is the ladies man, and Harris as the serious one (who I think is better looking than Kendall).  The quality of these films on this DVD release fluctuates from pretty good to so-so but they are certainly viewable.  It would be nice to see pristine re-mastered versions released to DVD, but in the meantime this release is perfectly adequate.  Recommended for fans of this genre.",1397865600,2,628,4.831775700934579
8156793,4,B000KGGZXK,"OK. The quality isn't HD. Neither is the audio. But given that this was a movie shot in the 60s, the quality on this DVD is the same Eastman Color standard as it was when shown back then. Even before Enter the Dragon rocked the martial arts movie genre, Death is Nimble, Death is Quick had caught the audiences around the world with its epic finale between Brad Harris and Dan Vadis.
And the delivery was way quicker than expected!",1393718400,2,431,4.4
8156794,3,B000KGGZXK,"Some fun, if light, action and adventure may be found here, but I think Connery's Bond and even Mike Henry's Tarzan are significantly better.

The picture on the face of the DVD package has nothing to do with the contents of the 3 detective/spy/adventure films on the disc. The video quality was not great, but if you are a fan of the era you won't find it too distracting. It looked like good quality for old TV. For audio, the voices seemed out of synch with the visuals. That was more distracting, but I was just going along for the old-school Euro-adventure story, and my expectations for language and production values were not great anyway.

Kendall and Harris make an athletic team with some believable action. Harris largely plays second fiddle, but he's cool to watch.

The films are silly if you allow yourself to think at all while viewing. I doubt these films would keep the attention of young fans of contemporary movies, as everything today is much larger, faster and fantastic now with all the effects.

I wasn't even born when the first 2 of these movies came out and I am accustomed to a different standard in this genre, but I get a kick out of the style, adventure and simplicity of these films, so this DVD manages a score of 3 stars from me.",1384128000,,1262,4.521929824561403

8156796,5,B000KGGZXK,"Very very rare to find, for what I know only few copies around the world ...this is the first martial art movie ever....it introduced and inspired all the following others of the 70s until today.....",1326326400,5,199,4.714285714285714
8156797,5,B000KGGZXK,"What a delight this was...a wonderfully nostalgic trip back to the way movies were when I was a little boy.

All three films are surprisingly well done and feature the good hair, clothes, cars & music of the period.  Tony Kendall makes an especially attractive hero, making his leading ladies ardent attitudes far more plausible than when we see these romantic plot devices on ""I Spy,"" ""Star Trek,"" etc.  Brad Harris is great as the two-fisted best friend and their easy alliance fighting crime is tongue-in-cheek fun.

Much has been written about the quality of the DVDs.  I was prepared for the worst and pleasantly surprised.  These are clean (no dust, no scratches) 16mm TV prints taken from 35mm UltraScope masters.  If you lived in the 1960s and 1970s as I did, you'll recall that ALL TV USED TO LOOK LIKE THIS.  Yes, even prime-time ""movie of the week"" specials.  FYI, ""UltraScope"" was an extreme version of CinemaScope, the anamorphic process which squeezed a very wide image onto standard film.  It was then expanded by the projector in theaters to create a super-wide panoramic image.  On 4:3 TV however, it means you're only seeing a portion of the 35mm negative; a 16mm print of this means added grain.  So what?  The color and picture are still fine--just not HD.

Great collection, great fun.  Enjoy!",1312761600,12,1314,4.803571428571429

8156799,4,B000KGGZXK,"Retromedia has released 3 of the popular Kommissar X films based on the novel by Bert F. Island.  The first two are directed by Frank Kramer (Gianfranco Parolini) who also directed the Sabata trilogy of Spaghetti Westerns in the late sixties. The films involve two characters :Joe Walker played with playboy arrogance by Tony Kendall and Tom Rowland played by Euro stalwart Brad Harris who also choreographed the action scenes in two of the films. All of them have the Bondian mix of beautiful women, outlandish set pieces and megalomaniac villains.  My favorite of the bunch is 'SO DARLING SO DEADLY', a tight,fast moving piece of sixties escapism which doesn't let you catch a breather from beginning to end.  It has all the usual ingredients and like another spy film of the same year 'A TARGET FOR KILLING'  it has not one but a half dozen lethal ladies brandishing machine guns and leather whips to torture their captives.  The third film 'DEATH IS NIMBLE' also stars another euro star Dan Vadis who is a master of killer karate moves and the face off between Vadis and Harris at the climax is alone worth the price of the disc.  All three are full screen versons but 'DEATH IS NIMBLE' has the worst wear with some faded color spots and missing frames at reel changes.  But then again, where are you going to view these films unless you have inferior bootleg copies over the years.  All in all, a nice package for Spy fans until the definitive releases come along.",1279929600,3,1469,4.666666666666667
