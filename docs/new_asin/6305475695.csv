1036250,5,6305475695,Great movie,1487635200,,11,5.0
1036251,1,6305475695,"This is a conditional 1 star. The movie is terrible, to put it bluntly. It's the MST3k brand of terrible though, in that watching it with friends and throwing popcorn at the screen makes this movie great, in a way. Marvel as Roberts takes takes a dump on the already mediocre story of the games stolen hand over fist from the Man-Kzin Wars. Giggle like an idiot as he tries to re-shoot the movie Das Boot in space, complete with one of Das Boot's actors telling people on a space ship to be quiet so the Kilrathi can't detect them. Watch your science nerd friends try to figure out why a space carrier needs a landing deck or how they clear it by pushing it with a bulldozer until the space fighter falls off the side of the ship. Watch Roberts shoehorn himself into a position to save the main characters in a way that rivals Shyamalan in Lady in the Water.

Tl;dr - The movie is the right kind of godawful to watch with friends and/or drinking games with friends. It's dangerous to go alone, take booze.",1486771200,,1005,4.345744680851064

A nice way to occupy my eyes while slowing down at the end of a tiring day when I didn't want to think any more. :-)  Weightlessness seems relative, sometimes there's a force field and sometimes there's just a (leaky) door in the same opening,  starships fight like 17th century ships of the line, and space fighters (especially the Kilrathi) seem to alternate between being unstoppably deadly and totally inept.

1036579,4,6305475695,"I like this movie even though I have played some of the game.  I grew up on the old WW II movies like run silent, run deep, the enemy below, etc.  . This movie plays out similarly to the old war movies.  You still have character development, you have the action, and slow pace of the anticipation of battle, and overall it's a great flashback experience to the old films.  Too many movies these days throw the film plot, et al. in your face early on and try to keep the pace hectic and action packed.  Sure, that's fine if you're in the mood for that kind of thing.  It's a perfect blend of old style war, and new style war.  Wish they made more movies like this in science fiction.",1462406400,,682,4.1603053435114505

It does have some flaws, (silly alien bad guys, ships that roar in space), but on the whole a decent, not too complicated spaceship adventure.  I also liked this much, much more than Phantom Menace.",1462147200,,356,4.430769230769231
1036583,2,6305475695,"Weak acting, poor special effects, and horrible props.  It almost could be classified as a comedy.  Old outdated jet fighters ""sort of"" made to look like a space fighter.

1036628,5,6305475695,"A classic military space opera. The film does a great job jumping into action while painting a detailed universe to get lost in. If you've ever wanted to imagine what a space navy would be like this film does the task quite well. If you like Battlestar Galactica you will feel at home with Wing Commander. If you like sci-fi you can't go wrong with this movie. The ship designs and battles are very well done.

The plot is about a war between humans and the Kilrathie, an advanced war race. The main character, Ty Marshal, is a half blood Pilgram, a minority group of talented space explorers. He attempts to prove himself and use his gifting to save the human race.",1457654400,,666,4.459016393442623
1036720,1,6305475695,This film is supposedly based off a cinematic sci-fi video game of the same name. In actuality this is a WW2 submarine film slightly dressed up and carrying over a few of the  terms from the game. This maybe wouldn't be such a sin if the film was any good at all. I saw the theatrical release and over the years have developed no deeper appreciation for this film. Unless you are just dying to see a space carrier 'submerge' and avoid 'depth charges' you might want to avoid this train wreck of a film.,1457222400,,502,4.28421052631579

1036722,3,6305475695,"Just as the three stars stipulate the movie was just okay.  In a way.  It was a bit early sci-fi-ish.  The vehicles looked like early 1950-sci-fi.  The plot was very difficult for me to pick up.  The explosions in outer space were not realistic enough: fire and sound.  If I was to read it, it would probably be a good B class science fiction adventure",1456876800,,352,4.338461538461538

1036726,4,6305475695,"Underrated. Some of the acting is poor, some of the ""science"" is idiotic, and the Kilrathi look like a Jim Henson fever dream. But the special effects are solid (I'd argue they've even aged decently) and the plot is serviceable. Key selling point, for me, is the unique take on the space sci-fi genre. Everything looks real and weathered, like the Tigerclaw (or Tiger's Claw, if you played the games) should after years of combat and wear.
Overall, it can be corny and silly at some times, but it's a fun ride- especially if you already love the genre.",1456617600,,552,4.585858585858586
1036727,4,6305475695,"This is a very good movie, it just falls short of great.  I like stories where gifted people do not know they are gifted.

1036808,5,6305475695,"Aside from corny seemingly pre-CGI aliens (which are rarely seen in person anyway), I really enjoyed seeing this movie again.  It does a nice job capturing the feel of Wing Commander, which was a series of early PC games.  That and while I feel it compares somewhat to a Battlestar Galactica pilot, it also ups the game vs that earlier show with a more focused plot.  Granted its a little sad when Rosie gets the bulldozer shove out into the vastness of the expanse as space junk.

The action is bad, the acting is terrible, the cast seems bored like they are just going through the motions to get a paycheck.  Freddie Prince Jr. seems very miscast as the lead character.  You don't really even see the evil creatures that the humans are fighting against.  the movie is full of cliche after clich one after another.  We have seen this movie before in better films and TV.  Star Wars, Star Trek, Battle Star Galactica, Top Gun, take your pick.  This movie is just a really bad version of any of those films.  Now if the director would have made this a spoof movie similar to Space Balls or Galaxy Quest it could of had real promise.  The fact is though it seems like a chore just to get to the end of the movie which doesn't come fast enough.  I watched this on HBO because there was nothing else on and it was abysmal.  Like Pacific Rim a bad monster movie this is a bad flight movie.  Many of the CGI effects look fake and phony as well.  I would not even rent this movie or bother wasting your time with it.

1037153,5,6305475695,"I have never seen (nor previously heard of) the computer game of the same name so I can only rate the movie on its own merits.  I would have given Wing Commander four stars, but since someone who hasn't even seen the movie seems to be trolling it with nonsensical 1-star ratings, I'll chip in another star to offset the troll.  The film is mostly unblemished by any noticeable political or social agenda (other the nonsensical notion that women make better fighter pilots, but that dates back 50 years to misrepresentation of the writing of Robert Heinlein and the film doesn't dwell on it) and contains no gratuitous nudity, foul language, or bad grammar; which might explain why the trolls don't like it.

It's humans vs. bad guys in a spaceborne adventure that oddly has gravity to deal with even outside the spacecraft.  The sets and effects are nicely done for a 1999 film, perhaps not the best ever produced but certainly in the same league.  The script was pretty good, convincingly delivered by good actors whose performances might have been better if they had better material to work with.  Direction seemed average for Hollywood major releases but the cinematography felt a little off throughout the film.

Most of the human subplots could have been better developed and the whole theme about the past war between Pilgrims and Earthlings should either have been far better developed or omitted entirely.  It appears that this is a continued subplot from the computer game so perhaps the filmmakers were thinking fans would already know what it's all about.",1451692800,3,1566,4.8830188679245285

1037155,4,6305475695,"I grew up playing the Wing Commander video games.  I loved playing them but more than that, I always imagined stories of the ""expanded universe"" that must have existed outside the game.  What were some of the other adventures of the Tiger's Claw, Concordia, Chris Blair, etc?  I think the Wing Commander movie is a glimpse into that universe.

If you've never played the video games, this movie is going to come across as flat and dull and won't make a lot of sense.  But if you've ""lived through"" the saga of battling the Kilrathi, know what it's like to dogfight dralthi fighters, or trying to survive another few minutes with no shields or armor, the Wing Commander movie is oddly satisfying.

That being said, the video game was actually better produced than the movie.  The game had more tension and drama in its cut scenes as well as better actors (Mark Hamill, Malcolm McDowell, John Reves Davis, etc.).  But again, if you were a fan of the game you'll enjoy the movie.",1449964800,,976,4.601156069364162

Perhaps it was their budget but the ""tech"" was pretty low tech. You could have just as easily made a movie about a soviet submarine with the set.

Effects are good enough, characters are not contrived other than being extreme versions of reality, which is as a movie should be, and the core themes are soulful and full due to character development rather than bastardizations of superficial memes or politics or distracting 'special' effects.  A pure-hearted outcast saving the earth with heroism and integrity, sometimes contrary to the rules of the by-the-book military leader, is all good in my book.  Glorifying military power is certainly problematic these days, but the good-vs-evil picture is pure here, and it's always good to question authority with a pure heart and friends to guide you.  Don't go looking for this kind of clarity in real life with a real gun in your hand if you're not fighting poachers or child-soldier kidnappers, but the message of a warrior heart in service to the greater-good is one thing I love about movies like this.",1449273600,3,1071,4.868131868131868

4 Stars for the movie - I know a lot of folks won't agree with me. But this movie takes me back to the old Wing Commander video games. It will never win any award, but its a sci-fi made for the big screen with some decent fun. Pay no attention to any of the science or the fact that they hear things in space.... vacuum of space only applies for certain plot needs in this movie.

1038730,3,6305475695,"If you can get passed the love stories within the main plot, its actually a really good movie. That said, if you cant, the relationships ruin it. All of this takes place within 12 hours, and in that 12 hours somehow feelings between two pair of pilots grow to the point one was ready to kill himself, and the other was almost ready to let humanity be destroyed. The fact their relationships grew that fast after not going through all that much, honestly, threw a lot off in my opinion. There was also another scene, after one of the pilots died, where the main protagonist convinces the wing commander (The person in-change of the pilots) against continuing a tradition that had apparently been going on for a good while, something the pre-existing pilots were clearly very compassionate about, and it was very out of place and didn't make much sense. Especially after we saw the reaction the main protagonist got after going against it the first time he met the squadron.

Overall, its worth a watch. Is it perfect? No, far from it, but, if you're someone who liked the games, and these type of movies in general, you'll more than likely be able to look past the terrible characters, action, dialog, etc and enjoy the action scenes.",1420588800,,1233,4.655963302752293
1038731,5,6305475695,"This is one of my favorite movies since I first saw it on TV years ago. Most people have never heard of it, but all of my friends I have introduced to the movie have loved it as well. If you are a scifi fan, you really need to check this title out.

The overall plot is interesting. Despite some plot gaps, the story is good and action-packed. The visual effects are all great (though the bad guys look a little cheesy). The science behind the movie, especially behind the FTL jumps is a bit confusing and isn't elaborated on, but is interesting and unique to this title.

I was thrilled to finally own this classic favorite in an HD format for a reasonable price. I strongly recommend that you pick this up and give it a shot.

If I was just rating this specific product (the Wing Commander Blu Ray) I would give it two stars, but I can't bear the thought of people skipping over this title altogether after glancing at a low star count. I think the transfer is really good and the picture looks fantastic. I can't comment on the sound because I don't have anything beyond my TV's built-in system, but there are no obvious audio issues. One significant complaint I have is the complete lack of subtitles. While I understand that the movie is a little dated and came out before universal captioning was required, it would have been nice to have seen at least that token effort for the BD transfer. Also, I would have appreciated a few bonus features (there are none). This movie is based on a game series, similar to the Resident Evil films, so I feel like there was a lot of potential for some interesting discussions of bringing the game to the screen or just talking some about the games.

This film has a lot of pop sheen on many ways attempting to be like top gun in space. Considering how many truely bad films I've seen this is one of those under promoted blockbuster could have been, not as spectacular as the Fifth Element, or as nuanced as Interstellar it does pull you in enough to be considered a genuinely good movie, in this regard its in a leauge with Cowboys and Aliens in my opinion.

The movie has been reviewed to death here, either you like it or loathe it. I happen to like it. I have seen my fair share of crappy sci-fi in my day and this doesn't come close to the bottom of the barrel. Decent special fx, decent story that is worth the watch and at the current prices listed on Amazon (under $10 for both new and used).

I have owned the standard definition DVD for many years and would watch it from time to time. When I saw this blu-ray I thought what the heck, upgrade for a more enjoyable big screen experience. For you hi-def aficionados, you will probably be disappointed. The video upgrade from the standard DVD is unremarkable. There is some additional clarity and sharpness but not consistently through out the film. The audio is a somewhat better upgrade then the video, the major difference I seem to notice is I now here some background noises giving the film a bit more fullness or ambiance.

Is the blu-ray worth the double dip? Heck no. This is not a reference quality blu-ray. Not by a long shot. However, because of the personal enjoyment I get out of this movie, it was worth it for me despite being somewhat disappointed that the overall quality is not that much improved from the DVD version I already own.",1405296000,,1323,4.458677685950414

1038950,4,6305475695,"First of all, no, Wing Commander is not a great film. It has some problems, the most notable being the very underwhelming (to say the least) portrayal of the Kilrathi. However, this is not a terrible film, and if you are a certain type of sci-fi fan, it's not just passable but genuinely enjoyable. Anyone who says that this film is horrible is being a bit more pessimistic than necessary. For its target audience, it's good.

The visual design, when it works, is very interesting. The opening title sequence, in particular, is simply one of the best that you will find in any such genre film, in my opinion. A truly captivating, beautiful creation. To give another visual example, the ship interiors feel like what deep space battleships would actually be like. That may be just the sort of niche quality that suggests an appeal to video gamers and/or sci-fi enthusiasts, but it ties into this film's atmosphere, which when you factor in the mostly excellent cast and solid script, is fairly realistic feeling.

There is also a rather unique, compelling mythology at work in the background of this film's story. It may not be wholly original (I detect some influence from the novel Hyperion, for example) but as far as movies go, this one has a certain quality that sets it apart. On a basic level, yes it appeals to the fascination with being a starfighter pilot in the vein of the first Star Wars film and the Wing Commander video game source material. But there is something more to it, something that is mostly untapped in sci-fi cinema.

There is a great group of characters. I do not know how closely all of them tie into the games, but they feel like real people and again the cast is for the most part very good. Tcheky Karyo, Saffron Burrows, David Warner, Jurgen Prochnow. That's some real talent right there. And the presence of Hugh Quarshie can't help but lead me to note that Wing Commander is parsecs better than the Star Wars prequels in every way except for visual effects budget. The trio of fighter pilots consisting of lead Freddie Prinze Jr, Matthew Lillard and Ginny Holder play more into an ""attractive teen movie"" trope that takes away from the film just a little, but Holder and Lillard especially do a great job of generating some true emotional resonance in the heavy scenes.

Problems? The Kilrathi, who should have been the frightening counterpoint to the human characters, mostly provide unseen menace and when they do make the screen, it is one of the biggest letdowns in any film. Also, some of the Rapier (starfighter) graphics are less than stellar. Those and a few other glitches are what kept this film from being solidly respectable, but they don't keep it from being a lot of fun nonetheless.

I will say again that this is really one of the most unique-feeling sci-fi films that I have seen, and it fills a surprising gap in the number of similarly-themed movies about starfighter pilots. With a bigger budget and maybe a different lead actor, Wing Commander could have been something serious. As is, in spite of its flaws, it's a real gem of a genre film, and well worth checking out if you focus on the positives.",1391558400,2,3155,4.677477477477478

No. I admit that there were problems, but I claim when all the elements have been judicially weighted it has to be reasoned that this is one solid and sound film that has been tarnished by some misguided press and more than a few unfair reviews. This science fiction film fits in genre on the level of a Star War prequel. Take the ""Phantom Menace"". ""Wing Commander"" nearly blows that movie out of the water on pretty much every single category.

The special effects are fairly even. The acting is solid all-around and there is not a whiny heroic kid or a God awful digital gibberish talking goofball clown bouncing about the screen. The overall musical score is close, but there is no contest when it comes to the story. The ""Wing Commander"" story is reasoned and sensible - two things that ""Phantom Menace"" is not. There is never a moment when the logic of the film gives out on you and it is really engaging without having any moment that is far fetched. For its genre there is not a film that comes close to it, beside the Star Wars brand Hollywood doesn't make movies with capital ships and fighters battling it out against an equally match opponents.

Only a few of us escaped the advanced defense systems to possess (2)** 3D NSA-Tesla code cracker - AGM-12 BullPulp guidance system cards, (and the NDC interface kit to make it jive with the rest of your PC computer.  Forget it Apple users. LOL)

Thousands of players found out that a secret Ga-Zizzmo Joystick had a special feature that made killing Kilrathi easy.  HA HA We were THAT CLOSE UNTIL -

A strange new game format was released it was DVD?!  What the ""Starbuck""! Frak is a dam DVD format???  I didn't have room to put a DVD into my 12xArray - Super Computer.

That my friends is when my soul was sucked out of my body by Chris Roberts himself.  A large part of me died then.  Killed by a DVD.

""""""STAND AT ATTENTION!

It is amazing how much institutional drugs that can pass through a human body. (as I lay down today to report!)

They found me hold up ready for battle against the Kilrathi!  It was the dreaded PBJ that got me in the end.  ..sigh..
Is it 1988?  1994?  or maybe later?

still I wait in my cell.  Waiting for Admiral CHRIS ROBERTS to order all able bodied humans to KILL all Cats!

And we will.  We Will!  All ME-OW's will go BOOM! as my Wing Commander swings around to watch my six!

Yes.. I can still dream it!  Fans can still create it!  (And or throw piles of money at Chris Roberts to get off his butt to..  umm)

Anyway.  Here I sit in my small apartment.  An apartment in a small village.

I watch this movie every few years, partly because I was a fan of all of the Wing Commander games and I like how this sometimes tells part of the story (yes I know there are differences, but I'm not bothered by that as some are).

1039223,1,6305475695,"Sometime in the mid 27th Century we as a human race are well versed in space travel, fighting and severe boredom.... I mean war since something called the Terran Confederation is fighting a race of slimy cat people called the Kilrathi, who destroy a Terran base, get a ship and some coordinates that will help them jump through hyperspace to Earth so they can wage war against the humans. Despite the imminent threat the Terran ships won't reach Earth until two hours after the Kilrathi arrive so one ship called the TCS Tiger Claw is charged with the task of holding the enemy at bay until the reinforcements arrive.

The cast makes me shudder, not cause of the actors but because of how they're all forced to spew out this simplistic dialogue and terrible story. Matthew Lillard (""Thir13en Ghosts""), Freddie Prinze Jr. (""I Know What You Did Last Summer""), Saffron Burrows (""Deep Blue Sea"") and Tcheky Karyo (""The Patriot"") are the main actors and boy do I feel sorry for them here, the vaccum of deep space seems to suck all the energy and even life out of every scene.

The villains aren't very freaky, in fact they're quite goofy looking and many cat jokes can be made while watching this, in fact most everything in this movie is worth riffing on and slamming.

I bought it on DVD and then the Amazon rental came with it (some promo they are running - you get a free rental of the movie you just bought), so I do not have an opinion on the quality of the disc or any special features because I have not yet received it. But the movie... Oh the movie...

I'm not much of a sci-fi fan or Freddie Prinze, Jr. fan, but I am a Matthew Lillard fan and I liked Star Trek (2009). So, taking that into account, the movie was not half bad. I had no idea there was a video game or series until I read the reviews on here, so I'm really taking the movie at face value, BUT having seen Star Trek and a few other sci-fi films (like Star Wars and Transformers) and TV shows (like Eureka and Firefly), this one was not an ""A"" movie. The acting was okay - FPJr overdid it just a tad and some of the scenes were just not really believable. They could have spent a little more time developing the relationships between the characters. All you really got was this revealing conversation and boom they're BFFs. In Lillard's and Ginny Holder's case, it wasn't even an entire conversation and boom they're lovers! Although it was fairly short, I liked Lillard's relationship with Holder, though. They kind of brought a little relief from the ""space talk"" and the ""your father was a good/bad man"" and all that drama FPJr had.

Basically, this is your average space movie with aliens (although, again, having not seen the previous stuff on this, I had no idea they were even fighting aliens until about 9 minutes before the movie was over) and a complicated relationship between the male and female lead. They win, the aliens get destroyed and everybody (well, excluding those who died, of course) goes home. It was pretty good quality, as far as the film is concerned, but it WAS made in 1999, which just made everything click for me. It's not the green screen, computer animated stuff we've got in EVERY movie today. They had a little less to work with, but pulled it off.

1039288,1,6305475695,"This was hands down, the best two hours I've had in a theater when I saw it originally.  The reason it was the best two hours, is because it was so bad, the entire audience was spontaneously MST3King it through the whole movie.  It was like attending The Rocky Horror Picture Show, except the jeering and mocking was all spontaneous.

You will see such amazing sights as aliens who look like a mutated versions of Fozzy the Bear, fighters that drop down when launching from their carriers like airplanes, and a military officer telling everyone else on-board their spaceship to stay quiet so the aliens on the other spaceship won't hear them.  Yeah, gotta be careful not to alert your enemies in space by making too much noise.  On a basic level, the director seems to have confused spaceship combat with submarine combat, and The Hunt For Red October this is not.  Physics is taken out into a back alley, beaten within an inch of its life, and left to bleed out.

If you intend to watch this, I suggest you plan on a room full of friends and a lot of alcohol during silly hour, because that's about the only way this is remotely watchable.

I like how movies like this and ""Snakes on a Plane"" have that familiar marketable tag: 'Action-Packed Thrill Ride'.  It's as if there's nothing distinctive or hearty about the movie to sell, so it used a rather stock line.  But while Snakes got away with the tagline by having Samuel L. Jackson yell and curse, ""Wing Commander"" is the opposite of what its DVD tagline is printed.  The film packed as much action as sardines, there's no thrill to be had, and I had a better ride from Teacups.

Visually, this film makes ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" look like J.J. Abrams's ""Star Trek"".  It is cheap, not just how it looks, but how they were shot.  The majority of CGI shots are done in a fixed-camera shot, none of the effects were ever in place next to the actors (which makes them stick out), and whenever there's dogfights, there's a great emphasis on panning; very few extreme or dexterous angle shots to be made.  Finally, the outer space portions look like there were filtered, making everything appear soft and lacking in details.  All of this adds up to show a low-quality movie.

The story is a mix of everything I've seen before and nothing new that's been added: the evil aliens stole a macguffin that would be used to destroy the earth, and it's up to one-half of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Inc/dp/B00006HBUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">'Mystery, Inc.'</a>&nbsp;and the guy from ""La Femme Nikita"" to stop them as well as prove their work to the big bosses.  It does try to freshen things up by adding the prejudice element, by having the main lead (Prinze, jr.) be half of a ancient race, but it's add little to the blandness of the plot.  None of the characters are interesting on paper, and the actors are too bored to even give them spunk; not even Matthew Lillard got his usual overzealousness for this film.  I admit there were a few times where they got me attached, but that's all about it.

""Wing Commander"" is a sci-fi movie that didn't age well visually as well as having a predictable, paper-thin plot.  I'm sure the creator of the video game franchise (who also directed this film) wanted to expose his material to a wider audience, but despite what he made from the games' FMVs I've seen online, he didn't transition into the filmmaking business as well as he hoped.",1280966400,,2500,4.9002375296912115

1039291,3,6305475695,"Have you ever walked into a restaurant and ventured past the dessert case, peered in at a picture-perfect piece of pudding pie? Flaky crust, mile high meringue... Ordered it with high expectations with a cup of coffee and, upon first taste, discovered that the flavor was remarkably similar to cardboard?  A culinary masterwork in every way except one; taste.

This unlikely analogy best describes the Wing Commander motion picture experience.  On the surface it has all of the ingredients that make epic science fiction so tantalizing: A massive struggle between humans and aliens, a cast of lead characters unique enough to be recognized with an action figure line (of which there was back when the film was in theaters), solid visual work from that era just prior to the over reliance upon computer generated imagery, and a legion of pre-existing fans of the property thanks to the popular computer video game series on which the film was inspired.

Yet, and not unlike my above pie example, the experience is unmistakably disappointing, not fully satisfying, and definitely slightly askew.  But before we jump the gun, let's take a look at the facts and stats.

Theatrically released stateside back 1999, Wing Commander had the distinction of sharing science fiction screens with such space epics as Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace and the animated Titan AE.

Runtime comes in at 100 minutes and the film is rated PG-13 for sexual references and sci-fi action/violence.

Based loosely on the plot of the game series of the same name, the film plot unfolds smack dab in the middle of an interstellar war between the Terran Confederation (humans) and the lion-like Kilrathi.

The movie centers on the exploits of 1st Lieutenant Christopher Blair and Todd ""Maniac"" Marshall; a pair of young pilots assigned to the carrier Tiger Claw. With a vibe that sometimes resembles that of 1997's Starship Troopers, Wing Commander emphasizes the space-military life through the eyes of young cadets flying their first combat missions.

It turns out a massive Kilrathi armada is en-route for our lowly blue planet and the Tiger Claw is charged with the arduous task of essentially a suicide mission in delaying the armada's advance in effort to allow the remainder of the Terran fleet time to intercept.

A lot of the drama in the film stems from the simple fact that lead character (Blair) is exposed for being half-Pilgrim; a unique strain of humanity who developed uncanny genetic galactic navigational abilities.  Naturally tensions exist between Blair and his fellow pilots as a result.  Chalk it up to typical human inferiority complex if you'd like.

Now the bad news; while the games were known for their rich acting and sweeping political scope, the film somehow manages to sidestep all of the richness while simultaneously delivering a pretty cardboard script.  Worse still is that somehow the video game incarnations of the franchise managed to secure acting talents much more up to the task of delivering on epic science fiction characters (Mark Hamill and John Rhys-Davies to mention a few).

Perhaps most surprising is that the game's designer Chris Roberts was given the green light to direct the film as well.  The intentions here are clear and really admirable but Roberts' lack of experience in the arena is revealed nearly constantly throughout the picture with cobby plot structuring, strange scene cuts, and what could best be described as odd directorial decisions.  In other words there was specific attention paid to the whole ""Top Gun"" testosterone in space ideal even at the expense of the few plot threads that show potential (such as the technology involved with the navigational device stolen by the Kilrathi which will allow them to jump through worm-holes in space to arrive behind enemy lines).

Additionally no greater a ball could have been dropped than concerning the transition of the Kilrathi from the computer monitor to the big screen.  The Kilrathi in the games were downright frightening at times with their cunning and ruthlessness.  Unfortunately in the film, aside from being terribly rubberized and obviously unmovable, the whole species is depicted as little more than ""an evil alien race bent on universal conquest"".  A shame really when you consider the potential shown in the source material.

Surprisingly, the effects are actually one of the film's greatest strengths.  Digital Anvil deserves credit for rich starfields, nicely textured spacecraft, and some solidly rendered battles.  It should be noted that this era represents a very interesting time in feature film special effect production; when CG was becoming extremely popular but physical (practical effects) were regularly intermingled for realism.  That said the Rapier space fighters featured in the film were actually built from scrapped English Electric Lightning (EEL) jet fighter fuselages.  The attention to detail pays dividends here (even if game fans have, traditionally, had a hard time accepting the visual differences in style).

Stiff acting and a rather lackluster plot actually may have been offset slightly had the original script's concept of dual traitors (Sansky and Admiral Wilson) in addition to more background information about the Kilrathi and their first attack on a space station been retained. The novel, which was based on the film's shooting script, actually includes most of these cuts, proving a slightly richer story arc from which to draw. It is rumored that cuts were made to remove the whole traitor subplot from the finished film since it would have required several additional footage segments focusing on the less than impressive Kilrathi puppets.

In all these are certainly much poorer science fiction films in existence and the crimes Wing Commander commits are certainly forgivable when you stop to consider the strange reality that video games, for whatever reason, never survive the adaptation to film successfully.  Yes there is much to bag on here but at the same time, there is enough space opera substance to argue a strong case that this is one of the finer game translations.

Now consider this, having brought in a meager $11.5 million theatrically, the picture didn't even come close to halfway recovering the $30 million budget 20th Century Fox dumped into creating it! That said it is fortunate we received a DVD release at all.  Science fiction space operas have a disturbing tendency of falling off the face of the earth (no pun intended); I'm still waiting on an official release of 1996's Star Command or 1988's Earth Star Voyager!",1270080000,3,6598,5.143124415341441

Summary (WARNING: May contain Spoilers):

This film was made after the game series of the same name. I like how they present the intro, the glowing regions on the space map representing human colonization. The CG are nicely done. Space combat is well presented. The only problem I had, were the actors; hence why I gave it 8/10. I think Freddie Prinze JR could have done a better job. I felt I couldn't take him seriously throughout the movie. Matthew Lillard had some character. Tcheky Karyo did a fine job. I would recommend this film to anyone who's familiar with the game.",1232755200,11,851,4.716216216216216
1039357,5,6305475695,"Yes, I am impressed!  I remember playing the video games of the same name back in the day, and this movie stuck to the plot of the games as best it could.  Decent sci-fi action, and decent acting make for an enjoyable movie.",1207612800,,224,4.186046511627907
1039358,4,6305475695,"For those of you who are familiar with the Chris Roberts space flight simulator game series, be fairly warned: this movie is not much of an accurate adaptation to the game. Actually it's so different they didn't even need to call it Wing Commander. The setting is there and the character names are there too, but not much else. The ships resemble nothing like those in the game. The characters only show a hint of their game roots. They even mess with the story by adding a different sub-culture of humans. That said Wing Commander does take the whole space fighter genre to a whole new level by incorporating elements of history into the future.

Imagine World War II in space and you will get the look and feel of Wing Commander. The fighters resemble prop fighters without the propellers and the capitol ships resemble a cross between a submarine and an aircraft carrier. You can even hear what sounds like piston engines! I find it an interesting blend, not to mention intriguing. The fighter scenes are really nice. You action nuts should enjoy them. So why do I only give it a four stars? I'll let you in on that....

Some of the sub-plots are annoyingly predictable. One involves a love interest and you just know tragedy will strike just because EVERY other movie does that. And true to form they do it too. Also some of the actions that carry out the sub-plots just don't make sense. For instance a downed fighter is on the landing runway and they are forced to push it off with the pilot still in it because the ships outside are running out of fuel. But later on you find out they have tractor beams. Why not use them?!?! Why not just float in space until they rescue the pilot?!?!? It just doesn't make sense. Fortunately the boneheaded plot twists and ironies are few.

All in all it's a pretty good movie. WW2 aficionados might get a kick out of Wing Commander as well as those of you into fighter pilot movies. Steampunk fans might enjoy it too. Suspend your disbelief for a little while and forgive the teeth grinding predictability in some scenes and you too will enjoy a truly unique space fighter/high adventure film.",1198454400,,2136,4.5718015665796345
1039359,3,6305475695,"SPACE PIRATES!  THE SCOURGE OF THE UNIVERSE!!!  Ok, maybe not.  As some people say, close but no cigar.  Actually, ""Wing Commander"" is based on a plot that has existed since man has been remembering stories.  We have the advancing enemy, we have warriors who have information about where the enemy will attack that can save the homeland if the information gets through.  We have the self-sacrifice of the warriors who stall the enemy long enough for the valuable information to get back to the good guys, who will use the information to advantage to defeat the enemy.  Does this sound a lot like the plot of ""300,"" and dozens of war, science fiction and fantasy stories?  Of course it does, because the story is far from being original.  However, even a story that is a plot retread can still be a lot of fun.

I have already given you the fundamental plot, so here are a few details.  We have the evil Kilrathi out to destroy the universe, or at least the part with people in it.  The Kilrathi have cleverly stolen a NAVCOM A.I. unit that contains earth's jump coordinates.  The Kilrathi cleverly stole this unit by destroying the base that was around the NAVCOM unit.  The crew of the Tiger Claw discovers that the Kilrathi have earth's jump coordinates and must get the information back to the main Confederation fleet so that they can defend earth from the evil Kilrathi horde.

Mixed into this stuff are subplots involving several of the Confederation Rapier pilots.  Rapiers are the space fighters carried by the Tiger Claw.  First lieutenant Christopher Blair is the primary hero of our story as he saves lives, ships and the Confederation with his skills.  More subplots spice things up, including a little romance and prejudice against the Pilgrims, from whom Blair is descended.  However, all of the subplots are mostly distractions from the special effects liberally sprinkled throughout the movie.

I can use a lot of words to describe this movie that are far from kind.  This movie is formulaic, derivative, and shallow.  Some of the movie borders on the absurd.  Here are two examples.

The Tiger Claw broadsides a Kilrathi ship at close range with missiles.  Remember my earlier space pirate comment?  Ships have not broadsided each other for a long time.  One would have destroyed the other long before the broadside.  I must admit the broadside was fun, but hardly plausible.

Another example is the antics of Maniac Marshall (Matthew Lillard) and Rosie Forbes (Ginny Holder).  Since the Tiger Claw is similar to an aircraft carrier, I have to assume that similar rules would apply.  Fighter pilots would not deliberately endanger their ship with the kind of acrobatics that Marshall and Forbes performed during one of their landings.  The risks are too high on a crowded flight deck and such maneuvers would be unthinkable.

As implausible as this movie as, as unoriginal as it is, I still liked it.  As long as I did not think too deeply about the details, this movie was a great one for a bowl of popcorn.  I have to admit that I have watched this movie more than once.  Eek.  I should be embarrassed, but I like the movie.  Fans of movies like ""Starship Troopers"" ""Top Gun"" (which was just about as implausible as this movie), ""Soldier"" and the 1998 version of ""Lost in Space"" will probably like this movie as well.  You might want to note that all these movies have ratings that are similar to the rating of this movie, except ""Top Gun,"" which made it all the way to four stars.  Okay, so this movie is not Shakespeare (though the plot borrows a lot from Shakespeare), but as a fun adventure story, it worked for me.

Good luck!",1191715200,2,3650,4.703001579778831

The combat is never thrilling, but is never boring.  Much closer to Starship Troopers than Star Wars, Wing Commander is sure to satisfy fans of sci-fi movies.

Her review was one of the best, most succinct, not to mention funniest movie reviews I've ever heard.

The intense combination of an intergalactic war-story and a classic Shakespearian love-tale makes this movie an adrenaline-pumping tears-jerker of historical proportion. Mankind can traverse the darkest depths of space, it will always bring along its emotions!

The Kilrathi character-depth is the secret of its success, diminishing the personality of Hamlet to a superficial cartoon-character. While the lines spoken by the Kilrathi have the rhythm of a Swiss watch, it is the depth of their meanings that truly fascinates. Only repeated viewing can reveal the many layers of its message. Once discovered, your will agree that this is what takes Wing Commander beyond the level of the greatest classics of Hollywood or even global cinema.

The people of the future will divide human history in the pre-Wing Commander era (or the Dark Age) and the post-Wing Commander era, when humanity finally became enlightened by this masterpiece and its powerful message. At a lower level, you are bound to forget the part of your life that was spent - wasted really - before you could become a wittness yourself to the brillance that is Wing Commander.

Oscars may be awarded for artistry in film-making, only a Nobel Prize (or several) could do justice to the levels of excellence reached by Wing Commander. This production will no-doubt be remembered by the many generations to come as a turning point in movie-making. How many ages hence, shall thsi our lofty scene be acted over? Its message, when correctly interpreted, will influence society as only the Holy Bible may have done before.

I never tire of watching this movie whenever i flip through channels and see it on-- i have to stop and watch it. The cast is hot, the inuendoes are cool, it has a range of emotions-- for years, i thought the games came after the movie and was surpised to find out there were games of the same name. There is a good mix of seasoned, experienced actors and medium-to-new ones, and the general tone is serious, believable, punctuated with joy and sadness and suspense. It is hard not to cry during a couple parts, when someone dies, or is rejected because of their religion, even though they try to hide it, and i have even seen it soooo many times, and still shed a tear (when someone nice gets picked on in the movie). The loyalty and sacrifice evident in the film is uplifting and inspiring. It's one you get mad or frustrating if u miss the beginning, not because it is hard to catch-up or follow, because it is pretty easy to follow, but beacause if you mis the beginning then you know have missed some good opening scenes and a few bits of detail that only add to the beauty of this tapestry. This is an ultimate classic good one, that far outshines Starship Troopers any day of the week. I think they should have made a sequal (and they probably should advertise those games; i found all but one or 2 of them on sale to try out- AWESOME; can't wait). Definitely a movie you might want to watch every few months, like the Breakfast club or one of the Star Wars movies, or Star Trek. Beautifully conceived and executed.

The acting was terrible.  Why did they not use Mark Hammil and that guy from Back to the Future?  They were awsome actors in the videogames, why not use them?  They are Hollywood actors for crying out loud!  Maybe they wanted nothing to do with this garbage.  Makes sense.

1039502,2,6305475695,"From the start movies based on games seemed to be doomed to failure. Wing Commander, despite probably having a leg up on most other game adaptations because of its much developed storylines, has failed like the others.

The story, while having some interesting plot twists to it, fails to provide much original material. There seem to be a few too many awkard situations created by a subplot about the main characters heritage, which is never resolved and never goes past ""we don't like people of that descent.""

The actors, in particular Freddie Prinz Jr. (Blair) and Matthew Lillard (Maniac), put on a poor performace in every aspect. Neither makes their character interesting: Prinz makes Blair a whiner, and Lillard's performance suggest's his nickname should be ""Idiot"" rather than ""Maniac.""

The costumes were odd, their attempt at a futuristic look fails badly, as the outfits look awkward an ill fitted to their use. Ship designs weren't much better, looking more like cobbled together parts (especially the fighters) rather than a thought-out design.

If you don't know anything about the Kilrathi going into the film, you won't know much more. Little was done to develope the race, and you don't get to see much of them. What times you do see them is in poor lighting, probably to make up for bad animatronics.

The action was the saving grace of this film. The space battles were entertaining, and paired with pretty good effects make for a believable battle. Luckily a fair amount of time is spent on these rather than just the drama between the characters.

If you like space battles, and you can find the movie cheap, I would suggest it, if it's drama and character interaction your into avoid the movie.",1130025600,2,1718,4.88659793814433
1039503,3,6305475695,"Wing Commander, which is of course based on the popular video game series centers around a war between humans and the Kilrathi, a malevolent alien race bent on destroying earth several centuries in the future. The heroes are a rag tag group of fighter pilots led by Lt. Blair (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and his sidekick ""Maniac"" (Matthew Lillard). The plot revolves around the Kilrathi discovering a means of ""Warp Jumping"" into earth territory and the humans desperate attempt to prevent them from doing so. I have never played the video game but have always been a fan of sci-fi. A word to the wise, if you go into this movie expecting a Star Wars like extravaganza, you will be dissapointed. If you go in with the mindset of it being a low budget sci-fi ""B"" movie, you will be pleseantly surprised. In other words this movie is neither great nor horrible. The special effects are so-so, the plot is very thin and cliched, and the acting with the exception of a few characters is only sub-par. Basically, it's not going to win any awards. However, this can still be a very entertaining and interesting movie for the open minded. It's kind of cheesy in a old fashioned b movie style, but that's kind of cool at times. If you put physics, realism and technicalities aside, the movie works on a basic good vs. evil level. The action sequences are entertaining (although every one is a ripoff of either Top Gun, Star Wars, or Das Boot). If you are a fan of any of the above movies you may enjoy this movies alternative take on them. Harmless sci-fi romp that is good if you have nothing else to do on a Saturday afternoon.

Positives:

1. Warp Jumping Idea and special effects associated with it (much cooler and more realistic than the ""Hyperspace"" or ""Warp Speed"" used in Star Wars or Star Trek).

2. Battleship Designs (very militaristic, realistic and functional looking unlike the Millenium Falcon or the Enterprise)

3. Multi-national and Multi-ethnic characters representing humanities unity in the future (British, American, French, Irish, Black, White, and Asian all working together to kill an alien threat. That's definetely cool.)

4. Sexual equality in the future, despite the friendly competative banter (in the future we have gotten over most of the double standards associated with the sexes. Here, women are equal fighter pilots, commanders and even sexual ""players"" as men. Basically they have balls and are still sexy).

Negatives:

1. Plot (kind of weak and unoriginal. The aliens destroying the earth thing has been a mainstay in Sci-fi serials since the 50's and the fighter pilots and battleships in space has been done often and better by some more notable sci-fi movies and shows.)

2. Acting (especially by the star of the movie 'Prinze' was pretty lame. He is just not believable as a hot shot fighter pilot. He should stick to brainless teen slasher or comedy movies)

3. The Bad guys (These Kilrathi have to be some of the most rediculous looking aliens seen onscreen. They are not scary or threatening in any way and remind you of the aliens in ""Galaxy Quest"". At least that film was making a mockery of Sci-fi, but this one actually takes itself seriously)

4. Any Special Effects involving weapons (It's extremely dissapointing that in 500 years, we are still using projectile weapons in the form of machine guns and cruise missiles. Where are all of the lasers, plasma weapons, and photon torpedoes? Even the aliens are using machine guns! Maybe they were trying to be original or something, but with the exception of the ""Skipper"" cloaked missile, the weapons were lame.

5. Obvious scientific and physics errors (I think that most people with a high school level education know by now that sound doesn't not travel in a vacume. Because most other sci-fi shows often ignore this principle I can make exceptions for the sound of the engines, guns, and explosions. But what the hell was all of that sonar pinging and whispering about? ""Quiet or they will hear us"". No they won't! Sonar wouldn't work in space. THEY ARE NOT ON A FRIGGIN SUBMARINE OKAY, THEY'RE IN SPACE!)",1098835200,3,4094,4.801136363636363
1039504,1,6305475695,"As a battle-hardened PC gamer, I tried to put all predjudices aside about Wing Commander (the Movie) and approach it from an objective standpoint. I would say that the movie failed to impress on 3 aspects. First, the movie is not true to the venerable WC game series on any level. Second, it's not good sci-fi. Third, Freddie Prinze Jr. is terribly miscast as Christopher Blair.

 With regard to the first point, I could have lived with the movie taking some liberties with the game series had they been thoughtfully rendered. However, I am wondering why Chris Roberts (the creator of the game) would allow such a maiming of otherwise interesting characters and objects in the WC universe. So many reviewers have pointed out these inaccuracies in the characters, but failed to as the critical question ""Why?""! For instance, why is Taggart no longer a Scotsman? Why is Deveraux no longer French? Does it add something to the plot to change thier ethnicities?

 There are further inaccuracies that will be equally annoying to the diehard WC gamer. Why is the ship's name ""Tiger Claw"" in the movie, when in the orignial game series, it was the ""Tiger's Claw""? Why is Maniac (Lillard) depicted as a loveavle wildman, when his original PC character was an obnoxious coward that was so fun to hate? Where is the ""Iceman"" from the original Tiger's Claw? To reiterate, I don't want to be accused of hair-splitting here, but I didn't see any valid reason why original characters had to be maimed or otherwise excluded from the movie.

 The second, and most important, point is that this was not good sci-fi. Practically the first 45 minutes of the movie are dedicated to establishing the identity of the Blair and Marshall characters, while the nature of relations between the Humans and Kilrathi are addressed as some kind of subplot. This movie claims to be a movie about fighter combat in deep space a la Battlestar Galactica...where's the beef?!

 There's no space combat for the first 45 minutes of the movie, then we get one major battle that lasts for a few minutes and then the movie starts to look like Das Boot in space, with the carrier-ship playing cat and mouse while trying to undergo clandestine repairs. The only other battle in the movie does not involve fighters, but two capital ships squaring off (which is kind of cool), but still no more air-to-air dogfights.

 Top the lack of action off with a general failure to develop the details of the Kilrathi/Human conflict, and you don't have any real story at all. Ultimately, the Blair (Prinze) character is explained as having some sort of special gene that makes him a better pilot than others, but we really never see him prove it to the extent that will impress.

 On another brief note, the special effects are also a bit lacking. Am I wrong, or do those fighters look a bit too much like Norelco razors with wings?

 Finally, while the Blair character is supposed to be the protagonist here, Prinze just does not have the on-screen presence of a Mark Hamill or Dirk Benedict (or even the dude who played Buck Rogers). I liked him in Summer Catch, but, alas, he seems a bit one-dimensional as an actor. Lillard has more charisma. So, honk if you agree: ""Maybe Mainiac should be the Colonel!""!

1039508,5,6305475695,"Wing Commander has been generally hated by the mainstream media reviewers, and their sometimes vehement hatred of the film usually springs from simple misunderstandings that they see in the film which, when seen for what they really are in logical context, are simply silly.
 They criticize that it's too much like a submarine movie-- what's wrong with that! The need for sealing bulkheads is not only practical, but in the context of the movie, totally believable. This isn't ""Star Trek"" or ""Star Wars"" where little force fields are everywhere around the ship to protect it from the vacuum; shields are a big deal in this universe, and only exist in the big ships that can have the power supplies to use them. If a section of the ship is damaged, it's sealed off the old fashioned, simple way-- you seal the doors!
 Sound usage is something that critics also use to rip the film apart. First, we all know that space is a vacuum and that sound can't travel in a vacuum. In a movie like ""Star Wars"" where there's laser-gun sounds and explosions going off all over the place in space where there shouldn't be any noise, yet people don't criticize it for that unrealistic use of sound. Did anybody stop to think that maybe the ""pinging"" noise that the so-called ""sonar"" on the Tiger Claw's bridge was just the noise that its RADAR system made to indicate that it was ""pinging"" off of the Kilrathi Battleship? The reason why everybody needs to be ""shushed!"" is because they thought that the kilrathi fleet had passed by them and that they were safe. They had just gone through a rather intense battle that saw the wounding of their Captain. They were celebrating! They couldn't hear the radar ""pinger"" indicator going off that there was one Kilrathi ship that was still hanging around to search for them, so they had to be shushed. . . and when they hear that pinging, they have to be shushed to hear that their still being looked for. When they hear that pinging, a sign that the Kilrathi are out there still, they all go silent. Yes, this scene is a bit melodramatic with people holding their breaths, but now that the scene is out into actual perspective, it?s understood that they?re not holding their breaths to not be heard by the passing Kilrathi.
 ?Wing Commander? actually has a lot or realistic ingenuity in it. There were no ?laser beams? at this point, so the best natural weapon to use would be bullets (or some form of), which is even more practical when you see that the smaller ships don?t have shielding. To fire bullets is much more practical compared to the taxing and complicated technology of laser systems.  The tractor systems can be explained with electro-magnetic?s, and that?s a technology that we could have developed by the time the movie takes place.
 A lot of people make fun of the Pilgrims ?force? ability to sense magnetic fields and make them easier to navigate. It?s been scientifically proven that inside carrier pigeons cochleas, the fluid that maintains equilibrium is magnetically charge, to a very small extent, allowing the birds to easily find magnetic north and south. That?s why they were so good at doing that. Is it not then possible, that this could happen with humans exposed to gravimetric forces over a prolonged length of time as the Pilgrims did?
 ?Wing Commander? is not the greatest movie ever made. It does have it?s problems. Some of the really great talent? David Suchet, David Warner, Jurgen Prochnow, and Tcheky Karyo? aren?t utilized as well as they really could?ve been. Suchet disappears halfway through the film and we?re given no information as to what happened to him, and Prochnow plays the xenophobic card a bit too much. Warner does a good job of it, and Karyo is reasonably good as the wise but rough Paladin. Freddie Prinze, Jr. is able to carry the film as the young Christopher Blair with great skill, and Saffron Burrows is the tragically tempered Angel. Ginny Holder makes a good break-out role as Rosie Forbes.
 Fans of the video game series (the earlier PC games) will see a lot of their favorite wingmates given breath and form here: Iceman, Knight, Hunter, etc. and Matthew Lillard does a great job of bringing the manic Maniac to life. It?s hard to think of anyone but Tom Wilson doing the part, but Lillard is able to deftly play a funny, crazy, and ultimately caring comrade to Blair, in an earlier stage of development of their relationship, when they had first graduated from the academy and were starting out in the universe. The pilots are frattish, because they?re all young. The Kilrathi are more reptilian than they?ve been in the earlier games, and we don?t see them as well as they?re obscured by smoke and machinery, so they end up looking like overgrown puppets; but they?re not that bad and easily forgiven.
 The effects are excellent, and hold up to those of the ?Star Wars? movies easily. The energy wave explosion effects are especially great, and the sound is great, too. Turn up the speakers high to get a full sensory experience out of the fight and jump scenes. Kevin Kiner and David Arnolds old naval military sounding score brings back the WWII movie epics while adding a good modern flair of excitement. The main Wing Commander Theme is one of the best done in movies, and the opening title sequence is beautiful and stunning.
 Is this movie going to win any awards? No way. ?Wing Commander? is a fun popcorn flick that has more depth than people care to give. It?s much better than the other sci-fi movie released that year, ?The Phantom Menace,? and a good DVD buy. Enjoy and have fun, don?t listen to the detractors!",1051833600,9,5618,4.707019328585961

The best thing about the film is that it has well-developed special effects and quality.  It is also not a difficult story to comprehend, nor is it too unbelievable.  Even the characters are fairly well developed.
Regardless, the movie seems underdone.  The characters, despite their development, don't neccessarily come off as very likable characters.  There are aspects that the film doesn't touch upon, and many of the important scenes of the story are so short that they leave little to the imagination.

1039551,2,6305475695,"I can't imagine why anybody thought this flick had even a ghost of a chance.  Based on the series of ""space-flight sims"" that ruled PC gamers' attentions until about the mid-1990's, WC pits a hardy band of fighter jocks in their space-fighters against a vile and thoroughly genocidal race called the Kilrathi (obviously descendants of some predatory feline with glowing eyes and grunting voices).  In the future, mankind has developed hyper-space travel that allows people to ""jump"" to distant points of the cosmos, where he presumably meets the Kilrathi.  Controlling this array of jumping starships is a master computer called the Navicom - which is captured by the Kilrathi in the first scene.  Now, only a single ship - shuttling fighter pilots to a new sector - stands between the Kilrathi and Earth.
So what's wrong with this movie?  Let's start with the non-existent story.  The basic idea of WC was fine for gaming where interactivity was enough to make you overlook how strangely familiar everything was - whether it was ""Star Wars"", ""Babylon 5"", ""Battlestar Galactica"" or ""Space: Above and Beyond"" or a host of Japanese Anime, there wasn't anything in WC that you hadn't seen before.  Turning the story into a movie that you had to watch passively only highlights that sense of deja-vu to everything in sci-fi gaming (even the score, which I loved, shows its roots to ""Galactica"").  Even getting past a terminally derivative premise with its roots in everything, you get a ton of lame effects and low production values.  CGI space scenes look no more compelling than what you get on ""Babylon 5"" and only remind you of the flick's beginnings as a franchise of video games.  For a movie, the sets look very uncinematic - more like something you'd see on a ST: TNG clone on one of the upstart networks.  Though set hundreds of years in the future, the interiors of spaceships here look as primitive those of U-boats, with exposed piping and circuitry.  Actually, this could have worked had they been modeled after convincing U-boats or other WWII surplus.  Though this would have made ""Tigerclaw"" look like the ""Nostromo"" from ""Alien"", it's better than the alternative which painfully trails in set design behind a movie released 20 years earlier.  The interior scenes during battles only reminds you how far ahead of its time ""Wrath of Khan"" was.  Then there are the leads - Freddie Prinze and Saffron Burrows are actually sympathetic characters, but their surprising likeability only reminds you how painfully uninspired the flick is.  The plot develops Prinze's character as one of an all-but-ostracized religious sect called ""Pilgrims"" who don't otherwise appear in the games, and get little fleshing here.  The producers throw in some major talent - David Warner, Tcheky Karyo and Jurgen Prochnow - who are familiar in Sci-Fi as reliable character actors, but that only makes you wonder if the producers had spent their money in the right place.  In short - don't rent or buy, this flick is a perrenial appearance on the Sci-Fi channel, though you're only likely to catch it once.",1042416000,,3092,4.947775628626692

The implausibility factor of this movie is high, there is sound in space, the fighters fly like aeroplanes, there is a quasar in the Sol system and so on. However weighed against that is an entertainingly different way of looking at space battles - that is - more like Das Boot than Star Trek, the ships are small and cramped and battered, the people are jittery and the whole enterprise looks like it's one asteroid short of oblivion. There are also no fancy lasers or energy weapons, just missiles and pellet throwers.

1039655,3,6305475695,"I must admit, I watched the film ""Wing Commander"" with pretty low expectations. And maybe that's why I found the film to be reasonably entertaining--despite some stupid or annoying elements. The film depicts an interstellar war between humans and an alien race called the Kilrathi. Most of the drama focuses on a wing of outer space fighter pilots; the main hero is played by Freddie Prinze, Jr. Comic relief is provided by his sidekick and fellow fighter pilot, Matthew Lillard.
There are some reasonably fun and action-filled scenes, but as a whole the film is weak. The whole ""fighter pilots in space"" thing has been done before (and better) in ""Star Wars"" and ""Babylon 5."" There are too many cliches and unconvincing plot points, and I found the anticlimactic ending to be rather unsatisfying.
One interesting angle to the film is the fact that Prinze's character is the son of a ""Pilgrim,"" a sort of human sub-species that evolved from early human space travelers. But this angle is not explored in a convincing or satisfying way. It merely becomes fodder for a shallow, cliched subplot involving the prejudice against these ""Pilgrims."" Also shallow is the portrayal of the barely seen Kilrathi. These aliens seem to have no personality beyond their desire to kill humans.

I am also a diehard computer game freak and own all the Wing Commander games, including Wing Commander: Academy, Wing Commander: Privateer, and Wing Commander: Armada.  I also have all the novels and I can tell you that this movie stunk. When I first heard they were making this movie I began salivating.

But as with all video game based movies before it (read Super Mario Bros. and Street Fighter) this movie failed to live up to expectations.

But I won't do that.  I will simply say that for someone who is such a big fan of the games, and is so easy to please when it comes to movies, that this should be a good indication of what to expect from this movie. What Chris Roberts should have done, in my opinion, was adapt the first game into a screenplay for the movie.  Also, he should have let someone else direct it, someone with more experience directing and not so close to the material.  Don't get me wrong, I liked his take on the Terran-Kilrathi War.  But I also liked Wing Commander: Prophecy, which he had nothing to do with, and I liked Starlancer, which he did.

However, when judged on its own merits, ""Wing Commander"" is a decent space adventure film.  So what if it is not Shakespeare and so what if its different from the game?  This film combines fantastic special effects, great battle sequences, and rather compelling characters and character conflicts.  We have Lt. Blair who must deal with his half Pilgrim heritage.  We have Lt. Marshall who's recklessness gets him into trouble.  We have Lt. Commander Deveraux, a woman who's cold exterior is her defense against loosing friends to the war.  Then there is Taggert, a wise space pilot who has a hidden identity.
All of this makes ""Wing Commander"" a space adventure film worth seeing.  If one does not nitpick the film to death, ""Wing Commander"" is a fun and enjoyable film for science fiction fans.  Don't listen to the critics and the disgruntled fans of the Wing Commander game.  If your looking for a fun scifi film, get ""Wing Commander"".",983664000,80,1257,4.854460093896714
1039716,3,6305475695,"As a diehard Wing Commander fan, I had been anticipating this movie long before it had come out. Constantly going to websites almost daily to see how it was coming along. Unfortunately once it was finally released and I heard the terrible reviews, I decided not to go see it. This might seem strange to many of you, but as a hardcore fan I did not want to be disappointed as many other Wing Commander fans were.

Recently I saw the movie when a friend of mine bought it on video. Although I was prepared for the worst, I was pleasantly surprised. I now definitely think that the critics were too hard on this film.

Not as good as the Star Wars series, upon which the games were totally inspired and loosely modeled, to me this film still stood on its own. What made the movie worthy of this position? Well, plain and simple, it was the space battles. Watching large ""capital ships"" fighting with each other and small fighter craft zinging between them was very cool. All the battles were done in the unique way that only the wing commander universe could do them. Also the fine cast of actors (minus Freddie) made the non-battle scenes at least watchable (my favorite actors were the ones that played Maniac, Paladin, and Angel).

It's very unfortunate that the movie's story did not follow the story found in the original games more closely. While changes don't bother me in general, in this case quite a few of them were really bad. For instance, while I understand why Chris Roberts did it, the whole ""Space Pilgrims"" thing, came off awkward and rather cheesy. He clearly wanted to put in something ""sensational"" like Luke Skywalker's Force powers to excite the audience. Sadly, however, the ""Pilgrim"" power took out any sort reason to worry about any of the characters, especially Blair. Even with the different storyline, I had no doubt that everything would be fine at the end because our hero had to survive so his supernatural space powers could save the day. In the games you were just an ordinary person trying to stop a Kilrathi fleet with just one carrier and your various wingmen, and that's gritty, realistic, and intense. Also, unlike with the games, the style of the technology in the movie was overdone to the point where it passed sci-fi realism (with its combat basis trying too hard to capture the World War 2 era). All in all, I suppose the best way to sum up my disappointments regarding the changes would be to say that if they wanted to change a cool plot point or theme, they should have replaced it with a better one, not an obviously worse one. I think that is why most Wing Commander fans were angry (the game series is well known for its amazing themes and plot points).

Another major problem with the story is the way it fails to connect us to the characters. Again, by contrast, in the games you formed close emotional bonds with the various characters, but in this movie I didn't really care about any of them. What little feelings I did have were quickly erased by bad dialog or awkward scenes. For instance, there is a death scene that could have been a lot more emotional if only the story could have done it right. Also, there is a scene where Angel's life is in danger and Blair has to make a hard choice that was totally ruined by the story and lacked any believability. The characters had potential, but that potential fell very short.

Lastly, the factor I disliked about this movie more than anything was the Kilrathi. What the heck happened? Instead of the ultra-cool, ritualistic warrior race of feline aliens, we get badly animatronic'ed hairless cat monsters with glowing eyes? Their ""strong shall rule"" beliefs, ruthless political structure, and deadly battle tactics were totally absent in this movie. Instead we get some strange race that we never see anything of and come off as clich&eacute; evil space monsters that are blindly out to destroy everything. Not only are the Kilrathi in this movie absurdly one-dimensional but they are also completely inept as warriors. I understand that in a game you want to make the enemies weaker so a player can defeat the bad guys, but in a movie you need to provide more tension than that.

All in all, it was a fun movie that had neat sci-fi effects and battles, especially considering its budget. But with all of the downsides though, it is definitely a movie that will disappoint a lot of people, especially Wing Commander fans.",982540800,,4422,4.641123882503193

I can still recall all the thrill of the action, patrols, dog fighting, etc. Then personalities - how I hated Maniac sometimes for his stupid behavior!  Unfortunately the movie brings nothing from that thrill. It's just an average sci-fi movie loosely tied to the original computer game.

Granted it was interesting to see young Christopher Blair's first deployment (seeing as he's one of the great heroes of the whole story), but it was ruined by the whole Pilgrim angle on the story line.  In addition, screwing up the character of James Taggart (aka 'Paladin') did nothing to aid the progress of the plot.

1039719,5,6305475695,"""Wing Commander"" is the type of movie that should include the following warning: ""If you don't appreciate wartime combat drama, historical war movies, or sci-fi/fantasy action, then don't even try to like this movie!"" Too many people who don't like such genres go to watch these types of movies in which they don't understand much of what is being shown. Then they start badmouthing it, tsk tsk. Please, judge the movie based on its premise and don't try to fit it into something it isn't. Only the true afficionados know enough about the genre to talk about it's details, don't you think?
Like all true war stories, Wing Commander has the quality of having ""long periods of boredom interrupted by moments of sheer terror"" (this is really how war veterans describe combat). However, much of the ""slow and boring"" scenes involve setting the cultural and personal background of the characters, discussions of strategy and logistics, vignettes in the barracks life of fighter pilots, tedious waiting while hiding from the enemy, etc. This might seem pretty humdrum to most civilians but I'm sure real-life airmen and submarine jocks in the Armed Forces will relate to that. In this case, director Chris Roberts has captured that essence of warfare, although I liked the way he managed to fit in a lot of emotional scenes showing the group's camaraderie and some romance.
The action scenes are both fast and furious, as well as suspenseful and stealthy, with many technical references to electronic warfare, space navigation, space-combat maneuvers, especially engineering and weaponry. Who else but a techie and a hard-core combat gamer would wallow in such ""trivia""? (He he he, I did, and I loved every second!) I liked the way the production crew paid attention to the uniform insignia, vehicle decals, head-up display info, and other minutiae of a military unit heading into harm's way. The acting is above-average as the main characters unveal the plot to prevent the malevolent Kilrathis from destroying Earth's defenses.
If you're a World War II enthusiast, watch this movie! It's just like watching the films ""The Battle of Midway"" or ""U-571,"" especially with Jurgen Prochnow there of ""Das Boot"" fame. It has so many references to aircraft carrier and submarine tactics, plus a few piratical ""board and storm"" actions, that you could be watching a Horatio Hornblower movie (oops, am I mixing time lines here?). So if you don't like military sci-fi action combat dramas, watch something else. If like such stuff, put this gem into your collection and watch it several times! That's the only way you'll learn exactly how the Terran fleet managed to upstage the Kilrathis. And yes, I really hope there's a sequel....",979171200,4,2717,5.04

1039722,4,6305475695,"This part of the review is for the veterans:
I have played every Wing  Commander game so far (including every add-on disc) and I can recommend  this movie to everyone, who  blew the Kilrathi across deep space, too.  Although the story takes place before the first Wing Commander game, it is  not that much of a problem that Chris Roberts mixed a few items from later  WC games into this movie (like the Snakeir battleship, Admiral Tolwyn or  the Skipper Missles). Okay, the special effects are better than Starship  Troopers or  even Star Wars Episode 1, but why was it necessary to change  the look of all the capital ships and fighters that much? The Tiger Claw  (why not Tiger's Claw???) does not look like the Bengal-class carrier to  me, but more like a battleship that  happens to have a few fighters on  board. Anyway, although some people might miss an actor resembling Colonel  Halcyon, Jrgen Prochnow and Tcheky Karyo are doing a good job as the good  guys (ever noticed that the Kilrathi ships were PINGING in order to find  the good guys? - ""Das Boot"" must be  around somewhere -  especially with all those torpedo battles during the movie). What is REALLY  fascinating about this movie is the soundtrack! Honestly, I have never EVER  heard anything better since Star Wars (especially ""The Imperial  March"" of ""The Empire Strikes Back"") or Dark Star. So, if  you know the games, and liked them, the movie is a DVD/VHS that is worth  being had. Enjoy!
This part of the review is for the rest of the  world:
Okay, okay! I know that even uninhabited asteroids would have been  better actors than the ""young heros"" of the movie. I know that  everyone, who does not know the games, does not understand the story. I  also know that some people might think that after hiring Jrgen Prochnow  (Das Boot) and Tcheky Karyo (Goldeneye), there was no cash left for writing  a good story or hiring more known actors (but that worked with Starship  Troopers!!).
But hey! This is a movie for the fans of the game! Chris  Roberts has put his dream on the screen and his efforts are worth it! This  movie isn't perfect, but for those, who like the topic, it is a good piece  of entertainment.",968976000,10,2186,4.577720207253886

What's nice about this film is that the story is everything. The  acting is all right--not bad, but in general not fabulous either.  But what  this film delivers is essentially a classic World War II submarine/carrier  story set in space. It's got action moments and tense waiting game moments,  but the story focuses mostly on the fighter pilots (for obvious reasons) so  there's plenty of gunfire and stunt flying to go around.
The effects  serve the story here, not vice-versa. Bullet time was thrown into one  pulsar-jump sequence, following its brief success in Lost In Space and  before it was used so extensively in the Matrix; previews sadly made the  movie seem like an excuse for that effect, but the movie stands up just as  well without it. Nothing looks especially CGI or goofy. Not too much flash,  not too little.

1039766,3,6305475695,"The story is paper thin.  The Kilrathi were too stiff.  There were too many holes in the plot.  There were unrealistic physics.  The list goes on...
So why did I like it?  Maybe because I was not expecting much.  The  director, Chris Roberts, was the creator of the Game ""Wing  Commander"", and he directed the cinematic scenes in two games.  But  that's all he had to his credit.  In my book, he has done a remarkable job  for someone not in the field.  The budget of the movie was also  restrictive.  But that did not slow the show.  And also to be noted is that  the movie is based on a computer game.  In movie history, that is usually a  penalty.
The acting is on par... with the rest of the teen flicks out  there (where acting performances rely mostly on good looks).  The music is  a amazingly good, however.  You might replay a scene just to hear the music  over and over (well... I liked it).  The space flight action scenes are  also well done.
But the plot hurts the movie.  I think there were too  many scenes that were cut-out, making the final product filled with  unexplained scenes.  I was mystified by the meaning of quite a few  events.
The movie as a whole could be summed up as fun, light no-brainer.  Do NOT consider it as a ""gritty WWII in space"" adventure, as the  director assumed it to be during an interview.  It is just entertaining, if  you don't compare it to something like ""Star Wars"".

There's a running gag-type thing about the  distinction between a suggestion and an order that I thought was kind of  cute, even though they used it way more often than I'd expected.

""Wing Commander"" isn't one of  them. ""Wing Commander"" is just plain bad. I keep comparing this  movie to ""Starship Troopers"", another bad film but one I enjoyed  throughly.

-the acting  talent assembled underwhelmed me. The actors are young, inexpirienced, and  not particularly interesting. None have any sort of presence to convey. Say  what you want about ""Starship Troopers"", but at least the actors  and actresses looked good battling those bugs and they looked like they  were having a good time. The actors and actresses in ""Wing  Commander"" have mistaken this movie for a scifi ""Saving Private  Ryan"" or something, trying to attach great insight to what can only be  described as a poor script.
The career of Freddie Prinze Jr (Maverick)  will survive this, but I can only pray Matthew Lilliard's (Maniac) does  not. The less said of the rest of the cast the better.
-The fighters  look silly, like WWI biplanes instead of 27th century weapons. The ships  looked unimpressive and the warfare portrayed was ridiculously done. It  looked slapped together at the last minute without any sort of  inspiration.
-The screenwriters showed a total lack of imagination  cribbing tidbits from submarine movies to fill up the action sequences and  inserting lame and cliched war movie dialouge into the characters mouths.  At one point in the movie, during one particularly tedious speech about  sacrifice and loss, my friend looked over at me and let out an exasperated  sigh.

I felt I owed the memory of those games a full viewing, I was wrong.  Apart from some  occasional good special effects the story line was crass and the acting was  dubious.  The Kilrathi hardly featured and when they did they looked like  something out of a bad 50's b-movie.  They are supposed to be heartless,  warrior cat like beings, but are about as scary as miss piggy.
Blair is  half pilgrim on his mothers side.  People generally don't like or trust  pilgrims and bad mouth him and his father because of it.  He is a rapier  pilot and must be  reasonably intelligent, and yet it took Paladin, another  pilgrim, to tell him the most basic historic facts as to what a pilgrim  actually is.  I know the audience needs to be informed, but come  on.....

I am overwhelmed by this Giant sleeping on our 'New Releases' video store sections!
This is what astronomers would call a ""Sci-Fi Supercluster""!  What the French  would call a ""Tour de Force!""  What an American audience honed in  would call ""Star  Wars for Grown Ups!""  what musicians and the  appreciators and lovers of music would call, ""Music Marshalled  Magnificate!""

Cinematic Science Fiction Will hark back to this  Golden Glory!  I promise!  There are not stars enough bespeckling the dark  gilded globe of night to measure this  Masterpiece!  We recieved the old  U-Boat Commander, the old Sleuth, the Time Traveller, and Nostradamus too!  What More and what more Beautiful leadership  could we have asked for?  Where were We in these scarlet hours with tin Rapier crates and a People  United under  Pilgrims?  Methinks there is nothing ""new"" under  ""Silla's"" grasp, nor under Sol, nor star, nor history's past.
Some movies just knock you flat with their ensembled technical and  melodic perfection.  This is one among the few I can count to.  Just  viewing the movie's intro  credits and theme montage gives me shivers,  ""nothing I've ever seen before""  WOW!  I remember that line  spoken in the film's scence obseving the unsteady  recklessness of youthful  moxie machismo, and I think it applies to this review:  ""Now, what  were you saying?""--Black Pilot.

1039924,4,6305475695,"Wing Commander is most certainly one of the finest computergames of the last decade. Nevertheless, the jump onto the big screenseems to be only partially successful.
The motion picture combines elements of the saga's first three parts. We again see the Tiger's Claw (renamed as Tiger Claw - oh my...) and the Concordia as well as the Rapier fighter. The appearance of all ships is disappointing, though: In the original computer game the Rapier was a smooth fighter with multiple energy cannons; in the movie we encounter a Rapier with a MG-like weapon.
The movie's plot is all new and all main characters are introduced quickly. While Maniac is still the same old first-shoot-than-think, Blair's relation to the Pilgrims comes unexpectedly and gives the role a whole new aspect. We also meet Angel, Paladin, Bossman and Admiral Tolwyn.
In summary, Wing Commander is a fascinating movie but not as great as the computer games. Knowing the games helps a lot in understanding the plot. As for the rest of you, who did not endure countless battles against a fierce Kilrathi strike force: Do yourself a favour and rent the movie before buying it. It may save you some money.",949449600,,1170,4.884422110552764
1039925,4,6305475695,"Wing Commander a movie based on a computer game series, not excactly the most flattering reputation to have. Considering the likes of disaster video game to movie transfers like ""Street Fighter"" ""Super Mario  Bros."" and ""Mortal Combat"". But surprisingly enough this  movie had a few tricks up it's sleeve. Some of them even gave a run for the  money for a picky viewer like me, and that's seldom. Even though I watched  the movie on my own home entertainment center on DVD format(Digital  versatile disc, movie on cd format), I was surprised over the massive dolby  digital sound effects as well as the astonishing special effects,  brilliantly programmed by the Digital Anvil effects corporation. The DVD  sleeve states, and i quote ""An action packed thrill ride!"", this  is actually one of the most used clichs in movie critique, but I actually  think that this is one of the movies that really deserves the use of it.
The movies storyline is as before mentioned built on a computer games  series, Wing Commander. The Wing Commander series, which consists of 5  games(the last three being interactive movies starring Mark Hamill as  ""Lt. Blair"". Mark Hamill is also known for his performances as  Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars movies), was created by the Englishman  Chris Roberts as well as directed by him. Chris Roberts also directed the  movie, as well as creating the storyline and characters which were taken  from the third computer game in the series ""Wing Commander 3 - Heart  of the Tiger"". Having played the game, I might ad that he did a  brilliant job in bringing the characters from the interlaced computer  screen to the silver screen.
The storyline in the movie takes us on a  journey with Leutenant Christopher Blair(Freddie Prinze Jr.) a half human,  half pilgrim(the first human space explorers, believed to have developed  amazing navigational and space exploration skills). Blair is introduced to  us as a pilot commanded to relieve a pilot post on the battleship Tiger  Claw. On his way to the Tiger Claw he recieves a message from Admiral  Tolwyn aboard the cruiser ship ""T.C.S Vanguard"" stating that the  space station ""Pegasus"" had been destroyed by the Kilrathi. An  evil race of human sized space cats on two legs, which are really the only  big downer in this movie(Not because of that they're an evil race of human  sized space cats on two legs, but because of their poor design. Which  deviate from the original design they had on the computer game, in which  the Kilrathi were brilliantly designed by the way). The Kilrathi had also  gotten their paws on some critical navigational data to jump-point  coordinates leading to earth. Joining Leutenant Blair in his fight against  the evil cats is leutenant Todd Marshall(Matthew Lillard). A loose cannon,  appropriately nicknamed Maniac. Fresh out of flight academy Lt. Blair and  Lt. Marshall don't know what to expect but they could never imagine the  fate that awaits them.... The storyline let's the people who have played  the game recognize many of the old characters as well as meeting new ones.  The storyboard could easily have been adapted as an addition to the game  series. But as well as giving the old Chris Roberts junkies alot of rewards  for being faithfull gamers, a viewer who is totally unfamiliar with the  Wing Commander concept can join in and have as lot fun as the old fan. And  those new viewers who enjoy it might continue the adventure by themselves  through the Wing Commander games. So you might say it can be enjoyed as a  total experience. First see the movie, then play the games.
The  perfomance of Freddie Prinze Jr. is astonishing as Lt. Blair. Although we  know him as a teen idol for girls through movies like ""I know what you  did last summer"" & ""She's all that"", this is his first  film were he also appeals men as both an entertainer and actor. His idol  image is still there, but his handling of space crafts and fighting makes  him a more macho idol than before. This gives him leverage to give his  character both a sensitive and a masculin side, which let's the plot  include spiritual content as well as the action. Before mentioned Matthew  Lillard is also a name to look out for in future coming movies. Known for  his portrayals of complicated, deranged teens in films like  ""Hackers"", ""She's all that"" and ""Scream"", he  knows how to play somewhat of a maniac. But we also get to see the more  serious sides of his acting talents, which could mean a major shifting  point in his career. Because of director Chris Roberts nationality, he has  been smart enough to take in many of Europe's most experienced and talented  actors as well as his standard american cast. The most known of the  European cast are, Frenchman Tchky Karyo(""Commodore Taggart"".  Starring in films like Goldeneye, Dobermann and Badboys), German Jrgen  Prochnow(""Commander Gerald"". Starring in the giant European  blockbuster Das Boot), British talents include Saffron  Burrows(""Devreaux""), David Suchet(""Captain Sansky""),  Ginny Holder(""Rosie Forbes"") and David Warner(""Adimral  Tolwyn""). Each and everyone of the European actors are known as  serious character actors. Some of them have even taken former characters  they've acted and used them as inspirational sources for their roles. One  great example is Jrgen Prochnow starring as ""Commander Gerald"",  who uses, in my belief, his greatest performance ever. His role as the  U-boat captain in Das Boot, to power boost his portrayal of the Tiger Claw  ""Commander Gerald"". Other European performances worth mentioning  are Saffron Burrows as the wing Commander who get's involved with Lt. Blair  and Ginny Holder as the fighter pilot who falls in love with Lt. Marshall.
This is a blockbuster movie with a good story, terrific acting, an  exhilarating score composed by Kevin Kiner and special effects that will  blow you away. Whatelse could you ask for in a movie!  I hope this review  gave you some insight to the movie as well as the urge to go see it.

1040027,3,6305475695,"Wing Commander never made it to local cinemas over here to Singapore, so I watched this movie on DVD. Being an avid computer gamer, I've played all the Wing Commander space-simulation games since 1992, and being also a huge  fan of the genre, didn't spare a second thought when I picked up this disc.
First off, I'm afraid that plotwise, it's not too much to go by;  ultimately, the script is a ""Top Gun in Space"" derivative. For  those of us who're not aware, Wing Commander is the computer gaming  equivalent of Star Wars. For folks who're aware of how events actually  transpire in the actual Wing Commander genre, this movie does change  several key elements of the established storyline. That goes both ways;  it'll bother purists who do know how the inter-galatic war eventually turns  out (as presented in the videogame, Heart of the Tiger); on the other hand,  the different plot should keep even these purists interested at the  probable ""alternate"" history of the war. The special effects,  space dogfighting, and capital ship action though somewhat rough around the  finer edges, is still nevertheless exciting and satisfactory, considering  the very limited budget of $30 million that director and creator of the  Wing Commander series Chris Robert had to work with. Even then, perhaps  Robert was trying too hard to be different from the ""other""  inter-galatic space-war franchise, particularly in the focus on  fleet/small-craft action. But in so doing, some of the ship modelling-  particularly that on the use of ballistic projectiles in ship weaponary did  come across as rather jarring, even for those who were willing to cut a lot  of slack for this new-comer motion picture.
Cast wise, Freddie Prinze  made for a rather faceless Christopher Blair, although he's still pretty  likable as a character within the confines of the 2 hour movie. The role of  Jeanette Devereaux (imho) would have been better suited for Sophie Marceau-  Saffron Burrows is nice to look at, but didn't impress. Perhaps the most  successful of the trio of main leads is Matthew Lillard, which provided for  an alternate, believable Tood ""Maniac"" Marshall when compared to  Thomas Wilson's top-notch portrayal of the same in the video games.
So,  overall; I still like this motion picture just fine. Folks who've played  the games should definitely try this one out- it's a fun, 2 hour romp. :)",944870400,,2387,4.9873096446700504

Some say there is bad acting, which I personally think is untrue - that seems to be a matter of opinion, and therefore nobody should judge this film on such a  viewpoint that is clearly not shared by all.  For example, not every Sci-Fi  fan likes Star Trek or Star Wars.  Doesn't mean either of them are  substandard.
So, I urge people to ignore things people say about this  film and see it for themselves.  I for one can say, I'm not being blindly  devoted to Wing Commander in general, as, for example, I do not  particularly like the second game in the series.
The FX in this film are  mind blowing at times - even the most subtle scenes look wonderful - eg a  shot where the camera pans across space and in through the viewport of a  ship and inside the cockpit to view a conversation between two characters,  all in a single shot.
As for the direction, I was very impressed with  Chris Roberts in Wing Commander IV.  I was looking forward to seeing what  he'd do with a full motion picture, and it was well worth the wait.  From  the beginning titles to the last shot, it was very richly directed using  excellent and often inventive visual and audio techniques.
Speaking of  audio, the music in this film is fantastic.  Although many fans were  probably hoping for some of the music from the games (the first one had  hugely atmospheric music) it was not a disappointment in the end.
I  agree, there is much about this film that can be argued with, but I would  say the same about almost any film - especially Sci-Fi movies.  There are  whole websites devoted to picking holes in Star Wars, but, to me that's  just part of the fun.  The things I think stand out in Wing Commander, are  a couple of plot devices and events that are necessary, but that could have  been accomplished a little more realistically.

The characters and situations are not  especially original, however Tcheky Karyo is as cool as he was in the  original ""La Femme Nikita,"" and newcomer (to me anyway) Saffron  Burrows has a nice presence as well.  The naval motif is quite refreshing  in it's own way and the limits of the script are not so noticable if you  put your player on pause every so often and get something cool to drink.  An entertaining B-movie.",931564800,,593,4.571428571428571
1040457,2,6305475695,"This DVD depicts a fictional battle for the earth between the ""Confederation"" and the ""Kilrabi"" (Think the Federation and the Klingons).  The movie is visually stunning with excellent  definition and color saturation.  The 5.1 Dolby Digital Soundtrack is of  reference quality and one of the best I have heard on DVD.  Unfortunately,  the plot is very poorly developed and the movie is populated by people who  you care absolutely nothing about.  The story is almost non-existent.  This  is a disc you rent to enjoy for its wonderful soundtrack which really  defines the benefits of 5.1 digital sound, but after having seen it once  you don't need to own it.",931305600,,658,4.935779816513762

7890110,3,6305475695,"It's slightly better than I remember it being, if you're a fan of the original P.C. Games, then this film will probably disappoint you. Another reviewer said if you watch it as a 50's SciFi film, it makes the movie better, I can see that,and really, you can't help but think what could have been, had they stuck with the ship designs of the Games (which were excellent), and made some cast changes. The main plot is pretty simple, and it actually could have been a pretty gripping story with some tweaks and eliminating some of the side stuff (like some of the mystical ""chosen one"" drivel with the main character) This could have been something great, the bones of a truly epic space opera are there, potentially something that could have launched a franchise, but alas, trying to pander to hip 90's teens killed this one.

Pro's:

It's got David Warner, Jurgen Prochnow, and Tcheky Karyo in it!

The main plot of a lone ship having to play mouse to a whole enemy fleets cat while trying to buy time for a counter attack is solid, really, just with this alone, they could have gone Das Boot meets Battle of Midway and this movie would have been off the charts if done right.

The capital ships designs aren't bad. nor are the sets of the ships interior. Even MOST of the costumes are decent.

Cons:

Freddy Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard are the Leads!

The side plot with the Pilgrims is groan inducing, that whole ""Mythos"" should have been left out.

Why Why Why did they change the Fighter designs? You had perfectly good ones from the GAMES! Just take those models and detail them so they are suitable for movie use! They had to know fans of the games would have loved to see their favorite ships flying around on the big screen! And why would you need an oxygen mask but not a helmet or a space suit in a space fighter? The headgear was terrible, the flight suits were acceptable though.

The Kilrathi. Oh Man.....If you've played the games I need say no more. The film would have been better off just not showing them (just their ships) if it was a budget problem with realizing them ""properly"" on screen. You could have just shown a screen shot of one during a briefing scene or played back some audio during a ""intercepted transmission"" or something. The boarding scene was pretty much a waste of the films budget that could have been waaay better spent elsewhere.

Overall, I am glad I picked this film up, if only to add to my ""terrible live action movies based on video games"" section of my physical media collection.",1511654400,,2529,4.502183406113537
7890111,4,6305475695,"Appreciably corny in all of the right cliche ways.

There's just something about the complete lack of military semblance in all regard, remarkably predictable plot twist events, comical allusions and thick nostalgia glasses for the games that make this truly the 90's space-opera version of ""Top Gun"". No matter how incredible the tropes are, how blatant the disregard for physics are, or how nauseous you can get from hearing Matthew Lillard's surferbro laugh, Wing Commander will still be the same movie I fell in love with back then.

Highly recommended, if not for Saffron Burrows and the (((INVERTED))) jokes alone.",1508803200,,620,5.19

7890114,4,6305475695,"Wing Commander is a film that I didn't appreciate at the time but do now.  All I saw at the time were the flaws and boy does this film have some flaws.  There's what is essentially WWII combat in space.  The love story is an annoying distraction.  The Kilrathi are horribly realized.  The script has some of the corniest lines you'll ever hear.

So of course it stinks, right?

I thought that until I realized I would watch it if I caught it on TV.  Then it began to dawn on me, it's a fun film.  Sure there are gaps in science and  in plot.  However if you can just relax and realize it's a 50's sci-fi film in 1999, you're in for a good time.  The effects hold up well since they used models and not CGI which dates quickly.  The action is easy to follow and understand.  Meanwhile the plot is simple and direct.

If you're just looking to be entertained, this film is a good choice.",1495756800,,885,4.153846153846154

7890116,2,6305475695,"The plot structure of this movie is incredibly predictable when you're not trying to determine the structure from the poorly conveyed background information. The space battles are lackluster and the only interesting combat happens with ground troops. Two rather Gary Sue leads handle most of the important stuff, leaving the supporting cast very little to do. Overall, a rather boring watch.",1488240000,,391,5.426229508196721
