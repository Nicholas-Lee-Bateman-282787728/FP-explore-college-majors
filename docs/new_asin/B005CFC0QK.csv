4652739,5,B005CFC0QK,"This is a fun and comical movie to watch for young and old and in between. The sons of Mistletoe are boys in a boys home. The guy who runs Mistletoe has been dependent financially on a guy who is now gone and his daughter decides to sell the home and then realizes she made a mistake but is unable to save the home for the boy's. She herself lived there prior to her parents divorcing when living there at a young age before it became a boys home. The father kept the home and turned it into a boys home, in which the guy who runs the home now had once lived there himself. Now a new mischievious boy is brought to the home, whom they can't find the father of and when they find the father they find out then who the real father is. There are a lot of twists in the movie. Watch the movie and see what happens, it has a happy ending.",1323993600,2,833,3.9642857142857144

4652744,5,B005CFC0QK,"I loved this movie the first time I saw it.  I make sure to DVR it every year.  The premise is a simple one, a wealthy man owns a property that is being used as an orphanage.  When he dies, his daughter inherits the run-down home and it seems that she is bent on tearing down the place and building something new there.  Roma Downey plays the no-nonsense daughter and does an excellent job.  Just when it seems all is lost, a Christmas miracle happens and all is saved.  This is the kind of movie that parents or grandparents can share with the younger family members without worrying about improper dialog or murder and mayhem.  This is a movie for the entire family to enjoy for many years to come.  I recommend this film to anyone who wants to share family values.,",1319932800,31,768,4.359154929577465

4652752,4,B005CFC0QK,"Its anything but a Merry Christmas for the few boys living in a rundown foster home cared for by a former resident of the place (George Newbern as Jimmy Adams).  Their one and only benefactor has just died and instead of continuing with her fathers benevolence, cold hearted Helen Radke (Roma Downey) decides to do just the opposite and sells the place out from under them, leaving them homeless.  When Jimmy tries to ingratiate himself on the cold and unsympathetic businesswoman, he finds that it isn't as easy as he thinks it should be to inspire her to do the right thing.  Her favorite word is NO!  Meanwhile, the hot water heater is in need of repair or replacement and they are given another boy to care for (Scott Terra as Wylie).  And this kid is a handful!  How will Jimmy feed the boys and keep a roof over their heads?

The wonderful Doris Roberts is on hand as the sheriff.  Cathy Lee Crosby plays Helen Radkes longsuffering secretary.  The boys are adorable.  George Newbern plays Jimmy like a big kid who never grew up.  The only sour note in this production is Roma Downey, who plays Helen Radke with such complete indifference that its impossible to see her care about anything, even when she claims to care.  Shes a blank check.  Vacant.  With only one detectable expression........which is one of complete indifference.

Still, theres enough joy generated by the others to make this a holiday movie worth watching more than once.",1450224000,,1448,4.690476190476191

4652780,4,B005CFC0QK,"Roma Downey, Jr. was so brilliant as Iron Man tha- what? What?! Uh, okay, let me have a do-over... Roma Downey was so good in that television show on CBS that I was gutted when it was cancelled. So whenever I got a chance to catch up with her screen work I rarely pass up on it. She stars in The Sons of Mistletoe (2001).

Sensible businesswoman Helen Radke (Roma Downey) was supposed to be in the town of Mistletoe for only a few months, time enough for her to assess and settle her father's corporate assets. She didn't want to know anyone or feel an obligation to anyone. She never saw Jimmy Adams (George Newbern) coming or the nagging imposition he embodies.

Jimmy Adams is the director of the Mistletoe Home for Boys. This foster home is a shabby establishment, maybe too tattered to house these boys taken in from as many as five counties. This foster home was founded thirty years ago, in part thanks to the benevolence of Ms. Radke's late father. This movie opens during the holiday season, which is traditionally when Ms. Radke's father would have given a sizable monetary pledge. With him gone, Jimmy turns to the daughter for a measure of largesse. But she's unimpressed, is unmoved by his plea. She sizes up his rumpled wardrobe and likens his look to that of a pizza delivery boy. More, she tells him it's not sound business practice to depend on one sole benefactor. Jimmy counters with: ""You come from a long tradition of blatant generosity.""

And yet Helen has a point. Jimmy had always leaned heavily on old Mr. Radke's donations to tide the foster home over. But Jimmy's cheerful persistence has this erosive effect on Helen; it eventually wears down her resistance. I described Helen Radke as a ""sensible businesswoman,"" not a cold-hearted one. What Helen hasn't told Jimmy or anyone else in Mistletoe is that she's just sold the entirety of her father's business empire to a group of New York investors. There go the Radke Department Store, there go the Mistletoe Home for Boys.

3.5 out of 5 stars. Add The Sons of Mistletoe to that pile of watchable holiday films. It's for the entire family. There's nothing offensive about it, other than that we're supposed to buy Doris Roberts as the town sheriff. I remember George Newbern primarily from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-of-the-Bride-1-2/dp/B00386EZKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father of the Bride 1 & 2</a>&nbsp;films. Here, he gets to show more of a personality.

But I came here to eyeball Roma Downey who in this film is, for whatever reason (a reason that works), a blonde. I think it's neat that, here and there, she slips up on her American accent and a bit of the Irish comes out. If the script had intended her character to be this calculating, mercenary creature, Downey failed miserably. As usual, she keeps it low key. The sense I get from how she plays her role is that Helen Radke is guarded and conflicted rather than mean-spirited. As we learn in time, part of the conflict roots from her separation from her father. It's what truly imperils the foster home. But, in true keeping with the holiday spirit, there isn't an obstacle too insurmountable, no catastrophic child beyond salvaging (and, yes, some of the foster kids are a handful), no hardened heart beyond thawing. And what's this? A Christmas miracle staged in the final act of a holiday movie? Why, it's as if Jimmy Adams, at the end of his rope, was - sorry, I have to say it - touched by an angel.",1387670400,2,3508,4.801324503311259

I enjoyed the ""homey"" feel, and it was nice to see a movie where people still care for one another more than material things. So many modern Christmas features are too much about the material side of the holidays. Some call it corny in places, but I didn't notice. Maybe I am more forgiving. Picking out an evening movie is more than subject matter to me. What kind of mood am I in? Chances are if I am in the mood for a family film, I will more than likely choose one that makes me feel comfortable and connected. If I take on a heavy dramatic feature, I am probably going to be more critical of how the story plays out. This one was comfortable.
