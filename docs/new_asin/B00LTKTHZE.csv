6505008,5,B00LTKTHZE,"Possibly our greatest living director - always pushing the envelope with creative genius and superb cinematography. At his age, most have futile offerings left(Woody Allen excepted)
Who but Polanski could take on this controversial subject matter so brilliantly.",1413849600,,262,5.921052631578948
6505009,5,B00LTKTHZE,"Awesome.  This reminds me of a perfect bookend to Knife in the Water...another minimalist film of Polankski's, one of his earliest, and still one of his best. This is Emmanuelle Seigner's best role to date.  I found this to be a superior film to Bitter Moon, which is also fun and deals with similar issues.

This movie is both ""light"" and deep at the same time as there is plenty to pick apart and analyze when you get done, yet it's fairly humorous and fun on the surface.

SPOILER:

 Though the film doesn't come out and say it, it seems to me the couple in the film must be married or engaged and this was all an elaborate fantasy..or was it? It is an ambiguous ending, but I get the feeling it's a love story about reinvention.  Reinvention keeps their love exciting and new.  The main actor certainly looks like Polanski too...",1413763200,2,833,4.434210526315789

6505012,5,B00LTKTHZE,"I'm a huge fan of the genre and Polanski so this film was total candy for me. It was done well...but that's pretty much a given. One of the sexiest films to come out on the subject matter of S&M in many years. I went back and watched Bitter Moon after streaming this Emmanuelle Seigner has really evolved as a actress, and always the temptress. The perfect Femme Fatale and everything you would ever want in a mistress. This film was intellectual BDSM candy.",1412035200,15,458,4.464285714285714

6505034,3,B00LTKTHZE,"Based on a play by David Ives and set in a seedy theater, VENUS IN FUR is a two-hander wherein a director (Mathieu Amalric) auditions a two-bit actor (Emmanuelle Seigner) for a role in his stage adaptation of VENUS IN FURS, an 1870 novel by the Austrian author Leopold von Sacher-Masoch.  From this work the term ""masochism"" became commonplace.

Director Roman Polanski's use of a single set allows him to focus closely on the relationship between the protagonists.  As the film begins, it seems that the director enjoys a hold over the actor; he not only has the power to dictate whether she is suitable for the role or not, but claims the privilege of masculinity as being stereotypically the ""strongest"" sex.

As the action unfolds, however, so the roles begin to change.  This is achieved through a clever manipulation of dialogue between the characters.  Sometimes they appear to be reading the adaptation out loud; on other occasions they simply talk to one another.  Initially it seems as if Polanski is keen to separate the two (distinguishing ""fiction"" from ""reality,"" so to speak), but as the film advances we find it more and more difficult to distinguish between them.

Likewise the concept of role-playing becomes difficult to work out, as the two characters exchange roles - the director taking the female lead, the actress playing the male in the adaptation.  This move gives both of them the chance to explore the concepts of ""masculinity"" and ""femininity"" and how they are socially constructed and/or (de-)constructed.

In an ending of almost Gothic proportions, the actress emerges triumphant while the director ends up being discomfited, proving beyond doubt how gender roles can be readily challenged, or even subverted.

While Polanski's concerns are undoubtedly significant, our appreciation of them is tempered somewhat by the nagging sense that, as a male director, he is reinforcing rather than challenging gender concerns.  This is especially evident in the way his camera lovingly pans over Seigner's semi-naked body - her legs, arms and full breasts.  She ends up being objectified even while trying to challenge the director's patriarchal authority.

Nonetheless VENUS IN FUR remains compelling, as well as intense viewing - a testament to what can be achieved on a limited budget and a simple setting.",1457827200,,2331,5.132275132275132

6505038,3,B00LTKTHZE,"A good lady friend of mine suggested I see this movie, so I ordered it.
It's just okay, it is a very slow moving movie AND it is subtitled, which makes it harder to pay attention to the nuances between the 2 actors.
The latter is actually very intriguing, the two actors have a very good grasp on how a Femdom dynamic usually plays out, especially in the beginning.
If you are looking for ""hot"" scenes, you will be disappointed though, it is all about the acting, which these two do very well.
Because it moves so slow, especially in the beginning, I found myself skipping to the next scene with my remote.",1425859200,,606,4.371681415929204

Emmanuelle Seigner played down her good looks and her switch from a flighty and insecure and earthy woman in the beginning to a true goddess in the end was a pleasure to witness. Mathieu Amalric as her foil was perfect. Highly recommended.",1422403200,,388,4.720588235294118

6505043,5,B00LTKTHZE,I have seen the play twice on Broadway. It was terrific. I have now seen the movie three times.  The movie is incredible. You get far more from the story because of close ups and sound. You can see expressions and body movements and hear nuances in the actors voices you cannot get in the play. It gives far more depth to the entire experience. The actors did a superb job. Kudos to Roman Polanski for terrific direction.,1419724800,3,421,4.397435897435898
6505044,3,B00LTKTHZE,"I was disappointed. The movie takes place inside an empty theater and features exactly two actors. The female lead teases out the mental hang-up of the male lead in a predictable, pop-psychology fashion. I did not obtain much titillation or inspiration from this.",1419638400,,263,5.1395348837209305

6505046,4,B00LTKTHZE,"This is a film adaptation of the David Ives 2010 stage play, which in turn was based on the 1870 novel by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch.

This is a specialty interest French language movie (English subtitles).

What is it about? The director of a stage play is conducting auditions: he laments the lack of a suitable leading lady, as he prepares to go home for the day. Into the theater walks an actor who is late for her audition....

The focus is on the interaction between the actor and the director, in real life as well as playing the characters in the play as part of the audition. Their interactions are intense and fascinating. There are undercurrents of sexual tension, power and control.

Making a film with two actors and one set for the entire 96 minutes is a challenge. Roman Polanski and his cast achieve this successfully- delivering a compelling tale with engaging performances, as the characters challenge each other.

Note: this film is not for everyone- it is in French with subtitles, and the focus is on the dialogue between the two actors.

For those who enjoy this genre, and/or the works of Mr Polanski, it is rewarding.",1418601600,4,1140,4.703517587939698

6505050,5,B00LTKTHZE,"This is from veteran director Roman Polanski and is rather a simple story. We meet Thomas (Mathieu Amalric - `The Grand Budapest Hotel' and `Quantum of Solace') who is putting on an adaptation of a play about sado masochism in its highest arty form. He can't cast the main character and has given up for the day as all the wannabe's are useless.

Then in walks Vanda played by the superb Emmanuelle Seigner; she at first comes across as a bit inept and unprepared. But slowly she reveals more and more depth to herself and the character she is to play.

She convinces him to read for her and they start going through the play analyzing all of the nuances - especially the sexual connotations. Then fiction starts to blur with reality as they both immerse themselves in their characters.

This is like a stage play and indeed has been adapted from one - there are only the two characters and the whole thing takes place inside the theater. However, it is absolutely engrossing both actors put in mesmerizing performances and the sexual tension is palpable throughout as is the intrigue. In French with very good subtitles this is an absolute gem which I can wholeheartedly recommend.",1417910400,2,1182,4.700483091787439

6505052,5,B00LTKTHZE,this is an intelligent comedy/drama.  it is well acted by the 2 leads and we feel like we are watching a broadway play. it is well worth watching over again to see how the tables turn between the director and the would be lead actress.,1417392000,,235,4.222222222222222

6505064,2,B00LTKTHZE,"This got such great reviews, that I was eager to watch it.  I generally like Polanski's movies, but this one bored me to tears.  Much is made of the ""transformation"" of the actress, but I thought she was, essentially, the same at the beginning and end of the movie.  She was way too strident and arch, and I found it difficult to identify -- or even watch -- either of the main characters.  The play was acted with a little humor, which made the transformation and eventually power shifts more thrilling.  The movie, though, lacked any sense of wonder or humor.",1416355200,4,561,4.514851485148514

6505069,5,B00LTKTHZE,"So much fun. An intellectual, erotic game of words and role playing, a play within a play, and highly 'meta'!  Is it about power dynamics between men and women; directors and actors; Artist and Muse? Who's really calling the shots - the Lover or the Beloved?  At one point, the Vanda character (the modern-day actress, not the 19th-century play character!)  tells Thomas, our writer-director, that the more his play's character Severin submits, the more he controls Vanda, his mistress-dominatrix, and that it feels the same between them as actress and director. This takes place right before another hard left turn and Vanda takes control. I can see how this play would have been an unbearable and boring exercise in gender theory if not for Seigner and Amalric. Their performances are incredible -- light handed, natural and off-the-cuff. And of course, Polanski's direction keeps things witty and intelligent without wearing either too proudly or seriously. Fun, fun, fun. Okay, the kind of fun without car chases, but there is definitely some cat-and-mouse chasing going on here. The cat and the mouse just keep changing places, until... You'll just have to watch it to see where it ends!",1414713600,3,1192,5.071428571428571

I am not a lover of Polanski's work, but this film is based on a successful Broadway play by American David Ives.  Polanski, exiled in Paris, has turned it into a gem of a French play.  Only two characters interact in a setting that appears to be an audition for a new play by a character named Kushemski.  A woman shows up late in the day, to try out for the leading role.  As they interact, the viewer must decide if the woman is a street waif, a hooker, a starring actress in disguise, or a goddess.  The woman is played by Polanski's real-life wife, and Mathieu Amalric, who plays the writer-director Kushemski, is a clone of Roman Polanski as a younger man. Brilliant, comedic, profound at times.  Almost a meditation on the art of acting.  Or simply of being.",1486166400,,899,4.272189349112426
8667941,4,B00LTKTHZE,"Venus in Fur is a Polanski-directed  two-hander of a film, based on a Broadway play of the same name, adapted itself from the 1870 novella Venus in Furs by the Austrian, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch,all about sexual dominance and submission, based on his own experiences. It is a battle between sexual pleasure derived from pain, and sexual pleasure from inflicting pain. The play-within-a-film is set within a suitably empty theatre set, with modulated lighting and dolly shots. Mathieu Amalric plays the Polanski-look-a-like director/adaptor, who has been auditioning actresses all day long, complaining of the disastrous women(half looked like hookers, half looked like dykes) to his girlfriend on the phone. He says he could do a better job himself if he put on a dress and high heels. Unseen by Thomas, a woman enters the auditorium, apologising for being late. She introduces herself as Vanda(Emmanuelle Seigner), the same name as the character in the play. Thomas cant find her name on the schedule. Hes disgusted by her ignorance, coarseness, gum-chewing, questioning persona. Enticing in bondage kit.  She thinks the book is "" S& M porno"". He thinks it's a bit more sophisticated(and deeply personal).

Yet hes captivated by her: she has a copy of the play, knows all the lines. Through flattery and firmness she ends up on stage doing the audition.. She has somehow changed into a period dress(pulled out of her bag). After initial hostility,he slowly falls under her spell. He finds himself reading the role of the main protagonist,Severin. She transforms herself into a quite seductive lady of manners. There is an ebb and flow of dominance and submission. By the end of their version of the play,he is wearing high heels and lipstick and has been tied by her to a stage prop. What is magical is Polanskis ability to tap sources of his menacing back-catalogue, Cul-de-Sac, The Tenant, The Fearless Vampire Killers, Rosemarys Baby, Tess, Bitter Moon and The Ninth Gate. There is always a hint of the occult, and her satanic seductress. Theres such a relish between the two actors and Polanskis own part in The Tenant,that youd be hard put not to enjoy this,especially with music playing up the sinister. There is a mad carnival, fairground atmosphere, as she becomes the incarnation of a Greek goddess in the power of demonic dance. Some kind of revenge is exacted on males who dares comment on the power of woman kind. Enjoy Polanskis fresh  wind .The stage is et for a sexy, sensual and funny dance of attraction, a gender-driven power play with Vanda in charge.",1483920000,,2572,4.988344988344989
