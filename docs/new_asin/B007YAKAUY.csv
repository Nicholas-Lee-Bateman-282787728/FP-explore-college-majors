8523155,5,B007YAKAUY,"This is a wonderfully performed, imaginatively designed production. Gluck is a gateway drug to better operas, and the libretto is deep. The production embeds the orchestra within the action, and projections on the scrim (as well as the use of lighting and lasers) accentuate the sense of being in the underworld.

I just don't get the price. As I write this, the price is $80+? When I bought it from Amazon in April 2014 it was $36.",1420243200,,432,4.6103896103896105
8523156,3,B007YAKAUY,"I probably should admit that my preference for this opera is the version that Gluck wrote for France He was required to rewrite the role of Orfeo (Orphee) for a male voice. Gluck also wrote more additional music which is frequently co-opted for revivals of the opera under discussion. Of the two French versions I have, the one with Roberto Alagna is a travesty; the only real virtue in this set is the authenticity of the tenor's French.

The best aspect of this new set is the Orquesta bandArt. I do not required historical authenticity but in this case it remains the only virtue of the taping. Why the young Georgian singer was chosen is a mystery. Elsewhere you will find criticism of her costume--it is strange, but if she had the ability to deliver vocally I could have forgiven all else. Additionally La Fura dels Baus, a questionable choice, cluttering  up the visual aspect. They added a great deal to the Valencia Ring, but their presence in this set is gratuitous.

Great Gluck singing reamains a mystery to most singers. This is not surprising in view of the fact that if a company decides to mount a Gluck revival, Orfeo is usually the choice. In Europe this is not necessarily the case, but there is no doubt that Orfeo remains the earliest opera in what can be called the active repertoire. The greatest benchmark for Gluck singing is the great lament, Che faro. Vocally it doesn't pose extraordinary challenges, but interpretively it is a minefield. On CD there are two very good interpretation of this aria, both from complete sets: Horne and Verrett. The greatest, however, is the Callas version, in French and first issued in her first French LP. The voice is hardly pristine, but no where else will you find the combination of passion and pathos. Callas intuitively knew what was required of her and she delivers with passion and fire but never stepping over the musical line. Her sense of devastation and regret are palpable--it's all there with a voice that is willed to convey great tragedy. Alas Rachvelishvili hasn't a clue, but then given her limited experiance why would she? The politics of casting remains a mystery. She was chosen to open La Scala several years ago, with Jonas Kaufmnn, her Don Jose. I have not availed myself of clips on YouTube since I remain partial to Antonnaci (on DVD) and Michel (CD). John Elliot Gardiner has spent considerable time with Gluck; generally his tempos are on the fast side and the voices he has chosen are not large. This is one of the few times I have opted for Solti over Gardiner.  No countertenors please. The field for a genuine Orfeo ed Euridice on DVD remains wide open.",1375833600,4,2647,4.698275862068965
8523157,3,B007YAKAUY,"There is much good to write about the production: the singing and orchestration were very good. However, the costume of Orfeo was far too feminine. You had to force yourself to think of Orfeo as a man. Anita Rachvelishvili is a very voluptuous woman and her dress revieled so much of her breats that you could not think of her as a man. I felt this was very distracting in trying feel the intent of the story.

What I recommend is that anyone wanting a traditional production with great singing, acting, and staging is to consider the Glydebourne DVD with Janet Baker as Orfeo.",1374624000,4,577,4.548076923076923
8523158,5,B007YAKAUY,"Although it still retains some of the mannerisms of opera seria, Orfeo ed Euridice was the first of Gluck's reformist works that would gradually see the elimination of the harpsichord, ballet music, mechanical stage effects, recitativo secco, extravagant aria da capo singing or indeed any decorative effects that didn't serve the progression and meaning of the drama alone.  It would seem inappropriate then to engage a production team like La Fura dels Baus to direct a work as intimate and intentionally stripped-back to basics as this, a work that only has three principal roles (with the majority of it sung by only one person), and to stage it as extravagantly, colourfully and spectacularly as it's done here.  Projections, computer generated lighting effects, performers swinging and singing from cables, with every modern technological tool employed, the ample outdoor stage of the Castell de Peralada filled not only with chorus and supernumeraries, but even the orchestra are up there as well.  This surely wasn't what Gluck intended.

Well, that depends on whether what is up there on the stage enhances the work or detracts from it, and while Carlus Padrissa does go a little overboard on special effects - he's rather over-fond of hanging singers above the stage from cables for my liking - it seems to me (as someone who holds this work in its varied incarnations in very high regard as one of the greatest works in all of opera) that everything works nonetheless in perfect accord with the music, the singing and the dramatic intent of the original work.  There's no reason why spectacle and dramatic purpose can't co-exist and, despite the high-tech tools employed and the wow factor of the staging, the director's intention appears to strive for simplicity of expression, adding nothing that can't be derived from the work itself.  Much like Gluck did when composing the work 250 years ago, La Fura dels Baus' production represents the same kind of modernisation of stuffy theatricality and musical academicism that the composer was reacting against, showing that opera is capable of being the most invigorating of theatrical experiences.

Whether Gluck's score really needs all this spectacle, or whether it isn't more than capable of being perfectly expressive in purely musical and more traditional dramatic terms, is of course debatable.  I'd be less inclined to look favourably on this production if the spectacle detracted from the musical and singing performances, or if it was weak in those areas, but fortunately this is a superb account of the original 1762 Vienna version of Orfeo ed Euridice.  It's perhaps not ideal of course to have the conductor Gordon Nikoli wandering about on the stage, leading as the first violin, and there are some minor lapses in timing when the singers don't have visual contact with the pit, but there is dramatic justification in the Orpheus myth for putting music at the centre of the drama as well as a kind of adherence to Gluck's reformist views on the purpose of opera.  Considering the challenges then, the singers perform admirably.  Anita Rachvelishvili carries the burden of the work as Orpheus well, correctly focussing on the delivery of the singing here - which isn't always easy - and letting the score and the staging carry the dramatic intent and nuance.  Maite Alberola is a powerful Eurydice, working well with Rachvelishvili dramatically and musically in their combination of voices.  Auxiliadora Toledano has a wonderful brightness of tone that serves well in her role as Cupid and messenger from the Gods.

Created to make a big overall impression on a theatrical audience, the spectacle presents some difficulties for the video director Tiziano Mancini, who is forced to resort to use some extreme angle post-production on-stage shots, editing effects and cross-cutting, but by and large, it gets the full impact and the dynamism of the stage production across well on this Blu-ray release.  The HD video transfer is superb - colourful and pinpoint clear, with good sound reproduction in PCM stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  The BD is all-region playable, with subtitles in Italian, German, English, French, Spanish, Chinese and Korean.",1350000000,12,4221,5.131195335276968
