8678743,5,B00NJXXTM6,"Some reviewers have reviewed the movie with good points. I will only add some of my thoughts.

A very well respected military colonel, living a happy life with his wife, suddenly got attracted with the wife of his captain who was just transferred to his camp. While his wife was a delightful person, loved by the other soldiers' wives, mingle to society, she lost her charm to the new woman. The captain's wife was a mysterious person, didn't talk that much, love have bird pets, and also a good wife to her husband.

And then they had an affair. Some sex scenes and nudity. The scenes were very artistic, and passionate between the lovers.

The overall tone in the movie was calm. Sometimes war and battle scenes (in Vietnam), sometime men fighting, some tension, some girls' talk in salon.

What I love most in the movie was the acting of Song Seung-heon as Colonel Kim Jin-pyeong. His acting was very good. Especially as a troubled man, with mental wounds. He found his life when he met Jong Ga-heun, played by Lim Ji-yeon. He expressed his joy, his obsession, his love, his anger, and later his frustration when we was transferred to another assignment.

It's a really good movie and I love watching it many times.

Didn't realize at first this special Korea edition (2 discs) is out of stock, but i found one in COEX Mall Seoul. Apart from the first movie disc, it has all commentaries & behind the scenes on disc 2. It also has so many deleted scenes.

On the sleeve notes, there is an autograph. It looks real, not printed. Since i don't speak Korean, i have no idea whose signature is this. Is it the director, or who? Anyone have info?",1426204800,,1644,4.533783783783784
8678744,3,B00NJXXTM6,"A 2014 South Korean movie Obsessed (In-gan-jung-dok) is about a romance, and a very erotic one. Set in 1969, the film follows the story of the war hero Colonel Kim Jin-pyong (Seung-heon Song). He has come back from Vietnam and is still suffering from the traumatic experiences there. And the life in the military base with his wife Lee Sook-jin (Yeo-Jeong Jo) does not make him a happy man.

One night the Colonel meets a beautiful woman, who happens to be the wife of Captain Kyung Woo-jin (Ju-wan On). And the young captain, who idolizes the colonel, is not treating his wife right.

Obsessed is basically a romantic tale of a forbidden love, but it attempts to do something more. The period drama has also a few things to say about the small community it describes, and the rules that are not written in the book. There is a social hierarchy here, and the people, whether men or women, vie for the status, except a few including the main characters.

The plot is unabashedly melodramatic, but the acting is very good, and the great chemistry between the leads makes this film something special, especially for the fans of Seung-heon Song.",1425427200,,1141,4.695
8678745,5,B00NJXXTM6,"The overall plot of the movie is quite good. SSH plays a soldier w/ PTSD, and quickly becomes obsessed with another man's wife.  He shows many emotions, such as jealousy, vulnerability, and his euphoria once with her, as well as panic and remorse when he is rejected. He would do anything to be with her, and his life is not worth living if he can't be by her side. The more you watch, the more you pick up the subtle emotional changes from one to another. He is not without his faults, however, and is able to manipulate situations so her husband is sent away, giving him time to be alone with her. This is my favorite movie of SSH's and am anticipating his Chinese movie A Third Kind of Love, as well as his currently filming Wonderful Nightmare.",1419724800,,748,4.381294964028777
8678746,5,B00NJXXTM6,What can you say about this movie.  It's hot.  I literately  screamed at the unexpected plot twist and cried my eyes out.  Good film,1418860800,,132,4.375
