4264343,5,B00465I1BA,No one is forcing you cheapskates to buy this. If I or anyone else wants to pay the price what difference does it make to you?,1291507200,7,126,3.8846153846153846
4264344,1,B00465I1BA,"I wholeheartedly concur with the previous reviewers.  I waited patiently, and bought Seasons one through four one at a time - and there is no way I am buying them all again to get Season 5.  I want it.  If/when it is released separately I will cheerfully buy it.  But I will not reward blatant duplicity!",1291334400,20,304,4.375
4264345,1,B00465I1BA,"Like other reviewers, I will not buy a complete set--especially since I have purchased all the ""complete"" season sets up to this point. If this means I will miss out on the final season....so be it. I grew up watching the show, and would be happy to purchase the season I don't have, but I will not repurchase the sets that I already own in order to get the rest of the series. If enough people gripe about it, maybe they'll change their minds--ala Mary Tyler Moore Show ""complete"" vs. final season sets.",1290988800,30,504,4.43010752688172
4264346,1,B00465I1BA,"Like many other, previous reviewers, I have been diligent in purchasing the individual, stand-alone seasons of the show.  To discover, just today, that the producers are releasing a complete box set -- without a separate release of the elusive Season 5 -- is wrong.  I will keep an eye out for this to eventually occur.  However, I will not be one to pay again for items already owned.  I will not pay $100.00 simply to avail myself of Season 5.

I share in the thoughts of those who have requested boycotting this item.",1290816000,20,520,4.548387096774194
4264347,1,B00465I1BA,"Who can we write to to protest the lack of a season five stand alone set ?
This is either very sloppy merchandising or a blatent attempt to gouge the very people who support releasing classic animation.

I faithfully bought each season when they came out  in spite of the long wait between season three and four  and the release of incomplete sets
as ""Best of"".
As much as I like Rocky And Bullwinkle
I for one will not pay twice for the same material.",1290729600,25,452,4.294117647058823
4264348,1,B00465I1BA,"I agree with above reviews. Release season 5 as a stand-alone. I own the 4 others and will never buy this release as that would be stupid, even Bullwinkle isn't that stupid.",1290211200,20,173,4.4375
4264349,4,B00465I1BA,"I'd complained earlier about this set being the epitome' of manufacturer greed by not offering Season 5 as a stand-alone release.  That has been rectified!!!

The Amazon listing for Season 5 is here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-Bullwinkle-Friends-Complete-5th-Season/dp/B004ITYDT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends: Complete 5th Season</a>

If you do not own *any* R&B this set *may* be the one to get as it includes all 5 seasons plus a few ""bonus"" items: A Gold Ribbon, Frostbit Falls Field Guide, and an Episode Guide.  BUT, the disks for Seasons 1-4 are the same as in previous sets.  This means we still have musical changes on the opening/closing passed off as ""those preferred by Jay Ward"", the ""bugs"" on the video, and double-sided disks for Season 2.  In addition you'll get lousy packaging consisting of disks in cardboard sleeves guaranteed to scratch your disks.

**Update**

Reports indicate this release now has individual seasons in standard amaray cases with pages for the disks.  That removes my sole complaint about this release so it's now a matter of watching for which has the better price.

**End Update**

If you don't care about the ""bonus"" items you may want to pick up the individual seasons when on sale just for the better packaging they offer.

Because I own the other 4 seasons separately I'll pick up the stand-alone release of S5.  While it would be nice to have the Field and Episode Guides it's not worth a double-dip.

However, the title of the package is correct it contains 100% complete ""Bull..."" :)",1289001600,266,1612,5.2952755905511815
4264350,1,B00465I1BA,"I already have the first three seasons of the series and got each of them for less than $20 each for them. Season Four is available separately for less than $20.  I'm NOT paying an average of $21 per season for a set where I have three-fifths of the seasons and probably two-thirds of the discs already.  I don't want the Fifth season that badly and I won't be buying the Fourth season separately at this point.

I'm angry about this-and I DON'T get mad about double-dips as a rule.  If the list price was a third lower and the sale price was $60-70, that would be justifiable to me.  Better yet would be TO OFFER SEASON FIVE SEPARATELY!!!!

4264361,2,B00465I1BA,"Hokey Smoke. I wonder if there is anything resembling quality control over the discs this company produces.  Here you have a 5 star series, complete with extras, and a 1 star disc quality.  For example, the  4 Season One discs I received have 3 bad ones: scratches visible, smudges visible and one disc that looks like it has the letter z inscribed on the playing surface.  That is totally unacceptable.  Because Seasons Two, Three and Four had flawless discs (Season 5 has a pin hole on one of the discs), I am keeping the set but repurchasing Season One separately, hoping the next attempt will get it right. (Note: I received it today and close inspection of the four discs shows no flaws. Who can explain all of this?  Rocky/Bullwinkle/Friends is a magnificent show and will certainly survive many more generations.

Yes, there seemshould to be several music cues that probably should have been included but, it doesn't detract from the spirit of the episodes. Also, they are not always totally correct in the order, as someone else mentioned Dudley Doright appearing a bit early. With that said, there also seems to be good reasons for these things happening when someone in the studio explains, sometimes original cues have been lost ect....the cartoons themselves are still a blast. The picture quality is fantastic as well considering Jay Wards huge budgets and attention to detail  (huh?). This is the best and I couldn't ask for more as I watch these about every day.
Now, if I could just get a clean Hoppity Hooper collection...",1443225600,,958,4.569767441860465

4264375,4,B00465I1BA,"I always loved Rocky & Bullwinkle when I was a kid. Even then I was able to appreciate the sharp, witty writing, the tongue-in-cheek, topical humor and the ridiculously intricate plot lines. The ONLY reason I don't give it five stars is because the opening and closing theme music is different from the original broadcast and, oddly, this seems to detract from the joy of glancing over my shoulder at this particular element of my childhood. However, despite my anal-retentive purism, I have to say that this collection is one of the best investments I've made for my DVD library. Every episode is here and, apparently, they've improved the packaging others here have complained about (there are NO cardboard sleeves). Each of the five seasons is contained in its own multi-disc case, and the collection comes with a printed manual outlining the history of Rocky, Bullwinkle, Boris and Natasha, supporting characters, profiles of Mastermind Producers Jay Ward and Bill Scott and a myriad of other information you don't realize you want to know until you read it. If you want to expose your kids to real cartoon comedy (as opposed to laser-eyed anime tykes who can fly and live in outer space and fight fire-breathing squids and such), then this collection would be ideal. Despite its age, the humor is still fresh, the characters are still funny and the episodes are short enough to hold the attention of today's youth while leaving them wanting more (remember: each Rocky & Bullwinkle episode always ends with a cliffhanger). Highly recommended.",1434240000,15,1546,4.996124031007752

4264389,5,B00465I1BA,The Rocky and Bullwinkle show. If you are thinking to yourself great an old kids show you are mistaken this show is great and was listed as the TV Guides 6th greatest cartoon of all time. This show is great with satirical humor with creative and downright ridiculous storylines but that just makes it more fun. Each episode ends in a cliffhanger and you cant wait to see in what ridiculous way Rocky and Bullwinkle will get out of trouble. With great villains and a lot of cultural references of life in the late 50s and early 60s it is a show that both kids and adults can enjoy.,1428364800,,580,4.330275229357798

4264392,5,B00465I1BA,"Last time you remember, we've seen in recent reviews for this whole series set, that it was recently remade with better disc-handling packaging than cardboard sleeves; as disc-holding ""pages"". Also in this set are several physical extras you won't find in any season set on their own, including a tell-all book about Jay Ward and this series' legacy. Aside from the ""circus"" theme music or the originals of most of the other segments, you pretty much get the whole series on an 18-disc DVD set, including the 4 double-sided discs for season 2; all 28 story arcs & 326 Moose-adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, all 91 Fractured Fairy Tales, all 91 Peabody's Improbable History segments, all 38 Dudley Do-Right segments (excluding a 39th one that Wikipedia talks about that ClassicMedia and DreamWorks somehow don't own), all 39 Aesop and Son stories, and all the segments of Bullwinkle's Corner, Mr. Know-it-all, and the Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan Club. All the discs are an all-in-one reissue of all 5 season sets together, right down to the bonus features and small bugs, and a missing short scene from The Treasure of Monte Zoom, and Mucha Loma (Much Mud) and its segments being high-pitched via time compression. Every bit of this series has the wacky wit, satire, and punny humor of Jay Ward and Bill Scott! If you wish to own the whole series of Rocky and Bullwinkle and haven't yet, go ahead and get this 1.5-dozen-disc monster and save some moo-lah and shelf space, even with seasons 1 to 3 being reissued in single DVD cases! You won't be sorry with this real-life Digimon (short for ""Digital Monster"", which is an modern example of Jay Ward's punny humor). Be with us next time for ""George of the Jungle's Golden Age"" or ""George with Tom Slick & Super Chicken, But No 'Magnolias'""!

JAY WARD's irreverent, pun-riddled creation unspooled in cliffhanger episodes urgently narrated by WILLIAM CONRAD, starring sensible ROCKET J. SQUIRREL (JUNE FORAY) and his dimwitted bosom buddy BULLWINKLE J. MOOSE (voiced by head writer BILL SCOTT), who constantly thwarted Potsylvanian no-good-niks BORIS BADENOV (PAUL FREES) and NATASHA FATALE (FORAY again). Hapless Mountie DUDLEY DO-RIGHT, unflappable time traveling canine MR. PEABODY, the moral dispensing AESOP AND SON, and FRACTURED FAIRY TALES proved all too rare examples of supporting players who were as entertaining as the stars. Interspersed with the silly short skits BULWINKLE'S CORNER and MR. KNOW IT ALL, ROCKY & BULLWINKLE stood head and antlers above similarly animated but far less clever fare like UNDERDOG and TENNESSEE TUXEDO...earning a well deserved place in the hearts of kids hooked on its colorful, wacky characters and the heads of adults drawn to its uncompromising, cerebral humor.

4264486,5,B00465I1BA,"I consider myself fortunate to have been born in a generation able to witness these cartoons when they were originally telecast in the 60s and shorty thereafter. The clever humor within the context of Cold War America is of a quality that one simply does not find in such programming today.

Sadly, animated features today are of two extremes:  either sickeningly sweet or simply gross, nearly all of which assumes a virtually brain dead audience that varies only in its level of angst and rebelliousness in terms of what is being indulged by whomever is reponsible for producing such tripe.

Rocky & Bullwinkle - along with associated features such as Professor Peabody, Fractured Fairy Tales, etc. - were animated features with genuine wit, plus a commendable moral message that did not patronize nor take itself too seriously.

A joy to watch and experience for kids of all ages, and for the kid in all of us...that mildly smart-alecky, genuinely curious, and well-meaing kid, that is.",1382054400,8,988,4.96969696969697

Even though the show was a little ""Off The Wall"", I often find these old childhhood favorites more pleasure to watch than a lot of the violence and trash on TV today.

4264489,5,B00465I1BA,"I remember the original airings of Rocky and his Friends and The Bullwinkle Show, and have a pretty good recall regarding this show, as it was always one of my favorites.
 I borrowed the set from a friend and will be buying it for myself very soon.
Let's start with the positives;
 The prints, have been color corrected, are strong, and complete. An enjoyable viewing experience. At first I thought these might be from a broadcast print, but after watching the full set, it becomes obvious that these were meticulously restored master prints. Many of the obvious defects stem from the animation phase, so they are native to the original finished film.
 Audio quality is strong and clean, and all of the interstitial clips are present. Very much a worthwhile purchase for the price.
Now to the shortcomings;
 These are the syndicated format versions of the show, so many of the music beds have been changed out, and the original program openers and closers are not used.
 Purists will note that in addition to these points, the between episode features (Fractured Fairy tales, Mr. Peabody, Aesop, and Dudley Do-Right) do not appear in the original chronological play order.
 Dudley Do-Right was not a regular feature on Rocky and his Friends, which aired on ABC, but was introduced on The Bullwinkle Show as the program was renamed when it was picked up by NBC. This isn't a big deal to me, but it may be to some.
 Bottom Line; we have waited for many years to have the complete series made available to the public, and this is the best offering to date, and well worth the price!
 One glaring music bed change was on a Mr. Know-It-All segment on the topic of High Fidelity, when Bullwinkle plays a tape that has bagpipes on it. It was originally Paul Frees singing a very heavily accented version of Roamin' in The Gloamin' which I always found very funny, to which Bullwinkle identifies the source as a'Scotch Tape'.
There are many small things I could touch on in the negative, but they are outweighed by the sheer enjoyment of binge viewing any one of the many episode series. A great value!
Perhaps one day, when all the legalities get sorted (I believe Disney still holds the rights to the original version and format) where we can get these in a restored form with the features in proper chronological order, on BluRay. That and a little more sophisticated authoring to allow skipping all of the intro and credit slates when you have opted to 'play all' ( I author DVD's for a living, and yes, the disc can be scripted to do this). That and a better storage method for the discs themselves (the cardboard pockets in the set make it difficult to remove the discs safely). But for what is here, order without reservation. This is some of Jay Ward's best work!
 The companion guide is of great value, and the overall layout of the discs is solid.",1377993600,6,2849,4.625742574257425

I highly recommend this complete series as opposed to buying by each individual season. Your kids or grandkids will enjoy this as much as you will.

What child knows of the Ruby Yacht of Omar Khayyam? Or Apple Pandowdy.  Many other references' are over ones head as a child but still just as much fun to watch.

The show follows a simple formula that starts with a series of cliffhangers starring Rocky and Bullwinkle. You are required not to miss any of the installments to keep track of what is going on. Next in the formula, ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" I am afraid that this is where I acquired my classical background. Many of the fairy tales have alternate endings.  The narrator of the tales is Edward Everett Horton (Mr. Witherspoon in ""Arsenic and Old Lace."") then we come to ""Bullwinkle's Poetry Corner"" or ""Mr. Know-it-All"" where he meets with many slapstick situations.  Again, this is where I picked up my poetic background. Then there is the hat trick (wrong hat), ""Peabody's Improbable Histories"", ""Dudley Do-Right"", or ""Aesop's and Son.""  Wrapped all up in 22 minutes with a concluding cliffhanger.

The animation was crude, even when initially aired, but then again, that's not where the charm of R&B lies.  There is some minor discoloration etc. in parts of the video, and  and the audio certainly isn't today's quality, but my suspicion is the manufacturer did its best with whatever masters it had available.

4264539,4,B00465I1BA,"The pluses are definitely being able to see all of the original episodes with R and B in the correct sequence.

Minuses-- I am currently in the middle of the second season and based on my reading and research-- the music themes used for Rocky and Bullwinkle show, Sherman and Peabody, and Fractured Fairy Tales, as well as the intro theme for each Rocky and Bullwinkle episode has been standardized to what I consider in all cases the inferior version.

The Rocky and Bullwinkle theme is especially tedious.  How many times do we have to see Bullwinkle fall into the car and sign his autograph as ""John Smith""?  Along with the itty bitty card ending-- how I long for that extra bright colorful lights marquee . . .

I'm suspecting a real reason may be a casualty of the high costs of securing rights all over again for the DVD set.  With all respect to Sony Bono, that Digital Copyright Millenium Act has caused more headaches with original music omitted and sometimes some shows not appearing AT ALL in DVD format.  And I suspect this is yet another casualty.  It's just cheaper to get the same standardized theme music and they apparently went by Jay Ward's wishes, which ironically contrasts for those like me who grew up watching this show in syndication.

So for those who like the original themes, keep looking out for the syndicated Bullwinkle on your live TV.  As for the series, this is definitely worth a buy otherwise.  It's wonderful to see the rest of it all again.",1348444800,3,1478,4.603053435114504

4264558,4,B00465I1BA,"""Hey, Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat.""
""Again?""
And again and again and again.

Bad animation and worse puns. How can anybody resist?

But why can't people leave things alone? 20 years ago, when Disney released a few Rocky & Bullwinkle adventures on VHS, they cobbled together the individual episodes clumsily and added synthesized music to the Fractured Fairy Tales (replacing the original end title music).

The current set on DVD is a vast improvement. But what's up with the cheap-looking (but admittedly cleverly integrated--even in long shots) ""Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends"" logo which doesn't match the original artwork? They even found a William Conrad impersonator to loop the new title over the original vocal. But why bother?

Oh, well. Whether you buy each season separately--as I did, and you might want to if you're concerned about the packaging of the complete set, which others here have complained about--or the whole shebang here, you won't be disappointed with your purchase. Today's animators could take lessons, particularly the ones who only think they're doing this kind of humor (you'd never guess from the drek being produced). It's the playfulness and lack of malice or snark that give these cartoons their magic--and a loyal fan base for over a half century. Nobody cares about the technical or layout errors (in one famous scene, Bullwinkle, incorrectly registered to the background, enters a room seemingly floating above the floor); in fact, they add to the charm. Quite a change from today's more elaborate but much less graphically sophisticated design and easy let's-just-make-fun-of-everything philosophy--or worse, the sanctimonious didacticism that has crept into anything that smacks of children's entertainment.

And the voices! Unfortunately, today's voice actors lack the radio training that cultivated the greatness of Paul Frees, Hans Conreid, Daws Butler, Bill Scott, and the happily-still-with-us (at this writing) June Foray. They knew how to make the material sound even better than it actually was. Perfection.

Now here's something we hope you'll really like. No, not hope--know.",1322006400,13,2140,5.354166666666667
4264559,4,B00465I1BA,"I've seen a lot of complaints on this page, and after receiving the box set, I gotta say it's pretty damn good.
Will the discs get scratched? yeah, a little bit. And some of them have residue from the packaging - a few little yellow spots.
Will the discs play properly? Absolutely. Don't worry about it unless you're sloppy about sliding them out of the cardboard, or you leave them out without placing them in the packaging or something.

The two complaints that make the most sense to me are
a) the ""R&B"" logo at the bottom-right of the screen is somewhat distracting and totally unnecessary (but it does fade away within a few seconds)

and

b) the multiple intros in each episode are lengthy, annoying, and repetitive. Maybe there's an option for turning them off / skipping them in ""Play All"" mode, but I haven't found it yet.

Other than that, it's a beautiful package design, a fantastic show, and a hell of a value at $50-60.
All in all, I think anyone who takes an interest in this box set is going to be really satisfied with it. It's not perfect, but few things in the world are.

It's fun to watch several episodes in one sitting, which gets you through a good part of a story arc. Some of the stories go for more than 30 episodes (!), and others are much shorter.

Here's what I don't like about the set:
* The opening theme music is not the original. There were lots of variations of the opening music, and they've standardized it for this set.
* The ""Rocky and Bullwinkle and their friends"" branding is grafted into the opening music of each mini episode. Considering that they've done this at all, it's done well. But I'd rather see the original.
* The packaging is pretty lame. Season Two DVDs are double-sided, the rest are not. The cardboard sleeves are hard to get the DVDs in and out of, and don't protect the discs well.

Season 5 is all repeats of the first 4 seasons,and,the only thing new in Season 5 are the Rocky  and Bullwinkle stories.  Aesop And Son,  Fractured Fairy Tales ,Peabody's Improbable History and  Dudley Do Right  as well as Bullwinkle's Corner are  repeated from  Seasons 1 2 3 and 4.

Now,you know the music that opens Aesop And Son and Fractured Fairy Tales? both  have the same music on all 5 Seasons on these DVD sets. What is missing  is the OTHER tune that would open Fractured Fairy Tales  and sadly, it is very much missed.

Does anyone know why that so much better musical tune that opens Fractured Fairy Tales  is not on  any of  the Fractured Fairy Tales  on these  DVD sets?

it must  be a rights thing or something and it sure is a shame  that it is not

on any of these Fractured Fairy Tales contained on these DVD sets.

I  know these  5 seasons on DVD are not the original  versions as they run 22 minutes and several seconds  and its too bad  they could not have  put the full
version episodes on these DVD season sets. Once again, it must have to do with music rights.  Real shame about  all this.

4264592,4,B00465I1BA,"After reading everyone else's comments and reviews before purchasing, I was actually starting to consider not making the purchase at all..
Many people were complaining about ClassicMedia not making a season 5 dvd individually, dvd pockets that will scratch your discs, and boycotting.

Needless to say, I went ahead and purchased the dvd set (it was only $65 when I got it), probably not worth $100, but it was a steal at the price I got it for.

Anyways, I'll break the actual reviewing down into sections for each part of set.

The box:
I was surprised by the quality of the case, especially after reading about what others had to say about ClassicMedia; It's made out of a very thick, dense cardboard with a mix of glossy and matte colors.

Bonus Items:
There are 2 bonus items unless you count their joke about the picture of Jay Ward & Bill Scott.
A well made ribbon with a picture of Bullwinkle, and a Frostbite Falls Field Guide.

The DVD case:
As appealing as it looks, it has one annoying but exaggerated flaw: the DVD pockets.
Annoying because of how inconvenient it is to have to fidget around with the pocket just so you can watch your show.
Exaggerated because of how some people claimed that it was so bad it would cause people to get all their discs scratched; Anyone who has ever worn jeans, gotten stuff out of an envelope, or has done anything similar to the already listed things, could properly get these discs out without scratching them.

I usually turn the page onto its side, pull up on the pocket flap, and the dvd will slide out just enough to be taken out without any rough handling.

The DVD's!:
The resolution is great, and plays crystal clear on a wide-screen LCD tv.
If I were to make any complaints about the DVD's, it would about the discs for season 2, since they're double-sided :(

4/5, the set's great, but season 2 and the pockets are just a hassle.",1294876800,73,1887,4.513196480938417
4264593,4,B00465I1BA,"A lot of people have complained that this product is the exact same as the previously released sets. While they are correct (seasons 1-4 are the exact same discs) they are missing the point entirely. For starters the set takes up so much less space on the shelf. (When I put it where my old season sets were it took up the space of season 1 and a half). This may not seem like a big deal but this is valuable space to most dvd collectors. The set also comes with a cool piece of memorabilia (A button ribbon of Bullwinkle) in a manilla envelope (obviously based on something that was originally given to R&B fans). Along with this piece is a nicely done book (the size of a dvd) that retells the story of Jay Ward and most of the segments for the show. It's a really cool and concise book with some really interesting facts. The packaging is awesome and done with a lot of care. I understand people's frustration with the absence of a Season 5 set, however to have all these dvds in one package is amazing and the price (as it is now) is a great deal. The glaring negative was that they kept the Season 2 discs double sided. They really needed to switch these to a single sided format. the double sided discs seemed to take a beating no matter how careful you are.

Positives:
Unique collectibles
Cool book
Everything R&B in one set
Lots of saved space
The packaging is awesome

Negatives:
No new discs or material (save the unreleased 5th season)
Double sided season 2 discs (Boo!)

Overall I think it's worth it to have everything in one place and to save lots of valuable space on the shelf, not to mention the cool extras included in the set.",1294358400,131,1646,4.337662337662338

4264595,3,B00465I1BA,"I received this set yesterday and,I hate the way they have placed the DVDs!

This is the kind of way none of us like, where the discs just slip into a cardboard pocket. Its tough to try and grab the disc out and also, as is always the case when DVDs are placed this way, there is a lot of scuffs and scratches on the DVDs. And then there is the problem of trying to put the DVD back into the pocket. At the price they are charging for this, you would think they would have perhaps put the single season sets into this box or, used hubs to hold the discs so they would not get scratched and scuffed.

The box itself is nice the way it opens up, and inside is a book titled ""FROSTBITE FALLS FIELD GUIDE"" by Keith Scott. There is a page at the start written by Kimberly Ward. The book has photos and is filled with info on how the show was started and nice interesting stuff. and then there is An episode guide for each DVD of whats on each.

There is also a light yellow envelope with a flaplock and inside is a ribbon award that says on it ""Exceptional adequacy award for helping promote public apathy toward the Bullwinkle show"".On it also is a pin button with Bullwinkle on it.

As to the DVDs again. They are in a book like holder when you open it, to the left are discs 1 and 2 and as I had mentioned, they are hard to get out and to place back in. to the right are discs 3 and 4 and so on as you turn the pages. Each page has arrows with lines so you know what disc has the Rocky Bullwinkle serial that it is talking about.

I am hoping any of you who also has this set can give a more detailed review.

I did watch the first disc and the ""R&B"" logo pops up.

I wish  they could have  used HUBS for the DVDs as the way they are, they will get

scuffed more and more from removing  and placing the discs back. This really  stinks!!!!!!!!",1294272000,133,1840,3.983651226158038

Um... Sorry.  I wouldn't really call that an accurate (or helpful) review.

Then I contacted one of the people that I bought Season 1 and 4 from and they were nice enough to cancel my order with no penalties involved. I also purchased Season 2 from them and they told me that when it arrived to just refuse it and they will credit my account back less shipping and handling (3.00) As for Season 3, when it arrived, I just resold it back on eBay for the same price I paid for it.

I completely understand why people who bought the 4 Seasons were upset but my suggestion is to just sell them on eBay or Amazon and use that money to get this set.
Being a baby boomer, I grew up watching cartoons and Rocky and Bullwinkle was one of my all time favorites (along with Yogi Bear and Crusader Rabbit) Although at the time I didn't appreciate the puns, as I got older, the pure genius of these cartoons became abundantly clear. Fractured Fairy Tales and Aesop's Fables always cracked me up. And although it stretched history, Mr. Peabody was actually very informative.
I am so looking forward to reliving the memories associated with this cartoon and I hope that those who are mad at the distributor will not take it out on the cartoon. You will only be depriving yourself of countless hours of hilarity and fun.",1293753600,14,1626,4.26537216828479
4264600,4,B00465I1BA,"First off, I have purchased Seasons 1-3 (I missed the release of 4.. and haven't rushed to get it yet.

Taking a trip through a time machine...
To 2005... The DVD release of Fraggle Rock Season 1...
2006... The Second Season of Fraggle Rock....
2007..... The Third Season of Fraggle Rock....
2008..... The fourth Season of Fraggle Rock??? Umm NO... The complete Box set of Fragle Rock... No release of the 4th/5th (Final) Season as a stand alone.....
2009.... The final season was released as a stand alone.

Sooo... moral of the story.... They will release the box set... and probably within a year they will release season 5 as a standalone.... They want to go after the people who want box sets... They get the exclusive first crack at season 5...And who knows.. maybe they will screw everyone over and not release season 5 as a stand alone... but give them a fair shake....",1293062400,4,877,4.651612903225806
4264601,5,B00465I1BA,"MOST of the reviews I'm reading here are more or less reviews of the price and/or the distributing company (or manufacturer more specifically)and not the actual product itself.
  If you don't particularly like R&B then give it low ratings,if you hate R&B then give it bad reviews and a low rating. If however you love R&B and remember it with great fondness and still enjoy it as I do(I'm nearly 60 years young) give it 5 stars for content and then in your comments voice your complaints.
  I have patiently waited for each season to be released and purchased them. I bought the ""best of"" sets and now I am buying the complete series because I want it. I am not rich or poor and I will either keep the individual sets as back-up or give them to family members(grandkids,etc.)
 It's sad to see a 2-star rating on this set because of the way it's being merchandised(and yes I do realize that's part of the deal).If you feel very strongly about not buying this-fine with me-but in my opinion this is DEFINITELY 5-star stuff!!
 This is in no way a ""put-down"" of those of you who so strongly object to the double-dipping/holding out of a season 5 stand-alone set,it's just that those are nonissues with me and I will be enjoying these classics for (hopefully) many years to come.
 And also the price is a bit better now,eventhough I ordered it at the $99.00 price. After reviewing this review I kinda think me & Bullwinkle have more in common than I would like to admit--oh well, there are worse things.",1292716800,19,1498,4.525925925925926
4264602,5,B00465I1BA,"This is terrific!  I have to say, I never bought one season of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show as they slowly released them over the last several years!  Frankly, I could take the show or leave it.  It's okay.  They made some good Cheerios commercials before I was born.

I'm glad I waited!  Now I can get all 5 seasons at less than half of what real fans paid, AND unlike them, I'll get Season 5!  I probably won't even watch Season 5.  I'll pop on the first disc of Season 1, watch a few cartoons, and then put it away forever.  But I'll HAVE Season 5 if I want it, and that's the greatest gift that a kinda-sorta-fan of the show could be given by the show's producers!  I feel blessed.  Well, I would if I were a loyal fan.  But if I were a loyal fan, I would have bought the dvds individually, with faith that my collection would be completed eventually.  But I'm not, so ha!

Same thing happened with Seinfeld last year.  Never watched the show, never supported the dvds.  But Amazon put the expensive complete series up for sale one day at around $30, and I snatched it up!  It pays to not give a darn!  Sorry, loyal fans!

The packaging looks nice. Looks like it contains scouring pads.  Is this the cartoon with the bears that steal picnic baskets?  I'll find out soon enough.  Eh, no I won't!  But thanks for the deal!",1292112000,25,1325,4.232931726907631

Distributors do this all the time, yet you people never learn, can't wait, then kick yourselves afterwards. When the complete series comes out next month, other companies are offering it for under $70.00. It's your own fault!

I enjoyed watching with my dad as a child, and I still enjoy watching them just as much with my child. In fact I enjoy it a little more because I can actually understand the more mature jokes sprinkled throughout the show..  this has every season of rocky and bullwinkle and every episode.  some discs are double sided and some disks are single side, not sure why that would be the case.",1512864000,,478,4.420454545454546

The only thing I cannot for the life of me understand is the insane prices being asked for the box set. I have seen it as high as $265.00!!! I mean c'mon folks! That's just plain stupid. It's a classic case of price gouging due to a strange out of stock status. I will wait until it comes back in stock...even at $65, it's a bit pricey,..but much better than what the others are seeking.",1489449600,2,475,4.0638297872340425

The Bullwinkle set harks back to better days, when entertainment was intelligent, not at all like what has happened in this country since about 1992 with mainstream entertainment.  If you are like me, you will find yourself watching this series over and over again.",1487289600,2,434,4.773333333333333
