8685543,5,B00OYUMJ2O,"In the history of the Papacy, the Popes that stand out are either known for their great holiness or their great notoriety. The subject of this feature 'St. Celestine: The Pope who quit' falls into the annals of the former.
Shot on location in Italy, and dramatically re-enacted, this film brings to life the tumultuous times of the latter half of 13th Century whereby the Throne of St. Peter was left vacant for more than 2 years, and needless to say the church was without a head.

If you are interested in history this documentary will not disappoint you. It takes the viewer from the birth of Peter Morrone (who would later become Pope Celestine V), his calling, his works and the events that lead up to his election to the Papacy, and from thereon to his reign, abdication and incarceration. Full of medieval intrigue from the political and ecclesiatical stand point, it goes into great lengths to make the viewer understand the nature of the times and to bring to the forefront an ascetical, pious man who just wanted to be left alone! It also explores his spirituality, the spirituality of an ascetic/hermit in general, and the adherence of Peter Morrone to the Benedictine rule, to which he, as a Benedictine monk, strictly did and to conform more fully to it, founded his own community of monks, a branch of the Benedictine order called the Hermits of San Damiano, a.k.a Murronites, a.k.a. the Celestines (now defunct).

Most interestingly, this film does not end with his death but gives us added information oh his cannonization process and brings us in the 20th Century, when the incorrupt body of this Saint was 'kidnapped'!

As mentioned before this film is shot on location and the audience is taken to all the places that were visited, frequented and was notable during his life, papacy and thereafter. By so doing this it becomes a visual pilgrimage of sorts.

Contributing to the historrical research of this documentary are the following persons:
1. Paolo Golinelli - Historian at the University of Verona and an author of a book in Italian on the same Pope.
2. Fr. Quirino Salomone - Franciscan priest from the Institution of Celestinian Studies.
3. Walter Capezalli - Historian
4. Fabio de Paolis - owner of the Castle of Fumone; the very castle where Pope Celestine V was incarcerated after his abdication by Pope Boniface VIII.

Much more is discussed in this film, however not everything is or can be listed here.

Only one thing was not appreciated and that was the using of the word 'magic' when speaking about the medicines the future saint prepared to heal those who approached him. However this does not negate the excellence of this documentary.

Though this DVD is rich in history, those who have an aversion to the subject should not be dissuaded from purchasing it. It will give them an excellent insight into the difficult times the church faced and will continue to face in its sojourn on earth, and that God will indeed raise up saints in our day to help, support and guide us on the way of salvation as He did Celestine; and so we learn about a saint!

This DVD presentation is in English, with the comments from the experts in Italian which is dubbed in English and is 60 minutes long.
