8728896,5,B013UY2EMO,"Evidently these silent black-and-white films of Kenya in the 1920s (set to an orchestration of ""Carnival of the Animals"") were broadcast on American TV in 1953. That must be how I happened to remember Martin and Osa Johnson (both of whom had died by that time). These are perfectly charming explications of African wildlife and native peoples, with explanatory dialog cards every now and again. They spent four years in what was then British East Africa, and gave us these first nature films. They apparently were big hits in movie houses their time, as were the Johnsons' lectures, which provided the self-funding for more exploration. Martin, in a pit helmet, seems to have done most of the actual film shooting, although his wife was extensively involved in the productions as well. She's a little cutie, in a big flop hat, holding a rifle bigger than she is. There now is a Martin and Osa Johnson Museum in Chanute, Kansas, which sponsors the production of this disc. They have done us a great service.",1445472000,2,1006,4.820809248554913

such a trouper.....it is hard to believe they traveled as they did.  Osa proved why Women are certainly equal to any man.
The old film camera cranked it out....it fine.  Well worth the purchase, just for historical purposes.",1422230400,2,344,5.107142857142857
