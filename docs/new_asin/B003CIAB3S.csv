The parents of both of them are also life long friends ready to help each other when needed. They live in the country and are close.

His sister Chen Su Xin moves to Taipei meets a man who has many issues Lin Ying Joe played by Weber Yang. Their romance is the secondary story. Weber Yang is incredible as a dramatic actor. I love his acting.

The family dynamics and the love and support of community are the reasons I love this story.",1515024000,,659,4.256
