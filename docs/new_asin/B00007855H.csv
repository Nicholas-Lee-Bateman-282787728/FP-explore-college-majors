7974243,5,B00007855H,"This is a pretty good movie where Tony Danza gets to use a fair bit more of his acting talent than he got to do on his household name character roles on Cannonball Run II and the eighties/early nineties sitcom Who's The Boss. The movie has quite a few other actors who are typecast as a character they have played elsewhere so it's great to see them as someone else in a movie, such as Pamela Reed (Arnie's partner in Kindergarten Cop) who plays the wife/mother, Heather Tom (Katie Spencer in Bold & the Beautiful) who plays the daughter.  The basic plot revolves around a teen who never returns from a test drive with the seller of a red pickup truck.  Her parents badger the police who are reluctant to do much since she was 19 and didn't like being controlled by her overprotective father.  But then a body turns up which the parents deny is her.  Saying anything else would spoil this pretty well acted for a likely made for TV movie.  Of all the budget movies you come across for a couple of dollars, this is one of the better ones.

Spoiler may be worked out with this question though but it's something I didn't get.  Why was the corpse naked?",1466985600,,1150,4.370892018779343
7974244,5,B00007855H,"Tony Danza and Pamela Reed are excellent as a couple seemingly in denial of their teenage daughter's murder, while trying to keep their family together. The last half-hour in particular is truly gripping, and terrifying, when their daughter's killer is revealed, Ving Rhames lends able support as the homicide detective who forces the family to confront its deadly secret.",1463011200,2,372,5.322033898305085

7974247,4,B00007855H,"Tony Danza has always played the likeable dude -- a guy next-door type of character. And for most of Deadly Whispers, that's just what he is. There is some foreshadowing that something is amiss, but I was in total denial all the time!

Without spoilers, I can only say that the pay-off toward the end is fabulous. Tony Danza is really a wonderful actor, capable of so much more than sit-coms! Deadly Whispers is a very good film, not to be missed.",1282694400,4,447,4.451219512195122
7974248,4,B00007855H,"I had read the book before the movie & I really like Heather Tom so then I saw that she was in it I wanted this movie. I don't like Tony Danza playing the father. The father was fat & ugly. To me Tony is ""Who's the boss"". There are plenty of actors out there that could have played the father. Tony is a good actor but he's not a evil man. But I loved Heather playing Cathy.",1201910400,3,374,3.8076923076923075

7974250,5,B00007855H,"In real life this has happen to me and my daughter in 1994.  We were fortunate that we lived.  My husband is Schzoprenia we found out the hard way.  This movie means so much to me and my daughter because we can relate to it.  I tell my daughter he really loves her but his mind is broken (that's how they describe his sickness) I only seen this movie when it first came out but my daughter wasn't with me,I cried and cried.  Then one time she told she saw a movie that scared her and describe it like this movie.  Then I seen it about a couple of months ago on Lifetime and wrote down the name, (I never knew the name)  now I do and would like to purchase it.  Can you please help.",1080864000,2,681,3.9558823529411766
