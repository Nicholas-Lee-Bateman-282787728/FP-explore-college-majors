8734166,3,B015OU7G0M,"Pros: Cool visuals and character designs, amazing 2D animated sequences, pretty interesting setting and plot, good voice acting.

Cons: Obligatory shoehorned-in romance subplot, unfunny comic relief side characters, generic Nice Guy hero, and the female love interest has the stock Disney heroine personality, AKA Spunky Rebellious Girl Who Wants To Have Adventures Despite Her Well-Meaning Single Father's Protests(TM).",1465084800,,420,6.241379310344827
8734167,2,B015OU7G0M,"On this planet, new guardians of the sun and moon are being named. The person who was supposed to guard the moon was passed over for Mune. The dark underworld lord steals the sun and the moon to create darkness and chaos, something we really don't see. The two guardians and well as a pretty wax candle who lives in the twilight travel to the underworld to rescue the sun and moon (which is always a crescent, i.e. horned).

The film is loosely based on old world mythology. The sun god was strong, boastful, liked women, etc. Like Samson of the Old Testament. The moon god, who is given special calming powers, becomes the consort of Venus, who in this case is our twilight person. I love the old world aspect of the film, although the plot and scenes were snoozers. The characters were shallow.

I watched the film in English. Used the phrase ""damn right."" The film currently holds a 7.8 IMDB rating (equals solid 4 Amazon stars) and has won 2 international awards. To me this is one of the film that has all the right symbolic elements so you are supposed to like it irregardless that the entertainment value (how I grade films) is lacking. Makes for neat merchandising products...what did I do with my candles.",1464998400,,1214,4.538812785388128
