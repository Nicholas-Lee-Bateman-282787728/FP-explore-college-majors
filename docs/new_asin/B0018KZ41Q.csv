8366821,4,B0018KZ41Q,"I remember this DVD was previously issued under the title of ""Where There's a Will There's A Way"".  It was advertised at the end of The Morton's ""Daughters of The Promise"" DVD.  When I was ready to purchase, some years had passed and with an extensive online search, I was unable to find the DVD title anywhere.  This DVD title came up several times during my search and when I compared it to what was advertised on the ""Daughters of Promise"" DVD, I realized it was the same DVD.  This is from a Women's Conference.

Here are the track listings:  1. Intro & Snippets, 2.  Too Far To Turn Around (Stephanie Dotson) 3. By Faith I Touched Jesus (Pastor Debra Morton) 4. We Worship You O God (Pastor Debra Morton) 5. Exhortation (Pastor Nancy Wilson) 6. Saved (Pastor Nancy Wilson) 7. Trust In The Lord (Evang. Beverly Crawford) 8. Sinners Can Be Winners (Kimberly Maxwell) 9. Exhortation (Evang. Sandra Riley) 10. Don't Tell A Sinner (Loretta Lang Jefferson) 11. Exhortation (Dr. Aretha Wilson) 12. Victory In Praise (Pastor Nancy Wilson) 13. Exhortation (Pastor Debra Morton) 14. Breakthrough (Evang. Beverly Crawford) 15. Where Theres's A Will There's A Way (Tara Darnell Alexander).  The Women of Excellence Mass Choir is on hand to back up each song.

The song presentations and exhortations are powerful, anointed and blessed me tremendously, that's why I never gave up on getting this DVD.  I have the CD too.  I would have given five stars except, at this price point I would have expected the picture clarity and sound quality (audio drops out briefly in places) to be improved when it was reissued under this new title.  Not bad enough to keep me from getting my shout on, but that's the only thing that could have been a better.  I would buy again, the praise and worship on this DVD is certainly worth the purchase.  Enjoy.",1380240000,,1831,4.699059561128527
