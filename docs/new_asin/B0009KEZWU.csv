8286143,4,B0009KEZWU,"This DVD showcases some of the skills of two awesome drummers, Ian and Chad.

They casually chat, play individually and together, producing an insight into there playing and background.

Pretty awesome.",1168300800,,202,5.483870967741935
8286144,5,B0009KEZWU,"Chad Smith and Ian Paice are two of the most fantastic drummers I have ever seen. This video shows exactly why. First  Ian starts off and Chad comes right in and they both start building off of eachother for about 12 minutes. Then Ian has his only solo, followed by Chad's solo. Then they finish off with another round. This time, Chad starts off and Ian comes in behind him, building up with a spectacular 15 or so drumming duet.

This video does lack in certain areads, however. The soundcheck portion could have been more in-depth with both artists and the interviews could have been longer, as well. Over all it is still a very good DVD and deffinatly worth it for any fan of Chad and/or Ian. BUY NOW!",1163980800,,705,4.415384615384616
