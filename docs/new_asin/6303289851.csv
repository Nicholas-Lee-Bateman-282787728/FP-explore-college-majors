7842922,5,6303289851,"High quality video, clear and concise.  You should also have the book, because this video directly references the book of the same name.  Nothing flashy here, Carmine uses a bass, highat, and snare drum to teach.  Great for beginners wanting to get the basic patterns and rhythms.",987206400,3,280,4.914893617021277
7842923,3,6303289851,"I've been studing the Realistick Rock(Book) method for more than one year so I decided to buy this video. I thought it could be a good complement to the book,but unfortunatly it's not. It doesn't bring anything new or different from what's in the book. Instead,it contains much less material .I was hoping to see some examples on how to effectively use the rhythms ,or maybe instructions on applying them to a real playing situation,but it's not the case. In fact I've found it redundant,at least for me to own this video after working with the book. Please don't get me wrong;it's not all that bad specially if you don't know how to read music,or don't want to learn how to read. In this case it can be a good starting point for a begginer to learn some basic rock grooves. Anyway,I stongly recommend the book. It's much better than the video.",970531200,5,844,4.559210526315789
7842924,4,6303289851,"Carmine Appice goes through a lot of simple and complex rock beats with a no nonsense approach. With each new rhythm, he starts with the simple and slowly moves to the more complex.  There are no fills covered.  All he uses  is a snare drum, two bass drums, a crash, and hi-hats. But if you can do  all that he can do, you will play like a professional drummer.  This video  is good to have in a collection for reference.  The book would be a big  help, but its not totally necessary.",943833600,6,484,4.184782608695652
7842925,5,6303289851,"Of all the videos I have purchased this was the best most down to earth teaching method I have come across. He doesn't waste any time talking about theories and he doesn't go off on a tangent like most of the other videos  I've seen. Back to back he shows you how to play drums and its one lesson  after the other which is what I have been looking for. And for the price  its a real bargain. Carmine is a master at drum playing and very unique in  his style and I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to learn to play  or is looking to better themselves. I only wish I could find the work book  that should accompany it, I feel it will be very helpful to have that by  your side while practicing and looking at his video.",937612800,7,727,4.041958041958042
