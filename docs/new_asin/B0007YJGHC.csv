8054274,5,B0007YJGHC,"I've had this video for a while now and I still look at it, I love this dvd. I still practice and I must say I can't layoff of it. Get it if you would like to start learning Capoeira, that is if there isn't anyone that teaches it in your area. I know I do not. I learn from youtube videos and this dvd. I also have the book Capoeira Conditioning, get that book too, it really helped me out.",1375315200,,390,3.8271604938271606
8054275,5,B0007YJGHC,"This DVD is in a PAL format which is more common is Western Europe and parts of north Africa. The DVDs in the U.S. are NTSC formatted.  What this means is it may not play on your DVD.  Older DVD players may not play PAL format but most new and even inexpensive DVD players and computers (Mac or PC) with DVD players can.  So check your DVD players guide before purchasing.  If you have an old DVD player that doesn't play PAL and would like to enjoy these DVDs do yourself a favor and buy a new and inexpensive DVD player.  I bought a phillip for $30 at Best Buy that plays these DVDs.

100% capoeira does a great job in representing what capoeira is.  It is broken down into three chapters, Techincal Part, Angola and Regional.  This is part of a series of DVD produced by Independence Production with director Christophe Diez.  He has made 5 films on capoeira as of this writing.  If I had to recommend one of the five DVDs then `100% Capoeira' would be my pick.  Both beginners and intermediate (3 years or more) capoeiristas will learn something from this video.  I have been playing capoeira for about 5 years and have gotten a lot from this video.  The reason for this decision is that `100% Capoeira' has a wide scope of the capoeira world.  From explaining and showing different techniques, to the different styles of capoeira (Angola and Regional), to clips of rodas, and  information about the rodas.  This DVD is basically an all around video on the subject of capoeira.

In my review I will assume that the person who is interested in what the video is about will already have some capoeira background on the names of some of the movements and other aspects of capoeira.  My intent is not on teaching or explaining capoeira but to cover what is in this video.

The first chapter is titled techniques.  It starts off with various warm ups for the knees, legs feet and ankles.  Also have some stretches that would apply to capoeira or other physical activities.  Next the video goes into the ginga, followed by equivas, kicks and other evasive movements.  The nice thing about `100% Capoeira' is that it shows the movements quite a few times so one doesn't have to rewind to often.  Second the video shows the movements from several angels such as the front, back and sides.  A few of the moves are demonstrated in slow motion too.  After a movement is shown then it is demonstrated on a partner so one can see how the kick is effective.  u's, flips and other more complex movements are shown.  After all the movements have been demonstrated it goes into showing sequences that two partners can practice together.  Each of the two partners has a different set of sequences that compliment with each other's move.  There are eight sequences all together.  The video then talks about the roda, its make up and how it is enter and played and shows a demo with a berimbau and two players.

The second chapter is titled Angola.  This section shows clips of Angola rodas.  It focuses on a roda for about 10 to 30 seconds and then flips to another roda.  It doesn't focuses on a complete roda.  Because it pans from one roda to another the video does keep the viewer's attention.  The camera work is done nicely.  It pans in and out to focus on the action and pans with the movement.  I seen some capoeira videos that are done on a tripod or by person who doesn't know how to keep a camera study and have the center focus on the action.  The person or people who videoed the roda knew what they were doing and did a good job at it.  Another DVD by director Christophe Diez that explains and demos basic movement of capoeira is `Basic Technique of Capoeira.'  This video goes over the basic movements that were explained in `100% Capoeira' but also goes further into intermediate movements.",1139356800,9,3792,4.508076358296623
8054276,5,B0007YJGHC,"100% Capoeira is a perfect DVD to start off with if you are learning Capoeira like myslef. I picked up so much information on this DVD that shows all basic movments, the narration helps very much and explains why the movements are nesccaery.",1132876800,7,241,4.627906976744186
