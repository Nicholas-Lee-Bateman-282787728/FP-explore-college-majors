8124086,1,B000FKP0G4,"[I grudgingly give this video ONE star; half would be a truer indication of its worth].

I bought this video so I could use it in a class on Technology & Inventions in American History. My hope was that the program would take advantage of the power of video to actually SHOW how early textile technology and machinery worked. A reasonably astute producer [had he been an educator] would have used the opportunity to show how simple mechanical devices -- cams, belt drives, gear wheels, cranks, block and tackle pulley assemblies and so forth -- were used to extraordinary advantage in the early water-driven textile mills of New England. The technology of cloth production did NOT become noticeably more sophisticated or complex when steam replaced water as the primary source of power in the 1850s and after; so a review of the principal mechanical or industrial changes in that era would not have been too difficult to explain either. In fact, the only difficulty in terms of complex mechanical or industrial details would likely not come until the twentieth century with the introduction of card-driven textile designs and production methods. Pioneered in Europe [France and Germany primarily] and Japan, these changes meshed very nicely with the CAM/CAD methods that revolutionized industry in the Computer Age. Unfortunately this video deals with NONE of these issues. Instead, it relies on a sophomoric and simplistic view of the American Past in order to pompously prattle on about ""the very fabric of our nation's history"". It sounds like what it is: dated propaganda with little or no educational value.

Unfortunately, this is the kind of drivel that educators at all levels are obliged to use as classroom material in America. Because ""entertainment"" is of greater value than ""education"", these simple-minded offerings are pawned off on viewers as an ""easy"" way to learn. However, since real learning involves intellectual exertion, and these materials won't offer anything that involves real thought, the result is inevitable: dumbed down exercises in buffoonery.
___

The story contains the following ""chapter"" headings [though you should be aware that you cannot skip forward seamlessly from ""chapter"" to ""chapter""]: 1) Beginnings; 2) Conflict; 3) Piedmont; and 4) Challenges.

1) Beginnings - This segment starts, inexplicably, in 1776!! a year that has NO RELEVANCE whatsoever for American industrial history. Enveloped in the usual ""birth of our nation"" puffery, the segment eventually deals with Samuel Slater's mill in Rhode Island, and the Boston Associate's industrial city in Lowell, Massachusetts. Both of these ventures deserve to be covered, but not in the superficial way used here. Experienced educators however can use this segment to show [among other things] how ""history"" is routinely reduced to ""propaganda"" when put in the wrong hands.

2) ""Conflict"" deals in superficial and unhelpful ways with the lives of those who labored in the Lowell and other textile mills. In large part it deals with the Lowell Girls, and the autocratic, undemocratic and inhumane ways in which their employers exploited them. That the Irish immigrants of the 1840s gradually took the place of the striking Mill Girls is noted, but not enough is said about what that change entailed both for the Irish, and for later immigrant communities. Again, an experienced educator will know how to use this material in tandem with other sources to show how the past is routinely presented in ways that marginalize and trivialize the lives of ordinary working people. A ""people's history"" approach is strongly recommended here so that students come to realize that ordinary people made their own history, and often told their stories in ways that show how superficial and demeaning our current ""history"" books really are.

3) This section deals with the gradual movement of the textile industry into the Southern Piedmont, particularly after the Civil War. Again, the lives of actual workers are never adequately dealt with, but there's enough here for a good teacher to raise issues about community ""values"", family solidarity, po' boy cultural norms, and the crass anti-unionism of the South's ""industrialists"".

4) The final section talks blandly about the ""Challenges"" facing ""the textile industry"" in the United States, and offers some puff and nonsense about how America has ""met"" those challenges. There are a number of flaws with this section. First, it is insufficiently researched by the production team, so they have little of any merit to say. Second, it deals neither with labor nor with capital. Labor can no longer be used to tell the story of the Textile Industry, because the ""era"" of strikes and ""conflict"" is apparently ""over"" and workers can no longer compete with cheaper overseas workers on the one hand and increasing mechanization on the other. Similarly with Capital: the world of the owners has changed as enormously as that of the workers and corporate ownership and organization has become bureaucratic, faceless and bland. There is no longer a larger-than-life individual, a Giant of the Industry, a Textile Tycoon, whom one can use as a means of ""telling"" the story of the industry. So, ignoring workers, ignoring management, and only alluding in the most superficial ways to the enormous technological changes of the past 50+ years, the video concludes on a vague optimistic note and a backward glance at ""the fabric"" of an American industry.",1313280000,4,5472,5.197278911564626
