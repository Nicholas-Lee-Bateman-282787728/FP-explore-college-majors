3058462,4,B00111YM5G,"Synopsis: The Archangel Gabriel descends into the intermediate world of Purgatory on a mission to destroy a group of fallen angels who have taken control of the realm, thus preventing the human souls there from evolving upward. Six Archs (Archangels) have preceded Gabriel on this dangerous mission and all have mysteriously disappeared into the foreboding landscape. Will Gabriel be able to stand alone against the combined forces of Sammael, Amodeus, Lilith, Molloch, Ahriman and the rest? And what of the six missing Archs? What horrible fate has befallen them?

Critique: The '07 film `Gabriel' has cleverly blended disparate elements from numerable popular, financially successful films and added several interesting ideas of its own into one storyline that may not be highly original but is definitely entertaining.

Recipe for making `Gabriel':
- Begin with the basic ingredients (storyline) from the cult classic `The Prophecy' minus the comedic elements provided by Christopher Walken,
- Blend with the graphic, cinematic style of `Sin City',
- Sprinkle liberally with some of the pervasive melancholy made famous in `The Crow',
- Add a pinch of costuming ala `The Matrix', one creepy looking bald, vampirish bad guy reminiscent of `Blade II', an attractive brunette who bears a strong resemblance to Kate Beckinsale as she appeared in `Underworld' and a little `City of Angels' at the very end.

Secret Ingredient:
-For a deeper more profound flavoring check out an obscure, Indie film from '03 titled `The Despiser'. It also deals with a war in Purgatory in which the ultimate danger is that death in this realm equates to permanent extinction. Sound familiar?

While there are plenty of similarities and comparisons one can make with other films `Gabriel' is still somehow unique enough to carry a distinct flavor and texture all its own that should attract a wide audience of loyal fans. I'm certainly one!",1205539200,112,1919,5.241042345276873
3058463,4,B00111YM5G,I really thought this film would be a cheap Prophecy knock off....which even that was enough i checked it out on netflicks. I was really impressed....unknown cast that did a great job...the writting wasn't the strongsuit but wasn't horrible and the movie was highly entertaining....even though the effects weren't big budget they were ok and the terrific cinematography helped them look better then they were. I ended up buying my own copy after renting it.,1205280000,,457,5.1066666666666665
3058464,4,B00111YM5G,"I watched this last night and was very pleasantly surprised - especially given that I'd never heard of any of the actors before and that the entire movie was made on a $150,000 budget.

It was very [appropriately] dark in ways that reminded me of all that was best about The Crow, Underworld, Sin City, 300, Matrix, etc... and I loved the notion that when the Arcs took on human form, they had to contend with all the emotions and morality issues thereof.

The scene where Gabriel battles Asmodeus was especially riveting. I really liked how Gabriel appears to be borderline consumed rage and hate for this Fallen (note his eyes changing from angelic blue to the more demonic red / amber) but the appearance of the child and Gabriel's subsequent healing of the near comatose prostitute help bring him back to himself.

Very well done. Will definitely watch again and again.",1204848000,4,873,4.730263157894737
3058465,5,B00111YM5G,"The director made a great job  to assemble the history with the special effects and the performance of the actors, in spite of having a low production budget.

I liked very much the performance of Andy Whitfield, although, his performance denotes inexperience in many areas, I believe that he is an actor with a promising future. He has an special presence and he looks well in this movie.
The performance of Dwaine Stevenson (Sammael) is also very remarkable. I could see influences of other films, like Matrix, Underworld and Hellboy.

I think this movie needed depth a little more in the characters: the angels and the demons. A good detail was to use the Biblical names of many angels, like Raphael and Michael, and of demons like Lilith.

I have been pleasingly surprised, and I believe that this film has been a good creative effort.",1204761600,,839,4.76551724137931
3058466,5,B00111YM5G,"This has to be one of the best straight to video releases I have ever seen. The question is why why was it straight to video? The acting was excellent the cinematography was amazing it almost looked like Sin city or Underworld. I loved this film, and it was a very intelligent film. It made so much sense  especially into todays world. Eventually the world will not see light again if we continue on the path we are going. This movie was deep and it just goes to show that the US isn't ready for an intelligent box office hit. I could have seen this any day in the theater over some of this stuff that we waste time to put out. Look at the box office movies now and tell me if you see anything on the level of this on there ? I bet you won't just a bunch of garbage ! How did ""THE EYE"" get released before this ?",1204416000,3,812,3.98159509202454
3058467,5,B00111YM5G,"I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in quite a while. It's dark, gritty, action-packed, but the action doesn't distract from the great story. I especially loved that it didn't shy away from using actual biblical angel names instead of making up something to avoid offending anyone. This movie can be watched on many levels: just for the surface story or for the deeper view of humanity, good, and evil through the eyes of the main character, Gabriel. Either way, it's a great movie for all angel fans or really anyone up for a dark action movie with a good story.",1204070400,53,561,4.564356435643564
3058468,5,B00111YM5G,"This dark, orginally unknown film is building a growing, enthusiastic  following outside of its cult, low budget origins. Shot in the tradition of The Crow, Highlander and Sin City, it has an artsy, comic book appeal. Excellent production qualities, lighting and sets belie its tiny, independent film budget.

This is fantasy-horror stuff, and it takes awhile to get into the twisted apocolyptic world that the characters inhabit. However, the strong acting and near perfect casting soon grips you into this strong and mystical morality tale.

A truly remarkable find in film making, especially noteworthy coming from a group of relative unknowns from Australia. A great add to your collection.",1203984000,41,694,5.348623853211009
3058469,4,B00111YM5G,"I was rather surprised by this film because I expected it to be yet another low budget flop. surprise! It is very good, has a lot of action, gunfighting, and even some special effects that were pretty good.
the story starts off with Gabriel last of the ArcAngels (their spelling, mine is ArchAngel)
well, each time he taps into the ""source aka God"" for power he not only grows weaker, but alerts all the demons exactly where he is.
as if that's not enough, the last 6 arcangels failed to bring about an end to the darkness and now it is totally up to gabriel to end Sammael's Reign of evil and put an end to darkness and finally release the sun.
 a really well done flick but if you are looking for constantine style effects you will be dissappointed. this film has quite a few talkie spots but the story is so compelling you might not notice.
most of the effects are comprised of super strength, speed, some glowy Particle effects and changing eye color. (eyes seem to represent demon (reddish amber) angel (blue) and regular human eyes.)
my only minor gripe with the film was the fact everyone (angels and demons) used guns for fighting and naught else. still great though.

Overall: this is a good film not overloaded with effects, blood and gore etc. it is a gripping story about the final fight for purgatory and the souls of earth and the fallen angels. I'd recommend it.

4 Stars.
Extras Include:
deleted Scenes, and 3 making of featurettes. not bad.

3058473,3,B00111YM5G,"I thought I'd enjoy this movie actually it seemed like a good idea the reviews seemed good then I saw the trailer and got suspicious. The movie is just so poorly made that it was impossible to enjoy it dragged on and the acting was not that good, some of the parts of the movie I felt like I was watching something out of the eyes of someone who was high. As the movie went on I couldn't help but think about how weird it was that Michael was one who fell to human desires when he was the one who led armies to banish Lucifer for not worshiping mankind which to me came off as him being less likely to end up that way. I'm not religious but I did go to catholic school in kindergarten and was the only one in my class who could read and as religion got less interesting someone told me about how special Archangels were so I took an interest in them. Michael a obedient protector, Gabriel the messenger of god and bringer of good news from other things I've watched that include the Archangel Gabriel he seems to not get involved in things unless he has to which could be a good angle to use.  Uriel ends up basically opposite of himself, basically ready to be a bum I still cant decide if the movie was unrealistic to the Archangels it used or if it could of been done with better acting a sharpened version of the plot without it dragging on. I'm going to take a guess that this was a low budget film and the three stars is for the potential it had. I am not a fan of religious movies but I like good stories.",1481932800,,1511,4.10472972972973

3058479,3,B00111YM5G,Andy Whitfield is really good but I don't like movies this dark.  You have to be into heavy dark movies to get through this.

3058480,3,B00111YM5G,"For a VERY low budget we get a fairly good film. It's the ""fairly"" part that dragged my rating to 3 . . . well, actually, I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.

I think the weakest part of the film was its lack of originality. The director, who is also half of the writing team for both the story and the screenplay, has clearly been influenced by a number of other films. That influence creeps into ""Gabriel"" in many scenes and not in a sort of playful nod to the genre.

The acting is reasonable (given the script) and the cinematography is good and consistent. Unfortunately, the sound for the streaming version I watched was quite uneven, loud one moment and too low to hear the dialog the next.

You won't get your answers to Questions of the Cosmos via ""Gabriel"" but it is entertaining. It's not quite a ""cult film"" but is close and, for some, might actually be very enjoyable.",1472774400,,875,4.323170731707317

3058483,1,B00111YM5G,I haven't watched such a poorly made sorry excuse for a plot in a long time. Reading some of the other reviews talking about it being good with a highlander or the crow type of quality is far off based as this movie is not even close. I enjoy the occasional movie away from all the computer generated grains of high quality and get back to some basics like the crow but this was just a waste of money. I don't typically write reviews and I've watched hundreds of movies but I just don't want to see others waste their money like I did.,1470614400,,535,4.153846153846154

3058519,4,B00111YM5G,"I am partial to religiously themed movies and movies about purgatory and angels.  I loved The Prophecy, for example.  So take that into account in my review of Gabriel.

Gabriel involves the angel Gabriel coming to the post-apocalyptic ""Sin City"" of Purgatory to battle fallen angels.  It seems that those souls who don't go to Heaven or Hell go to this city to leave out lives of quiet desperation in a bleak, smelly, dirty and smoggy city to eke out an existence selling and buying drugs and engaging in prostitution.  What else the economy of the city is based on is unexplained, and, frankly, unimaginable.  We don't see into the lives of the average person; so do they know that they lived a previous life on Earth?  Best not to let these kinds of speculation enter the universe; the city is a prop to create an attitude of leather-wearing, decadent nihilism.

The McGuffin is that 7 demons in human form and 7 angels in human form are to battle for the destiny of the city.  This is explained in the prologue, so at least the rules of the game are laid out clearly.  Evil has been doing very well and has either killed 6 of the angels or driven them underground. The 7 demons are rug-chewingly evil, including Samael, who, at times, does a good imitation Vigo Mortenson's characterization of Satan from the Prophecy.  Guns and knives are used to dispatch the demons, frequently in a ballet of shooting and kung fu that reminded me of scenes from Equilibrium.

Eventually, there is an ending where forgiveness and love seem to make all the difference, but after all the fighting, just when there ought to be a victory dinner that recognizes the dead angels Who Gave Their Last  for the cause, Gabriel looks up and yells at God for the meaninglessness of it all.

Huh?  Now, it dawns on him that maybe they didn't need to fight?  They could have resolved the whole thing with a rousing game of Monopoly?

Chalk that up to the post-modern impulse that seems to have to put God in the Dock for everything - we want our rousing story, but if we are post-modern artists, we also have to have our post-modern moment of venting our unhappiness at our ""Daddy Issues.""

Nonetheless, fun story, good acting by the lead, and don't think too much about the logic of the backstory.

That way lies madness.",1432339200,,2297,4.572127139364303

3058522,2,B00111YM5G,"There's been quite a few good films coming out of Australia in recent years, but this is sadly not one of them. I found about GABRIEL by looking at the filmography for the director Shane Abbess, after watching the trailer for his new film INFINI. Since INFINI looked pretty good (from the trailer, at least; it could end up being disappointing), I thought I should give this one a look see. Who knows? Maybe it could be decent? This movie fails on just about every level that matters. What it does get right, or at least makes it a little interesting, is extensive mythology it covers and a cool visual style. Unfortunately, those elements aren't terribly original and have been given better treatment in other films, like PRIEST (which still wasn't good), BLADE RUNNER and DARK CITY. The plot is kind of difficult to sum up, but I'll go ahead and try. Basically, Purgatory is the place where souls go after people die but haven't been judged yet (like in Catholicism). But in the film, there is a battle waged between Light and Dark that takes place in this realm, and currently Dark is winning. There's some rather complicated backstory at the beginning along with some narration, but I'd forgotten most of it in 15-20 minutes. That's how little I cared about what happened onscreen. The worst part about it was how depressingly dull it was. Granted, this is a low-budget film, so I'm not ragging on it for that, but the color palette was too boring. The acting also wasn't great either. Although there was occasionally some moments where it felt emotionally honest/real, most of the time all of the actors talked in this ponderous manner that really didn't work at all. I suppose I should give credit where it's due, so for what it's worth the special effects weren't too bad for a low-budget film. Even the fight choreography and camerawork were pretty decent, although there were far too many closeups (again, probably to hide the budget). Despite the fact that they cribbed the visual aesthetic from a dozen other, better movies, this film doesn't completely discourage me from potentially seeing Shane Abbess' next film. GABRIEL is occasionally inventive, has more plot than it knows what to do with, but ultimately was just too boring to recommend.",1428537600,2,2256,4.802056555269923

3058554,3,B00111YM5G,"I want to say this was a good film but I just can't. I was very disappointed.  The elements are all there but somehow, instead of the story I expected of fantastic winged creatures interacting with humans before facing each other in some vast philosophical showdown just didn't evolve.  All it turns into is one big bloodfest as angels both fallen and not are disposed of.  Gabriel's big speech at the end as he confronts Sammiel about Man being worth teaching and caring for doesn't jell because never anywhere in the movie does he interact with a human. He goes straight for the underbelly where the fallen ones have taken over and stays there. There's not one act of compassion, mercy, or anything else with a mortal to cause that speech.

There were a lot of jarring things in this film, the chief among them Sammiel's eyes which became his focal point whenever he was onscreen...and not in a good way. It may have meant to make the viewer uncomfortable, evidence of his evil. All it did to me was distract. It was a neat point that angel eyes were blue when they were angels, dark when they appeared human, and rimmed in red when they were angry.  Another point I didn't like was the writing in of female angels. There wasn't such a creature. All angels are male. Or were the females who had been angels transgendered somehow once they fell? Or was it simply so we could have a sex scene between Gabriel and one of his fallen brethren?  Whatever...that didn't sit well. The other thing was the dirt and filth. Even in a driving downpour, everyone stayed mired in muck.  Symbolic of their fallen state and the fact they can't get out of it? (I'm reaching here.) Was this entire unnamed city simply a ruin? Were there no ""normal"" people anywhere?

The ending is up in the air. Literally. I was left asking, What happened? Did Gabriel win or lose. In losing did he win or if winning did he still lose? I suppose if one wanted to dig deep and hash it out, one could find all kinds of symbolic, metaphorical, allegorical facets.  Well, I didn't, so I was left with a big question mark and a sense of ""What?""

All in all, I prefer Christopher Walken in The Prophecy.  Oh...and in spite of the winged warrior on the cover (which actually drew me to the DVD) there aren't any wings in this film. Perhaps if there were, it might've been better. This could've been an outstanding film with a little more vision past the blood and gore. As it is, it's simply an action film with angels instead of mercenaries.",1406764800,,2503,4.479120879120879

3058569,3,B00111YM5G,"Its a 2007 Australian  film set in purgatory.and follows the Archangel Gabriel's fight to rid purgatory of the Fallen angels and save the souls of its inhabitants. Gabriel is the first full feature directed by Shane Abbess, and it shows. Good cast, good story, good screen play, and no direction on a budget of $150,000. They all took pay cuts for future derivatives on DVD'S with special features. Somehow, I don't think it worked out just right.
In Australia most films are financed by the government-this was independent. Insurance was the day before filming-everything was brinksmanship. They lied by dropping scenes from the movie for insurance, then added them back.
Seven Fallen Angels are in Purgatory as their domain, while Heaven sends sends Seven Arch Angel to take back control and save the souls of all who live there-but so far the angels sent disappear. Gabriel appears. Angels in Purgatory assume mortal form,(with a soul?) and can die, and have lost almost all of their powers. The ""atmosphere"" in Purgatory is such that it drags the Arch Angels down into decrepit,pitiful shadows of themselves that just want to hide from the Fallen, and not die. Sammael is the Fallen that rules,and he command the others not to kill Gabriel Then it comes down to Angels killing each other.
Sammael refuses to fight Gabriel, [why?] admitting he hated being a creature made to serve, but in Purgatory he can control his own destiny and rule, and tempts Gabriel to join him.
I'll leave the ending to you-if you can get that far. I feel if it was remade in the US with a budget, & director it would really be a box office hit-great story.",1393113600,,1637,4.764084507042254

It acting in this poorly written movie of the Arch Angels, depending on what religion you view how many there really are, is phenomenal.

This movie has a good plot and a lot of insight into human feelings.
If you want a movie that will impress you with world class acting and special effects, you may not like it. Stick with big name movies if that's all you want.

If you like a movie where you can look beneath the surface and relate with the characters in the storyline, this is worth looking into.

It sends the message that it doesn't matter who you are and what you've done, you can always fall victim to the things that will lead you away from God. But then it also shows that no matter how far you move away from God you can always find your way back and even the consequences you may pay for being on God's side.

Despite all the reviews about the logic and trying to explain what the ""cycles"" are and the angels and fallen assuming human forms, it become relevant when they start to address emotions they begin to feel. One of the archangels referred to anger, hate, and fear as ""things we never knew existed"" and ""no one told us it would be this hard."" There is one scene in particular when Gabriel gets so mad his eyes briefly change from blue (the color of the archangels) to brown (color or the fallen) before changing back.

I didn't find it excessively violent compared to most movies today (there is a lot of generalized violence, fighting, beating, some blood spray in shooting scenes...etc) but not anywhere near like in 300.

And as far as the ""how can God not know what happens in Purgatrory?"" comment first off.....it's a movie. Also a lot of people will tell you that sometimes there are places where you don't feel God's presence because all the evil feels so overwhelming.

****Potential Spoilers****
And as far as what happened to Micheal, I'm sorry but it was not clear. There was a reference by Uriel to a surge of power when he fought Samael and then nothing.

And the ending was not overly obvious outside of just knowing that the good guys win.

I would have liked a little more closure in the movie as far as seeing what happened after the fight between Samael and Gabriel. All you know is good guys won.",1333411200,,2206,4.402948402948403

Lots of potential here, but the film was bogged down by some truly awful acting.  The lead character, Gabriel, is a decent actor, and so were the actors depicting Uriel and Raphael (very minor characters unfortunately), but the rest were just mediocre and the guy depicting Sammael was a truly awful cartoon of a villain.  The love interest is just so-so given the potential of the set of circumstances she was given to work with and the love scene is truly ... bland.  Given the R rating, they should have spiced things up.

I probably should have rated this only one star, but the depictions of Purgatory and the sense of helplessness and hopelessness depicted by some of the most minor characters, many of them simply 'extras' without a single spoken line, earned it the second star.

Currently power has shifted to the evil side and the last hope for the good, Gabriel is sent down.  The beginning tells us only one can be sent down every ""cycle"" whatever a cycle is they don't tell us but it doesn't matter because they are all down there now (it made it seem like there was only one at a time).  Inexplicably, they have to take ""human"" form?  What?  I thought they were just souls there?  No, in this world there is a apparently a second chance of life with real physical forms/bodies in purgatory who bleed, eat, drink, party etc.  (already weak story line).  Purgatory looks suspiciously like NYC except it is raining all the time.  So yep, purgatory has electricity, crime, bugs, cars etc.  Just as an aside, you never see any wings so despite the main picture on the cover, there are no real angel battles, just gangster style shootings and poor fight scenes.  The archangels have blue eyes and the fallen angels have orangish red eyes-to make it easy to distinguish.  Spoiler alerts here on out:  So when Gabriel gets there he finds all the other archangels except Michael?  Hmm, wonder where he is . . . uh oh, there is that strange looking guy with white eyes who never gets names and says he used to follow the ways of God but now bosses the fallen angels around. . . do you think?  Yes!  Wow that was a tough to figure out . . . not.  So the entire story is Gabriel killing fallen angels (not exciting action-one fight even has the figures fight in a weird light that changes them to look like yellow cartoons figures).  The other activity is finding the other archangels, well they decided it was too tough and unfair to be sent down there to help out in purgatory so they just gave up and became whores, drunks, homeless, soup kitchen operators etc.  Of course, this is totally reasonable for the archangels . .. not!  The weak story comes down to a final battle with Michael who waits to the end to fight Gabriel just to allow the slow and weak plot to unfold.  The battle at the end is totally useless and if anyone hasn't figured out that guy is Michael they must have been living in a cave or under 7 years old, as it is obvious in this slow and poorly done movie.  I love cult classics, like Highlander that other reviewers mentioned but I hated this.  Andy Whitfield was actually OK as Gabriel but had nothing to work with.

Others have noted the obvious similarity to ""The Prophecy."" True enough but ""The Prophecy"" handled the subject matter so much better. This film is just plain ""too."" Too much style. Too much mood. Too much gloom. I think the director was just trying too hard to put out something really stylish and it grew tiring to me very quickly.

Basically, Gabriel has come to earth to try and rescue some of the other archangels and return them to their former selves and, at the same time, do in archangel Michael who is trying to hunt them down and kill them.

""Prophecy"" had an advantage in that humans were brought into the fray with a would-be priest none the less. Add the Native American, non-Christian contingent and you have for an interesting story. This movie deals almost exclusively with the archangels themselves, so, much of what happens seems removed from anything the normal viewer would have an attachment to.

And the claustrophobia. A huge majority of the shots were close-ups. Everything was framed really tight. Even one scene shot in an abandoned drive-in theater did nothing to open things up. And as most of the actors needed a shave or bandages or washing or whatever it felt as though there were a slimy layer over everything. Just not very pleasant to watch.

I was pleasantly surprised, as the movie wore on, and Gabe started confronting the evil minions of Sammael.

This movie definitely got exciting and worth-while as the film wore on. There was plenty of action, and drama, and a little romance.

The Fallen (Denzel Washington), Frailty (Bill Paxton) and even Constantine (Keanu Reeves) - even if the last wasn't faithful to the original comic it had merits of its own not to mention Tilda Swinton as the Angel Gabriel.

This film just passes on in a rather monotone manner and in retrospect I wasn't entertained. It managed a dark atmosphere well enough and the costumes were decent but the story was terribly lacking and what little there was had no depth. Occasionally it looked as if it was going somewhere and it did but not in a unique or clever way. Nor did the story build on legend or dogma it just went on in a juvenile way.

Fair enough the main danger in Purgatory is hopelessness and fear, helped by the fact that the Arcs (Archangel in a not so cool version) become human there - albeit with Angelic superpowers (making everything a bit confused). This we are told time and time again but telling isn't convincing in itself and the story lacks build up or credit as to how it happens.

3058636,4,B00111YM5G,"Growing up as a Catholic, one is taught of the realm known as Purgatory to be something of a neutral holding tank for the departed earth souls awaiting their final destination in either Heaven or Hell.  Beyond that, not much of Purgatory has been mentioned in my personal Catholic back round.  A Jewish friend of mine has described a similar place (of his teachings) as respite, a place of healing, for souls to recover in, before moving on.  So, it was interesting to see the point of balance of this realm shifted to such a dark and heavy force. I found the parallels between this Purgatory and our own earth realm very interesting to wrestle with through out the film.  'Gabriel' presents the dark night of the human soul so very acutely with all of it's repulsive splendor even unto the Angels sent to deliver this place, and the inhabitants thereof, unto the hands of a light and benevolent God of which they represent.  This place, ""...where even Angels fear to tread"" depicts the thick, intense, struggles with the seven deadly sins of the flesh and the forces of light under fire by the fallen angels near complete in their control.  To see the Arch's (Archangels) succumb, one by one, to the starless landscape is of some comfort and yet abominable simultaneously.  For if the highest and strongest of the Angelic realm struggle so in the dark - then is it no wonder how the human spirit can also become so wretched?

'Gabriel' is no ""chicken soup for soul"", but certainly good food for thought.  It was unexpectedly well acted with a cast of unknowns battling light against dark in very effective cinematography noir, portraying gritty action sequences, interspersed with some very poignant insights gleaming from the shadows.

""You threw me far from Grace. Now I fall unto it."" - Gabriel

I had a hard time rating this film. First off, it seems as if it should be horrible; or at least cheesy and over done. But it's not. It's spectacular. In the tradition of such movies as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Watch-Day-Watch-Two-Movie-Collection/dp/B000V6LSL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Watch / Day Watch (Two-Movie Collection)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Immortal/dp/B0008ENI0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Immortal</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow-Miramax-Dimension-Collector-s-Series/dp/B000059XUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow (Miramax/Dimension Collector's Series)</a>, 'Gabriel' makes up for any plot deficiencies with style and grit. In short, I think it deserves the title Cult Classic in every way :)

The story is this: the ""Arc Angel"" Gabriel has been sent down to Purgatory - a dark city styled much like that created for 'The Crow' - to fight against the Fallen (who control the city). He is the last hope of the Light and has more than just Fallen to worry about. He's been sent down in human form, and for the first time in his existence, must battle to understand the new emotions that go along with his existence: fear, hate, anger, sorrow and even love.

The premise is your standard Good versus Evil, and the idea that Purgatory is city where ""Arcs"" and ""Fallen"" battle for the souls is bit unbelievable. Much of the dialogue is also standard and expected, considering the premise - but for whatever reason, in this case the combination works perfectly.

Stylistically 'Gabriel' is a masterpiece. From camera angles and lighting to visual effects and soundtrack, the film is a wonderfully dark abstraction. Andy Whitfield embodies the role of the conflicted archangel Gabriel - his nuanced and soulful performance bringing heartfelt believability to his character; even in moments that would normally be unparalleled in their cheesiness. All of actors, in fact, shine within their roles, though I will admit, I especially liked Harry Pavlidis performance as the Arc Uriel.

The creators' theatrical influences definitely shone through as well. One scene at the very beginning reminded me of the moment in Brandon Lee's 'The Crow' where Draven is stumbling down the street when a bunch of children run circles around him - able to 'trick or treat' on Halloween for the first time since the gangs took over. There were other throwback scenes like that one, and I loved that the filmmakers payed homage to their inspirations in such a way - without interrupting the flow at all.

A note on the American release: for whatever reason the international (or possibly just the U.S.) release has a different ending than the original Australian version. Not to spoil, but the original edit made things a lot clearer, and I prefer it. The U.S. edit is a step too abstract and implies the wrong thing in my opinion. However, it is purported that 'Gabriel' is the first of of a trilogy - the second and third parts to be released at an unknown date in the future - so maybe the end of the first will be worked out at a some other time. Personally, I hope that's sooner rather than later :)

There are slight hints of Constantine and The Matrix and strong elements of the Prophecy Trilogy (starring Christopher Walken) so the movie falls into the action/adventure category. Moreover, the film brings to mind the Dungeons and Dragons' Planescape setting and the fascinating philosophy associated with it.
Andy Whitfield and the rest of the cast do a very good job in their respective roles (though the acting in nothing extraordinary).

This film is not set up for the typical american film that is set up for a person with an attention span that is measured in nano seconds. At times it was hard to follow but i personally believe it adds to the overall affect when everything does click together.
I will admit i am biased in the fact that i have had an affinity toward the mythology associated with angels since i read ""paradis lost"".  taking that out of the picture, everyone should have some affiliation with angels.

Keepers of the each place are angels - the good ones serving light and the bad ones serving darkness.  But listening to these angels argue their position on joining one side vs. another is almost like listening to the premise on why one should work for the corporation vs. working as an independent consultant.  Other interesting premises such as a good angel that is killed by a bad angel (and vice versa) simply dies for the eternity.  These creatures have no souls to take them into a next world, or another body as it is the case with humans.  Angel fallen from the grace (like the one who no longer has wings) is basically turned into a human.  They are punished to live human life with all of its hardships but there is hope that their souls will continue to live. I was turned off by the character of Jade - fallen good angel, turned prostitute.  This would be a beautifu actress if someone can teach her to keep her mouth closed.  Her perpetually open mouth (either her teeth are too big, or she is not using her nose to breathe) make her character too vulgar even for a role of the prostitute, let alone angel.  Standard flight scenes, miracle works and good conquering evil motifs make this film way too predictable.",1224633600,2,1441,4.575875486381323
3058648,2,B00111YM5G,"It could be an interesting story if it is about fallen angels only. However, the director and producers used the names of actual Archangels from the Bible implying that Angels from Heaven who did not fall during the first rebellion (such as Michael, Gabriel, etc.) can fall from grace and, therefore, perish; not so if we follow the Bible. Angels who did not fall during their rebellion; were allowed to a higher degree and now have the Beatific vision of God, therefore, they can not fall now (It would be like saying that people who go to Heaven, could later sin, fall from grace and perish - not so following the Bible). In this way, it's not Biblical faithful as some may think.

As for those who believe in Purgatory, contrary to what this movie says about it, the fate of those souls have already been decided; those souls are being purged or cleaned of all the venial sins they have committed or had at the our of their death before they can enter Heaven; but their fate is not ""yet to be decided"" (as this films says).

Bearing in mind that this is only a fictional story, I like some facts such as that Angels have the capability to appear as human in fleshy form, spend time with humans, live, eat with humans and as humans, etc; (such as the Angels who destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). The villain in this movie is pretty good, I even liked him better than the supposed hero in this movie. Some parts of the movie became slow to me.",1219449600,,1441,4.413533834586466

The scenes in ""Gabriel"" were dark (supposedly because the earth/mankind had fallen to evil and darkness). I think it could've been better done. Somehow angels with (man-made) guns doesn't quite fit right, maybe mystical swords would've been better. But supposedly when Gabriel became human he lost his powers, so I guess he had to resort to guns? But somehow he still had ""some"" powers evidenced in his ability to sense things, forcing people to tell him what he wanted to know, or healing, etc. In general the story line itself was poor: the story of an angel trying to bring light to mankind, without subcoming to the ""human"" vices. He searches for other angels who came but failed at defeating the darkness and evil angels, he tries to remind them of their mission and purpose.

I was actually surprised with the direction the movie took, forcing a very gritty feel of Purgatory, and grating it against the slow decline of morality and society as Demons swayed the balance of power.  In a solid attempt to force the more attentive viewers to weigh what they were watching, the director pushes Purgatory as a near-rendition of Earth itself.  I found myself thinking, ""Is this really what Purgatory is supposed to feel like, or is this more the influence of the Demons pushing the realm towards their end of the spectrum?""  Followed closely by the thought that if Demons were guiding Purgatory into such a decline, is the statement then that Earth is the ultimate decline?

I may have read into this further than some, but I found it an enjoyable tangent to keep in perspective.  Further, the action is solid throughout, and the acting (for a lower budget flick) is fair to good.  The script doesn't leave a whole lot to the imagination, as the plot itself isn't full of too many twists.  I believe a lot of the ""imagination"" comes from the viewer, as they are guided through a turf war between Angels and Demons, intent to sway the balance of power in their own direction.

A movie like this is bound to capture the attention, and hold a place on the favorites' list, of many avid film watchers - especially those that enjoy good action splashed with some flavor and perspective.",1210636800,7,1543,4.619047619047619
3058655,2,B00111YM5G,"I had some hopes for this movie when I picked it up, but after about an hour, my hopes became more concentrated on watching the timer drag slowly towards the 114 minute mark.  This was a very disapointing film and the twist at the end was pretty weak I thought.  All the arch angels of Heaven could not fight the forces of darkness in Purgatory, a place where the souls of people who's fate has not yet been decided go.  I didn't know that that is what Purgatory was supposed to be.  God can't make up his mind?  Anyway, why were the fates of these souls undecided.  They were practicing rapists, theives, killers and prostitutes.  They were drug dealers and sellers of illegal firearms.  They shouldn't have been in Purgatory if the only criteria is that God has not decided on where they should spend eternity.  Anyway, the forces of darkness have taken over and arch angels from Heaven (or THE LIGHT as they called it. I guess because they had to be politically correct and not use words like God, Supreme Being, Creator etc.) were sent down one by one to defeat the forces of darkness and bring light back to Purgatory.  Six archangels fail and Gabriel is the last one.  When he arrives he becomes a warrior in a post-apocolytic looking city or something.  I found it troubling that the weapons of choice by angels would be knives and guns and bombs and lead pipes.  It was hard to accept this place as Purgatory.  Anyway, the movie has it's moments when Jade is rescued, then plays not much of a part any more in the picture and when Raphael is healed.  After that, the film is a series of ever increasingly boring fight scenes, including the final climactic one which seemed to take...well, it took an eternity for goodness sake.

3292959,4,B00111YM5G,"Synopsis: The Archangel Gabriel descends into the intermediate world of Purgatory on a mission to destroy a group of fallen angels who have taken control of the realm, thus preventing the human souls there from evolving upward. Six Archs (Archangels) have preceded Gabriel on this dangerous mission and all have mysteriously disappeared into the foreboding landscape. Will Gabriel be able to stand alone against the combined forces of Sammael, Amodeus, Lilith, Molloch, Ahriman and the rest? And what of the six missing Archs? What horrible fate has befallen them?

Critique: The '07 film `Gabriel' has cleverly blended disparate elements from numerable popular, financially successful films and added several interesting ideas of its own into one storyline that may not be highly original but is definitely entertaining.

Recipe for making `Gabriel':
- Begin with the basic ingredients (storyline) from the cult classic `The Prophecy' minus the comedic elements provided by Christopher Walken,
- Blend with the graphic, cinematic style of `Sin City',
- Sprinkle liberally with some of the pervasive melancholy made famous in `The Crow',
- Add a pinch of costuming ala `The Matrix', one creepy looking bald, vampirish bad guy reminiscent of `Blade II', an attractive brunette who bears a strong resemblance to Kate Beckinsale as she appeared in `Underworld' and a little `City of Angels' at the very end.

Secret Ingredient:
-For a deeper more profound flavoring check out an obscure, Indie film from '03 titled `The Despiser'. It also deals with a war in Purgatory in which the ultimate danger is that death in this realm equates to permanent extinction. Sound familiar?

While there are plenty of similarities and comparisons one can make with other films `Gabriel' is still somehow unique enough to carry a distinct flavor and texture all its own that should attract a wide audience of loyal fans. I'm certainly one!",1205539200,112,1919,5.241042345276873

It was very [appropriately] dark in ways that reminded me of all that was best about The Crow, Underworld, Sin City, 300, Matrix, etc... and I loved the notion that when the Arcs took on human form, they had to contend with all the emotions and morality issues thereof.

The scene where Gabriel battles Asmodeus was especially riveting. I really liked how Gabriel appears to be borderline consumed rage and hate for this Fallen (note his eyes changing from angelic blue to the more demonic red / amber) but the appearance of the child and Gabriel's subsequent healing of the near comatose prostitute help bring him back to himself.

The performance of Dwaine Stevenson (Sammael) is also very remarkable. I could see influences of other films, like Matrix, Underworld and Hellboy.

I think this movie needed depth a little more in the characters: the angels and the demons. A good detail was to use the Biblical names of many angels, like Raphael and Michael, and of demons like Lilith.

Shot in the tradition of The Crow, Highlander and Sin City, it has an artsy, comic book appeal. Excellent production qualities, lighting and sets belie its tiny, independent film budget.

This is fantasy-horror stuff, and it takes awhile to get into the twisted apocolyptic world that the characters inhabit. However, the strong acting and near perfect casting soon grips you into this strong and mystical morality tale.

the story starts off with Gabriel last of the ArcAngels (their spelling, mine is ArchAngel)
well, each time he taps into the ""source aka God"" for power he not only grows weaker, but alerts all the demons exactly where he is.
as if that's not enough, the last 6 arcangels failed to bring about an end to the darkness and now it is totally up to gabriel to end Sammael's Reign of evil and put an end to darkness and finally release the sun.
 a really well done flick but if you are looking for constantine style effects you will be dissappointed. this film has quite a few talkie spots but the story is so compelling you might not notice.
most of the effects are comprised of super strength, speed, some glowy Particle effects and changing eye color. (eyes seem to represent demon (reddish amber) angel (blue) and regular human eyes.)
my only minor gripe with the film was the fact everyone (angels and demons) used guns for fighting and naught else. still great though.

Overall: this is a good film not overloaded with effects, blood and gore etc. it is a gripping story about the final fight for purgatory and the souls of earth and the fallen angels. I'd recommend it.

4 Stars.

deleted Scenes, and 3 making of featurettes. not bad.

The movie is just so poorly made that it was impossible to enjoy it dragged on and the acting was not that good, some of the parts of the movie I felt like I was watching something out of the eyes of someone who was high. As the movie went on I couldn't help but think about how weird it was that Michael was one who fell to human desires when he was the one who led armies to banish Lucifer for not worshiping mankind which to me came off as him being less likely to end up that way. I'm not religious but I did go to catholic school in kindergarten and was the only one in my class who could read and as religion got less interesting someone told me about how special Archangels were so I took an interest in them. Michael a obedient protector, Gabriel the messenger of god and bringer of good news from other things I've watched that include the Archangel Gabriel he seems to not get involved in things unless he has to which could be a good angle to use.  Uriel ends up basically opposite of himself, basically ready to be a bum I still cant decide if the movie was unrealistic to the Archangels it used or if it could of been done with better acting a sharpened version of the plot without it dragging on.

3292977,3,B00111YM5G,"For a VERY low budget we get a fairly good film. It's the ""fairly"" part that dragged my rating to 3 . . . well, actually, I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.

I think the weakest part of the film was its lack of originality. The director, who is also half of the writing team for both the story and the screenplay, has clearly been influenced by a number of other films. That influence creeps into ""Gabriel"" in many scenes and not in a sort of playful nod to the genre.

The acting is reasonable (given the script) and the cinematography is good and consistent. Unfortunately, the sound for the streaming version I watched was quite uneven, loud one moment and too low to hear the dialog the next.

You won't get your answers to Questions of the Cosmos via ""Gabriel"" but it is entertaining. It's not quite a ""cult film"" but is close and, for some, might actually be very enjoyable.",1472774400,,875,4.323170731707317

3293016,4,B00111YM5G,"I am partial to religiously themed movies and movies about purgatory and angels.  I loved The Prophecy, for example.  So take that into account in my review of Gabriel.

Gabriel involves the angel Gabriel coming to the post-apocalyptic ""Sin City"" of Purgatory to battle fallen angels.  It seems that those souls who don't go to Heaven or Hell go to this city to leave out lives of quiet desperation in a bleak, smelly, dirty and smoggy city to eke out an existence selling and buying drugs and engaging in prostitution.  What else the economy of the city is based on is unexplained, and, frankly, unimaginable.  We don't see into the lives of the average person; so do they know that they lived a previous life on Earth?  Best not to let these kinds of speculation enter the universe; the city is a prop to create an attitude of leather-wearing, decadent nihilism.

The McGuffin is that 7 demons in human form and 7 angels in human form are to battle for the destiny of the city.  This is explained in the prologue, so at least the rules of the game are laid out clearly.  Evil has been doing very well and has either killed 6 of the angels or driven them underground. The 7 demons are rug-chewingly evil, including Samael, who, at times, does a good imitation Vigo Mortenson's characterization of Satan from the Prophecy.  Guns and knives are used to dispatch the demons, frequently in a ballet of shooting and kung fu that reminded me of scenes from Equilibrium.

Eventually, there is an ending where forgiveness and love seem to make all the difference, but after all the fighting, just when there ought to be a victory dinner that recognizes the dead angels Who Gave Their Last  for the cause, Gabriel looks up and yells at God for the meaninglessness of it all.

Huh?  Now, it dawns on him that maybe they didn't need to fight?  They could have resolved the whole thing with a rousing game of Monopoly?

Chalk that up to the post-modern impulse that seems to have to put God in the Dock for everything - we want our rousing story, but if we are post-modern artists, we also have to have our post-modern moment of venting our unhappiness at our ""Daddy Issues.""

Nonetheless, fun story, good acting by the lead, and don't think too much about the logic of the backstory.

That way lies madness.",1432339200,,2297,4.572127139364303

3293019,2,B00111YM5G,"There's been quite a few good films coming out of Australia in recent years, but this is sadly not one of them. I found about GABRIEL by looking at the filmography for the director Shane Abbess, after watching the trailer for his new film INFINI. Since INFINI looked pretty good (from the trailer, at least; it could end up being disappointing), I thought I should give this one a look see. Who knows? Maybe it could be decent? This movie fails on just about every level that matters. What it does get right, or at least makes it a little interesting, is extensive mythology it covers and a cool visual style. Unfortunately, those elements aren't terribly original and have been given better treatment in other films, like PRIEST (which still wasn't good), BLADE RUNNER and DARK CITY. The plot is kind of difficult to sum up, but I'll go ahead and try. Basically, Purgatory is the place where souls go after people die but haven't been judged yet (like in Catholicism). But in the film, there is a battle waged between Light and Dark that takes place in this realm, and currently Dark is winning. There's some rather complicated backstory at the beginning along with some narration, but I'd forgotten most of it in 15-20 minutes. That's how little I cared about what happened onscreen. The worst part about it was how depressingly dull it was. Granted, this is a low-budget film, so I'm not ragging on it for that, but the color palette was too boring. The acting also wasn't great either. Although there was occasionally some moments where it felt emotionally honest/real, most of the time all of the actors talked in this ponderous manner that really didn't work at all. I suppose I should give credit where it's due, so for what it's worth the special effects weren't too bad for a low-budget film. Even the fight choreography and camerawork were pretty decent, although there were far too many closeups (again, probably to hide the budget). Despite the fact that they cribbed the visual aesthetic from a dozen other, better movies, this film doesn't completely discourage me from potentially seeing Shane Abbess' next film. GABRIEL is occasionally inventive, has more plot than it knows what to do with, but ultimately was just too boring to recommend.",1428537600,2,2256,4.802056555269923

3293051,3,B00111YM5G,"I want to say this was a good film but I just can't. I was very disappointed.  The elements are all there but somehow, instead of the story I expected of fantastic winged creatures interacting with humans before facing each other in some vast philosophical showdown just didn't evolve.  All it turns into is one big bloodfest as angels both fallen and not are disposed of.  Gabriel's big speech at the end as he confronts Sammiel about Man being worth teaching and caring for doesn't jell because never anywhere in the movie does he interact with a human. He goes straight for the underbelly where the fallen ones have taken over and stays there. There's not one act of compassion, mercy, or anything else with a mortal to cause that speech.

There were a lot of jarring things in this film, the chief among them Sammiel's eyes which became his focal point whenever he was onscreen...and not in a good way. It may have meant to make the viewer uncomfortable, evidence of his evil. All it did to me was distract. It was a neat point that angel eyes were blue when they were angels, dark when they appeared human, and rimmed in red when they were angry.  Another point I didn't like was the writing in of female angels. There wasn't such a creature. All angels are male. Or were the females who had been angels transgendered somehow once they fell? Or was it simply so we could have a sex scene between Gabriel and one of his fallen brethren?  Whatever...that didn't sit well. The other thing was the dirt and filth. Even in a driving downpour, everyone stayed mired in muck.  Symbolic of their fallen state and the fact they can't get out of it? (I'm reaching here.) Was this entire unnamed city simply a ruin? Were there no ""normal"" people anywhere?

The ending is up in the air. Literally. I was left asking, What happened? Did Gabriel win or lose. In losing did he win or if winning did he still lose? I suppose if one wanted to dig deep and hash it out, one could find all kinds of symbolic, metaphorical, allegorical facets.  Well, I didn't, so I was left with a big question mark and a sense of ""What?""

All in all, I prefer Christopher Walken in The Prophecy.  Oh...and in spite of the winged warrior on the cover (which actually drew me to the DVD) there aren't any wings in this film. Perhaps if there were, it might've been better. This could've been an outstanding film with a little more vision past the blood and gore.

3293066,3,B00111YM5G,"Its a 2007 Australian  film set in purgatory.and follows the Archangel Gabriel's fight to rid purgatory of the Fallen angels and save the souls of its inhabitants. Gabriel is the first full feature directed by Shane Abbess, and it shows. Good cast, good story, good screen play, and no direction on a budget of $150,000. They all took pay cuts for future derivatives on DVD'S with special features. Somehow, I don't think it worked out just right.
In Australia most films are financed by the government-this was independent. Insurance was the day before filming-everything was brinksmanship. They lied by dropping scenes from the movie for insurance, then added them back.
Seven Fallen Angels are in Purgatory as their domain, while Heaven sends sends Seven Arch Angel to take back control and save the souls of all who live there-but so far the angels sent disappear. Gabriel appears. Angels in Purgatory assume mortal form,(with a soul?) and can die, and have lost almost all of their powers. The ""atmosphere"" in Purgatory is such that it drags the Arch Angels down into decrepit,pitiful shadows of themselves that just want to hide from the Fallen, and not die. Sammael is the Fallen that rules,and he command the others not to kill Gabriel Then it comes down to Angels killing each other.
Sammael refuses to fight Gabriel, [why?] admitting he hated being a creature made to serve, but in Purgatory he can control his own destiny and rule, and tempts Gabriel to join him.
I'll leave the ending to you-if you can get that far. I feel if it was remade in the US with a budget, & director it would really be a box office hit-great story.",1393113600,,1637,4.764084507042254

In Gabriel he is the main character and he is vibrant, almost the moment his brown contact lenses go in, his whole persona just drains away...  his piercing eyes are always thing you watch the deepest without realizing it.

The movie is set in a time where the dark or ""evil"" has taken over and Gabriel is the last of the person, well angel, who can save the day. Finding out what happened to all the other previous archangels is also interesting and sad. The movie has a nice surprise at near the end. The acting is also great though one of the guess kind of sounds like a stereotypical Cali surfer. I wish the US film studios would put out movies like this that are not only visually entertaining and interesting, but also have good acting, and a new take on an old story. I highly recommend watching this film.",1337904000,,729,4.251798561151079
3293104,5,B00111YM5G,"I like a lot of non mainstream movies like this on. I liked Priest which most people thought was terrible.
This movie has a good plot and a lot of insight into human feelings.
If you want a movie that will impress you with world class acting and special effects, you may not like it. Stick with big name movies if that's all you want.

If you like a movie where you can look beneath the surface and relate with the characters in the storyline, this is worth looking into.

It sends the message that it doesn't matter who you are and what you've done, you can always fall victim to the things that will lead you away from God. But then it also shows that no matter how far you move away from God you can always find your way back and even the consequences you may pay for being on God's side.

Despite all the reviews about the logic and trying to explain what the ""cycles"" are and the angels and fallen assuming human forms, it become relevant when they start to address emotions they begin to feel. One of the archangels referred to anger, hate, and fear as ""things we never knew existed"" and ""no one told us it would be this hard."" There is one scene in particular when Gabriel gets so mad his eyes briefly change from blue (the color of the archangels) to brown (color or the fallen) before changing back.

I didn't find it excessively violent compared to most movies today (there is a lot of generalized violence, fighting, beating, some blood spray in shooting scenes...etc) but not anywhere near like in 300.

And as far as the ""how can God not know what happens in Purgatrory?"" comment first off.....it's a movie. Also a lot of people will tell you that sometimes there are places where you don't feel God's presence because all the evil feels so overwhelming.

****Potential Spoilers****
And as far as what happened to Micheal, I'm sorry but it was not clear. There was a reference by Uriel to a surge of power when he fought Samael and then nothing.

And the ending was not overly obvious outside of just knowing that the good guys win.

I would have liked a little more closure in the movie as far as seeing what happened after the fight between Samael and Gabriel. All you know is good guys won.",1333411200,,2206,4.402948402948403

Not in a 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' or 'Army of Darkness' kind of cult-strange (which I adore in all of its campy awfulness), but just strange.  Lots of potential here, but the film was bogged down by some truly awful acting.  The lead character, Gabriel, is a decent actor, and so were the actors depicting Uriel and Raphael (very minor characters unfortunately), but the rest were just mediocre and the guy depicting Sammael was a truly awful cartoon of a villain.  The love interest is just so-so given the potential of the set of circumstances she was given to work with and the love scene is truly ... bland.  Given the R rating, they should have spiced things up.

I probably should have rated this only one star, but the depictions of Purgatory and the sense of helplessness and hopelessness depicted by some of the most minor characters, many of them simply 'extras' without a single spoken line, earned it the second star.  The whorehouse bouncer was kind of funny.  The children without lines ... there was more acting in those tormented kids faces than most of the major characters.

Currently power has shifted to the evil side and the last hope for the good, Gabriel is sent down.  The beginning tells us only one can be sent down every ""cycle"" whatever a cycle is they don't tell us but it doesn't matter because they are all down there now (it made it seem like there was only one at a time).  Inexplicably, they have to take ""human"" form?  What?  I thought they were just souls there?  No, in this world there is a apparently a second chance of life with real physical forms/bodies in purgatory who bleed, eat, drink, party etc.  (already weak story line).  Purgatory looks suspiciously like NYC except it is raining all the time.  So yep, purgatory has electricity, crime, bugs, cars etc.  Just as an aside, you never see any wings so despite the main picture on the cover, there are no real angel battles, just gangster style shootings and poor fight scenes.  The archangels have blue eyes and the fallen angels have orangish red eyes-to make it easy to distinguish.  Spoiler alerts here on out:  So when Gabriel gets there he finds all the other archangels except Michael?  Hmm, wonder where he is . . . uh oh, there is that strange looking guy with white eyes who never gets names and says he used to follow the ways of God but now bosses the fallen angels around. . . do you think?  Yes!  Wow that was a tough to figure out . . . not.  So the entire story is Gabriel killing fallen angels (not exciting action-one fight even has the figures fight in a weird light that changes them to look like yellow cartoons figures).  The other activity is finding the other archangels, well they decided it was too tough and unfair to be sent down there to help out in purgatory so they just gave up and became whores, drunks, homeless, soup kitchen operators etc.  Of course, this is totally reasonable for the archangels . .. not!  The weak story comes down to a final battle with Michael who waits to the end to fight Gabriel just to allow the slow and weak plot to unfold.  The battle at the end is totally useless and if anyone hasn't figured out that guy is Michael they must have been living in a cave or under 7 years old, as it is obvious in this slow and poorly done movie.  I love cult classics, like Highlander that other reviewers mentioned but I hated this.  Andy Whitfield was actually OK as Gabriel but had nothing to work with.  Samantha Noble as Jade was ridiculous, she needs to close her mouth.  It hangs open the entire film and makes her look mentally slow (although she could just be bored with the movie!).",1309824000,6,2662,4.416837782340862

Others have noted the obvious similarity to ""The Prophecy."" True enough but ""The Prophecy"" handled the subject matter so much better. This film is just plain ""too."" Too much style. Too much mood. Too much gloom. I think the director was just trying too hard to put out something really stylish and it grew tiring to me very quickly.

Basically, Gabriel has come to earth to try and rescue some of the other archangels and return them to their former selves and, at the same time, do in archangel Michael who is trying to hunt them down and kill them.

""Prophecy"" had an advantage in that humans were brought into the fray with a would-be priest none the less. Add the Native American, non-Christian contingent and you have for an interesting story. This movie deals almost exclusively with the archangels themselves, so, much of what happens seems removed from anything the normal viewer would have an attachment to.

And the claustrophobia. A huge majority of the shots were close-ups. Everything was framed really tight. Even one scene shot in an abandoned drive-in theater did nothing to open things up. And as most of the actors needed a shave or bandages or washing or whatever it felt as though there were a slimy layer over everything. Just not very pleasant to watch.

Running time. At an hour and fifty four minutes, this went on way too long. There just wasn't enough story here to keep it going that long.

I know there are many out there who like this and applaud the style. I suppose if I were younger I might be one of them. But at my age style only goes so far and it just isn't enough to rescue this movie.",1294617600,6,1783,4.538940809968848

I bought it at half-price books to be exact. I figured it looked decent, and worthy of a buy

However, when I put the movie in, I was a little disappointed by the opening. It seems to move a little fast, and I was a little confused. And it almost seemed a little corny, and I almost shut it off within the first 5 minutes. I didn't want this to be recommended to me for the sake of a  hot guy that walks through the whole movie as Gabriel. I was hoping against hope that this movie had some sort of depth.

I was pleasantly surprised, as the movie wore on, and Gabe started confronting the evil minions of Sammael. And the way he really cared to complete his mission, and find his missing brethren fallen to pergatory to save humanity, or rather, so they would know there is hope, and saving from their misery... to believe in something more. Though, the brethren all realize the truth, that humanity has a hard time believing in divinity with all the problems and issues that they face.

This movie definitely got exciting and worth-while as the film wore on. There was plenty of action, and drama, and a little romance. It had the mood and tone of Sin City, and The Crow, with how dark everything was portrayed. And at the end I was very satisfied with how everything had played out.

I hope the key players can use it for their careers, but if you must pick a film that rips off other better films so very much, then there are other better films to buy. The lead bad guy is very like a cut price Rutger Hauer, and may find work in that mold ( or is it mould ? ).

The Fallen (Denzel Washington), Frailty (Bill Paxton) and even Constantine (Keanu Reeves) - even if the last wasn't faithful to the original comic it had merits of its own not to mention Tilda Swinton as the Angel Gabriel.

This film just passes on in a rather monotone manner and in retrospect I wasn't entertained. It managed a dark atmosphere well enough and the costumes were decent but the story was terribly lacking and what little there was had no depth. Occasionally it looked as if it was going somewhere and it did but not in a unique or clever way. Nor did the story build on legend or dogma it just went on in a juvenile way.

Fair enough the main danger in Purgatory is hopelessness and fear, helped by the fact that the Arcs (Archangel in a not so cool version) become human there - albeit with Angelic superpowers (making everything a bit confused). This we are told time and time again but telling isn't convincing in itself and the story lacks build up or credit as to how it happens.

The small budget is telling and for me I didn't hate it, but felt that my time could have been a lot better spent reading a book or sleeping.

3293133,4,B00111YM5G,"Growing up as a Catholic, one is taught of the realm known as Purgatory to be something of a neutral holding tank for the departed earth souls awaiting their final destination in either Heaven or Hell.  Beyond that, not much of Purgatory has been mentioned in my personal Catholic back round.  A Jewish friend of mine has described a similar place (of his teachings) as respite, a place of healing, for souls to recover in, before moving on.  So, it was interesting to see the point of balance of this realm shifted to such a dark and heavy force. I found the parallels between this Purgatory and our own earth realm very interesting to wrestle with through out the film.  'Gabriel' presents the dark night of the human soul so very acutely with all of it's repulsive splendor even unto the Angels sent to deliver this place, and the inhabitants thereof, unto the hands of a light and benevolent God of which they represent.  This place, ""...where even Angels fear to tread"" depicts the thick, intense, struggles with the seven deadly sins of the flesh and the forces of light under fire by the fallen angels near complete in their control.  To see the Arch's (Archangels) succumb, one by one, to the starless landscape is of some comfort and yet abominable simultaneously.  For if the highest and strongest of the Angelic realm struggle so in the dark - then is it no wonder how the human spirit can also become so wretched?

'Gabriel' is no ""chicken soup for soul"", but certainly good food for thought.  It was unexpectedly well acted with a cast of unknowns battling light against dark in very effective cinematography noir, portraying gritty action sequences, interspersed with some very poignant insights gleaming from the shadows.  You may, or may not, feel delivered by this story, but I felt it certainly delivers.  This film was an unlikely, unexpected gem in the rough for me.

""You threw me far from Grace. Now I fall unto it."" - Gabriel

I had a hard time rating this film. First off, it seems as if it should be horrible; or at least cheesy and over done. But it's not. It's spectacular. In the tradition of such movies as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Watch-Day-Watch-Two-Movie-Collection/dp/B000V6LSL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Watch / Day Watch (Two-Movie Collection)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Immortal/dp/B0008ENI0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Immortal</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow-Miramax-Dimension-Collector-s-Series/dp/B000059XUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow (Miramax/Dimension Collector's Series)</a>, 'Gabriel' makes up for any plot deficiencies with style and grit. In short, I think it deserves the title Cult Classic in every way :)

The story is this: the ""Arc Angel"" Gabriel has been sent down to Purgatory - a dark city styled much like that created for 'The Crow' - to fight against the Fallen (who control the city). He is the last hope of the Light and has more than just Fallen to worry about. He's been sent down in human form, and for the first time in his existence, must battle to understand the new emotions that go along with his existence: fear, hate, anger, sorrow and even love.

The premise is your standard Good versus Evil, and the idea that Purgatory is city where ""Arcs"" and ""Fallen"" battle for the souls is bit unbelievable. Much of the dialogue is also standard and expected, considering the premise - but for whatever reason, in this case the combination works perfectly.

Stylistically 'Gabriel' is a masterpiece. From camera angles and lighting to visual effects and soundtrack, the film is a wonderfully dark abstraction. Andy Whitfield embodies the role of the conflicted archangel Gabriel - his nuanced and soulful performance bringing heartfelt believability to his character; even in moments that would normally be unparalleled in their cheesiness. All of actors, in fact, shine within their roles, though I will admit, I especially liked Harry Pavlidis performance as the Arc Uriel.

The creators' theatrical influences definitely shone through as well. One scene at the very beginning reminded me of the moment in Brandon Lee's 'The Crow' where Draven is stumbling down the street when a bunch of children run circles around him - able to 'trick or treat' on Halloween for the first time since the gangs took over. There were other throwback scenes like that one, and I loved that the filmmakers payed homage to their inspirations in such a way - without interrupting the flow at all.

A note on the American release: for whatever reason the international (or possibly just the U.S.) release has a different ending than the original Australian version. Not to spoil, but the original edit made things a lot clearer, and I prefer it. The U.S. edit is a step too abstract and implies the wrong thing in my opinion. However, it is purported that 'Gabriel' is the first of of a trilogy - the second and third parts to be released at an unknown date in the future - so maybe the end of the first will be worked out at a some other time. Personally, I hope that's sooner rather than later :)

Also, the website ([...]) and Facebook ([...]) pages are a real treat and worth checking out if you interested in connecting with other fans, or just looking at what went into this film, and what is to come in the trilogy.",1252368000,6,3710,5.308347529812607

But listening to these angels argue their position on joining one side vs. another is almost like listening to the premise on why one should work for the corporation vs. working as an independent consultant.  Other interesting premises such as a good angel that is killed by a bad angel (and vice versa) simply dies for the eternity.  These creatures have no souls to take them into a next world, or another body as it is the case with humans.  Angel fallen from the grace (like the one who no longer has wings) is basically turned into a human.  They are punished to live human life with all of its hardships but there is hope that their souls will continue to live. I was turned off by the character of Jade - fallen good angel, turned prostitute.  This would be a beautifu actress if someone can teach her to keep her mouth closed.

3293145,2,B00111YM5G,"It could be an interesting story if it is about fallen angels only. However, the director and producers used the names of actual Archangels from the Bible implying that Angels from Heaven who did not fall during the first rebellion (such as Michael, Gabriel, etc.) can fall from grace and, therefore, perish; not so if we follow the Bible. Angels who did not fall during their rebellion; were allowed to a higher degree and now have the Beatific vision of God, therefore, they can not fall now (It would be like saying that people who go to Heaven, could later sin, fall from grace and perish - not so following the Bible). In this way, it's not Biblical faithful as some may think.

As for those who believe in Purgatory, contrary to what this movie says about it, the fate of those souls have already been decided; those souls are being purged or cleaned of all the venial sins they have committed or had at the our of their death before they can enter Heaven; but their fate is not ""yet to be decided"" (as this films says).

Bearing in mind that this is only a fictional story, I like some facts such as that Angels have the capability to appear as human in fleshy form, spend time with humans, live, eat with humans and as humans, etc; (such as the Angels who destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah).

The scenes in ""Gabriel"" were dark (supposedly because the earth/mankind had fallen to evil and darkness). I think it could've been better done. Somehow angels with (man-made) guns doesn't quite fit right, maybe mystical swords would've been better. But supposedly when Gabriel became human he lost his powers, so I guess he had to resort to guns? But somehow he still had ""some"" powers evidenced in his ability to sense things, forcing people to tell him what he wanted to know, or healing, etc. In general the story line itself was poor: the story of an angel trying to bring light to mankind, without subcoming to the ""human"" vices. He searches for other angels who came but failed at defeating the darkness and evil angels, he tries to remind them of their mission and purpose. Personally I found that there was very little depth to the characters, it was hard to identify with anyone. Maybe some people might actually like it. I for one, think it was a waste of my money, I should've rented it first . . .",1212278400,8,1366,4.672199170124482

I really liked this movie. I thought the acting was good, and it's right up my line of action, love, and darkness. I think people should give this movie a try. And if you like it, try Equilibrium next. That's a really good one too!",1211587200,,415,4.32051282051282
3293151,5,B00111YM5G,"'Gabriel' was a movie that, on it's surface, didn't have a screaming potential.  I picked it up on a whim as a rental, expecting a fair movie.  I was actually surprised with the direction the movie took, forcing a very gritty feel of Purgatory, and grating it against the slow decline of morality and society as Demons swayed the balance of power.  In a solid attempt to force the more attentive viewers to weigh what they were watching, the director pushes Purgatory as a near-rendition of Earth itself.  I found myself thinking, ""Is this really what Purgatory is supposed to feel like, or is this more the influence of the Demons pushing the realm towards their end of the spectrum?""  Followed closely by the thought that if Demons were guiding Purgatory into such a decline, is the statement then that Earth is the ultimate decline?

I may have read into this further than some, but I found it an enjoyable tangent to keep in perspective.  Further, the action is solid throughout, and the acting (for a lower budget flick) is fair to good.  The script doesn't leave a whole lot to the imagination, as the plot itself isn't full of too many twists.  I believe a lot of the ""imagination"" comes from the viewer, as they are guided through a turf war between Angels and Demons, intent to sway the balance of power in their own direction.

A movie like this is bound to capture the attention, and hold a place on the favorites' list, of many avid film watchers - especially those that enjoy good action splashed with some flavor and perspective.",1210636800,7,1543,4.619047619047619
3293152,2,B00111YM5G,"I had some hopes for this movie when I picked it up, but after about an hour, my hopes became more concentrated on watching the timer drag slowly towards the 114 minute mark.  This was a very disapointing film and the twist at the end was pretty weak I thought.  All the arch angels of Heaven could not fight the forces of darkness in Purgatory, a place where the souls of people who's fate has not yet been decided go.  I didn't know that that is what Purgatory was supposed to be.  God can't make up his mind?  Anyway, why were the fates of these souls undecided.  They were practicing rapists, theives, killers and prostitutes.  They were drug dealers and sellers of illegal firearms.  They shouldn't have been in Purgatory if the only criteria is that God has not decided on where they should spend eternity.  Anyway, the forces of darkness have taken over and arch angels from Heaven (or THE LIGHT as they called it. I guess because they had to be politically correct and not use words like God, Supreme Being, Creator etc.) were sent down one by one to defeat the forces of darkness and bring light back to Purgatory.  Six archangels fail and Gabriel is the last one.  When he arrives he becomes a warrior in a post-apocolytic looking city or something.  I found it troubling that the weapons of choice by angels would be knives and guns and bombs and lead pipes.  It was hard to accept this place as Purgatory.  Anyway, the movie has it's moments when Jade is rescued, then plays not much of a part any more in the picture and when Raphael is healed.  After that, the film is a series of ever increasingly boring fight scenes, including the final climactic one which seemed to take...well, it took an eternity for goodness sake.  This isn't really an unwatchable film but I would not recommend it to anyone and for sure would never consider owning it.",1207958400,17,1858,4.517964071856287
3293153,3,B00111YM5G,"If you liked UNDERWORLD, but thought it would be better with Angels (called Arcs) and Demons (called the Fallen) instead of Vampires and Werewolves (called Lycans), then your dreams have just been answered! This movie is really stupid, and it consists mainly of bad actors standing around talking about a comic book version of metaphysics, but it is so poorly thought out and executed, it is fascinating and wonderful. Try to follow the confused philosophy that is being chewed on and explained through the entire film. Attempt to understand the logic of the BIG SHOCK waiting for you in the last 20 minutes. Make a list of all the scenes that are lifted directly from other films. Absolute Heaven for lovers of Bad Cinema! Also, is Samantha Noble so ugly she's beautiful or so beautiful she's ugly? I really couldn't figure it out, but I couldn't take my eyes off her. I will watch every film she's in for the rest of my life.
