7869904,5,6304406363,"The Last of the Summer Wine Collection Set is a VHS set of the first nine episodes of the comedy series in the 1970s. These are the episodes that have not yet been issued in DVD and fit in well with my DVD collection. Until they are issued in DVD, I still can see them on the old VHS player.",1319587200,,291,3.8666666666666667
7869905,5,6304406363,"If you enjoy British Comedy and like a laid back style you will love these.  They are funny and entertaining.  Watching the antics of the trio and the scrapes that they get into and how they get out of them.  The Getting Sam Home video is especially funny in an almost morbid fashion, first as they sneak their friend to see his lady friend and then one last time after he passes on.",1043884800,5,383,4.219178082191781
7869906,5,6304406363,"Those familiar with Open All Hours or Keeping Up Appearances will already be familiar with writer Roy Clarke's distinctive brand of humour, and if you enjoy the type of humour in either of these two shows, Summer Wine (which by the way has been going strong--with so many of the original actors, too--for 30+ years) is certainly worth checking out.  Humour aside, however, this series (particularly the early episodes which this collection features) is somewhat different from the other two.  It's overall a very laidback, gentle series filled with some extremely scenic views of the Yorkshire dales and the loveliest theme music of any Britcom.  One ought not to expect, therefore, to find a powerhouse (like Hyacinth or Arkwright) leading the show (oh, they are here, but they're relegated to supporting roles!).  Rather the series revolves around the humorous adolescent antics and ""philosophical"" musings of three carefree, lay-about geriatric men as they wander about the countryside or saunter from the library (from whence they are inevitably being evicted for misbehaving!) to the cafe (where we are always sure of being entertained by a classic Roy Clarke battle or two between cafe owners Sid (who died of throat cancer in 1984) and his burly, battle-axe wife Ivy).
As for the three central stars, they are comprised of the tatty, peg-toothed Compo Simonite (Bill Owen, who sadly died at age 85 of pancreatic cancer in 1999--like most, he was with the show till the very end), who's spent his life on dole, is the most rangy-tang and mischievous of the lot, and is forever dreaming of his neighbour, Nora Batty--wrinkled stockings and all.  Then there's Norman Clegg (Peter Sallis), the real ""philosopher"" of the gang (who's got some great lines, but you must listen for them lest they pass you right by) and a man who's terrified of women; as he was once married, he speaks from experience!  Lastly, there's Cyril Blamire (Michael Bates, who left the show after 13 episodes due to groin cancer; he died shortly thereafter), the most industrious, enterprising, and ""presentable"" of the lot (though strictly by comparison--he's nowhere near as sophisticated and posh as he likes to think he is!), without whom the other two would never do anything and there'd be no show!
The boxed set contains four videos.  The first three contain the first nine episodes dating from 1973 to 1975.  Each episode is 30 minutes, although (for some reason) the video company has run the first three episodes into one long 90-minute episode.
The final tape consists of an hilarious 90-minute special episode from 1983 entitled ""Getting Sam Home.""  The episode features the humorously regimental (but totally inept) ex-military man, Foggy Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who took over after Bates left and is, for many, the favourite ""third man"" (there have been four men in that role to date).  In this episode, we finally get to meet Nora Batty's poor hen-pecked husband, Wally (Joe Gladwin, who died in 1987).  It also features Lynda Baron (Nurse Gladys from Open All Hours) and is the only episode that I know of to feature vocal accompaniment to the theme song.  Sadly, this was John Comer's (Sid's) last episode, and as he was unable to speak, his lines had to be expertly dubbed.
Our entire family thoroughly enjoys this show (it's my dad's favourite!) and this is a lovely collection with the 90-minute special being the funniest episode we've ever seen (and we've seen most of them).  It's really a shame that there aren't more episodes available, for this show is a classic.  I highly recommend it to fans of British comedy in general, but especially to fans of Roy Clarke's distinctive and delightful brand of humour.  And if you're already a fan, I highly recommend the outstanding tribute book Last of the Summer Wine: The Finest Vintage by Morris Bright and Robert Ross.",1036454400,80,3865,4.970542635658915
7869907,5,6304406363,"Heyup. I'm only 19 but have been watching last of the summer wine for as long as i can remember. Being a Brit i have no problem understanding the 'thick'(completely normal speaking here) yorkshire accents, infact I speak a little like compo myself.
I would recommend this series for anyone to watch, it has all  the true workings of a great comedy. Also it has 30 years of experience.
All i need to say is that it is BLOODY FANTASTIC! and go watch it now! ! ! !",1028073600,7,461,4.238636363636363
7869908,5,6304406363,"if you love a really good laugh/giggle then this video will do it i have seen these videos before including getting sam home which i have to say is also hilarious especially the bit were a gentleman takes his dog for a walk and spots foggy  swathed in a white gown in a coffin  which is inside a shed he foggy sits up in the coffin and nearly gives the gentleman heart attack
tell you what though i have never seen the gentleman move so fast dog and all
sid also takes a good part especially when compo says who`s in the coffin and he (sid) replies,who do you thinks in sids in
the sight of the three old people (compo clegg and foggy trying to smuggle a poor deceased sam out of lily-bless-hers (linda baron)before his wife finds out is hilarious
especially amusing is were compo has to lend a suit from sams wife for the funeral and when they have to stop a the dairy on the way
sam dies with a smile on his face at lily bless hers absolutely true blue 100%hilarious
all the characters in these videos take a good part
on one of the videos (not the film) there is an episode called the changing face of rural blamire,this too is absolutely hilarious see cyril blamire hits on a money making scheme shinyglow polish which they inherited from a welshman everything is going brilliantly until suddenly bang the idea backfires leaving poor blamire covered from head to foot in this polish
oh yes this is a comedy to beat all comedies no other comedy even comes close
the actors take a really good part especially the poor deceased bill owen (compo) and the poor deceased gordon wharmby (wesley)
you want a good comedy take my advice and pick this option every time it`s absolutely fantastically brillant and i can`t get enough of it
the scenes are so well played out and all the actors/actresses in summer wine do really well for their age
last of the summer wine is the comedy for me the performances are fantastic and the scenery (holmfirth) is absolutely outstanding and breathtaking
bravo bbc keep up the good work
 please please please please please bring last of the summer wine back to our screens again on bbc1 and uk gold( it has finished on uk gold for now)",1022371200,12,2165,4.434673366834171
7869909,4,6304406363,"How can humour be subtle when talking about women's knickers and flashing pictures of topless women? I don't know, but 'Last of the Summer Wine' manages it. I have to say I much prefer Brian Wilde's frustrated snobbery over Michael Bate's sledgehammer insults so I preferred 'Getting Sam Home' over the other three videos.
If you've never seen this series, you'll be in for a treat. Be sure to watch the programs in a quiet room because you'll have to concentrate to understand the thick Yorkshire accents. Many of the best lines are almost thrown away with no laugh or applause tracks. For example (sardonically from the ex-army guy)
""He collects stamps -- British Commonwealth and Possessions -- which, given the current state of affairs, shouldn't take up too much of anyone's time.""
or
""All he got was a handshake from the district supervisor. A man with bad breath called 'Pilkington'.""
""Strange name for bad breath -- 'Pilkington'""
Watch the scenery too. Both the rural and urban scenes are rich with local flavour. I enjoyed watching these deliquent pensioners walk down rain-slicked cobbled streets as much as romping through the countryside or pointlessly fishing in mill-races.
I hope Amazon get some more of the later episodes in stock -- I'd like to get some more with Brian Wilde in.",1003536000,21,1296,4.922374429223744
7869910,5,6304406363,"I adore this series, and WISH the entire run was available here in the States, but this collection is a great beginning!
The first 3 tapes are episodes/collections of episodes from the first cast in the series-- most US fans have never seen Cyril Blamire of the first trio (Clegg, Compo, & Cyril).
This humour is just wonderful, occasionally hysterical, but mostly good, deep chuckles.  I also love the portrayal of these older characters as feeling like they still haven't ""grown-up""-- makes me feel better!!
The final tape, Bringing Sam Home, is a feature-length movie done in 1983-- it is the final appearance of Sid (Ivy's husband) and is just before the introduction of Wesley and Edie Pegdon and their family.  I believe it is also the end of Foggy Dewhurst's first appearance in the series (the character returned in the late 80s for another run).
Oh, and the scenery is abolutely gorgeous!!  They are still making episodes of LSW, although it is very different following the passing of Bill Owen (Compo) in 1999.  Hope we get more LSW available over here soon!!",995328000,20,1069,4.825136612021858
7869911,4,6304406363,"Getting Sam Home is a must for any true Britcom fan.  The antics of Compo, Clegg,Foggy and friends is in true British style, funny to the bone. This is Britians longest running comedy, 27 years, though new to American tv. So, pour yourself a pint, sit back, relax, and enjoy the Last of the Summer Wine.",972604800,6,303,4.410714285714286
