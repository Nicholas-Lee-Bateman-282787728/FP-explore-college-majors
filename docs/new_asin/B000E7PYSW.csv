8106935,1,B000E7PYSW,"This production is H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E!!! There are so many things wrong with this production that I had to shut it down before the 30 minute mark. Among the problems are footage of battles that happened we after Guadalcanal. The incessant battle sounds are annoying. The narrator declares the Battle of the Coral Sea to be a major U.S. victory. Since when? It was a costly victory that was in essence a draw. The footage alone makes this documentary unwatchable. To make things worse, ""Guadalcanal"" is misspelled on both the front and back cover as well as on the DVD itself. Horrible production quality with little to no research being done before production. If the producers, who are not even mentioned on the package, thought that no one would notice combat footage of Iwo Jima, Tarawa, Okinawa and other battles as well as the use of weapons that were not available until later in the war they were sadly mistaken. I am just glad I did not purchase this DVD but instead checked it out from my local public library. It was still a waste of time.",1422489600,,1046,4.65945945945946
8106936,1,B000E7PYSW,"The Narrator does a good job in telling the story of
Pearl Harbor to the invasion of Gaudalcanal.  As he
tells the story the viedo show scenes of Iwo Jima,
Tarawa, Okinawa.  Carriers with planes of Hellcats,
Corsairs that were not the front line aircraft at
that time.  If you are a WW II buff you will catch
these errors and not give this dvd high marks.  There
are better dvds on Gaudalcanal and I would buy them,
this one is lacking.",1346544000,,436,4.280487804878049
