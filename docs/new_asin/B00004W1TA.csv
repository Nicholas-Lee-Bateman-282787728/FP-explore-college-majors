1361661,3,B00004W1TA,"Buy this if you are interested in Ted Healy's productions from really early Stooge days. If not, skip it. The quality (audio and video) of the DVD is shabby...hence, the low price. There are only 4 of 12 shorts really worth owning, available on other, higher quality products.",1015459200,9,276,4.770833333333333
1361662,4,B00004W1TA,"What a DVD!  This has three hours of extremely rare, hard to find material. And its not filler, like some of the other Three Stooges collections out there; this is all content, baby.  The best part about this collection is that it has many of the hard-to-find shorts with Ted Healy.
The only problem is that no effort was made to clean up the video or the sound, and the original prints from which this DVD was made seem to have been in poor shape in places.  A new release, with the latest in digital remastering, will be most welcome.",1001116800,6,536,4.34
1361663,5,B00004W1TA,"Yes, the picture quality needs work, but this is the earliest stuff the Stooges did.  In fact, a lot of it is pre-Stooge work!  There are several totally random musical numbers in the non-Stooge shorts.  It's particularly interesting to see Shemp work on his own and wonder what his career would have been like without the Stooges; he certainly is a good actor, probably the best out of all the Stooges.  And over 3 hours for around $?!? The world needs more bargains like this.",986515200,3,478,4.588235294117647
1361664,2,B00004W1TA,"I love the Stooges but this was very disappointing. This focuses primarily on Ted Healy. Some of the shorts don't even have all of the stooges in them. This is a good look at the pre-stooge era but it isn't the Three Stooges. The one bright spot was ""Disorder In The Court"".  I have a few other Stooge videos and DVD's and I don't think that this one is on any of the ones I own. The other Three Stooges shorts I already have.",985651200,,426,4.071428571428571
1361665,5,B00004W1TA,"First of all, I got this DVD, primarily for the public domain short films, ""DISORDER IN THE COURT"", ""SING A SONG OF SIX PANTS"",  ""BRIDELESS GROOM"" and ""MALICE IN THE PALACE"", as they  have never been presented on the DVD format, ""respectively"",  until now.  If you've bought the ultra-crappy editions put out by Madacy  and Platinum Disc Corporation, you know what I mean.  The Madacy edition  has a dis-jointed audio track for both ""BRIDELESS GROOM"" and  ""SING A SONG OF SIX PANTS""...so out of sync, it's a rip-off.  Then, the Platinum edition contains nearly 4 minutes of ""BRIDELESS  GROOM"", and that's it!  It is so sad to see that these people are  allowed to put these DVD's on the market, with total disregard for quality.  Which brings me to the item on hand, THE THREE STOOGES COLLECTION: THE  EARLY YEARS, from the good folks at American Home Treasures.  This disc is  such a fantastic curiousity.  Most will complain that the films have not  been ""re-mastered"", or cleaned up in any sort of way, but then  again, we are dealing with public domain material, which has been around  for ages.  Now, we have a DVD that not only successfully compiles the  aforementioned Stooge shorts in their entirety, but 8 more curiousities.  The other shorts are some that I've never seen.  Most of which, are  pre-Columbia, MGM two-reelers with Ted Healy and his stooges, Howard, Fine  and (Curly) Howard.  Then there are some Vitaphone short films, containing  the unsung works of Shemp Howard, working opposite several other contract  players.  A real gem is a film entitled ""ROAST BEEF &  MOVIES"", that stars Jerry Howard, yep, Curly, pre-Stooges!  The  duration of the disc, runs a little over 3 hours and 40 minutes, containing  12 shorts in all.  This is a real treat for die-hard Stooge fans, like  myself, and I would highly recommend it.  Also, for what you get, the price  is unbeatable.",966643200,43,1891,4.79375
7924751,2,B00004W1TA,"I'll go out on a limb here and say I think this DVD is not worth bothering with unless you are an avid Three Stooges fan, a Stooges ""completist"", and just have to have everything they have ever done.  I find little humor in the movie shorts here.  DISORDER IN THE COURT is probably the funniest.  Ted Healy's humor is not only outdated, but so corny!  What was the draw on this guy???  These are really early shorts before the Stooges took off on their own.  Read the other reviews for more on that.

Several of these shorts are nothing more than a ""catch-all"" way of using outtakes from other movies by combining them into these shorts.  ROAST BEEF AND MOVIES,  PLANE NUTS, and BIG IDEA all have dance routines by the MGM Dancing Girls which appear to be outtakes from early Busby Berkeley musicals although he is not mentioned in the credits.  These dance routines have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the so-called plots of these short subjects.  That's okay if you want to see very early Busby Berkeley routines (and who wouldn't?) but the fact is that they are filmed from a distance and you don't get much chance to see the girls close up.  The picture quality of the dance routines is not the best.

There's even a weird outtake of an Amos and Andy plot where one man does all of the voices from the radio program.

Some reviewers really liked this DVD but I say buy it with caution.",1475971200,,1400,4.396887159533074
7924752,5,B00004W1TA,"As we have all probably seen the Public Domain shorts  many times, the draw for me here is the Shemp solo and Ted Healy pre Columbia days films.  GREAT stuff",1407196800,,157,4.2

7924754,4,B00004W1TA,"This disc contains Roast Beef and Movies with Curly solo and the Healy/Stooges final short The Big Idea.
These two films are hard to find and well worth the price of this DVD.  The Shemp Vitaphone comedies are funny as well.  Highly recommended.",1358035200,,245,4.674418604651163
7924755,4,B00004W1TA,"Contained on this DVD are the shorts Moe, Larry and Curly did while with Ted Healy, a rare solo Curly short, and some Shemp shorts. Also included are the four public domain shorts of the Three Stooges that are generally found on other discs. The Ted Healy shorts are an interesting look at the very beginnings of the Three Stooges. Many of the jokes were redone after they left working with Healy. The only issue I have, is that ""Beer and Pretzels"" has been edited in at least two places. The full length short can be seen in ""The Lost Stooges"" narrative with Leonard Maltin. The Shemp shorts sees him paired with Jack Haley (the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz) and they are hilarious together. The Curly short teams him with two others and the chemistry doesn't work as well as when he is with Moe and Larry. However its good to see this film for nostagia sake. Overall, this is a good DVD that showcases the art of the Three Stooges and the comedic talent of Ted Healy.",1342742400,,968,4.3535911602209945

7924757,1,B00004W1TA,"Having recently seen the Warner Archives DVD of THE LOST STOOGES hosted by Leonard Maltin, I am interested in seeing as many of the non-Columbia shorts (and clips from features) as possible featuring the Stooges (both together, separately, and with Ted Healy). I nearly purchased the SHEMP COCKTAIL DVD until I found that it only contained 3 shorts that I hadn't seen, and those in very poor condition.

Can someone who has this collection list the shorts collected on this DVD?",1325116800,,478,4.901234567901234
7924758,5,B00004W1TA,"If you can find a used copy of this, snatch it up. Yes, we don't need more copies of DISORDER, BRIDELESS, MALICE and SING but that's not the reason to buy this. The other 8 shorts are rare and for some of them this is the only DVD release they have gotten or will get. Shemp solo shorts are especially hard to find.",1260230400,,315,4.015873015873016
7924759,2,B00004W1TA,"The four public domain shorts are good, but everywhere.

Ted Healy was incredibly UNfunny. He held the Stooges down.

When the Stooges left that jerk, they soared. Historicly interesting;Yes. Funny;No It's a small wonder Healy got stomped to death in a bar-room.",1094083200,4,262,5.214285714285714
7924760,3,B00004W1TA,"This DVD is great value for the price. Even more worthwhile if your interested in film history.
Four of these shorts are well known classics featuring either Curly or Shemp Howard as the third Stooge.
Some of the other shorts on this disc feature members of the Three Stooges in solo film before they came together as a team.
A couple feature the full Stooges line-up with Ted Healy.
I find the Ted Healy stuff very poor quality,but interesting if you are interested in seeing how their early vaudeville performance would have been like on stage.",1070928000,3,546,4.697916666666667
