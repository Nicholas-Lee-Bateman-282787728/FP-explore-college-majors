3174672,5,B0017OGOIA,"Censorship and bias by the left in academia is a subject,and a common reality,that is seldom given serious consideration by the media. Wonder why? ""Indoctrinate-U"",is much more than a clever title, a reality on many campuses for decades,the program's point is forcefully and graphically illustrated by way of student interviews: i.e. students who have experienced various forms of indoctrination and intimidation, direct and indirect, subtle and blatant, by other students, faculty,and administrators. I have experienced campus life prior to the 60's Counter Culture Revolution, and as a student and employee for over 40 years after the movement. Prior to the 60's movement,teacher-student dialogue was much more open with viewpoints that covered the entire ideological spectrum with total emphasis on course subject material. After the 60's,generally speaking,left of center views were increasingly introduced as people caring,""insightful"",""liberating"" and representative of ""progressive"" thought. Opposing views,were often thought to be medieval, bigoted and oppresive to human freedom. If the Campus is the training ground for tomorrows leaders - this reality should be considered tragic and totally unexceptable as it applies to educational standards and our nations future. I give ""Indoctrinate-U"" Five Stars for two reasons. One, because of the extremely serious nature of the subject matter and two, because this documentary is exceptionally well done.",1212019200,8,1459,5.919431279620853
3174673,4,B0017OGOIA,"I'll save the electrons and compose something shorter. I would have made this film differently. For me, the most powerful pieces are the true stories with a traditional narrative. Some small person unthinkingly does something to offend the powers-that-be, followed by Soviet style interrogation, threats and punishments. The Hinkle story, described in length above, moves from stupid to absurd so fast it is dizzying. It could make a film by itself. The Jackson 5 Halloween costumes also make you laugh and cry simultaneously. How could any school administration believe it has the authority to enforce ""right thinking"" among students in their free time? Once upon a time they hoped to control such things, but the absurdity and futility of it became evident over time. But now the busybodies who once enforced dress codes and chaperones now supervise attitudes about race, gender, and class. Terrifying. This is thought control indeed, exercised in precisely the place where today's teachers once rebelled violently against any such tendencies.

However, the editing annoyed me. The cuts from one person speaking one sentence to the next were frazzling. Let the guy speak! Instead I see student for one sentence, parent for one sentence, other parent, other sibling, student again, wham, wham, wham. Hard to develop an argument when you get one or two sentences max. And why all the students who had no particular story to tell, other than the generic ""You have to be on the left, or else!"" There were so many fascinating tales in here, briefly touched and then abandoned, that I was disappointed they were not developed further.

But yes, this is vital information that too many want to ignore. Sending your kid to college? Find out what they will be taught and how they  cannot question orthodoxy without imperiling their career. Griping about another open-handed begging spree by your state university system? Check out what they are doing with your money! The scenes where Evan looks for the Men's Studies building are hysterical. Much as we see in another current film, Expelled, the powers-that-be have labored mightily to exclude all alternative opinions, making their view the only one worthy of discussion. What was once discourse is now indoctrination.

DVD contains 2 deleted scenes that are both excellent and informative. I bet he had lots more stuff he could have included. Wish he had.",1208822400,47,2401,5.11734693877551
3174674,5,B0017OGOIA,"I was fortunate to get seats to a free screening of Indoctrinate U, a film both funny and shocking.  Before watching the film I was aware of speech codes on college campuses and the intimidation of students and professors who express certain view points, but I wasn't quite prepared for some of the things I saw in Evan Maloney's film.

For instance, take two incidents from University of Tennessee.  In one, five white fraternity boys dressed up as the Jackson Five for an off-campus Halloween party; when they returned to campus another student spotted them, took offense at their costumes, and reported them to administration.  They, along with their entire fraternity, were punished with suspension.  In another incident at the same school, a Sikh student wrote an opinion piece on increasing intellectual diversity in a committee that invites campus speakers; the committee would invite only people from the left of the political spectrum, and the student wanted to see more viewpoints expressed.  A member of this committee wrote an email referring to the Sikh student as a ""raghead"", a terrorist, and saying that he should be shot in the face.  Now... what do you think happened to the person who wrote this hateful, bigoted email that actually incites violence against another student? He was given a slap on the wrist, not allowed to attend a couple of campus events, but that was about it.  So basically, white students dressing up as the Jackson five are suspended; a guy writing a racist, threatening email against a conservative Sikh student suffers no serious disciplinary reprisals.

Speech codes and codes of expression and conduct implemented to protect people against getting hurt, offended or suffering from low self-esteem not only go against the first amendment, they are often selectively applied (as seen in above example).  And because these codes are so often poorly defined (so many things can fall under the category of offensive or hurtful), they can be used to silence people with undesirable viewpoints.  Instead of a climate of healthy debate and free expression, you have a climate of intellectual and ideological repression on many campuses across the U.S.  And this of course is ultimately terrible for the students, who aren't allowed opportunities to develop critical thinking skills.  For example, students and professors who support the left-wing views that prevail on campuses will never have their opinions challenged, will never test their ideas in arguments and debates - as such, their thinking will only become closed off and lazy (as seen by their tendency to call anyone who disagrees with them a racist, fascist, bigot...).  And students who want to challenge the dominant campus views will find it easier to remain silent and play along because of a fear of causing ""offense"" and facing disciplinary repercussions; they too miss out on chances to develop intellectually.

There are many examples in the film of this sort of bullying and intimidation of students and also professors.  Maloney interviews black professors who, because they question or oppose affirmative action, are often shunned by peers and considered ""not really black"" (a sentiment that's blatantly racist).  Then there's a psychology professor, well-liked by her students and having an excellent academic record, whose colleagues found out she was a Republican (not because she brought her politics into the classroom - in fact, she was one of the few professors who didn't - but because her colleagues learned that her husband, a local businessman, belonged to some Republican commerce committee).  Her department began to harass her by having her office constantly moved around and by messing up her schedule, and they informed her that she would not have been hired had they known she was a Republican.  She was removed as department chair, her family received threats, and a swastika was burned on her lawn.

In US campuses today you can face serious repercussions for perceived ""thought crimes"".  There's Steve Hinkle, a Cal Poly student who posted flyers announcing an upcoming talk by a black conservative author, Mason Weaver; the flyer had the author's name, picture, and title of the book, 'It's OK to Leave the Plantation'.  When Hinkle posted this in the school's multicultural center, some students found it offensive (because of the word 'plantation'), and this led to a series of disciplinary hearings for Hinkle, where he was asked to apologize, to see a psychologist, and was threatened with expulsion.  Hinkle wisely refused to back down and instead took Cal Poly to court, where the school's case unsurprisingly collapsed.  The school never apologized to Hinkle for jeopardizing his future and persecuting him.

I recommend this film to people of all political stripes (and race, and gender, and ethnic group, etc.) Whether you're a staunch Democrat or Republican, left or right-wing, the issues raised in Indoctrinate U are of great concern to anyone who wants universities to be places where ideas are freely exchanged, where debate is possible and students can develop and refine their viewpoints and hone their critical thinking skills.  Everyone is hurt by this sort of ideological and intellectual conformity, even the students and the large numbers of professors who adhere to the dominant viewpoints on campuses.  Parents and prospective or currently enrolled students should definitely take the time to watch, because even though the film's angle is to expose what's going on rather than provide examples on how to tackle and solve these issues, you see students and professors who do speak out and how they go about fighting intellectual repression.

In addition to the surprising and shocking content of the film, I have to say it's also a funny film too.  Maloney is able to mix serious issues with humor, and it's no wonder that the film has been such a hit among audiences who've seen it so far, including university students; the film's tone never gets preachy.  He interviews a number of students and professors from across the political spectrum and from campuses all around the US, and he also presents some visits he made to campus administrative offices.  His questions about diversity and school policies are often met by agitation and calls to campus security, which is particularly funny as Maloney is unfailingly polite, soft-spoken and non-threatening (at one point a security guard shows up at the diversity office to find him reading a magazine in the waiting area).  When administrators do speak to him, their replies are often circuitous and nonsensical, as with one man trying to avoid explaining how his office approved a flyer that compared a Kuwaiti student who wrote a pro-American essay to Hitler and a suicide bomber.

Maloney's film is important and necessary.  I hope it raises awareness of what goes on across the US on college campuses and starts a discussion of  how to fight for freedom of expression and healthy debate.",1208390400,101,6999,5.125769569041337
3174675,5,B0017OGOIA,"if michael moore had integrity, he would have made this movie.  this movie however does actually have that sense of humor and cutting insights you would normally find in a movie like roger & me, but I would say this subject is much more important and much more factually based.",1259193600,3,277,4.54
3174676,3,B0017OGOIA,"I watched ""Indoctrinate U"" ... and watched it, and watched it, and watched it.  The director/author telling the story of someone who got into trouble for saying something.  The person in question explaining what happened.  The director/author, camera trailing behind, attempting to find someone from the relevant university who can explain what happened from the university's perspective (e.g., threatening a student with expulsion for putting up a flier to promote a speech by a conservative African American author promoting a book that's called ""It's OK to Leave the Plantation"", the problem being that another student found herself ""offended"" by the word ""plantation"").  Then the d/a telling, person explaining, d/a attempting.  Again and again.  The point of the film is, of course, essentially a valid one, but I would have liked a bit less repetitiveness and much tighter editing.  I also have to add that I find myself of two minds about the matter at hand.  The film goes into some length about the fact that there are many universities in America at which a huge percentage of professors are registered Democrats, and hardly any are registered Republicans.  This makes me wonder.  If there is organized and institutionalized discrimination against conservative professors (and one of the key figures in Indoctrinate U is a female professor who undergoes simply astonishing harassment when she is outed as a Republican), then that is a problem.  But I cannot help also feeling that perhaps the majority are on the side of the angels, so to speak.  Perhaps a majority of people who undergo a thorough education from kindergarten through graduate and post-graduate work do come to a liberal understanding, at least in the sense that American sociopolitical debate defines liberal and conservative.  Next, the documentary makes much fun of speech codes at universities.  Here, again, I have to wonder.  Some of those that were presented in the video were woolly and nonsensical, indeed.  But it does seem to me that a university campus would not be a better place in any sense of the word if everyone were absolutely free to use the perjorative words which bigots apply to persons of color, gay people, persons of different ethnicities, etc.  If the aim is to make sure that no student is attacked for reasons of his or her basic existence, then that makes sense to me.  Of course, I also accept the point that is made in ""Indoctrinate U"" -- that this can go beyond ridiculousness, and if someone is ""offended"" enough by the word ""plantation"" to get another student almost booted out of school, that runs close to lunacy.  But societies do establish compacts, whether written or unwritten, of behavior, and speech is part thereof.  Every journalism student in the history of America has learned that freedom of speech is not an absolute concept.  The classic example given is the person who stands up and shouts ""fire"" in a crowded movie theater.  But I also do not feel that I or anyone should have the right to loudly describe black people as n*ggers, gay people as f*ggots, Italians as w*ps, Jews as k*kes, etc.  I cannot see a problem with a university proscribing such language.  Another key character in ""Indoctrinate U"" is an Indian student who writes a conservative editorial and is attacked by a fellow member of the university community as a ""raghead"" and a ""terrorist.""  The idea is that the student was attacked for being a conservative.  But would the same not be true if he had written a radically liberal editorial and someone had called him a ""raghead"" and a ""terrorist""?  Is it not simply a question of racist attack?  This is not an easy review to write, because I really do see the issue from both sides and believe that I would probably be pretty uncomfortable to see five white frat boys in blackface pretending to be the Jackson 5 (another key episode in the video), but I do think that ""Indoctrinate U"" is, in some ways, as close to the line of demagoguery as anything that Michael Moore has produced, particularly in the fairly lengthy episode in which the director/author goes on a search for ""men's studies"" departments at the various universities which he visits.  Perhaps this would have been less so if the director/author had also gone to any of America's self-defined ""Christian"" universities and taken a look at what happens to freedom of speech when eager-beaver conservativism gets its hands on it.  But then again, that might have been a different documentary -- albeit one with the same point.  ""Indoctrinate U"" -- interesting, but a bit too much.",1249171200,3,4589,4.920779220779221

3174679,4,B0017OGOIA,"This video tackles some very important and interesting questions.
Authors shows how politicized the higher education is. The biggest importance of this documentary is precisely with the fact that it exposes the myth of OBJECTIVITY as it's presented by the university professors.
I know it by experience. If you're not clever enough, and not prepared for the university [as vast majority of students are], you will easily be indoctrinated by your professors.
It is so true that professors get so far beyond what the curriculum [which itself is very often can be biased] has, to some political/ideological  questions to sort out students to see who supports whom. It is true that based on your position in relation to the instructor's position, you may very often, predict the treatment of your efforts/grades in the class. Of course in science/technology classes it is not that relevant. But in humanities/social sciences - you better be careful what you say.
Anyways, the double standard is there. Postmodernism, feminism, Darwinism, are undisputed dogmas. You better never raise questions if your preparedness does not mach instructor's knowledge and authority. Don't you dare to critique all encompassing 'socially constructed' framework built by postmodernists. You better know that sexual orientation is socially constructed, and as the matter of fact all your values are socially constructed. Otherwise, you will have problems.
This is so, because if values are socially constructed, why not reconstruct them to include .... [anything they want], for experiment's sake? Let's reconstruct 'gender identity'. Let's reconstruct what means 'human life' to justify abortions instead of teaching abstinence.
Via this sort of deconstructionism, they can now introduce 'new academic disciplines', like women studies or 'gay studies', or whatever else, despite the fact [as mentioned in the video] that males constitute 40 something percents of undergrads [minority that is].
The part of the documentary where author presents the ratio of democrats vs. republicans among faculty is telling.
To be honest, I'm not sure if I would classify myself in any of those two, but in the moral questions I am surely conservative. But in any case, universities [in US at least] should show intellectual diversity, or at least more even ratio.
It is extremely obvious that self proclaimed tolerant people are not tolerant at all, in the same way as ""Human Rights Campaign"" is not concerned with rights of all humans [it defends gays, transgenders, and similar groups]. It has to do with self-assigned label. They like to label themselves tolerant, but when Proposition 8 was under way in CA, anti-homosexual marriage signs were stolen and mutilated, cars were vandalized, to which all I am a witness. Make your own conclusions on that.
When it comes to banning of displaying American flag in America - is simply ridiculous. How can a American flag offend foreign students? This is beyond comprehension.

To summarize, this video in my mind will not revert the process of social experiment with minds of American youth. Not many will watch it, and those who will, will stay with their own pre-existing opinions anyways. However, it is informative and important for both concerned parents and kids who entering higher education. Both need to know that objectivity of education in many cases is illusory, because it is politicized, and influenced by may ideologies.",1240704000,4,3445,5.296160877513711

3174681,1,B0017OGOIA,"This documentary is nothing more than a whitewashed version of a deadly tale. Any movie or discussion that claims to be a history of Islam is not complete without mention of Muhammad's marriage to a six year old, without the fact that Muhammad fought in 27 wars during a ten year period and made his living by plundering and killing those who accompanied caravans or without exposing the violence in the Qur'an and the command to its followers that they ""convert the world to Islam by any means neccessary"" and to ""smite the infidel at his neck.""

I expected an unbiased account of Islam that would allow me to draw my own conclusions about Islam as a religion.  Instead, I was spoon fed pablum and honey.  Which by the way, happened to leave a bad taste in my mouth. Muhammad",1235433600,7,776,4.5285714285714285
3174682,4,B0017OGOIA,"I was fortunate enough to go to graduate school at a University that did not seem to have an ideology. Even in the political science department, where I studied, professors seemed to make an effort of keeping their biases (we all have them) out of the classroom, and studenst always felt free to write or speak from any angle without impugnity.

Many, however, are not so lucky. Professors often do not see themselves as teachers, but ones who profess certain viewpoints to captive audiences. Students are often intimidated to express any viewpoint deviating from the ""obviously correct"" liberal one, and ""diversity"" refers to ""diversity of anything BUT ideas.""

This is the unfortunate trend that Inductrinate U aptly chronicles. We see the faces and hear the voices of those affected by their universities' attempts to silence any viewpoint but the ""right"" one. We meet students threatened with expulsion for suggesting that affirmative action is wrong, that America has been a force for good once in a while, or even flying the American flag outside of their dorm room or office. We also meet professors who have experienced censure and reprobation from colleagues for the intellectual crime of being republicans (or even the suspicion of being a republican).

The film focuses much of its scorn on the concept, anathema to ""freedom of thought,"" of university ""speech codes."" That universities ban and censor everything from ""speech that might offend,"" to ""speech that might hurt self-esteem,"" would be hard to believe but for the fact that this film provides so many actual examples of the trend.

Part of Indoctrinate U's timeliness, in fact, comes from the fact that if the film did not chronicle this stuff so well, it would be almost impossible to believe that uniniversities and their faculty can be so childish! We watch faculty and students shout down guest speakers (it is easier to shout than debate), argue for the correctness of banning any speech  that offends (never applying this rule to their own ideas, of course), and create an atmosphere of ideological uniformity that is hard to fathom of the university campus.

Indoctrinate U also avoids a common pitfall of many documentaries made from a particular political ""angle:"" it never agitates towards a particular political view. While all of the examples from the film are of liberal censoring non-liberals, the viewer never gets the sense that the film is bringing up a ""conservative"" issue or is engaging in ""liberal bashing."" Instead, the filmmaker suggests over and over that the issue is not a liberal or conservative one, but is simply an issue that should concern anyone who desires freedom of thought at the university level.

For anyone interested in reaidng more on this issue, I reccomend Stanley Fish's recent book, ""Save the World on Your Own Time,"" which advocates that professors stick to their job of teaching and introducing concepts to students, rather than advocating certain ideas. Teachers, in other words, should be liberals (or conservatives) only in their personal lives. Excellent read (and Fish cites this film several times.)

Good film about a pressing and relevant issue.",1233964800,5,3170,5.1061776061776065

But whether one is liberal or conservative, students across the nation have been frustrated by the new emerging beauracratic ethos of political correctness and the use of the college classroom for indoctrination of students to a very narrow radical ""liberal"" perspective.  Maloney accurately points out that this new liberalism is actually not liberal at all but a new form of biggotry. This trend in Universities and Colleges has been unchallenged far too long for it's ignorance and hypocricy. The film reveals the insidious nature of this new biggotry of thought that haunts the campus of today. Maloney touches on an issue that has negatively effected conservatives, liberals, blacks, whites, queers you name it. The monopolizing of contemporary education toward an ironically intolerant form of post-modernism which arrogantly perceives  only itself as ""right"" has contributed to one-sided class discussions and the dumbing down of the nation as a whole.

As I watched this movie I had a feeling of great empathy for many in his film who attended college with great hope of intellectual stimulation and the idea that great minds would meet and speak...only to be labeled and shunned by the rest of my campus'.
The problem of course is that I am a liberal, who attended private Christian universities for my undergrad and masters program. My undergrad degree was in Psychology and Political Science. I know exactly what it is like to be the only person on a campus that is different; and is treated as such. In one criminal law class I was harassed for asking why we did not discuss ""justice"" and what it means. The answer to every question in class was the right-wing/ fundamentalist answer. When I had the audacity to suggest in class that we learn from a balanced perspective, it got heated between myself and the professor and I left early in tears; the entire class applauded when I left.
In another Poly Sci class I was told by one of the male students that I had ""better watch my back."" Please understand that I was a 40 something white, female, student.
My problem with this film is that he does not cover both sides of the issue. There are multitudes of universities that are just as far to the right as the examples used in his film are to the left. He forgot to mention that.
As any decent researcher knows, you must look at all the data and include all of the data that proves your theory wrong as well; not just the data that supports your claim.

3174692,5,B0017OGOIA,"Evan Coyne Maloney directed this documentary to explain in a humorous and sometimes shocking manner why many conservatives are calling for ""intellectual diversity"" on college campuses where liberals professors vastly outnumber conservative professors.  Currently on college campuses, conservative professors are often harrassed until they resign.  Meanwhile, conservative professors applying for teaching jobs are painfully aware that they must hide their views if they expect a job offer.  The result is a dearth of conservative professors in the liberal arts and an explosion of conservative professors in think-tanks and private enterprise.

As practiced by many universities, diversity is used to stanch the free expression of ideas and speech.  This documentary provides ample examples of innocuous statements by conservatives, which led to harrassment and intimidation by college administrators in contrast to the hate speech of some liberals, which were ignored by college administrators.

The movement to add ""intellectual diversity"" to the primitive tribal classifications of diversity as practiced by many colleges is the stated goal of the film's director and he does an admirable job proving his thesis.  Unsurprisingly, he provides plenty of air time for professors who are radical liberals, mainstream Democrats, libertarians, and conservatives with the expectation that the viewer will draw a conclusion from seeing this profusion of intellectual viewpoints.  I give the documentary 4.5 stars.",1214092800,29,1508,5.917050691244239

The unversity system is filled with banal little people who have no moral compunction with running roughshod over freedom of speech, as long as it serves their socialist agenda.  Ironic that it is these same types who were seizing University buildings in the 1960's who now call down campus police authority against anyone whom they don't agree with politically.  A pity that campus administrators weren't equally as quick to call in police against the '60's radicals who now run our universities.  One comes away from this documentary with two thoughts:  1) Do I really want to pay tens of thousands of dollars to subject my children to such an environment; and 2) What is going on in these universities that their administrators are so desperate to keep from public view?

Negatives:  Amatuerish production values, and the documentary length is fairly short.  This is regretable, but understandable, given the thug tactics that university administrators used against the producers.",1212624000,19,1079,5.337278106508876
3174694,3,B0017OGOIA,"This DVD portrays what it claims, I guess.  It was just that I thought when they said ""political"" I thought they meant university policy, not liberal vs. conservative.

Sure universities (faculty and staff) have moved and become primarily liberal, that seems where the general US resident is drawn once educated, except for the ones who are wealthy and have lost themselves in self-absorbed greed.  Not that conservativism is all bad; it's just that the ""super"" rich conservative coupled with their massive political and media influence has created a severe offset in the balance needed for stability.

Take for example the ""war on terror"" and the ""war on drugs.""  Both propagated by political and media sources as necessary for safety, security, and ""our children.""  However this couldn't be further from the truth, both are used to build a bigger government that caters to the bellyaching of powerful corporate interests.  Not only is this about money, this is about power and electability - where philosophical trickery tools such as ""appeal to fear"" and ""slippery slope"" are used to move voters by spinning the numbers and twisting the facts while promising to ""fix"" these self-generated illusions - just to get elected.

Now it's just that most researchers (professors included) realize the same thing.  If the tables were turned the other way and unevenly biased toward the liberal and causing serious problems in our society and economy these individuals would probably pull for the other side - since of course it seems there needs to be a balance if a democratic, capitalist society to flourish - we're losing that balance.",1212537600,8,1632,5.105263157894737

""Indoctrinate-U"",is much more than a clever title, a reality on many campuses for decades,the program's point is forcefully and graphically illustrated by way of student interviews: i.e. students who have experienced various forms of indoctrination and intimidation, direct and indirect, subtle and blatant, by other students, faculty,and administrators. I have experienced campus life prior to the 60's Counter Culture Revolution, and as a student and employee for over 40 years after the movement. Prior to the 60's movement,teacher-student dialogue was much more open with viewpoints that covered the entire ideological spectrum with total emphasis on course subject material. After the 60's,generally speaking,left of center views were increasingly introduced as people caring,""insightful"",""liberating"" and representative of ""progressive"" thought. Opposing views,were often thought to be medieval, bigoted and oppresive to human freedom.

3409170,4,B0017OGOIA,"I'll save the electrons and compose something shorter. I would have made this film differently. For me, the most powerful pieces are the true stories with a traditional narrative. Some small person unthinkingly does something to offend the powers-that-be, followed by Soviet style interrogation, threats and punishments. The Hinkle story, described in length above, moves from stupid to absurd so fast it is dizzying. It could make a film by itself. The Jackson 5 Halloween costumes also make you laugh and cry simultaneously. How could any school administration believe it has the authority to enforce ""right thinking"" among students in their free time? Once upon a time they hoped to control such things, but the absurdity and futility of it became evident over time. But now the busybodies who once enforced dress codes and chaperones now supervise attitudes about race, gender, and class. Terrifying. This is thought control indeed, exercised in precisely the place where today's teachers once rebelled violently against any such tendencies.

However, the editing annoyed me. The cuts from one person speaking one sentence to the next were frazzling. Let the guy speak! Instead I see student for one sentence, parent for one sentence, other parent, other sibling, student again, wham, wham, wham. Hard to develop an argument when you get one or two sentences max. And why all the students who had no particular story to tell, other than the generic ""You have to be on the left, or else!"" There were so many fascinating tales in here, briefly touched and then abandoned, that I was disappointed they were not developed further.

But yes, this is vital information that too many want to ignore. Sending your kid to college? Find out what they will be taught and how they  cannot question orthodoxy without imperiling their career. Griping about another open-handed begging spree by your state university system? Check out what they are doing with your money! The scenes where Evan looks for the Men's Studies building are hysterical. Much as we see in another current film, Expelled, the powers-that-be have labored mightily to exclude all alternative opinions, making their view the only one worthy of discussion. What was once discourse is now indoctrination.

DVD contains 2 deleted scenes that are both excellent and informative. I bet he had lots more stuff he could have included. Wish he had.",1208822400,47,2401,5.11734693877551
3409171,5,B0017OGOIA,"I was fortunate to get seats to a free screening of Indoctrinate U, a film both funny and shocking.  Before watching the film I was aware of speech codes on college campuses and the intimidation of students and professors who express certain view points, but I wasn't quite prepared for some of the things I saw in Evan Maloney's film.

For instance, take two incidents from University of Tennessee.  In one, five white fraternity boys dressed up as the Jackson Five for an off-campus Halloween party; when they returned to campus another student spotted them, took offense at their costumes, and reported them to administration.  They, along with their entire fraternity, were punished with suspension.  In another incident at the same school, a Sikh student wrote an opinion piece on increasing intellectual diversity in a committee that invites campus speakers; the committee would invite only people from the left of the political spectrum, and the student wanted to see more viewpoints expressed.  A member of this committee wrote an email referring to the Sikh student as a ""raghead"", a terrorist, and saying that he should be shot in the face.  Now... what do you think happened to the person who wrote this hateful, bigoted email that actually incites violence against another student? He was given a slap on the wrist, not allowed to attend a couple of campus events, but that was about it.  So basically, white students dressing up as the Jackson five are suspended; a guy writing a racist, threatening email against a conservative Sikh student suffers no serious disciplinary reprisals.

Speech codes and codes of expression and conduct implemented to protect people against getting hurt, offended or suffering from low self-esteem not only go against the first amendment, they are often selectively applied (as seen in above example).  And because these codes are so often poorly defined (so many things can fall under the category of offensive or hurtful), they can be used to silence people with undesirable viewpoints.  Instead of a climate of healthy debate and free expression, you have a climate of intellectual and ideological repression on many campuses across the U.S.  And this of course is ultimately terrible for the students, who aren't allowed opportunities to develop critical thinking skills.  For example, students and professors who support the left-wing views that prevail on campuses will never have their opinions challenged, will never test their ideas in arguments and debates - as such, their thinking will only become closed off and lazy (as seen by their tendency to call anyone who disagrees with them a racist, fascist, bigot...).  And students who want to challenge the dominant campus views will find it easier to remain silent and play along because of a fear of causing ""offense"" and facing disciplinary repercussions; they too miss out on chances to develop intellectually.

There are many examples in the film of this sort of bullying and intimidation of students and also professors.  Maloney interviews black professors who, because they question or oppose affirmative action, are often shunned by peers and considered ""not really black"" (a sentiment that's blatantly racist).  Then there's a psychology professor, well-liked by her students and having an excellent academic record, whose colleagues found out she was a Republican (not because she brought her politics into the classroom - in fact, she was one of the few professors who didn't - but because her colleagues learned that her husband, a local businessman, belonged to some Republican commerce committee).  Her department began to harass her by having her office constantly moved around and by messing up her schedule, and they informed her that she would not have been hired had they known she was a Republican.  She was removed as department chair, her family received threats, and a swastika was burned on her lawn.

In US campuses today you can face serious repercussions for perceived ""thought crimes"".  There's Steve Hinkle, a Cal Poly student who posted flyers announcing an upcoming talk by a black conservative author, Mason Weaver; the flyer had the author's name, picture, and title of the book, 'It's OK to Leave the Plantation'.  When Hinkle posted this in the school's multicultural center, some students found it offensive (because of the word 'plantation'), and this led to a series of disciplinary hearings for Hinkle, where he was asked to apologize, to see a psychologist, and was threatened with expulsion.  Hinkle wisely refused to back down and instead took Cal Poly to court, where the school's case unsurprisingly collapsed.  The school never apologized to Hinkle for jeopardizing his future and persecuting him.

I recommend this film to people of all political stripes (and race, and gender, and ethnic group, etc.) Whether you're a staunch Democrat or Republican, left or right-wing, the issues raised in Indoctrinate U are of great concern to anyone who wants universities to be places where ideas are freely exchanged, where debate is possible and students can develop and refine their viewpoints and hone their critical thinking skills.  Everyone is hurt by this sort of ideological and intellectual conformity, even the students and the large numbers of professors who adhere to the dominant viewpoints on campuses.  Parents and prospective or currently enrolled students should definitely take the time to watch, because even though the film's angle is to expose what's going on rather than provide examples on how to tackle and solve these issues, you see students and professors who do speak out and how they go about fighting intellectual repression.

In addition to the surprising and shocking content of the film, I have to say it's also a funny film too.  Maloney is able to mix serious issues with humor, and it's no wonder that the film has been such a hit among audiences who've seen it so far, including university students; the film's tone never gets preachy.  He interviews a number of students and professors from across the political spectrum and from campuses all around the US, and he also presents some visits he made to campus administrative offices.  His questions about diversity and school policies are often met by agitation and calls to campus security, which is particularly funny as Maloney is unfailingly polite, soft-spoken and non-threatening (at one point a security guard shows up at the diversity office to find him reading a magazine in the waiting area).  When administrators do speak to him, their replies are often circuitous and nonsensical, as with one man trying to avoid explaining how his office approved a flyer that compared a Kuwaiti student who wrote a pro-American essay to Hitler and a suicide bomber.

Maloney's film is important and necessary.  I hope it raises awareness of what goes on across the US on college campuses and starts a discussion of  how to fight for freedom of expression and healthy debate.",1208390400,101,6999,5.125769569041337

3409173,3,B0017OGOIA,"I watched ""Indoctrinate U"" ... and watched it, and watched it, and watched it.  The director/author telling the story of someone who got into trouble for saying something.  The person in question explaining what happened.  The director/author, camera trailing behind, attempting to find someone from the relevant university who can explain what happened from the university's perspective (e.g., threatening a student with expulsion for putting up a flier to promote a speech by a conservative African American author promoting a book that's called ""It's OK to Leave the Plantation"", the problem being that another student found herself ""offended"" by the word ""plantation"").  Then the d/a telling, person explaining, d/a attempting.  Again and again.  The point of the film is, of course, essentially a valid one, but I would have liked a bit less repetitiveness and much tighter editing.  I also have to add that I find myself of two minds about the matter at hand.  The film goes into some length about the fact that there are many universities in America at which a huge percentage of professors are registered Democrats, and hardly any are registered Republicans.  This makes me wonder.  If there is organized and institutionalized discrimination against conservative professors (and one of the key figures in Indoctrinate U is a female professor who undergoes simply astonishing harassment when she is outed as a Republican), then that is a problem.  But I cannot help also feeling that perhaps the majority are on the side of the angels, so to speak.  Perhaps a majority of people who undergo a thorough education from kindergarten through graduate and post-graduate work do come to a liberal understanding, at least in the sense that American sociopolitical debate defines liberal and conservative.  Next, the documentary makes much fun of speech codes at universities.  Here, again, I have to wonder.  Some of those that were presented in the video were woolly and nonsensical, indeed.  But it does seem to me that a university campus would not be a better place in any sense of the word if everyone were absolutely free to use the perjorative words which bigots apply to persons of color, gay people, persons of different ethnicities, etc.  If the aim is to make sure that no student is attacked for reasons of his or her basic existence, then that makes sense to me.  Of course, I also accept the point that is made in ""Indoctrinate U"" -- that this can go beyond ridiculousness, and if someone is ""offended"" enough by the word ""plantation"" to get another student almost booted out of school, that runs close to lunacy.  But societies do establish compacts, whether written or unwritten, of behavior, and speech is part thereof.  Every journalism student in the history of America has learned that freedom of speech is not an absolute concept.  The classic example given is the person who stands up and shouts ""fire"" in a crowded movie theater.  But I also do not feel that I or anyone should have the right to loudly describe black people as n*ggers, gay people as f*ggots, Italians as w*ps, Jews as k*kes, etc.  I cannot see a problem with a university proscribing such language.  Another key character in ""Indoctrinate U"" is an Indian student who writes a conservative editorial and is attacked by a fellow member of the university community as a ""raghead"" and a ""terrorist.""  The idea is that the student was attacked for being a conservative.  But would the same not be true if he had written a radically liberal editorial and someone had called him a ""raghead"" and a ""terrorist""?  Is it not simply a question of racist attack?  This is not an easy review to write, because I really do see the issue from both sides and believe that I would probably be pretty uncomfortable to see five white frat boys in blackface pretending to be the Jackson 5 (another key episode in the video), but I do think that ""Indoctrinate U"" is, in some ways, as close to the line of demagoguery as anything that Michael Moore has produced, particularly in the fairly lengthy episode in which the director/author goes on a search for ""men's studies"" departments at the various universities which he visits.  Perhaps this would have been less so if the director/author had also gone to any of America's self-defined ""Christian"" universities and taken a look at what happens to freedom of speech when eager-beaver conservativism gets its hands on it.  But then again, that might have been a different documentary -- albeit one with the same point.  ""Indoctrinate U"" -- interesting, but a bit too much.",1249171200,3,4589,4.920779220779221

3409176,4,B0017OGOIA,"This video tackles some very important and interesting questions.
Authors shows how politicized the higher education is. The biggest importance of this documentary is precisely with the fact that it exposes the myth of OBJECTIVITY as it's presented by the university professors.
I know it by experience. If you're not clever enough, and not prepared for the university [as vast majority of students are], you will easily be indoctrinated by your professors.
It is so true that professors get so far beyond what the curriculum [which itself is very often can be biased] has, to some political/ideological  questions to sort out students to see who supports whom. It is true that based on your position in relation to the instructor's position, you may very often, predict the treatment of your efforts/grades in the class. Of course in science/technology classes it is not that relevant. But in humanities/social sciences - you better be careful what you say.
Anyways, the double standard is there. Postmodernism, feminism, Darwinism, are undisputed dogmas. You better never raise questions if your preparedness does not mach instructor's knowledge and authority. Don't you dare to critique all encompassing 'socially constructed' framework built by postmodernists. You better know that sexual orientation is socially constructed, and as the matter of fact all your values are socially constructed. Otherwise, you will have problems.
This is so, because if values are socially constructed, why not reconstruct them to include .... [anything they want], for experiment's sake? Let's reconstruct 'gender identity'. Let's reconstruct what means 'human life' to justify abortions instead of teaching abstinence.
Via this sort of deconstructionism, they can now introduce 'new academic disciplines', like women studies or 'gay studies', or whatever else, despite the fact [as mentioned in the video] that males constitute 40 something percents of undergrads [minority that is].
The part of the documentary where author presents the ratio of democrats vs. republicans among faculty is telling.
To be honest, I'm not sure if I would classify myself in any of those two, but in the moral questions I am surely conservative. But in any case, universities [in US at least] should show intellectual diversity, or at least more even ratio.
It is extremely obvious that self proclaimed tolerant people are not tolerant at all, in the same way as ""Human Rights Campaign"" is not concerned with rights of all humans [it defends gays, transgenders, and similar groups]. It has to do with self-assigned label. They like to label themselves tolerant, but when Proposition 8 was under way in CA, anti-homosexual marriage signs were stolen and mutilated, cars were vandalized, to which all I am a witness. Make your own conclusions on that.
When it comes to banning of displaying American flag in America - is simply ridiculous. How can a American flag offend foreign students? This is beyond comprehension.

To summarize, this video in my mind will not revert the process of social experiment with minds of American youth. Not many will watch it, and those who will, will stay with their own pre-existing opinions anyways. However, it is informative and important for both concerned parents and kids who entering higher education. Both need to know that objectivity of education in many cases is illusory, because it is politicized, and influenced by may ideologies.",1240704000,4,3445,5.296160877513711

3409179,4,B0017OGOIA,"I was fortunate enough to go to graduate school at a University that did not seem to have an ideology. Even in the political science department, where I studied, professors seemed to make an effort of keeping their biases (we all have them) out of the classroom, and studenst always felt free to write or speak from any angle without impugnity.

Many, however, are not so lucky. Professors often do not see themselves as teachers, but ones who profess certain viewpoints to captive audiences. Students are often intimidated to express any viewpoint deviating from the ""obviously correct"" liberal one, and ""diversity"" refers to ""diversity of anything BUT ideas.""

This is the unfortunate trend that Inductrinate U aptly chronicles. We see the faces and hear the voices of those affected by their universities' attempts to silence any viewpoint but the ""right"" one. We meet students threatened with expulsion for suggesting that affirmative action is wrong, that America has been a force for good once in a while, or even flying the American flag outside of their dorm room or office. We also meet professors who have experienced censure and reprobation from colleagues for the intellectual crime of being republicans (or even the suspicion of being a republican).

The film focuses much of its scorn on the concept, anathema to ""freedom of thought,"" of university ""speech codes."" That universities ban and censor everything from ""speech that might offend,"" to ""speech that might hurt self-esteem,"" would be hard to believe but for the fact that this film provides so many actual examples of the trend.

Part of Indoctrinate U's timeliness, in fact, comes from the fact that if the film did not chronicle this stuff so well, it would be almost impossible to believe that uniniversities and their faculty can be so childish! We watch faculty and students shout down guest speakers (it is easier to shout than debate), argue for the correctness of banning any speech  that offends (never applying this rule to their own ideas, of course), and create an atmosphere of ideological uniformity that is hard to fathom of the university campus.

Indoctrinate U also avoids a common pitfall of many documentaries made from a particular political ""angle:"" it never agitates towards a particular political view. While all of the examples from the film are of liberal censoring non-liberals, the viewer never gets the sense that the film is bringing up a ""conservative"" issue or is engaging in ""liberal bashing."" Instead, the filmmaker suggests over and over that the issue is not a liberal or conservative one, but is simply an issue that should concern anyone who desires freedom of thought at the university level.

For anyone interested in reaidng more on this issue, I reccomend Stanley Fish's recent book, ""Save the World on Your Own Time,"" which advocates that professors stick to their job of teaching and introducing concepts to students, rather than advocating certain ideas. Teachers, in other words, should be liberals (or conservatives) only in their personal lives. Excellent read (and Fish cites this film several times.)

Maloney accurately points out that this new liberalism is actually not liberal at all but a new form of biggotry. This trend in Universities and Colleges has been unchallenged far too long for it's ignorance and hypocricy.

The problem of course is that I am a liberal, who attended private Christian universities for my undergrad and masters program. My undergrad degree was in Psychology and Political Science. I know exactly what it is like to be the only person on a campus that is different; and is treated as such. In one criminal law class I was harassed for asking why we did not discuss ""justice"" and what it means. The answer to every question in class was the right-wing/ fundamentalist answer. When I had the audacity to suggest in class that we learn from a balanced perspective, it got heated between myself and the professor and I left early in tears; the entire class applauded when I left.
In another Poly Sci class I was told by one of the male students that I had ""better watch my back."" Please understand that I was a 40 something white, female, student.

It's about 100 times better than I thought it would be. A lot of it is unintentionally hilarious but tragic as well. What a sad state our universities are in. The segment on speech codes was magnificent as was the one concerning the Cal Poly student who got put on trial for posting a flier for a black conservative speaker. The treatment Ward Connerly received was horrific but all too typical. Without them our institutions would be an utter gulag.

Thank God that FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) exists. Give this one a look. You'll be entertained, infuriated, and inspired.",1221868800,8,1149,4.989583333333333
3409186,1,B0017OGOIA,"This movie almost seemed interesting. Then the host asked someone at a college women's studies department where the men's studies department was like he was proving some kind of point. All history is men's history that is why they had to make women's history and African American history. I'm not a big fan of affirmative action but it can be helpful sometimes. There is a cultural perspective embedded deep within our social consciousness from years of repression. The majority of people still have a negative view of women and African Americans, many women accept their repressed state. African American people may feel hopeless. Affirmative action may be necessary to change our perceptions, boost confidence, and eliminate the embedded notions our world doesn't even realize they hold.",1220227200,5,789,5.26984126984127
3409187,5,B0017OGOIA,"This documentary is fun and sassy--not mean-spirited or angry.  This ""explicit version"" means that there are a few swear words said audibly and that the camera is flipped off.  I liked the editing.  He didn't beat the dead horse--he made his point elegantly then moved on.  Unlike Michael Moore, Maloney lets the honest, open narratives speak for themselves--he has faith in his audience to ""get"" it.  Maloney is right: fear and anger create more fear and anger.  Respectful, rational discussion creates understanding and relationship--which creates goodwill and excellence.",1217376000,7,574,5.465909090909091
3409188,5,B0017OGOIA,"I'm amazed at the censorship that our tax dollars are buying our children at universities today. Once a bastion of free speech, now colleges are determined to become a place of intolerance of any non-liberal perspective. The Hinkle story is unbelievable! I can't even fathom what he must have went through for simply posting a flyer inviting a conservative author to speak on campus. This film is for any college bound student or parent considering sending thier children to a university. Speech codes are ruining our children's ability to be creative and outpsoken in intellectual pursuits. We will be worse off as a nation because of these speech codes and other Stalinesque programs designed to get every student to conform to extreme leftist, marxist views shared by most professors. What a sad day in American education. On the other hand I am encouraged that Maloney had the fortitude to make this film and that several liberal professors weren't afraid to comment on camera and admit that intellectual honesty is becoming scarce even in thier own classrooms. This is a must see. Buy extra copies and pass them out to students and parents alike. My friend bought one for me and I will surely pass a copy on to someone else.",1215993600,11,1229,4.857142857142857
3409189,5,B0017OGOIA,"Evan Coyne Maloney directed this documentary to explain in a humorous and sometimes shocking manner why many conservatives are calling for ""intellectual diversity"" on college campuses where liberals professors vastly outnumber conservative professors.  Currently on college campuses, conservative professors are often harrassed until they resign.  Meanwhile, conservative professors applying for teaching jobs are painfully aware that they must hide their views if they expect a job offer.  The result is a dearth of conservative professors in the liberal arts and an explosion of conservative professors in think-tanks and private enterprise.

As practiced by many universities, diversity is used to stanch the free expression of ideas and speech.  This documentary provides ample examples of innocuous statements by conservatives, which led to harrassment and intimidation by college administrators in contrast to the hate speech of some liberals, which were ignored by college administrators.

The movement to add ""intellectual diversity"" to the primitive tribal classifications of diversity as practiced by many colleges is the stated goal of the film's director and he does an admirable job proving his thesis.  Unsurprisingly, he provides plenty of air time for professors who are radical liberals, mainstream Democrats, libertarians, and conservatives with the expectation that the viewer will draw a conclusion from seeing this profusion of intellectual viewpoints.  I give the documentary 4.5 stars.",1214092800,29,1508,5.917050691244239
3409190,3,B0017OGOIA,"Positives:  A chilling insight into the stalinist-like beauracracy on University Campii today.  The unversity system is filled with banal little people who have no moral compunction with running roughshod over freedom of speech, as long as it serves their socialist agenda.  Ironic that it is these same types who were seizing University buildings in the 1960's who now call down campus police authority against anyone whom they don't agree with politically.  A pity that campus administrators weren't equally as quick to call in police against the '60's radicals who now run our universities.  One comes away from this documentary with two thoughts:  1) Do I really want to pay tens of thousands of dollars to subject my children to such an environment; and 2) What is going on in these universities that their administrators are so desperate to keep from public view?

Negatives:  Amatuerish production values, and the documentary length is fairly short.  This is regretable, but understandable, given the thug tactics that university administrators used against the producers.",1212624000,19,1079,5.337278106508876
3409191,3,B0017OGOIA,"This DVD portrays what it claims, I guess.  It was just that I thought when they said ""political"" I thought they meant university policy, not liberal vs. conservative.

Sure universities (faculty and staff) have moved and become primarily liberal, that seems where the general US resident is drawn once educated, except for the ones who are wealthy and have lost themselves in self-absorbed greed.  Not that conservativism is all bad; it's just that the ""super"" rich conservative coupled with their massive political and media influence has created a severe offset in the balance needed for stability.

Take for example the ""war on terror"" and the ""war on drugs.""  Both propagated by political and media sources as necessary for safety, security, and ""our children.""  However this couldn't be further from the truth, both are used to build a bigger government that caters to the bellyaching of powerful corporate interests.  Not only is this about money, this is about power and electability - where philosophical trickery tools such as ""appeal to fear"" and ""slippery slope"" are used to move voters by spinning the numbers and twisting the facts while promising to ""fix"" these self-generated illusions - just to get elected.

Now it's just that most researchers (professors included) realize the same thing.  If the tables were turned the other way and unevenly biased toward the liberal and causing serious problems in our society and economy these individuals would probably pull for the other side - since of course it seems there needs to be a balance if a democratic, capitalist society to flourish - we're losing that balance.",1212537600,8,1632,5.105263157894737
8266698,5,B0017OGOIA,"Just the tip of the Iceberg.

'Indoctrinate U' provides a Chilling look at a place where MISANDRY - the Hatred of Men & Boys, Masculinity & Normal Heterosexuality is The Tenure Track in the pathetic farce of Academentia, where some 'feminist men' are also allowed to crawl along - provided they admit guilt on behalf of the whole Male Gender.

At UC-BS in Goleta, Santa Barbara County - the Official Published University Policy is that ""Gang Rape Represents Normal Male Sexuality, the Abuse of Womyn for Fun"" - and the student newspaper runs stories with pictures of caucasian males with pigs growing out of their foreheads and the caption: ""I am a lying sexist, Cut open my head, Drag out the Pig, and Butcher It"".

The UCSB policy includes enforcement actions using the Campus Gaystapo Thought Police (real ones with badges and guns) to go in to the community at large and Secretly - Contact / Complain / Demand Punishment and Silencing from the employers of anyone who dares to criticize such Misandry - and the Courts Approve (albeit in Un-Citable / Decisions whose contents remain Hidden from Public View).

Indoctrinate U - gets high marks for effort and Originality - as it is one of the very few documentaries to even attempt to discuss the Heavy Partisan Indoctrination that passes for 'education' - and Bars the Door to anyone who fails to conform to their 'Pander or Perish' Agenda. Many of the Professoriate are of the same ilk as those who stage the annual tax subsidized Anti-Male Hate Riot in Frisco, formerly celebrated (like 'Take Back the Night') but Now Heavily Censored by the lamesteam media.

8266704,5,B0017OGOIA,"I believe that history serves to reinforce stereotypes and socio-economic status by repeating over and over again how certain people are treated by the prevailing authority of their times. At the beginning of the film there was a point made that subconscious discrimination and segregation occurs when certain minority groups are given advantages of which the dominant culture is envious. Featured in the film was the quashing of attempts to expose this problem by suppressing freedom of speech.

This film was intriguing at first because of the way people refused to hear both sides of arguments, but the longer I watched I gradually realized that it's a lament for a philosophy that has no real argument on which to stand with only one exception, that conservatives, no matter their inability to change their minds, at least deserve to be heard for the sake of novelty.

After endless debate for decades between concervatism and liberalism, the truth is that reason and logic over the years brought the current balance of ideology to college campuses. There is a reason why there is such a skewed balance in favor of liberalism and against conservatism on college campuses, and it's called the natural evolution of human intellect toward successful survival of the species through equitable sharing of resources and equlity of status.

All that are left are those who refuse to adapt to changing times. There's a word for people who cling to the old ways, who find comfort in traditions such as gender defined roles in society with restrictions and privileges, a name for people who feel it's unfair to pay more taxes because they earn more money than other people.

This film is a fascinating look at the coservative perspective. It's main argument was that conservative speech is being suppressed on campus which is a serious issue. Any campus worth its claim to higher intellect should not supress any form of speech or falsely label it as harassment, but most people on campus are frankly sick and tired of hearing from conservatives.",1306886400,4,2040,4.991176470588235

Overall, this documentary illustrates what has been an ever-growing dictatorial control professors exercise over their students to indoctrinate political/social doctrines even in classes, such as astronomy, where such discussion is irrelevant and inappropriate. It is no wonder the last couple of generations of college graduates have little ability in the area of critical thinking.
