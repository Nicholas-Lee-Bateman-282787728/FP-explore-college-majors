3902658,4,B002C2KB12,"Many will complain about the lack of originality in ""Delgo."" Indeed, it's an archetypal fantasy story about a young, reckless hero, a wise elder, a damsel in distress, a wicked conqueror, and above all, a battle between good and evil. The only thing about this film that's original is the look, with typically medieval settings pushed aside in favor of a completely fictional, computer-generated alien planet called Jhamora. The characters are anything but human; they're divided into the amphibious Lokni people, the winged Nohrins, and an assortment of other strange beings that would pass for animals on our world. The pallet reminded me of the colors you'd see swirling on the surface of a soap bubble, bold shades of purple and green and blue with hints of red and orange. The visuals of this movie are so thoroughly extra-terrestrial that I find it hard to criticize them. I thought they were great to look at.

As for the story, yes, it follows a very well established formula to a tee. But did anyone complain about the lack of originality in ""Star Wars,"" which was also about a young, reckless hero, a wise elder, and everything else I listed earlier? What about the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga? Or ""The Chronicles of Narnia""? Or ""Beowulf""? Poking holes in an archetypal story is pointless, in my opinion. If you don't agree, then you probably never liked such stories to begin with. All I know is that ""Delgo"" achieves exactly what it wanted to achieve, and because of that, I was able to look past its shortcomings and just enjoy it for what it was. The only thing I wondered about was how long ago it was made; it features a vocal performance by Anne Bancroft, who died in 2005. It seems a little odd that this movie was delayed for so long.

The setup: Long ago, when Nohirn lands became inhospitable, King Zahn (voiced by Louis Gossett, Jr.) made an agreement to share land with the Loknis. It wasn't long before tensions grew, the Nohrins claiming more land than was necessary. Then Zahn's power-hungry sister, Sedessa (voiced by Bancroft), launched an unnecessary attack against the Loknis, many of which were slaughtered. She then planned the murder of Zahn, his wife, and his infant daughter; she was caught before she could finish the job, which led to her being banished and having her wings cut off. The Loknis and the Nohrins formed a very shaky truce after that, forming a border that neither species is allowed to cross over.

The story proper: We meet a teenage Lokni named Delgo (voiced by Freddy Prinze, Jr.), whose parents died when Sedessa attacked his village many years ago. Ever since then, he's been living with Elder Marley (voiced by Michael Clark Duncan), a Zen-like master with mystical powers whose speaks almost entirely in proverbs. As hard as he tries to train Delgo with mind exercises, Delgo is stubborn, careless, and intolerant of the Nohrins. One day, while spending time near the border, he meets the headstrong Princess Kyla (voiced by Jennifer Love Hewitt). While there's an immediate attraction, there's also hostility, and it's made worse when Kyla's escorts--Raius (voiced by Malcolm McDowell) and Bogardus (voiced by Val Kilmer), both in Zahn's army--attack Delgo for making a wrong move.

Raius is secretly in cahoots with Sedessa, who's plotting to steal the throne away from her brother. This involves kidnapping Kyla and blaming Delgo for it, which in turn will start a war between the Nohrins and the Loknis. In order to save both Kyla and their peoples, Delgo and Bogardus reluctantly form an alliance; hopefully, they can put aside their differences long enough to stop Sedessa and prevent Zahn from launching the first attack.

No archetypal story would be complete without some comedy relief. On the Lokni side, there's Delgo's best friend, Filo (voiced by Chris Kattan), who sounds like a tweaker on a bad amphetamine high. On the Nohrin side, there's Sedessa's servant, Spig (voiced by Eric Idle), a bumbling dragon-like creature. Neither one adds much to the story, but then again, that's not what comedy relief is for. Filo and Spig provide the audience with a break from the action, and nothing more.

If what I've said hasn't piqued your interest, then it's probably best you avoid this movie. As I've already said, ""Delgo"" gives us nothing new in the way of story or character; with the exception of the visuals, it's about as formulaic as it gets. I'm recommending it mostly because it delivers at a basic level--you want a tried and true fantasy, you've got a tried and true fantasy. Some may not appreciate the animation, and I agree that it wasn't as polished as it could have been. Still, I've seen worse-looking CGI characters (""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" comes to mind). Ultimately, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice by expecting anything more from ""Delgo"" than what it promises. It functions in much the same way as a children's bedtime story: It's enjoyable even though it's been told to us time and time again. Consistency is always more comforting than originality. There may come a time when we will want a new story, but until then, we have movies like ""Delgo"" to keep us entertained.",1229644800,43,5172,4.845022624434389

3902699,2,B002C2KB12,"This movie is a curiosity of sorts.  It's no Hollywood production, but rather, was an independent film created as a labor of love by an animation team operating outside the traditional Hollywood system, who had huge dreams of creating the next hot animated film and spent almost a decade putting their magnum opus together.  Sadly, while they poured millions into creating and distributing the film, they failed to advertise it, which resulted in it setting the record for worst opening weekend of all time for a wide-release film (a title it later lost to ""The Oogieloves,"" though it's still the worst-grossing all-CGI film of all time).  Ironically, the attention the film gathered by seizing that dubious record is the first time many people, including myself, heard of it, and the resulting snark-bait and negative attention probably served to advertise the film better than an actual marketing campaign could.  Um... good job, I guess?

While it was the no-such-thing-as-bad publicity that made this film catch my eye, I was genuinely curious to see if it was as bad as some of the naysayers said.  My verdict... while certainly not the WORST movie of all time or even the worst animated movie of all time, it's not necessarily good either.  And it makes me wonder just where that decade of hard work went.

""Delgo"" takes place on the world of Jhamora, and follows two fantasy races -- the primitive, peaceful Lokni and the winged warrior-race Nohrin -- who find themselves at war thanks to the scheming of Sedessa, sister to the King of the Nohrin.  Said war results in Sedessa's banishment, an uneasy truce between the warring factions, and the deaths of the parents of the title character Delgo, who's raised by his people's shamans and grows up bitter and hateful of the Nohrin.  Despite his anger, he ends up befriending Kyla, the Nohrin princess, and the two find themselves falling slowly in love.  But Sedessa isn't done with her schemes, and with the help of an army of ogre-like creatures and a scheming officer in the Nohrin army, she puts a plan into motion to reignite the war and seize the throne.  It falls on Delgo, his wise-cracking best friend Filo, and a disgraced Nohrin general to thwart Sedessa, rescue Kyla, and bring an end to the war before it results in the destruction of both their kingdoms forever.

Perhaps this film's greatest strength is its designs for the world and creatures.  It's obvious a lot of thought went into the creature and world designs, and I enjoyed the unique animals and artifacts of the world of Jhamora.  It's a little disappointing to see that the only differences between the Lokni and the Nohrin seem to be that one race has wings and hair and the other doesn't, as the designers could have gotten REALLY creative with the alien designs.  Perhaps they were afraid that straying too far from a ""human"" design would be off-putting to audiences?  I'm not sure.

Despite the creativity of the world, the story itself is loaded with clichs.  We have the two races at war, the star-crossed lovers, the villainous sibling of the king plotting a takeover (though at least this time it's the sister and not the brother making the power grab), the orphan hero, the rebellious princess...  I don't mind an old story if it's being told in a new way, but this film seems to think the alien setting is all it needs to give the story a twist.  And it seems content to pile clich story elements on top of each other, without making them fit together well or even coherently -- there's a LOT going on in this story, but its connected so haphazardly that it makes the plot needlessly convoluted instead of deliciously complex as the filmmakers were probably going for.

The characters, too, are little more than stereotypes and clichs, and even when they try to break those clichs they fail.  Delgo is shooting for the hot-headed but likable hero, but the filmmakers focus so much on the ""hotheaded"" part that they fail at the ""likable,"" and I found myself wanting to smack him instead of root for him.  Kyla is your typical rebellious princess, but rather than being to hold her own she ends up being next to useless except as a plot device.  The comic relief characters -- Filo and one of Sedessa's henchmen -- are far more annoying than amusing, and in the case of Filo you find yourself hoping he gets himself killed just to put the viewer out of their misery.  Everyone else -- the noble king, the wise elders, the scheming villainess -- are little more than walking cardboard cutouts, and unmemorable to the point where I'm hard-pressed to remember most characters' names.

The movie is loaded with big-name actors, or at least names that were big at one time -- Freddie Prince Jr., Jennifer Love Hewitt, Kelly Ripa, Burt Reynolds, Malcolm McDowell, Eric Idle, Anne Bancroft, Chris Kattan, etc. -- but for the most part all these big names seem to be phoning in their performances, or at worst sound bored out of their minds.  Only Anne Bancroft, who died three years before the film's release, seems to be enjoying herself, playing the role of Sedessa with obvious relish.  Then again, if you're voicing an over-the-top villain and you're not having fun, you're probably doing it wrong...

The filmmakers seem to pride themselves on the film's exemplary animation... but the film's animation is stiff at best, looking more like a video game cutscene than a big-budget animated film.  Characters expressions are limited, hair seems to be completely immobile, and poses and movements are stiff and awkward.  The worst example of this limited animation is during a stampede scene, when it's painfully obvious that each creature is the exact same animation model making the exact same movements as the others.  I understand that animation work began on this movie in 2001, so of course it would look slightly dated, but movies such as ""Toy Story,"" ""Shrek,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" and ""Monsters Inc."" all came out in or prior to 2001 and have animation that soundly beats ""Delgo.""  And when ""Delgo"" came out the same year as widely-acclaimed CGI movies ""Kung Fu Panda"" and ""WALL-E,"" both with phenomenal animation... the difference in quality really shows.

While I can't fault the filmmakers for wanting to make a CGI passion project of their own, for them to hail it as the next big thing in animation was a bit of a stretch, to say the very least.  It's not actively terrible enough to make you hate it, nor does it cross into so-bad-it's-hilarious territory, but it's certainly unmemorable and would have quickly been relegated to obscurity had it not been for its record-breaking-in-the-worst-way opening weekend.  As it is, it's a bargain-bin film that's virtually indistinguishable from a lot of straight-to-DVD fare, and while you could certainly do worse when picking an animated fantasy, you can certainly do better, too.  Skip this one.",1455062400,,6884,4.822278911564626

Its storytelling, characters, computer graphic images, everything needs much improvement.

""Delgo"" is a CG-animated feature. The fantasy adventure film starts with a brief but confusing account of the history of two conflicting tribes - the Lokni and the Nohrin - and their fragile truce after the war. Our hero, a young Lokni named Delgo (voiced by Freddie Prinze Jr.) meets Nohrin princess Kyla (voiced by Jennifer Love Hewitt) and they are attracted to each other.

Meanwhile, Sedessa (voiced by Anne Bancroft), banished by Nohrin King Zahn (voiced by Louis Gossett, Jr.) fifteen years ago, schemes to seize power by creating unrest between the Lokni and the Nohrin again. Delgo is the only one who can stop her plan.

The story of ""Delgo"" (which predates ""Avator"") is OK. It is serviceable, if not memorable. But the unfocused narrative is often confusing with poor editing and too many characters. What is worse is ""Delgo"" relies on comic stereotypes. Delgo's bumbling sidekick Filo (voiced by Chris Kattan) irritates us in Jar Jar Binks fashion.

As animation, ""Delgo"" is disappointing. Beautifully rendered background graphics aside, I find little that I can recommend. The characters movement is clunky (and not intentionally or amusingly so), and though some players did fine work (especially Anne Bancroft, her final film), most characters' voices lack personality and emotion.

Finally ""Delgo"" is known for its box-office failure, which, I think, is more due to the lack of promotion than to the film's quality. Still, they should have realized something is wrong with the project from the beginning: script, casting and animation. You don't need ""name"" actors to make a decent animated film. You need more appealing characters and more interesting story.",1285286400,2,1991,5.151702786377709
3902767,3,B002C2KB12,"Boy this is a tough one to review.  I went into it with low expectations (there are many critiques out there and none too shy about bashing it), came away mildly amused, and now in recollection, can't really determine just whom this film is designed to reach.  But before I get into the pros and cons of the picture itself, let's take a moment to talk about how it came into being.

The film was the product of Fathom Studios, a subsidiary of Macquarium.  Headquartered in Atlanta Georgia, Macquarium is an internet solutions consultancy company.  So in other words, this is a motion picture that bypasses traditional Hollywood studio backing/ financing.  The DVD is actually distributed by powerhouse 20th Century Fox but the film itself is essentially an indie project through and through.

The story, which could be easily be classified as high fantasy along the lines of say Lord of the Rings or Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal tells of two races who inhabit a vividly colorful realm: The Lokni and the Nohrin.

The Lokni are ground dwelling greenish humanoids (of which title character Delgo (Freddie Prinz Jr.) happens to be) while the Nohrin are a bit more fairy-esque with clear wings and a bit of a penchant for conflict.

It turns out the lands that the Nohrin come from have become increasingly inhospitable and the King Zahn (Louis Gossett Jr.) was able to make a deal with the Lokni to settle in their crowded land.

Tensions rise to the point of war between the two races and Delgo, an adventurous dreamer but naive teenager, finds himself in a position of having to prove to his people that peace can prevail amidst the feuding.

Suffice to say, my summary of the events taking place in this film is about as simplified as I can possibly make it considering the abundance of narration over exposition contained here.  In that sense it's a bit like Star Wars Episode I in that the plot itself really isn't anything too original or deep but the cobbled nature in which the material is presented makes it appear more complex than it really is.

A lot of people seem to complain about the animation/ character rendering and in all honesty, it may be in a tier below the visual feasts we've come to expect from studios like Pixar and DreamWorks, it's certainly passable and at times, pretty engrossing.

It's the script and the characters that begin to unravel what could have been a pretty decent contender in the CG game.  Freddy Prinz Jr.'s performance in the lead is okay, Val Kilmer does a nice job as the rogue, and even Burt Reynolds manages to deliver but Chris Kattan's rambunctious performance as Delgo's sidekick Filo is enough to drive anyone over the age of three absolutely bonkers!  Yes it's clear the character was incorporated for comic relief much in the way Jar Jar Binks was integrated into Episode: 1.  In both instances- fail!  Annoying and funny are quite different after a certain age.

I suspect the biggest flaw here though is that the computer generated animated feature films simply must understand its intended audience every step of the way.  It's young kids who line up to see these flicks and until young kids are allowed to drive by themselves, it's parents and guardians who will be paying for the ticket and sitting next to them.

Disney gets this, DreamWorks gets this and so do Pixar, Blue Sky, Sony Imageworks and the like.  Delgo, however, seems to be quite unsure of who this film will appeal to.  It's PG rating is well deserved as characters die, are murdered and so on.  The plot is far too complicated and slowly paced to keep the attention of real little ones but the attempts at humor are far too over-the-top to appeal to anyone old enough to make sense of the story.

It's a shame really that I can't rate this higher than average because I'm a subscriber to the theory that computer generated features are the great equalizer in the film industry.  There are literally tools used by the pros available freely to the public... A good story and some artistic skill could turn any aspiring animator into an internet sensation (whereas years ago when hand-drawn 2D was the epitome, very few had access to the tools).

Even still Delgo is an entirely middle of the road effort with a surprisingly impressive voice cast.  I am sure it would have faired better if, like other indie projects Happily N'ever After and Hoodwinked, it put more emphasis on being funny and charming rather than aiming to be a modern epic.",1284595200,9,4466,4.691025641025641

There are no complicated plot twist, nor those adult double entendres parents laugh it and later have to explain to their kids. It is a tolerable watch for adults. The movie is love, fantasy, and adventure. It copies scenes from other successful movies, such as the swinging cage from Time Bandits, and Gandolf's escape from the Tower.

The planet Jhamora is inhabited by two races, the ""barbarian"" Lochni and the highly civilized, four-winged Nohrin, who uneasily share what's left of its space after the Nohrins' original country became uninhabitable some 20 years ago.  A Lochni youth, Delgo (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), unexpectedly meets the Nohrin princess, Kyla (Jennifer Love Hewitt), and is drawn into a plot by her exiled aunt Sedessa (Anne Bancroft) to seize the throne from her father, King Zahn (Louis Gossett, Jr.), and destroy the Lochni once and for all.  To thwart her, Delgo and his friend Filo (Chris Kattan) must free Kyla from her aunt's clutches, expose Sedssa's connection to the king's trusted General Raius (Malcolm McDowell), win over the loyalist Gen. Bogardus (Val Kilmer) to their side, and cope with the hazards endemic to their world, and Delgo must master the mystical training he's been getting ever since his parents were killed in the last Lochni-Nohrin war and he was taken in by Elder Marley (Michael Clarke Duncan).

Created totally by computer, the movie's best part is the sheer strangeness of the world it portrays, a strangeness leavened by the humanoid appearance of the Lochni and the Nohrin and by many of their artifacts (Nohrin architecture has a decidedly Art Nouveau look about it).  The plants and animals are wonderfully imagined and the battle scenes suitably impressive.  Of course it's not quite as convincing as live action might have been, but at least its creators should be given points for doing as well as they did, allowing for the ever-changing capabilities of computer technology, and for sticking to the project for the decade it took them to finish it.",1275004800,9,2222,5.578635014836795

It was almost there, and had some great elements, but had just a few loose nuts and bolts rattling through that kept it from purring along like it ought to have.  One character in particular, Delgo's best friend Filo, really poisoned it for me: his overacting, Jerry Lewis-style antics, and general incompetence really didn't seem to fit the rest of the tale.

3902775,2,B002C2KB12,"Delgo / B002C2KB12

About 20 minutes into ""Delgo"", I felt forced to speak up. ""OK, movie,"" I said, ""I'll make you a deal. You get rid of Jar-Jar Binks, and I'll give you four stars. But if I see one more minute of him, you're getting two.""

The movie, sadly, didn't listen, and here we are.

""Delgo"" is set is a gorgeous fantasy world, more like a dreamy painting than your usual animation fare. The plot is *extremely* derivative (two war-torn races produce two plucky young people of opposite genders, fill in the blanks from there), but the star-crossed lovers destined to unite their peoples is an oldie-but-goodie, so I'm not inclined to complain about that, especially in a movie directed at children. The voice-acting is well-done for the most part, the female character holds her own for the most part (although it's a shame she wasn't allowed to share the movie title with the male character - imagine if Shakespeare's famous play had just been called ""Romeo""), and the plot moves nicely along without many low points.

But admist all this lukewarm praise plops the big, smelly comic relief. For reasons that I cannot begin to fathom, someone thought it would be a good idea to drop a Jar-Jar Binks side-kick into the movie, and then proceed to let him eat up at least 30% of the screentime. He whines, he sniffles, he traipses about in gleeful stupidity - all with a screeching, high-pitched, baby-talk tone that makes me want to claw my ears off my face. Yes, ""Delgo"" is a kids' movie, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shrek/dp/B00009ZYC1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shrek</a>&nbsp;proved that kids' movies (with comic relief, even!) could be fun, even for adults. ""Delgo"", sadly, is not.

It's almost as if they were getting buried on purpose.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but wow, it's like there's PIXAR and DREAMWORKS and that's it.  Well, if you like talking animals and fart jokes then you'll be happy with these two powerhouse studios releasing at least two of these per year, but I myself like animation that pushes the medium in new directions. That's why I recommend you check out Delgo. Delgo is a simple, yet effective all-ages tale set in an alien world of warring tribes.

It seems like with the technology we have that Hollywood would be making the next Star Wars, but there seems to be a vacuum in the Sci-Fi realm.  There are plenty of human-based sci-fi fantasy shows on TV (Battlestar Galactica, StarGate, Doctor Who), but where are all rich, fully realized alien-based fantasy worlds?  Cameron's making Avatar , but in the mean-time you should check out Delgo (and the recently released BATTLE FOR TERRA).  Both are fun, emersive sci-fi/fantasy adventures that explore new strange worlds in detail.

3902795,3,B002C2KB12,"Welcome to the world of Jamorah.

Fathom Studios began development on ""Delgo"" back in 1999 the group created a viral marketing campaign starting in 2001 with teasers with ""From a Studio Nowhere Near Hollywood...From People You've Never Heard of...Comes a Myth for the New Millennium...Delgo"" and from that point, the group launched digital dailies featuring how the film was produced and thus receiving praise by professors from several universities who used the dailies to teach their students for their classes and also was helpful in the company for recruiting talent to become part of the crew.  Talent came from local colleges such as Georgia Tech and Savannah College of Art and Design and other smaller companies to become part of the film.  Even using students from North Atlanta High School as reference points for the animators.

And almost in guerrilla filmmaking fashion, recruitment of the stars who would supply the voice came from artwork kits that came with replica of stones and once the talent agreed to be part of the film, the filmmakers traveled to the actors with recording equipment rather than recording in studios.

But the film suffered setbacks with the deaths of actress Anne Bancroft (""Delgo"" would be her final film) and John Vernon.  Also, Fathom Studios suffered a major setback with the death of  president Kevin Foster and MGM who was originally going to release the film went through corporate restructuring and thus the film was delayed for release.

Now the independent CG animated film that was supposed to come out years earlier was now planned for a theatrical release in December 2008 and was easily buried among the many releases that came out that winter.  Unfortunately, ""Delgo"" which received praise for its online promotion in the early-2000's, came out too late without any marketing support in Dec. 2008 and in the end, had one of the worst openings for a film (the film has grossed nearly $700,000).  Despite what happened in the box office, by no means should people disregard this film as bad.  Because it's not.  If anything, it's a film worth giving a chance.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is presented in widescreen (1.78:1 aspect ratio) format and features English 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround with English, Spanish and French subtitles.

As for the animation, there are scenes that are breathtakingly beautiful but it's important to note that this is an independent film created by a studio in Georgia, this is not a Disney/Pixar or DreamWorks film with a multi-million dollar budget with an award winning crew.

Needless to say, the animation looks good and some may say its comparable to what one would see during a video game cut scene.  But of course, the film will be compared to the bigger budget films and that is where ""Delgo"" is going to receive its criticism.  I read many reviews during the film's release with comments that a film released in 2008, looks as if it's a film created in 2004 or 2005.  Knowing that the film has gone through delays, the CG was constantly upgraded throughout the years during these delays.

Also, for people expecting characters to look as cute as characters we have seen from the big Hollywood animated films, ""Delgo"" goes for a more fantasy look.  Beings from another world that have human characteristics but are not.  Some viewers who are used to a certain animated style may not dig the ""Delgo"" character designs but for me, I looked at the film as trying to do something unique and creating a unique world with its own unique characters, so I was quite supportive of it.

The world that Fantom Studios created was creative, beautiful and for the most part, the crew should be commended for creating such a beautiful world.  Also, interiors for homes and the costumes were quite beautiful to watch.  Characters are displayed with really good facial emotions and for the most part, the film which may not have the luster and vibrancy of the top big budget animated films, still manages to look good with its colorful backgrounds, interiors and overall detail.  But to be fair, on the critical side, for example, during a scene where Delgo and Filo were riding on dinosaur like beasts, we see a variety of rocks.  Where in today's animated films, there are would be plenty of detail on those rocks, the animation for the rocks seen on ""Delgo"" look as if it came from an CG animated film created in the early 2000's.  But again, this is an independent animated film and not a big budget multi-million animated film.  There are wonderful scenes in this film that just look beautiful and enchanting and there are some scenes that revolve around large crowds that look fantastic.

The film does boast plenty of colors and there were times when the digital compression artifacts were noticeable(the battle between Bogardus and Raius).

As for audio, the DVD has a very active 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack.  Good utilization of the front and center channels with clear dialogue but during the action scenes, very good utilization of the surrounds and even LFE through your subwoofer.  For the most part, I was very pleased by the soundtrack.  Sounds for the action sequences, the sounds of the various animals were well done.  Especially the utilization of Geoff Zanelli's music to create the atmosphere of the film.

For the most part, the talents did a fine job with the voice acting and Anne Bancroft did a fantastic job as the voice of Sedessa.  Also, voice talent from Freddie Prinze Jr., Jennifer Love Hewitt and Louis Gosset Jr. were well done.  Although, Chris Kattan's Filo was a bit too Jar Jar Binks for me.

Subtitles are presented in English, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Delgo"" comes with the following special features:

  *
  * Audio Commentary with Directors - Commentary by Mark Adler (writer/director/producer), Jason Maurer (co-director and writer) and Warren Grub (Animation Director and VFX Supervisor).  The men talk about the ideas of the film and certain names used on the film and where it derived from.  Overall, a very in-depth commentary on the creation of the film and for students and future animators, a very good commentary to learn from.
  * Behind-the-Scenes - (3:50) Interviews with the crew of Fantom Studios and the talents from the film.  It was great to see the talents so supportive of this independent animate film.
  * Sounds of Delgo - (5:35) A very good interview with Geoff Zanelli (composer) and Tom Ozanich (Supervising Sound Designer/Re-Recording Mixer) and how they worked together in creating the sounds and music for the film.
  * Meet the Characters - Using your remote, you can view the various characters from the film.
  * See the Creatures - Using your remote, you can view the various creatures from the film.
  * Deleted Scenes - (12:54) 14 deleted scenes from the film.  It would have been wonderful to have optional commentary from the directors of why they chose to omit these scenes from the final cut of the film.
  * Award-winning animated short: Chroma Chameleon - (4:48) After the creation of ""Delgo"", the creators went on to work on an animated short titled ""Chroma Chameleon"".  A fun short with chameleons performing in front of other chameleons in various dances but a character named Hue is unable to change colors like the other chameleons.

I was hoping the ""Delgo Digital Dailies"" would be included on this DVD but hopefully, Twentieth Century Fox considers a Blu-ray release and includes those in the future.  But for now, people can watch the digital dailies here.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I enjoyed ""Delgo"" and what the creators have done in order to create this unique world and its unique characters.

Similar to how I appreciate what Makoto Shinkai did in Japan for showing that quality animation can be done by a person through their home computer (and also with a good eye animation and talent), the same I can feel with what Fantom Studios was able to accomplish with this film and get it out to theaters.  I have to give credit to Fantom Studios for not following the typical trend of other US animation companies and creating their own world and characters.  As with what Jim Henson was able to accomplish in 1983 with ""Dark Crystal"", ""Delgo"" featured a world and its characters which was fresh, unique and I applaud that.

The fact is that the majority of CG animated films are either from the major Hollywood companies or they are direct-to-video, very few independent animated films get into many theaters and the fact that ""Delgo"" did was great.  It was just unfortunate of how many delays this film had to face and the lack money to market the film which made things a bit problematic.

I look at the first film as a more of an introduction to the world of Jhamora and fleshing out the characters or the various tribes within that world.  But there is far more potential of this world and what can be done with it.  I enjoyed the film but its obvious that it may be a bit too serious for children to comprehend and a bit too violent for parents to encourage their children to watch.  It's not the greatest animated film, nor the best looking but I do see the potential in ""Delgo"".

Although the film didn't do well in the box office, I hope that Fantom Studios is able to bounce back and continue the story of ""Delgo"".  I look at this first film as introduction to the characters but a storyline that has a lot of potential.  Square Enix learned through their feature film ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" but managed to bounce back with successfully with direct-to-DVD ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"".  Although, ""Delgo"" is not a popular video game franchise, there is potential with this storyline and I hope in someway this world created by Fantom Studios continues in some format, someway or another.",1249430400,12,9794,4.827834433113377
3902796,5,B002C2KB12,"I went to see the movie Delgo at the Regal Cinema. Before I left I checked my email and right there on the front page of Yahoo there was a news release that Delgo was the biggest flop ever bringing in only $511,920 this past weekend. They didn't even make the top ten. Since I had already made plans with my friend to go I decided to ignore the critic's response to this movie, and I'm very glad I did. I didn't want to take my eyes off of it for a second. The special effects were magnificent. It was a wonderful thrilling movie for a rainy afternoon. It should have done better financially.
I feel like maybe it was because it opened a couple of weeks before Christmas beginning on December 12th, and there were a couple of new Christmas movies playing. And then there were some great children's animated movies playing, ""Madagascar 2"" and ""Bolt"". We had already seen those, and they were good but I can honestly say I enjoyed ""Delgo"" the most. Regretfully the rating I believe is just from bad timing. This movie is rated PG and will be viewed mostly by teens and young adults. It is wonderfully written computer animated movie. The scene is set in a fantasy land and there are a lot of different creatures with different personalities.
It is an action packed science fiction/fantasy story based on a forbidden love between two teens of two different backgrounds and worlds. Delgo (voiced by Freddie Prinz Jr.) was a boy who was adventurous, athletic, and reckless who must face a troubled past of conflicts between the Lockni Village and the Nohrin Army. The Lockni are reptilian looking and the Nohrin look like winged ugly fairies. The girl he falls in love with is Princess Kyla (voiced by Jennifer Love Hewitt) who is spunky, charming, and big hearted but she is from the other side; the Nohrin world.
Kyla's father; King Zahn (voiced by Lou Gosset Jr.); a nice and cautious leader cast out the evil Sedessa (voiced by Anne Bancroft) and cut off her wings fifteen years ago for killing the Queen. Sedessa who is enchanting and power hungry rebuilds her evil reputation. It's up to Delgo and Kyla to stop the war between two civilizations that are divided by fear that is started again by the forgotten enemy.
And would I watch it again? Yes I would and I would buy it on DVD when it becomes available so my grandchildren can watch it. It was great entertainment, and I would recommend everyone to ignore the critics, and decide for your self by going and seeing this very well made adventurous movie.",1248739200,6,2508,4.5631929046563195
3902797,1,B002C2KB12,"I never thought they would have the guts to put this on DVD. The film lasted 6 days in the theater and is the worst grossing film of all time to open on 2000 screens or more. Could be one awesome commentary to hear how it all went so, so wrong. I actually saw the film the day it came out, along with a few hundred others in the world so I feel ""special"" to say that since it will be rare for anyone in history to say they actually saw this weak film opening day.",1248566400,9,463,3.8333333333333335

8362851,4,B002C2KB12,"Kind of the standard two races at war until a third enters the mix type of story.  Not particularly original there.  The animation and music are good.  There isn't a whole lot of development for the characters, but each is memorable in their own way.  It would have been fun if they had done more with the Lokni using the red rocks.  That was fun to watch.",1489536000,,356,4.253731343283582
