8269349,5,B0018C1ZD0,"To classify M as a simple melodrama, or a thriller, or a crime drama would be to underestimate it. Fritz Lang's M is, at parts, tremendously funny. At others, it is immensely disturbing and psychological. But always M holds us in it's grasp; riveting, gripping, and brilliant.

One of the first films about a serial killer, released before that term had even become popular, M didn't just give us one of the most compelling and twisted villains in cinematic history, it makes us identify and perhaps even sympathize with him. The impact of M cannot be understated, as it gave us one of the Golden Age of Hollywood's greatest character actors: Peter Lorre (Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon), popularized police procedurals and serial killers in cinema, and influenced countless other famous filmmakers with it's brilliant expressionist cinematography and visual style.

Though the plot is blindingly simple (A child-hunting serial killer holds Berlin in terror and paranoia. When the police's methods get increasingly desperate and dangerous for underground criminal bosses to sit easy, they send out their own men to apprehend the murderer. Finally, the killer is marked and followed...), M is a complex film that still resonates within our day and age, with it's subtle commentary on our modern society. It's final message (""Someone must watch over the children"") is a little forceful, but Lang get's his message across with haunting effectiveness. I think this is a movie we need more than ever today.

Of course, most praise should go to Peter Lorre, who before his role as baby-faced serial killer Hans Beckert was mainly known as a song-and-dance man. After? He was shot to international fame and became one of Hollywood's most sought after actors. The praise is hugely deserved. Lorre gets under your skin and stays there for a long, long time. As Beckert he is unbelievably creepy - Lorre's mirror scene will send chills up your spine, and the sight of his face illuminated by a flashlight like a deer in the headlights is unsettling on a psychological level. But it is in Lorre's electrifying final scene that he establishes himself as one of cinema's greatest actors. And this is his greatest performance. His final speech is one of the most compelling, disturbing, and gripping scenes I have scene in any cinema. Top marks for the true simmering intensity lying under that mask of pudgy innocence. This is one for the ages.

I want to touch on just one more thing: the stunning visuals. You really shouldn't expect any less from Fritz Lang - this is the megalomaniacal genius that gave us cinema's first sci-fi - Metropolis. But the film is full of arresting imagery of almost startling clarity and beauty. Scenes and shots linger long in the mind after they are seen, and the cinematography (shadows, lights, and darks especially) is the kind that directors dream about in their sleep. But as I said before, this is FRITZ LANG we are talking about!

In conclusion, I can only say: _watch_ M. A classic, but still relevant today, M is a showcase for a peerless and haunting performance from Peter Lorre as one of cinema's most twisted and chilling villains, brilliant visuals, and with a sharp plot, dark humor, satire, and subtle social commentary...this is one of the GREATEST films in foreign cinema.

8269352,5,B0018C1ZD0,"The film opens with a circle of children playing a game that involves a rhyme about a child murderer. This foreshadows the appearance of Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre), a serial killer who preys on children in 1930s Berlin. Initially the audience does not see his face; they merely see his shadow and shots of his body, hearing him whistle ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" (ger. In der Halle des Bergknigs) as he buys a balloon from a blind man and gives it to a little girl named Elsie Beckmann. In the next scene her mother searches frantically as the audience sees the balloon flying up into the telephone lines.

Meanwhile, the police, under Inspector Karl Lohmann, pursue him using such modern police techniques as fingerprinting and handwriting analysis. They also stage raids and round up the usual suspects.

As the police do their work, the criminal underworld of Berlin becomes increasingly concerned about the murder spree. Not only is it bad for business to have the police sniffing around, but it is insulting to be lumped into the same category as a child killer.

Eventually, a race develops between the police and the criminals to catch the killer, who is completely unaware of what is happening. He makes the mistake of whistling again near the same blind balloon salesman. The salesman tells one of the criminals, who tails the killer and, desperate for a way to track him, manages to mark a large letter M onto the killer's coat in chalk.

Now able to track the killer, the criminals pursue him and, after a lengthy search of an office building, finally catch him, bringing him before a kangaroo court. There, Beckert delivers an impassioned monologue, saying that he doesn't want to commit these crimes, and that he should not be punished for being insane. The monologue ends with the line (delivered by Lorre in a near scream) ""Who knows what it's like to be me?""

As the criminals are on the point of killing Beckert, the police arrive, snatching him from their grip.

The final image of the film is that of five judges about to give Beckert his sentence. Before the sentence is announced, the shot cuts to three of the victim's mothers crying, with Elsie's mother delivering the moral of the film: that killing the murderer will do no good, and that parents must watch their children more closely.",1212019200,,2318,4.739454094292804

8269354,5,B0018C1ZD0,"""M"" is one the rare films where viewing it is compulsory. Director Fritz Lang has you in his grip from first frame to last. This is essentially two films. A child murderer is on the loose in Weimar Germany. Panic and paranoia is rampant among the populace. The police are using state-of-the-art(for the time) techniques to track the killer. The underworld is in a lather. Their efforts to nab the killer are not so much altruistic. Rather he's bad for business. The killer's identity is no secret. As the public speculates as to who the murderer could be Lang reveals pudgy, fey Hans Beckert(Peter Lorre). The second half of the film is a treatise on vigilanteism. It is here that Lang demonstrates his belief in civil justice even in the face of the worst atrocity. Beckert, pleaing for his life, manages to rend your heart while admitting to his monstrosity. There are many powerful images on display here none the least the statement that closes the film by the mother of one of Beckert's victims. This film would be a good pairing with another Lang film that concerns itself with mob rule, ""Fury"".",1209859200,5,1101,4.709844559585492
