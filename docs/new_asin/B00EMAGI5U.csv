5927663,5,B00EMAGI5U,Sid the Science Kid are all great educational movies that really do teach your kids educational programing in simple ways.  My daughter always learns so much from these and she's 2!  She sings the songs and learns the lesson they are teaching and will act out what she learns in pretend play.  I love these movies and I think anyone looking for a great way to teach educational concepts to young children in an entertaining way should consider these movies.,1417564800,,457,4.6875

5927667,5,B00EMAGI5U,"This is a really high-quality show that stirs up the imagination.  Sid is an intensely curious preschooler.  He uses questioning skills, surveys, and observation to learn about his environment.  I also love the other characters in the show.  Sid's parents, grandparents, and teacher Susie are active listeners.  The episodes frequently engage Sid's family in his activities.  When Miss Susie addresses her students she calls them ""scientists.""  All of these factors reinforce the idea of positive role models and help children to develop self-esteem.  I received this DVD to review. The opinions shared here are 100% mine.",1386288000,,622,5.40625
5927668,5,B00EMAGI5U,"It is good for the kids teaching them how to take care of pets as well as teaching them responsibility. We currently have a few pets but none the kids can actually help with.

In one of the episodes they teach about allergies, its perfect in our house because the baby actually has a strawberry allergy as well as a dairy allergy!

As always we loved the DVD and I love all the catchy songs Sid always sings! This DVD would make a great Christmas for any small child!!",1385942400,,468,4.247191011235955

8606798,5,B00EMAGI5U,My grandson loves Sid! He's been watching sid on PBS since he was a year old. He's now 19 months and sings along dances and attentively watches the episodes. Sid is a great learning tool for all preschoolers and children.,1526860800,,221,4.55
8606799,5,B00EMAGI5U,"I am a Kindergarten teacher and just recently found out about Sid the Science Kid. Where have I been? The first episode I watched was the whale episode that discusses non standard measurement. Wow...perfect for classroom use! I love how with each episode, it gives the children (and adults) an easy way to experiment that episode's concept. The concepts are explained in detail on an appropriate level. The DVD itself came in great condition. Great series to introduce your child to scientific thinking!!!",1523750400,,505,5.096385542168675
8606800,5,B00EMAGI5U,This is a great show that keeps my boys' attention while teaching fun science concepts.  It teaches kids about the scientific method and encourages them to learn about the world on their own.  These episodes are great and the songs are catchy.,1502841600,,243,4.761904761904762

8606804,5,B00EMAGI5U,Love the graphics and the lessons taught.  Saw this series at a friends house earlier this year with her two year old and we both had a blast watching them.  Jim Henson is always a win in my book.  Especially as it encourages kids to ask questions about the world around them.  I bought a bunch of these for my 2 yr old niece and she's having a blast being introduced to Sid and his crew.  Fun & Educational to boot too!!!,1482278400,,422,4.097560975609756
