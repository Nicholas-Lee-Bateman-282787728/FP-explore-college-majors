McClelland is correct about the title of the movie. It should have remained Angel In Red. Uncaged is not just generic sounding, but plain old stupid!

What I really liked about the movie is the characters. While all of them were flawed they were all believable. The writer of the story portrayed the streets as realistically as possible. The actresses portray prostitutes ralistically. The pimps are not stereotypical, either. All of the characters displayed could exist in any big American city.

But what I really like most was the lack of any police presence in the film. The police are nowhere to be seen and as a result of this the story really takes off; why? Because it is the people who reside on the streets (Pimps & Prostitutes) that deal with the problems surrounding their lives-perhaps in the only way they know how.

Uncaged/Angel In Red is Four Stars (In My Opinion) for the suspense and action as well as the well-written plot. I only wish it would be released on DVD. That is the real problem with the format of DVD. Only 85% of the motion pictures were ever released on DVD, as a result a plethora of small budget and independent films have been left out of the loop of DVD. This is a travesty. When VHS came out, 99% of all motion pictures were formatted for the VCR. This has not been the case with the DVD player.

Leslie Bega really shines in this production. I was rooting for her character throughout the movie and felt for her in her wins and losses. She was kind to her friends, yet ruthless to her enemies, as a poor fellow finds out in the movie.

I highly recomend this movie to anyone that enjoys urban suspense and/or dramas. You won't be dissapointed.

7823072,3,6302232236,"This movie is a virtual scene for scene remake of a 1985 movie called ""Streetwalkin'."" And it has some of the same actors too. I liked this version better and Leslie Bega,who plays Micki, is really hot! However, I am wondering why they changed the name of this movie. It used to be called ""Angel In Red"" and I liked that title better. ""Uncaged"" is too generic and vague.",1035849600,2,370,4.3768115942028984
7823073,5,6302232236,"Heart-raking story of a prostitute working to keep her and her brother off the streets and has all that she's worked for taken away by her lover: a cold, jealous, psychopath who will stop at nothing just to feel she's  staying faithful. Don't be fooled for a second by the video box, this is a  sad, WELL-ACTED tearfest.",953164800,2,320,4.5
