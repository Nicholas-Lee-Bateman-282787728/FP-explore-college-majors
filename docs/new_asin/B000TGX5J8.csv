2901323,5,B000TGX5J8,"This was an incredible show. It was gripping, well written, and perfectly cast. It's right up there at the top of my I-hope-it-gets-released list.",1198972800,11,146,5.125
2901324,5,B000TGX5J8,"This is NOT a standard, boring police procedural like so many of the others on tv these days.  This show was comprised of fully realized, complex characters set in interesting and unique storylines.  That all the L & O and CSI clones continue on while this much better show was not only cancelled, but hasn't even been put on dvd yet is ridiculous.  The only show of similar quality on tv is ""Criminal Minds"" - AND ""The Inside"" WAS STILL BETTER.  All the 5-star reviews are well-deserved.",1196899200,20,488,4.574712643678161
2901325,5,B000TGX5J8,"This TIm Minear-produced series was remarkable.  I have read all the scripts on his website, including unaired episodes.  It must be released on DVD.  Peter Coyote's performance is peerless.  Adam Baldwin is perfect as always. Newcomer (at the time) Rachel Nichols is a revelation as the child kidnap victim, Becky, turned FBI profiler, Rebecca.  Truly good stuff!!!!!",1195776000,3,368,5.385964912280702
2901326,5,B000TGX5J8,"This was a very well written series that deserved another season.  Alas, that was not the case.  I have been eagerly awaiting the release of the series DVD, but once again it looks like I will be disappointed.  Considering some of the awful shows still on TV, it seems wrong not to release one great one on DVD!",1190160000,13,311,4.327586206896552
2901327,5,B000TGX5J8,"You probably think you've seen this before: damaged FBI agent and her team hunt for serial killers. At least that's what I thought before I watched this. But somehow they've managed to make this a fresh and interesting new show. The writing is excellent,even funny at times,and the cast does a great job. I mean, who knew Rachel Nichols could act? She is SO much better here than she was on ALIAS. And Adam Baldwin is one of my favourite actors. The central character, played by the aforementioned Rachel Nichols, is truly a tortured and damaged person, still struggling with the aftereffects of what happened to her when she was a little girl. This gives her a unique insight into their cases, and is often the key to solving them. But it makes you wonder how long it will be until she cracks under the pressure. All in all, a great show that was cancelled too soon. Hopefully the DVD will be out soon!",1184889600,3,903,4.512195121951219
8209455,5,B000TGX5J8,"This series was one of the first ""summer series"" televised. As such, most people were not used to tuning in for new shows during the ""fun in the sun"" months. This lead to the show's early cancellation. I for one would love to see this series on Amazon instant video! It would be a great addition!

Fans of Adam Baldwin in his serious roles will enjoy this series.",1450483200,,363,4.338235294117647
8209456,5,B000TGX5J8,You can get this at ioffer.com. They have the complete series there for nineteen dollars and it even has unaired episodes.,1396396800,2,122,4.857142857142857
8209457,5,B000TGX5J8,"Years later, I'm still waiting for the DVD release of ""The Inside."" So many years have gone by since this excellent 2005 show was canceled after only seven episodes, leaving six of the 13 filmed episodes unaired. Unique, well written episodes and gripping, thoroughly enjoyable characters; outstanding acting and perfectly-cast actors rounded out this remarkable series starring the incredible Peter Coyote. The terrific supporting cast included Rachel Nichols, Adam Baldwin, Jay Harrington, Katie Finneran and Nelsan Ellis who provided the perfect team to Peter Coyote's role as their gruff FBI boss in a Los Angeles-based FBI Violent Crimes Unit (VCU) who solved some fascinatingly dark crimes. ""The Inside"" still remains one of my all time favorite TV shows. My questions: why hasn't ""The Inside"" been released on DVD? What does it take to get a TV show to DVD? I wish I knew the answers to those questions. And so, I keep waiting.",1356480000,2,934,5.111111111111111
8209458,5,B000TGX5J8,"This procedural only got one season, but that one season deserves a DVD release!

Don't be fooled-- while the cases themselves are interesting enough, it's the characters that really bring this to life.  If you focus on the team and their sometimes subtle interactions, the show is just so very clever and really quite brilliant in many ways.  Rachel Nichols does a brilliant job at playing Rebecca Locke, the emotionally damaged new FBI agent, and Peter Coyote gives his best performance as the shady boss of the team, Virgil Webster.  With Adam Baldwin, Katie Finneran, Neslan Ellis, and Jay Harringon rounding out the rest of the cast, things get even better.

Give his creepy, awesome, intricate show a chance!

Poor Tim Minear-- brilliant ideas, lots of cancelled shows to show for it.

Please put this on DVD!  The show deserves it!",1322092800,7,838,4.8936170212765955
8209459,5,B000TGX5J8,"I have been trying to get this series for years. I wrote to Fox years ago; I signed petitions requesting the production of DVDs; I've seen nothing until this page just now. This was an awesome series, each week better than the last---if that's possible (it was!). I heard that it was available in England for purchase (never found it) and that it was shown in its entirety (the whole 13 episodes instead of the 5 we managed to see on US television) in Canada.
Come on, folks. What does it take????? Everyone I know who watched this loved it. Heard Sci-Fi channel wanted, but couldn't afford, to acquire the series.
If it costs $1 per DVD to produce, it's ridiculous it hasn't been out before now. In view of all the trash that is on television, DVD, or VHS---this makes no sense.
Ok, I'm BEGGING NOW----please get this on DVD ASAP. I will buy at least 3 complete sets for self and friends.",1309392000,5,889,4.426829268292683
8209460,5,B000TGX5J8,"This show was so ahead of its time.  It was one of the first (if not THE first) intelligently warped pyscho-crime shows.  Very dark and haunting with three dimensional characters and smart dialog.  I can't image where this FBI team would have gone if they had had 3-4 seasons to develop.  Truly a shame that it got cancelled.  Please, at least, give us all recorded shows on DVD.

Maybe if the producers had sprung for a snappy theme song from The Who....",1300406400,2,455,4.487804878048781
8209461,5,B000TGX5J8,"I love Criminal Minds, but this show was so much better. Fox never gave this show a chance, killing it in favor of SYTYCD. When you watch the episodes you will see quite a few plot lines that will later show up in other tv shows. (The episode pre-filer might remind you of a certain very popular tv character)",1288137600,,309,4.254237288135593
8209462,5,B000TGX5J8,"With all the crap on T.V. today, I am still astounded this show didn't make it. It was intelligent, gripping and the cast was spot on.  All I can say is BOOOOOOOO....We want the DVD's!!!!",1274745600,2,187,4.3428571428571425
8209463,5,B000TGX5J8,"This was a great show.  I was thoroughly disappointed when this show was cancelled.  Within 5 minutes of previewing the pilot, I knew that this show was going to be different from all the other forensic/cop shows that are out there.  This is a truely mind-blowing series that was regretably short-lived.  I am hoping that they will release this series on DVD since other shows like The Simple Life and The Hills are on DVD, and they aren't even remotely close to being as good as this show was......I am hoping that when they do release this on DVD, the same thing will happen like it did with Family Guy; enough people will buy it that they will realize that they have made a mistake in cancelling this series and will re-release it and make new shows. Here's to keeping my fingers crossed...",1219881600,7,793,4.524475524475524
8209464,5,B000TGX5J8,"A great Tim Minear production. Wonderfalls was released and was cancelled early, why not The Inside? It would be great it they included the original pilot as well. The original approach of the series was more like 21 Jump Street. Fox dumped a lot of money in to this production, it needs to see the light of day.",1214265600,5,312,4.396551724137931
