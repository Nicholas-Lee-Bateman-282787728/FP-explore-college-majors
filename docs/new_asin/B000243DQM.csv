2060702,2,B000243DQM,"This is an excellent mini-series that I enjoyed watching on TV when it was first shown in the late 1970s. I hadn't seen it since and was therefore willing to take a chance on buying the only DVD version available. I don't normally buy a DVD unless the reviewers say the picture quality is good.  But there was only 1 Amazon review which did not note picture quality and no reviews on the Web, but I took a chance anyway. Big mistake. The picture is awful, looks like it was dubbed off a video tape or TV broadcast. The focus in every scene is soft and the colors are washed out. I like to leave a negative review in cases like this to spare anyone else the grief of spending their money on junk like this.",1184976000,8,705,4.1838235294117645
2060703,5,B000243DQM,"Release of this mini-series Film on DVD in the US is LONG OVERDUE!

As a fan of bio-pics, and historical accounts of recent history, especially WWII, I have to say that this is one of the best ever produced.  It is a unique view of the events surrounding one of America's most famous and popular (although, in my opinion, also one of the most over-rated) generals, Dwight D. Eisenhower.

This unique view is from the perspective of IKE's English female driver, personal secretary, confidant and love-interest, Kay Summersby.  Much is taken from the book that she wrote.  I read her book shortly after seeing this mini-series when it originally aired.  And the account given here is consistent with her account.  Some historians have since argued that Kay overstated her role.  However, I found her story, as I read it those years ago, to be believable, and not out-of-step with biographies of IKE I have read since then.  Furthermore, Kay did not state that they had this passionate love affair, but rather emphasized the intimate feelings that she and IKE had developed for each other, not unusual for two people caught in such events and working so closely together.  I recall that Kay also emphasized that, although she was ""in love"" with IKE, and she believed that he had strong feelings for her, he had never voiced those feelings even when they were alone together.

I find this Film very compelling.  I have seen it several times (from my laserdisc copy) since the original airing.  I must say each repeat viewing is as good as or even better than the one before.  It is one of the best non-fictional accounts of that era - along with Eleanor & Franklin (recently released on DVD), Tora Tora Tora,  and Midway (if you fast forward through the fictional story-halting father/son relationship scenes).

Robert Duvall's performance is outstanding.  There are moments - particularly the scene of him with the airborne troops as they prepared for their pre-D-Day launch - when it is as if the pictures I have seen taken from the actual event have come to life.  Lee Remick gives a touching, heart-felt and convincing portrayal of Kay Summersby.  I have never seen any interviews of Kay (if they even exist), but Remick seems to fit the physical type, based on the photos I have seen.  And her portrayal seems to be consistent with what I read in her book.  The supporting cast is excellent.

(A bit off topic, but I had mentioned above that I believe IKE to be over-rated as a general.  If you are interested in the strategic and tactical facts surrounding D-Day, read the account written by Stephen E. Ambrose, ""D Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II.""  It is excellent.  I liked it because it allowed me to sift through some of the scenes in one of my all-time-favorite WWII movies, ""The Longest Day"", to determine how much was fiction and how much was factual or at least fact-based.  I found the film (""The Longest Day) to be surprisingly consistent with fact.  And although Ambrose's book does not necessarily draw this direct conclusion, I can't help but find ultimate responsibility for much that went wrong with D-Day - the preventable casualties and ineffective use of tanks and off-shore bombardment during the actual landing, etc. - with IKE, and in particular his decision to place the American invasion under the command of Bradley (another extremely over-rated general, IMO),  rather than the far more experienced and capable Patton.)

Also, a quick note that this film does not detail ""the life of Dwight D. Eisenhower"" as the summary states.  Rather it begins with the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and ends with the end of hostilities in Europe.  If you are looking for a bio-pic of the ""life of Dwight D. Eisenhower"", including events leading up to WWII (including his role in WWI serving with General MacArthur) and events subsequent to WWII (including his role in Europe during the Truman Administration and his role as President of the United States), this is not it.  It simply does not cover those events at all.  I am not aware of any bio-pic that does.  The best I am aware of is the American Experience biography of Eisenhower, which I strongly recommend.

EPILOG:  Something very telling of the character and personality of Dwight D. Eisenhower that still stands out for me to this day from Kay Summersby's book, (which would have been a nice touch to somehow have put in the film), was something she wrote about the dog she had given to IKE as a birthday present.  As revealed in the film, IKE had named the dog Telek; after his England HQ (Telegraph Cottage) and Kay (Tele-K).  When he left, he left the dog with Kay - presumably he did not want, or could not deal with, such a reminder of her when he went back to his life with Mamie.  Years after he had left, and I believe was already President, Telek died.  Kay wrote to IKE to let him know.  I don't know if the letter ever survived - or if it was destroyed by IKE or possibly intercepted by one of this staff.  Either way, Kay wrote in her book that IKE never replied.",1177027200,12,5069,4.6749435665914225

2060705,5,B000243DQM,"I think Robert Duvall is excellent and the guy who played Churchill was great too. I think they spent a little too much time on the affair though. I love Darren McGavin in other roles, but he can't pull off Patton. Of course anyone will come off looking bad as Patton after George C Scott's great performance.

Still though, probably the best Ike movie out there. Definitely better than the Tom Sellak (sp?) one.",1408665600,,412,4.5675675675675675

2060707,4,B000243DQM,"I last saw this mini-series when it came out in 1978 and loved it.  It covers Ike's war record and is pretty close to the history of the man during WWII.  Robert Duvall gives a terrific performance as Ike.  The mini-series really doesn't get into whether he had an affair with Kay Summersby, played well by Lee Remick.  I was very happy to finally track this mini-series down through amazon.com and am more than satisfied with the movie and the amount I payed for shipping and the amount of time it took to get to me.",1404864000,2,517,4.354166666666667

Then, the words and pictures did not exactly coordinate.  It was somewhat annoying to me, but my husband was so delighted that it had much better audio then his old one that he didn't seem to mind.  I wish there was a way to correct the problem, but since he is the one that watches the movie, I guess I won't spend too much time worrying about it.",1398902400,2,503,4.2631578947368425

2060712,5,B000243DQM,"If you are looking to acquire this title, you probably already know that it is an excellent docudrama with outstanding performances by Robert Duvall and Lee Remick, justifying the 5-star rating. Consequently, this review will concentrate on the technical quality of the Loving The Classics (LTC) release, which was what I received after ordering this item. Since Amazon's product description does not specify a studio (or company issuing the DVD), who knows what the source of the product you'll get will be.

To begin with, despite Amazon's product info and the ""manufacturer's"" claim on the packaging (see ""Customer Image"" above),  the actual running time is closer to 267 minutes, which would be about right for a program originally shown in three, 2-hour time slots. The product comes on three discs each one apparently containing a complete program as originally broadcast; each including the same opening teaser and closing credits.

Although I would not say that this DVD release was digitally enhanced as the resolution leaves something to be desired when compared to the higher definition of most studio released DVDs, the quality of the transfer is generally good. Given that these are DVD-R discs (although I'm not too sure whether the discs themselves are of archival quality), it is not obvious if they were reproduced from a VHS source. For the most part, the color saturation, although perhaps a little ""faded"" in some scenes (which would be consistent with mastering from film that probably was at least thirty years old when the DVD would have been mastered), does not vary within scenes and I noticed few, if any, distracting artifacts. The one exception is in what looks like color footage of actual combat which would have been over thirty years old at the time that the mini-series was produced and consequently would have color alterations due to age even in the original.

For fans of this title, I would recommend this product but caution against paying too much for it as it is currently available directly from the ""manufacturer's"" website for under $20 including shipping.

Also, there are a few reviews of a DVD release of this title (which may or may not be the LTC one) under the listing for the VHS version that the reader may find helpful.",1396742400,3,2271,4.96578947368421

8021634,5,B000243DQM,"I was disappointed to find that this DVD is no longer available after searching for many years for a copy of the made for TV movie. For those interested in a (very) little of the movie making background, I was an extra during the filming while in the USAF stationed at RAF Mildenhal from 76-78. Pinewood studios asked our base commander if he would allow US service people to volunteer (and get paid a small daily salary) to act as marching troops. 100's of us would be needed to march around the airplanes on the tarmac to show troops getting ready for deployment for the D-Day invasion. We were all given WW2 era helmets and jackets and fake M1 rifles, and told to wear our standard issue fatigues and boots underneath. We marched around basically in a loop around the 5 or 6 DC-3 aircraft that I heard they had to fly all the way from South America. They painted them to appear as they would have for the era. During one of our breaks, me and my buddy snuck inside one of them and looked around. We actually sat in the cockpit for a while watching our other buddies march around in circles. I still remember the smell inside the airplane which was the same smell all airplanes used to have back in those days.

Once we got out of the plane and joined the others, the marching around in circles while in formation got very old very quickly.  So me and my buddy decided on the second day, we would slip away again. This time we somehow managed to sneak behind the ropes to where the real actors were being handed out small roles for a scene where Robert Duvall would ask questions to a few of the enlisted troops acting as they were waiting to board the plane for the big mission. I recall that all of the real actors were Brits who had to change their accents to match the small roles they were given. Me and my buddy spent the entire afternoon hanging around these real actors rehearsing the scene which involved Robert Duvall asking questions such as where they were from to a few of the 'soldiers'. It was interesting to hear how the Brits would suddenly start speaking like they were from Brooklyn or Tulsa or wherever they were supposed to hail from.  I never had the chance to see the mini-series because it aired on TV while I was overseas, so I don't remember exactly what was asked and what was said or whether the scene was even used in the movie. But I was stoked to have been given a tiny speaking part. (Something like ""Yeah, me too!)Sadly, that was only during rehearsal.

I can't recall how, but my buddy somehow met Lee Remick and she gave him an autographed photo made out to him. When my buddy and I got back to the chow hall after work that second day, we were bragging up our big break into Hollywood. We had proof of our great fortune with the signed photo of Ms. Remick. I went to bed that night with visions of my big break dancing in my head.

Sadly, as fate would have it, the next morning when we tried to go back to set where the ""real"" actors were, we could not get past the security ropes. We did not have the proper pass and would not be allowed past the ropes despite our pleas that we had ""talking roles"" and Mr. Duvall would be expecting us there for the shoot today. The SP's told us to get back with the rest of the grunts humping the flight-line, and in so ending my short-lived acting career. At least I still have my faded copy of my Pinewood studios ""Artist's Salary Voucher""  although it now looks blank since it was a carbon copy.

I will always remember how great Robert Duvall was to everyone and I've followed his long and extremely accomplished film career ever since. One of the best actors of all time in my opinion.

PS- in one last desperate attempt to somehow stand out from the masses of marching green uniforms, I found a yellow wildflower growing out of a crack on the tarmac and stuck it in a buttonhole om my jacket. I was hoping to find the DVD so I could look for it in slow motion. If anyone manages to spot me in the crowd of soldiers marching down the flight-line, my mission was successful.",1419292800,,4053,4.309711286089239
