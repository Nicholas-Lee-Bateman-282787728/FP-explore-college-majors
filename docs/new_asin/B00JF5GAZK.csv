8650452,5,B00JF5GAZK,I had this movie on Video Cassette now that the Video cassette have become obsolete. I have started replacing a lot of my Videocassette movies. In 1968 I was a freshman in High School when I saw this movie. I really like this movie a lot and love the DVD as well. The picture looks really sharp and the characters are still just as fresh as the original movie. I would recommend this movie and the seller to other customers.,1496793600,,424,4.3125
