8433047,2,B004KKYA9S,"Sorry, but the makers managed to turn a heroic and exciting event into a very boring DVD. The story was more about the literary travels of the original poem than the events that inspired it.",1493942400,,190,4.457142857142857

8433052,3,B004KKYA9S,It moves pretty fast.  Great for adults or high school students.  Moves just a touch too quickly for middle school.,1412467200,2,115,4.7
8433053,4,B004KKYA9S,"Terrific brief history of the battle, the origin of the flag that flew over Ft McHenry, and how and why Francis Scott Key was in the harbor during the battle and through until the morning and saw the American flag ""was still there"". Great for students who need to learn more about our nation's history to appreciate it and as citizens of our country.",1355616000,2,350,4.484375
8433054,5,B004KKYA9S,"Very good documentary.  It is short, perfect for teachers. If people knew the story behind our National Anthem, the maybe they would take a little more pride, and have a little more respect when it is played.",1330128000,2,208,4.621621621621622
