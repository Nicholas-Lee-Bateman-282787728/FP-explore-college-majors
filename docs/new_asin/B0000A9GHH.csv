1903968,1,B0000A9GHH,"I cannot believe the black actor in this film is so sterotypical of the ghetto or uneducated image we've seen in films like ""baby boy"". Almost every line he had included a cuss word or n word. He didn't add a thing to the film except to be an annoyance. I don't know what this film was about. There are parts where there is a long silence with no talking. The whole movie was shot in the house with the exception of the maid when she finally leaves the house.
There are a few scenes where the characters are running around  without any obvious aim. The film attempts to make the audience interested only to leave us saying, ""what was all that excitement about?""",1100649600,,661,4.330645161290323
1903969,4,B0000A9GHH,"I'd been told this was a ""small"" movie, and wasn't expecting a great deal, but was thoroughly entertained.  The plot develops in surprising ways; and the characters seem appropriately off-balance throughout.  I understand portions of the movie were improvised, which may account for this.  If so, it's a thoroughly appropriate tactic.  The only word of warning is that you may need some French to understand the entertaining way it's fractured in this movie, and the iron control the French characters must be exercising to control their faces in response.  Rule of thumb: if you don't know what a bijou is, you might not get it.
A fascinating exercise is to compare this movie with I Capture the Castle (2003), which develops the identical premise in a completely different way.",1082678400,3,779,5.007751937984496
1903970,1,B0000A9GHH,"How anyone could rate this movie 4-5 stars is beyond belief. This was such a contrived movie that had a simple plot that went nowhere. As I watched this movie I could not figure out if it was meant to be a comedy or a drama. It was never very funny and both lead actors, playing one white and one adopted black brother, had scenes in the movie that were terrible. Romany Malco has a scene where he is running around in his underwear for no apparent reason accept to show off his body. He jumps out of bed when his cell phone rings, runs down the stairs and then outside and back in just to gather everyone in the house and scold them, in his drawers? He is talentless and idiotic as a ""brother"" in France that no one can relate to. Paul Rudd is likable but his shining scene is when he comes back to the chateau drunk and ""grossly"" tells off everyone - people he has known for less than a week! The servants are the best actors in the movie and play their parts well...but can't make up for the dismal rest. Ludicrous - a bad movie that probably could have been funny if they had went for laughs instead of drama. This is another example of a rental that you think is going to be good but then disappoints!",1078358400,,1206,4.1581196581196584
1903971,5,B0000A9GHH,i found this movie through my local library. i have to say it's a fun gem.,1076716800,4,74,3.6875
7996231,1,B0000A9GHH,I love paul rudd but this movie is stupid.,1431043200,,42,3.7777777777777777
7996232,4,B0000A9GHH,Low budget action....fairly charming.....a few solids laughs...plenty of flaws but you become so engulfed by slyvie testud's performance that you can give two s***s about the flaws...she is captivating,1425340800,,201,5.9655172413793105

7996234,1,B0000A9GHH,"One of the worst ""Ugly Americans Overseas"" type films I've seen.  I typically like these guys, but the acting is pretty dreadful in this film.  The plot is thin, and the writing is terrible.  I echo the sentiment that this looks like a poorly done Film Studies project. I'm just grateful I didn't pay anything to watch this.",1420416000,,324,4.551724137931035
7996235,2,B0000A9GHH,"The stereotypical goofy white guy and his angry black ""adopted brother"" go to France after receiving a letter that their great uncle has died and left them a sort of bed and breakfast.  Of course it immediately turns out to be a dump and the oddball staff expect job security for life.  Without giving away the plot ""twists"" both sides are looking for easy money.  Most of the gags involve hidden agendas and misunderstandings.  Only one Paul Rudd speech near the end made me laugh out loud.  It's too bad the rest of the script had him stuck in a quick sand of cliches.",1388361600,,570,4.4423076923076925
7996236,5,B0000A9GHH,"Too bad there's not a better pressing of this disc. Every copy I've seen looks like a bootleg. It would be worth it for the producers/distributors, whoever, to make a decent copy. This is Paul Rudd's best work! The entire cast is superb. Brilliant premise. Great clashing of cultures. I laughed throughout!",1384300800,,306,4.903846153846154
7996237,5,B0000A9GHH,Glad to add this flick to my collection. Very happy how quickly it arrived. The experience was almost as satisfying as brick and mortar.,1360540800,,136,4.708333333333333
7996238,2,B0000A9GHH,"Why on earth a very talented actor like Paul Rudd would appear in an improvised college student style ""B"" Movie is beyond me ! It could have been tolerable if it hadn't been for the appalling quality of the picture quality - it was like watching a damaged VHS tape / not what you expect in 2007 on DVD - not a funny film either with the black brother in the movie using an obsenity every 2 nd word / i would love to know what sort of brothers they were ?? Not recommended unless you like to watch  a students film project !!",1197763200,,524,4.038461538461538
7996239,1,B0000A9GHH,"I saw the directors of this ""film"" on Charlie Rose, of all places.  All they talked about was how easy it was to make their film with digital video cameras.  I'm glad it was easy to make their film, because it certainly wasn't easy to watch it.  This film is slight, stupid, boring, and terrible, from both a technical standpoint and an aesthetic one.  It seems the filmmakers said ""let's go to a chateau with some actors and real cheap DV cameras"" and make a movie.  Well, that's exactly what they did.  When people proclaim DV the future, junk like this gets made, distributed, and even put on DVD.  I have seen good, even great films, shot on DV, but this isn't even close.  Technology ultimately doesn't matter if your films sucks, and this film sucks.",1165104000,,756,4.507352941176471
7996240,1,B0000A9GHH,"After having seen this movie, I understand why Europeans, Arabs and everybody else hates Americans... There are scenes where we hoped the servants would either poison the two annoying guys from Kansas or just flat out shoot them in a hunting accident and make them disappear.

The story idea is great, but the acting and script is so poor and unworthy of being described in a review.

Jesse must either have personal ties to the building where he filmed-or really fallen in love with the building. Everytime the story could have taken off we get a stop with yet another look at the building itself.

It's a miracle to us, how anybody on here could call this movie funny or entertaining - the movie is bad, pretending it to be a satyre doesn't make it any better.",1123372800,,762,4.547445255474453
