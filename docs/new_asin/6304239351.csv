818685,4,6304239351,"A quite intense low-budget noir ""docudrama"", distinguished by Basehart's surprisingly perverse, desperate performance. And one great shock: a fugitive-in-the-sewers sequence that Carol Reed seems to have  lifted totally the next year for ""The Third Man"". Shame on him!",964051200,5,268,6.052631578947368
818686,4,6304239351,"""He Walked By Night"" is a fine noir that deserves more attention. There is no femme fatale and the the procedural scenes with the cops bog it down a bit, but, the tragic relationship between sociopath Roy  and put-upon pantywaist Reeves is facinating. Oh, yes...the film is lit (or  rather, un-lit) by a fellow named John Alton who just happens to be the  Babe Ruth of noir cinamatographers. There are certain images and angles in  this film that will stay with you a long, long time. Also affecting is the  rapport Roy has with his little doggie. It is only at these moments that we  see that there is human under the killer's visage and it is an touching  thing to witness, making it that much more sad when...oops. See the movie.",963360000,6,732,4.5

818824,4,6304239351,"Watched for free through YouTube, uploaded by Timeless Classic Movies. Both sound and picture quality was excellent and the movie played well over a very fast WIFI connection in my apartment on my Lenovo ThinkPad.

The movie is in excellent black and white and is told in a documentary style -- an excellent police procedural which appealed to Jack Webb. Webb acted in the movie and struck up a friendship with the police technical advisor, Detective Sergeant Marty Wynn. That conversation led Webb to create the radio and television series ""Dragnet"" that I loved so much as a youngster.

[In high school, my best friend and I created a radio clip played to our high school during a talent show -- ""Just the facts, ma'am"" was the punch line that got the most laughs -- several times. We both knew, however, that Webb said something similar -- ""All we want are the facts, ma'am"" or sometimes ""All we know are the facts ma'am."" Our audience loved the Stan Freberg spoofs about the Dragonet and Little Red Riding Hood, and it was Freberg's version we played against.]

""He Walked by Night"" paid great attention to a detailed and realistic portrayal of the nuts and bolts of police work. The film was loosely based on newspaper accounts of the real-life actions of Erwin ""Machine-Gun"" Walker, a former Glendale California police department employee and World War II veteran who unleashed a crime spree of burglaries, robberies, and shootouts in the Los Angeles area during 1945 and 1946.

Here, there is great dramatic tension between the cleverness of Basehart in eluding capture and the methodical approach of the police in finally running him down. The final sequences in the water tunnels of Los Angeles are thrilling, and Basehart, although clearly the star of the movie, has great support from the other cast members, a solid sound track, and excellent direction by Werker.

Very satisfying film-noir.

When a movie start off with a ""true story paragraph"" and a serious sounding narrator I usually roll my eyes and get ready for a sub par movie.

819232,4,6304239351,"Watch this movie for its mesmerising cinematography alone.
The compositions and angles are truly creative, ...one stairwell scene rivalling Escher in its mind-bending perspective.
Perfect black-&-white balance with very reduced middle tones. Horizontal and vertical lines bisect the screen in perfect arrangement.
Shadows of fans, venetian blinds etc. cast over the action, and smoke or fog to add to the wonderful genre that is known as ""film noir"".
The sewers of Los Angeles are used as locations to great effect too.

The story?
Well it's very basic really, and involves nothing more than the police hunt for a criminal cop-killer.
His previous crimes are not really well defined,( other than shooting the cop). He appears to be stealing electrical equipment and hiring it out through some agency? Seems a bit small-time really, but after he plugs a nice family-man cop who later dies,(complete with grieving young widow), and later wounds another, the hunt is on as they say.

There are some VERY ""creative"" (and quite unbelievable) methods of investigation, with eye-witnesses each coming up with separate visual clues on cue to make up an ""Identikit"" picture, and some early punch-card computerisation sorting of known suspects shown. Primitive and probably laughable now, but of course it would have been seen as incredibly ""modern"" investigation at the time of this film's release in 1948.

The oh-so-serious voice-over is often quite unintentionally funny now. You do expect that familiar ""Dragnet"" theme to go DAH-de-duh-DUH DAHHH! any second!

The ending is its greatest flaw.
It just....ends.
There's no resolution or denouement here at all, ...just a hail of gunfire and that's it. Investigation over.
No interrogation, no motives for the shooting, no court drama, no sentencing, ...nothing. Just ""THE END""!

I must admit to feeling just a little cheated by the failure of the narrative to provide any sort of reward for the viewer, but of course the aforementioned cinematography more than makes up for this perceived weakness.

My copy was excellent!
Sharp, clear and with great sound too.

819324,3,6304239351,"The opening of this movie indicates that it was released in 1948.  We also find out where the young Jack Webb got the phrase, ""The names were changed to protect the innocent"" for the later Dragnet series.  In this one Webb got about sixth billing, while Richard Basehart, in probably his first film, got the star billing as the criminal who ""walked by night""--a really bad movie name.  Basehart was good, and Webb was surprisingly loose, but the best one was the unnamed actress who appeared in a cameo role as the woman who thought her neighbor was a ""witch.""  The other actors were fairly competent, and most of them later played supporting roles in various TV shows of the '50s and 60s.
For awhile after the opening the movie itself looks only slightly better than a police training film of the time, but quality improves as the story develops, until at the end it was probably as good as it could be, given the script.  But there are no big stars here, and for good reason: this is a low-budget movie.  It was probably shown at the theaters during the lulls between blockbusters.  Gable, Bogie, Grant, and Cooper wouldn't be caught dead in this film.  I would give it 2 1/2 stars, but since that's not available I'll crank it up to three just for the ending, which was well handled and fairly well acted.  I don't recommend this movie unless you're really, really--and I mean really--an old-movie-type film buff.  Frankly, if I'm watching a movie in that era, it'll be something like ""Shane"" or ""High Noon,"" or whatever Bogie was starring in at the time.

I remember Richard Basehart from the 60's TV show, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Not as a young sociopath armed robber he played in this film. It was also interesting to see a very young Jack Web who later stared Dragnet. This film was shot before the Miranda v. Arizona ruling in 1966 which now protects all Americans.  Back then the police could do pretty much anything to anyone and justify it as crime fighting.
What can you learn from this movie? To start call a lawyer if the police keep you for questioning in a crime. In the 1940's the police could round up all the men in area, innocent or not in a ""dragnet"" when a serious crime occurred. Then finger print them all depriving them of their civil rights in a crime fishing expedition. Another police procedure of the day was demonstrated in this film as the police use a witness with little regards for his safety to achieve their objective to catch a killer. Their rational being the end justifies the means. It was a very good period piece with the old cars, fedora hats and police procedures. Ahhh, the good old days.",1394496000,,1234,4.412280701754386

819412,4,6304239351,"This 1948 film, ""He Walked by Night"" combines the genres of police procedural and film noir. The ostensible focus of the film is the Los Angeles Police Department and its patience and persistence in tracking down a notorious killer and robber. But the noir-character criminal is himself the center of attention.

Set in the mid-1940's, ""He Walked by Night"" begins with a voice-over celebrating Los Angeles and its famed police force. The voice-over appears repeatedly in the film to editorialize on the virtues of the police. The story itself begins with the late night murder of a police officer by a lone individual when the officer foils a break-in attempt on a deserted street. The police later link the murder to a series of robberies of sophisticated electronics equipment and a subsequent series of burglaries of liquor stores and other establishments. Work by a forensic technician, Lee, (Jack Webb) provides a few clues but the police appear stymied. Hard, slow patient investigation and following-up leads ultimately save the day.

The quarry the police seek is a man in his mid-20s, Roy Morgan, played to the hilt by Richard Basehart. Morgan is a troubled, psychotic, but highly gifted loner who walks the streets at night to rob electronics stores. He sells stolen electronics goods to a milquetoastish electronics dealer, Paul Reeves, acted in character by Whit Bissell. Morgan lives alone in a squalid bungalow with a dog his only companion. He says little in the film beyond the words necessary for his criminal activities and his background is deliberately kept obscure. He is resourceful and ruthless and generally stays a step in front of his police pursuers until their diligent plodding catches up.  There are resemblances in the plot to the story of the hare and the tortoise.

The police procedural aspects of the story became the basis for subsequent films in the genre and for the ""Dragnet"" TV show. The police are indeed slow, methodical, and dedicated to catching the criminal. This portion of the film is good but somewhat routine. The acting is adequate and the intervening voice-overs are excessive.

The movie comes to life in the portrayal of the psychotically gifted Morgan as he walks the streets, eludes the police, snarls and pouts, and plays with his dog. Morgan is a rough character as, at the cost of great pain, he extracts a bullet from his arm and faces down a large group of pursuing police officers in the final climactic shoot-out in a Los Angeles storm drainage tunnel system. An anti-hero, Morgan captures the heart of the viewers that the film on the surface wants to give to the police.

The setting of the film, in deserted city streets at night, in cheap lodgings, and in the tunnels also is distinctively noir. The shadows, angles, and night scenes emphasize noir over the investigative scenes at the police headquarters.

I had the opportunity to see this film on screen as part of an annual noir film festival held at the American Film Institute near Washington D.C. The film is otherwise readily accessible.  I was more interested in the noir aspects than in the detective aspects of the movie, but those interested in either genre will enjoy this historic film.

819413,3,6304239351,"This film tracks the peregrinations of a psychopath - and, as such, it provides a fascinating window which exposes the methods and activities of a heinous criminal. This criminal warrants our attention, as his brilliance in pursuing electrical engineering and in evading the police are impressive. We observe him murdering a policeman, paralysing another, and robbing small business people, among other peccant behaviors - all the while continuing his inventive exploits. And yet, he earns our sympathy as an amoral protagonist: he is a quintessential film noir hero, a man of questionable character who represents the ""dark"" side of our own inner selves.

The scenes devoted to our criminal are heightened by typical film noir traits: severe chiaroscuro and dramatic camera angles. Furthermore, another important film noir element is our criminal's enigmatic motivations. He is presented without a history or background, thus, we do not know why he behaves so egregiously - he simply exists as a pariah of conventional society. These scenes are very compelling, exciting, and suspenseful.

But the aforementioned only provides one-half of this movie. This second half with scenes interpersed throughout consists of a very standard police procedural. These scenes comprise another type of film noir: the semi-documentary portraying the procedurals of the FBI, the municipal police, the detective, and other authoritative figures. Many semi-documentary films noirs have been acclaimed, e.g., ""The House on 92nd Street"" and ""The Street with No Name."" But, unfortunately, that acclaim cannot be applied here. These procedural scenes are notable in contrast to those depicting the criminal - they are flatly lighted, poorly paced, and dismally acted. It may have been the director's and writers' intent to portray morality and convention as mundane and to portray criminality as expressionistic and truly noir. If so, then this film is very subversive by implying that criminality is much more attractive.

However, this production is truly worth viewing despite the reservations noted above. As stated, those scenes portraying the criminal are riveting. And of paramount importance is the acting of the very gifted Richard Basehart, who portrays his character so expressively. His gifts have induced the viewer to consider his brutal character with much thought and even sympathy. In this film, he continues to impress, as he had done in other films noirs: ""The House on Telegraph Hill,"" ""Tension,"" and ""Fourteen Hours.""",1381449600,,2517,5.481958762886598

819418,3,6304239351,"Who knows what makes a guy flip, a guy turn into a flat-out maniac, a stone-cold killer when to all the whole wicked world he looks like a guy who is just a little eccentric, a little bit of a loner, and not a guy who has an immense unfulfilled (unquenchable) grudge against the world. Then a little midnight caper, a little heist,  turns sour, a cop gets a little suspicious since there have been a ton of burglaries and robberies in the neighborhood and the guy goes crazy, and the cop winds up dead, very dead.

Of course when a cop gets killed other cops are ready to work night and day 24/7/365 to bring the culprit to justice and it that process of bringing that stone-cold psycho killer to justice that drives this little film noir police procedural, He Walked By Night. They don't start with much to work with since our psycho was very smart, had a sophisticated scheme, and was very knowledgeable about what the cops were up to as they closed in on him. And that in the end was his undoing as some very ordinary back-filling police work leads to his identification.

Funny as classically well done as this film is as a police procedural (getting the bad guys after all is what crime film noir is all about) it was not at all clear why our culprit turned on society and that failing takes away from each of the actions to try to corral him. So we will definitely have to put this in the B-film files although the scenes at the end when the cops corral our mad monk psycho are very evocative of other famous chase scenes (think The Third Man).",1356912000,,1550,4.337931034482758

Second: the impeccable and original performance of Richard Basehart as the smart killer, a brilliant but perverse mind that sets the police officers at the verge of desperation due he doesn't let a simple clue; a lonely man whose only partner is his loyal dog. Third: the dynamic of the script, agile and direct without unneccesary dialogues, revealing the policial procedures so in vogue in the late Forties. Four: the final chase of so many similarities with ""The third man"" and the progressive tension you live in those ten final minutes.

Primary I don't like very much film noir's in documentary style - but this one was really better than I thought. With other words: it was really thrilling how the cops hunting ""Roy"" (Richard Basehart) and Scott Brady as Marty is very good looking and attractive. No its interesting to see the work of the police departement but also to see ""Roy's"" side.

Very interesting: in a very small role can be seen two former child actors: Rex Downing ...Young Hoodlum (uncredited) who's famous as young Heathcliff in ""Wuthering Hights"" (1939) and Tommy Kelly as ""Young Hoodlum aka Redhead"" (uncredited) who was Tom Sawyer in 1938 ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"". Tommy Kelly was also a boy in a band in ""Gone with the wind"".

So far very nice to see those actors in this movie.

819520,5,6304239351,"HE WALKED BY NIGHT (1948)

""All units, all units in the vicinity of State Street and Santa Monica Boulevard proceed at once to 5057 State Street, five-oh five seven State Street. An officer shot. Code 3."" The dragnet is cast and all points are notified. But what officers Marty Brennan (Scott Brady) and Chuck Jones find is a mortally wounded patrolman. The wounded officer had noticed a suspicious character outside a radio/television supply company. Upon bracing the fellow the unfortunate policeman is overwhelmed and fatally shot.

Thus begins an intriguing story of a cunning, resourceful criminal. Someone who, had he not turned toward his ""left hand endeavors"", might have been a successful inventor or electronics engineer. HE WALKED BY NIGHT is a film that works on several levels. It's a fine police procedural drama (supposedly based on a true story). It truly delves deep into the dark avenues of noir. Richard Basehart, as the clever burgler turned cop killer Roy Martin, is really great in this role. Were it not for the fact that he has brutally murdered a policeman (with a wife and family) one might almost feel sorry for him, hounded as he is, relentlessy to his death.

The cat-and-mouse-chase is very well presented. Martin adapts to every situation and has devised clever ways to elude capture. When necessary, the killer can easily change his modus operandi. He begins a score of armed robberies using various disguises. He employs the ""vast and intricate"" system of storm drains underneath LA streets as his cache for weapons, stolen goods and as a very effective avenue of escape.

Jack Webb, as a police lab specialist, is instrumental in helping with the case by identifying tell-tall ejection marks on discarded shell casings found at three different crime scenes. Other techniques are used such as a spot-on composite sketch of the suspect and lab analysis of nitro-glycerin discovered in Martin's discarded bag of tricks. The volatile material had been cleverly desensitized to average jostling but explosive when needed. Clearly this was no run of the mill hoodlum they were after. Whit Bissell (as an unwitting accomplice in Martin's larcenies) is at his mousey best. He's guilty of stealing some scenes. Fine actor.

Alfred L. Werker was given directorial credit but it's widely known that this was indeed Anthony Mann's film. The cinematography, by John Alton, is superb! Especially brilliant are the sequences shot in the tunnels underneath Los Angeles. It makes me wonder if Carol Reed might have been influenzed by this film as it preceeds THE THIRD MAN by one year.

The film may have minor flaws but all-in-all it maintains an air of realism throughout. I saw this film years ago and it is to my shame that I didn't notice the quality of it then. Look out top ten list, I'm going to have to rearrange you once again!

""I didn't ask for a collection of fingers, just fingerprints."" Captain Breen (Roy Roberts) dryly commenting on an explosives test conducted with the comfiscated nito-glycerin. Roy Roberts played Captain Huxley in the Gale Storm/Zazu Pitts vehicle ""Oh, Sussannah""

Trivia: Jack Webb, struck up a friendship with a police technical advisor on this film, and was inspired to create the radio and (later) television program Dragnet. ""I was working daywatch out of homicide. My name is Friday. I carry a badge.""",1277683200,2,3362,5.001788908765653
819521,4,6304239351,"To me, the best thing about this DVD is that it is full of good film noir photography with lots of nighttime shots and many shadows, not only outdoors but indoors and even in the Los Angeles sewer system!

It's great to see an excellent transfer on DVD of this film. That transfer is a ""must"" with all those dark scenes.  John Alton, the cinematographer who worked with Anthony Mann on a couple of other film noirs, did the camera-work and he was one of the best.

Richard Basehart plays a convincing no-conscience killer. He as very interesting to watch all the way through. It also was entertaining to see a young Jack Webb play a forensics-type cop. This was his pre-Dragnet television show period but this was a good vehicle for his cop work. In fact, this movie even had a Dragnet feel to it with some kooky minor characters, such as the lady talking to the milkman/cop.

This movie dragged a bit in the middle segment but overall was entertaining enough to recommend, especially to film noir fans. Just make sure you see this with a good print.",1235088000,,1050,4.510526315789473
819522,4,6304239351,"A really surprisingly suspenseful movie.  Basehart plays the sociopathic thief perfectly.  He makes for a truly creepy and riveting villain.  The rest of the cast, with perhaps the exception of Bissell's performance, is pretty forgettable, but the film's star seems is L.A. itself, its buildings, neighborhoods, underground tunnels.  The shots of the city in the beginning are quite breathtaking.  I think the movie would have benefitted from developing the characters a bit more, but the film succeeds as a sophisticated chase story.  I love watching classic mysteries where the police don't have DNA evidence and all of the sophisticated resources the characters in shows like CSI do; they primarily use their wits, and old-fashioned methods like dusting for fingerprints.  ""He Walked by Night"" is a worthy predecessor to crime television and to movies like ""Zodiac.""  Highly recommended!",1232755200,,890,5.445255474452555
819523,4,6304239351,"Everybody ought to know by now that director Alfred Werker's semi-documentary police procedural ""He Walked By Night"" with Richard Basehart and Scott Brady, inspired Jack Webb's classic radio and television crime series ""Dragnet."" The evocative, film noir photography of the late great John Alton, who also lensed a couple of John Sturges films ""Mystery Street"" and ""The People Against O'Hara"" as well as Richard Brooks' ""Elmer Gantry,"" gives this lean, mean 1949 thriller an edge that neither its budget nor its action could have achieved in tandem. Alton's photography makes ""He Walked By Night"" the memorable experience that it remains. Good acting by all involved bolsters the film's credibility, especially a low-key Basehart registering brilliantly as a contemplative homicidal killer with a pet dog. The dog humanizes Basehart's elusive killer. The most overlooked performance is Whit Bissell as the timid electronics factory owner. Other commentators have provided relevant historical background for this atmospheric melodrama and they are worth reading if the historical background appeals to you. The noted film scholar Jeanne Basinger in her exemplary book about director Anthony Mann writers settles the issue of the directorial authorship of ""He Walked By Night."" She points out that Werker received final credit for ""He Walked By Night,"" but Mann helmed all the scenes with Richard Basehart. Clearly, ""He Walked By Night"" qualifies more as a Mann film than a Werker effort. Critics have never ballyhooed this low-budget, superbly made, minor urban crime thriller, and this lack of critical recognition is really unfortunate. ""He Walked By Night"" provides top-drawer suspense entertainment in virtually every department. The only objectionable scene here involves a couple of detectives grilling a Chinese suspect. Not only does the man not know English, but also the detectives look like idiots for questioning someone that clearly doesn't understand English.

""He Walked by Night"" unfolds with several long shots of a Los Angeles city map. ""Racket Squad"" actor Reed Hadley delivers the prototypical description of L.A. that would open each ""Dragnet"" episode over similar shots. Afterward, Mann takes us first to the Hollywood Police Division where we learn that ""He Walked By Night"" is ""the case history of a killer."" The scene shifts to a dark, quiet. tree-lined street late one evening in Hollywood. An immaculately dressed Roy Martin (Richard Basehart of ""Moby Dick"") is prowling dark streets and casing an electronics shop. Equipped with lock-picking tools, he is about to commit burglary when an off-duty cop heading home, Office Robert Rawlins (John McGuire of ""Flamingo Road""), spots him. Rawlins pulls over and questions him. When he asks to see some identification, Rawlins isn't prepared for the reception that he receives. Martin produces a gun from his suit and blasts away. Swiftly, the killer scrambles to his car, while Rawlins struggles to fire shots at him. In a desperate bid to stop Martin, Rawlins guns his sedan. Swerves it across the street and smashes into Martin's stolen car before he can get it cranked. Witnesses provide the authorities with a description, but Martin shaves off the pencil-thin mustache and begins on his next criminal endeavor. Later, we learn that Rawlins has died from his gunshot wounds.

When he isn't committing crimes, Martin modifies his stolen equipment and then rents it out to Reeves Electronics Laboratory run by Paul Reeves (a bespectacled Whit Bissell) who urges Roy to join his firm. Roy brings in his television projection set and leaves before the original owner arrives. The owner identifies the equipment and calls the police. At this point, Captain Breen (Roy Roberts of ""My Darling Clementine"") assigns Sgt. Marty Brennan (Scott Brady of ""Dollars"") and Sgt. Chuck Jones (James Cardwell of ""The Sullivans"") to the case and they question Reeves. Martin calls up and Reeves tells him that he has sold his television projector. Jones gets Reeves to tell Martin that he has his dough ready and to come in that night and pick it up. Later, Martin surprises everybody that night and shoots Jones, paralyzing him and knocking Brennan unconscious. In the process, however, Martin is wounded by Jones. In a scene that predates ""First Blood,"" Martin digs out the slug himself with sterilized doctor's tools. Meanwhile, the crime technician, Lee (Jack Webb of ""Dragnet"") gradually pieces together information about Martin until Brennan suggests that he use something that allows witnesses of Martin's robberies to create a picture of him. It seems that Martin has been on a robbery spree and uses the storm drainage system underneath Los Angeles to escape from the authorities.

Anyway, Captain Breen relieves Brennan from the case since the latter has made no headway in capturing Martin and Breen is feeling the heat from his own superiors. Later, during one of his visits with the recuperating Jones, Brennan learns that the Breen is trying to rattle him enough to come up with a fresh approach to the case. Brennan starts looking where he didn't before--in the surrounding police departments. Eventually, he uncovers Martin's secret and his real name Roy Morgan. Breen masquerades as a milk man and finds where Morgan lives. The long arm of the law assembles with cops, guns, and tear gas to flush Morgan out. Predictably, Morgan flees to the storm drainage system with the LAPD in hot pursuit. They don't aim to let him escape their clutches again! This tightly-knit thriller is pretty good, even by 1948 standards. The police are depicted like idiots during the first hour because they constantly underestimated the resourceful adversary who even keeps a shotgun stored in the underground drain system. John Alton creates a marvelous sense of atmosphere with images that highlight the area above the heads of the participants. The photography in the storm drainage system is terrific stuff! Scott Brady is good as the cop determined to bust Morgan, and his Sgt. Brennan's one characteristic that is emphasized is his shortage of matches for his cigarette habit.

How this minor league studio produced such a realistic vision of Los Angeles noir is amazing.  The acting, camera work, script, lighting, sets, and final print leaves little to be desired.  A bit more plot intrigue would have earned this film a 5 star rating and a place alongside noir masterpieces such as The Asphalt Jungle, The Killers, and Out of the Past.

819593,5,6304239351,"""He Walked by Night"" is a 1948 black-and-white film noir crime drama that was shot in semi-documentary style and inspired one of the film's actors, Jack Webb, to create the radio and later television program Dragnet, which the film clearly resembles. This movie seems to be ahead of its time in several ways. Unlike other crime dramas of the thirties and forties, there is a lack of hammy dialog, no girl with a heart of gold standing behind her man - either criminal or police officer, and no background information given explaining the criminal's motivation, or any of the other plot gimicks that run from the early talkie gangster films into the crime dramas of the post-war era. Also, there is no mystery for the audience to solve, as the actions of the police and the criminal are clearly shown to the audience. The only question is when and how their paths will finally cross.

Richard Basehart, who portrays criminal Roy Martin in this film, really owns the movie. He shines as a relentless sociopath whose only tender spot seems to be for his own dog. Because he doesn't associate with known criminals and lives quietly, he is exceptionally hard to track down. Basehart actually has very few lines, but he is great at expressing his state of mind through his gestures and facial expressions. The film's excellent cinematography surrounds Basehart's character with cold, deterministic pools of light and darkness so that he really does seem like some type of shadow of evil that has descended upon the city. The killer in the film was actually based on real-life criminal Erwin Walker. However, wanting to concentrate on both the crime solving techniques involved and the habits of the criminal, this interesting and lengthy backstory was omitted to keep the film tight and fast paced.

Erwin Walker was a brilliant student at the California Institute of Technology, a radio dispatcher for the police department in his native Glendale, and something of a hero as a lieutenant in charge of a radar unit on Okinawa during World War II. Walker returned from overseas duty deeply disturbed, and set out on a crime spree of more than a dozen holdups and burglaries to raise money for construction of a ""death ray machine"" that he thought would somehow make another war impossible. Twice Walker shot his way out of police traps, escaping through the labyrinth of storm drain pipes under Los Angeles and eventually killing a police officer. He was sentenced to death, but was later found to be insane by prison psychiatrists, and his execution was postponed indefinitely. California governor Pat Brown commuted his sentence to life in 1961, and in 1971 Walker was granted a new trial due to his  original confession having been found to be coerced. Remarkably, he was acquitted at the second trial, changed his name, married, and took a job as a chemist somewhere in Southern California, never to be heard from publicly again.

Thus, just or unjust, the inspiration for this movie had quite a different outcome than the villain in the film. Of course, in 1948, nobody would have dared write such a screenplay and have expected to ever work in Hollywood again.

Normally, I would recommend one of the Film Noir boxed sets that includes this movie, but I can't seem to find one that has all of my favorites - ""Asphalt Jungle"", ""Scarlet Street"", ""He Walked by Night"" (of course), and ""Clash By Night"". One of my favorite film noir epics that doesn't show up anywhere - either in a box set or an individual DVD or even VHS - is ""Nora Prentiss"", which is truly a classic.",1151625600,3,3566,4.801302931596092
819594,5,6304239351,"You can't possibly begin a discussion about gritty crime dramas without mentioning He Walked by Night, basically the grand-daddy of police procedurals and an obvious inspiration for the classic Dragnet radio and television series (with the radio series beginning a mere four months after this film's release).  Sometimes classified as film noir, He Walked by Night is especially noteworthy for its impressive cinematography (thanks to John Alton) and its semi-documentary-style presentation.  You would never know by looking at it that the film was produced for an independent Poverty Row studio (Eagle-Lion), but one must note that the direction owes more to an uncredited Anthony Mann than it does to Alfred L. Werker.

The story is only concerned with the crimes, the criminal, the pursuit, and the capture.  None of the cops is given much of a personality (ironically, Jack Webb - in a secondary role as a forensics expert - is probably the most personable fellow in the entire film), but that's what makes this style of film so effective.  The L.A. cops who work to track down a man who killed one of their own really represent cops everywhere, straight-laced, fully committed public servants concerned only with doing their jobs and getting bad guys off the streets.  No matter how close an individual detective may be to the case, he goes by the book and puts together the puzzle pieces using the latest forensic technology (including, in this case, the equivalent of an Identikit) and investigative techniques.  Contrast this with the unrealistic cop films of today, which invariably give us a renegade cop who doesn't play by the rules, routinely beats information out of possible informants, and generally makes a mockery of true police work.

The story (based on the real-life story of Erwin ""Machine Gun"" Walker) features Richard Basehart as Roy Martin, an intelligent burglar turned killer who seems to outsmart LAPD at every turn following his murder of a policeman who caught him trying to break into an electronics store.  Captain Breen (Roy Roberts) immediately throws down a dragnet of the area, but the killer is too smart to fall into the trap.  Starting with almost nothing, the cops go to work putting the facts together and seeing where they lead.  They get a break when the killer is linked to an electronics supplier, but they manage to let him slip through their fingers (and permanently injuring yet another cop in the process).  Like any criminal with half a brain, Martin changes his M.O. and uses the city's underground drain pipes to make quick escapes, leaving the authorities baffled.  In realistic fashion, it takes a lot of tedious investigation, forensic evidence, and legwork to break the case - which is really the whole point of the story.

Basehart is superb as the slippery Roy Martin, and the scene wherein he removes a bullet from his own abdomen is a riveting moment which propels the film onto a higher plane.  Martin's not quite the genius the cops make him out to be, for they have only themselves to blame for not catching him much sooner than they do, but Basehart deserves plenty of kudos for making He Walked By Night such a dramatic thriller.  With its innate aura of realism, impressive cinematography and camera work, and solid cast, He Walked By Night is a timeless film of immense influence, putting to shame the unrealistic, rebel with a badge films that increasingly pass for crime dramas today.",1149984000,2,3453,4.948096885813149
819595,4,6304239351,"A fine fim noir feature shot in a documentary style.  The clipped dialogue will have you thinking you are watching an old episode of Dragnet.  Yes, that is Jack Webb in a supporting role as a CSI.This movie is solid on workmanship, just good entertainment for those who like police procedurals.  Very interesting to see a young Richard Basehart in a meaty role with very little dialogue.",1146528000,,387,4.746268656716418
819596,4,6304239351,"Indeed it is!  HWN opens with a nighttime murder of a Los Angeles cop.  Since one of their own has been killed, one would expect LAPD to take an intense interest in finding the perp. And that the boys in blue do, in fine noir style.  Docudramas can be tricky, but that genre is done to virtual perfection here.  At first, the Law has no idea as the bad guy's identity. Solid forensic work pieces the case together; the viewer will get a solid sense of the inner workings of a big city police force.  Richard Basehart, as the alienated loner of the black hat far overshadows the rest of the cast. This guy is a creep. Watch for the scene when he operates on himself to extract a police bullet! There are many solid noir shots of LA streets in the dead of night, dim warehouses, gloomy apartments, and -shades of ""The Third Man""-chases and evasions in dark city sewers. (A previous reviewer actually accused TM Director Carol Reed of lifting the sewer sequences from HWN.  That is totally unwarranted. Either film can stand on its' own and comparisons are unfair to both).  Unaccredited director Anthony Mann and lenser John Alton have produced a truly engrossing, deft and clever detective story in the best noir tradition. Scott Brady and Roy Roberts, with a virtual cameo by Jack Webb, are the dedicated detectives on the job but the cast here is secondary to the movie!  If there is a weak point, it lies in the 79 minute run time. That could have been extended to flesh out some of the detective work but this point is minor.  What happens? A good review doesn't divulge resolutions.  The curious will just have to watch HWN but noir/detective aficionados will not be disappointed. Two closing observations: 1) Why does L.A. always appear so sinister in cop movies? This New Yorker is fascinated. 2) Somehow Director Mann squeezed in some 54 characters in the brief run time.

819597,5,6304239351,"Richard Basehart stars as intelligent and merciless cop killer Roy Martin in the somber, dark and moody film noir thriller ""He Walked by Night"".  Directed by Alfred Werker the film captures the essence of the genre with its superb black and white cinematography provided by John Alton.

Basehart an electronics genius is interrupted breaking into an electronics store and winds up shooting and killing an unlucky L.A. police officer.  This mobilizes a city wide manhunt headed by Capt. Breen played by Roy Roberts and stone faced Scott Brady playing Sgt. Brennan.  The elusive Basehart has been selling sophisticated enhanced stolen electronic equipment through Whit Bissell playing Paul Reeves, owner of a high tech electronics lab.

Using Reeves as bait Brady and his partner Sgt. Jones played by James Cardwell flush out Basehart in Reeves' factory only to have Cardwell get wounded.  Having not much to go on they can't even get a picture of Basehart despite Bissell's description.

Basehart goes on a crime spree carefully altering his identity and using the L.A. storm drain system to evade the police.  Persistent investigative work by Brady finally determines that Basehart has been a civilian employee of the police and they track him down.  Escaping using the storm drains, in a memorable chase scene Basehart is finally cornered by a task force deep beneath the streets of the city.

Filmed in a documentary style and based on a true story, ""He Walked by Night"" was a precursor to the modern day crime stories that were realistic and not aggrandized with that Hollywood touch.",1141776000,,1587,5.069230769230769
819598,4,6304239351,"The introduction to ""He Walked By Night"" opens with the statement ""This is a true story"" and ends with ""Only the names have been changed....to protect the innocent."" If that sounds familiar, it was repeated weekly in the television series ""Dragnet"", for which ""He Walked By Night"" was the inspiration. Jack Webb, who produced and starred in two ""Dragnet"" series in the 1950s and 1960s, plays a forensics expert in this film. The real story behind the movie took place in 1946, when Erwin Walker -World War II veteran, former police department employee, thief and murderer- eluded the Los Angeles police for months.

When a police officer (John McGuire) patrolling the Hollywood beat questions a man he witnessed trying to break into a radio shop, the man shoots him in cold blood. After a citywide dragnet fails to capture the officer's assailant, police Captain Breen (Roy Roberts) assigns the case to Sergeants Marty Brennan and Chuck Jones. They are able to identify the culprit as Roy Martin (Richard Basehart) through an electronics store where he consigns stolen goods, but Martin eludes the police trap. Law enforcement is at a loss to locate a criminal who is clever, resourceful, reclusive, and entirely unknown to the criminal underworld. Until Sergeant Brennan (Scott Brady) has a revelation.

The manhunt and police procedural are narrated by the stentorian voice of Reed Hadley, who narrated perhaps 15 films in his career, including the noir docudramas ""T-Men"" and ""Call Northside 777"". Unlike his pursuers, the audience observes the activities and character of Roy Martin as he is hunted. Martin's only redeeming characteristics are his intelligence and his cute dog, but he nevertheless becomes a sort of anti-hero. We know more about him than we do about the wooden police officers. They are the hunters, but the audience is more captivated by the hunted. Morgan is a real loner, undeniably tough, self-sufficient and intelligent. No matter how bad he is, he is a disillusioned veteran who abandoned legitimate opportunities to be a career criminal, constantly moving, constantly changing his m.o., both hunter and hunted in a noir world. And the world is closing in on him.

Alfred Walker got the official director's credit on ""He Walked By Night"", but it is generally accepted that Anthony Mann directed most of the film. Famed cinematographer John Alton is responsible for lighting and filming the extensive night sequences. I often find Alton's lighting to be too showy, but not in this case. The chase sequence through storm sewers is incredible and a must-see if you're interested in classic film noir lighting. John Alton's lighting and Richard Basehart's laconic villain/anti-hero make ""He Walked By Night"" memorable among many fine docudramas of its era. There are no bonus features on the MGM 2003 DVD. Subtitles are available in English, French, and Spanish.",1122163200,12,2886,5.136170212765958
819599,5,6304239351,Richard Baseheart rules in this superb crime drama based on a true story. It's a must see!!!!,1118620800,,93,4.529411764705882
819878,5,6304239351,"While Alfred Werker was credited with directing this brilliant 1948 noir classic, it was low budget genius Anthony Mann who helmed most of it, using a brilliant semi-documentary style to place viewers inside a Los Angeles police station to view strategy and feel personally involved in investigative tactics.

This was the style that Jack Webb, who plays a crack crime lab specialist, would hone to perfection on radio and then on television in his brilliantly successful ""Dragnet"" series, which was the mother of ""Law and Order"" and other current television shows dealing with a semi-documentary approach to solving crimes.  Another key influence on Webb was Jules Dassin's ""The Naked City"", also released in 1948, which covered the New York crime scene in the same way that Webb would showcase Los Angeles, and that Mann did in ""He Walks by Night.""

Richard Basehart played the solitary cop killer to perfection.  He had performed superbly in a similar role one year earlier in ""Repeat Performance"" as a young psycho, which was his film debut.  Viewers see the solitary desperation in Basehart, someone who cares only for electronics and his dog.  His interception of police messages, obtained through his technical skills, enables him to stay one jump ahead of authorities for a significant period of time.

Scott Brady is convincing as the partner of an officer who was badly wounded by Basehart and friend of another policeman who was killed by him after being stopped during what was thought to be a routine investigation.  He bristles with rage as he works non-stop to corral the brutal and brilliantly psychopathic cop killer on behalf of the victims he knew so well.

The story is based on a true-life case that was unsolved by the LAPD.  Mann plays up the noir feature convincingly with dark and brooding photography.  Basehart roams the streets of Los Angeles in the darkness of night as a clever and deadly prowling animal.  Citizens serve as beasts or prey and police officers prove particularly sought after targets by a ruthlessly inventive criminal intent on outsmarting those seeking to catch him.",1115337600,,2114,5.025787965616046
819879,4,6304239351,"... with only the names changed to protect the innocent'...does this sound familiar?  Some have likened He Walked by Night (1948) to the 50's television series Dragnet, and there are some similarities (one of the biggest being both feature Jack Webb), but this film differs from that popular series in that the focus is one the story, with emphasis placed both on the detective work and the elusive criminal, generally featuring the criminal more prominently, while Dragnet tended to deal more with the character of Joe Friday, with his no nonsense demeanor, and his partner, cracking whatever case may lay before them for that week, in my opinion.  I've read that a police department advisor to this film actually suggested to Webb (who had a detective radio show at the time) that he do a radio series based on actual police files, and from this came the idea for Dragnet, which eventually evolved into the television series.

Directed by Alfred L. Werker (apparently Anthony Mann, a name known to noir fans, directed a good part of this film, uncredited), the film stars Richard Basehart, who played Ishmael to Gregory Peck's Captain Ahab in the 1956 version of Moby Dick, but is probably most well known for his vast television credentials spanning the late 50's up until the early 80's prior to his death in 1984 of a stroke (a few of the, in fact).  Also appearing is Scott Brady (The Law vs. Billy the Kid), Roy Roberts (Chinatown), Whit Bissell (Target Earth), James Cardwell (The Return of the Whistler), and, as I mentioned before, Jack Webb (Dragnet).

The film starts off with the slaying of a police officer as he stopped on his way home late one night to investigate a suspicious looking character (Basehart) trying to gain entry into an electronics store.  After a confrontation, the police begin an extensive manhunt for the would be thief, now killer (the police get really rattled when one of their own gets killed, I figure as if you're nutty or desperate enough to kill a cop, you'd probably do just about anything).  Anyway, the descriptions of the killer are vague at best, and the police (after drudging up every ne'er-do-well they can lay hands on) find the killer is no ordinary criminal, but a very intelligent, wily fellow who is a master at covering his tracks, among other things.  The initial investigation turns up bupkiss, forcing the authorities to work over again and again whatever small clues they have, and to also develop different methods for locating this calculating character.  After exhaustively following up new leads uncovered by some rather ingenious investigation, the killer's trail begins to grow warm again, and soon they're hot on his heels, but he won't be taken easily, as he's still has a few tricks up his sleeve.  It's a deadly game of cat and mouse (although sometimes, I wondered who was the cat, and who was the mouse?).

One aspect I found interesting about this movie was that it tended to shy away from focusing too much on the characters, but more on the story itself.  After the initial crime, a lot of time is spent on detailing the efforts of the long, and sometimes tedious, investigation by the police, with plenty of ominous voice over providing expository information for the viewer.  We see that police work is comprised of not of lucky guesswork, but thorough, investigative, sometimes inventive (look for the scene where the witnesses are called upon to provide a composite of the individual believed to have committed a number of crimes) techniques used in the identification and locating processes.  We also get a look into the inner workings of a meticulous, intelligent criminal, his means and methods for always managing to stay one step ahead of the authorities (I especially enjoyed the scene where he had to operate on himself, removing a slug from his side after a close call with the police...one thing about the criminal world, adequate healthcare can be difficult to obtain, especially when dealing with gunshot wounds, as nosey hospitals are prone to ask way too many questions).  I will say this...that Richard Basehart was certainly more spry at the age of 34 (that's how old he was when he appeared here) than I am, running his behind off and flinging himself down sewer drains (he used the large and expansive Los Angeles sewer system as a means to travel).  I thought all the actors did a fine job, making their appearances blend in nicely as not to overshadow the main element, that being the actual story, as I think was the intent.  Basehart provides a wonderful performance as the emotionless, shadowy, hard to finger criminal baffling the police at nearly ever turn.  Jack Webb does appear briefly, as a forensic scientist, offering information he obtained from weapons and equipment confiscated from the criminal car, as he had to leave it behind during an escape.  The film is listed in the `noir' genre, and there are some techniques indicative of that genre utilized throughout, but it seems more than what it is, as the movie plays more like a brooding documentary, relating actual events, rather than developing a fictitious story with hard-boiled characters, although I will say the ending is certainly in line with what one would expect within the genre-a stark, cold, unrepentant, finale, highlighting superior cinematic techniques, excellent lighting, and recognizable L.A. locations used throughout the film.

The full screen (original aspect ratio) picture provided by MGM on this DVD looks amazing, and the audio is very sharp (the echoing footsteps in sewer scenes sound wonderful and create a real level of suspense suitable for the climatic ending).  There are chapter stops and English subtitles, but no special features available, which didn't bother me, given the excellent quality of the transfer and of the film itself.  Worth looking into if you like solid, entertaining crime dramas.

819881,2,6304239351,"He Walked by Night is okay, but it isn't classic film noir.
If you want to see how Jack Webb's TV show Dragnet developed its style, this police procedural is the blueprint.  Oddly (considering his wooden TV acting), here Jack Webb plays the most interesting cop.  Webb is a CSI-type, spending his time in the laboratory comparing bullet striations and playing with explosives.  The tough-guy detectives make fun of his soft-spoken manner.  He lets the neanderthals mock him because he knows he's smarter than they are.
Except for Richard Basehart's insane killer techno-wizard, the acting is mediocre.  You see a couple of the character actors who became regulars in Webb's repertory company for Dragnet.
When a cop is killed, the LAPD rounds up every male alone on the the streets.  They roust men out of hotels and arrest everyone who looks suspicious.  They handcuff all the scum together and drag them downtown.  But they don't get the guy who actually killed the cop because he's a good-looking young white war veteran and doesn't resemble the types they instinctively go after.
As the narrator speaking to us from 1948 describes how the police go about rounding up all these lowlifes, he assumes we won't worry about any rights of theirs that are being violated.  After all, it's only been seven years since Japanese-Americans were rounded up and put in camps.
When the cops try to interrogate an old Chinese man dressed like he walked in from a Fu Manchu movie, they can't hide their exasperation at his speaking his own language.
I expected there to be more to Richard Basehart's character.  When the police first discover his scientific equipment and weapons, it looks like he's been planning something big, but nothing ever comes of it.
We never find out why someone so intelligent became a thief and killer.  Because he uses the sewers under Los Angeles to avoid the police, I expected one (admittedly overdramatic) ending, but the police just track him down.
The ending is flat.  You don't feel that justice is served, or order restored.",1085961600,3,2049,4.890173410404624
819882,5,6304239351,"Roy Martin (Richard Basehart) is as cold as an ice pick and as ruthless as teflon.  Martin is a burglar, an extortionist, and worst of all, he's a cop killer.
  Alfred Werker's HE WALKED BY NIGHT is a taut, moody police procedural.  Some have called it a film noir, but it lacks certain key elements to merit that brand.  In noir the cops are usually as corrupt as the bad guys.  HWBN lacks that moral ambiguity. We never doubt that Martin is evil and the cops are good.  Noirs also delight in probing the psyche of the protagonist. HWBN keeps it lead character at arm's length.  Martin is a creature of the shadows and the sewers, half emerging into the light only long enough to extort or kill.  There's not a shot in this movie that is taken from his point of view.  Even when the scene includes only Martin and his dog we're kept at a distance.  We're detached observers rather than participants.  HWBN wants to exterminate rather than examine and explain.  Evil can't be understood by the good, but it can be eliminated.
 I wouldn't pick at this point if MGM didn't call HE WALKED BY NIGHT ""this film noir classic"" on the dvd jacket.  The difference between HWBN and film noir is as great as the difference between Faulkner and Hemingway, and fans of the genre shouldn't be misled.
 If you looking for comparisons, DRAGNET is a lot more appropriate.  Jack Webb has a small role in here, and it was while working on this movie he met the LAPD technical advisor who helped him develop Dragnet for radio (it debuted shortly after the movie opened.)  As it goes in most police procedurals, the bad guy is too clever by half and the good guys can prevail only after a painstaking investigation and a slow accumulation of evidence.
 What HWBN does share with film noir is a gritty, alienating, urban setting and evocative light-and-shadow photography.  Los Angeles is presented here as cold and lifeless, filled with anonymous cottages and enormous storm tunnels.
  That said, HE WALKED BY NIGHT is a wonderful movie.  Basehart is icily effective as the loner killer.  The semi-documentary feeling and naturalistic acting styles employed are just right for the subject matter.  If you don't find yourself running out of the room every time an old Dragnet or a newer CSI comes on, you might just enjoy this one.",1085875200,7,2309,4.6419753086419755
819883,5,6304239351,"In response to Jammmer's (from Wyoming) review, let me begin by saying that the prerequisite for liking this movie has nothing to do with ""Dragnet."" I've seen many, many episodes of ""Dragnet,"" and except for the presence of Jack Webb and a similar overall format, this movie is very little like ""Dragnet"" (and I doubt that Jammmer has even seen an ""original"" ""Dragnet"" episode). I addition, the cops in this movie are not portrayed as ""wonder-boy saints."" They are portrayed as regular human beings who make mistakes and even get killed (or seriously injured) on the job. This was done to rebel against the super-hero image that cops had been given in Hollywood for a long time, and I'm surprised that such an apparent ""expert"" in classic films like Jammmer couldn't figure that out. Along these lines, the acting was kept restrained to give the police a less glamorous image, but what I'd like to know is how people like Jammmer expect cops on the job to act. Should they tell some jokes, shed a tear, or chase a dame while they are on a routine job? Look at everyday people's faces while they are working and that is what you are supposed to see on the cops in this movie. In addition, this movie is a semi-documentary that is supposed to illustrate a real crime scene. When police go after crooks, they do not immediately know the crooks' motives, or other things that Jammmer wishes this movie would illustrate. Jammmer's comments and others like it simply prove that many people cannot grasp the original concept of this movie. But I can and the movie pulls it off excellently.",1080172800,4,1582,4.673835125448028
819884,3,6304239351,"Well--some reviewers consider ""He Walked By Night"" a masterpiece--at least one other reviewer called it ""pathetic"". From my three stars, you can guess that I am somewhere between these two extreme views. I can think of a number of 40s ""film noir"" melodramas that are superior to this one, but I still found it an interesting way of passing 80 minutes.
With respect to acting honours, it is no contest. This is Richard Basehart's movie, hands down. His cold-blooded killer is a very different animal to some of the rough-looking types
( hello Rondo Hatton ) that inhabit some of these movies. We are reminded that, years before his TV fame on ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea "", Richard Basehart was a very fine actor. I agree that most of the actors portraying ""LA's finest"" are stone-faced, cardboard cut-outs--Scott Brady and, of course, Jack Webb are wooden in the extreme. I thought that Roy Roberts fared a bit better, expressing emotion that seemed to be beyond the grasp of those zombies reporting to him. B-movie regular, Whit Bissell, is appropriately nervous as an electronics dealer, who finds he has been doing business with a killer. Also, if you are a B-movie buff, you will spot Kenneth Tobey as a cop, just a couple of years away from his encounter with ""The Thing From Another World"", and several other nasty, sci/fi creatures.
I found the shots of LA in the 40s very interesting, and I love old cars, so the historical aspect was a plus for me. Of course, we are decades away from computers, so police methods in this film will seem very quaint to younger viewers. The ""profile"" scene is well done--various citizens are called in to help the police determine what Mr. Basehart looks like, and the results are very effective.
The movie does generate a lot of suspense, and the final showdown in the drainage tunnels is well done.
The DVD has a nice black and white picture--mono sound of course. If you like old-fashioned crime films, that do not wear out their welcome, this modestly-priced disc would fit in your collection. I would also not want to discourage MGM--or any other company--from issuing films of this type and vintage.",1077321600,17,2151,4.738666666666667
819885,5,6304239351,"I think mostly everything that needs to be said about this particular film noir classic has been said before, in other previous reviews. I am adding to the review selection only to tell film buffs that the MGM released DVD of Dec. 2nd 2003, is absolutely superior to any previous DVD release for this film. Apparently MGM had the original negative, or at least a top notch print the whole time. For a 55 year old film, this DVD release is excellent, and at a great price. Throw the Alpha, or the Film Noir Of Anthony Mann version to the side. This is the real deal! Great film noir, and a great quality dvd to boot. No extras, but a nice black and white print at a bargain price.",1071446400,44,679,4.271317829457364
819886,5,6304239351,"The Dragnet overlay functions like Fritz Lang/M's web of entrapment for the mysterious Basehart character.  We never find out why he does anything that he does.  I'm especially baffled and intrigued by his need to steal cutting edge electronic equipment and then have Whit Bissell sell it as Basehart's own invention.  What gives with that?  And the previous reviewer's comment about B and his dog is right on target: it's extremely touching: B and his dog, in that lonely apartment, all alone. Probably Alton's masterwork.  Interesting companion piece: Basehart's Tension, where he's a cuckolded milquetoast pharmacist who changes identity to get revenge--but with unexpected results.",981763200,5,685,5.485714285714286

 A great, chilling film, great cast, IT couldn't be a more perfect noir experience unfortunately this release was yet another public domain version  and as such, the transfer is very disappointing especially considering it was shot by one of the great Directors of Photography, JOHN ALTON Take a look at the ""Big Combo"" and you can see what a master of noir lighting and camera placement ALTON was. If you have never seen this film, you can't go wrong for it's $5 and change cost but if you want to see this film restored to it's original look, this is not the version (is there a restored version?)

This is a true story, only the names were changed to protect the innocent. Los Angeles was the fastest growing city in the nation, 452 square miles. An off-duty policeman noticed a man near a closed store. He asks for identification, and is shot by this prowler. The police stations are called and the police set up a dragnet to arrest anyone in the area and question them. Hotels in a four mile area and anyone on the street were brought in for questioning. [No probable cause?] Most were let go, the one sought wasn't caught. They search the MO file to find burglars who use picklocks; no success.

We learn Roy Martin is an ace electronics technician whose machines are leased to customers (reflecting post-war scarcity). One of them was stolen. The police are called and they set a trap. But Roy suspects something and arrives early. There is an exchange of shots and Roy is wounded but escapes to operate on himself! The police learn Roy worked for the Signal Corps. Now Roy begins a new career as a liquor store bandit (cash only, no credit as in small grocery stores). He learned to escape through the storm sewer system of Los Angeles, an underground highway. The police gather the crime victims to develop a picture of the robber. Wanted posters were sent out, but nobody knew this unknown subject. Roy eludes the police and sees a businessman to rob him. The police assign a new team to catch a man who has no friends, no records, no fingerprints, and can outsmart the police. The wounded officer comes up with a clue to find this seeming genius, Finally they get a suspect and a name! The detective tracks him down disguised as a milkman.

The police silently surround Roy's bungalow. His dog senses the strangers and barks a warning. But Roy escapes into his attic and jumps to another roof. When the police pursue, Roy jumps into the underground storm drain system to escape. The police arrange for converging columns, and Roy is trapped by a parked car. There is an exchange of shots, and Roy ceases to resist. The idea of a criminal who knows police procedure must be a bad dream for the police. Yet there are examples of this in some true crime stories. Jack Webb, who played a minor role here, went on to stardom in the ""Dragnet"" dramas on radio and television in the 1950s. This story could be a primer on police procedure. One significance of this film are the scenes of an extinct Los Angeles. Sparse traffic, sunny skies, no smog, small businesses, etc. are all gone. [The scenes of the hunt in the storm sewer system seems to be echoed in Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"".]",1491004800,,2622,4.5508474576271185
