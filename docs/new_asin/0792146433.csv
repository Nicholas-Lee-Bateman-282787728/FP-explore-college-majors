123549,4,0792146433,"My whole working life was on evening shift so it wasn't until I retired that I was able to watch any Star Trek series. At least I can pick and choose now. The main advantage of DS9 is that that dreadful Shatner is not on it. The plots are usually interesting if some times too far out. There are more characters in this series, so greater variety of plots. The ridiculous aliens have disappeared and the new aliens much more refined in look. Westmore does an excellent job as usual. DS9 is good entertainment although I have turned off several episodes which have turned to be too boring, too tedious, or too silly. It's nice that Quark is getting more air time. The series is often too heavy and Quark is good for a laugh with his evil intensity. Yes, I recommend this series. It will not change the world but is good for an evening of  entertainment and Rock on, Odo.",1483315200,,869,4.364197530864198

123557,5,0792146433,"Of all the other Star Trek television series, this one is my favorite. I don't know if I can really explain the reason for this or not. To begin with it is not just another series taking place aboard a starship with a captain, a 2nd in command and a loyal crew, which is rather refreshing in many ways. Since DS 9 takes place aboard a space station this seems to bring more reality and depth than the bridge or a starship. I have other reasons but, one of the main reasons is, I like the characters and the roles they play. They seem to provide something which makes the program seem special, at least to me. Their lives, exploits and feelings are somewhat different from the characters of other star trek programs, and the things they become involved with or in, just seems to make everything more interesting and more likable to me than the more liberal minded Star Trek the Next Generation, or even the original Star Trek which is one of my favorites. To sum it all up and I'm certainly no qualified writer, nor critic. I simply like it better than the others.",1481932800,3,1063,4.401015228426396

123608,5,0792146433,"I watched season 5, episode 22, Children of Time.  It's not my favorite DS9 episode, but I find that saying one episode of a series is your favorite is very hard to do.  There are usually many.  What I like about this one is how the series explored the idea of time travel, alternate realities, feelings and sacrifice.  This theme (or group of themes) is found in many episodes of all five (6 if you count the animated series) of the Star Trek universe.  Just to name one from each series, it includes The City on the Edge of Forever, Yesterday's Enterprise, Duet, Timeless and Carpenter Street.  They all involve one or more of the themes I mentioned.  I certainly recommend this episode and all of the alternate universe episodes (the ""mirror"" universe established in the original series).",1478736000,,791,4.688405797101449

123922,5,0792146433,"The Fifth Season of Star Trek Deep Space Nine broke all the records for me. After stumbling a bit thru the first two seasons it really caught on by Season Three and Four.

I will list my Baker's Dozen best episodes from start to finish with some honorable mentions as well. These episodes will be listed in order of appearance. This will make things easier for the DVD viewer. As of this writing I will be the 376th person to review this fine series.

Baker's Dozen Best Season Five Episodes
""Apocalypse Rising"" takes off from the series finale of Season Four. Odo and crew go after a Changeling that they believe is Gowron. Or is he? I liked ""Looking For Parmach In All the Wrong Places."" It reintroduces Grilka and she and Quark consummate their relationship, much to the chagrin of Worf. The relationship Dax has with Worf is finally consummated too. This episode had bits of comedy and comic relief in it. ""Nor the Battle to the Strong"" may well have been one of the four or five best of the season. It showed how Jake dealt with and confronted his fears when facing his own mortality. An absolute gem! ""Trials & Tribbleations"" was a technological masterpiece. I never saw it when it was originally  broadcast but did see it as a rerun and was astounded by what was achieved on Star Trek's 30th anniversary. This year is the 50th anniversary of Star Trek and all I can say is: Wow! We have come so far with our technologies! It all looked so real. ""The Ascent"" looks at first to be another ""crash landing"" episode but this gives us so much more character background for Quark and Odo's love-hate relationship they have for one another. ""Rapture"" is the episode that Doctor Bashir has been replaced by a Changeling. This is the episode where they switched over to the new (Ugly) uniforms from the previous ones (More On That Later). I greatly liked ""Rapture"" and found it to be of great interest. Captain Sisko too (As Regards Bajoran Artifacts) is an archaeologist (As Is Captain Picard). ""The Darkness & the Light"" was an incredible episode and very dark for Star Trek. How could the Cardassian kill so many people from light year(s) away from DS9? That aspect of the plot was lacking but not the actual acting by Nana Visitor. She was incredible in this episode. seeing her friends die was difficult for me to accept as I'd grown to love them. ""For the Uniform"" was an incredible episode and one that I could not really find myself agreeing with Sisko as I truly supported the Maquis who were oppressed people. I did not look at them as ""terrorists"" but freedom fighters. The two part story called: ""In Purgatory's Shadow"" and ""By Inferno's Light"" were absolutely incredible! The two episodes complimented each other perfectly. They may well have been the best two part episodes in the Star Trek franchise! ""Blaze of Glory"" and ""Call to Arms"" round out my Baker's Dozen Best Season Five Episodes. The former episode allows Michael Eddington to be redeemed. although I never really felt he was ""bad"" to begin with. He saved Sisko's life along with others of DS9 and served capably until he chose to defect to the Maquis along with the industrial replicators. It turned out it was a blessing in disguise that he did that. Had he not done so they would have fallen into the hands of cardassians and their overlords the Dominion! They should have pointed that out in the show. Call to Arms was the best episode of the season! A tremendous Season Finale that was DS9's best. The final shot of the Defiant and General Martok's Bird of Prey joining the combined Klingon and Federation fleet is one of the greatest special effects shots I've ever seen! The battle fleet was enormous! All kinds of vessels were there including the Galaxy Class starships we all truly loved from The Next Generation.

Why the new and ugly uniforms? It made no sense! Yes, I know the movie had them change for some reason but there was no need for the producers to adopt the new ""film uniforms"" for Star Trek Deep Space Nine. I hated the darker colors and really loved the red and blue and gold. Unfortunately they took that to another level. I'll never agree with that switch.

The worst episodes? I'll name them without going into too much detail. ""Ferengi Love Songs"" ""The Begotten"" and ""Doctor Bashir, I Presume?"" were horrible. The latter being the worst of the bunch. Everything about it seemed to be contrived to ""out"" Julian. No, I can't subscribe to that episode. I'm the 282nd person to give Season Five a Five Star review. Buy this DVD set and you won't be disappointed.",1461974400,,4559,4.616522811344019

124037,5,0792146433,"Of all the Star Trek spin off series, Deep Space Nine is, at least for me, the most complex and layered.  It didn't start off that way, but by the fourth series, with the introduction of the Dominion and the revelation that Odo's people were the rulers of this threat from the Gamma Quadrant, the series really began to cook.  Grand wars, noble but often flawed characters and a the 24th Century equivalent of an old west frontier town in setting, and a fair bit of Bejoran mythology woven into it, this is definitely a series worth revisiting again and again.",1454112000,,560,4.534653465346534

The characters were far more believable, and more human (or their ""alien"" human-equivalents) than the other Star Trek series', with their perfect people.  The Dominion War arc had some of the best plot and character writing, as far as I'm concerned, with the Maquis arc being second to that.  I highly recommend this series, even if you're not a ""Star Trek Fan"", because it's good science fiction and adventure, even if you don't know all the background.

This ain't Captain Picard's ""Star Trek""...",1435968000,,634,4.897196261682243

The comedic dance and odd like/dislike relationship between Quark and Odo develops nicely and the episode The Ascent is a must see for Quark-Odo fans!  The Begotton episode is a heartfelt beautiful episode with the  find of a new baby changeling and the insight of Odo's passed with Dr. Mora- one of the best episodes of DS9!  Warf and Jadzia, Garak and Ziyal, Jake and Nog, Klingons and Cardassians this season has it all and then some!!!",1435968000,,613,4.855769230769231

124378,5,0792146433,"  

Season 5 is a quality season overall, but all you really need to know about it is contained in the 6th episode of the season. It's the one where the DS9 crew travels back in time and finds the ship USS Enterprise 1701 on the day when it finds itself overrun with Tribbles. The DS9 crew has to blend into the background of the original series episode. Excellent CGI is employed to digitally insert Sisko into scenes with James Kirk. And Worf makes an offhand reference to why Klingons in the Original Series era look different than Klingons of the Next Generation era. (No cranial ridges in the original series) that spawns an entire story arc in Star Trek : Enterprise, the final installment of the Trek universe. It's one of the single best episodes of the entire Trek franchise.

As for the storytelling DS9 is probably the best overall story arc in the Trek franchise. While there are a lot of single episode stories, there is an overall story arc that spans the entire series. It's interesting. It's well written. Well made. And it's just good sci-fi and story telling in general. The series long story arc takes a lot of twists and turns but it deals with inter stellar politics and power struggles that the other Trek series only elude to. (Yeah, Captain Picard has a fair amount of diplomatic and military run ins with the Romulans and Klingons, but on Deep Space Nine the series delves much deeper into the politics or all that, and introduces a few new races from the other side of the galaxy into the mix)

If you like the Star Trek franchise, you have to try Deep Space Nine.",1430524800,,1590,4.522648083623693

Start with season 2s finale and take it all the way through to season 7s ending.  The dark brooding atmosphere of the show is excellent, solid acting by principal characters, visual effects that hold up pretty well, epic space battles, and a very long story arc involving a nefarious anti Federation group called The Dominion that tests and shapes all major and minor characters throughout their development.

I didn't even bother returning it because of the cost of posting it back in conjunction with the fact that I have received other seasons with cracks as well. It doesn't surprise me because the casing cracks easy to begin with. Also, the disks themselves are not particularly durable. I have scratched disks from this set just trying to get them out of the casing. They don't come out easily and when they come out, the disks are so flimsy they crack.

I never got into DS9 the first few seasons, but I also didn't much like any of the characters. I really didn't think Avery Brooks was that good of an actor. So, I just stopped watching.
Well, a guy I worked with convinced me that DS9 did get a lot better through the years so I decided to give it another go. I have to say that I was a bit surprised at how many episodes/seasons I did actually see in the past. Quite a lot, actually. Once I finally made to about the middle of season 4 this year, I started actually liking it a lot more. Now that I'm in the middle of season 5, I look forward to watching it.

Many threads progress rapidly and intertwine, and character development becomes more intense for all of the cast but especially for Worf, Dax, Rom, Nog, and Odo. Kira Nerys becomes a pivotal character and her support of Captain Sisko is fierce.

This episode is very important for the relationship between the Klingons and the Federation, and also for the Romulans as they join forces to face the Dominion invasion. Dire circumstances force desperate measures and a shaky alliance.",1384819200,,529,5.223529411764706

We get vignettes of each character in separate episodes (providing much-needed character development so we can bond with the cast.) Ferengi muck is kept to a minimum, and some episodes are really good, though not to the high level of the next and last two seasons, 6 and 7.

Nana Visitor is pregnant for much of the season, and some of the inside jokes are hilarious (as Alexander ""Don't Call me El Fadil"" Siddig is the baby daddy.) One scene I loved had Major Kira pointing at Bashir (Siddig) and yelling ""This is YOUR fault"" which is darned funny. But the pregnancy stuff gets old after a while and the birth is kind of a silly New Age romantic dream of what childbirth should be like (a drum circle, no contraction pains, and no muss or fuss. Breathe deep! Relax! Ahhh. Oh, look, a baby! How did that happen? Women everywhere are going ""Harrumph! That's not like real life and 12 hours of back labor!"")

The writing, acting and storylines are just as good as ST: TNG and Voyager and I particularly appreciate how DS9 was handed the baton, so to speak from, TNG.  Each episode within each season builds from the previous ones and continues to build depth into each character as well as getting their backstories woven in here and there.  The one thing in particular that stands out is the type of father Captain Sisko is.  He is gentle, loving, a good moral role model and actually shows affection towards his son on a regular basis; ie. kissing him on the forehead or cheek, hugging and patting him on the back.  Sisko is a single father, runs the station, is a chef and has a very positive attitude toward life and loves to laugh.

124807,5,0792146433,"One of the things that used to separate the ST universe from the later SF universes (Babylon 5, the new Battlestar Galactica, and everything that has followed) was the divide between the classic television model of ""episodes"" and the newer model of ""story arc told in episodic form."" DSN is like the missing link between these.

The problems with the old style everyone knows: episodes that don't quite ""fit,"" implausible patterns of ""new world-ending catastrophe every week"" arising, and the sort of flailing around that writers manifest when they have had their characters do just about everything plausible, so they get punchy and say to each other, ""Hey, let's put them all in the Wild West! Hey, let's put them all on the Al Capone planet! How about the Greek Olympus planet, only the gods are space aliens?"" Even (shudder) special guest stars with their own episodes written around them (uuuuggghhhh). We've all been there. But the new style also has its sorrows, and one of those is that the story arc tends to be written rather dramatically and sweeps the episodes along. If it looks like the series is popular, the producers start telling the writers to eke it out a bit: one episode that moves the story arc along, followed by one that doesn't (side stories, backstory, character development or interactions that are already part of the larger arc, or the dreaded sudden appearance of a love interest NOT part of the arc: run, sweetheart, before the reaper strikes!)  Inevitably, the end of the grand sweeping story arc is reached. These days, that usually means the series ends gracefully, the characters are tucked away, perhaps to be continued in another series, but often not (actors change, and the fans can get very picky about who can play THAT character). The fans are sad. The producers and other associated folk are already positioned for their next gig -- or those who do not want to kill one another, anyway. The crew shakes itself out and everyone settles down to the new project. But that can leave the audience feeling abandoned, even in the case of, say, Firefly, angry (OK, Firefly was canceled by those idiots at Fox prematurely, only partway through the story arc, it was brilliantly written and brilliantly conceived and acted, and if Joss Wheedon hadn't killed off Alan Tudyk's character, I'd say following it up with Serenity was a total win -- built in, motivated - even driven - fan base). And that ""sweeping story arc"" series leaves the fans disturbed and fuels frantic bursts of ""fanfic"" in an effort to continue what has ended.

DSN, by incorporating shorter story arcs and interspersing with occasional ""well, what do we do this week?"" episodes, still has the feel of the old style series, while allowing the characters to grow and change gradually. There's an antique theatrical saying about the desirability of landing a villain role: ""The snake gets all the lines!"" and non-Federation characters Quark and Garak are allowed to provide delightful bursts of dark humor or sarcasm even while almost against their will forming friendships with the crew. They shudderingly describe the Federation personnel as being just too sanitary and cheerful. It's complex enough and funny enough that it wears well, and it provides a great example of a transitional form between the old series structure and the new.",1370390400,,3341,4.930728241563055

This goes against everything Odo's character stands for....I won't spoil the ending, but watch it and decide for yourself.

All good characters deserve a blind spot and it always seemed a stretch that every Starfleet Captain had to be a paragon of virtue. Trek often uses ""outside"" devices to make their characters create conflict (a strange virus, Borg assimilation) so I'm glad we got an episode where character deficits are front and center.

Cardassian allies) attacking and taking over Deep Space Nine. That is how the season ends, but Captain Sisko is confidant that the Federation will retake DS9:
he leaves behind his beloved baseball. That is the major theme of Season 5 but
there are other minor events. Odo shows kindness ot another changling and he gets

125031,3,0792146433,"Good episode, action wise. I have ONE major criticism of this episode from the standpoint of realism. The Jadzia 'girl power' facade wears a little thin at times because it is so aggressively over-promoted throughout the episode, and this has been a continued aspect of her character since Season 4. I think the writers should have approached the physical differences between men and women from a more realistic perspective.

I'm not making the point that a woman cannot stand up to a male opponent. What I AM saying is that men and women bring a different set of advantages and disadvantages to any fight. Women, writ large, will not win arm wrestling matches with men; they are no match for men in terms of brute strength. Anatomically, there is at least a 50% upper body strength differential in men vs. in women. That being the case, most women (with a few exceptions now and then) cannot lock sabres (or in our case, bat'leths) with a male opponent and have any hope of forcing him to the ground, not without tactically exploiting a flaw in his defense. Where women DO have the advantage is in agility. They have less body mass, so they can move around more quickly than men. I think women are better at striking weak points on the male body.

Jadzia is frequently seen locking blades with men twice her size and throwing them off their feet, or lifting them by the throat with her bare hands and throwing them. Why is her fighting style not depicted more realistically?",1331596800,3,1475,4.647509578544061

In season five each episode grinds its way forward to the war with the Dominion which will shape the rest of the show till its finale. The intensive character development continues as the cast shakes off their federation naivet and enter into a complex web of intercultural intrigue and subterfuge.

This season has many great episodes, several which are the best of the series. ""Apocalypse Rising"" is a fun into to the season and gives us Sisko, Odo, and Obrien in disguised as Klingons. ""Looking for Par'March in all the Wrong Places"" pairs Klingon and Ferengi for a comedic romp. ""Nor the Battle to the Strong"" brings Jake from boy to man. ""In Purgatory's Shadow"" & ""By Inferno's Light"" a two-parter that pushes the tensions towards the upcoming war. ""A Call to Arms"" packs a wallop and starts the war.

The two best episodes of Season Five are ""Trials and Trible-ations""  and  ""The Rapture"". ""Trials and Trible-ations"" takes the crew back in time to the Trible episode in the original Star Trek series. The episode is a testament to the dedication and hard work of the special effects and set design team. 15 years later the episode looks fabulous, it is seamlessly put together with original Star Trek footage. The DS9 cast pay their own quirky homage to the franchise's unique sense of humor in its most beloved episode of all time.

""The Rapture"" features Avery Brooks' most powerful performance thus far in the series, showcasing his profound talents as an actor. Brooks' is always on top of his game when it comes to his performance as Captain Sisko, but this episode allows him to really stretch his acting muscles and show us what he's capable of. He is an actor of immense talent. It is one of my absolute favorite episodes of the entire series.

According to the actual episode the claim is made that Captain Sisko and his crew returned to their own time line--after some intrigue, of course--and the settlement on the world they left behind ceased to exist. An alternate possible theory is that the settlement continued to exist in another timeline. I believe this alternative is more in keeping with Quantum Theory. I would be interested in hearing from others and their opinion about this. I realize--of course--that time travel is not possible for us mere mortals living in the here and now but it may very well be possible for space travelers to do this in the far future.

It works pretty well but it seems the writers were struggling to find a way to transition out of the Klingon war and into the one with the Dominion. However, once the war starts it really heats up and gets better. The season has a few really great moments, such as Jake's experience in war and ""Trials and Tribble-ations.""

From the first episode i was hooked and had to watch it i own most of the star trek deep space nine series (just need season 6,7) But from what i have seen this is one of my favorite star trek series because it has characters that relate to you not that the other series where not good i just like the space battles so deep space nine was my addiction when it came to star trek and continues to be mostly because i haven't seen all of the episodes from the series. I never consider my self a trekkie because i enjoy alot of space combat/exploration series i own all of the star wars movies and i own star trek enterprise seasons 1-3 the originals series 2,3 voy 1, tng 1,2 all the movies and of course ds9 1,2,3,4,5. But as for season 5 this was one it';s best season in the series is has recurring characters and great plot lines and story arcs (im not one for a spoiler) so if you enjoy star trek or even space battles deep space nine is the show for you. I would urge you to buy used only because the 50 something dollar price tag wasn't that great for me i payed 30 from another amazon user and the dvd was still in it's original packaging pretty awesome. Also amazon is good with tracking the package although my package it self was rough because my post office isn't known for gental handling but i was pleased none the less. So if you like space and battle then this is a show for you or if your just a trekkie buy it anyway....I think this show turned me into a trekkie because after i saw this i had to own all the series' but it takes alot of time and money. so im taking it slow, i hope you enjoy this series as much as i did....Thanks for reading",1299110400,,1801,4.104815864022663
125200,4,0792146433,"After Star Trek TOS and the later seasons of Voyager I've always enjoyed DS9 over the other series (TNG and Enterprise) and despite the unavoidable comparisons with that other great sci fi series Babylon 5 I've always thought that DS9 was different enough from JMS' excellent storyline to avoid being an outright plagiarism.
One thing that DS9 had going for it that Babylon 5 didn't was production money and so unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series, this DS9 dvd series has better special effects, a better soundtrack and overall better picture quality as well. In contrast with the Babylon 5 series where I feel it could definitely benefit from a thorough picture restoration when they finally put it on blu-ray I found this DS9 season 5 dvd set upscales very well to 1080p when I played it on my upscalable blu-ray player. The picture quality is not blu-ray reference quality but is a vast improvement over the first four seasons and although there are some soft and grainy picture frames they were few and far between. The same holds true for the sound quality which is also pretty good unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series which I also hope will undergo intense restoration for the blu-ray release. For this reason, I am happy to stay with these standard dvds of DS9 that I already have rather than to ""upgrade"" to the blu-ray versions should they become available.

Season 5 has some of the funniest episodes of the entire series and I enjoyed the Ferengi ones very much although like Season 4 there are some duds in between some very good episodes.  I liked ""The Ship"", the hilarious ""Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places"", ""The Assignment"", ""The Begotten"", ""In Purgatory's Shadow"", and unlike the previous Season, ""Call To Arms"" the season ending episode is pretty good here.  I know other fans love the tribbles episode but as a fan of TOS I feel they should have left that classic alone.  ""Let He Who Is Without Sin..."" is probably the worst ever DS9 episode.

The plastic packaging is also very attractive and robust unlike the Babylon 5 one which I actually had to superglue back together again when the disc holder came apart from the cardboard spine. Overall, this dvd set of season 5 of DS9 sports a good, clean picture and sound transfer which upscales well on blu-ray players.

Overall not as consistently good as Season 3 but the good news is that the episodes are better than those in Season 4.",1293235200,,2409,4.68321513002364

125232,3,0792146433,"To my eyes Deep Space Nine's late fourth season saw the show began to turn from dark and gritty to just plain solom and dreary. That spirit is what follows the series into it's fifth season. There are many people who believe that TNG's fifth season was among it's weakest but,despite some weaker episodes here and there that series never really had a ""weak"" season as a whole. One of main reasons during this season for all the gloom had to do with character atmospherics. The enthusiastic if occasionally mistrustful banter if these characters that added a humor to this often edgy series is replaced by this dry,resigned meloncaughly attitude when the characters are interacting collectively and such moments result in a lot of noticably low engery episodes. Also again DS9 is slowly morphing (much as Odo might *laugh*) into more and more of a war melodrama revolving around themes such as honor among soldiers and survival. Again personally it's just not my kind of Star Trek and again this doesn't take away from the strong moments in this season,most of which have a comedic bent. The most famous episode this season is ""Trials And Tribble-Ations"" in which the DS9 crew gain an opportunity to interact with their counterparts from TOS during the events of one of their classic episodes. Sisko even gets a chance to speak to the legendary James T Kirk before departing to his own time. During this season amongst all the conflict two things come out of this: the Cardassians joining with the Dominion against the Federation as well as the related subsequent inihilation of the Maquis,the rebel faction DS9 once spawned.  In this season we also have an excellent character study in ""Doctor Bashir,I Presume"" where not only do we meet Julian Bashir's parents but learn his medical brilliance is the result of illegal genetic enhancement. It's a key moment in development for the long underutilized character and effects everything that happens to him through the remainder of the series. By the end of the series it finally happens: war officially breaks out between the Dominion and the Federation and culiminates in the wonderously evil Gul Dukat and his new Dominion hench men,including the repellent butt-kissing clone Weyoun take over the station forcing the Federation crew to abandon it leaving people like Kira,Odo and...even Jake Sisko to fend for themselves under Dominion occupation.

125237,5,0792146433,"After several very good seasons, DS9 really hit its prime in season 5.  At this point each of the show's arcs had picked up enough steams they could pretty much run on themselves; earlier investment in characters, particularly recurring ones, paid off dividends.  Worf, who'd felt somewhat tacked on as a publicity plot in season 4, was merging much better into the cast and with the rest of the storyline.  As always there was a dud or two (""Ferengi Love Songs"" is the worst in this batch), but even the middle of the pack is fairly strong.  The classics are well-known: ""The Ship"", ""Rapture"", ""In Purgatory's Shadow"", ""By Inferno's Light"", ""Empok Nor"", and the classic original-series tribute ""Trials and Tribble-ations"".  The one episode I'd single out for props is ""A Call to Arms"" - perhaps the best season finale that DS9 ever had.

It's a shame that many people lose interest in DS9 during the first season and a half - because if you have made it this far, the decision really pays off.  Great science-fiction television!",1261699200,,1029,4.779661016949152
125238,5,0792146433,"There is a good reason that STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE is my favorite series in the STAR TREK franchise:  it comes closest to embracing a serial rather than an episodic format.  No STAR TREK series was completely a serial, but this came closest by far.  This was always something of a mystery to me, because clearly STAR TREK: VOYAGER should have had this distinction.  That series was completely structured to be a serial, with the show having a natural beginning (Voyager's being stranded in the Delta quadrant), a middle (the journey across the bulk of the quadrant), and an end (Voyager's return to the Alpha quadrant and therefore to home).  But by focusing on perpetually meeting new races and challenges, Voyager short circuited what could have been its most positive asset.  DS9, however, made the greatest use of any of the ST series on the political relations between the various Alpha quadrant empires, and made it all the more richer by introducing the Dominion and the Founders who arrived from the Gamma quadrant.  My one regret with DS9 was that it never became a full blown serial like FARSCAPE or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, but if it had, it would have been an absolutely spectacular show.

Another reason DS9 was stronger than TNG or VOYAGER was that it employed fewer gimmicks involving Magic Science, either using some bizarrely speculative scientific solution to a problem (a device that sometimes crippled both series, though not nearly as much as some other series, like STARGATE SG-1, on which the scientific solutions got so silly at times as to render the show a comedy -- how many times did we see alternative reality versions of the main characters?).  For the most part, DS9 departed from this, maintaining a relative realism.  The show focused very little on science, but instead on interstellar global politics and interpersonal relations.  I actually think other ST series had stronger natural casts, but the writing and format was so much stronger that it more than made up for it.

There were some nice developments in Season Five.  Kira had the O'Brien's baby.  Nog returned to serve as something of an intern while away from Star Fleet Academy (they never really explained how that was possible, but Nog was a lot of fun as an Ensign -- more fun than as a scamp -- so that is OK).  Odo once again became a changling.  The only major arc that really bugged me was Dax and Worf.  Few couples that I've ever seen on TV had less chemistry than these two, not just as lovers, but as friends.  I found it utterly impossible to buy the two of them even as buddies.  They simply did not feel right together, had little in the way of fun interplay, and weren't fun to watch.  At least I had no fun watching them.

One thing that amazed me about DS9 is how consistent it was from beginning to end.  People love to debate about which seasons of what shows are best.  People debate endlessly whether Season Two, Three, or Five of BUFFY was the best, and since those really were better than the other seasons, the debate makes some sense.  With other shows, there is very little debate.  Season Three of FARSCAPE was so good that just about no series ever made had a season that could compete.  But one could make a good case for just about any season of DS9 as the best, though in my opinion each season was a tiny bit better than the last.  But that was only because the series benefited form the accumulating storylines.  All in all, a very good show indeed.",1260576000,,3479,4.631321370309951

125281,5,0792146433,"The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 880 minutes, it is 4 episodes (1 Disc) less than TNG, and at least 2 Discs less than TOS. However in total, for the definitive, Star Trek collection, we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. They are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker cannot say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Parents respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case may be the best of the lot. The shadowy design is foreboding of a darker trek inside. The case opens to reveal the 6 discs and a collectors' DVD-ROM of a section of a model graphic of DS9 (collect all complete the computer model). The discs are held in an open (no cardboard covering) plastic flip holder like in the TOS seasons. However these collectors' boxes are being replaced by the new slim line boxes that are cheaper. These are simply a cardboard holder with four to five slim DVD case holders with 1 to 2 discs in each holder (The slim line boxes do not contain the special collectors' DVD-ROM). There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 6 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. Often the bonus disc may contain the last episode or two of the season, so watch out for those. Sometimes the episodes are ordered not in the sequence they were filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they were filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, Deep Space Nine (DS9), Season five is mostly about the coming invasion of the dominion, alliances, divisions and relationships.

The same crew is back. DS9 is commanded by Benjamin Sisko. Jake Sisko is his son. Odo is the station's metamorphosing police constable and a Bajoran operative. Doctor Bashir is the Starfleet doctor and Chief O'Brien is chief engineer. Quark is a Ferengi host who owns a casino and bar. Major Kira is Sisko's first in command, and a Bajoran. Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax is a Trill woman (and a long term friend of Sisko) assigned by Starfleet as technical advisor. Gul Dukat is a leading Cardassian. The Cardassian Garak has a permanent role since season four, as do Quarks brother Rom and his nephew Nog who are now part of Starfleet.

Season Five of DS9 is mostly about impersonations, stand offs, honour, horrors of war, wraiths, time travel, Worf and Dax, Terok Nor, cooperation, visions, revenge, changelings, traitors, Jem'Hadar prisons, holograms, mysterious women, debt, dissidents, The Grand Nagus, Klingon crews, drugs, baseball cards and the Dominion Invasion.

Best episodes are The Ascent, The Begotten, In Purgatory's Shadow (By Inferno's Light), Blaze of Glory and Call to Arms.

DS9 Season five is not quite as good as season four but a few seasons make up for it, however there are a few dodgy episodes that are real misses and almost knock it back a star. Aside from these the series has a definite mature direction almost building up to an end and the characters are fully fleshed out. Since season four introduced the Defiant at least half of the shows have a Star Trek ship besides the DS9 station. It has worked wonders to be able to trek again. Bringing Worf in from season four was also a winner. This season though is darker than four, it has less humour and is heading towards a depressing time as the Dominion slowly flood through the wormhole preparing their attack. Also DS9 is transforming into its former Terok Nor. This is a very interesting dimension and maybe more fascinating than the war itself. The CGI in this season stands out, lots of improvements, lots of space battles and lots of fighting. So it is all about the Dominions plans to conquer the Federation but it plays out slowly and has a bit of a stark ending for the federation but the final images suggest that the biggest battles have yet to come. So with season six we are expecting the real war. Bring on the revenge of the federation.",1228435200,,5131,4.62788144895719

125283,3,0792146433,"If you know your Bible history, then you may be famailar with the Tower of Babel and how all who worked on the project were suddenly strucken with the inability to communicate and understand one another - thus the project was never completed as seen fit by God (I think I got it correct).  Anyways, it's not quite like that in this episode of DS9 titled ""Babel"", but a similar experience occurs where crewmembers begin suffering from a virus that keeps them from communicating among one another.

As crewmemebrs begin to suffer one by one, you are left wondering who exactly is going to save the day and get the antidote.  On top of it, some lunatic alien tries to flee the station in fear while the locking clamps are still attached to his ship.  In addition to the virus, there is also the soon to be threat of a large explosion unless someone releases his ship manually.  So, there is some excitement, but not much for the most part.  Most of the episode is spent trying to figure out where the virus originated and then where an antidote can be found.  It was kind of boring throughout, and there wasn't really any secondary story like many DS9 episodes have.

Possibly the best thing about this episode is that the Quark character finally begins to take shape.  His seriousness from Emissary is now being replaced with humor and a louder, whinier voice.  His makeup has also begin to change into a more comfortable, smooth look.  My favorite scene is near the end when Odo is on the transporter pad and he is seriously asking Quark if he even knows how to operate a transporter system, and Quark interrupts him quickly, laughing ""Energizing!""

Bable is just not a memorable episode for the most part, and one of the many reason season one was probably the most boring of all the DS9 seasons.  Hand it to Quark to save the episode from complete misery.

As such, I've been able to see so much more than having to have waited for a year to enjoy them all.  This show has had so many little things that added up from previous seasons.  The characters have grown and changed, the cast has grown with it.  The stories have gotten better, and more interesting.  All of which led to the last episode...the begining of the dominion war.  I was thrilled.  Sisko has come into his own as captain.  All the characters are now more and more interesting.  The supporting characters are great, and frankly this show is one of the best science fiction shows around.  I regret treating this show like the middle child it seemed to be.  Left after the next generation, but not allowed to become the flagship show  (that was left to voyager), constantly having to fight off other sci-fi competitors (babylon 5), this show was always given the raw end of the stick.  But the show didn't seem to care.  Every season has improved, and rather than copy what others had done, this show stayed the course it always intended.  Having watched this show from the begining, you can tell the intent for the dominion war from as soon as season 2.  This show could have played off old star trek cliche's, but instead chose to be its own, for better or worse.  Try this show.

Memories of Season Four

The fourth season left me empty for the most part. The return of Worf was a little lackluster as his character is stiff and old school like so many of the characters in the Original Series and Next Generation. It also lead to a season of endless Klingon drama.  Another disappointment of Season 4 was the growing influx of attempted comic relief that relied on oftentimes overused cliches and a sense of ""when in doubt, try humor"".  I think Dax, Quark and even Sisko at times had lines that were supposed to be funny, but left the viewer with that ""moving right along"" feeling. In addition, a few of the final episodes were almost pointless in character development and DS9 plot development.  For instance, while Hard Time was an interesting concept, the whole episode served no real purpose other than being mildly entertaining.  O' Brien is a well developed character and dedicating an entire episode to further display his nature was almost pointless.  The plot had no connections to the ongoing events of DS9 and the way the interactions with an unfamiliar race were handled was not typical Starfleet. The very idea they allowed O'Brien to be mentally tortured with only a minor dismissal as to why was strange in the least.  I don't know if it was a change in usual writers or just an attempt to give the series a shot to improve ratings, I think Season Four did little to connect to the overall DS9 passion after Season 3 reeled you in.

Season Five started strong and momentarily reverted to attempts at light-heartedness or direct humor.  Episodes like ""The Ship"", ""Looking for par' Mach In All the Wrong Places"", ""Let He Who Is Without Sin"" and much of the general hoopla of the first two discs was a bit drab. Apocalypse Rising and Trials and Tribble-lations were consilations.

The true DS9 substance returned with Disc 3 as the writing seemed to return to excellence and the focus built around the growing conflict with the Dominion and the allegiances formed during war. Absolutely brilliant writing!

To recount my favorite episodes would require nothing short of a novel.  For instance, Apocalypse Rising connected the Klingon drama to the Dominion, subtlely explored Odo's internal conflict (later addressed throughout various episodes)with being a changling and left me laughing at the very idea of Odo and O'Brien being Klingons (subtle humor is wonderful). Trials and Tribble-lations which was a breathtaking exhibit of the beauty of modern technology in marrying the past and the present, the whimsical play at the transformation Klingons incurred overtime leaving the viewer to wonder at the evolution, AND the return of Kirk, Spock and those ever-annoying tribbles. The Ascent was a guilty pleasure of mine as I typically don't like episodes that drift completely from the core storyline, but the relationships between certain DS9 characters are brilliant (Miles and Julian, Garak and Julian, Kira and Odo, Kira and Dukat, Quark and Rom and here Odo and Quark). Rapture was great as Sisko is finally forced to embrace his role as Emissary and the religious overflow is impressive. The Eddington Episodes (For the Uniform and Blaze of Glory) were among my favorites as they explored the Maquis' place in the quadrant, focused on the fine line between doing what is right and fighting for a lost cause and just awesome acting all around. In Purgatory's Shadow and By Inferno's Light are among the best for revealing the Dominion storyline and further characterizing the Jem'Hadar. Dr. Bashir I Presume was hilarious as the secret of Julian's genetic enhancements proved comical. The very idea of one ego strong character (Dr. Zimmerman) outting another (Dr. Bashir)!  Too bad the revelation resulted in nothing more substantial to the series.  A Call to Arms is probably my favorite of all DS9 episodes thus far and a fabulous season finale.

For me there was great irony with Sisko leaving Dukat the baseball. It drove me mad watching Sisko endlessly playing with the ball during the 5th season. Before the final episode (A Call to Arms), I had come to the conclusion that the ball represented frustration for Sisko.  It was his way of releaving stress or pondering over what to do as war was inevitable.  For him to leave the ball with Dukat was wonderful because it clearly meant ""I'll be back for sure"" as that autographed baseball was a huge part of ""The Sisko"".

I can't wait to see Season 6.  I was in Germany during the last few seasons and didn't see every episode, so this will be a great treat once Seasons 6 and 7 go on sale!

125331,4,0792146433,"This season has moments of brilliance.  It is also slow in a few episodes. The Klingon storyline gets a little thin. The Tribble episode is worth the price of entire season. It is done with such skill that the time travel sequence seems real for a moment. It is a loving tribute that I will remember for awhile!

I am really liking the characters now. The early seasons did an effective job setting them up. It seems this crew is destined to be my favorite. The aliens are once more likeable and believable.  The Dominion War looms on the horizon. By the season finale, The station begins to seem vulnerable. Indeed, the Federation itself is being taken where it has never been before-under seige!

I am sure there will be a happy ending. War is never good, but it makes an excellent storyline within the Star Trek universe. This is the first time this has happened on such a scale. I eagerly anticipate next season!",1147046400,,916,4.533333333333333
125332,5,0792146433,"Nominated for 28 Emmys, including several for Outstanding Visual Effects, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), the first Star Trek series spin-off of the original, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine foreshadowed additional spin-offs - Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). Sporting an entirely new cast and crew from its two predecessors, the show focuses on a particular system administered by the Federation instead of the usual Star Trek mission of ""exploring strange new worlds""...

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine follows the exploits of the Starfleet crew aboard an abandoned and gutted Cardassian space station orbiting the planet of Bajor. In the aftermath of Cardassian occupation, the Bajorian government invited the Starfleet to oversee the reconstruction of the space station. Deep Space Nine quickly transformed into a teeming city of commerce and a hub for travel (similar to Babylon 5) thanks to the discovery of an unknown wormhole nearby. But the wormhole leads to the Gamma Quadrant, realm of the feared Dominion alliance, which views the wormhole travelers as a threat to its totalitarian grip on power. As such, the Dominion launches an attack against the Federation and its Klingon allies. The subsequent and ongoing war is the basis for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

Capt. Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) is credited with discovering the wormhole, and he oversees the crew of Deep Space Nine as they wage battle to preserve the Federation. Ironically, his colleague, Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois), is a Changeling - an alien race of ""shapeshifters"" who lead the Dominion's united front. Together with the rest of the crew aboard Deep Space Nine, they struggle with internal and external conflicts that threaten to destroy their very way of life...

The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 5) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Apocalypse Rising"" in which the crew suspects Gowron is a mole, having been infiltrated by a Changeling. Ben, Miles, and Odo disguise themselves as Klingons and discover that General Martok is the real traitor among them... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include ""Rapture"" in which Sisko dreams of seeing Bajor's future and the vision warns him in regard to the planet joining the Federation, and ""Soldiers of the Empire"" in which Worf and Dax accompany General Martok following his release from a Dominion prison camp, but the rendezvous turns out to be more than they bargained for when their ship comes under attack...

125335,4,0792146433,"Usually I don't enjoy those episodes of the later Star Trek incarnations that draw on past shows from the original series.  But this is one of those rare exceptions where I don't adhere too strongly to that belief.  Reuniting the familiar Kor, Koloth & Kang was a minor stroke of genius by the creative staff and the storyline is first-rate but not executed without flaws.  Some great humor, a heinous and hateful villain plus the dilemma Dax experiences because of her current standing as a Starfleet officer and her recent past as Curzon Dax makes this one of the better DS9 episodes.

Discovering the Klingon that Odo has incarcerated is an old friend named Kor, Dax asks to have him released into her custody.  Soon the two of them meet up with another pair of Klingons, Koloth and Kang, on the DS9 promenade.  The three Klingons have gathered together at the station looking for Curzon Dax so the four of them could carry out a blood oath against a nemesis, the Albino, who killed the three Klingons first-born as an act of vengeance.  Kang has received information from a traitor concerning the whereabouts of their common enemy and is eager to exact revenge.  Both Kang and Koloth refuse to let Jadzia Dax participate because she is both no longer Curzon Dax and a man.  She proves herself to them in a bat'leth battle on the holosuite and soon they depart DS9 for the Albino's fortress on a nearby planet.  Dax realizes that something is wrong with their mission and confronts Kang who confesses he has been in contact with the Albino who wants to meet his enemies in battle and a chance for each of them to die with honor.  Because the Albino has too favorable an edge Dax figures a strategy to even the odds, disabling the weaponry at the fortress and allowing the four of them to do hand-to-hand combat with their enemy and his forces.  The fight soon ensues and ends with both victory and tragedy for the quartet.

A favorite among fans since it was first seen the credit for the reunion of Classic Trek Klingons goes to series co-producer Robert Hewitt Wolfe.  According to the book 'The DS9 Companion' upon reading writer Peter Allan Fields's story Wolfe suggested to the writer that he use the three Klingons from the original series.  It was a real coup for the show and fans alike that the same three actors were still available and able to recreate their old characters.  Although each of them give fine performances John Calicos as Kor is the most enjoyable and received all the humorous lines of dialogue.  It's a shame he didn't make a return to the station in a later episode.  But as significant as the gathering of these three is the episode still clearly remains focused on the character of Dax.

Dax experiences another identity crisis and she is set on participating in the blood oath because her principals allow her to see such a violent act as honorable and means that justice will be exacted under Klingon laws.  Sisko reminds her that she is a Starfleet officer, ""What about the laws of the Federation, are you just going to ignore them?""  When he pushes her further by asking if she'll be ready to suffer the consequences of her actions under Federation law she leaves the station telling Sisko she'll find out if he bring the charges against her.  It is an effective moment but all the same quite a silly one.  Any commanding officer would have placed a subordinate officer under arrest and been done with it.  And when she does return all he does is stare her down.  Only in the movies!  Another small quibble I had with this episode was the absence of the Klingon death howl.  In the ST: TNG episode 'Heart Of Glory' the Klingon death ritual was shown as holding the deceased one's eyes open while the living looked upward and howled, in essence warning the dead that a warrior is about to enter their realm.  Instead one of the Klingons sings.  Maybe there has to be more than one Klingon present for this ritual?  And since when do tetryon particles cause phasers and weaponry to malfunction?  This is the one and only reference to this tactic in the entire Star Trek canon which is amazing since it is so effective when used here!

On the other hand there are other more quietly effective and less unerring moments such as Dax coldly asking Kira about how it felt to her to kill Cardassians during the war.  The bat'leth fight between Kang and Dax on the holosuite is done very well.  The final fight sequence at the Albino's fortress has both a great gothic and operatic feel to it; and Dax has a great closing line as her friends lay slain.  But the best line of the show comes in the opening when Quark gets Odo's help in disposing of an unruly Klingon holosuite customer.  It seems the individual refuses to leave and has threatened to kill him if he turns the power off.  At the entrance Odo tells Quark to turn the power off to which the Ferengi exclaims, ""I can't or the Klingon will kill us"".  Odo quickly and correctly points out, ""No.  He said he'd kill you.""  Yet another great and memorable exchange between the two 'friendly' adversaries of DS9.

Worth noting:  Michael Ansara who plays Kang here would return for the fourth season episode 'The Muse' as the alien Jeyal.",1102118400,,5222,4.576964477933261
125336,5,0792146433,"Star Trek is an exceptional television series in that over the many years it has been broadcast it has managed to bring to wider public attention some of the strangest philosophical and ethical questions imaginable.  Writers had been doing this for years in science fiction novels and short stories but received very little attention for their efforts.  Only a handful of such publications garnered an audience of mass appeal, mainly among college students and becoming referred to as 'underground' classics, i.e. Robert A. Heinlein's 'Stranger In A Strange Land' and similar related titles that are commonly mentioned in the same breath.  The episodes of the classic original series would visit some of those themes in books previously published but it was the follow-up series' that would do justice to these ideals that had been a part of a burgeoning sub-culture that was finally reaching its zenith.  Utilizing plot devices and themes seen in the previous TNG episodes like 'Future Imperfect', 'Elementary, Dear Data' and it's follow-up 'Ship In A Bottle', DS9's second season show 'Shadowplay' becomes one of those multiple episodes that demonstrate this.

While returning from an exploratory mission in the Gamma Quadrant Odo and Dax pause to investigate the mysterious presence of omicron particles.  Tracing it's origins to a nearby planet surface they discover a village; when they beam down to take a closer look they are immediately placed under arrest by the village 'Protector' Colyus.  He informs them that 22 villagers have disappeared without a trace, the most recent one six hours prior to their appearance in the village.  Odo and Dax are cleared as suspects and they offer Colyus their assistance; it isn't long before they discover the source of the conundrum...but that opens up another perplexing problem to sort out as well.

I don't want to spoil the ending for those who haven't yet seen this show so I won't give away too much. While the story itself isn't much of a mystery it's the question asked in the last act that's more confounding: What is reality?  And how it is answered is what the makes the episode a memorable one.  Wisely, the writers choose to have Odo make the argument and plead the case of the villagers; his character is one in transition, in a constant state of flux: Who am I? Are there any others like myself? What is my real purpose?  And in using him the writers added a genuinely humane touch.  Odo develops a close friendship with one of the children of the village which is what makes him so passionately debate them back into existence.  He also offers a rare parting gift to the child prior to leaving the village.  His character grows just a little softer around his hardened edges here.

There are two other subplots within this show as well - a rarity in Star Trek episodes.  One of them involves Kira visiting Quark after hours in his bar informing him she's keeping an eye on him in Odo's absence.  Another has Jake suffering from an inner conflict: how to tell his father he doesn't want to go to the academy.  Both subplots utilize a storytelling device that juxtaposes what is perceived to be an obvious truth with what the truth actually is.  Hence the title of the episode.  Neither of these is as dramatically interesting as the main storyline but each of them has a worthy moment or two and the final revelation in Kira's suspicions about Quark leads to a great parting line from him.

Some final notes: The show's original title was 'Persistence Of Vision' before it was changed in favor of the current one; if that title sounds familiar it should - it was recycled for use as the title of a second season 'Voyager' episode.  Ken Tobey, who plays the pivotal role of 'Rurigan', is better known to film buffs as the veteran actor/star of the 50's classic sci-fi movies ""The Thing (From Another World)"" and ""It Came From Beneath The Sea"".  Kenneth Mars, who plays 'Colyus', is also a recognizable character actor of many feature films, most famously his comic turn in Mel Brooks's cult comedy classic ""The Producers"".  The young girl who plays the villager 'Taya' can also be seen in the fifth season TNG episode ""Imaginary Friend"" as the character 'Clara Sutter'.",1093305600,,4231,4.826869806094183
125337,5,0792146433,"Whew! I just finished viewing seasons 1 - 7 of DS9 and now I know why so many people consider it the best Star Trek in terms of story and character development. DS9 went with a big bang in season 7 because of the Dominion War 10 episode arc. The last episode, ""What you leave behind"" was fast-paced and beautifully written , an appropiate climax for a show that never let me down. When it was over I felt so sad because of the realistic devastation of the war and because both Odo and Sisko were apparently gone for good. The DVD set is well produced and I recomend you find the Section 31 features in this set for they include some Crew Dossiers devoted to a few of the most important supporting characters. Also I really enjoyed ""The Last Goodbyes"" a short doc about the last days of the crew and cast together.

125339,4,0792146433,"The fifth season of Deep Space Nine is a strong entry in the Star Trek line-up.  The influence of Babylon 5 was growing, with even more elaborate on-going storylines cropping up.  This may have made things confusing when the series originally aired (if you happened to not be home during an important episode, you'd come back the next week to a different galactic power-balance), but since the show is now out on DVD, there's no real danger of missing something and getting lost.
The previous season had seen the introduction of Worf, and his entry onto the station opened up a large potential for Klingon stories.  Season four had devoted a fair amount of time to tales of the Klingon Empire.  That trend continued through to the fifth year culminating in ""Soldiers of the Empire"" which takes place almost entirely on board a Klingon Bird Of Prey with Dax as the only character not buried underneath heavy prosthetics.  To my surprise, I really enjoyed this gradual inclination towards more episodes dealing with loud actors shouting at each other about honor.  I had been fairly bored during The Next Generation's attempts at building up the Klingons, so I was very happy that the Deep Space Nine people managed to not only hold my interest, but kept me wanting to see more.
My enthusiasm for this season is caught between a desire to talk about the various ongoing plot stands and the need to highlight the great standalone episodes.  Deep Space Nine did an almost perfect job of balancing the two, making my job even more difficult.  The Star Trek universe underwent many changes during this year with all sorts of allegiances forming and/or falling apart.  On a more personal level, a few characters had to face demons from their past, but those stories were generally better than one might expect (in Star Trek, ""demons from the past"" usually involve someone's parent showing up unexpectedly and a Large Argument From Childhood finally being cleared up -- thankfully the show mostly steered away from this).  Sisko's role as Emissary of Bajor was given more than just a cursory examination, while Quark and Odo continued to develop their snide arguments.
The extras in this release revolve around the fifth season (surprise, surprise).  This means that there's not one but two mini-documentaries focused on the ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" episode (where Sisko and company go back in time and interact with the original 60s Star Trek episode, ""The Trouble With Tribbles"").  And, to be fair, there's a lot of stuff from and about that episode worthy of discussion.  The first documentary involves a lot of talking heads discussing how the premise developed and what kinds of difficulties the production crew encountered getting it to the screen.  The second documentary (and the one I found the most interesting, geek that I am) is more about the technical side of the episode -- how they managed to actually get the modern day actors and actresses to appear as if they were standing alongside their TOS counterparts.  The ""Forrest Gump"" technology is expounded upon at length as well as the troubles that the model designers had in recreating the old ships and starbase models.
We also have a mini-documentary featuring the character of Miles O'Brien, one of the series' more entertaining and realistic characters.  Also, Mike Okuda gives a guided tour of the space-station sets, pointing out little in-jokes that were too small to be seen on-camera.  Michael Westmore (as he has in previous seasons) takes a look back at the various alien baddies and their makeup.
There were a few clunkers this year (""Let He Who Is Without Sin"" - argh!  Run away!  Run away!), but overall I found this to be an excellent season of television.  The storyline continually gets beefed up until one can't figure out exactly how they are going to keep outdoing themselves.  The season ender is a great bit of storytelling and gives one a great sense of anticipation for the following year.",1079222400,11,3975,4.902985074626866

125402,4,0792146433,"The Klingon conflict continues as season five begins. But after spending a fourth year doing that, the writers and producers began to return to the Dominion story line. While some saw this tonal shift proof the series was in trouble, for the writers and producers, it was what they needed to bring the Dominion arc back to center stage.
""Apocalypse Rising"" brought about an end to the Klingon ""problem"" and opened the door for the return of the Changelings.
Season five also had other things going for it. Star Trek was celebrating its 30 anniversary that year, and both DS9 and Voyager were going to do special episodes to commemorate that fact. Voyager brought back George Takei and Grace Lee Whitney as Sulu and Rand in a so-so tale adventure that brought Janeway to the bridge of the Excelsior during the events of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. DS9 would go the distance and bring everyone back from TOS. Of sorts, anyway. Thanks to the breakthrough technology used in the Oscar winning film Forest Gump, the crew of DS9 travels back into the events of TOS episode ""The Trouble with Tribbles."" In the humorous and slightly goofy ""Trials and Tribble-ations"", Sisko and his crew have to stop a plot to kill Kirk before all of time is destroyed. The writers worked a miracle, by placing the crew into a 30 year-old episode.
The 100th episode, ""The Ship"" also aired, along with ""Looking for Par'Mach in all the Wrong Places"", ""Nor Battle to the Strong"" (a special episode for Cirroc Lofton, a birthday present for the actor from the producers, as he was now 18 and no longer had to have a teacher on the set), ""Things Past"", ""The Ascent"", ""Rapture"", ""The Darkness and the Light"", ""The Begotten"" (where Odo gets his shapeshifting abilities returned),""For the Uniform"", the two-part ""In Purgatory's Shadow/By Inferno's Light"", ""Doctor Bashir, I Persume?""(which featured a performance from Voyager's Robert Picardo as the real Dr. Zimmerman), Business as Usual"", ""Ties of Blood and Water"" (a sequel of sorts to season three's ""Second Skin""), ""Ferengi Love Songs"", the brilliant ""Children of Time"", the darkly humorous ""In the Cards"" and the shattering finale ""A Call to Arms"".
As I've mentioned before, there are always stinkers (the less said about ""A Simple Investigation"" the better), but overall, the series was in its stride. The fifth season would also see a magnificent visual effect of all of Starfleet heading towards DS9 -now overtaken by the Dominion and the Cardassians. It was an awe inspiring, jaw dropping effect.
And as the ships head towards DS9, Gul Dukat -now back in his office -discovers a message that Sisko left him.
A baseball.
 Dukat, as he holds the ball, tells a puzzled Weyoun that Sisko intends to return.

125406,5,0792146433,"War isn't hell after all but it is profitable. We've seen that with in the real world and the producers/writers of Deep Space Nine found it to be true in fiction as well. With season five Deep Space Nine hit its stride. No longer dependent on The Next Generation, the series had begun to carve out its own niche during seasons three and four. The introduction of Next Gen character Worf and the conflict with the Klingon Empire during season four had distracted producer Steven Ira Behr from venturing further into the trenches of the war between the Federation and The Dominion. Now with season five they were back on course. Behr had also introduced new blood in both the writing and directing department that had not been affiliated with Trek before. This again allowed the show to achieve its own distinctive dramatic presence. DS9 also boasted the strongest writing staff of any show of the Star Trek franchise. The characters didn't always get along (a minor flaw of The Next Gen) and the show frequently examined the ethical boundaries of war (something that didn't trouble Captain Kirk too much despite his allegiance to the Prime Directive).
The story arcs during season five focused on much more on action than before. Behr  also broke out a Trek stable that had been missing during many of the early season stand-alone episodes-humor.  Apocalypse Rising , Trials and Tribble-ations, Things Past, For The Uniform and Rapture were all highlights for season five. Trials and Tribble-ations integrated a classic old episode of Star Trek into a new DS9 one. Sisko and his crew must go back in time to prevent the murder of James Kirk. Set in the whimsical Trouble with Tribbles episode from 1967, the big challenge was integrating the crewmembers from the current series into shots from an episode shot nearly 30 years ago. What's surprising is that both episode and the effects work are seamlessly interwoven into the Tribbles episode.
Another strong episode is the time travel story Children of Time. While on a mission investigating a strange energy field, the Defiant is struck by a tendril from the field. Every one survives the encounter but there's been a change; the Crew is hailed by someone on the uninhabited planet. An unidentified man and woman call the crewmembers by name and invite them to visit the planet. Once on the planet's surface the two people identify themselves as descendants of the crew. Evidently the ship has been thrown into the future and when they try and leave orbit in two days time they'll be flung into the past again, crash land and be unable to escape or get off a distress signal.
What's most interesting about the episode is the examination of the concept of fate. If Sisko and his crew do attempt to get home and try and circumvent the accident, they'll cause an entire population of people to cease to exist. If they elect to let fate deal them a hand, they'll never see their loved ones at Deep Space Nine again. It's an interesting episode and the climax is all the more stunning for the revelations we discover.
For the Uniform brought back guest star Kenneth Marshall as Michael Eddington a Star Fleet officer who had betrayed Commander Sisko during the previous season. Sisko had vowed to hunt Eddington down and make him face a court martial. Eddington was working for the Marque a group of colonist living in an area given back to the Federation's former enemy. All the colonist were ordered to leave the planets turned over to the Cardassians an alien species that have become new allies of the Federation. The colonist refused christened themselves the Maque and proceeded to fight both sides. It's a tense episode that deals with a number of intriguing ethical issues.
With the last episode of season 5 the production crew pulled out many of the stops. Call to Arms watches the Federation lose the battle but not the war against the shape shifter led Dominion. Sisko and his crew must retreat from Deep Space Nine and give up the space station. It's a bittersweet moment during the series run given all the obstacles that the characters faced when they first took over the space station on DS9.
 The image is quite good although there is some noticeable edge enhancement in some episodes as well as other digital compression artifacts. The picture is surprisingly clear and sharp.  Still, compared to The Next Generation boxed sets, DS9 is a considerable improvement.. The 5.1 Dolby Digital mix is used very well. Expanding both the scope and depth of the original sound.
There's a number of feaurettes worth watching. There's two on the creation of the episode Trials and Tribble-ations that are quite interesting.  The first looks at the origin of the episode and the second focuses on the unusual technical challenges of joining two episodes separated by 30 years.
There's also the usual featurette on the aliens created for season five. Also, there's a special featurette that tours the main set of Deep Space Nine and looks at inside jokes. The Section 31 Hidden Files are fairly easy to find and access and do provide interesting background on the characters.
This is a good boxed set with some minor compression flaws and well worth picking up. The original series was always darker looking than Next Generation and, as such, is a bit of a challenge for DVD. The limitations of the format mean there are quite a few compression artifacts but, again, these were unavoidable given the amount of information encoded on each disc.  For neophytes I'd recommend picking up season 3 and 4 prior to this boxed set to have a better understanding the series as a whole.",1067126400,5,5625,4.811789038262668

125408,5,0792146433,"Season five is one of those seasons that fans like myself have been waiting years for in a format such as DVD!  There is only one way to describe this season, incredible!  From the writing to the acting and the entire ""theme"" of the season, this fifth season is just simply amazing.  Prior to this season of DS9, no Star Trek series had ever truly tackled an ongoing plot device such as the ramping up of the war with the Dominion and they simply did it with perfection.
From the overall design of the Dominion with the Founders, Vorta and Jem'Hadar and the whole structure of the Dominion, they created the perfectly intractable and unknown enemy.  In effect they were the perfect adversaries to foil the Federation and in doing so, the Dominion brought about a large amount of the best writing in the Star Trek universe to date!  The only disappointment of the season was the absence of a Mirror universe episode.
A brief synopsis of the more outstanding episode of this season:  (Unfortunately, there's a 1K word limit because every episode of this season deserves a highlight)
Apocalypse Rising - In this outstanding season opener; following Odo's surprising news that Gowron, the Chancellor of the Klingon Empire is a changeling at the end of season four, Starfleet orders Sisko and crew to infiltrate the Empire and expose the changeling.
Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places - In this wonderful episode, Grilka makes a surprise visit to DS9 to see Quark and love is in the air as Worf and Dax help him pursue her and Kira and O'Brien are getting a little too close.  The ending between Worf and Dax makes this show somewhat of a poignant classic considering what happens to Dax in the next season.
Trials and Tribble-ations - As part of the thirtieth anniversary of Star Trek, DS9 came up with this exceptional episode in which the crew of the Defiant goes to Cardassia Prime and recovers the Orb of Time and is suddenly thrust into the past.  As the sensors clean up, they find themselves staring at the original Enterprise.  This is one of the best episodes of the entire seven year run.
Things Past - In this extraordinary episode Sisko, Garak, Odo and Dax end up on Terok Nor before the Cardassian withdrawal.  This episode in particular gives great insight to what a wonderful character Odo is.
The Ascent - There could be no finer episode that deals with the relationship between Quark and Odo than this one as they find themselves stranded on a planet and that they must climb a mountain to get an SOS out.
Rapture - It's superior episodes like this that made DS9 the extraordinary series that it was.  Kasidy makes her return and Sisko is having visions which lead to the prophesied discovery of an ancient Bajoran city which had been lost to them for thousands of years.
The Begotten - This episode is beautiful in every way as the writers came up with an inventive way to bring Odo back his shape shifting abilities.
For the Uniform - In this extremely intense episode Sisko begins his hunt for the traitorous Michael Eddington who betrayed Sisko and Starfleet for the Maquis.
In Purgatory's Shadow & By Inferno's Light - These are two of DS9's finest episodes as Garak receives a message from Enabran Tain and he and Worf head off into the Gamma Quadrant to find him.  They soon find themselves interred in a Jem'Hadar prison camp.  These episodes mark the beginning of Martok's recurring role.
Doctor Bashir, I Presume? - Robert Picardo from Voyager makes a guest appearance as his alter ego Dr. Zimmerman in order to create the latest EMH using Dr. Bashir as the template.  In a strange maneuver, the writers reveal that Bashir was genetically enhanced as a child.
Business as Usual - This is an outstanding Ferengi episode as Quark, financially crippled by losing his business license, begins a partnership with his cousin Gaila who is an arms dealer.
Ties of Blood and Water - This is a very poignant episode as we see Kira, who had fought Cardassians all her life, care for Tekeny Ghemor who we saw in a previous season and who had been fooled into thinking she was his daughter.
Ferengi Love Songs - This is the perfect Ferengi episode as we see Quark return to Ferenginar to visit with his Moogie and he finds that she and Grand Nagus Zek are ""together.""
Soldiers of the Empire - This is a perfect Klingon episode where Martok and Worf command a Klingon Bird of Prey in search of a lost battle cruiser feared to have been destroyed by the Jem'Hadar.
Empok Nor - This intriguing episode provides a great deal of insight into Garak's character!
Call to Arms - This episode represents one of the best season closing episodes in Star Trek!  The Dominion and the Cardassians are finally coming to take over DS9.  Sisko and crew must find a way to mine the entrance to the wormhole, evacuate the Bajorans and prepare for the defense of DS9.  The close of this episode is extraordinary, when the Defiant falls in formation with a massive Starfleet and Klingon fleet, letting the viewers know that the war that has been building up is finally here!

125409,5,0792146433,"Without repeating the reviews of each episode that is included in the box set...I have to say the Tribbles episode was a landmark of the season. It features the original series Kirk and Spock interacting with Sisko and has lots of surprises.  It's one of those time travel episodes. It involves an enemy Klingon double agent who is posing as a human in a plot to kill Captain Kirk.  Only this one is from the present starfleet era of DS9.
The extras are more of the same with interviews from John Eves, illustrator of Deep Space Nine.  I only wish that we could see more of the designs that didn't make it to TV.  Armin Shimmerman provides a few insights of the Ferenginar homeworld.",1065744000,2,683,4.483870967741935
125410,5,0792146433,"Truly a risky season for all involved, Deep Space Nine's fifth year had the show churning out some of its best hours of television and taking the show back onto its original course. Following the gloominess of season 4, Deep Space Nine featured not only more comic relief, but less of the heavy-handed devastating drama that so frequently reared its head in its predecessor. As a result, this season is much more balanced and also happens to give layers of complexity to new and previous characters. All in all, this season was the great beginning of a fantastic end.
That said, this season is close, but not nearly, the show's best. Deep Space Nine was refined in this year, but it wouldn't be until the following year that the show hit its creative and emotional peak. Another problem with this season is the occasional appearance of story flotsam (Let He Who is Without Sin, Ferengi Love Songs) that either just shouldn't have been made (the former) or were poorly executed (the latter). However, aside from some minor faults, the season does mostly contain some thrilling, fascinating, and emotional episodes that brought the series forward.
It seemed like every major (and most minor) characters had at least one episode to shine here. Captain Sisko got to finally begin to mature in his role as Emissary by receiving visions from the Prophets (Rapture) and truly feel the futility of war (The Ship), as did Jake (...Nor the Battle to the Strong), who also got to undergo machinations to get a treasured Willie Mays card (In the Cards). Kira was pregnant for most of the season, which prompted inside jokes (Apocalypse Rising) and was a central plot device when her friends began dying off (The Darkness and the Light). She also got another episode with her Cardassian father-who's-not-her-father, Legate Ghemor (Ties with Blood and Water), which exposed some of her shortcomings and resulted in some really nice scenes. Worf got to prove his mettle to the Jem'Hadar (By Inferno's Light) and become a Fletcher Christian to save his crew (Soldiers of the Empire). But of course the season was notable for putting him together with Dax (Looking for Par'mach...). Odo found a brother (The Begotten) and had a relationship with a humanoid woman (A Simple Investigation), but ultimately confessed to Kira that he loved her (Children of Time). Quark got into the arms business (Business as Usual) and developed a conscience as a result. He also ended up courting Grilka once again (Looking for Par'mach...). O'Brien was tormented again, this time by a Pah-Wraith (The Assignment), and got to revert to his old soldier roots (Empok Nor). We began to see some characters more and more, such as Jeffrey Combs' delightful Weyoun (Ties of Blood..., In the Cards, Call to Arms), Glinn Damar (Apocalypse Rising, Ties of Blood..., Call to Arms), Kai Winn (Rapture, Ties of Blood...,In the Cards). Others dropped in sporadically, such as Kassidy (Rapture) and Michael Eddington (For the Uniform, Blaze of Glory).
Along with all of this character development, we got some truly fantastic stories. ""Apocalypse Rising"" is yet another great season opener, combining suspense, political machinations and some wry humor. ""The Ship"" has got suspense, but also some moving dialogue at the end, dealing with meaninglessly lost lives. ""Looking for Par'mach..."" is a very funny episode, a Cyrano de Bergerac parallel that culminates in Quark dueling another Klingon with Bat'leths! ""The Assignment"" finally introduces the Pah-Wraiths, setting up the series finale. But, of course, the stunner of the season is ""Trials and Tribble-ations."" Technically stunning and filled with nostalgia, this episode is a winner. ""Things Past"" was a dark examination of Odo's psyche, and ""The Ascent"" allowed Quark and Odo to confess to some friendship, ""For the Uniform"" was a fantastic episode that brought the struggle between Sisko and the Eddington-led Maquis to a point. The Dominion two-parter (In Purgatory's Shadow, By Inferno's Light) brought forth most of the story threads that would propel the series into its final years. ""Doctor Bashir, I Presume"" is a dramedy looking at Bashir's sordid past. It also features Robert Picardo as a guest star, a.k.a. the EMH. ""Children of Time"" is an interesting science-fiction episode dealing with time-travel and the crew meeting their future descendants. ""Empok Nor"" captures the feel of a great slasher movie, and Garak is a very convincing psychotic killer. Credit actor Andy Robinson (Scorpio from Dirty Harry) who had problems about playing the same type of character that got him typecast. The season concludes with the stirring ""Call to Arms"", the show's best cliffhanger. All in all, the episodic offerings here are great.
In short, one needs only think of the difference that this season made in the run of the series to realize how important it was. This season features great contributions from plenty of people, and it is a must for fans.",1065312000,25,4963,5.0758873929008566
125441,5,0792146433,"The fith season of ""Star Trek Deep Space 9"" is now on DVD and paramount has wisely decided not to change the successful formula they have established and followed with the release of the first season of The Next Generation last year.
Season 5 continues the ongoing story of the Dominion threat upon the Federation and the Alpha Quadrant and centers around a military buildup by the Dominion in the Cardassian system. The Cardassiasns have joined the Dominion forcing the Federation to the brink of war. The strong and versatile cast is given alot to work with this year including Odo (Rene Auberjonois )having to deal with the loss of his shape shifting abilities and Quark (Armin Shimmerman) having to deal with the loss of his Ferengi business license that makes earning profit very difficult for the greedy bartender.
Episodes of note include ""Trials and Tribbleations"" that sends the crew to the time of the original Trek series as they interact with Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the characters from the classic ""Trouble with Tribbles"" episode. The very provoking ""A Simple Transaction"" that takes a look at the subject of weapons sales and the rousing finale ""A Call To Arms"" highlight this spectacular set. The overall quality of the episodes shine, as the acting, writing, and effects give a blance to the season. .The Season Five DVD set is a well-crafted set that in many ways surpasses the outstanding Next Generation series. Aside from the plethora of behind the scenes and making of segments, the series features the episodes in sparking color and sound and is a must for collectors.

125442,5,0792146433,"The fifth season took on new twists, with the new threat from the Founders. Revelations about characters, and their lives. And, one of the most incredible episodes for die-hard Trek fans of all time.
In one of the greatest time travel episodes, ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" found the crew of the Defiant visiting the K-9 space station. They happened to arrive just as Captain Kirk and crew (from TOS) were engaged in what was the episode ""The Trouble with Tribbles."" The set direction, lighting, and fight sequences were all designed to fit seemlessly into the original series episode. All-in-all a fun time.
The serious nature of the season as a whole gave way to a couple of fun episodes. Overall, an excellent season.",1064534400,3,719,4.901639344262295
125443,3,0792146433,"IN THE HANDS OF THE PROPHETS is a solid story featuring power grabs, political intrigue and backstabbing.  It's an episode where some people are not quite what they seem, which is often a tired technique, but one that is executed rather well here.
The episode opens with what seems like a standard Star Trek parallel with real-life events.  Keiko O'Brien is teaching her students a little bit about local geography; in particular, she's describing the solar system's resident wormhole using scientific terms.  This is a problem for the local Bajoran religious leader, who promptly pulls all the Bajoran children out of the classroom and refuses to let them return until O'Brien begins painting the physical phenomena using religious terminology.  This, however, is only the beginning of the story.  Sisko must try to negotiate the situation as it slowly snowballs into something much larger, potentially affecting all of Bajor.
There's a beautiful sequence near the end that is only partially ruined by the inclusion of a clich&eacute;d shot of a slow motion, leaping Sisko yelling ""Noooooooo!""  Overall, I quite liked this episode, although it does go a tiny bit overboard on the pretentiousness.  The plot is carefully crafted, and trying to figure out the loyalties of the secondary characters is indeed a fun game.  A good, strong episode to round out Deep Space Nine's first season.",1061942400,,1387,5.133333333333334
125444,4,0792146433,"This one was definitely a highlight of Deep Space Nine's first season.  Playing with the old wounds of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor, the writers created an intricately constructed story that parallels some real-world events, but adds enough of its own material to retain a unique flavor.
The plot of this episode takes a number of tricky twists, so I won't go into a summary of them here.  It's enough to say that a possible Cardassian war criminal appears on the station, and Kira must determine who he is, and what crimes he committed in the past.  The plot, as it unravels, is diabolical, and had me completely fooled and eager to get to the next revelation.
This is an episode hinging on strong performances and steady direction.  Harris Yulin as the Cardassian is particularly notable.  Two scenes in particular stand out, and I'll try to describe them without giving away any plot points.  In the first scene, we see Yulin's character from Major Kira's point of view, and what she sees is genuinely frightening and unsettling.  In the second scene, the scripted lines are very similar, but Yulin alters his performance, and the direction is just different enough to throw a completely different spin on what is unfolding on the screen.  We see the action through Kira's eyes, and the difference is startling.  Kudos to everyone involved for managing to completely change the tone using only the most subtle of means.
This episode proves that Deep Space Nine can do a terrific episode without leaving its main sets.  In fact, the narrative rarely moves away from three rooms, and this gives the episode an intense and effective claustrophobic feel.  The strong script, excellent performances, and confident direction combine to make this episode one of the best Star Treks that I've seen.  This one is definitely recommended, especially to those people who know that science fiction (and indeed good drama) is far more than mere visuals and special effects.",1061856000,,1968,4.948328267477204
125445,3,0792146433,"Oh dear, Nurse Chapel is back.  Oops, I mean, it's Mrs. Roddenberry.  Wait, no, she's the voice of the computer.  Er, no, it's Lwaxana Troi.  I think.  Well, whomever Majel Barrett is playing this week, she's stuck in a broken-down elevator with poor Odo.  And I tell you, my heart went out to the guy.
Rene Auberjonois gets to demonstrate how to act annoyed, baffled and horrified through his centimeters of thick make-up.  Yes, Momma Troi is looking for love, and she thinks she's found it the variable form of the station's shape-shifter.  And due to some mechanical problem threatening the ship, the two of them become trapped in very close quarters.  It mostly turns out to be as silly as it sounds, but it's thankfully quite entertaining.  As the episode goes on, we actually learn a little bit of what makes Odo tick.  Auberjonois moves from an entertainingly over-the-top, eye-rolling performance into something much more subtle and interesting.  The storyline itself similarly moves from amusing to sweet.
The rest of the episode deals with the Deep Space Nine crew trying to overcome some strange occurrences taking place in the station's subsystems.  It's fairly tame science-fiction stuff, but it's engaging enough.  The Odo subplot is the reason to watch this story.",1061424000,,1279,5.0
125446,3,0792146433,"Figments of the station crew's imagination are taking form and wandering around.  It sounds like a recipe for disaster, given how numerous similar Star Trek episodes have turned out (usually the ones revolving around the holo-decks going faulty -- again).  This one actually ended up being fairly entertaining.  It's silly fluff, but it's fun, silly fluff.
O'Brien's imagination creates Rumpelstiltskin, from the nighttime story he was reading his daughter.  Bashir creates a submissive Jadzia Dax, while Ben and Jake Sisko's imagination brings a stocky Asian baseball player (who quotes Yogi Berra) back to life, two or so centuries after his death.  Outside of Ops, Odo has to deal with some kind of giant alien ostriches, and Quark has conjured up himself a couple of scantily clad Star Trek alien babes.  It's quite a bit of fun.  Naturally, there is an exterior problem (related to the imagination quirk) putting the station in danger.
The resolution of the episode tries to place a bit of seriousness back into the proceedings, but it didn't seem to make a lot of sense.  Still, all things considered, it's a fun, if lightweight episode.",1061424000,,1143,5.042553191489362
125447,4,0792146433,"Throughout PROGRESS, I was convinced that the episode was going to cheat on me, and take the easy way out of the problem.  When it confounded my expectations, I was surprised and extremely pleased.  I hate it when drama dupes the audience by setting up difficult stakes and then ignoring them, so I was very happy to not only see that avoided here, but that the episode itself was quite thoughtful.
Three farmers stand in the way of progress.  Bajor is planning to harvest the molten energy in the core of one of its moons, but to do that all the inhabitants of that moon must relocate.  Three simple farmers refuse to leave.  The cast includes a man who escaped the earlier Cardassian occupation through sheer strength and determination, and two others who were tortured to the point of losing their power of speech (which, of course, meant that the show producers didn't have write lines for them, or pay them for speaking roles).
The story is rather familiar, as, in fact, are the farmers.  It's thanks to a solid performance from Brian Keith as Mullibok, the crusty and cranky old Bajoran, that the story successful so well.  The episode rests on his refusal to leave his home, and the actor and the writing are extremely effective at conveying his point of view.  He's an extremely sympathetic character despite his overblown and arrogant personality.  The episode sinks or swims depending on how likeable the audience finds the farmers, and it is definitely a success on that point.
What I really liked about this one was the fact that there is no real room for a satisfactorily happy ending, and that the episode refuses to take the easy way out.  There's a silly subplot revolving around Jake and Nog trading useless items for more useless items in a vain attempt to eventually get their hands on some gold-pressed latinum.  It's a nice counterpoint to the seriousness of the rest of the story and the overall episode is quite good and very satisfying.",1061251200,,1960,4.718475073313783
125448,2,0792146433,"This is another in a long line of Star Trek episodes proclaiming the utter futility of war and killing.  Unfortunately, it's not one of the better ones.  The central premise is left maddeningly vague, and I was left with the nagging feeling that I'd seen it all before.
Sisko, Kira, Bashir and Kai Opaka (an important Bajoran religious leader) crash-land on a planet inhabited by two opposing factions.  Naturally, they're engaged in a long and bloody conflict, made uninteresting by the fact that there only appear to be about half a dozen in each camp.  In any case, this war has one interesting feature: no one involved in the conflict can ever be killed.  Just when it looks like one side or the other (or both) has been wiped out, they all wake up and go back to their killing.
I didn't hate this episode, but I'd be hard-pressed to find much to recommend about it.  While it doesn't seem to be a complete copy of anything, it does have the feel of something taken from the floor of the Star Trek: The Original Series editing room.",1061251200,,1036,4.5133689839572195
125449,4,0792146433,"There is only one main plot in this one, and I was thankful for that. Modern Star Trek's habit of squeezing two unrelated plots together in the same episode is something that I sometimes find distracting. This was a refreshing change, and it gives the writer(s) enough time to actually flesh out the characters and the story. The plot itself is fairly straightforward when all is said and done, but it's one that is nicely told.
The episode begins with a botched hold-up. One alien kills another, and the victim's brother vows revenge. Not willing to have one of his prisoner's killed while in custody, Odo protects him while he's onboard the station, and then personally escorts him back to his own planet to face his crimes there. The one unusual feature is that the prisoner comes from the far side of the wormhole, somewhere in the Gamma quadrant, and claims to recognize Odo's species. Odo, who believed that he was unique, is interested, despite the alien's history of lying.
Modern Star Trek often places two antagonistic characters in a closed set to see exactly how they interact. The results of these experiments can vary, wildly. Thankfully, this is one of the successes. Cliff DeYoung's performance as Croden, the murderer, is slightly over the top in places, but it suits the character. We aren't quite sure if he's lying or telling the truth when he says that he knows who Odo's people are, and this allows us to uncover the facts along with Odo himself.",1060732800,,1468,4.76078431372549
125450,3,0792146433,"When Deep Space Nine first aired, I never quite realized how goofy it was (at least, during its first season).  Going back and catching episodes that I never saw, I'm surprised at the amount of humor present.  By my reckoning, this is the second episode in a row played almost strictly for laughs and already the third since the season began.
THE NAGUS guest-stars the talented Wallace Shawn as the Nagus of the episode title.  Movie fans will remember Mr. Shawn for his portrayal of the bald, squeaky evil guy in THE PRINCESS BRIDE.  In this episode, he is playing an entirely different sort of bald, squeaky evil guy.  I can't help but laugh anytime Shawn is speaking; his strangely high-pitched voice seems to be tuned exactly to the humor portions of the human mind.  You cannot possibly take his characters seriously, which is why his performances turn out so entertaining.
In addition to the main plot (consisting of Quark succeeding some Ferrengi official or ruler or something), there's a short story of Sisko's son Jake and his budding friendship with a classmate.  It's actually quite sweet, in a way that it wouldn't have been if it had been chosen to be the ""A"" plot.  Since it isn't given much screen-time, it's allowed to stay understated, and it works well that way.
This is a Ferrengi episode, so there isn't much in the way of plot.  It's mostly just a bunch of diminutive extras running around in heavy makeup while pulling ludicrous facial expressions (and only occasionally having a speaking part).  This is not hard science fiction, or gritty, hard-hitting drama.  This is Goof-Ball Central, and it's very amusing.",1060732800,,1635,4.82437275985663
125511,3,0792146433,"MOVE ALONG HOME is what you get when you take the original Star Trek series, add a dash of the television classic, The Prisoner, and mix it all up in the plot of ""The Celestial Toymaker"" episode of Doctor Who.  That is to say, it's not wholly original, and it's not mind-blowingly good, but it is certainly an entertaining piece of television, and an hour that I enjoyed.
This episode is another of those stories where real-life people become pawns in a much larger game -- literally.  Sisko, Bashir, Dax, and Kira are the game-pieces in question, while Quark and Odo are on the outside looking in - with Quark being the one with his hand on the dice.  Much of the story is played for laughs, which is good since as a straight drama it probably wouldn't have worked.  But the gags are never less than enjoyable, and at best, they are laugh-out-loud funny.
This isn't a great episode of television, but it's certainly watchable.  It entertained me for the most part, and I can't complain too much about that.  It's breezy, amusing, and doesn't take itself very seriously.",1060473600,,1070,4.605263157894737
125512,3,0792146433,"When Deep Space Nine first came on the scene, it was billed as a darker and grittier version of the Star Trek brand that we all knew.  The first few episodes definitely set a more realistic tone than that which had come before.  The characters didn't like each other.  There were political battles.  Not everything on the space station worked properly.  We weren't quite sure where everyone's allegiances lay.
So, my guess is that, to reassure fans that things wouldn't be going too far into the realm of ultra-violence, the powers that be decided to throw a rather goofy episode into the mix fairly early on.  The plot of BABEL revolves around a virus that has been released into the space station.  But not just any old virus; this one has the power to make people completely unintelligible.  The virus attacks the portions of the mind dealing with language, causing people to say or write random words and gibberish sentences when trying to convey concepts.
Now, I'll bet there isn't anyone who could read that description and not suddenly think of what that scenario would be like if it took place on the original Enterprise.  Is there a man, woman, or child alive today who wouldn't thrill at the opportunity to see William Shatner reciting random gibberish with such conviction, to see him putting pauses of variable length in between words of varying meaning?  I think not.
For what it is, I found this episode to be quite entertaining.  Most of it is played for laughs, from the absurdity of the virus' manifestation, to the fact that Odo and Quark must become uneasy, bickering, and squabbling allies.  There are a few serious moments to remind us of what show we're watching, the most effective being a scene towards the end where Kira becomes delightfully vicious with a bio-weapons scientist.  Other than that, this is just a fun hour of television.  It gave the feeling of the Original Trek without actually rehashing anything; this was much more successful than The Next Generation's similar early attempt at levity.",1059523200,,2030,4.829479768786127

125515,5,0792146433,"Just when we thought it couldn't get any better,DS9's fifth season proves there is so much more to the show once described about a station that didn't ""go anywhere"".When most TV shows wear out their welcome by season five,ST-DS9 just kept getting better

The episode ""Whispers"" in which Miles Obrien returns to DS9 to find that all is not as it should be stikes a remarkable resemblance to the movie staring Gary Sinise - IMPOSTER. I'm curious as to which story is the original. As this episode was part of DS9's second season and the movie came out much later, it appears as though there was a slight ""borrowing"" of a story line here. If anyone has seen both the episode and the movie and can offer some enlightenment, please do so. Thank You.",1043452800,,551,4.2075471698113205

John Colicos and Michael Ansara reprise their roles as Klingon warriors and William Campbell, memorable in the classic ""Squire of Gothos"" episode, also dons the garb of a member of the warrior race.
What I liked most about this series is its use of skilled character actors and this episode is no exception. The three thespians relish their roles and play them with much gusto. The storyline allows each to bring his distinctive interpretation of a Klingon officer. They balance perfectly and play well with the younger Terry Ferrell in the role of the popular ""Dax"".
This is indeed one of the best in Trek history.",1039910400,,727,4.824
125518,5,0792146433,"Just as The Next Generation did during its inaugural season, DS9 patterned some of its first season entries after successful shows from earlier Trek incarnations.  'If Wishes Were Horses' is a sort of hybrid of plot elements from the episodes 'Shore Leave' from The Original Series and 'The Royale' from TNG.  The story presented here is as entertaining as each of those two and even improves on the formula, incorporating more humor and finding a way to involve all the crewmembers - despite the proud and contrary nature of a select few.
An unusual spatial anomaly appears on the DS9 scanners that can't be identified by the station's science officers. After O'Brien and his wife finish reading the tale of Rumpelstiltskin to their daughter and tuck her into bed she comes out from her bedroom scant moments later telling them that Rumpelstiltskin is in her room.  Naturally disbelieving her they go into her bedroom and find the fairy tale character is quite alive and ready to offer his services.  Earlier in the show's teaser Bashir had confessed to Dax an undying affection for her but she graciously turns him away.  Some time later he is awakened from sleep in his quarters by an unusually vivacious Dax seeking his romantic advances; within a few minutes he will discover that Dax is on the bridge and the one pursuing him is a visage created from his mind.  Adding another twist to the proceedings Jake brings someone to meet his father - the captain's baseball idol Buck Bokai who has been dead for well over 200 years.  During all this the anomaly has become a dangerous rupture in space that threatens to envelope all of Bajoran space destroying everything in the process.  Meanwhile the three new visitors to DS9 prove to be a real conundrum, creating quite a stir attempting to interact with O'Brien, Bashir and both Captain Sisko and Jake.  Eventually their apparitions are tied to the appearance of the spatial anomaly and the captain also discovers the, by now unwelcome, trio's vulnerability that leads to an unexpected resolution.
Though the story is heavily influenced by 'Shore Leave', a fan favorite, what's onscreen works marvelously well, making great use of the DS9 denizens and familiar space station areas, providing many humorous moments - especially those involving Odo and Quark who threaten to steal the show entirely in their few scenes.  A snowstorm on the Promenade and later a few emus running about; everyone winning at Dabo on every roll; Quark's mysterious incarceration; the final revelation about the spatial anomaly and many other touches add up to a great mystery that is both fun and absorbing as it unfolds.  In a spirited flourish to the episode when Buck Bokai tempts Jake to forget his homework and come to the holosuite to play ball, an apparition of the captain appears behind Jake's left shoulder acting quite impish enjoying the boy's predicament.  The conversation between Odo and Quark in the show's opener is priceless as well, with Odo insisting that he doesn't have any fantasies as they are a waste of time; we will find out soon enough how grievously wrong that statement is.  In fact none of the DS9 players escapes the lair of their imagination with everyone eventually becoming a victim of sorts.  'If Wishes Were Horses' is an excellent early effort by DS9 and in my humble opinion was of the series most memorable episodes.",1039737600,,3387,4.888307155322862
125519,4,0792146433,"The name of the game is Chula...and it comes from melding two of the words of a popular children's game called ""Chutes And Ladders"" - no kidding!  The writers of this episode took a close look at several types of games in order to come up with the design for the one played here, hence the name Chula.  'Move Along Home' is another one of those shows in the Trek catalogue that cause fans to debate its merits.  Though it strays from the course of events that have unfolded in the previous nine episodes it still provides some solid entertainment and manages to create some suspense as well.
Sisko, Kira, Dax and Bashir prepare to welcome the Wadi, a new alien race from the Gamma Quadrant, to DS9.  Upon arrival the Wadi dispense with the stuffy diplomacy of First Contact and insist they be taken to Quark's Bar so they can play games.  Once there they tempt Quark with some valuable looking gemstones and he escorts them to the Dabo table - immediately.  When the Wadi prove too adept at beating the odds of Dabo, Quark begins cheating them so they will ""stop cutting into his profits.""  The Wadi's leader Falow catches the Ferengi cheating and challenges him to a game called Chula.  Falow won't tell Quark the rules explaining to him that he has to learn them as he plays the game.  When the two begin their game Sisko, Kira, Dax and Bashir awaken to find themselves trapped in a bizarre and surreal labyrinthine structure.  Jake reports his father is missing to Odo who further finds that the other three officers are also missing.  Soon he and Quark realize that the four game pieces Quark is playing Chula with are representative of the four missing officers and that he may or may not be playing for their survival.
'Move Along Home' is mainly concerned with spotlighting the character of Quark and he is fun to watch throughout the episode, changing from a shrewd businessman into a groveling pathetic mess.  Granted, it is easy for anyone to reason that the Wadi aren't going to bring harm to the four officers but it is reasonably suspenseful and the set design is terrific.  There's plenty of humor scattered throughout as well and both Odo and Kira vent about their uneasy association with the rules and regulations of the Federation.  The story is derivative of an episode of the superior television series ""The Prisoner"" (titled 'Checkmate') where the residents of The Village are used as chess pieces in a chess match.  Chula looks to be quite an intriguing game!  If you took the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, crossed it with Stratego and added a few rudimentary rules of chess you would come close to the game of Chula.  There are a few sly references to Dungeons & Dragons here and if you're familiar with that game you'll pick on them.",1039132800,,2764,4.631147540983607
125520,5,0792146433,"Returning to DS9 after a short absence Miles O'Brien slowly finds that he has stumbled unto a potential conspiracy that the Federation may or may not be a part of.  As he tries to untangle what he believes is a plot to disrupt an upcoming peace conference, the Chief is constantly diverted and encounters many peculiarities among the crew members.  The conundrum becomes a full blown conspiracy when he is summoned to Odo's office where the DS9 staff officers draw weapons on him and order him to surrender!  I don't want to give away the mystery any more than that, but be certain that you watch this one if you haven't yet.
Borrowing liberally from the 1956 sci-fi masterpiece ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" and mixing in a small dosage of ""Blade Runner"" and adding just a touch of ""The Manchurian Candidate"", the writers of DS9 create an exceptional mystery.  The political themes and undertones so present in those classic films are retained here as well, injected occasionally building an uncomfortable amount of tension for the Chief to endure.
Flashback episodes can be cliched and pedestrian by nature but the Star Trek writers breathe new life into that tiresome vehicle here.  ""Whispers"" is a uniquely filmed episode because O'Brien is featured in literally every shot.  Every line of dialogue that is heard in this episode is a conversation that he has with another of the DS9 crew members.  This technique works great for the story as we become totally convinced that O'Brien is right to suspect the crew of deception.  Also, the ending of this episode is well constructed - it provides a great twist and a satisfying explanation for the strange happenings.
A few notes:  In this show O'Brien is referred to as a replicant, the term used in the film ""Blade Runner"".  Wisely, both the Trek creators and writers decided against using the term android which would have caused some small confusion considering it is so closely associated with Data.  Using replicant also works effectively because in ""Blade Runner"" the replicants were on the run - O'Brien eventually does too toward the end of the episode.  I've noticed also that O'Brien has to be DS9's most durable and put-upon crew member.  After this ordeal he would suffer through worse personal trials on such episodes as the later ""Tribunal"" and ""Hard Times"".",1037577600,,2327,4.89058524173028

A lot of DS9 episodes may take a little familiarity with the backstory to appreciate, but this episode stands firmly on its own 2 feet. You get all the exposition you need, and the payoff at the end is powerful.  Plus, Harris Yulin's performance as the Cardasian suspect is nothing short of awesome.

125553,5,0792146433,"Episode title: ""The Wire""
Written by: Robert Hewitt Wolfe
Directed by: Kim Friedman
""The Wire"" can possibly be called the very best episode of the second season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. It offers new insights to the character of Garak, who was introduced in the early first season episode ""Past Prologue"", in wich he promised to be either one of the worst or one of the best written characters in Star Trek's history.
It took almost a year for him to re-appear in the suberb and informative early second season episode ""Cardassians"", after wich he was given some further information about in the episode ""Profit and Loss"". At this point even the bad writing and plot of the episode couldn't put out the intrique the character had inspired.
Then came ""The Wire"", in wich Doctor Bashir, who hadn't had much to contribute earlier on to the  series, is given the spotlight as he notices that something is wrong with his cardassian lunch-partner.
The episode unravels information about Garak's true past, introducing the Cardassian intelligence organization called The Obsidian Order, opening whole new continuing storylines for the whole series.
We get some strong and well performed scenes between Garak and Bashir, as the latter solves the mystery of a presumably Obsidian Order planted device that's malfunction causes deadly symptoms to Garak. Especially Siddig El Fadil exeeds himself, making the interaction between himself and the highly talented Andrew Robinson (Garak) not nearly as one-sided as it might have been expected to be.
By the end of the episode nothing conclusive is revealed and many things that are highly conclusive are revealed. You really don't know even after all the information given throughout the dark, well constructed and exeplaryly directed episode, wich awakens a great interest towards Cardassian society, deepens the character of Doctor Julian Bashir and constucts the character of Garak to the point where he isn't just ""the mysterious Cardassian tailor who has lunch with 'the good doctor' "", but finally becomes a real, multi-dimencional character.",1006473600,,2090,5.201780415430267
125554,4,0792146433,"In the great tradition both the Classic and the Next Generation Star Trek series, ""If Wishes Were Horses"" is the Deep Space Nine episode where desires become manifest.  Instead of the White Rabbit or Picard's mother this time around we get Rumpelstiltskin from the bedtime story O'Brien reads to Molly, Sisko's favorite baseball player the great Buck Bokai, a gunji jackdaw that Odo is chasing around the promenade deck, and a Dax who has the hots for Bashir.  Yes, something strange is happening on DS9 and it is up to the real Dax to figure out why this is happening.  This is a pleasant little episode, where the characters all get some nice bits to do without it being a life and death situation.  I always like to see the series touch upon Sisko's love for baseball, because it suggests the game will still be going strong in the 24th century despite the concerted effort of the current idiot owners and stupid players doing their best to destroy the game.  If you do not like baseball just think of Sisko meeting Bokai as being the equivalent of Jim Kirk getting to meet Abraham Lincoln.",994896000,,1093,4.61340206185567
125555,4,0792146433,"Some major implications for the Deep Space Nine series come out of the ""Battlelines"" episode.  Kai Opaka, the spiritual leader of the Bajoran people, insists on accompanying Sisko on a runabout that is exploring the Gamma Quadrant.  Receiving a strange signal from a moon in one of the unexplored systems they investigate and discover a satellite system that suddenly attacks the runabout.  In the crash, Kai Opaka is fatally injured.  Sisko, Kira and Bashir explore their surroundings and discover that two warring factions, the Ennis and the Nol-Ennis, had been banished to the moon centuries earlier for refusing to give up their blood feud.  At this point, Kai Opaka appears on the scene, apparently quite alive.  It turns out that everybody on the planet has little tiny biomechanical devices that repair any physical damage done to people when they die.  Of course, as a result of these marvelous little devices, the people are totally dependent on them and cannot lean the environment of the moon.
The fate of Kai Opaka has major implications for not only Sisko and Kira but also the entire relationship between the Federation and Bajor.  In a word, this opens the door for Kai Winn, and we all know what fun she gets to be down the road.  ""Battlelines"" is one of those science-fiction stories where the writers come up with a neat idea, in this case the medical nanites, and then ignore the practical implications of such technology because it would mess up their story.  My best guess is that the idea was that if the Ennis and the Nol-Ennis found it was impossible to kill each other that they would give up their blood feud.  After all, neither side is ever going to win since it is impossible to exterminate the other side.  Then again, if these two sides have been trapped on this moon for centuries, how come no one in all that time has tested the limitations of the little robots?  Just think of all the things you can do to someone that you would have to think would put a body beyond repair.  Still, I must admit I like the idea of trying to make the two sides realize the futility of their efforts.  With the aforementioned grain of salt, ""Battlelines"" is a slightly above average DS9 episode.",994896000,,2211,4.677002583979328
125556,5,0792146433,"When Kai Opaka comes to DS9 to take up Commander Sisko's offer for a station tour--things happen in this episode that have implications for the rest of the series.
Opaka seems to have some clue as to what is going to happen early on when she admits that she has been preoccupied with prophecy.  With a very subtle hint, she gets Sisko to take her up in a runabout to see the wormhole/Celestial Temple.  Her preoccupation becomes justified in this episode when the runabout Yangtze Kiang crashes on a moon in the Gamma Quadrant.  While Sisko, Kira, and Bashir survive the crash--peril befalls the Kai.  The crew finds that the moon is a penal colony and is introduced quickly to a deadly battle between the two factions.  As people lay dead around them, a resurrected Opaka walks in! All the casualties of the battle are resurrected too!
This episode in interesting in that it portrays war in a different light.  The moon's residents have been banished to perpetual war without the possibility of death--and they have only known fighting and survival for all their existence on the moon.  In Opaka's words, ""They have forgotten how to live...""
This is an episode that reveals some of Major Kira's character.  It shows here softer more spiritual side in her reaction to Opaka's death.  There is a very touching scene in which Kira has to admit that she is holding on to a lot of her aggression from the Cardassian Occupation.  The irony is the Kira is a microcosm of what is occurring on the moon.  The Kai tells Kira ""I was brought here because it is time for these people to begin their healing process, just as you were brought her to begin yours.""  Opaka stays on the moon and sets the stage for a power/spiritual vacuum on Bajor--and more political intrigue for the rest of the series (this is a pre-Vedek Win episode).
The Kai's remaining on the moon is interesting.  A spiritual leader in a place very far from religion, G-d, or the Bajorn Prophets presents a daunting task for Opaka.  She definitely has her work cut out for her.  It really sets Opaka in stark contrast to the next successor to the Kai-ship.  It also shows how strong her faith is strong in the face of eternity in a violent, motivationally starved land.  She doesn't feel doomed--but rather she is answering the call of the Prophets.  It is opportunity rather than punishment.  I wish that this situation could have been revisited later in the series and we could see if the Kai made a difference.  Maybe will be as DS9 continues in book form (hint to authors...).",993168000,5,2538,4.622767857142857

Ever since The Next Generation, we knew that Bajorans and Cardassians did not get along, and Cardassians occupied Bajor for over 50 years. This episode provides some additional information about the long occupation, and what it did to both Bajor, as well as Cardassia, and some Cardassians.  Major Kira was surprised to learn that a Cardassian suffering from Kalla-Nohra syndrome came aboard DS9. After all, only a Cardassian working at the Gallitep labor camp could ever have contracted this disease. And, considering the atrocities committed at Gallitep, any Cardassian working there would be considered a war criminal by the Bajoran government.
Under arrest, this Cardassian identifies himself as Amin Moritzza, professor at a Cardassian military school.... Kira hopes to use Moritzza as an example, to get some ""justice"" for Bajor. However, it seems Moritzza was a filing clerk at Gallitep. A very good filing clerk, it turns out, but a filing clerk none-the-less. Now, it seems, he teaches... ""Filing.""
As an aside -- Cardassians are very concerned with detail. So it's great to see the Cardassians never underestimate the power of a good file clerk...
Kira is disappointed. She later finds out, however, that he was actually Gul Dar'heel, the labor camp's coordinator -- also known as the ""Butcher of Gallitepp."" Justice for Bajor seems within reach. However, why would  such a wanted man request passage to a Bajoran station? Oddly enough, it seems he wanted to be caught...
As Kira interrogates Dar'Heel, we learn what happened on Bajor during the occupation, from both sides. Dar'Heel's performance is brilliant in its depravity, arrogance and boldness, as he torments and instigates Kira by proudly ranting on about the costs of building the Cardassian Empire through the use of force, fear and intimidation on Bajor. Kira is obviously enraged, until she learns the truth about her prisoner.
Indeed, her prisoner is not what she hopes for. Instead, he turns out to be a not so-diabolical man after all... Instead, he is an honorable man, with a guilt-laden conscience and a political agenda. And through all of this, Kira must also reevaluate her own agenda...
This is a very strong and powerful episode. There are lots of plot twists (I'll save them for you!), with excellent and emotional performances. It is a must see!",970358400,4,2380,5.081841432225064

A Bajoran man comes aboard with his Cardassian son,Rugal. No, Rugal is no half breed, and is certainly not the recipientof plastic surgery. Rugal is a Cardassian war orphan, left on Bajorafter the withdrawal, but now adopted by a devout and kind Bajoranfamily. When Garak introduces himself to the boy, he is viciously bitby the boy. After all, as Rugal tell us, Cardassians are evil. And, welearn also learn that Rugal is no longer Cardassian. He isBajoran.
After all, identity IS a cultural construct, not abiological fact? Isn't it....? Rugal has been raised Bajoran, actsBajoran, and therefore IS Bajoran, despite the very attractive neckridges.  This message is one of the most profound messages everpresented in the Trek Universe... (I mean about identity, not theattractiveness of neck ridges...)
In this episode we learn that toabandon a child, or otherwise do harm to one's family, is the greatestdishonor and disgrace on Cardassia. ""On Cardassia, family iseverything."" We also learn about some of the social policy andtraditions on Cardassia, such as how orphans have no status in thatsociety.
Back to the plot... The custody of Rugal becomes an issuewhen it is discovered that he is not an orphan, but the son of a quiteimportant Civilian leader, P'Dar... who coincidentally was involved inthe decision to withdraw from Bajor... and who is coincidentallyenemies with Gul Dukat... who coincidentally oppossed the withdrawalfrom Bajor.. and who coincidentally is also Garak's enemy...  whocoincidentally gets sucked into the whole mess simply by eating lunchwith Bashir on the promenade that day...
Which coincidentallybrings me to the brilliant comment made by Garak... ""I believe incoincidences.  Coincidences happen every day. But I don't trustcoincidences...""
You're a clever guy, Garak. Trying to frameP'Dar for abandonning his son on Bajor, Dukat has played Rugal, P'Dar,and even Sisko and Bashir like pawns on a Kotra board... But don'tworry, kind reader. The mystery is solved... Garak saw through all thelies...",970099200,2,2232,5.408045977011494

125624,5,0792146433,"In this episode, our favorite Cardassian ""mender of pants"" and ""hemmer of skirts"" - Garak - literally comes apart at the seams. Or so it seems...
The episode begins as Dr. Julian Bashir notices his occassional lunchmate, playmate and object of his constant curiosity, Garak the tailor, is suffering from a not-so-mild headache. This headache, however, is caused by an implant, placed in Garak's brain, by the deliciously despicable Obsidian Order. The breakdown of this ""wire"" turns out to be a catalyst through which Bashir tries to learn about Garak's past, and an opportunity for Garak to practice tormenting the good doctor with all kinds of lies and fiction, even as he writhes in agony, or tries to drown his pain in numerous bottles of kanar.
Throughout the episode, as Garak literally falls apart and Bashir tries to help save him, we watch their friendship develop. We are introduced to the Obsidian Order, and it's former master, Enabrin Tain. More importantly, we learn the truth about Garak's past... And that truth is that it is made up of nothing but possible truths and probable lies. The contradiction is poetic... In fact, after viewing the episode, we still have no real knowledge about the mysterious Garak, or the circumstances leading to his exile on DS9. Instead, what we have are a series of half truths, bald-faced lies, and sob stories, brilliantly executed in classic Garak style.
My favorite scene, however, peaks when the Ferengi Quark is affectionately called a ""parasite"" by an uncommonly jovial and obviously raunchy Cardassian called Boheeka... For that alone it is worth the shipping and handling costs...
It would be a lie to say this was not my favorite DS9 episode. But that's what it's all about, isn't it, Mr. Garak? Lies, deception, and all other types of poetry in motion...",969753600,5,1814,4.970394736842105

We also learn just a little more (but not too much!) about the past political connections of our mysterious Cardassian tailor Garak...as well as what he considers to be the meaning of love. And although it was never love at first sight between Quark and Odo, we even see some early signs of a friendship between them blossom in this episode.
The supporting Cardassian characters -- dissident students Rekelen and Hogue, and Gul Toran provide additional insight into the political atmosphere on Cardassia, and offer a peek at the dangers of potential dissent in the face of military crackdown in that part of the Alpha Quadrant.

A half-hearted plan to ""eject the  ship into space"" begins that turns into one of those 'manage to save  the day one second before the station was about to blow up' plots.

125630,5,0792146433,"One of Deep Space Nine's more intriguing elements is the relationship between the Cardassians and Bajorans.  As you probably already know, the Cardassians enslaved, abused and were generally quite rude to the Bajorans  for over fifty years.  Now Bajor has it's freedom but the two species  remain hostile toward one another.  So when a Cardassian, claiming to be an  infamous war criminal, arrives on DS9 with the sole purpose to be executed  for his crimes, DS9's Bajoran first officer, Major Kira Nerys, must decide  if this is indeed the hated general who committed hundreds of attrocities  against the Bajorans or if something else is at stake.
The interplay  between Kira and the supposed Cardassian criminal is both intricate and  fascinating as both dance the dance that comes with interrogation.  Kira  tries to find out why this man wants to be executed and the  ""criminal"" attempts to prove that he is, indeed,  this evil  Cardassian that plagued Bajor.  I won't reveal the ending for those of you  that haven't seen this superb episode but I will say this: Things aren't  what they seem and the ending is both surprising and  tragic.
""Duet"" is the best episode of DS9's first season and,  overall, one of the best episodes of any Trek series.  And Major Kira, a  character I'm not fond of, is at her best here, this is THE Kira episode to  own.",962755200,4,1355,4.766233766233766
125661,5,0792146433,"In Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's second season, we see this wonderful series really begin to grow and mature.  This is exemplified by the episode ""Blood Oath"".
Three Klingons, each of whom first appeared in  The Original Series, return to Star Trek!  Kor (from the TOS episode  ""Errand of Mercy""), Koloth (from ""The Trouble with  Tribbles"") and Kang (""Day of the Dove"") all meet up with Dax  on DS9 to fulfill a Blood Oath the four of them took over 80 years ago.  It  seems a renegade Klingon swore revenge on Kor, Koloth and Kang and  succeeded in fulfilling that promise by killing each of the threesome's  eldest sons.  Curzon Dax, who was negotiating peace treaties with the  Klingon Empire at the time and had become close to Kang, took a Blood Oath  with Kang and company to one day find the renegade and kill him.  Only  problem is that the Oath was made with Dax's previous host, Curzon and not  Jadzia, Dax's current incarnation (you're familiar with the Trill, right?).  Kor doesn't have a problem with this but Kang and Koloth only see a young  woman with little experience and their mission of vengeance seems  ill-suited for her.  Eventually, Dax convinces them to let her come along,  not fully realizing how violent it will be and what it means to take a  life.
This is a powerful episode and the violence that marks Jadzia's  coming of age is not glorified: It is violent, bloody and tragic.  Jadzia  grows here but it is a maturation process that she could have done without.  Klingons claim that killing in a just cause is glorious but all we see is  death and destruction.  A coming of age indeed but one that Jadzia realizes  she could have skipped.
This is the best episode of DS9's first two  seasons.  It is a good Klingon episode and, perhaps, the best Dax episode.",962582400,2,1789,4.5664556962025316

Yes, it does appear to be a knock-off of  the Barbara Streisand movie ""Yentl,"" where a 19th-century Jewish  woman disguises herself as a man in order to attend an all-male rabbinical  school.  Because of this similarity in plot, which I had heard about before  viewing the DS9 episode, I expected to hate this video, because I can't  stand ""Yentl.""  But surprisingly, I really LIKED this Trek  episode!
 Although the two stories are superficially similar, there is  one really big difference:  The stereotyped Hasidic Jews portrayed in  ""Yentl"" are not like that in real life, so the Streisand movie  comes across as mere buffoonery.  But the Ferengi truly are the greedy  little sexists that this episode portrays them to be -- and proud of it,  too!  So ""Rules of Aquisition"" is about real Ferengi culture as  it is, not a satire.  Yes, there are moments of hilarious humor, but there  is also a genuine tenderness about Pel's quandry when she falls in love  with Quark and decides to reveal her true gender to him.  One gets the  feeling that Quark really likes her, too,  and that he admires her skills  in business -- but both of them know it would never work out. Still, Quark  does give Pel a gift of latinum to help her start a new life in some other  part of the galaxy.
 All in all, this video that I expected to hate has  turned out to be one of my favorite DS9 episodes.  It's one you will enjoy  watching over and over, too.",958003200,6,1615,4.538461538461538
