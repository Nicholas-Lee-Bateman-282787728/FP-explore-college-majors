8346026,5,B001VCA49I,"A fascinating documentary for the life and career of the exquisite Dusty Springfield.
Very professional, excellent quality release.
This is comprised of many insightful interviews and anecdotes of Dusty's closest friends and colleagues including Herself.
There are also a number of photos and clips from rare performances.
Very well directed and much useful information. Tremendous resource value.
This is by far the absolute best biography for Dusty Springfield I have seen.

There are additional intimate comments in these extras-

Tea With Dusty (8 min)
A friendly round table discussion/memorial.

Anecdotes (22 min)
Very personal, revealing thoughts and memories.

There is also a collection of complete performances mostly from later in Dusty's career. Not presented in the highest quality definition but most are very good.
Very worthwhile to see.

8346027,3,B001VCA49I,"I was disappointed by this DVD.  The early songs, on the main feature, were all too often interrupted by people's comments, between songs is fine but during... not pleasant.  The extra features included the complete performances so I thought this wouldn't be an issue but they were even the same performances!  They were all later years and none of the early ones.",1416268800,,364,4.838709677419355
8346028,5,B001VCA49I,"I never really knew much about Dusty's personal life.  She was so talented.  It's ashame she had so little confidence.  This DVD is really great.  It lets you hear all the commentary from her friends, and then just go back and listen and watch all her wonderful performances.",1357603200,2,275,4.666666666666667
8346029,5,B001VCA49I,With all due respect to Aretha Franklin and the ebony divas of the 1960's you've gotta rate the late great Dusty Springfield right up there with them. For you kids that were born after her heyday just listen to the CD Dusty Springfield Gold and simply judge for yourselves. This DVD which once appeared on TV will let you in to the complicated life of a woman way way ahead of her time. From her lifestyle to her ability to control ALL ASPECTS of her performances she would be happy living in today's music industry. But unfortunately it was the 60's and she did the best she could. And that was darn good indeed. Her recordings can be seen in their entirety in her DVD Once upon a time. So if you really want to know the definition of Blue Eyed Soul listen to Dusty.,1355529600,,767,4.296551724137931
