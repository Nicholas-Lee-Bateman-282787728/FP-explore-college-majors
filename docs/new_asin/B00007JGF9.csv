1813043,4,B00007JGF9,I purchased this combo because I thought my daughter (8) would like to watch the dancing and singing however the sexual content would be a little much for her at this age. I think the PG rating was a little misleading.,1374364800,,218,4.341463414634147

1813249,5,B00007JGF9,"Not a review of the movies which are both great. This double feature pack is a tremendous value. You get two blu-ray discs, one for each movies, each packed with features. The Saturday Night Fever blu ray is the 30th anniversary edition with all its special features. This is listed on the box. What isn't listed is that the Grease blu ray is the Rockin Rydell edition with all its special features. Not much of the way in packaging, a two-disc blu-ray case with single-side printed cover art, but you get (as of this review) a $7 movie and a $9 movie for $8. You can't beat that. This double features is like getting a free movie.",1446681600,13,631,4.401709401709402
1813319,4,B00007JGF9,Very happy with the price. Couldn't find SNF anywhere in stores on blu ray.,1439078400,,75,4.428571428571429
1813320,5,B00007JGF9,"SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER [1977/118 mins]: This is the classic disco movie from the late 1970's that bolted John Travolta and his dance moves to super-stardom. It is the story of young Tony Manero(played by Travolta) who lives with his parents in Bay Ridge and works a dead-end job at a local hardware store but struts his stuff during weekends at the 2001 Odyssey. Amazing dancing from and energetic music(from the Bee Gees) amidst the various turmoil of Tony Mareno's life.

There's a nice chunk of special features for Fever and most are from the 30th Anniversary release from 2007. These include: 1] Commentary track by Director John Badham(from the 25th Anniversary release). Badham is very informative and manages to squeeze in lots of behind-the-scenes info 2] '70's Discopedia'. Sort of a pop-up video with various factoids and this plays for the whole movie. 3] 'Catching the Fever'(52:32). Nice featurette with appearances from many of the cast members.

4] Back to Bay Ridge(9:00). Hosted by Joseph Cali as he visits various old haunts such as the pizza shop and the hardware store in Bay Ridge. 5]'Dance Like Travolta with John Cassese'(9:50). A quick tutorial by dancing instructor John Cassese. 6]'Fever Challenge'(4:00). Follow the on-screen lighted squares. 7]Deleted Scenes(3:36). There are three scenes in total. And lastly there are subtitles in English/French/Portugese/Spanish.

GREASE [1978/110 mins]: A musical love story that takes place in the late 1950's and adapted from a broadway musical. This is the movie that helped elevate Olivia Newton-John to super-star status. The story features innocent Sandy Olsen(Olivia) falling in love with Danny Zuko(Travolta), the leader of the Greaser gang at Rydell High. The movie features some entertaining and memorable musical numbers with Travolta and Newton-John as well as with the rest of the crew.

There is a ton of special features for Grease. These include: 1]Commentary track with Director Randal Kleiser & Choreographer Patricia Birch. 2]Intro by Randal Kleiser(:24) 3]Rydell Sing-Along 4]'The Time, The Place, The Motion: Remembering Grease'(22:27) 5]Deleted/Extended/Alternate Scenes(10:16). All the scenes are in b&w. 6]Grease on DVD Launch Party(15:13). From 2002. Features a stage performance from Travolta and Newton-John. 7]'Grease Memories from John & Olivia(3:25) 8]'The Moves Behind the Music(8:14) 9]'Thunder Roadsters'(5:23). A quick look at some classic cars. 10]'John Travolta and Allan Carr ""Grease Day"" Interview'(1:47) 11]'Olivia Newton-John and Robert Stigwood ""Grease Day"" Interview'(2:07) 12]Photo Galleries: 'Rydell High Year Book', 'Production', 'Premiere', 'Grease Day'. 13]Theatrical Trailer(2:11).

All together this is a great package as it not only features the two movies but also a whole load of special features. Many of these newer Blu-rays that include two or more movies are bare-bone sets with just the movies minus any special features. For me I like having the special features as it increases the overall value of the Blu-ray with all the extra content(and they are fun to watch). Good, clear picture quality for both movies and the audio is nice and vibrant.",1438473600,6,3168,5.496919917864476
