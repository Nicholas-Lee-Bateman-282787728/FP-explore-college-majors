8433334,4,B004KRQFQW,"Back in 2004, light novelist Ryohgo Narita, who won a Gold Prize in the 9th Dengeki Novel Prize for ""Baccano!"" returned with ""Durarara!!"" and teaming up with illustrator Suzuhito YAsuda (known for his video game work ""Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor"").

With a total of eight volumes published in Japan by ASCII Media Works (ala their Dengeki Bunko imprint), a manga adaptation would be created by Akiyo Satorigi and published in the shonen magazine ""Monthly GFantasy"" in 2009. The popularity of Narita's works, especially with ""Baccano!"" would lead to an animate adaptation of ""Durarara!!"" in January 2010. And now the series has been released in the USA courtesy of Aniplex, Inc.

The anime production for ""Durarara!!"" is by Brains Base (""Brave Story"", ""Kure-nai"", ""Spice and Wolf II"", ""New Getter Robo"", ""Akikan!"") and the series is directed by Takahiro Omori (""Aruna"", ""Gakuen Alice"", ""Kuragehime"", ""Zoku Natsume Yujin-Cho"") with series composition/script by Noboru Takagi (""Baccano!"", ""C"", ""Koi Kaze"").

The series features an ensemble cast and their experience living in Ikebukuro, Tokyo but how their storylines are somewhat connected to each other.

Mikado Ryugamine is a young man who transfers to school from a small country town to the big city in Tokyo and his childhood friend Masaomi tries to show him the ropes of Ikebukuro, which can be dangerous as color gangs have corrupted the city.

Before the yellow scarves were the dominant gang and now on top of the gangs are a mysterious group known as the Dollars, with a leader that no one knows about, all that is known is that members are chosen and are hooked up through the Internet.

But recently, there have been several deaths causes by a murderer dubbed ""The Slasher"" and also rumors of a headless woman riding a motorcycle.

The main characters of ""Durarara!!"" are:

  * Mikado Ryugamine - A first year high schooler who moves to Ikebukuro, Tokyo after his childhood friend Masaomi had invited him. A shy guy, Mikado is trying to learn the ropes and restart his life.

Mikado just wants to change and not be normal.

VIDEO:

""Durarara!!"" features is presented in 16:9 LB.

I'm confident to say that ""Durarara!!"" has one of the best look animation and artist backgrounds that I have seen in years. In 2010, I felt that Production I.G. raised the bar for artistic backgrounds for televised anime series with ""Eden of the East"" and ""Ghost Hound"" but I have to really give credit to Stuio Base and art director Akira Ito for doing a magnificent job in capturing the look and feel of Ikebukuro, Tokyo.

Almost every scene is new. Rarely in this series do you see re-used art background scenes and every location featured in ""Durarara!!"", there is magnificent detail, vibrant colors, deep blacks and literally I was impressed. Personally, ""Durarara!!"" would be best suited for an HD release on Blu-ray because it looks so fantastic! The animation and character designs are wonderful and the style of the character design and the art backgrounds have great balance.

This has to be one of the best looking anime series and you typically do not get this much effort for a televised anime series. It just doesn't happen due to the tight schedules of anime production companies. So, ""Durarara!!"" was a pleasant surprise but literally left me in awe.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Durarara!!"" is presented in Japanese and English Dolby Digital 2.0. Audio quality is very good for stereo tracks, dialogue and music is quite clear. While the Japanese voice acting was top-notch, I also gave the English dub a try and for the most part, it was well-done! The only thing I do wish that Bang Zoom had done for the English soundtrack was to give it a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround soundtrack instead of 2.0.

I chose to have my receiver set to Stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Durarara!! part 02' comes with the following special features:

  * Uragiri no Yuyake - (3:34) Featuring the music video for ""Uragiri no Yuyake"" by Theatre Brook.
  * Trust Me - (5:30) Featuring the music video ""Trust Me"" performed by Yuya Matsushita.
  * Trailers - Trailers for upcoming Aniplex Series.
  * Credits - Credits for ""Durarara!!"".

EXTRAS:

""Durarara!! part 02' comes with a digipak with a plastic slipcase. Also, included are four postcards.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Once in a while, you will find an anime series that just surprises you for its storyline, animation, art background and overall presentation. ""Durarara!!"" is an anime that literally surprised me by its quality and I have to say, this is one of the coolest anime series I have seen in awhile.

For anime series, you often seen the banality of reused storylines with slight changes and different animation and for the most part, while characters and storyline are different, things are much similar in concept. With ""Durarara!!"", while not as dark as ""Boogiepop Phantom"", and the fact it is created by ""Baccano!"" writer Ryohgo Narita, he still manages to craft a fresh, urban, fantasy, supernatural storyline.

And what makes it so fun is how certain scenes of different characters and storylines are interconnected.

You get the high school student element with characters like Mikado, Masaomi and Narita. Then you get the supernatural/action-based sequences typically with Celty, Izaya and Shizuo. But then you get this fantasy element with Celty who is a Dulahan from Ireland in search of her head. And as these characters are quite interesting, you throw in other characters such as Masaomi's buddies, the Black Russian Simon and all these other mysterious characters that everything together leads to a fun time. These characters are interesting and each storyline has been well-written and planned.

And as the characters are a big part of ""Durarara!!"", also is the city of Ikebukuro in Tokyo. How the city is featured in this anime series is fantastic! Every scene is new and showcasing areas from the city with so much detail, color and for the most part, the character and art design for this series is one of the best I have seen.

And with ""Durarara!! Part 02', the story continues to get even better as this volume can be called the revelation of Mikado, Masaomi and Anri.  For the last nine episodes, we were led to believe that these three high school students were just normal teenagers but each of these three individuals have a secret.  Suffice to say, if you have never seen the series before, these revelations will shock you.  And it's probably best as I leave it to that without spoiling the series.

As for the other characters, We get to know more about Celty Surluson and despite her being a kick-ass character, we also get to know that she has a side to her that one would not expect.  Also, it's quite interesting to see her relationship with Shinra Kishitani develop.

But things are starting to heat up for this series and for the three high school friends, you just wonder if they will manage to become friends if they discover each others secrets.  So, I look forward to the next volume of ""Durarara!!"".

I've mentioned last fall of how I felt ""East of Eden"" and ""Ghost Hound"" were one of the best anime TV series I have seen and now I have to add Studio Base's ""Durarara!!"" to that list. The only difference is that the other two have been released via HD on Blu-ray and for an anime series that looks this spectacular, one can only hope that Aniplex does consider this series for Blu-ray release in the near future.

As for the DVD release, once again, the English dub for ""Durarara!!"" is awesome and very well-done. I was enjoying the Japanese soundtrack but after watching the English dub track, everything fits and each voice actor that was cast is perfect for the role they play. So, another wonderful job by Bang Zoom!

But with the high of the animation and the overall series, the only low-point is the lack of special features. It would have been nice to have audio commentary from the voice talent (Japanese or English). For this second part, you do get the music videos by Theatre Brook and Yuya Matsushita.

It would also have been nice to see Bang Zoom giving the English dub soundtrack a 5.1 Dolby Digital treatment than Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo. But for those that own receivers capable of selecting stereo on all channels, that is probably the best selection to have more of an immersive soundtrack.

But Aniplex does make things up with a pretty awesome digipack case with plastic slipcover and five postcards featuring artwork of the various characters of ""Durarara!!"".

Overall, this series is fantastic! It's one of the best looking, stylish anime TV series ever created. I'm always down for an Urban street culture type of anime series and ""Durarara!!"" was just fantastic, fresh and fun! I enjoyed this anime series immensely and I can't wait for part 3.

Highly recommended!",1302652800,7,13796,4.70975813177648
