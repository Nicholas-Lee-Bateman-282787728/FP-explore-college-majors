281302,4,630026260X,"While the average movie watcher may not recognize the name Betsy Russell (Private School, Cheerleader Camp), those of us males who grew up in the 1980s, weaned on hours of dedicated cable viewing, know her as something akin to a goddess in the world of dumb, teen comedies for basically two reasons...she was one fine babe, and she didn't seem to mind showing some skinage, as evident in the film Tomboy (1985), among others.  Originally released by Crown International Pictures, the film was directed by Herb Freed (Graduation Day, Survival Game) and stars, as I mentioned, Ms. Russell.  Also appearing is Gerard Christopher (""Superboy""), Kristi Somers (Hardbodies), Richard Erdman (The Blue Gardenia), and the late Eric Douglas (The Flamingo Kid), youngest son of actor Kirk Douglas.

Russell plays Tomasina `Tommy' Boyd, a tomboy through and through who spends her days working on cars, shooting hoops with the boys, and riding her motorcycle.  After a fairly schmaltzy and pointless opening sequence showing Tommy as a girl, playing baseball with the boys, scoring a run, and ultimately hugging her father (who was apparently an astronaut in the air force), all done in slow motion montage form, we're now in the present as Tommy rises from bed and proceeds to shower...some skin but no goodies...yet...man, you wouldn't think you could be jealous of a sponge...anyway, Tommy works as a mechanic at Chester's Garage, a dumpy filling station where she's often visited by her girly girl friend Seville (Somers), an aspiring Broadway dancer who seems to have little problem sleazing her way up the ladder of success, as evident later on in the film.  After witnessing a dance audition by Seville and her troupe, one performed for some potential financial backers (surprisingly enough they declined on investing in Seville and her rotten routine), we're back in the garage as big time stock car driver/professional pretty boy Randy Starr (Christopher), who Tommy's got a serious crush on...seems Randy has been hired by a local rich and infinitely sleazy dink named Ernie Leeds, Jr. to race for him, and Randy offers Tommy an invitation to come to Leeds' house to check out his boss stock car.  After this we see Seville auditioning for a donut commercial, whoring it up good, followed by Tommy and Seville heading to Leeds' house where Tommy and Randy race around on motocross bikes (at one point Tommy crashes in a swampy morass, resulting in her revealing her Tommy `guns, if only to get out of her wet clothes...hootchie mama!).  Following this there's a party sequence at Leeds' house (with parachute pants as far as the eye can see), Tommy and Randy hook up, as evident with an overly long montage sequence featuring the pair engaging in all sorts of outdoor activities, but eventually they have a falling out as Tommy shows Randy up on the race track while an important sponsor is in attendance, the result being the pair deciding to race each other to settle once and for all who the best driver is...

While the Tomboy is pure 1980s teenage hokum through and through, it fairs better than its counterparts based solely on the presence of Betsy Russell and her generous `assets', along with her willingness to put them on display.  The movie itself actually played like one, long series of Mentos commercials.  One example of this is early on as Tommy is riding her motorcycle to work and she stops off to engage in a game of basketball with some local chumps.  Through a bit of creative editing Russell makes all of her shots, but then here's the kicker...as she's leaving, she climbs aboard her motorcycle and one of the dudes tosses her the ball.  She catches it with one hand, puts it up, and swoosh!  It goes in...as she drives off the yahoos begin high fivin' each other, apparently overjoyed in the fact they've just been emasculated by losing to a girl in their own sport.  I did learn a lot of things from this film, including the following...

1. I'd give my left gonasticle to be Betsy Russell's loofa.

2. Pretentious, forgettable pop songs from the 1980s, often featured in films like this, generally included meaningless lyrics like `You got the magic, I got the fire'.

3. Nothing gets women hotter than chasing them around town in your muscle car, throwing a constant barrage of catcalls in their direction.

4. When a sign warns of `severe tire damage', they ain't kidding.

5. Untalented bimbos could manage to find success given their willingness to whore it up.

6. Someone other than Jimmy `J.J.' Walker actually used the phrase `Dy-no-mite!' in the 1980s.

7. When doing a television commercial for donuts the performers actually get paid in donuts.

8. Goofy, slow motion montages are a great way to pad out a film.

9. When waiting for a woman to meet you for a date it's probably not a good idea to let her walk in on you while you're watching porn as she'll think you're some kind of skeevy perv.

10. Apparently, in the world of stock car racing, slapping a jet engine onto your vehicle isn't considered an illegal modification.

The performances were passable for a movie like this (although the idea of Betsy Russell as a tomboy seemed a bit farfetched), but the writing is pretty lousy (this one's about as predictable as they come).  I seriously doubt anyone was sitting on the edge of their seat at the end of this one, wondering if plucky Tommy would beat arrogant Randy in the race, thus validating Tommy's belief a woman can do anything as well as a man.  I do love these kinds of films, though, as they take on the superficial mask of female empowerment while passing along copious amounts of nekkid female flesh (Russell's character was the only female that came off remotely decent here).  I did gag a little on some of the schmaltz-laden montages but overall, I'd say this was an entertaining, three star (out of five) feature, and an extra star thrown in for Ms. Russell.

The picture quality on this BCI DVD release, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), looks pretty decent, and the Dolby Digital stereo audio comes through well enough.  There aren't any extras, except for a few trailers for some other BCI DVD releases in their Crown International Classics (I wouldn't necessarily refer to some many of them as `classics') series including Hunk (1987), The Beach Girls (1982), Jocks (1987), and My Chauffer (1986).

281304,5,630026260X,"This is one of my favorite cheesy movies from the 1980's. I was thrilled when it finally came to dvd. I remember seeing this years ago, as a kid and thought it was fun. I miss Betsy Russell, I have several of her movies from the 80's and thought she always did great in whatever movie she was in.",1163030400,6,296,4.033898305084746
281305,2,630026260X,"Crown International Pictures & Marimark Productions cranked out some of the worst films of the '80's (e.g. My Tutor). This one is a little better than My Tutor. The acting is pretty good overall, but Betsy Russell's character, Tommy, is so uncompromising at times that it's hard to root for her (e.g. the open end of the film in which she replies ""Maybe"" when asked if she'll go back to dating Ernie).
Like how the film didn't make her out to be a trashy hussy that sleeps with every guy - but quite the opposite - a sexually inexperienced human being that is intimidated by guys on an intimate level.
Could've done without the many instances of misogyny in which Ernie's assistant, Junior calls women ""stupid beeyatches"" & ""broads"" to their faces & they stumble out of his car, bare breasted, their clothes around their waists as he & Ernie climb out of the car, fully clothed. Also, didn't like how he basically prostituted the women at parties at Ernie's mansion by instructing them to sleep with the elderly male guests (Yuck!)The soundtrack, as in most B movies, is pure torture.
Richard Erdman is endearing & adorable as Tommy's boss & he helps make the film a little more tolerable. So does Tommy's friend, Seville Ritz. Btw, what ever happened to her cute subplot in which she was trying to find financial backers for her own TV pilot? They never wrapped that up!

281526,3,630026260X,"Tomboy is just another entry in a sea of indistinguishable 1980's T&A films. Bad music,bad clothes,bad hair,bad acting and lots of boobs are the requirements for 80's teen sex films and Tomboys got em all.

There is something like-able about Betsy Russell but her acting in Tomboy is just awful. She is totally stiff,and her lines are delivered with no emotion and are often delivered too early or too late and don't feel natural at all. Seems like she is just repeating memorized lines like someone who's just starting acting school. There are a few cringe worthy scenes where she has no lines but has to act like she's laughing hysterically and its so fake that its painful to watch. She also emits some bizarre noises when she laughs.

The race at the end is so bad,it looks like they are going about 40 mph and the cars that i guess where supposed to look bad-ass look like awful kit cars that were made in Mexico and are about to fall apart.

Dumb movie with enough boob scenes to get you through 90 min but one viewing is enough. Movie 2/5 boobs 4/5 overall 3/5",1342569600,4,1067,4.461538461538462
281527,3,630026260X,"This has to be one of the cheesiest 1980's movies ever made.  Everyone is so clean cut and when they act ""wild"" they aren't really doing anything that exciting.  Released in 1985, right in the middle of the conservative Reagan years, this movie is a low budget affair that is nothing special at all. Its just a movie.  The best thing about it is Betsy Russell who is always hot and she looks great in her short cutoff shorts.  Her friend in the movie has a very hot body too but she is not too attractive in the face at all.  Still, Betsy has a better body than her but she is the star of the movie so that is to be expected.  The movie is about a young girl who is an auto mechanic and tomboy who wants to prove that she can do everything just as well as a guy can.  She's tough and, at first, doesn't seem to have a romantic side to her at all.  She meets a race car driver who she eventually falls head over heels over and when he makes a comment that she cannot drive a racecar as well as he can then she sets out to prove him wrong.  The movie is very predictable.  You probably can already guess the ending by reading this keeping in mind the typical plot format of American movies from the Eighties.  For a comedy, its not really funny at all.  Its just best for watching Betsy Russell look good.  If you are looking for a good plot, then go elsewhere.",1340928000,,1359,4.083018867924529

She is also a grease monkey minus any grease or dirt and always has a nice clean manicure as most auto-mechanics and welders. She was a wild friend Seville (Kristi Somers) who will do anything to endear herself to the motion picture industry.  Tommy idolizes local race driver Randy Starr (Gerard Christopher) but wants his respect too which she can gain by racing cars.

On the surface, this is a lousy film. Betsy Russell gets an ""F"" attempting to play a mechanic. This film is available in at least two different 50 DVD collections of ""B"" movies and '80's films. What makes this film a hit is the classic 80's nude scenes provided by both Betsy Russell and Kristi Somers. If not for Phobe Cates, this would certainly be some of the best of 80's boy fantasy.

4 stars for the nudity.
