  ""It's not a bad quesiton Bert.""
  ""I'll be there with bells on.""
  ""I bust my a** for you guys and what do I get?  Eh, you're spooky.  What do you think, this is a f***ing costume?  This is a way of life!""
  ""Rabid weasels?""  ""Well thats what I'm trying to tell you here, Ernie.""

378907,5,6301932420,"Personally I like this one the best of all. Its more nostalgic to me and the only one that sincerly as a child and now as an adult, still freaks me out. That creepy music that plays thru out is what does it. I do laugh at a couple parts tho..  the dead, really decayed all black soaked in tar zombie, when it pops out yelling ""BRAINS!!!"" , think its the creepy happy ish smile it gives. LOL
Great semi cheesy film, but overall pretty disturbing by some scenes.. like the very beginning part... and also how the zombies come out..",1514937600,,529,4.237623762376238

379167,4,6301932420,"This is by far my favorite movie of all time, and all the bonus features make this release a definite ""must have"", but something I was surprised by was that it's a different cut! From what I know of the theatrical release, it looks like it was restored off a reel from a theater, or  re-cut to closer resemble it (one of Tarman's lines has the voice past releases have used instead of the ""squeaky"" voice that can be heard in the end credits). There's some good points to this new cut (some footage that was taken out in past releases is back, the image is beautiful, and the audio sounds a bit more clear), but if you don't already own a copy (I have a few, like I said, total fave flick here) and want the version you're more used to, I suggest getting the other collector's edition that was released a few years ago. For all the neat bonus stuff and the absolutely wonderful art on the sleeve and cover (the cover is reversible by the way! The other side has the original ""they're back from the grave, and ready to party"" art).",1481846400,,1030,4.282051282051282
379168,5,6301932420,This is probably one of my favorite zombie movies! Please Amazon make a digital edition! I'm lazy and want to flip from one to the other (while playing video games on the other tv)!,1481846400,,181,4.352941176470588

379170,4,6301932420,"It's been many many years since I saw this movie. I'll start by saying the remastered version looks amazing.  Considering what year this originally came out, watching this looked like the movie was made in the last 10 years or so. It looks great.
Now on to the movie itself.... ehhh I really forgot how horrible of a movie it is. It's fun. It's just.... not that great haha. If you're really nostalgic for this movie you will love it. If you are totally new, I would probably pass. I rated it 4 stars for the fact that it looks great and they definitely put a lot of time into making a great all around package.",1481587200,,611,4.267241379310345

379209,5,6301932420,"So many extras on here ! Has the entire work print, interviews and plenty of commentaries. The only bad thing is some audio ""fixes"" here and there. They totally took out the track when the punks are riding around town, and ""Take a walk"" is totally overpowering the dialogue in the scene just after the punks encounter Tarman. Other than that- this is the greatest release ive seen by Shout factory. Love it",1479686400,,406,4.575342465753424
379210,3,6301932420,"Freddy just got a new job working at a medical supply warehouse. While his boss Frank shows him around, they look at the military drums full of the remains of a failed experiment. Frank kicks a drum to show how solid it is, but it springs a leak, spewing a mystery substance everywhere including all over Freddy and Frank. Frank wants to try to cover it up so he won't get in trouble or lose his job and they keep arguing back and forth until it becomes clear that all the cadavers come alive. They try to incinerate one of the living corpses after conventional means doesn't destroy it, but they just spread the substance to a nearby cemetery. Now a huge horde of zombies is roaming the city,  eating anyone that crosses their path.

This film is a kind of sequel to Night of the Living Dead. Return of the Living Dead acknowledges the existence of the previous film, but claims facts had to be changed so the government wouldn't block its production. Zombies reanimate because of toxic gas from a failed military experiment. They can speak when fed and have the ability to run. Each zombie feels unimaginable pain that is only sated temporarily by brains. Destroying their brain or any other part of their body doesn't destroy them. Only incineration is effective, but the smoke contains the gas that will animate even more dead. I don't mind the new zombie rules, but I do mind practically indestructible zombies with no real solution.

I only just found out that there are two series of film that offshoot from Night of the Living Dead. One is George A. Romero's ""of the Dead"" series that are much more serious and keep consistent with the rules of the original film. The other series is John A. Russo's ""of the Living Dead"" and follows these new rules. It's much more comedic and zany with over the top characters. Besides the two warehouse workers, the film follows a group of teenage punks who curse constantly, rage against their boring lives, and strip naked to dance in cemeteries. These characters are the type you want to see eaten by zombies because of how annoying they are. I felt no sympathy for them at all.

Return of the Living Dead is a fun ride with a different type of zombie, a lighter tone, and shallower characters than the original film it's based on, Night of the Living Dead. I much prefer Romero's films and the more serious tone with his spot on societal commentary. This film is fun and much different than most zombie films. The effects are usually pretty impressive with some moments of obvious badness. I enjoyed the film even with its flaws and I wouldn't mind seeing the next one in the series.",1478822400,,2630,4.5774946921443735

I switched from 5.1 to the original 2.0. All of the same music that I remember from the 1985 release. The only real difference is that ""Tarman's"" voice changed. When he first speaks he had the higher sounding voice. However his voice switches to deeper as time goes on.

Other than that all of the music tracks are available in the original 2.0 sound.

The visual quality is good and crisp and clear. It's a good purchase for fans of the series.",1469750400,3,598,4.36936936936937

379386,5,6301932420,I was a little skeptical about purchasing this collectors edition based on the stories that I read on here about previous releases of this film that had been altered from the original theatrical print but I have to say I'm glad I bought it as Scream Factory did a great job with this transfer. First off I can tell you now that majority of the original soundtrack is back in the film except one song which is the Damned Dead beat dance also Tarman has his voice back as well. One thing that bugged me in the beginning when I first viewed the movie is that in some scenes the music is playing in parts where it shouldn't be and you can't hear the dialogue and when the one zombie says send more cops it's a different voice then the original movie so that bummed me out until I went to the set up menu on the disc and saw two other audio channels you can use and those two audio channels restore the original audio track from the movie and the music is back where it should be and the Zombie saying send more cops voice is from the original film so I was happy when I found this out and tried it. The extras on disc 2 are great giving you a full documentary on the making of the film with all the original actors and actresses as well as a workprint of the original film that's not to watchable due to quality but I appreciate the thought of including it so to sum it up if you haven't bought this collection yet buy it you'll enjoy it big time.,1469577600,9,1443,4.120567375886525

My only complaint is sometimes the music covered up the dialogue in a couple places. It has a ton of extras that are a lot of fun to watch. This really is a great release of the film.

This is a genuinely great movie that is done very well. All the characters within 30 minutes are introduced and each one has their own personality and feel to them without ever being just generic. The pacing is amazing as the movie from the very start gets moving forward at a great pace without ever leaving you feeling like you're being rushed, or that something important is missing, it is very tight in its pacing. The directing and shots in the movies are also just right with a lot of interesting viewpoints and angles. The music is also very fitting and perfect for each scene. Its genuinely creepy and also has a great sense of dark humor that it goes back and fourth between and a lot of times blends together. The humor itself is perfect because it fits the film and never feels dumbed down, lazy or just generic. And I must say this movie sets the stage better than any other movie, once the title screen and opening credits come up you have a perfect understanding of everything you need to know. All in all its just a perfectly done movie to me that couldn't be better by adding to it or taking away from it.",1469404800,3,1592,4.36026936026936
379390,4,6301932420,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE NEW 2 DISC SCREAM FACTORY RELEASE ON BLU-RAY
I am going to start this review by telling you all this has been my favorite horror film since it came out on VHS and Laserdisc. If you already aren't aware, the music in the film originally released has been changed and altered since those releases, as well as zombie voices. Unfortunately, this release though going back to SOME of the original film elements, it did not complete the job. The films music stands altered, and sequences of music are missing. The zombie voices, you get ""come in dispatch, send more paramedics"" restored to original sound, but the ""send more cops"" stands altered. Tarman has been retored, all his original voices are there. There is a fanedit I obtained years back that has the sound from the HBO/Image laserdisc release dubbed over the first MGM DVD image. It remains my favorite way to watch the film. Now as far as EXTRA'S, this release is unmatched. The level of attention paid to the extra's makes the release worth the purchase alone. There are TONS. Visually stunning of course, and seeing this 1984 made horror classic join the ranks of Hi-def 2k excellence is warranting of huge thanks to Scream Factory for doing this release. It's really, really too bad no studio can imagine releasing the film unaltered, but who knows what the future holds.",1469318400,26,1353,4.737288135593221

379430,5,6301932420,"Ordered direct from Scream/Shout Factory, and got the disc a lil' early.  :)
First of all, the new artwork is great. Comissioned especially for this release, reminds me of old school movie posters. Like with many of Scream Factory releases, this does feature an alternate cover.
In terms of picture quality, the movie looks great. Where the release really shines though, is the EXTRAS.  There was so much stuff, this release is a two disc set. Some of my favorite ones are: new audio commentary  that included Thom Matthews, zombie subtitles (yes, i said ""zombie subtitles""), a feature on the special effects, and even one on movie locations(always fun to see what's changed or stayed the same), and the previously released ""More Brains"" documentary.  The workprint of the movie is also among the included extras! It is in pretty bad/rough shape (as in 'worse than bad VHS' shape), but this was unavoidable, as a better print could not be located. The only real issue that fans would have with this release is one missing song in the soundtrack (""Dead Beat Dance""), which was apparently due to licensing issues.  :(
Overall, this is the best US/Region A release of the movie available (the other being the UK Bluray released by Second Sight Films), so I'd definitely recommend it!",1467849600,14,1280,4.880184331797235

I had read on the Shout Factory's forum about whether or not if the original soundtrack will be put back into the film.  Here is what Shout has stated:  ""For our new transfer we have gone back to the original audio tracks to create a new soundtrack. Only one song - The Damneds Dead Beat Dance - could not be cleared for inclusion on the disc unfortunately. Otherwise, the rest will be the original audio as heard in the theaters when the film played first-run.""
 ...So, there you guys go.  The Damned either said no or wanted too much money...damn them! lol.

Both the video and audio on this set is at it's best!  The workprint is very rough but watchable.  Great extras as well!  I hope they do a special edition for part 2!",1463184000,77,3341,5.084403669724771

379488,4,6301932420,"The Return of the Living Dead has been labeled by many as the best (zombie) horror comedy of all-time, so of course I had high expectations. I ended up really liking this movie, but I wasn't exactly crazy about it like some are. Ill start off with the positives. Its a fun watch with loads of clever humor that made me laugh instantly. The acting performances are good, but I was especially impressed by Thom Mathews, Beverly Randolph, Linnea Quigley (gained so much respect for her and I cant wait to see her in more horror pictures!) and Miguel Nez. The characters are interesting, but some are better developed than others. The soundtrack is fantastic and suits perfectly with the theme of the movie. The zombies looked absolutely outstanding and Tarman has to be the scariest and funniest looking zombie creature youll ever see. At first sight he looks scary as hell, but his actions feel comical because you won't take it seriously. The Return of the Living Dead is much more a spoof/comedy than a straightforward horror/comedy. The script and dialogue are super 80s and I must add that this movie had a strong first act. Having that said, there are some negative aspects that need to be mentioned.

The second act of the movie is extremely slow and messes up the strong pace from the first act. Scenes that drag on for long to the point where it feels repetitive. The ending is stupid and feels rushed. Its a shame when you only know about the fates of the zombies and not about what happened to the main characters you were rooting for to survive. Such a weird note to end a movie with. The story got wrapped up in the most ridiculous way. The Return of the Living Dead is still a hilarious and at times thrilling (zombie) horror/comedy from the mid 80s with many redeeming qualities. Its far from perfect, but its definitely one you have to see at least once in your life. Im more than interested in viewing the first two sequels after having seen the original for the first time.

379516,5,6301932420,"It is time to do one of my personal favorite movies ever. I saw this when it played on H.B.O. in 1985, and I've owned it in every format since then. It never gets old, and it has my favorite zombie resurrection scene of all time. But first, some back story.
George Romero had help in writing Night of the Living Dead, and that help was John Russo. When they split after that film, Russo retained the rights to the phrase Living Dead, and George was free to make his own sequels, starting with Dawn of the Living Dead. Originally Tobe Hooper was set to direct, but he backed out on account of a vicious case of Space Vampires, and Dan O'Bannon was brought in to direct. (He also wrote the script about those nasty Space Vampires, so there might be a conspiracy in there somewhere.) O'Bannon had one request, and that was the ability to re-write the script so that it differed from Romeros scripts. This is how we ended up with one of the funniest horror movies ever.
The plot isn't hard to follow. Freddy(Thom Mathews) is learning about his new job, at a medical supply warehouse, and after his boss Frank (James Karen) tells him about the strangest thing he's ever witnessed at the job, the two make their way downstairs so Burt can show him a Army container that Burt swears is the cause of the zombies in Night of the Living Dead.
Meanwhile, Freddies girlfriend and friends (which represent every parody of the 80's possible) have decided to hang out in the cemetery to wait for Freddy to get off of work. This involves lots of awesome 80's music, and a famous naked crypt dance from Linnea Quigley. I have to stop, or I will sit and tell you guys the entire plot. I'm quoting along with it as I'm watching it. If I didn't mention it before, I love this movie immensely.
On to some important aspects. This is the first movie to specifically have the zombies eat brains instead of flesh. You even get a full explanation of why they crave brains. This is one of the only movies where destroying the zombies brain doesn't kill the zombie, which leads to what I call the dance of the headless, naked zombie. This is among a handful of movies that utilizes this much humor without sacrificing any of the horror. You will be laughing and cringing at the same time. Once the rain starts to fall, you will be in awe.
Scare Factor 6/10 While it is definitely not a weak movie, it's too much fun to really terrify anyone. However, the zombie makeup is top notch, and as I said earlier, this is my all-time favorite resurrection scene of all time. You will jump at certain scenes, but you'll be laughing much more.
Gore 5/10 There isn't a lot of blood in the movie, but there are a lot of zombies in various stages of decomposition. Nothing too graphic, but it's still impressive to see the talents of make up artists before the days of CGI.
Acting 10/10 Here is how entertaining this cast is, it is 45 minutes before the first zombie crawls it's way out of the ground, and it feels like nothing. James Karen especially is brilliant and hysterical in dealing with the situation, but there isn't a bad performance in the film.
Recommended 10/10 Aside from being perfect, this film also has the most realistic ending in a 80's zombie movie. I'll spoil nothing, but I guarantee that you'll be completely shocked, while agreeing that it makes perfect sense at the same time.

I heard it became a cult classic like night of the living dead, but I  was disappointed that the fact that all of the characters died, other than that I thought it was really good, I even have a poster from this movie along with the sequel Return of the Living Dead Part 2 which I thought was even better. I also like the fact that the zombies went after brains instead of just flesh and other body parts. Other than I give it a 9/10 good movie !

scream factory didn't even try to give it new Digital remaster very poor VHS transfer
not worth watching really
the MORE BRAINS -RETURN TO THE LIVING DEAD 2hr DOCUMENTARY from 2011

Aligned with their boss Burt (Clu Gulager) the group tries to get a handle on thing by enlisting the help of Burts old friend and local embalmer Ernie (Don Calfa) by using his crematorium to dispose of the still animated but dismembered body parts. Unfortunately this plan of action comes to spell doom for a group of Freddy punk buddies who are in the midst of partying it out at the next-door graveyard, waiting for Freddy to get off of work. What transpires next sets off a chain of unforeseeable events which could very well lead to the end of civilisation as we know it!
Will this rowdy band of misfits be able to fend off the ever-growing army of positively famished corpses long enough to secure an escape route or are they destined to be gobbled up in the rain-soaked streets admits the tormented and hungry cries for brains?...It's not a bad question Burt

A testament to what a great horror-comedy ought to be, combining a smart antiauthoritarian script, great lively cast, fantastic SFX and kickass music to insure that a gory-fying good time is had by all.
Loyal readers of my reviews (all 3 of you) will undoubtedly know by now that Im not the biggest advocate of comedy in the horror genre, mostly due to the fact that its such a balancing act getting the respective genres to mesh without undermining one or the other, some notable exceptions include films like Re-Animator (Stuart Gordon, 1985) Evil Dead 2 (Sam Raimi, 1987) and Dead Alive (Braindead, Peter Jackson, 1992) whom due to their loopy anarchistic antics and balls-out entertainment value had yours truly hooked from start to finish and The Return of the Living Dead certainly belongs in the stellar company of the aforementioned titles giving its credentials as an unapologetic good time, rarely opting for anything less than the most reckless of abandonment in regards to the narrative.
Breaking the zombie mould established by George A. Romero, the flesh-eaters presented here are of the sprinter variety that weve come to be so familiar with in the 21th century, they seem to be primarily interested in devouring brains, an idiom the horde howls endlessly ( which every comedian or sit-com/comedic show on earth seem to paraphrase whenever the zombie is alluded to, perfectly illustrating that the film is a comedic power house to be reckoned with as well as an pop cultural icon) Hell the undead even speak coherently; something that normally would constitute big no-no in my book, but the film has such a perfectly balanced facetious tone (the catalyst of the film is that Romeros 1968 Night of the Living Dead is real, after all) that it somehow works perfectly in the confines of this particular story, Id even go as far as to dispute that none of these tongue in cheek mannerisms has ever been employed with the kind of skill and dedication on show here, which should be seen as a true testament to the filmmakers understanding of the material and its possibilities and even the most zealous zombie fanatic would have a hard time arguing otherwise... But with all that being said I still have to admit that the moment where one of the rotting brain-munches picks up an ambulance radio and demands that despatch should Send more paramedics... still makes me cringe albeit subtlety.

The comedic elements are for the most part night time black which adds beautifully to the offbeat nature of the first 2/3s of the film.
Luckily by the time the third act rolls around the film turns to doom n gloom and the intensity of these climatic scenes ensure that the film ends on a hell of a creepy and beautiful nihilistic high note.

OBannons script is an energetic power house and brimming with eminently quotable dialog which the actors fortunately seem to revel in. The comedic timing and delivery of actors Clu Gulager, James Karen, Thom Mathews and Don Calfa are positively off the page as they chew the scenery. Their respective delivering of wide-eyed fear and ever escalating sense of panic and despair as things gets increasingly grim is simply a laugh riot.
So while the aforementioned quartet are obviously on top of the game here, the rest of the cast won't raise much complaints either, in the roles of the various punks they do exactly what they're suppose to and furthermore die accordantly.
An additional bonus is without a doubt the spectacle of watching Z-grade scream queen Linnea Quigley in her hard bodied prime delivering an absolutely mouth-watering striptease on top a gravesite (this bit was the most scratched and used up bit of my old VHS tape...You do the math) and then spends the rest of the film running around in her tight and completely flawlessly looking birthday suite or in laymans terms buck naked. Thank you so much Mr. OBannon!!!

You cant talk about The Return of the Living Dead without alluding to its awesome soundtrack layered with the music of the punk heavyweights of yesteryear such as 45 Grave, The Cramps and The Damned.
Normally I don't like a pervasive use of song based music in horror film but in the spirit of The Return of the Living Dead rebellious nature it somehow works perfectly and is as refreshing to watch/listen to today as it was back then.

With all that being said, The Return of the Living Dead isn't a perfect film, you wound learn anything new and you certainly won't be a better person for watching it. But if you want a balls-out horror comedy that plays by its own rules and sticks by them throughout, than you won't get a better film than this.
Do you wanna party...You bet your f::::g ass!

DVD:
First and foremost this limited edition steelbook release of The Return of the living Dead from Second Sight Films is without a doubt one of the best home video releases of the year and heres why.
The main feature is held in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and while the high definition transfer isn't exactly mind-blowing its still a noticeable improvement over previous DVD releases. The various audio mixes are also well balanced, handling the frantic nature of the piece very well.
The Pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance of this release however is the absurd amount of special features on hand. As the main attraction, we have the entire two-hour retrospective documentary More Brains: A Return to the Living Dead, which is absolutely packed with juicy behind the scenes anecdotes, on-set footage, storyboards, various conceptual stuff, it basically covers the entire history of the film from idea to screen and is an absolute treasure chest of information and a must see for any fan of the film. Next up is a documentary which delve into the next two sequels and offers interviews with filmmakers involved, deleted interviews that didn't make it into the final cut, a modern day revisit to some of the shooting locations, and a montage of the principal actors reciting their most iconic lines in Return of the Living Dead in Three Minutes. You also get a rather honest interview with director Dan OBannon, recorded shortly before he passed away.
Other extras include a discussion about the soundtrack with music consultant Steve Pross and 45 Graves Dinah Cancer. And a featurette about the special effects where production designer William Stout and the special effects guys involved go into further detail on the zombie designs and practical make-up effects.
Also included in the steelbook is Ernies Notepad, a replica notebook that contains a wealth of information about the film.
A quick word of warning to readers who cant play region B Blu-Rays youll need a multi-region player to view this as the disc is sadly Region B locked.",1435449600,,7950,4.841911764705882

GREAT soundtrack, GREAT make-up/zombie effects, awesome story, hilarious, creepy, and just an all-around damn good movie. HOWEVER, this review is for the latest version (Blu-Ray), which as all the negative reviews have stated, is garbage. The reasons being: It has a fake ""widescreen"" added to it (the original was shot FOR TELEVISION so any version with black bars on top/bottom are fake and put it to make it look ""widescreen."" You can tell if you put in the two versions and compare them, you can see where they added the fake widescreen which clearly cuts out parts of the film you can see in the fullscreen version. Again, the reason being it was ORIGINALLY SHOT FOR TELEVISION IN THE '80s so the original intent and version are FULLSCREEN. Fullscreen is the origial aspect ratio. Believe me, I'm a stickler for the original versions and I LOATHE fullscreen when there's true widescreen available. Also, they re-mixed music, sound effects and voices for some reason. Perhaps they couldn't secure the music rights, which I can understand, but they screwed with the audio/voices and sound effects. Now some of the zombies that speak sound idiotic and goofy instead of frightening. Don't waste your money with this version if you already have the movie in any other form (VHS or FULLSCREEN dvd or Laserdisc).",1420502400,8,1419,4.916666666666667

379806,5,6301932420,"I'm not addressing the issues that others had with their copies, redone soundtracks, etc. since 1) I never saw the movie in the theater and 2) the DVD version I have doesn't have any problems that I can see.

As an author, avid reader, and film buff I read a lot of books and see a lot of movies that are just crap. I always ask myself WHY did they ever do this? I know creators of material can get blinders on about their work and maybe they are happy with the results but on much of the material being released today I think to myself, ""someone should have been honest with you about this when they read it for you"".

However, every now and then I come across one and I think to myself ""I wish this was mine"". One example is The Shawshank Redemption. The short story (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King) was phenomenal  and then the movie was just as good if not better.

This movie is not The Shawshank Redemption, but you can tell that by the cover and the title.

Instead, it is the most original take on zombies since the original Night of the Living Dead. It is scary, funny, and just absolutely incredible. I wish I had written, directed, or in any other way made this movie.

This is the first time I saw the zombies craving brains rather than just flesh. I can't say for sure that it started the ""brains"" idea but I can say it does it better and even offers a credible (or at least as credible as you can have in a zombie movie) reason for the zombies hunger.

The acting is, at times, over the top but in a good way. The performances by Clu Galager (you may remember him from a zillion movies, Project Greenlight, and Feast) and the rest of the cast is excellent but I want to give a special shout out to two of the actors.

The first is Linnea Quigley, who plays ""Trash"", and is the gorgeous scream queen you may remember for her scene in 1988's Night of the Demons where she distracts the store clerk by bending over in a short skirt while her friend(s) steal stuff for a party. She also reprised the role, but used the same type costume, for the 2011 ""remake"". Linnea is the ultimate scream queen and 'm sure her graveyard striptease and dance got the hormones flowing for many a young horror buff.

The second is James Karen. Most people won't recognize his name but will instantly recognize his face. His performance as Frank elevated the movie from great to ""abso-f**kinglutely fantastic"".

The special effects are masterful with the zombies ranging from ""barely held together squishy"" to freshly dead to almost nothing left. The scene of the zombie on the table in the mortuary explaining why she wants brains is still one of the best special effects scenes ever done and since this was in the days pre-CGI it is unlikely to ever be topped. When you watch the movie keep an eye out of the zombie spine while she is speaking.

Despite its campy humor the movies is still scary at times, particularly when you think about ""what if..."". The ending is one of the best endings I have ever seen on a horror movie, providing a resolution for the characters but still leaving the bigger question out there.

This is a movie that I whole heartedly endorse. It is probably my favorite zombie movie after Night of the Living Dead and it is at least tied with Shaun of the Dead in the Zomedy genre.",1414627200,,3328,4.376012965964343

379840,5,6301932420,"Supposedly old friends of my family's know Don Calfa personally, haven't met him myself,
however, I am a huge fan of his, esp. from the classic comedy thriller Foul Play, somehow as huge an 80s
guy and fan as I was/am, I never paid much attention to this in '85 (cause I confess,
I kind of wrote it off, from the trailers, as some piece of utter schlocko horror when in fact it's a satire/spoof thereof, at least,
and a loving one at that) even though I'm a Horror Fanatic and Dan O'Bannon fanatic mainly due to Dark Star and
ALIEN.  Plus, I was also probably too busy recovering from the disappointment of realizing that DUNE,
as much as I wanted to love it, had just let almost everyone down.  Instead friends dragged me to see
utter nonsense like Revenge of the Nerds, instead.  The guilty parties know who they are, and no,
you don't have any taste now, and didn't then.  No brain, no effect.

In any case, I screened this tonight (the DVD not the Blu ray) and wow is it dated, cheezeball,
goofball, and funny as hell and I enjoyed every ridiculous minute.  I still think Repo Man,
for example, holds up a TON better than this, but I still loved this preposterous cheapo
ridiculous film.  Wonderfully, ridiculously bad and awful and good all at the same time!
The soundtrack, though, if it has been bastardized, I dunno why, and that needs to be
rectified, since it's the main thing I recall about the film's premiere and exposure back
in the day on college radio, mainly.  And I'm a huge Cramps and Damned fan, so
I paid attention to THAT if nothing else.  I also love that they are forced to nuke Louisville KY
at the end, ensuring that at least, we won't have to suffer any more Derbys or other
Hunter S. Thompson type insufferable public spectacles like it...at least in this film's
universe of utter corny low-budget cheezedoodle doom.  This is even more dated,
if possible, than your average Blow Monkeys or Musical Youth LP, but still it's great fun.
Eat the brain, aim for the brain, add some Fulci as a nightcap, whatever, it's all good.

""Ahhhhhhh........some more of my favorite brain souppp"" intoneth the late Lux Interior (on the
single version of the song anyway of The Surfin' Dead), we miss you Lux.  There's nothing on the radio when you're dead.....there's nothing playing down at the movies when you're dead.  Watch this, SURF II (if you can
somehow find that wretched waste of 80s celluloid), and KILLER KLOWNS and CLASS OF NUKE 'EM HIGH and the cheese wiz
will be fairly exploding out of your house.  And then screen Abel Ferrara's ghastly bad and highly unpleasant

379843,5,6301932420,"Real events, real names, absolutely true story totally true, or so states the disclaimer at the beginning of this movie.  It is, after all, a comedy concerned with the living dead and their peculiar eating habits.  It all starts when foreman Frank (an inspired James Karen) gives a new employee (Thom Mathews as Freddy), a tour of a medical supply warehouse.  All goes well until they reach the basement and start goofing around a sealed barrel containing the remains of an army experiment gone awry.  One thing leads to another, the barrel is ruptured, toxic gas is released, and everything dead in the place reanimates.  Lunacy and desperation rampage in and around the warehouse, the mortuary next door, and the local cemetery.  The problem remains, how do you kill the dead?
At no time does this movie take itself seriously.  If you are expecting terror and fright, then this is not the movie for you.  Everything is played for laughs.  It's meant to be a fun romp and for the most part, it is.  James Karen easily dominates this movie.  He's the only one who seems to know how to get the most out of the dialog.

As to the theoretical principals of this zombie world, it's by far the bleakest and most cynical you can imagine. These zombies don't go down...you can only burn them to nothing.

tea... My cousin and I would rent this movie over and over again. (alongside

part 2, and our other favorites like Tremors etc...)

We would always laugh at this movie for some reason, it was hillarious to us.

film to this day. Dan O'Bannon is a genious BTW considering all the MASSIVE

contributions he gave to humongous films like TOTAL RECALL and ALIEN.

Here he directed a very funny zombie flick that still has people screaming

knowing where the term BRAINS really originated from.

Having only recently watched Return Of The Living Dead, I can see why this movie has such a following - even in the great abundance of hardcore s***ty zombie movies from the 80s, Return does stand out to me as probably the Ur Example of the ""80s zombie movie"".

This is fairly far from a good movie in general, but you already know that. You want to watch this BECAUSE it's not that good. Every 80s horror movie cliche is in here - generic party punks, inexplicable nudity, excessive foul language, and quite a bit that designed more to shock than anything else. Intelligence is not a goal here, both in execution and in-universe. Everything gets kicked off because the army accidently delivered the doomsday chemical to the wrong place (and no one bothered to correct it), fate was tempted and the apocalypse get's going because of a simple manufacturing flaw. After that, this movie becomes a downhill slope that no one ever recovers from - it just gets worse and worse and worse seemingly by magic. One wonders why they bothered with a chemical agent at all, it could've been supernatural forces at work and almost nothing would have changed for the worse.

At the same time, the real point of a horror movie is to engross you into the fray and make it feel like a genuine nightmare. That this movie did in spades. This is one of the most depressing movies I've watched in recent memory. Not only do you feel bad for the characters for the ridiculous pain they go through, you feel bad for the zombies as well. Unlike a lot of zombie movies, this one really centers on the putrification from life to death. Two characters in the movie breathed the toxic gas by accident and go through hell as their bodies go through rigor mortis and their body temperatures dropping all while being fully conscious, and that really drives up the depression factor. The zombies themselves are dead life - even the most decrepid corpse comes back like they just woke up, and they feel nonstop pain as they rot with almost no hope of ever dying again. There is only one cure for zombification - cremation, and even that comes with a heavy price as every zombie that gets burned up somehow turns into acid rain that pours over everything, immediately granting life to all dead things under the cloud and dooming the living to fully conscious putrification of their own. There is no hope in this movie.

The point of Return of the Living Dead is to make everything on screen suffer, suffer, suffer. This is Romero's zombie apocalypse on crack. If you're the kind of horror fan that jerks off to watching human misery and cares more about the splatter than why it's being splattered, this is your movie. This is not going to be a movie I watch too many times, but I have to admit, for what it is, it did its job quite well.

380049,5,6301932420,"The Return Of The Living Dead is a classic early 80's zombie/horror movie. I remember seeing this movie as a kid in the 80's, around Halloweens. Had to sneek watch it, but I couldn't resist! A group of somewhat diverse-styled teens want a thrill. They decide to all go to an old cemetary to hangout. One of the teens has just started working a new job @ this place that get's & stores all kinds of weird stuff. Among those items, are some barrels. These barrels are property of the government. And actually have bodies in them. Along w/ the bodies there is a mist/chemical. The boss decides to show the teen around the job site. And they start to talking about crazy stuff. Including the barrels, which were part of a government/military experiment to use the dead for war. He then proceeds to show the kid those barrels. The teen questions how safe they are? The boss says they're safe & then gives one a tap. It causes a leak & the mist goes airborne. From there it's all a classic flick! Great story,quircky characters,good actors,some gore,some humor....This DVD is pretty good overall. The DVD & case,ect...is adequate but done very simple. Are there better copies available....Probably. I haven't bought the Blu-ray of it yet.  But this is worth the pick up in my opinion. Especially for a low price.

I remember seeing this movie in the theater when it premiered back in 1985. So it was important to me that it was the original version. After reading some of the previous reviews and disappointments from other kindred fans, I was reluctant to pull the trigger to avoid being disappointed by receiving a hack redux. However, finding it hard to resist a great deal for a great classic, I took a chance and ordered this dvd from the vendor-(Rhys-TerrysPlace). I'm glad I did! I can attest that the dvd I purchased is [nearly] frame for frame, song for song identical to the original 1984/5 release (comparing it to my 1988 HBO vhs copy). It arrived factory sealed. The cover art seems to look consistent with the digital releases being offered today and the original artists/soundtrack is in tact. The point I made; ""[nearly]"" , was meant to infer that there are parts in this dvd version that were originally cut from the first commercial VHS release which leads me to believe that this is a digital version of the actual theatrical release.

380055,4,6301932420,"The Return of the Living Dead has so many hilariously memorable moments it's easy to overlook the overall flaccid timing.  ""Brains!""  Nekkid and quivering Linnea Quigley.  Tarman and 1/2 Lady Corpse.  ""Send more cops!""  While it's not as consistently funny as Young Frankenstein or Monty Python and the Holy Grail, ROTLD seems to have produced almost as many trashy pop culture icons and catch phrases.

The bastard child of John Russo and George Romero, ROTLD thumbs its nose at the serious social commentary of Romero's great zombie flicks and contributes its own indelible marks to zombie canonical lore.  While Romero's tropes included zombies that could be stopped only by destroying the brains, ROTLD introduced the brain eating zeds.  Three decades later we're still quoting Tarman every time we groan ""BRAAAIIINNNSSS!!!"" during Halloween zombie crawls.

And why ""BRAAAIIINNNSSS!!!""?  You'll just have to watch for 1/2 Lady Corpse's explanation.

Where Romero grinds audiences with relentless sardonic nihilism, ROTLD director Dan O'Bannon opts for the ""so bad it's good"" vibe of Plan 9 from Outer Space.  And O'Bannon's veteran cast members invoke that spirit with shameless relish.  Clu Gulager, James Karen and Don Calfa put on a tour de farce of Three Stooges by way of Marx Brothers acting, with the deadpan Gulager keeping things grounded while Karen, as medical supply warehouse manager, cranks the Curly volume to 11 and keeps it there.  Calfa, as Ernie the mortician, plays the Larry Fine foil, all bug-eyed and twitchy.

The original ROTLD isn't even my favorite of the series - ROTLD 3 with the great Melinda Clarke holds that distinction.  But ROTLD set the pace for movies like Shaun of  the Dead that even we way-too-serious zedheads can enjoy laughing at.

It's really only a 3 star movie by most standards but as a lifetime fan of zombie movies, long before the original Night of the Living Dead, I'm always inclined to rate every zombie movie a 5 and deduct points very gently.  ROTLD gets a 4 from me, rather than a 5, mostly because of the occasional flaccid pacing and editing.  Too many scenes feel like O'Bannon didn't really give the actors much to work with, and later failed to tighten up the editing to maintain an appropriately frantic pace.

But overall it's still a fun movie and should be on every zedhead's must-watch list.",1379894400,,2361,4.987212276214834

There is a group of teenage punks that go in a cemetery and start dancing to music. Then it starts raining acid, and the corpses start coming out of the graves.

It's really funny when the zombies go on the phone and say to the police ''send more paramedics'', then the paramedics get there, and the zombies eat them. Then another zombie goes on the phone and says ''more cops''. Then more cops come, and the zombies come out of the forest and eat them XD.

Second, yes this does indeed have the original soundtrack, it's in the options menu. Now, being that I was born in '93 and hadn't seen this movie until I was 15, I kinda 'grew up' with the edited soundtrack. So after hearing all of the fuss about this issue, I jumped at the chance to hear the difference. And... well, I don't know if it's just me, but I prefer the edited version. Mainly because A) in the old one, there's times when the music completely blocks out dialog, and B) Tarman (WHO IS THE SINGLE CREEPIEST BASTARD IN CINEMA HISTORY) sounds, well, silly in the old version. At least to me. But either way, this version has both options, so if you really want it, this is for you.

Third, this movie looks AMAZING in High-Def. I don't know all the technical aspects, but it looks better than any time I've seen it before. All the gory details shine through like never before.

This movie was forced to be made practically because this was before the advent of CGI. Although I love movies like Shaun Of The Dead and Zombieland, this movie couldn't cheat with CG blood or digital effects, all of the zombies had to be made the traditional way and it worked flawlessly. While this may not be the best shot or acted zombie movie, for me this is one of the best zombie movies ever made, something I watch every October now and something I have every cult classic, horror, or zombie fan friend of mine, watch. If you like zombie movies, campy cult classics done well, great make up effects and design, gore, or hot naked chicks, then there isn't any reason you won't like this movie. This I highly recommend.

Spoilers want braaaaaaaiiins!!!!!

What can we say about writer/director Dan O'Bannon (Dark Star, Alien, Dead &Buried, The Return of the Living Dead and Shatterbrain ) other than ouch that film hurt.  For collaborating with John Carpenter on the sci-fi cult classic Dark Star to being known as the sci-fi and horror script doctor, he strived to move into directing his first film.  This turkey and it will be delightful no doubt.  Let's snuggle in for the film.

Two bumbling employees Frank (James Karen of All My Children, Wall Street, Mulholland Dr. and The Pursuit of Happyness) and Freddy (Thom Mathews of Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI, The Return of the Living Dead Part II and Bloodmatch) are idly babbling when Freddy asks Frank what is the craziest thing he ever saw on the job and Frank leads Freddy down in the basement to show off a government creation gone awry and the canister that re-animated it.  The collective heads of knuckle accidently release the gas and re-animate anything of a cadaver, a butterfly collection and some dissected dogs set for a veterinarian college.  The duo calls their boss Burt (Clu Gulager of The Tall Man, The Virginian, The Last Picture Show, Feast, Feast II: Sloppy Seconds and Feast III: The Happy Finish) to come down to assist them in bodily dismemberment and then burn the rest of the body in the crematorium across the street causes the gas inside the zombie to be released into the atmosphere and carried in the rain sopping the ground in liquid for that happen to be right next to the cemetery.  OooOo a new spin on the term ""plot point"" and Freddy's friends just relaxing in the cemetery and the creatures arise.  With countless references to the original Night of the Living Dead, being it is public domain; our gaggle of morons attempts to kill the brain.

 These particular zombies are quick, able to speak and are fairly intelligent.  From sneak attacks through windows to picking off police squads left and right, these zombies are a different breed.  Could have done without the FX of Tarman, a zombie character of slimed flesh flopping off the bone and dripping everywhere, suffice to say I didn't want chili for some odd reason.  With dark humor and the stumbling everyday man elements this could be considered entertaining.  Oh and yes boys there be boobies...",1347235200,,2568,4.691964285714286

380207,3,6301932420,"Return of the Living Dead from what I understand is made by someone who had something to do with Night Of the Living Dead. I am not a huge enough fan to care about names, but from what I was informed, two or more people where in charge of Night of the Living Dead, and one wanted to keep going in the horror direction in a serious manner, and the one here responsible for Return of the Living Dead wanted a bit more of a horror/comedy direction, not to be taken all that seriously. I think that may be where a lot of lower raters missed the point. It wasn't meant to be a gore fest of serious zombies coming back from the grave, it was meant to be a fun ride to enjoy.

The plot is that the 1969 film Night of the Living Dead was based on a true story, only what was in the movie was changed for the movie so no one would know the truth. What supposedly really happened was the army created a chemical that was supposed to fight marijuana, as a weed killer or something, but instead it's effects where much worse, as it can bring the dead back to life, or kill and turn any living thing into a zombie within a few minutes to a few hours. So the chemical was contained in barrels and supposed to have been taken away by the army to be destroyed. But one of these canisters is still around, in the warehouse where this movie takes place. Inside a storage building, two guys find the barrel and one explains the story or where it came from and how it came to be in their possession. The canister ends up cracking open, and the chemical is released, unleashing one of the coolest looking zombies in film history nick named Tar Man. Of coarse, there is a graveyard across the road, and the dead return, hungry for brains as the people still alive try to run and hide and look for a way to stop the zombie outbreak or find a way to escape. Will they get out? Well, if you haven't seen the film, you will have to find out for yourself.

There are 5 Return of the Living Dead movies. Some may not know about the more recent ones, but all in all, parts 1 and 2 are the only ones I can highly recommend watching. When I first saw this movie, I was on the edge of my seat to see how the survivors who are not infected would get out of this mess. The ending was a little of both disappointing and cool at the same time, but I don't give the movie more then a 3 to 3 and a half star rating due to the end that I was not happy about to be honest with you. I know a lot of people are satisfied, but I felt drawn in so much I wanted a better ending. But oh well, what can we do now? It's still a decent cult favorite, even tho some of the actors are highly annoying and do things for no reasons, like getting naked, but I guess that was what you expected to see in every 80's horror flick. Apart from that, it's still a classic B-grade horror flick with a cool 80's metal soundtrack to go along with it.",1327104000,,2887,4.02787456445993

380209,4,6301932420,"""The Return Of The Living Dead"", written and directed by Dan O'Bannon, and starring Clu Gulager, James Karen and Don Calfa performing at their over-the-top best, is one of the prime examples of the no-holds-barred camp zombie movies to date, with laughter-inducing imagery, lines such as ""Send...more...paramedics"" and ""They're rabid weasels"" to a soundtrack with tunes by legendary punk rock groups such as The Cramps.  The supporting cast includes ""Scream Queen"" Linnea Quigley as Trash, a red-haired punker with a tendency to take her clothes off on a random and frequent basis and dance on the tombs in the local graveyard.

The plot: at the Uneeda Medical Supply (you have to love the name) warehouse in a small town in Kentucky, foreman Frank (Karen) decides to show the new employee, Freddy, some old military barrels that accidentally ended up in the basement. Containing the leftovers of the botched army experiment that inspired the classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968), the gas inside the barrels sprays all over when Frank starts fiddling with the containers, putrid zombies break out, and the fun is just beginning as Frank phones his boss Burt (Gulager).  Burt rushes over to try and help contain the problem, but of course matters only worsen (split dogs!  headless cadavers running amok!), so the two enlist the help of his mortuary friend (Calfa).

Freddy's teenage friends and his squeaky-voiced goody two-shoes girlfriend Tina show up at the supply house to pick him up when he gets off work, and become entangled in the havoc.

""The Return Of The Living Dead"" is a truly hilarious camp classic of zombie films, a must-see for first-timers and a must-see-again-and-again for all fans of zombie films.",1321660800,,1724,5.052816901408451

380211,5,6301932420,"Writer/director Dan O'Bannon (1946-2009) wanted to take the zombie genre in a different less serious direction, and his The Return Of The Living Dead (1985) certainly does this, and works in the areas where it counts the most.  The story is solid, the characters well defined, the acting is great for the genre, and the special effects campy and very well done.  If you like horror/comedy, there's not much to complain about here.

Employees at Uneeda medical supply open a metal canister containing military waste releasing toxic gas that infects some workers, and also reanimates a dead body.  Burt (Clu Gulager) the owner of Uneeda, helps his workers kill the zombie, then gets his mortician buddy Ernie (Don Calfa) to do him a favor, and let him use his crematorium to dispose of the body.  As the zombie remains are going up in smoke, a rainstorm begins, and the zombie ash sprinkles down with the rain, seeping through the soil, and reanimating the dead in a local graveyard, as well as affecting people in the area.  The undead rise up from their graves, and begin to look for something to eat.  The mortuary becomes a sanctuary for the survivors in the area, who are besieged by roving bands of zombies, hungry for human brains.  The chances for escape seem bleak, as zombie outbreak spreads, and riots break out in the street.  When Burt has the bright idea to call the army for help, the military takes quick and decisive action to deal with the situation.

It's pretty rare to find a horror movie where nearly everything works, and The Return Of The Living Dead is that rare exception.  The plot is out there, but it still makes sense in a crazy kind of way.  The film is full of unexpected shocks, with zombies appearing where you least expect.  And these are fast moving zombies, that can think and speak.  Other highlights include a tar covered zombie, a zombie interrogation, and a fully naked woman (Linnea Quigley) rising from the mud to walk with the undead.  Unlike most horror films, there aren't characters that are extremely annoying, and the dialog doesn't drive you nuts.  Strong energetic performances by Clu Gulager (Feast films), James Karen, Don Calfa, Thom Mathews, Brian Peck, Beverly Randolph, and many others, help bring the story alive with just the right tone and attitude, energized by a spirited 80's era soundtrack.

Dan O'Bannon, whose impressive writing credits include Alien (1979), Total Recall (1990), Blue Thunder (1983) and Screamers (1985), demonstrates a flair for humor as well as horror, in his directorial debut.  Hardcore fans will want to get the Bluray edition, which in addition to improved image quality, contains additional extras not available on the previous editions.",1311120000,2,2725,4.8997821350762525

Distributor: MGM Video (US)

""How do you kill something that's already dead?""

For some time now, The Return of the Living Dead has been on Obscura's most wanted Blu-ray list. On first hearing of this release some months ago, we were very keen to see if the wait would ultimately prove worth while. Thankfully and just for the print quality alone, it was.

Having seen the film across countless video releases and DVD releases over the years, finally seeing the HD print proved to be a real treat. The film is presented with a strong 1080p 1.85:1 widescreen transfer, which looks excellent considering the original low budgets of the movie itself. Colours are a real eye opener and look vibrant throughout, black levels appear strong and there is a definite increase on the available detail here. The transfer quality, really is a lot better than expected.

Audio is presented in DTS HD and dialogue is both clear and effective. Running through the whole film, the classic punk rock anthems are given a real boost. One point worth noting however is that the soundtrack on this Blu-ray is the same as the previous DVD release which has received some audio substitutions. These include a change to the pitch on Tarman's famous ""brains"" quotes and some lessening of the background music during certain scenes. Apparently these changes were director approved and although the Tarman of the 80's sounded funnier and yet more creepy than his new deeper voice suggests, this isn't enough to ruin an otherwise excellent presentation.

The extras offered on this release are ported over from the recent special edition DVD including a cast commentary track, a director commentary, a modern day making of documentary and a reasonably in depth feature about 1980's horror movies.

The only real negative in this release, is that yet again, the many deleted scenes and extensive workprint footage is nowhere to be seen. Any long term fan of the film will be aware that much alternate footage exists, including a very different ending. Instead of including a pretty much otherwise useless DVD disc with this package, it would have been preferable to have included a workprint version or at the very least, some deleted scenes on the second disc.

Still, all things considered, The Return of the Living Dead makes an impressive dbut on Blu-ray, the print quality here really makes a big difference over previous releases and it's safe to say that this is probably the best this film will ever look. For fans of classic 1980's zombie/horror movies, this is a must have title, and for everyone else, you could actually do a lot worse than adding this one to your collection. Be advised though, if the curse of region coding still affects your purchasing decisions, this release is locked to A.

The original fast running, brain munching, paramedic and cop calling living dead, have never appeared as intense.

Oh and ""watch your tongue, boy, if you like this job!""

380274,5,6301932420,"the movie is five star but ....This blu ray  movie is a step up in clarity from the dvd , but just only , it's not remastered and they should have done this because it's one of the greatest horror movies ever made. The soundtrack is still not the same as the theatrical release either.  This should have been dealt with long ago but nope. The cover of the box is a bad pick too considering the classic punk zombie poster we all love so well.  This is a huge disapointment for me but I had to get this one because the picture is better on blu ray. Someone needs to do this movie justice though. This isn't as bad as the terrible prints used in the terminator though or robocop. there are no lines but it's not color corrected and is just the 2007 dvd print stuck on blu ray. mgm has dropped the ball big time.  However that being said this movie is on a whole other level of horror goodness that you need it in your collection. Few movies have combined such wit and humour with horror and did it in a way that is perfectly horror and not comedy in the slightest.  Why can't they do this right? No blu ray release should be just slung out there.  Get the original music back, and remaster this!  But if you are like me and have to have this complete classic of a movie and it is that! then the best version available is this blu ray version.  the extras are the same from the earlier dvd releases too by the way.  at least it has them, and personally I could do without dvd releases with my blu ray.

Linnea Quigley is in it (the  scream queen of all horror girls) and she plays the very sexy redhead Trash in the group of punks.

This BR + DVD Combo is Nothing Short then How every BR Disc should be  (You get the Fully Loaded 2nd Print DVD of ROTLD along with The HD BR Transfer with every Extra too!

Return of the Living Dead is without a Doubt the Best American Non George Romero Zombie Film

Clu Gulager said it best ROTLD is more Than a Horror Film it is Art!

This Film holds allot of Memories Growing up.
The 1st time i seen it i was Young 6yrs old or so  (And it Scared me allot) Didn't help I lived maybe 150ft from a cemetery
Years later i would Catch it on tv and fall in love with it as A Close to Perfect Film That does so much more then typical Horror Movies.
I've owned almost every Commercial Release (VHS, Both DVD Cuts now the BR) Could never find the Rare LaserDisc

Dan O'Bannon's Return of the Living Dead is such a stand out film
That is Perfect in so many ways.
The Story/Script is very smart tips a Hat at ""The Godfather of the Dead"" George A. Romero but, in no way Rips of his Vision.
And creates a New Set of Rules! Fast Moving Zombies (Few Films Can pull of Fast Moving Corpses! Nightmare City, ROTLD, 28Days Later and ""Remake of DOTD are the few that come to mind.
Zombies that talk, Ect.
The F/X are extremely good! Allot of Practical Effects that Still to this day Holds up and gives the film a Real Quality to it
The soundtrack is a Perfect fit (From the Opening Scene with James Karen & Thom Mathews getting blasted in the face with the Chemical the music comes in at the Right Place and it sets up the Pace of a Wild Fun Ride!
IMO the Best Horror Soundtracks are Phantasm, Dawn of the Dead, Suspiria, Halloween, and  ROTLD
The Cast is so Good (I'd say its one of the Best Film Cast of the 1980's
You have 3 Veteran actors  Clu Gulager, James Karen, and Don Calfa with a Group of Young Actor's Thom Mathews, Beverly Randolph, John Philbin, Jewel Shepard, Miguel Nunez, Brian Peck, Linnea Quigley, Mark Venturini.  The Young Cast Members having to look like they walked from Sex Pistols Concert!
Another New Unique thing Punk Rock Teens vs The Undead
Each actor Brings so much to this Film. The Scenes between James Karen and Thom Mathews are wonderful the 2 Click and Really Hold nothing back those 2 do the most heavy lifting since they have to Change Mentally and Physically and they Sell it!
You truly feel bad for them 'Cause you are watching them die and you know what they are gonna become!
ROTLD also has one of the Most Iconic Zombies of all Time
There are 2 Actor's That Really know  how 2 Play dead it would be  (Romero's Day) Sherman Howard as  Bub and
Allan Trautman as Tarman  Both of them Really showcase what fine Actor's They are Cause they are doing allot of Physical things without using Dialog

The BR + DVD Combo Pack might comes Close 2 The Ultimate Collection (But, it is Missing all the Workprint Footage including the Original Ending)
I've read a few reviews of the HD Picture Quality.  IMO the PQ is very good. Some Scenes Look Flawless and pop out, Crisp and Clean.... Some scenes not the best But, It's going in the right step
(Compared to the Dreadful  HD Transfers of Robocop, The Terminator, and the 1st Print BR of Predator)

380322,5,6301932420,"In 1968, George Romero and John Russo wrote a zombie film that would reinvent the Horror genre and fear itself. Nearly twenty years later, Russo would team up with Sci-Fi guru Dan O'Bannon, writer of the seminal ALIEN, to create RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, the first major zombie breakthrough in America outside of Romero's original trilogy, and still one of the most successful and hilarious Horror Comedies of all time.

The film proposes that the events in the DEAD films were real, and that the bodies of the undead corpses were shipped around the country in containers sealed by the government. When a group of punks unwittingly breach the seals on one of these containers, a horde of fiendish ghouls are unleashed in a nearby cemetery as the group struggles to survive! RETURN's exaggerated comic book characters are living embodiments of 80s pop culture, and each are written with a biting cynicism and sharp wit. 80s genre favorites Miguel Nunez, Linnea Quigley, and Thom Mathews line the cast, and are joined by Golden Age actors Clu Gulager, James Karen, and Don Calfa. Cannibalistic ghouls had been clamoring for fresh meat since the late 60s, but it wasn't until 1985 that their tastes turned to a more delectable delicacy: ""Braaaaains.."" As the re-animated corpses would tell you themselves, brains became the only cure for the pains of death, resulting in a series of brutal attacks and head-munching. By this time, Tom Savini had become synonymous with gore and zombie make-up FX, but here, Allan Apone brings O'Bannon's original conceptions to life with equally (if not more) memorable creations, the most impressive of which being the skeletal Tar Man. The film's down-trodden ending is as much a comment on the expendability of 80s youth as it is a satirical look at Reagan-era politics, where nuclear holocaust was just a button away.

Where Romero's DEAD series adapted the true life horrors of racial discrimination and consumerism into a frightening NIGHT, DAWN, and DAY of terror, O'Bannon's tongue-in-cheek approach is just as valid and as smart as its obvious influences. RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD will remain one of the all-time genre classics, and a staple in 80s Horror viewing!

Movies such as ""Dead Alive"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"", both awesome movies, would take influence from this classic.

Although there's no really scary moment in here, aside a few startling jumps towards the end, (and the real scary part is the underlying political statement at the end), this movie is full of zombie-related laughs that, any horror fan would love. Even though the central focus is the zombie comedy, there's lots of nudity and even some decent gore scenes in here! This is all-around strong, and will have you laughing all the way through the comedic scenes, staring at the nudity scenes and have your heart pumping during the bloodier scenes.

But these aren't your typical slow-moving ""Night of the Living Dead"" zombies; these ones are fast, smart, and capable of speaking (but only a bit). They're like the ones in the 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"", if you exclude the smart and speaking part. The victims of these brain-eating maniacs are not your typical teenage idiots; these are punk-rocking outsiders who aren't afraid of messing around in cemeteries, and that's saying a lot. The SFX are very realistic even if it's made in the 80's. There are no lame CGI effects; puppets and honest makeup effects are all around. And the heavy metal/punk rock soundtrack makes it all the more worth watching. It's nice to see a break from the stereotypical flesh eaters for a change.

I also recommend ""Shaun of the Dead"" and the original ""Dawn of the Dead"". The black humor works on all three films.

380385,4,6301932420,"I've heard of so many Living Dead movies that I can never really tell which is which or what is original but I do know that this one was pretty good. Return of the Living Dead is a zombie horror film with some pretty sick and creative creatures in it. The story goes in 1966 a chemical company was ordered to create a secret chemical for the military. The company was told that the chemical would treat soldiers for something but this comes out to be absolutely false. Two idiots accidentally break a can and it leaks in a hospital morgue. The bodies start to come back to life and won't stop until they get human brains in them.

After fighting off some of the zombies, a few men find a way to destroy the newly energized bodies. What these guys didn't know was this plan would make things worse. In fact, this plan would turn out to be so worse that the casualties become ridiculous cause these zombies are smart enough to get what they want and keep on going.

I have to say that for an old movie, the picture and sound was pretty darn good. One major factor in a good zombie flick or anything with such creatures is that they have to actually be scary looking. Not just that, they have to look pretty real as well. The zombies in here were pretty cool, there is this one thing that is covered in tar that looked really sick. This had pretty cool character creations and some crazy scenes with zombies having some late night dinner.

The story was OK, pretty much what you see in most zombie movies where a chemical pretty much leaked out. I guess since this came out so long ago it doesn't really matter. Only thing I didn't like was the acting and script. I don't know if in a movie like this it means a whole lot but when the dialogue is super choppy at times. For example, the actors stumble over their lines as if they're doing improv, it doesn't really help the film.

Practical Joker middle-aged Frank (Jim Karen) takes the first shot as he trains teenage clueless freddy (Tom Matthews) in a medical supply warehouse. Why? Simply because Frank claims ""that"" movie was based on real events: An incident in a military base involving a nerve-gas chemical so powerful, it can turn corpses into brain thirsty monsters. And several cannisters of that chemical are hidden in the basement, lost in a delivery confusion. Of course Frank had to show freddy the cannisters and the expected accident happens: The chemical is released, Frank and Freddy inhale it and get knocked-down, while one the most original, outrageous, hysterical, creepy and funny versions of the zombie apocalypse is unleashed: ""The Return of the living dead"", a bloody title posted in  the most gruesome possible way thanks to the melting face of one of the most infamous zombie characters ever conceived, ""The Tar-man"". Let the angry corpse catastrophe begins, as the medical specimens of the warehouse, included the frozen human corpse in the freezer room, half-dogs and nailed insects come to life in one of the most disturbing but funny nightmares ever filmed.

Ignored by critics and considered just another horror B-Movie popcorn flick, a Romero's satyrical teenage film, garbage as well as the tons of cheap horrors movies saturating the 80's industry, this movie is one of the most funny, entertaining and important Zombie films released in the 80's. Dan O'Bannon directed in 1985 this teen, punk rock soundtrack horror epic that became a legend among horror fans worldwide. Not a masterpiece obviously, and the differences with the Romero zombie mythology are hughe, so let's disect this movie with the help of Romero and find out why this movie is so different and awesome.

- ZOMBIE CULTURE: Forget Zombies, those slow-motion and staring ghouls wondering around without direction, more actual dizzy, pale people. Romero teached us: This is creepy because they are us. Now in 1985, Enter the rotten CORPSES, out of the grave, hungry and angry predators. Compared to these ravenous, frenetic and carnivorous human-remains, Romero's zombies are almost polite, even shy. They can also speak and they scream in pain out of nasty hunger, they run, they eat brains instead of flesh, they are gory monsters, not ""us"" anymore. And what about the renegade body parts, or the Tar-man, THE zombie of all times: Hear him breathe through his rotten-to-fluid lungs! Creepy! Lucio Fulci's or Mario Bava's rotten corpses? Sand of another bag. This is Comedy after all.

-THE RIGOR MORTIS: By far the most important point: Why reanimated corpses eat brain? How does it feel to be dead? How does the so well described Rigor Mortis functions in order to create a thrilling experience on the viewer, based on Frank and Freddy's ""descent to hell of the undead"" experience? The sickness, the numbness, the pain. This movie is all about PAIN, the pain of the living dead, not the victims. For the first time in such a goffy, horrific and entertaining way. With Romero, get bitten and after an hour you die and become a ghoul. The transformation in this film  is original and agonizing, detailed, long and psychologically tense, devastating.

-PUNK ROCK AND GRAVEYARDS: Silly drunken Teenage punk rockers, why do you love to party in graveyards? Don't you know you will get your brains eaten? Who's fault is that, that we love so much the slaughter of the young in horror movies? Sadism meets a limit here: the teens are clever enough to react fast and with efficiency. Some of the characters are silly but not forgetable as the usual B-horror flick moron teen. They deserve to live, we cheer for them, not against. Cops? They die well. Military? Were are they and who cares. Great action, tension, dense humor and macabre situations. Run just to get trapped. Amazing electrifying action.

Those three points were the most important i can think of right now. A genre defining movie came out this B-movie Popcorn flick. A must see for horror fans, and HEY! New fans of this relentless and commercial new horror industry of re-makes, extreme mutants slashers and torture: CHECK THIS OUT! FUN, FUN, FUN. Cheesy, humurous, gruesome imagery. A real self-aware zombie movie, a total classic.

Last Thing for my fellow horror friends: Who cares about what Zombies ""Should"" do according to father Romero, as long as we're falling from the edge of our seats!
Think about it. My respects for the father, who i never worshiped fortunately, and for you.

Enjoy this incredibly relentless movie in the best DVD edition available, this one:  Look at the box, the extra material. I own the previos MGM release and they are pretty much the same, but for first timers, here's your edition! A must have, definetly.",1205712000,12,4829,4.98014888337469

The zombies are smarter and faster than Romero's, but not as quick as the ""28 (blank) Later"" or ""Dawn of the Dead (2004) zombies. What really makes this movie special, though, it's the touches of wit that spice the entire picture. From split dogs to zombies that beg for the authorities to ""Send more cops"", to the awesome 'tarman' zombie, this starting point for the often misunderstood ROTLD series really goes the extra mile.

380394,3,6301932420,"I recently had a itch for all things zombies. I found that I loved George A. Romero's trilogy and I had a hunch to try other films too. My understanding of ""Return of the Living Dead"" is that it follows Romero's first film, ""Night of the Living Dead."" If you're looking for a Romero, you're going to be disappointed with Return of the Living Dead.

Okay, I admit I laughed at some times in this movie. The part where the paramedics came out and tried to explain to a group of people that they were legally dead (blood pressure 0, body temperature is room temperature, and pulse is 0) was hilarious. Other parts were creepy, but the overall atmosphere of the movie is supposed to be funny.

Viewing this movie on the whole, however, is not so great. The zombies were not believable - unlike Romero's zombies, the zombies in this movie are fast moving, fully able to understand the living and able to keep coming even after being shot in the brain. I also liked the satire element of Romero's film, which wasn't present in Return of the Living Dead.

Overall, I think the movie would appeal to someone looking for a comedy about the living dead. I wasn't, and therefore I was not pleased with this film. I give it a three because it's funny, but I didn't like the fact that it had basically zero value attached to it.

MGM released a respectable dvd of ROTLD a few years back and it was great to finally have it available on dvd, with extras no less.

Only the little mall chick that married the crew member (forgot her name) was entertaining with any insight into the movie at all, everyone else was too busy talking over each other and the zombies interupted some key points she was trying to make.

A true cult horror comedy classic of the 80's! Dan 'O Bannon (Writer of ""Alien"", ""Dead & Buried"", ""Heavy Metal"" and ""Lifeforce"") has wrote and direct a genuine and clever spoof of George A. Romero's zombie movies. Linnea Quigley does a very seductive nude dancing scene that will make guys cheer, there's very good acting especially by James Karen and some nifty zombie & gore make-up effects such as the memorable Tar-Man zombie.  What also works with this movie is some dark humor and one of Cinema's first fast moving zombies, it's great fun and a must have zombie movie for any horror fan's collection.

This special edition DVD has excellent picture and sound with cool extras like two audio commentaries, theatrical trailers, a featurette on the film itself, a featurette on 80's MGM horror, a designing the Dead featurette and zombie subtitles for the film.

380434,5,6301932420,"I've alway's enjoyed this movie.  In fact I put it into the catagory of my ""cable classics"" as I was too young to see it when it hit the theaters.  The combination of carnage, boobies, and gore based humor was awsome at the time and still stands up to this day although the wardrobe and some of the slang dates it.

I'll preface this by saying that I've got the DVD version that came out in 2002, and that was great.  I was very happy at it's special features at the time.  This edition is great in it's own right.  I won't expound on the features carried over from the first DVD offering, so if you want to hear about that go to one of the other reviews.

New Special Features include:

1.  The first new feature is a great retrospective with a good many of the cast and crew.  Great fun seening what they look like now and how they view the film in retrospect.  I'd liked to have seen more, but it was well done.

2.  The second new feature is a really cool documentery about the status of horror in the 1980's which interviews quite a few prominent film directors about thier experiences of making horror films in the '80s.  Almost worth the price of the DVD by itself.

3.  Commentary by some of the cast and crew.  Loads of fun until someone decides to impersonate a zombie.  That gets old really fast, but thankfully the commentaters cut it short (although not early enough for my taste, as I feel we've missed out on some info, but we'll never know).  Otherwise it's very fun hearing the various cast members relate their experiences from the filming and reactions from the public even years later.

To address a few things I've seen online about this version:

1.  Yes, the cover artwork isn't great, but that's just the cardboard slipcover; which is forgivable given the rest.  The actual DVD wrap art is sweet and worthy.  Additionally, the cardboard slipcover is glow in the dark, which I've submitted a photo of to Amazon, although I don't know if they will publish it.

2.  I can't speak to earlier comments about the soundtrack and over dubbing.  I've never watched the movie on VHS, and only have vague, but fond memories of seeing it on cable as a young lad.  You'll have to make up your own mind as to whether this affects the viewing experience for yourself.

3.  The Zombie audio track.  I didn't bother listening to this, and feel a bit bad about writing a review of the DVD without doing so, but if it's anything like the zombie intrusion on the cast track I can live with that.

All in all this is the superior of the DVD releases for this film.  If you have not seen this Zombie movie, then you really owe it to yourself to add it to your collction, and if you own the original release and love the film, then it will enlighten you to a few more aspects and broaden the experience which will be worth the double dip.

My only real disappointment is that they did not include the full interviews with the cast and crew used for the retrospective feature as a bonus feature.  That would have been a boon and I suspect a lot of fun.  Otherwise it's a great package.

Either way, if you are a zombie movie lover you should definately own this film.

380435,5,6301932420,"I'll get the complaint out of the way first... THE EDITED SOUNDTRACK! I know it seems minor, and compared to what Warner Bros. did to Part II, it's miniscule, but I'm still kind of irked that MGM can't seem to correct the soundtrack from their original DVD release. This IS, after all, one of my favorite movie soundtracks ever. It only happens in three scenes, and two of them are just shortened. The only one that's actually replaced is 'The Damned' - 'Dead Beat Dance', that originally played in the scene when the group is going to pick up Freddy... Why they edited and replaced some songs, I have no idea. Possibly something to do with the rights. So I'm glad 'Return of the Living Dead' was one of the few VHS's I didn't sell... Wish I could say the same about Part II. Although the sequel is nowhere NEAR as clever or horrifying...

SPOILERS

Still, the movie remains the classic it was in '84. I'll give a brief plot synopsis. Freddy is being given the rundown on life in the MEDICAL SUPPLY WAREHOUSE business (the back of the package says it's an Army surplus store) by his boss, Frank. The two unwittingly unleash a toxic chemical developed by the Army that causes the dead to become reanimated. On their way to pick up Freddy from his first day on the job, his punk-rock friends decide to stop off in the loacal cemetary and the horror ensues, especially when our would-be victims discover that these zombies are a little harder to kill then the ones George Romero cooked up in his classic 'Night of the Living Dead', of which this might be considered a very loose spin-off... Along with some GREAT tombstone action from Linnea Quigley, there's also a fair deal of humor along the way, but I gotta admit... This movie still gives me chills. Far more so than any other zombie movies, with the exception of Romero's films. The zombie interrogation scene, where the zombie explains that it hurts to be dead, and you can feel yourself rot... I mean, just the IDEA of that STILL creeps me out. Although the reaction to this from Spider always gets a laugh out of me. Also, the ending is pretty chilling. The Army's ""plan"" is classic, and in a way, coldly realistic.

The cast and characters are excellent. Everybody in the film hands in a memorable performance. I really love Clu Gulager in this. I mean, his portrayal of the average middle-aged joe, with that old members-only jacket and everything (Did anyone else's dad used to wear that? Besides Al Bundy, I mean...), suddenly cast into this incredible situation is a sight to behold. I think the rest of the cast is just as great, but he makes this working-class guy so memorable.

The picture and audio of the DVD and all that stuff is perfect. I already had the other DVD, but I got this one hoping the soundtrack would be corrected, but I gotta say the two featurettes more than justified it. I'm glad they were able to get interviews with so many of the cast members. Anyway, I first saw the film probably about fifteen years ago, I've seen it numerous times since then, and it's still one of the funnest horror flicks I've ever seen. Definately in my top 5.",1189641600,5,3123,4.531914893617022
380436,5,6301932420,"Although it is overlooked by many horror fans, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is a very important film for it updates the ""zombie movie"" into a fully mature sub-genre inside horror cinema. We all know Romero's great trilogy NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD and DAY OF THE DEAD. These were great films for they were the true beginning of the ""zombie movie"". But in the 80's, the zombies lost terrain to the slasher movies (in the FRIDAY THE 13th tradition) and more compeling villains (in the Fred Krueger tradition).

Being a zombie fan, O'Bannon knew that the zombies needed an updating. This is why RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is so important: it brought the zombies into the 80's character/action oriented horror films. With this thought, he wrote a great screenplay that rewrote the ""zombie genesis"". So, in this film, the zombies of George A. Romero are refered as a mild version of something that was really true: a chemical accident in India that ended as an Army cover-up operation; and the Romero's zombies just a way of putting it into films without being bothered by the U.S. Army.

Having established that point, O'Bannon introduces us to the REAL zombies: living dead that talk and move (they run!) just as living people do. They are extremely dangerous because they are not those dumb slow-moving zombies people used to walk through (like in the Romero's films). They are also intelligent as they devise ways of getting what they want - brains. And this is where O'Bannon makes a new wonderful twist: the zombies do not die by destroying their brains (for they are already dead and the brain has nothing to do with it). Instead it is the zombies who try to eat living brains!

Having said that, it is also important to point that the screenplay is a beautiful piece of cinematic storytelling for two reasons. FIRST because the whole story works flawlessly in the sense that the inicial incident, the characters' actions and the consequences are very well constructed. SECOND because the story weaves a sense of loneliness and confinement (I am talking about the way they treat the narrative space in relation to the story) that works wonders with the characters and what happens with them (this treatment of space echoes Romero's masterpiece DAWN OF THE DEAD).
The ending is great (so great that the sequels didn't touch it)and the soundtrack is very good. The actors are well cast and the film boasts a lot of dry humour.

The extras in this DVD special edition are fine and they show that a good edition of a film who's by now more that 20 years old is a matter of wanting it. Congratulations to MGM! RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is not the best horror movie ever, but inside the zombie sub-genre it is one of the best things ever made. Scarry and fun!

The only flaw (for me) in this movie is a female zombie who speaks without lips. I never found it credible.

The plot of the movie is no where near believable.  Apparently, the original Night of the Living Dead really happened and the government covered it up.  Ludicrous as that might sound, I don't think the movie would deny or, for that matter, be ashamed at how silly the plot is.  If anything, it's proud of it.

So I'm not going to waste my time explaining the plot.  Just know that virtually the whole movie takes place near a graveyard.  And it involves a group of teenage kids who, while waiting for their friend who works at a near-by mortuary connected to the government coverup, decide to party at the graveyard.  What could possibly go wrong?

Despite its predictability, this movie absolutely works because the people who made it seemed like they had a fun time making it.  And that's what really counts.

The movie doesn't try to take itself too seriously, but does not ever cross into the ridiculous.  The zombies are a real threat and require more than the Romero-inspired headshot to put them down.

I think originally I didn't like the ""fast zombie"" or the fact that they were very difficult to put down.  However, as I matured as a zombie enthusiast, I came to appreciate those elements in this particular zombie world.

Without the ""fast"" zombie concept, I would not have got one of the biggest laughs in my life.  Without giving too much away, just know a couple of medical guys get bum rushed by a pack of zombies and pretty much form tackled ala. American style football.  I remember spending close to ten minutes laughing and rewinding that scene.

Some of the characters are a bit farcical, but it worked for me.

And may I say people say ""28 Days Later"" gave birth to the ""fast"" zombie.  Let it be known that ""Return..."" did it first... I remember being so scared that ""zombies"" could actually run you down.

380498,4,6301932420,"Return of the Living Dead has to go down as one of the funniest and inventive take on the zombie subgenre that began after the release of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead. Due to a dispute between Romero and John Russo (co-producer of the original NOTLD), the sequels to Night of the Living dead that were produced and directed by Romero dropped the ""Living Dead"" part in their titles. Russo retained the rights to create sequels using those words while Romero just kept the word ""Dead"" in the follow-up films to Night. It took Russo awhile, but he finally got to use those naming rights with 1985's Return of the Living Dead.

Even though there were some acrimony between Romero and Russo, the screenplay for Return of the Living Dead makes several complimentary nods to Night of the Living Dead. The film's premise was what if Romero's first film was actually based on a true event and that the government and the military covered it up before people got a wind of it. The film takes that simple premise and creates an action-packed horror-comedy that still stands the test of time.

Unlike Romero's films, ROTLD actually gives an explanation as to what causes the dead to return to life with a singular purpose of attacking the living. The cause of all this undead mayhem was due to a bioweapon nerve toxin called 2-4-5 Trioxin which was originally designed by the military to defoliate marijuana crops. To say that the side-effects of the gas had some interesting effects was an understatement. The zombies created by Trioxin do attack the living but they're also much more livelier and smarter (retaining agility, strenght and mental capacity of their previous life) than the traditional Romero-zombies. They also do not feed on just humans. They also feed on other animals. The last major difference between the Romero-zombies and the Trioxin-zombies was that the latter only wanted to feed on live brains to end the pain of being dead. These differences made for a much faster-paced horror movie. As much as I consider the Romero zombie films as the best out there, I hold a special place in my horror-fan heart for these Trioxin dudes.

The screenplay by John Russo and as directed by Dan O'Bannon also made ROTLD behave more as a horror-comedy than just a straight-up horror movie. The dialogue between the characters were full of great one-liners that would've sounded cheesy if not for the great and game performances from the cast. Clu Gulager as Burt Wilson (owner of the medical supplies warehouse where the lost canister of Trioxin was being stored in) did a great job being incredulous at the events happening around him. His back and forth with his friend Ernie (played with Peter Lorre eyes by Don Calfa), the local mortuary's gun-toting mortician, keep the film lively and hilarious in-between scenes of horror. The scene stealers in ROTLD must go to a bumbling pair of Burt's employees who inadvertently release the toxic and reanimating gas from the warehouse's inventory of Trioxin canister. James Karen as the worldly and cynical Frank was a riot from start to end. His over-the-top performance had me in stitches. He played Frank with such a manic, panicky style that it was difficult not to get caught up in his hysterics. To balance out Frank's Hardy with his more subdued, but no less panicked Laurel, was Thom Mathews as Freddy. Mathews would later appear in other horror movies in the decade and even reprise a similar role in the RTOLD sequel. His performance as the straight man to Karen's fool was also very good. His slow decline into becoming one of the zombies after the initial inhalation of the Trioxin gas in the film's introduction was funny and sad. Of all the zombies in the film he gets the brunt of the slapstick sequences, especially once he starts hunting his girlfriend for her brains. His professing of his love for her and at the same time wanting her to give up her brain was hilarious, if not creepy as well.

Another thing that ROTLD had that made it different from Romero's zombie movies were the scenes of gratuitious nudity throughout the film. A majority of the nude scenes were courtesy of scream queen Linnea Quigley as the punk rock Trash whose morbid obsession with all things death made her an early victim for the zombies and later on as one of their leaders. I know that kids my age at that time replayed over and over the scene of her strip-tease atop a graveyard headstone. Even now many fans of the film consider that sequence as one of their favorite.

Return of the Living Dead still counts as one of the best zombie movies out there and preceded the UK's Shaun of the Dead by two decades as a great horror-comedy. There was a sequel a few years later to capitalize on the popularity of the first film. It tried to capture the hilarity and horror of the first one but not measure up in the end.",1155081600,4,4872,4.70023419203747

The events that happen in this movie are like bad karma waiting to happen.  What happens when you put a medical supply warehouse(that stores cadavers) next to a funeral home that is equiped with an embalming room and a cremetorium, that just happens to be right next to a creepy moss covered Cemetary?  Nothing, but if you add this to the equation; in the basement of the medical supply warehouse are several canisters containing zombies that have been in a sleep stasis since they were contained during the original incident( not mentioned but hints at the events in Night of the living dead) Now add a couple of bumbling employees that are curious about the canisters and accidentally let one of the slimey critters out! Whoops! Not only do they let the sucker out the contaminate themselves, the cadaver and anything else that might be dead in the ware house.  Which leads to one of the most hilarious scenes in the film, when Freddy and Frank discover that one of the vetenary 'split dogs' has comeback to life and is yelping in pain, and then Frank beats it with a crutch! Outstanding.  Now throw in some punk rock looking hooligans and a rain storm and ya got yourself a really campy zombie film.  Theres plenty of gore and creepiness for splat fans.

B movie scream queen linea quigley plays the character trash, who ends up stripping nude except for a pair of leggings and dancing by torch light on top of a cement platform in the graveyard. Quigley fans get an eyeful.

There is also some gratuitous cursing going on by the token black character, he says the f word so many times in this film you think it was his job(reguardless of starring in this film)

Made mostly by a bunch of young people, even first timers, on a shoestring budget, who have an arresting kind of enthusiasm. Not burdened by any serious drama or presure from money-licking producing commitees, they just come together and make lovely, off beat horror, that, because of the afore mentioned enthusiasm that richly oozes from every frame, immediately suck the audience in a maelstrom of blood, gore, clever filming and witty jokes.

In ""The Return of the living dead"" a group of local punks mess around on a closed graveyard, not knowing that its inhabitant soon will emerge to the surface.

The reason for this finds its origin in a nearby warehouse. Two goofy characters, the pupil Freddy and his mentor Frank, accidently open up a tank with toxic chemicals (once belonged to a secret military operation), that used to bring the dead back to live.

After they burn up the remaining trash in the ovens of a mortuary, the chemicals get into the air and a frenzy Gothic rainshower spills the stuff on the graveyard and all hell breaks loose.

That's a fine cast we're having with a handful of weirdo's and would-be hoodlums that do battle with the undead while the soundrack bursts out with a coffin full of alternative rock and punk, like that of The Cramps, T.S.O.L. and Jet Black Jerries.

380504,4,6301932420,"Long before Shaun of the Dead, there was a movie that integrated comedy and zombie horror, this movie was Return of the Living Dead. A cult masterpeice, and one of my personal favorite zombie movies. This was the first of its kind to poke fun at itself, as well as another amazing zombie flick (Night of the Living Dead). This movie is an entertaining thrill ride from start to finish, with tons of great gore, lots of zombies, and naked girls galore.

The story starts when a young man, Freddy, starts a job at a medical supply center, he comes to find out that Night of the Living Dead was based on a true story, and all the bodies that came alive are in the basement of the building. Of course, something goes array, the chemical gets out, and all hella breaks loose. The cast of this movie is pretty unknown to anyone who doesnt absolutley love cult horror. Thom Mathews stars as Freddy, and does a fairly decent job at the role. But everyones favorite performance seems to be Linnea Quigley as Trash, the most memorable charecter, and Linnea puts her usual touch to the role by getting completely naked and dancing on a grave.

The special effects makeup in 'Return' are amazing, some of the best of its time. Particularly incredible is the Tar Man, the re-animated corpse of one of the dead zombies in the basement. The Half Woman is also visually amazing. The Soundtrack to 'Return' is great, filled with .45 Grave and The Cramps, and other such horror punk bands, i'd personally love to get a copy of it. As far as some of the differences between this and most zombie movies? These zombies run, and talk...which actually takes away a bit of the alure of a zombie flick, when we, as a culture, think about zombies, we think braindead hungry slow corpses, 'Return' decided to give their zombies a little bit more flavor. All in all, this movie is fantastic and is one of my favorite peices of cult horror. I recommend this movie to absolutley anyone. Its fun, its gory and its a wicked good time.",1149033600,,2002,4.512396694214876

380538,4,6301932420,"Described as a comic horror this zombie shocker nonetheless has some highly disturbing imagery and violence. Unlike other zombie movies there is no attempt to link the reanimation of the corpses with any science bearing a resemblance to real-life biology, these zombies are skeletal and a blow to the head makes no difference. Their skeletal appearance makes them more gruesome and terrifying than your regular zombies, this is nowhere more typical than in the cellar attack scene, which is a classic. Also unlike earlier zombie movies these ones can talk and even hold a conversation. The gang of teenagers who enter the zombie fray (only to get taken down one at a time) personify the 80's, the mullets and punk haircuts combined with the whole 'im an individual' attitude of the teenagers evokes memories of Michael Jackson and Megadeth years. Also very appropriate is the soundtrack, featuring glam rock tracks and techno rythms to heighten the tension and underline the action throughout. The comic moments in the film are many and to be celebrated, such as the newborn zombie moaning up at his hysterical girlfriend who is hiding from him in a cellar.. ""i forgive you darling and i know you are here, cause i can smell your brainssssssss"" and the half-corpse hobbling after the terrified morgue attendant. The humor is always of the black variety and while a classic zombie film in its own right it is also parodying earlier movies in the genre.

380539,5,6301932420,"For some reason, I hadn't yet seen Return of the Living Dead, even though I have been a loyal fan of zombie cinema since I first saw the original Dawn of the Dead five or six years ago.  Return of the Living Dead is one of those genre-bending films that is tough to place in one category.  Obviously, it is a zombie film, but the film really does not seem to take itself seriously.  This is best displayed when two characters try to kill a zombie by putting a pick-ax through its brain.  When that doesn't work, all one character can say is ""It worked in the movie!""  It is with that tone that film works as well as it does.  If you were supposed to take this film seriously, you would laugh yourself out of the room, because it just doesn't work on that level.  However, it absolutely works as a film for zombie aficionados that embrace these films even though they are so ridiculous and unbelievable.  The zombies in this film aren't like Romero zombies, in fact, they are completely original.  They basically have all functions of humans, except for the fact that they are extremely violent and always hungry for ""more brains!""  It is extremely amusing when the zombies get on the radio to call in more paramedics and cops, and when one zombie decides to portray himself as a police officer to set the trap for the rest of the cops.  Dan O'Bannon definitely knew what he was doing when he made this film, and he somehow found an original yet familiar take on the zombie genre to make his film stand alone in a field of look-alikes.  As if the rest of the movie weren't good enough, the ending of the movie is absolutely killer.  I don't know what it was about the ending, whether it was the cynicism, or maybe the realism, or it could have been the appropriateness, but any way you look at it, this ending was the perfect one for this film, and it wrapped up a great movie that is rightfully in its place in history as a great piece of horror filmmaking.",1143849600,,1957,4.358126721763085

380574,5,6301932420,"Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.

Horror-comedies can be an extremely tricky thing to pull off. Most filmmakers who attempt to do one usually veer too far in either direction and the result is usually quite less than stellar. But one thing I have noticed about a lot of horror films from the 80's is that some of the most memorable and excellent horror-comedies come from that decade. While Re-Animator, Bad Taste and The Toxic Avenger usually come to mind when 80's horror-comedies are mentioned, 1985's Return of the Living Dead ranks right up there with those classic film IMO and is an excellent example on how horror-comedies should be done.

While most people might think that this is some sort of pseudo-sequel of sorts to George Romero's classic zombie films, Return of the Living Dead (or ROTLD as I'll refer to it from now on) writer/director Dan O'Bannon took a completely different approach. According to this film, the events of the original B/W Night of the Living Dead ACTUALLY HAPPENED! But George Romero just changed a lot of the facts supposedly in his film. This allows ROTLD to pay tribute to that classic 1968 film while also making its own rules as far as zombie behavior and what happened to make the dead come back to life and have an insatiable appetite for human brains.

As the film starts out we meet Frank (James Karen) who works at the Uneeda Mecial Supply warehouse in Louisville, KY that is owned and operated by Burt Wilson (Clu Gulager). Frank is showing a new young employee by the name of Freddy (Thom Mathews) the ropes and how things operate in the warehouse. These scenes are especially funny as Frank and Freddy make a really funny comical team of sorts. Frank tells Freddy that there is supposedly a skeleton farm in India which is where almost all of the skeletons used in medical schools are sent out from. There's also a refrigerated room that has a dead body hanging from hooks in its ears for medical schools to use as well!

We also meet a collection of teenagers who are quite an eclectic bunch. There are the usual 80's punks but also a few that are sort of preppy. I've always wondered if the filmmakers meant for them to represent a complete cross section of mid-80's youth or something along those lines. One of the more prominent people other than Freddy's girlfriend in the group is the scream queen Linnea Quigley (who is called Trash) who spends much of the movie completely nude (and looking damn good I might add). One of the other girls is Freddy's girlfriend and they are trying to find something to do while waiting for Freddy to get off of work. They find they're way into a cemetary near the medical warehouse where Freddy is at just to burn some time.

While Frank is showing Freddy how to complete some forms, he asks Freddy is he's ever heard of the movie Night of the Living Dead. According to Frank, the events in that film really happened and that the dead were actually brought back to life by some sort of secret chemical that the military was working on to spray on marijuana plants. This chemical seeped down through the floor at some facility and caused the dead to come back to life. Turns out that some of these corpses were put in canisters and some of these canisters accidentally found their way to the Uneeda Medical warehouse 14 years ago.

Frank takes Freddy down in the basement to show him these canisters. Things start to get set in motion when Frank slaps the side of one of the canisters and the vaporous chemical is released in great quantity causing Frank and Freddy to pass out. They end up coming to about an hour later, but are extremely sick and sweating profusely. They go upstairs and they notice that a split-dog on one of the shelves has come back to life and the cadaver in the refrigerated room has also been re-animated and apparently isn't happy and wanting out.

Frank tries to take control of the situation by calling his boss Burt. Burt is completely upset that Frank messed with the canisters and calls on his friend Ernie Kaltenbrunner (Don Calfa) who runs a mortician shop across the street to burn the re-animated cadaver in his furnace after it gets chopped into pieces during a hilarious sequence in which Frank, Freddy and Burt find out that hitting the brain doesn't stop the zombies like it did in the movie Night of the Living Dead. (This scene contains some of my favorite lines of dialogue BTW).

This is where the movie really starts to pick up some serious pace. It also becomes apparent that all rules are out the window in the fact that bullets or sharp objects to a zombie's brain won't stop them.

While they are burning the body parts the smoke rises into the rain clouds and it immediately begins to rain making the zombie inducing chemicals rain down into the local cemetary bringing the dead back to life.

Meanwhile, Frank and Freddy are getting sicker and looking really bad. Until the paramedics arrive, nobody has figured out that they are actually quite dead and slowly turning into zombies.

The rest of the gang in the cemetary end up getting attacked by the zombies and take refuge in the medical supply warehouse where Freddy's girlfriend is trapped downstairs by a memorable zombie that has been dubbed Tar-Man by the filmmakers. She went in there earlier to try to find Freddy and got trapped.

What is truly great about the film up until this point is how funny it truly is while also managing to gross you out at the same time. There is a growing sense of dread that is occuring throughout the course of the film as things go from bad to worse.

Another thing that set this film apart from the majority of other zombie films (beside the great sense of humor) was the fact that the zombies in ROTLD can actually run instead of just lumbering around. Another great aspect to the living dead in this film is that they can actually think and are quite quick witted in some respects. Witness the scenes in which they keep ambushing the police officers and paramedics by using their CB's to call for more ""assistance"" (yes, the zombies can talk in this film as well).

The film takes a little more of a serious tone during the third act but it is appropriate in the overall structure and the humor takes a little more of a back seat to the horror elements.

The acting is pretty much great with James Karen and Thom Mathews proving to be a great comic team. Clu Gulager is also hilarious as their boss Burt. But the one who steals the show is Don Calfa as the mortician Ernie. His performance is hilarious and some of his reactions and deliveries of his lines are truly inspired. The rest of the young cast does solid work as well with the exception of Linnea Quigley. As great as she looks nude in this film, her acting left quite a bit to be desired. But thankfully, she isn't the focal point of the film and her death at the hands of the zombies is appropriately grisly.

Their is a pretty good amount of graphic violence and gore throughout the film, especially for an R-rated film. The MPAA hadn't started cracking down on horror films like they began to in just a few years and as a result ROTLD features more carnage than you might expect. But I still felt that the movie could have used a bit more gore as some of the kills happen slightly off-screen or a victim will just disappear in a swarm of zombies. There still is enough here to please gorehounds though.

The zombie makeup is also pretty good and just wait until you see the zombie dubbed Tar-Man in most horror circles. He is truly a show-stopper!

The direction is also quite good. This was the first directing effort for Dan O'Bannon. Up until this point he had made a name for himself by being a co-writer on the 1974 John Carpenter film Dark Star as well as writing the 1979 classic Alien directed by Ridley Scott. He also wrote a couple of the segments in the animated short-story anthology Heavy Metal from 1981 as well as 1983's Blue Thunder. For a relatively low budget film with a budget of only about 4 million, he made the film look quite polished throughout.

Dan O'Bannon displays a natural touch to the material and strikes an almost perfect balance between the comedy and the horror. This is most apparent during the first hour or so. An unsuspecting viewer will be getting shocked and disgusted while also laughing at the absurdity of the situations at the same time.

The ROTLD series has seen 2 sequels to date. The 2nd one was wretched but the 3rd one is more of a stand alone film that actually works quite well. But nothing will be able to touch the first ROTLD. It's got gore, lots of gratuitous nudity, tons of laughs and plenty of genuine scares. What more could a horror fan ask for?

The recent DVD of this film from MGM is absolutely fantastic. First of all, the film has been digitally remastered and looks better than it probably ever has. Colors are great and the nighttime scenes display just a hint of grain. Instead of remastering the audio in Dolby Digital, MGM just touched up the original mono-soundtrack which admittedly sounds just fine. The film is presented in it's original anamorphic matted 1.85:1 theatrical ratio on side A and a open matte full screen version on side B. While I normally always prefer widescreen versions of films, this is an extremely rare case where I actually prefer the full frame version which loses just a tiny bit of picture information on the sides. You gain a very small amount of picture on the sides for the widescreen version and you lose quite a bit of picture information on the top and bottom. I guess all the years of watching it on full-frame VHS makes me more comfortable with the full frame version. There are also a few instances where the full frame version also displays a little bit more gore and nudity in various scenes on the bottom of the frame versus the widescreen transfer which blocks some of this out. Due to the complete lack of boom mic in the full frame version, I would think that they may filmed the movie with the intentions of it being full frame and just matted it down for the theatrical run.

Of particular mention is the full length commentary track with writer/director Dan O'Bannon and production designer William Stout. While there are a few dead spots and a couple of instances where they are just saying what's happening on screen, they also give out quite a bit of useful information about making the film and how it came to be. Definitely worth a listen for fans of the film.

There is also about a 10 minute featurette with interviews with Dan O'Bannon and William Stout that gives even more insight into the making of the film. Another brief featurette where William Stout shows off someof his original drawings and designs for the zombies in the film.

Rounding it all out are the usual assortments of theatrical and T.V. trailers.

I picked this up for only 9.99 brand new when it came out on DVD in 2002 and I applaud MGM for giving this film the proper treatment it deserves. Great picture quality and a good selection of supplements make this one a steal for fans of the film or horror fans just wanting to see how a horror-comedy should be done right.

Return of the Living Dead is rated R and contains graphic violence, gore, nudity and language.",1131408000,4,11306,4.557142857142857
380575,5,6301932420,"As I sit here trying to write a review for one of my favorite horror movies, I can't help but wonder what I can say that hasn't already been said about this cult classic. It's no mystery that as far as zombie flicks go, many b-movie enthusiasts will tell you ""Return"" is undoubtedly one of the best. I dare go a step further and state that it's my favorite zombie movie of all time. Of course, I love Romero's trilogy as much as the next guy and Fulci's movies I can appreciate for what they are, but ""Return of the Living Dead"" still manages to make my top list of cheesy, fun, horror b-movies.

The movie manages to capture your interest even before it actually starts. ""The events portrayed in this film are all true. The names are real names of real people and real organizations"". Those are the two phrases you're greeted with the moment you put the movie in your player. I was somewhat taken aback by this when I saw the movie for the first time, and wasn't sure if I should've taken this thing seriously or not. Of course when the movie's over you can't help but smile at everything and you'll realize that those few greeting words are part of the whole joke; but I still think it was a cool addition. A horror movie self-proclaiming itself that it is based on true events will sub-consciously capture your interest much more quickly and is prone to scare you much more easily. Just look at such surprise horror hits like the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Blair Witch Project""; then take a close look at their advertising campaign. ""Return of the Living Dead"" is no exception, and even if the events are completely fictitious, you'd still somehow find yourself more interested to find out how the story will unfold.

Obviously one cannot talk about a zombie movie without comparing it one way or the other to Romero's genre-defining ""Night of the Living Dead"". And in case we forget the film's source of inspiration, one of the main characters promptly makes a direct reference to Romero in the first few minutes of the movie. ""Did you see that movie ""Night of the Living Dead""?"" he asks his co-worker, before going on to explain that the film was based on a true incident. Despite all this, it's safe to say that ""Return"" bares very little resemblance to Romero's movies. Dan O'Bannon's film still deals with zombies, but even the zombies themselves are totally different from what Romero had originally envisioned. Romero's living dead were scary for various reasons, most notably because of their creepy look and the static, almost mechanical motion. All of this was also topped by the scary thought that amongst all the dead rising from the grave, there could also be one of your beloved deceased relatives; hence making the whole concept even creepier. In ""Return"", O'Bannon pushed the envelope even further by making the zombies the true stars of the film and giving them a comedic aspect. Because let's face it; no matter how scary looking Romero's zombies might be, even a blindfolded cripple would probably outrun them. This is however not the case in ""Return"". Here the zombies are capable of running, of talking, and even of planning their strategy to attract more prey to their whereabouts. Of course you have to suspend some disbelief in all of this, knowing that the dead's rotting muscles shouldn't move as flexibly as they do, but hey, this is a cult movie. If you can accept the fact that the dead can come back to life thanks to acid rain, you should accept everything that is thrown at you. In movies like this one, not only should you suspend disbelief, but also enjoy all the corny effects and situations. That's why many of us love cult movies so much in the first place.

And speaking of effects, you can't really get more corny than some of those found in ""Return"". Of particular interest is the skeleton head rising up from the grave. The wires used to pull the skeleton's mouth wide open are so easily visible that it's hilarious and almost embarrassing to watch. Not to mention the fact that there's no way that a skeleton would still have his eyes perfectly preserved. It's something totally unrealistic when you think about it, but hey, so are the skeletons with no eyes playing the flute and walking around with no problem whatsoever in Sam Raimi's ""Army of Darkness"". The corny effects in ""Return"" also manage to entertain because the movie is mostly played for laughs. It is a zombie film which manages to be more funny than scary. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, especially when a film proves to be this much fun. You rarely see a horror movie with the dead rising from the grave and 45 Grave's ""Party Time"" blasting in the background. Nor is it that common to see a movie with a bunch of guys battling a horde of zombies to the rhythm of the Cramps' ""Surfin' Dead"". Add to the mix a hot chick who's practically naked for most of her screen-time without no apparent reason whatsoever, and you've practically got b-movie heaven.

The movie's ending is also worth a mention, since it has its fair share of brilliance. In some respects, it vaguely reminds me of the ending to ""Night of the Living Dead"", and although it's not as dark as Romero's ending, it doesn't fall into the tired routine of ""good guys win, bad guys lose"". The explosion at the end is particularly eye-candy, and features some of the few instances of good special effects which the movie can occasionally boast of. And in case we would forget that the movie should not be taken seriously, the director promptly adds a little cool bonus to the closing credits which feature all the movie's funniest moments. To briefly summarize my endless ramblings, I fully recommend this film to any reader out there who's particularly fond of horror b-movies.

Co-written and directed by Dan O'Bannon (Alien, Dead & Buried, Blue Thunder), the film features an excellent cast including Clu Gulager (McQ, A Force of One), James Karen (Poltergeist, Apt Pupil, Superman Returns), Don Calfa (Chopper Chicks in Zombietown, Weekend at Bernie's), and Thom Mathews (Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, Alien from L.A.).  Also appearing is Beverly Randolph, John Philbin (The New Kids, Point Break), Jewel Shepard (Hollywood Hot Tubs), Miguel A. Nez Jr. (Friday the 13th: A New Beginning, Carnosaur 2), scream queen Linnea Quigley (Creepozoids, Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama), Mark Venturini, who sadly passed away in 1996, and Brian Peck, the only actor to appear in all three Return of the Living Dead films.

As the film begins, we find ourselves at the Uneeda Medical Supply company `You need it...we got it'.  It's Freddie's (Mathews) first day as a stockboy, and co-worker Frank (Karen) is showing him the ropes, along with the prosthetics, bedpans, skeletons, and yes, cadavers (man, they weren't kidding about having what I need, particularly in a nice bedpan).  A curious Freddie inquires as to what's the weirdest thing Frank has ever seen during his long tenure at the company to which Frank relates a fantastic tale about how some years ago, a chemical created a chemical for the military that had a strange side effect, namely, it brought the dead back to life.  The resulting mess was cleaned up, and the reanimated corpses were stuffed into sealed containers.  Many of the supposedly true events were then turned into a film that we know as George Romero's Night of the Living Dead (nice acknowledgement), although a number of facts were changed to avoid litigation.  Anyway, due to a military snafu, some of the containers were accidentally shipped to Uneeda, and have been sitting in the basement ever since, undisturbed...until now...while showing Freddie the containers, Frank slaps the side of one, a seal breaks, and the gas squirts out all over the two men knocking them out, and also into the air ducts, which, in turn, revives the corpsicle in the freezer.  The boys begin to freak, and decide to call the owner Burt (Gulager), figuring he'll know what to do...after some debating, then end up hacking the lively decedent into parts, stuffing the parts into garbage bags, taking said bags across the street to the crematorium and asking the resident mortician Ernie Kaltenbrunner (Calfa), who Burt's been friends with for a long time (get it?  Burt and Ernie?  Ah well...) to burn the evidence.  Ernie finally agrees, and the parts do burn into ash, but an unforeseen result is the smoke from the burning of the body is released through the chimney.  This, coupled with the quickly approaching thunderstorm, causes the fumes to seep into the ground, causing a...reaction among the long dormant residents of the graveyard, the same graveyard Freddie's friends are hanging out at while waiting for Freddie to get off work...well, I think you can put two and two together and surmise, like the South, the dead shall rise again, and they do...and they're hungry...for juicy, juicy brains...

I think this is a great movie, for someone who can appreciate it...one of the best aspects of the film are the colorful and distinctive characters, played very well by the actors.  There isn't a whole lot of development, but they're still interesting enough to keep you watching.  Perhaps my favorite character of the film was that of Burt, the boss and owner of the medical supply company played by Clu Gulager.  His pragmatism played off extremely well off the exponentially growing horror of the animated corpses, and created a sort of bizarre sense that he was more worried about how all this was going to affect business, rather than for his own mortality.  Eventually he does realize the grievous nature of the situation, but up until then it was pretty funny, particularly because he didn't overplay it...my favorite scene involved the sequence after Burt and the boys hacked up the spastic corpse and then brought it across the street to the mortuary, in an effort to get Burt's friend Ernie to get rid of everything by burning it up in his crematorium.  At first Burt tries to explain the wiggling bags as a shipment of rabid weasels, rather than tell Ernie the truth.  After awhile, and many questions from Ernie, Burt finally does come clean, but his initial attempts at subterfuge are hilarious.  A couple of other great performances are given by James Karen as Frank, the long time warehouse employee seeming happy to have a new apprentice, even to the point of showing off a little, and Don Calfa as Ernie, the gun toting mortician who develops a scientific interest in the corpses.  Thom Mathews also did very well, especially near the end of the picture, as the sickness from inhaling the noxious gas earlier finally overtakes him.  The walking dead were much more lively and active in this film, more so than I had seen in films previous, which added a nice spin to the notion that the reanimated dead are only capable of lumbering about.  In terms of special effects and make up, the detail in the corpses was most excellent, especially that half woman corpse the group captures and Ernie questions in the latter half of the movie.  Also, the Tarman corpse, the one that was released from the military container, was exquisitely detailed and the actor who played the part had his movements down perfectly, or at least in terms of how I thought a recently released from his barrel, rotting, festering, slimy corpse would move about.  Everything worked so well together here, the directing, the script, quotable dialog, the humor, the nasty bits, the acting, all tied together with a carefully chosen soundtrack featuring bands like, among others, T.S.O.L, The Damned, The Flesheaters, Roky Erickson, and The Cramps.  All in all, a completely harmonious balance and truly fun entertainment for the sick and twisted.  Oh yeah, there's a couple of great nekkid bits featuring Jewel Shepard, who plays a punky girl obsessed with all things gruesome and morbid.

This DVD release features both the widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, along with a fullscreen version, both looking sharp and clean.  The Dolby Digital audio also comes through very well and clear.  As far as special features, there is an audio commentary track with director Dan O'Bannon and production designer William Stout (I was kinda surprised they didn't get any of the actors involved), along with a featurette titled `Designing the Dead' (13:37), conceptual artwork by William Stout, TV spots, and both an G rated and R rated trailers for the film.

380580,3,6301932420,"Plot: When toxic chemicals that reanimate dead bodies are accidentally pumped into the air, contaminating the rain (which soaks a graveyard), corpses come back to life and seek living victims. A small group of people must try to fight them off. But as the number of dead bodies grow, it seems that this is, in many ways, the end. How long can these humans survive before becoming just another pile of ""braaaaaaaaains""?

The Negatives: I had expected The Return Of the Living Dead to be a zombie flick that was so silly it could be considered a comedy (like a ""black comedy"", as most people would refer to it). However, although there is an obvious lack of seriousness, I felt that there wasn't really anything to separate it from any other cheesy zombie flick. It wasn't quite silly enough to be a comedy, yet wasn't frightening enough to be considered horror. I had a few small laughs, but for the most part, there really wasn't that much fun poked at the living dead and the movies that feature them.

The Positives: The question might be, ""If not humor, then maybe outrageous gore or some good 'ol zombie action would make this film worth watching?"" Well, there isn't a whole lot of gore, but there are some pretty nifty corpses. Not only do we see the average mutilated bodies to make up the walking dead, but also a few gooey skeleton monsters that are, sadly, rarely seen in movies anymore. This would probably be the main reason to see this -- a few good corny zombie scenes. Another positive aspect is, believe it or not, a surprise ending! It may not be the most clever one in the world, but I sure didn't see it coming.

To make a long review short, most zombie fans have seen much worse movies than this. The Return Of The Living Dead is worth a look for any living dead fan, but I'd still strongly advise a rental before purchase. Three and a half stars for some good ol cheesy fun, nonetheless.",1124064000,,1907,4.489913544668588
380581,5,6301932420,"I just saw ROTLD for the first time the other nite and I have 2 say I was really impressed. I was always under the impression that it was some kind of campy horror/comedy spoof that had somewhat of a cult following. In my experience ""cult"" is usually synonymous with ""crap."" I don't think something can be unintentionally funny, or ""so bad it's good."" Crap is crap.

This is not the case with ROTLD. Don't get me wrong, the movie is most definitely low budget, but the acting is decent, the special effects are impressive, and the writing is better than a lot of the ""blockbusters"" out these days. The dialouge is engaging and none of the characters do anything incredibly stupid. The most interesting part is that some of the characters show some genuine curiosity as to what it is they are dealing with. They try to understand what a zombie is, which would be the first logical step in fighting it. Plus there is some nice T&A.

The worst thing I can say about this film is the ending. They must have run out of money or something because it felt completely rushed. They even recycled some footage form earlier in the film!",1123459200,4,1125,4.482926829268293

So they burn the zomie but it rains and bring other corpses back to life how will they(and a couple of punks who are caught in the middle of this) kill the zombies and get out alive?

GORE: This movie isn't as gory as Dawn of the Dead or Day of the dead but there is some gore here. The way Suicide gets killed is pretty gruesome and everytime somebody dies you can count on alot of bloodshed. What this movie lacks in gore it makes up with humour. I laugh everytime Burt mentions ""rabid weasles"" to Earnie or when Frank beats up on the split dog with a crutch.

Nudity: Trash is pretty much nude all the way through the movie(even when she's a zombe!). And there are ALOT of pictures of naked girls in the building where Freddy and Frank work at.",1122163200,,1100,4.387254901960785

The movie starts as two guys crack open a container that had a zombie in it from the 1968 outbreak. Of course, this leads to zombie infestation mania! Even dogs cut in half, who are in the warehouse where the container breaks, come back to life!

My favorite part has to be the scene where the zombies are having a huge feast on the paramedics and police who have arrived to the rescue only to have their flesh ripped off, and one zombie gets on the police radio and says ""Send more BRAAAAAAAAAAAINS!"" Ha ha! That's the best ever!

Yes, in this movie, zombies can talk, and they don't die by destroying the brain.

It even has teens partying in a cemetery and a chick voluntarily taking off her clothes off just because she feels like it.

The only part I really didn't like about the movie was turning the virus into an airborn deal instead of a fluid swap, but it's what makes the movie was it is.

380594,5,6301932420,"Return of the Living Dead is a well-made tribute to George Romero's Night of the Living Dead films. In fact ROTLD is loosely based around the events in Romero's 1968 classic. It turns out that after the nerve toxin disaster in 1968, the U.S. government shipped the sealed poisonous gas to a warehouse in Kentucky. Two late night employees at the warehouse inadvertently release the fues into the atmosphere, and things are soon back to square one.

George Romero's films were always known to contain social messages and agendas. In Night of the Living Dead, Romero chose an African-American character as the main protagonist (an event unheard of in those days). Return of the Living Dead follows in this tradition with Miguel Nunez's character serving as the essential leader of the punk rock gang. Dawn of the Dead critiqued the excessiveness of American consumerism, and also provided a critique of racism early in the film. Return of the Living Dead does not critique consumerism, but it does take a shot at the government and military - subtly suggesting that society can truly trust neither.

Return of the Living Dead has become a cult classic for several reasons. The acting is very good, with Clu Gulager giving a tremendous performance as the boss of the warehouse. Special effects are outstanding, with the most impressive being a basement-dwelling zombie covered in mud. The soundtrack is also phenomenal and helps drive the film. I usually do not care for punk rock, but it works well in Return of the Living Dead and certainly helps give the movie a certain style. The eerie music that plays during the title sequence always pumps me up - very spooky and very 80's at the same time. The graveyard and isolated warehouse setting also help convey an eerie atmosphere as well.

The DVD version of the film is quite good. There are several extras, including director's commentary, two different trailers, and a feature titled ""Designing the Dead"" which shows the original artwork that was used in creating the various zombies. Also, I'm glad to see that MGM decided to use the original poster artwork as the cover for the DVD case (the airbrushed painting of three zombies standing by a tombstone).

Return of the Living Dead isn't a pure horror film. It's got scary moments, but I think I would classify it more as a comedy. You need to see this movie if you are a zombie fan.",1114473600,4,2386,4.798053527980535
380595,5,6301932420,"This movie is a late night classic. I remember watching the VHS with my dad when I was a kid and I still enjoy it the same when I watched it the first time. Its not a movie that you should just watch any time you should save it for that special occassion and time. Like a saturday night (if you don't have anything else to do Im sorry) or with someone that is really squimish or scary themselves. I always enjoy a movie like this much more with someone who is deathly afraid of them.  Especially when you know whats coming and they don't and you scare the sh&t out of them. You know.

Movies like this aren't made anymore even though somehave been okay (TCM remake very good & dawn of the dead as well) but this movie has what those others don't the feel of a classic old horror flick no special effects and just a fan of B movie's dream or nightmare which ever you prefer.

My favorite part (besides the girl in the graveyard...fellas you know )is and my friends agree is when the zombie in the basement is chomping down on the first victim and he turns and sees the kids and says ""Brains....MORE Brains !!"". That part is creepy and gets me everytime I don't care how many times I've seen it that part is great. The title of my review was the best line in this movie. If you have seen the movie you know what I am talking about if you haven't buy it then agree with my review and click yes this review was helpful.

380596,5,6301932420,"I have to say that this has to be one of the best Zombie flicks out there! And I really find myself surprised to see myself typing this, as I am a hardcore Romero junky, and typically prefer the serious tone of his movies, as well as the social comments, not to mention his entire Zombie mythology.

 Unlike a Romero film, these Zombies retain a LOT more information from there previous life. Not only that, but they don't die, even if you remove and destroy the head, they can run, they can talk, they can figure out puzzles, etc.

 Another thing is this movie has an early 80's Goth/Punk sound track, featuring the Th Jet Black Berries, The Cramps, 45 Grave, and The Damned among others. Typically I prefer a more ambient moody cEvin Keyish sound scape sort of sound track with my horror movies, but in ROTLD's case, the Goth/Punk is PERFECT! It really brings me back to the days before all this Mary Manson garbage. :(

 Anyhow, the movie as a sence of humor, yet still delivers PURE shock factor! Well at lest when I was young, it scared the piss out of me like NO OTHER film! I swear, myself and every kid I ever met that was exposed to this film at a young age of 9 or so when it came out, stayed up late many nights watching out for Zomnies. The presentation really sticks with you in ways that not even the Ghouls in Ghouls, or the Infected in 28 Days later the Zombies of the Dawn remake could possibly do. The effects were VERY good for the time, and I feel still stand as a testament as to why computer animation still lacks that certain tangible aspect.

Anyhow, check it out, but don't worry so much about the sequals though, unless you don't mind degraded effects, plot, and character presentation, not to mention an added B-Rate comic book appeal.

This film was shot in 1.33:1. You see back in the early 80's a lot of low budget films were shot in that ratio because the filmmakers figured ""Hey, the movie will be in theaters for 6-8 weeks and then Home Video will be its residing place for the rest of eternity."" What they could not predict was that in the late 20th century film buffs would become such ardent film collectors that they would demand their favorite films be released AS THEY WERE SHOT. Well MGM, when releasing The Return of the Living Dead, must have worried that its fans would MISTAKENLY think that they were not getting the film in its original format unless the DVD contained a WIDESCREEN version. So MGM slapped black bars on the top and bottom of the film(That's right, it's not any wider than the STANDARD version)and called it ""WIDESCREEN"". MGM, and all other film studios should realize that film fans don't care how WIDE a film is, they just want their films presented in their original format.

The original ""Night of the Living Dead"", although not a bad film, was a little boring, one could easily dose off if one didn't have enough sleep while watching it.  In fact, I've found most of the early living dead films that way.  This movie, on the other hand, rocks.  Its punked up and the dead are back to party.  It involves a medical supply wharehouse, the employees there, some punks who like to party in the cemetary, a mortuary, the mortician and a lot of hungry dead people.

If you didn't know, brains are what the dead are hungry for.  The dead in this picture aren't stupid either.  They seem to know just how to get a hold of more brains to munch on.  They talk, they walk (some have a little problem with this), they run , they know how to gang tackle, and they eat brains.

380633,5,6301932420,"Flesh-rending, brain-eating, and punk rock. Horror? Maybe to you; to me it sounds like a great night out.

And make no mistake about it: brain-chomping has never been so cool since the glory days of ""Return of the Living Dead"", Dan O'Bannon's first foray into directing (he wrote the script for ""Alien"" and later helmed the underrated ""The Resurrected"") and an homage to Romero's classic zombie films that would come close---very close---to surpassing the works of the Master in their ghoulish, brain-chomping goodness.

Remember that movie they made, years ago, about the living dead wandering about rural Pennsylvania, hungry for human flesh? Well, turns out that's a true story---but according to medical device factory supervisor Frank (played by the immortal James Karen, who sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for being in every cool film ever made), They (you know, the Army, the Pentagon, the CIA, the Scientists, the Guys in Charge) made the filmmakers change names and places around a little.

As it turns out, Frank confides in rookie co-worker Freddy (played to the hilt by then-newcomer Thom Mathews), the army transported some of the zombies to a little medical products plant in Louisville, Kentucky---why, the very medical products plant our two heroes are sitting in. The zombies, of course, are downstairs in special sealed containment barrels.

Could you resist? Frank and Freddy can't, and head downstairs for a little face time with the safely entombed zombie. Turns out those old Army Corps of Engineering barrels weren't nearly as fail-safe as Frank thought, and a nasty, greenish, zombifying gas pours out---and it has very specific, re-animating qualities. Seeing as the gas spreads quickly through a building stocked to the gills with cadavers and split-dogs (just see for yourself), this is a very bad thing.

Add to this Frank and Freddy's decision with the help of an eccentric mortician Ernie (was that a Horst Wessel tune playing on his headphones while he was embalming that corpse?) to burn the zombified evidence (smoke spreads the pollutants, guys...to the local cemetery), throw in a pack of punkers who decide to 'hang out' in the aforementioned cemetery, and you have the makings of what I consider to be one of the very best zombie movies *ever* made.

""Return of the Living Dead"" is sick, funny, benefits from a great eighties punker score (including songs from The Cramps and SSQ), well-paced, beautifully shot and rippingly directed by O'Bannon: not content to rest on its hysterically funny laurels, the movie ups the ante by really try to scare the dog collar off you.

Yes, the ""Wee Chapel of the Dawn"" is a whimsical and truly funny touch, as is the eviscerated woman's corpse, strapped to a gurney in the mortuary, that howls ""brains...brains...BRAINS""---but the gallows humor is tied to the horror, and ""Return of the Living Dead"", even all these years later, is a terrifying film. The dead here don't amble or lurch, they run---and they talk, yell, taunt and scream, as well (""I love you Tina...and that's why you need to let me EAT YOUR BRAINS"").

The special edition DVD is sorely needed, and restores ""Return"" to all its brain chewing glory. The extras, including a wry and amusing commentary by O'Bannon and conceptual art of the undead, are worth the price of admission alone.

Make sure you've secured all the doors and windows, locked and loaded your streetsweeper, don that spiked dog-collar, put a cassette of The Cramps in the hopper, and keep just two things in mind:

1) Shoot those mangy zombies in the head; and

2) It's a lifestyle, baby!

movie,I completly disagree.

I have to say in writing this review i am bias. ROTLD is my

all favorite zombie movie(yes even beating dawn and night)

 Why might you ask?Well let me tell you.

First it has everything you need Zombies,an 80s punk gang,hot

punk chicks,good soundtrack and of course some great special

effects and gore.

Second the script is actually good! In a fun zombie way of corpse. Its about a teenager who goes to work for a place that

sells corpses to hospitals and schools. Upon his arrival the

boss shows him a container housing a creature that was supposedly a zombie. Well needless to say they crack the container and all zombie hell breaks loose. Tie this in with

partying and a cemetary and you have a all around great movie.

Third-It has running zombies! One thing i have always loved

about this movie was the fact that the zombies charged after

people. They were not afraid to try something differant and it worked.

movie. If you're looking for zombies and fun look no further.",1101081600,3,1137,4.46829268292683
380635,5,6301932420,"""Return Of The Living Dead"" is basically one giant homage to George Romero's infamous ""Night Of The Living Dead,"" and a loving one at that. It pokes plenty of fun at the horror genre, is stocked with stupid characters, and has plentiful helpings of gore. During his first day on the job at Uneeda Medical Supplies, Freddy (Tom Mathews, you may remember him as Tommy Jarvis in ""Friday the 13th, pt. VI: ""Jason Lives"") and his bumbling supervisor, Frank (James Karen), accidentally crack a tank containing a corpse that was previously a zombie (ala ""Night Of The Living Dead""). Problem is, this tank was filled with toxic gasses, and not only does it make the two very ill, every dead creature in the building comes back to life (even some split puppies (?)). Up until this point, there is only one zombie to worry about, until the two decide to cremate it, which spreads more gasses into the air and re-awakens the dead all over town. Big mess. And caught in the middle of it all are a really obnoxious group of teenagers, coincidentally, Freddy's friends (one of whom stays nude pretty much for her entire screen-time, problem is, she's one of the first to go) and some very unlucky and downright stupid paramedics. From here on out, it follows standard zombie flick procedure, with an abundance of shocks and laughs thrown everywhere, all capped off with a surprising ending that will leave you scratching your head and wondering what you just saw. Nevertheless, ""Return Of The Living Dead"" is pure fun.

Running Time:  91 minutes.
Rated R for violence, gore, nudity, and language.
Poking fun at George A. Romeo's ""Night of the Living Dead"" series, this campy-style horror romp is undoubtedly some of the most fun you will have watching a scary movie.  Director Dan O'Bannon uses just the right balance of sheer terror and humor, combining elements from Romeo's ""Dawn of the Dead"" and Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"".  ""Return of the Living Dead"" is a zombie flick for hairbangers, with dead people running around searching for human blood and brains while to the soundtrack of rock music.
A small Virginia town is terrorized by zombies when a chemical spill accidentally resurrects those buried in a nearby cemetary.  The blood-crazed zombies are in search of human brains, for it feeds the addiction caused by the unknown chemicals.  Clu Gulager and James Karen give good, quirky performances, but Thom Matthews steals the show.  Although not a revolutionary film, ""Return of the Living Dead"" has superb makeup effects, a rocking musical score, and a satiral script that will bring out more than a few chuckles.

as for the rest...well the text of the back of the case is pretty wrong because freddy doesn't work at an army surplus store. the tv spots are pretty much the same and alter the details of when the movie is going to be released. you can tell this movie wasn't given the respect it deserved. but still...i give it a 4 instead of a 3 because it's 'return of the living dead' and its actually being released again. i can only hope one day someone will release a copy of the original and add all the cool stuff that was in the work print.",1085529600,,1633,4.220447284345048

380674,4,6301932420,"""Over the top"" doesn't even begin to describe this film.  It's a rare movie that works as a satire of a beloved genre (NIGHT & DAWN OF THE DEAD) and stands more or less alone as a credible horror movie on its own.  Unlike something like SCARY MOVIE, which has  no pretensions of telling a serious story amidst all the humor, this one is a great zombie movie first, and a gentle parody second.
Set primarily in a medical supply warehouse, a funeral home and a graveyard (how's that for a trifecta of great locations!), we follow the story of what happens when a long hidden government ""nerve agent"" is released and it turns out it has the power to reanimate the dead.  And I don't mean intact corpses.  It raises body parts, including, memorably, the remains of a dog that was cut in half (for classroom purposes).  The shot of the poor creature, normal on one side and organ's exposed on the other, trying to run, sticks with you.  It's disturbing, gross, funny and totally original.
The movie ups the ante with these zombies too.  They CAN'T be killed with a shot to the head.  In fact, nothing short of totally burning them up in a crematorium does the trick.  When warehouse owner Clu Gallagher shows up at the funeral home with a pile of twitching plastic bags, that is a GREAT, grisly moment.  Another great touch was having the two characters who breathed in the agent directly (when they were still alive) go straight from being alive to being zombies without all that annoying dieing stuff!  The paramedics examine the shivering, but conscious and coherent men, only to discover they have NO heartbeat or blood pressure.  Cool idea!
The movie is mostly populated with a bunch of obnoxious teenagers partying at the cemetary.  They are the barest caricatures (but funny, because they are caricatures of early '80s teenagers!), and not terribly interesting.  The characters we actually care anything about are the older actors.  James Karen, as the warehouse manager, is particularly great.  His overacting is epic, and yet fits the tone of the film PERFECTLY.  It's a comic / horror gem.
The movie features a loud rock score...with some truly terrible songs.  And one of the characters, whose name I forget, is a pink haired girl with a death wish, who apparently likes to stip all her clothes off and strut around for hours.  So in the midst of all the gore, we also have lengthy full frontal nudity.  So if you don't mind your kids seeing crazy zombie violence and brain-eating...you might still shy away from the graphic nudity.  I'm not sure the movie could get an ""R"" anymore these days.
If you haven't seen it, you should probably check out at least NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD first, just so the conventions being poked fun at are fully appreciated.  But if you are a fan of those movies, this is the movie for you!
The extras on the DVD are really just a fairly detailed but actually not terribly interesting making-of documentary.  I'm sorry, but lovingly telling us about the costume design for this film just doesn't do much for me.",1080172800,5,3068,4.638888888888889

Freddy is new, so Frank has fun showing him the skeletons, split-dogs, and the hanging cadaver in the freezer. Frank simply must show Freddy the strange containers in the basement, containing corpses from a chemical spill. He explains that these drums were mistakenly sent to Uneeda by the military. One of the containers springs a leak, causing the noxious gas within to spray out. Frank and Freddy wake up on the floor, next to a now empty container. Thus begins this little tale of terror.

Back at Uneeda, Frank and Freddy encounter re-animated split-dogs and a screaming cadaver in the freezer, causing them to call their boss Burt (Clu Gulager) for help. Burt arrives and the three chuckleheads try unsuccessfully to ""kill"" the screeching, running cadaver. They end up having to cut it into several squirming pieces. This leads Burt to ask a favor of his buddy Ernie, next door at the Resurrection funeral home and crematorium. Outside, Trash (Linnea Quigley) decides to tear her clothes off and dance around the graveyard.

380677,4,6301932420,"""Return of the Living Dead"" is not meant to be taken seriously as a zombie movie.  It is instead a rock and roll comedy that keeps the yuks coming while holding the bloody gore to a relative minimum.  Some of the characters may be over-the-top cliches (especially the teenagers), but for the most part the actors do the Leslie Neilson-""The Naked Gun"" deadpan well enough to generate laughs.  The movie's other strength is the design of the Dead themselves, which were based on real-life mummies and are actually quite chilling to look at.  The plot is somewhat silly, of course, but at least it doesn't insult the intelligence.  It should also be mention that ""ROTLD"" originated the famous ""Brains!"" chant of the zombies that would be so cleverly pariodied on ""The Simpsons.""

380720,4,6301932420,"Upon hearing the title, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, the first thought most people probably have is that RETURN is a sequel to George Romero's beloved classic, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. While it's easy to see why one would assume such a thing that is not the case. RETURN is, instead, a sort of spoof on the zombie genre that came about when the creators of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (George Romero and John Russo) parted ways. You see both men agreed that they could each use the LIVING DEAD titles as they wished. Romero, as most zombie enthusiasts already know, went on to create his zombie trilogy (including DAY OF THE DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD), while Russo went on to create this and it's sequel, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD PART II. So what does that make RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD?
RETURN OF EH LIVING DEAD is a gory comedy that will entertain you from start to finish. It'll make you laugh and, at the same time, terrified to go outside for the fear of zombies charging at you from out of the darkness. Admittedly a huge fan of the zombie genre, (and not as big of fan of Romero's final two films in the dead trilogy as the majority of zombie lovers), I think RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is a fun horror comedy equipped with corny dialogue, black humor, a fair amount of gore, and the most gratuitous nudity I've ever seen in a film. While the RETURN films have understandably been endlessly compared to Romero's films, I think they are really both two totally separate groups of solid zombie films. You see, Romero's films are all about mood and gore and even some drama while RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is a fast paced joke of a movie and I mean that as a compliment. While both Romero's films and the ROTD films feature zombies, Romero uses them for scares and to conjure up human emotions while ROTD (this one and the second one) uses them to eat the brains of punk rockers and to make us laugh.
All in all, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, is the perfect movie to sit around and watch with your friends and a case of beer (maybe even a bottle of Jagermeister?).

380722,3,6301932420,"""Return Of The Living Dead"" is one of those horror gems that hardcore fans have wanted to see on DVD. A fun old-fashioned horror film that has been out of print on VHS for awhile, ""Return"" is not related to George Romero's ""Dead"" series. It is more or less a parody of the Living Dead films before it. Written and directed by Dan O'Bannon, this 1985 cult classic is an excellent mixture of horror and comedy. Unfortunately, the DVD falls short of some fan's expectations in a few areas.
The picture quality is superb. You get both the widescreen and full-frame versions of the film but the sound mix leaves something to be desired. The original soundtrack has been altered during some scenes (perhaps for copyright reasons) so some songs are absent altogether. This really hurts the DVD all around. Not only that but you don't get too many special features on the DVD. There is a nice collection of trailers & TV spots and an audio commentary from O'Bannon which doesn't get too insightful as far as elements of the story are concerned. You hear more from O'Bannon the director than you do from the writer. It would have been good to hear him comment more on the story as opposed to how he got certain things to look a certain way. Especially since we already get a featurette where he comments on the visual style of the movie. While we're making wishes, it would have been good to have a few more featurettes that help cover the behind-the-scenes stuff.
With this DVD, we get a little better than many of these DVD's which give you nothing but the movie and sometimes the trailer but even with the little bit of special treatmant it gets, it still seems to be treated like an ""unwanted child"". There are a lot of people who have begged for either a ""director's cut"" or deleted scenes with a rumored alternate ending. As someone who loves and appreciates this underrated film, I was expecting more. Don't ask me why but this DVD seems to come up short. It really killed it when they removed some of the familiar music numbers in the movie. I still love this movie and am grateful that they released it in this format but I am still hoping to eventually see a ""special edition"" down the road.",1061683200,5,2192,4.510050251256281

(""The movie lied!?!"", exclaims one of the characters), and when they run,not shamble.
  Yeah it has an 80's look and atmosphere, but who cares if they have tape decks instead of CD players, or the computer has a deathray green screen(like so many American elementary schools of the Reagan 80's)? The movie's still fun!",1049846400,,576,4.74

I liked the zombie in the basement the way he looked sent chills down my spine. Also the girl that got naked had made a wish that men would bite her and eat away at her.  Well she got her wish.  It was funny to watch them run away in terror.  I like the part when the zombie pretended to be a cop and was directing all the cops towards him and the other zombies jumped out the bushes and got all the cops.

Both Return of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead by George Romero were released the same year and there hasn't been a GOOD zombie movie made since with the exception of Dead Alive in 1993.  Return of the Living Dead contains the perfect blend of comedy, horror, and gore.  Couple that with a cast of a few pretty decent actors and you have a winner which is exactly what this movie is!  It all starts when an unknown chemical (unknown until part 3 which was really lame) that has the ability to reanimate the dead is released in a medical supply warehouse and, well, reanimates a cadaver as well as some split dogs.  They take the cadaver, by now cut into pieces, to a crematory across the street that is operated by a friend of the owner of the medical supply warehouse and convince him to burn it for them.  The smoke releases the chemical into the air which causes it to rain and soak into the ground of the cemetery bring the dead back to life.  Throw in a group of punk kids (no really they are punks with mohawks and everything) who are hanging out at the cemetery waiting for their friend who works at the medical warehouse where it all started to get off work and you have the makings for some genuine mayhem.  Sound hokey?  Well it's not the film actually works very well and is entertaining throughout.

Waiting for their friend to get off work at a medical supply warehouse near a graveyard, a group of young punks decide to party in the graveyard.  Alright, stupid enough.  What is even stupider is their friend and his boss decide to dink around with a corpse in a barrel floating a mysterious matererial that supposedly brings the dead to life, accidentally shipped to the warehouse.  After too much horsing around, the barrel bursts, sending a mysterious gas into the air and bringing various dead bodies to life inside the plant.  After burning them in the local crematorium, rain starts bringing corpses back to life in the graveyard.  Then, things start to go bad.
This is a hilarious film with plenty of creepy moments and blood.  The sound track includes great artists like 45 Grave and The Cramps.

Director Dan O'Bannon (who also wrote the screen play and was one of the creators of characters in the original Alien) brings this re-working/homage of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead to life with gut ripping gore, a pumping punk rock soundtrack, and a wicked of a sense of humor, all of which made Return of the Living Dead an instant classic.  However, as previously mentioned by a few other reviewers, there are a few changes in the film that were not present before, but that mostly doesn't take away from the film.  Thom Matthews (Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives) and James Karen would return in the sequel.

Most horror/comedies seem to get lost lost in the comedy aspect, basically making the movies comedies(Army Of Darkness, Dead Alive, etc.  Don't get the wrong idea here, I like those too.).  One thing I love about this movie is that the acting of the main characters is superb for this kind of B film.  The cast of unknowns is extremely convincing, and the movie benefits so much from this.  James Karen is hysterical.  I tell ya, there is a scene in this film that has my nearly wetting myself every time.  The scene where Clu Gulager is sawing the head off of a restrained zombie while James Karen sobs and whines, and Clu says to him: ""Be a man, Frank, be a man!""

 Yes, Return of the Living Dead is the perfect mix of horror, hokeyness, and comedy in one heckuva fun movie. Thanks to the curiosity of two medical supply warehouse employees, the tanks that housed zombies from the ""real event"" that Romero's Night of the Living Dead was inspired by, are opened and the putrid gas is melted into the ground thanks to rain. And up come the dead! A group of misfit teens, the two employees, and another creepy looking guy who gives on the minute humour are trapped in the morgue / warehouse as the dead want their brains.
 Return of the Living Dead could have easily been misinterpreted and be thought of as a downright cheesy, useless horror flick. But I - along with many other people - find RotLD to be the definite zombie flick of the eighties. Dan O'Bannon treated us to a great flick. First off, the horror is definitely there. Suspense kicks in just as soon as the zombies rise, and you never know who's going to be next. Comedy is present, and throughout most of the film. And it's never tired. What also made RotLD interesting is, there's no one main character. There may be some more focused on, but there's no complete protagonist. The group of humans is the protagonist, and the zombies are the antagonist. Also, a great scene is with the captured half-zombie chick and her giving the explanation of why the dead do what they do. Creepy.
 Thanks to MGM for giving the fans a decent dvd release. Most of the supplements feature on the designing of the zombies and such, but they're interesting for die hard fans. The trailer and tv spots are fun to watch, but I warn that the tv spots are quite repetitive. The picture transfer is pretty good, with only a flew glitches and audio is good.
 With its perfect mix, Night of the Living Dead homages, and fun cast, Return of the Living Dead is the choice for 80s zombie movies.",1036972800,2,1997,4.520775623268698

Any genre fan who has a morbid sense of humor is sure to enjoy 1985's THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD.  In the same vein as other tongue-in-cheek horror shtick such as the Chiodo Brothers' KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE and Sam Raimi's ARMY OF DARKNESS, this one's specifically a spoof of George Romero's classic and highly revered zombie film NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  Director/Screenwriter Dan O'Bannon, probably best known for having penned the original ALIEN movie, does a fantastic job of lovingly poking fun at the Horror and SF genres while at the same time satirizing everything from the U.S. Military to Punk Rock.  This movie is not only funny, it's got plenty o' ""brains""!
And you can't beat the financial value of the DVD edition.  Not only does it cost less than a lot of other full-length, widescreen DVD thrillers--including some that are hardly worth the plastic and aluminum it took to make 'em--but it also includes these cool extras: an optional audio commentary by O'Bannon and production designer William Stout; both the G-rated and R-rated theatrical trailers; over 5-minutes of various TV spots; some storyboard-like production stills; and a really cool ""Designing the Dead"" featurette, in which O'Bannon and Stout discuss the evolution of the final look and feel of the movie (lots of great shots of Stout's EC-Comics-like designs for the zombies offered in this one).",1035763200,46,1568,5.089494163424124

We were both VERY disappointed with the comedic aspects of the film, and trashed it to anyone who would listen. Now I'm 31, and I've come to the conclusion that TROTLD is a classic. A minor classic, but a classic nonetheless.
  A semi-sequel to the legendary Night of the Living Dead (It shares the same writer), TROTLD gives us this scenario: After a chemical spill that resulted in the incident which Night of the Living Dead is based on, the Army seals up the living cadavers and ships them off for study. Being the Army, S--T happens; The cannisters are misplaced for 15 years in a Medical supply warehouse, where they are accidentally breached by two dim-bulb employees (Thom Matthews and the HILARIOUS James Karen, who provides most of the films laughs); After overcoming a re-animated frozen corpse, and being dosed with the chemical themselves, they bop over to the nearby CEMETARY (You see where this is going..?) to ask their buddy Ernie (Don Calfa) to help them cremate the dismembered bits. Soon those ashes are seeding the rainclouds, creating a downpour of zombie-makin' goodness!
  The script is lively and fun; We even get to see Zombies that run, talk, use radios to call for more victims.....Very original stuff! It's amazing to see what they were able to accomplish with such a small budget. The disc includes both standard and widescreen formats (WATCH WIDESCREEN!!!!), commentary by Director Dan O'Bannon and Production Designer William Stout, a Designing the Dead featurette, Theatrical trailers and TV spots, William Stout's gorgeous design art, and coolest of all, the box cover glows in the dark!!

380849,5,6301932420,"Well, Well, Well, here's a film that offers great brain food ... RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD.  This film was a surprise hit in August 1985 when this film was released theatrically.  I think both cops and peramedics enjoyed this film as well.
This film stars James Karen, Clu Galuger (Nightmare 2), Thom Matthews (Jason Lives : Friday the 13th Part6), scream goddess Linnea Quigley (who plays Trash in this movie), Miguel Nunez and Marc Venturini (whom both appeared in Friday the 13th Part5 - The New Beginning) and a bunch of other actors we all never heard of.
This film pays homage to Night of the Living Dead - the George A. Romero 1960 classic.  It also blends in horror along in with comedy (one of the first horror films to do it) with satisfying results.  My favourite part of this film is when Trash (Linnea Quigley) visits the Resurrection Cemetary with her friends and tells them her fantasy of dying - to be attacked by older men and eaten alive - and Trash just happens to get her wish.
This film deals with a medical worker (James Karen) and his assistant (Thom Matthews) encounter cannisters of dead cadavers, that splits open that awakes the dead and they turn to a crematorist for help - with disasterous results.  The army eventually gets involved and the dead are ready to party.
This film has a good sound mix for a film of the 80's era.  A good 80's soundtrack that is now hard to find.  A noted song in this film Tonight (We'll Make Love Till We Die) by SSQ was better known as Stacey Q who would later sign on with Atlantic Records the year later with the #2 hit ""Two of Hearts"".  Unfortunately for Stacey Q, she was a one hit wonder, made two albums and was dropped by Atlantic Records in 1990.
I have nothing but great things to say about this film and this DVD.  MGM did a great job with the transfer of this film, both piture and sound quality wise.  This film is presented in tis standard version and for the first time in widescreen (1.85:1) version.  Extras include a soundtrack commentary, a ""Featurette"" with the writer and director Dan O'Bannon, tv spots and two theatre trailers.  This film is a must have for fans of the genre and of this film.  Highly reccomended for cops and peramedics !!!!
This film and DVD is well worth the wait so do get your copy today !!!!",1031961600,8,2298,4.4299287410926365
380850,1,6301932420,"lets see where to begin, First off let me state that this movie is one of the greatest zombie movies ever made. But the DVD definatly could have been much better. They didn't even get the description on the back of the box right. Its a medical supply not an army surplus. Not to mention that if something isn't broken why would you try and fix it.
By this statement I mean that the movie was great the way that it was, why would you need to go back and change and leave things out. example: The part when the gang is riding around in the car, going to the cemetary. They play a song there, BUT its not the original song, its supposed to be The Damned, and its not. They took that song out and put another one in its place. Then they turned it up so loud that you can barely hear what the people are saying. The laugh at the beginning of the song is the same, however the rest is not.
 Also, after tina goes and find freddie and the rest of the group meets up at the warehouse in the original they are playing the tall boys song over them talking and you cant really hear all their dialouge, in the dvd version first off the song isn't even in there, (they took music and tried to make it sound like the song minus the lyrics, but it didn't fool anyone) also you can hear everything that they say to each other in the warehouse, and the dialouge at that part isn't exactly the best ever.
Then theres the part with the zombie telling the to ""send more cops"" the dvd does a very poor job of overdubbing the voice, why did it need to be fix it was perfect before.
And last, one of the best music scenes in the movie, the part when burt goes to the creamatorium, there is a really awesome song playing then that fits the scene perfectly. In the DVD, it was decided to take out the song, and now there is silence, and it doesnt compliment the scene very much.
As i said before the movie, (plot, characters, music) is very cool. And the DVD could have been much much better. I would take the 18 year old movie over the poorly made DVD anyday. The best thing about this being on DVD is that the picture is much better, but i would rather have the blurry video tape picture and have all the music and original dialouge, then have something that was remade.",1031788800,12,2247,4.14187643020595
380851,4,6301932420,"There are few movies I've looked forward to seeing on DVD more than ""Return Of The Living Dead.""  Read other reviews for raves about the movie (and it deserves them all!) but here I'm writing about the ""extras."" I couldn't wait for the features on the DVD: running commentary!  A featurette!  Production design artwork!
The artwork IS beautiful.  William Stout's design obviously had a large influence on the look of the movie.  I don't usually find the artwork features on DVDs to be very interesting, but in this case they picked such choice pieces that I was captivated.
The featurette is revealing: Stout and O'Bannon talk separately about their experiences making the film, and O'Bannon hints that he was never very happy with it.  It would have been nice to get some of the original cast involved, but they were sadly absent.
Then, the commentary.  I'm sad to say that the commentary has managed to dull my enthusiasm for the film, something I didn't think was possible.  Dan O'Bannon spends the entire time complaining about the budget, the time constraints, and his own directorial style (though he does seem quite happy about his environmental effects and -- justifiably -- with the notorious ""Tar Man."")  William Stout is much more positive and informative -- he brings up some anecdotes that are illuminating, and brings attention to pieces of scenery that I would never have noticed (that painting of the crying child!  The glued-on microphone popping off during the last scene!).  But most of the time, just as Stout is launching into something fascinating, O'Bannon instantly cuts him off with a line I grew all too familiar with: ""Today, obviously, this could have done better.  But what can you do.  We had no money.  Oh, but that fog effect looks good.""
I also found myself wondering: with all of the extra footage floating around on the ""rough edit"" tapes, and pieces of the movie altered and shot for TV broadcast, why was this extra material not included on the DVD?
Oh well, it still gets 4 stars for the beautiful transfer (you can zoom in, and zoom in, and zoom in...) and for the widescreen presentation, and simply because this film is a gem that has finally gotten it's due.  But, oh jeez, stay away from the commentary...it's absolutely depressing.",1031702400,,2275,4.827319587628866
380852,1,6301932420,"Before we start. I want to affirm that I love this film.  Great script, great performances, great soundtrack, great directing.
Also, regardless of the negative feedback I give this DVD, we are unfortunately obligated to buy it, if we ever want to see a special edition DVD.
Ok, here goes.  Yeah it looks great.  But it just felt wrong.  I couldn't place the reason.  I thought maybe it was a visual matter.  But I quickly realized that what was bugging me was the soundtrack.  It was inexplicably, utterly mangled.
Will someone tell me why?  Why were the vocals for whole songs removed?  I am sorely disappointed and angered by this.  I am outraged by the George Lucas style of re-working your film for DVD, and abandoning the original theatrical cut.  If you feel the need to improve your film, fine, provide an alternate cut, or additional scenes, or whatever, that's great.  Give me the option on the menu to see the ""improved version, or the regular cut.  But don't alter a classic, and not even mention it and try to pass it off as the original.
There are so many examples of this butchering, that I can't name them all. I only watched it once last night, and am at work now, but a few definitely come to mind.
#1 The scene where Trash and Suicide and the gang are speeding towards the cemetery used to have the Damned song Dead Beat Dance as the background music.  Well, not anymore!  You get the inital maniacal laugh, and then nothing, a completely different song.  Why?!
#2 The scene where the zombie says: ""send more cops"", with a thick new york accent.  A classic scene right?  We all loved it right?  Well did you notice that they changed the voice?  Did you notice that is was awful in comparison, and not nearly as funny?  Was there a good reason for this sacrilege?  Has Dan O'Bannon lost his mind, or was this the studios fault? In the end credits, where the best-of scenes replay a second time, we hear the ""send more cops"" line in all its original glory.  So I know I am not imagining this.
#3 What's his name, the Pathmark guy (no slight intended, his performance was excellent), takes his own life by placing himself in the crematorium.  In the original version of this scene is accompanied by the song Burn the Flames, which sports a haunting guitar solo at the exact moment the door shuts and we hear the man's tortured screams.  It is actually one of my favorite scenes in the film.  The haunting music enhances the sadness of the moment.
But not anymore.  Now the music is faded out in a particularly unartistic way, and the scene plays silent.  Sorry but this is a disgrace.  I waited years for this film to be re-released and I feel betrayed.  The soundtrack was perfect the way it was.  In a different film it would not be as a big of a deal.  But when you are the ONLY zombie/comedy/horror film with a punky soundtrack, and a damned good one, and everyone loves you for it, you don't go around meddling and altering, deleting and rewriting, compiling and defiling.
It go to the point where I held my breath with every song change, worried sick that they would ommit lyrics or do away with the track altogether.  Waves of relief washed over me when I reached the scene where the zombies are attacking the funeral home (and our heroes are furiously nailing doors and windows shut)and I discovered that the Cramps song ""Surfin Dead"" was left intact.  Thank god, or the devil, for that one.
Could I be wrong?  Did I miss some sort of soundtrack feature, where mistakenly clicked something off or on?  Or is the sad fact that this movie has been permanently altered...?",1031529600,301,3592,4.506191950464396
380853,2,6301932420,"I first saw The Return of the Living Dead about ten years ago, back when horror films were still in full ""80's style,"" meaning they didn't have the annoying sarcasm of too many of today's genre offerings.  But Return was different, aiming for laughs and scares, a combination that wasn't too popular at the time.  Ten years ago, Return of the Living Dead scared the ...out of me, when I was still a young kid who had never seen a zombie film before.  Having just seen it recently, I now find myself trying to stifle a yawn.  That's right, the movie actually gets pretty dull, something you'd never expect from a film about zombies on the loose in a cemetery.
And really, it started so well, with genuine comic inspiration.  Basically, the story is about a chemical that gets loose and brings the dead back to life, but unlike pretty much every zombie movie out there, nothing can kill them, except burning them to ashes.  So the majority of the running time follows a gang of punks and factory workers trying to survive while the zombies run amok outside.
The first thirty or so minutes feature a number of laughs, including one riotously hilarious scene where the workers try to kill a zombie by disabling its brain.  Unfortunately, comic momentum fails to last, as the rest of the film stops delivering the humor and, supposedly, tries to deliver thrills.  This approach fails to work, the film is neither scary nor exciting.
The action scenes don't bring about much excitement mainly because it's hard to ignore the slapstick mood the movie has.  It feels like these scenes should be funny, but director Dan O'Bannon approaches the last forty-five minutes without attempting an honest-to-God joke.  If he did, it was pretty much material that had already been presented at the beginning (the whole ""send more cops"" line gets very tiresome).
The other huge flaw is the soundtrack, which noticably dates the film back to the 80's.  Any possibility for sheer visceral thrills in the movie's second half is smothered by the lame punk rock songs.  The movie's own score sounds more comical in general, which doesn't fit well with the more horror-oriented approach.  Thus, O'Bannon really stuck himself in a corner, resulting in a film that ultimately fails to produce an adequate amount of both laughs and thrills.
But the movie still has a large fan base, so a lot of people must still find it fresh and funny, so who knows, you might enjoy it more than I did.  Return isn't really such a bad movie; hell, the acting's actually decent and the production values are pretty good, but I'll take George A. Romero's Living Dead series, the recent Resident Evil, and even Return's own sequel (which did maintain comic momentum throughout) over this entry.

380868,5,6301932420,"Although it is overlooked by many horror fans, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is a very important film for it updates the ""zombie movie"" into a fully mature sub-genre inside horror cinema. We all know Romero's great trilogy NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD and DAY OF THE DEAD. These were great films for they were the true beginning of the ""zombie movie"". But in the 80's, the zombies lost terrain to the slasher movies (in the FRIDAY THE 13th tradition) and more compeling villains (in the Fred Krueger tradition).
Being a zombie fan, O'Bannon knew that the zombies needed an updating. This is why RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is so important: it brought the zombies into the 80's character/action oriented horror films. With this thought, he wrote a great screenplay that rewrote the ""zombie genesis"". So, in this film, the zombies of George A. Romero are refered as a mild version of something that was really true: a chemical accident in India that ended as an Army cover-up operation; and the Romero's zombies just a way of putting it into films without being bothered by the U.S. Army.
Having established that point, O'Bannon introduces us to the REAL zombies: living dead that talk and move (they run!) just as living people do. They are extremely dangerous because they are not those dumb slow-moving zombies people used to walk through (like in the Romero's films). They are also intelligent as they devise ways of getting what they want - brains. And this is where O'Bannon makes a new wonderful twist: the zombies do not die by destroying their brains (for they are already dead and the brain has nothing to do with it). Instead it is the zombies who try to eat living brains!
Having said that, it is also important to point that the screenplay is a beautiful piece of cinematic storytelling for two reasons. FIRST because the whole story works flawlessly in the sense that the inicial incident, the characters' actions and the consequences are very well constructed. SECOND because the story weaves a sense of loneliness and confinement (I am talking about the way they treat the narrative space in relation to the story) that works wonders with the characters and what happens with them (this treatment of space echoes Romero's masterpiece DAWN OF THE DEAD).
The ending is great (so great that the sequels didn't touch it)and the soundtrack is very good. The actors are well cast and the film boasts a lot of dry humour.
The extras in this DVD edition are fine and they show that a good edition of a film who's by now more that 15 years old is a matter of wanting it. Congratulations to MGM! RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is not the best horror movie ever, but inside the zombie sub-genre it is one of the best things ever made. Scarry and fun!
The only flaw (for me) in this movie is a female zombie who speaks without lips. I never found it credible. But who cares!",1030492800,,2879,4.625

380870,4,6301932420,"""Return of the Living Dead"" is a hilarious horror/comedy inspired by George A. Romero's classic ""Living Dead"" movies. I saw this movie when I was just a small kid and loved it. This is about as Camp 80's as horror movies get.
The movie's premis is a nice homage to Romero. Apparently, the movie ""Night of the Living Dead"" was based on a true story, and it was covered up by the US government. The bodies of the zombies were sealed in oil drums and dispersed. Two workers at a medical supplies warehouse find one of these drums, puncture it be accident, and unleash a gas that brings the nearby dead back to life. As luck would have it, the warehouse is right next to a graveyard. The rest writes itself, and the movie has some of the funnist moments in horror movie history: A cadaver running amok in the warehouse, a zombie's head being hit out of the park with a baseball bat, a zombie who orders ""more paramedics"" like he was ordering pizza. And above all, a stylish 80's hard rock soundtrack.
This is one of my favorite party movies, because it get everyone (even the non-horror fans) howling. It is sometime bloody, but the comedy overshadows the horror elements. The DVD in question is a bit light on the extras, save for a documentary that is fun, but tepid. But the big perk is the best picture and sound quality I have ever seen this movie in.

While the update was novel - it certainly wasn't any better than Romero's Day of the Dead. But unlike Day of the Dead, Return never takes itself seriously - its saving grace it seems. Not as funny as I once remember, almost ridiculously dated, and sadly - in need of a remake itself.

380890,4,6301932420,"If you're looking for true scares then this might not be the one for you, because this is one of those horror films that has the tongue pressed firmly in the cheek.  To me this movie is ""Dead and Burried"" lite.  Because in 1981 Dan O'Bannon wrote the best zombie movie ever where like the zombies in this movie, they move at normal speed and can talk instead of groan (in fact in Dead and Burried the zombies look like normal people).  Don't get me wrong I like the Romero zombies too but these ones are more memorable.  I challenge you to name me two zombies from a Romero film.  Anyways, in this movie Night of the Living Dead wasn't fiction as the characters in this film soon find out... the hard way.  I'm not going to go into details because there are several other reviews that do but when a couple of people make a few bad decisions in a row... wackiness ensues.  As well as a deathtoll.
  The features on this disc are great... for the film.  Don't get me wrong, they aren't anything compared to Fight Club, T2, or Magnolia's features.  But they are still plentiful.  I mean not even the Coen Brothers have TV spots or commentary or even a featurette on their discs.  Truth be told... I thought it would be just a trailer.  I don't even remember what the tv spots were like back then.  I have to say... this is the way all DVDs should be for bare bones features.

The reason why I love it so much...couldn't tell ya.  It's just one of those movies that keep you forever.  I loved it.  It's a unique zombie flick.  With the portrayal of younger adolescents, I think it gives the movie a certain edge that no other zombie, or any other horror film for that matter, has ever had. Past, present and I will boldy say future.  With combinations of laughs, scares, and gore, it surpasses every horror movie ever made.  The character of Suicide and Trash are my two favorites.  Unfortuanately for me, they are the first two to be devoured by brain starved zombies.  But I always looked at it this way, Trash got what she wanted...""A bunch of old men to surround me. And start bighting, and eating me alive.""  I see.  Trust me, if you are an avid horror fanatic like myself and love zombie films, check this one out!

380892,5,6301932420,"This is a truly scary-funny updating of the living dead concept that is well plotted, well cast, moves fast, looks great, and is a surprisingly original and entertaining movie. It has ""EC comic book gore"" in full color but there's a wit and style about it that you won't find in lesser films of the genre. The movie also boasts a sustained level of hysterical commitment by the actors that is downright exciting and infectious.  This was directed by the talented Dan O'Bannon.
Dan O'Bannon is another product of the U.S.C. Cinema department who worked early on with grad student John Carpenter on the low budget cult hit DARK STAR (with the infamous and hilarious beachball alien); Dan appears in a creditable role in that movie as straight man to the beach ball and his scenes are some of the funniest in what is a pretty clever sci-fi movie. Later in his career, O'Bannon is credited with providing Walter Hill with the concept for the hit movie ALIEN.
In this film Dan gets to direct, and he's good at it. If you are looking for a highly entertaining crossover entry in this genre with teen appeal, grue, humor, some genuine shivers, one uninhibitedly nude female, a strangely plausible premise, and a large dose of wit, give this clever outing a try. It even LOOKS professional, despite a likely low budget. Bravo!",1025654400,,1318,4.705627705627705
380893,5,6301932420,"After over a decade of being out of print (do to legal wrangling in regards to the film's punk rock soundtrack that is prominently featured throughout the film) the classic 1980s zombie film that turned heads with it's dark humor, witty script, and original zombie design is now available on DVD!
Freddy is a typical early 1980s punk rock fan who, on his first day at work at UNEEDA Medical Supply, learns that the movie ""Night of the Living Dead"" was based on an actual event involving zombies and that UNEEDA one day came into possession of one of the zombies which is now being held in a cylinder in the basement. A non-believing Freddy is shown the container just as it explodes, filling the supply company's building with a toxic green gas. The gas causes the sole human body in the body to come to life (as well as freeing the zombie from it's cylinder prison) and after failing to destroy the zombie the tradition way (cutting of it's head) they take it to the local crematorium to be cremated. Unfortunately this makes things MUCH, MUCH worse as the smoke laced with the toxic chemical mixes with storm clouds that rain down on the city at night and resurrecting the bodies buried inside the town's cemetary where ironically Freddy's fellow punk-friends are having a little party.
The kicker for Return of the Living Dead that makes it a classic film and makes it one of the most well loved zombie movies is the fact that the film's zombies aren't your typical movie zombie. They are smart (luring police to the crematorium after killing off several cops who come to investigate all of the strange activity going on), are fast and agressive instead of slow and dumb and the zombies have the most hilarious banter involving their thirst for brains that can have even the most squeemish movie viewer laughing.
Featuring a great punk rock sound-track and a great mix of humor and violence, this film has sadly been out of circulation for over a decade do to the it's punk soundtrack. Now it's back on the market on DVD. This is a must buy DVD for any true horror fan....",1025568000,48,2075,4.595687331536388

Even its aspect ratio is one of audience compromise, situated between full screen utilization and the narrow strip of cinescope fulfillment.

380906,5,6301932420,"If you're buying this, you already know the plot so I won't bore you with a review of that. Instead, the good stuff.
An absolutely PERFECT blend of horror and comedy. I honestly cannot think of any other film that pulled it off so well. Unlike George Romero's zombie trilogy, ""Return of the Living Dead"", written/directed by Dan O'Bannon, it didn't take itself seriously. It had FUN. It never dragged, zipping you from one moment of dread to another and when it got too gory or intense, O' Bannon brought in the laughs. Not slapstick but genuine, over-the-top gags. Whether it be a hungry zombie asking to ""send more cops"" as if he was ordering pizza or the bumbling warehouse employees who, after accidentally releasing a toxic gas that re-animates corpses, find that killing zombies by destroying the brains doesn't work. When they finally exclaim ""WELL IT WORKED IN THE MOVIES!"" you know the rules have been thrown out the window.
The film works on so many levels of gore and humor and the fact that it makes fun of itself and Romero's classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" come off as more self-aware than Wes Craven's ""Scream"" films of the 90's.
The film took it's chances and could've angered fans of Romero's original by actually referring to that movie within the first few minutes, saying it was all fictional and that ""what really happened was..."" well you get the idea. In fact, O'Bannon tried as hard as possible to make his film as different from Romero's. You see, O'Bannon's zombies could RUN after you, could think and plan ways to get at you, they could TALK to you and tell you what part they wanted to eat from you......""BRAINS!""
The film's punk rock soundtrack is excellent. Dare I say ""goth punk""? Sure it fit in with the punk characters that got stuck in the horror but the tone of the songs fit in so well with the movie.
 The cast was superb, all somehow finding the perfect way to play their parts. There isn't a single 'off' performance. Frank's over-the-top ""freaking out"", Burt's calm ""this is what we're gonna do"" attitude and Freddy's realization of what's happening to his body and mind all showcase the talent that made the film work.
When one of our heroes (who's been zombiefied) commits suicide by burning himself ""alive"" in the crematorium....it's not horrific but truly sad. Actor James Karen embodied 'Frank' with such an ""every guy"" quality, you couldn't help but feel for him. Thom Mathews played ""Freddy"". A new level was added to the zombie genre. We see a young man, full of life with lots of partying left to do, slowly get snuffed out. He was exposed to the gas you see and he's slowly dying.....yet already dead. He's conscious while feeling rigor mortis setting in.....and he describes every pain to you. It's unsettling. Clu Gulager plays the warehouse owner 'Burt' (his best friend who owns the funeral home next door? Ernie. Nope, not kidding!) who seemingly dead pans throughout the entire film. While the entire film is going crazy, he is the constant throughout and you feel that if you were in the same situation, you'd want him there helping to make crucial decisions. Linnea Quigley, the ""B-movie scream Queen"" plays 'Trash'. Her infamous, FULL FRONTAL strip tease has left many of my fellow 20-something's with fond memories of their childhood.
This film parodied it's sub-genre of horror YEARS before the junk that was the ""Scream"" trilogy. It also managed to be FAR scarier than Wes Craven's poor attempts which basically amounted to a ""Boo!"" a 9 year old attempts on Halloween. Dan O'Bannon, the film's writer/director (partly responsible for the classic ""Alien"") created a film that, in every way, perfectly blended horror and humor. I'm not saying it's the first, I'm saying it's the first at *doing it right.*
 O'Bannon saw the genre in a way most could not. Treat it's subject with respect yet realize, this is incredibly silly. O'Bannon's script is self-aware yet understands it's fictional world is very real. We get the humor, the film's characters aren't so lucky.
The film goes the opposite of what you'd expect in such a subtle way. The hapless humans are caged in places normally associated with the dead (a funeral home, a medical supply warehouse) whereas the dead are free to roam around in the land of the living. Subtle. This is NOT a ""dumb"" film at all (as some uneducated people might mistake ""zombie"" films for.) It's an ironic, horrific, campy and witty take on a classic horror genre. A film I can watch over and over again and never get bored.
As for the DVD itself, MGM has remastered the film from the original negative ensuring a pristine print. The sound has not only been remastered but some sound FX have been ""enhanced"" or completely redone by O'Bannon. The soundmix is in mono which is prefered by O'Bannon. Both full screen and widescreen versions are available. An audio commentary is on the disc featuring O'Bannon and production designer William Stout. Other extras include a featurette called ""Designing the Dead"", a stills gallery of the movie's artwork and the theatrical trailer. Great movie, superb video/audio and some decent extras all for a LOW price!
MGM has said if this disc sells well, a ""director's cut"" will be released.

When Frank and Freddy, employees of the Uneeda Medical Supply company, decide to check out rumors surrounding the metal cylinders stored in the basement-cylinders reportdly containing the bodies of capyured zombies-they've no idea of the horror awaiting them. Frank confidently slaps the side of a cylinder, and both to their horror, a putrid green vapor spurts out. The men are overcome by the fumes. Inside the cases bodies begin to stir. Their hunger for human brains is as urgent as ever. But this time it's not a movie. This time it's for real!

When he asks his uncle Frank, "" what's the weirdest thing he ever saw?"", his uncle tells him that the movie Night of the Living Dead  was based on a true story. Frank goes on to say that the army accidentally shipped the reanimated corpses back to their warehouse where they now  lie dominate in steel cylinders. Seeing that Freddy is still a little skeptical, Uncle Frank takes him down to the cellar to show him the cylinders and they  inadvertently release trioxin 245 into the air. You may be asking yourself what is trioxin 245? Well, its a chemical that the Darrell Chemical Company developed for the army to spray on marijuana and of course to............bring the dead back to life.
The putrid green vapor seeps up into this warehouse of oddities bringing back to life anything that was once alive ( i.e. split dogs, butterflies, etc) and of course, the lone medical school cadavers hanging in the freezer. As they try to kill the brain, they realize the movie was a LIE.  Instead they decide to chop the corpse into little pieces and take it next door to the crematorium. But burning the corpse, only releases trioxin 245 into the air where a passing shower brings it raining down onto a cemetery.
Too bad for Freddy's friends who were waiting for him in the cemetery. The dead are back and looking for live BRAINS.

The characters are just a bunch of oddballs thrown intelligently into this unfortunate situation with some funny and scary results. The zombies from the original NOTLD are accidentally sent to a warehouse, where are unwitting victims work, instead of being sent to the Army where they belong. The army has no idea where the shipment has gone and after all these years are still tracking it down. Meanwhile at the warehouse of the dead the main warehouse clerk is showing his new assistant the ropes. He tells the NOTLD story as if it were a real event (and in this film, it was a true event which took place). He offers to prove it by showing the assistant the zombies which are trapped in some glass covered 55 gallon drums. The drum springs a leak and the two start choking and all hell literally breaks loose. This stuff in the barrel with the living dead permeates the air bringing all things dead to life...one of the living dead is burned and the smoke and ashes from his body is released into the air...it rains in the cemetary where the warehouse assistant's friends await the end of thier friend's workday...what do YOU think happens next...you can guess the rest.

380936,5,6301932420,"This movie is the best movie in the whole world!!! Really it is! This movie has it all baby! I watch this movie 1 time a week... mostly on Fridays. I have SO MANY Return of the Living Dead collectibles. Return of the Living Dead is the BEST I mean..THE BEST horror movie of all time.
Its funny and entertaining at the same time. If I added up how many times I saw this movie it would be like over 974 times...maybe even more!! YOU GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE. IT IS THE BEST.",1000944000,,469,4.0
380937,5,6301932420,"Of all zombie flicks, Return of the Living Dead 1 ties for first (along with Evil Dead, which is KINDA zombie-esqe).  From the moment the two baffled med-supply workers beat a reanimated split dog, you know you're in for one twisted flick.  The special effects are great, the acting is good, the storyline is super campy fun. Ravenous zombies with a penchance for BRRRRRRRRRRRRAINS! As far as pop culture monster movies go, only Lost Boys approaches this fun realm of punk-rock ghoulies (only THAT movie takes itself too seriously).  With a great soundtrack and a splendidly dark ending (gleefully over the top), this is one of my favorite movies ever... I am impatiently awaiting a wide-screen dvd release.",997056000,5,707,4.97457627118644
380938,5,6301932420,"A sudden storm brings a shower of rain polluted with 245 Trioxin (an actual chemical!,used to break out riger mortis) which soaks into the ground of a nearby cemetery which makes something stir six feet under. The bad news is that the living dead are back. The worse news is that they haven't had anything to eat in years. Ask anybody and they will tell you that there is nothing worse than a greedy ghoul with a taste for human brains. This is, by far, the best horror movie from the early 80's, with a punk twist, and a great cast including James Karen, who played the owner of the neighborhood in Poltergeist and Linnea Quiggley, the Scream Queen of 80's horror, who does a naked graveyard dance. The only thing wrong with this movie is that it isn't available on tape or DVD. If you are a true fan of this movie, you would wait for the release of the Region 1 DVD (August, 2002) instead of buying an old copy of the tape ..., like I did, or the Region 2 DVD from England that people sell for rediculous prices and say its rare, when its NOT, here in the states. .... The guy who made this page knows just about everything there is to know about the movie, and he has a book coming out somethime next year.",996969600,2,1209,4.238095238095238

7816889,5,6301932420,"Excellent remastering of it. Looks very crisp. The commentary tracks are also fun to listen to and the documentary is worth it too. You find out about there use to be an ""Indian Skeleton Farm"" that soon after closed down after the film.

This was where the brain eating ""zombies"" sub-genre came from. This one movie. And its multiple lesser sequels. It has its own look and the fact that the creatures talk and eat make them something else than ""zombies"" which are living-dead slaves whose souls are captured and held by the bokor to work for him/her.

These creatures have their own history and a nod to ""Night Of the Living Dead"" since on of the co-writers  of the script is John Russo who was involved in the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" 20 years before.",1525392000,,764,4.521739130434782

This is an old time classic my family and I would watch and was so disappointed to get it and see it was different then waist I order. I would have like to get what I paid for and what I was expecting. The cover of this movie is ugly and I don't even know if its the special edition collection, how am I suppose to know with a different item that was sent to me. I gave it a two star not because of the movie itself is awesome, but they sent me a wrong movie. Disappointed cause I bought two and didn't get what i paid for.",1522627200,,632,3.688888888888889
