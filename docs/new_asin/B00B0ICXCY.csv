8560317,5,B00B0ICXCY,"This is an excellent dvd for anyone who wishes to strike with dynamite! Kurt Howland uses his extensive boxing backround to show how boxing punching mechanics are translated to Krav Maga,or self-defense striking,without using the fist as boxing does! Palm heels are instead the focus of this dvd. And with study and practice on a heavy bag or dummy,ANYONE can learn to power strike!",1480291200,,382,4.984375
