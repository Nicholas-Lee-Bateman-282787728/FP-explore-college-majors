8493333,5,B00657VVR8,"I remember watching this film a long time ago on YouTube when 'Slender Man' was still fresh, and I was so creeped out by it. Watching it again a couple of years later, I will say it still holds up with the 'creepy' factor. I found this film to take a very unique twist on 'The Slender Man' that worked to this movie's advantage in my opinion. What begins as an eerie campfire story, slowly starts to become a reality. It turned Slender Man almost into a completely different creature, and I found it to be very interesting. This movie had tension, story, and decently-acted characters. The only problem I had personally with the film, was the last ten or fifteen minutes of it. That was when the film started to feel 'cheesy' to me. However, the VERY LAST SCENE of the film was a creepy, and shocking end that made up for the earlier 'cheese'. Out of all the Slender Man films I've seen (Despite that list not being very large) I find this one to be one of the best. If you like Slender Man, found footage, and indie films, I feel you will enjoy this film as well.",1447545600,,1064,4.298507462686567
8493334,1,B00657VVR8,"PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE. The first 2/3 is so slow it is like the last day of school..then suddenly we have slenderman peeking around corners and all this distorted film, garbled language and some very stupid looking fist fighting.  The characters are not distinguished and appear to come and go...I honestly don't know what went on!  And the narrator---that voice would put anyone to sleep--monotone!!!!  See the real WINDIGO with Patrica Clarkson instead or read a crossword puzzle aloud--anything is preferable to this drivel.",1419638400,,532,5.235294117647059
8493335,1,B00657VVR8,"I saw this piece of trash years ago while on a deployment in the Marines. Everyday for 7 months was TRULY like groundhog day (movie) as we were confined to this small small camp, a.k.a. tent city, during the Iraq invasion. Everyone was constantly in search of ways to pass the time. Sleep was the best when we had the chance. All that being said, I'd rather I had passed the hour and a half I spent watching this garbage poking myself in the eye with a needle  or chewing on broken glass than view this horrible joke. As the saying goes: I've seen soap leave a better film than this. You only continue to watch something this insanely bad because you're astounded by the atrocity of it all.",1407283200,,690,4.348837209302325
8493336,2,B00657VVR8,"Yes, well.  I had viewed Windigo on youtube as it was originally released and have this to say about it.

PROS
-Decent concept for the plot, introducing the windigo legend indigenous to the setting
-Had intriguing parts that made me wonder where this movie was going.
-Good job handling characters falling apart.

CONS
-the POV film style would have worked better as a slendervlog, not as a feature.
-hardly any meaningful content for the majority of the film.
-Gives no reason to care for these characters, hardly any development at all.
-Final scene of the film, absolutely, ridiculously insane!  Not the good kind of insane either.  Feel like the director got bored with the majority of the film and at the end needed to frantically express all of his pent up excitement at the sheer boredom of the rest.  Things are all over the place and you can't even understand what on earth just happened or what's going on all of a sudden.  It's like someone just randomly or haphazardly flipped the ""oh god!  we need to finish this movie!!"" switch, and called it a day.
-sadly not one of the better slender man related productions

Conclusion:

  The film had great promise!  The drawback was that the way in which it was executed was poor at best.  Acting was fair or even good at some points.  A vlog format would have given this story, paced as it was, a better outlet for character development and story portrayal of this POV style.",1346371200,3,1430,4.6414342629482075
8493337,1,B00657VVR8,"This is a horrible film. It's not scary at all, it's mostly just them walking around and filming shit. The effects don't add to it at all, it in fact makes it seem stupider. Save your money, don't buy this.",1345939200,2,206,4.175
8493338,3,B00657VVR8,"Windigo starts off in a promising Blair Witch-styled film about students making a documentary. Interviews with the townsfolk of  Bonville go on longer than they should, and could have easily been edited down to 15 minutes and still have the same effect. Their interviews through are interesting, as well as the back-story of the main character I believe it was, but this could have been explored more. The 'stars' of the documentary are well acted and annoying and seem very real and even had me cursing at the screen with the stupid things they said and did. But when a character goes missing for no reason, the film gets suspenseful it is revealed the residents of the town are trying to hide something.

The film starts to turn into a psychological thriller with the realism of the threat the characters are in, but then it turns into a badly edited piece of incoherent filmmaking with bad acting, a confusing script and silly action scenes. One scene even has a character swimming through a lake for no apparently reason, even though there was land he could have walked round. I know that as it is an independent movie the action scenes wouldn't have been choreographed by a highly trained professional, but could have had more effort into them, instead of looking like a high school project where they all wanted to create a zombie-like shoot-them-up movie. The script starts to make no sense and you don't know how a certain person gets rescued and how he even kills the main mostly unseen villain, it then becomes confusing into why a few of the characters are going crazy and you don't know whose side you are supposed to stick with. It seems like the film makers and actors wanted to have more fun creating what they believed would be 'scary' than focusing on a interesting and satisfying conclusion, even if it still left some questions you'd hate that weren't answered.

The three quarters of the movie were impressive, but the obvious editing in post-production for the distorted effects could have been edited better to look more realistic than obviously, like said, created in post-production. The dialogue all seemed natural, but could have been worked on more when the ""Slenderman"" was seen, someone could have at least mentioned him, even if they just called it strange.",1341360000,2,2287,4.814249363867685
8493339,5,B00657VVR8,"A great movie for anyone who is learning film making or about horror. This film acts as a stepping stone and prime example for great indie horror. The film is cheap, VERY cheap, but it is enjoyable nonetheless. The DVD has a lot of cool features on it too so if you have 20 dollars to spare I highly recommend this movie. Thanks for reading.",1339632000,2,341,4.2615384615384615
