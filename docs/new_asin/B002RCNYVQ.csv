8378642,3,B002RCNYVQ,"This is a wonderful CD, second of a series.  I liked the first CD better than this one as it had better dances with more variety, but the 2 together make a nice set and excellent examples of what Tribal Belly Dance is all about.  Buy the 2 together is my recommendation.",1291680000,4,270,4.173076923076923
8378643,5,B002RCNYVQ,"I love this dvd for the variety of different dances instead of a bunch of cookie cutter size o dancers. I was pleasantly surprised to see  male dancers,but it added to the variety.",1288310400,4,180,4.454545454545454
8378644,2,B002RCNYVQ,"As my expectations were much higher for a widely distributed DVD of numerous bellydance performances by varying artists, this will be an unkind review. So here goes: Bellydancing is basically a series of fluid, serpentine movements enacted through the rhythm of music.  Serpentine-snake or snakelike. Now, how many fat snakes have you ever seen?  I know, it's mean; but I bought this with the impression that there would have to be at least one good dance. Not for me. Actually, I envisioned two good dances, as two future Bellydance Superstars are on this DVD: Sabrina Fox and Elizabeth Strong. Not to discredit them, as their performances on BDSS are great, but they should've been allowed to perform solo, rather than with one or more other dancers. Maybe that was their downfall here. The company that released the DVD isn't necessarily bad; Tribal Revolution had several good dances-notably Zoe Jakes and Ariellah. I recommend that one instead.",1281830400,,949,5.076923076923077
