Check if your system is multisystem dvd. The director tells the story of Princess Miao Chan, one of the incarnations of the Goddess of Compassion and Forgiveness, Kuan Yin. The film is rich in detail and gives the story I found in many studies, in several Asian countries, on the Goddess Kuan Yin. It is very beautiful and sensitive. I hope to find other films about this subject with the same quality and fidelity to the real story.",1393632000,,596,4.330357142857143
