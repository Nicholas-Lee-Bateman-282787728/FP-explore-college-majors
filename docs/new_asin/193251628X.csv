The only bad thing is see it that the video is old. You can easily tell that it was filmed in the late 70's early 80's. So when you use this material for training, it can come across as ""outdated"" material or content. The trainer needs to do additional work to move his audience out of this mind set into ""let's look at the content"" more than ""how the content looks"". The author has created online training modules based on her book ""Work that makes sense"", so I'd say, this problem is solved if you want to pay for that material. So far, I am very happy with my old videos.",1443052800,,787,4.3175675675675675
