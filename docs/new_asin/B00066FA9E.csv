8039244,5,B00066FA9E,"December 29/1986 has been the obituary of Andrei Tarkovsky. The relevancy of his genius and his artistic achievements are still matter of discussion all around the world. For all those who were aware of his transcendence, since I watched Andre Rubliov in 1973, and the rest is part of the recent story.

This documental is just a little but significant homage to his memory. The filmmakers of the future and sill well renowned directors who have been influenced by him have an eternal debt with his message.
