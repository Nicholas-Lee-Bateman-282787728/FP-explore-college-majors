3175521,5,B0017TCSMG,"The professionalism of this presentation is excellent.  Of course, for it to make sense you really need to buy all 3 volumes.  Do so at one time,as you will get a price break, AND avoid problems such as I had obtaining all three.  First I ordered Volume 1.  So good, I thought I would order Vol. 2.  Volume 2 came in broken.  So next I thought I would order 2 & 3 at the same time.  But the order taker sent me two of the same volume 2. I tried to return one Volume 2, etc.  Problems continued, to be brief.  Ultimately while the internet said they were still one in stock, none were on the shelf.  I had incorrect volumes to make a complete set, and a hassle trying to get the right one, with the particular one I needed out of stock. To be brief, I was  treated poorly.  I would have been most satisfied if it had been placed on back order, but instead I had to wait ~9 months until the CD became available again.  That service, finally, was excellent.  Satisfied with the product, not satisfied with Customer Service.  A simple we made a mistake would have led to their credibility.  Am still feeling mistreated.",1291680000,,1115,4.2631578947368425

I memorized 95% of this dvd in less than 15 minutes.  No more than 6-7 swings are taught.  Also, this is strictly beginner fare.  I would expect this sort of thing to be a free promo on a website it is so short.  This should have been priced at under $10.  I like learning various martial arts via DVD, and the material presented on this DVD is just sad.  I'm sorry, and I don't mean to be rude, but I would not recommend buying this.

It covers the following

Tying an Obi
How to Wear the Hakama
How to fold the Hakama
Sword Etiquette (Reiho)
Postures (Kamae)
Drawing Cuts (Nukitsuke) - 2 New Cuts
-- Kiri Age
-- Tsukikage
Two Handed Cuts (Kirioroshi) - 2 New Cuts
-- Migi Gyaku Kesa
-- Hidori Gyaku Kesa
Thrusts (Tsuki) - 2 New Thrusts
-- Ushiro
-- Morote
Forms (Kata) - 4 New Kata

Drills (Batto Ho Kumitachi) - 2 New

For all the Cuts and the forms, the DVD talks you through the task while it is being demonstrated.  Then the DVD does a slow motion demo and then a real time demo.
For the Drills, the DVD talks you through the task while the two demo the task.  Then the drills are done in real time twice.  Once from the front and once from the back.

Production values are first rate (there is a noticeable hiss on some occasions and some aliasing with the striped pants but other than that very good), the demonstrations are masterful, and the voice ""acting"" is acceptably good.",1263859200,26,1394,5.280542986425339
