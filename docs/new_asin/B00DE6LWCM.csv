5793631,3,B00DE6LWCM,"Let be blunt. This movie is essentially a product plug for the Robosapien line of toy robots. However as a movie with a blatant marketing angle  it does offer a good deal more. This is entirely a kid's film, and doesn't give much to endear an audience much older than grade school levels. At the same time what it does offer to those grade-schoolers is more than kid hijinks, and that's what makes this movie a slight cut above many in this genre.

The story is about a diminutive search and rescue robot, Cody, that was programmed with an artificial intelligence that has the personality of a young boy. It performs perfectly for its role. The company, in its infinite wisdom, decides to go all evil and wants to take this rescue robot, weaponize it, and make it into some sort of little soldier robot... or something like that. With the help of his designer (David Eigenberg), Cody escapes damaged and ends up in the hands of Henry Keller (Bobby Coleman), a 12yr old with a knack for technology that fixes Cody up. What follows is the complexities of the relationships between Cody and his maker and Henry's family. All the while that evil corporation is still after Cody to make him into a mini-terminator.

The story is rather cut and dry with some blatantly cookie cutter conflict with the ""establishment"" wanting to tarnish the virtuous ideals Cody represents. I'm not a fan of such transparent attempts as showing good vs. evil. However that's not where this movie gets its Brownie points. Cody the Robosapien is a story that thrives on the interactions between Cody and those he cares about. This is initially shown with his caring designer going through great lengths to protect Cody. When Cody loses contact with him you see the budding relationship between Cody and Henry, as well as him winning over the family. There is a lot of good spirited interaction that builds up here. Aside from a few goofy attempts to jazz up some scenes (the classroom dance number comes to mind) the interactions Cody has with the family and Henry's classmates feels organic and real. This is the best part of the film, and it creates a satisfying conclusion.

The other aspects of the film are a mixed bag. Cody's abilities make the robot a cool friend to have, but it makes me wonder why a robot built for search and rescue would have some of the features he has, such as a paint sprayer. Of course all the scenes with the corporate executive get hammy with the mustache-twirling evilness. Still these scenes do balance out with some better ones like the scene where Henry fixes Cody, which is one of my favorite segments. Acting is what you would expect for a kids movie. Using Bobby and Holliston Coleman as siblings is a nice touch (they are bother-sister in real life), and makes the rivalry/caring that much more real. I also really dig seeing Rip Torn in a cameo. It's always cool to hear him talk.

Cody the Robosapian is a bare bones disc. The hi-definition transfer is clean, and the contrast during the dark scenes is very clear and detailed. The audio is a clean Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround track, which is fast becoming the industry standard for Blu-Rays. I wouldn't call this a reference disc by any stretch, but you won't be disappointed. It looks like the Blu-Ray loses the Spanish track found in the DVD, but you still get the subtitles. That's pretty much all you get on this release. No director commentary. No extra features. Nothing else but the movie.

For a movie that came out about five years too late for it to be an effective marketing tool for a toy line what you lacked in timing is more or less made up for in a bit of quality content. Don't get me wrong. This is still a kids film with an overly simplistic plot, but it has enough charm to make it quality family programming. If you are looking for anything more than that you will likely be disappointed.",1435017600,,3876,4.59393063583815

5793635,5,B00DE6LWCM,"My 6-year-old son and I watched this together and LOVED it.  He has a RoboSapien robot, so I thought he would like this.  The reviews were good so we gave it a try.  There were a couple sad moments, and a bit of tension, but not too much violence, which I liked a lot.  There was a lot of belly laughing too.  It wasn't available for rental, so I'd gone ahead and purchased it; I'm so glad I did.  My son will watch it over and over.",1423785600,,433,3.9195402298850577

5793639,5,B00DE6LWCM,"My 5 year old son and I watched this together. It's really cute! It's obviously not going to entertain an adult to keep you on the edge of your seat, and like all kid movies, there will be times that you roll your eyes at the ridiculous humor, or the 'I saw it coming' happy ending. But the story line and action keep it interesting. It has some sad parts, good action, some sweet scenes, and overall a really great positive message throughout. I would say this movie is good for kids up to age 8 or maybe a tad older. Any older than that, and they may find it boring. If your children are use to adult-like movies and action, they may find this too 'kiddish'. We thought it was cute and my son keeps asking to watch it over and over. 5 stars from us!",1403049600,,751,4.115646258503402

5793642,5,B00DE6LWCM,My family really loved this movie.  It held the attention of my High School kids as well as my elementary school kid. The action is mild but entertaining and it was very funny at times.  The robosapien is adorable and life like.  The movie could have gone on to be a very explosive and more teen or adult themed but retains innocence while keeping the action moving.  I would see it again and really loved the fact that all parts of my family were entertained.,1396224000,,460,4.376470588235295
