Then you were hooked! Kids around AUSTRALIA loved this TV series from Japan. The actor from this Japanese show came to Sydney & Shintaro the Samurai was swamped! For kids in Sydney it was like meeting the BEATLES!
 It was our first encounter of the martial arts & simply a gas!
The Judo/Karate/Jiu-Jitsu fights & sword play were pure fun. The only other Martial arts show around at the time was (Australian actor)Rod Taylor's 1962 action TV series from 20th Century Fox  ""HONG KONG""
Taylor's fights Boxing VS Karate/Judo were just great! I'd love to see this gem on DVD as well.

Where are the other Volumes of this ""THE SAMURAI"" tv series? Let's see them & you all can enjoy this show!",1219363200,,859,4.493589743589744
