8756652,3,B01DQ5SP84,"The word ""InnSaei"" in Icelandic means, among other terms, ""to see from the inside out."" Icelandic filmmaker Hrund Gunnsteinsdottir journeys to find out what has made humans lose their connection to intuition and what this loss means to our sad quality of life--and explores ways to reclaim our intuition. People from all over the world were filmed and interviewed: from the UK, India, Iceland, Bali, and elsewhere. The subjects ranged from a Harvard business professor to shaman to a performance artist. Probably the best segment showed Marina Abramovic, who was the actual display at New York City's Museum of Modern Art. People lined up to sit across from her, one-on-one, and experience her powerful presence. By simply being present, she elicited deep, real emotional responses in them. This illustrates the focus on emotional connection, which people are losing due to artificial environments (a lack of being in Nature) and an emphasis on data instead of wisdom based on knowledge.

In another excellent segment, someone was talking about the Polynesians who explored and mapped the seas--and were able to navigate back to their home islands, using only their senses as guides. They had no atlases or GPS devices, but they did rely on ancient wisdom that was handed down throughout the ages in their tribes. (It reminded me of the wonderful recent Disney animated film, ""Moana,"" which gave me a lot of background for this interview. If you haven't seen ""Moana,"" do it. And make sure to watch all the extra features showing how the film came to be made. You'll learn tons about the Polynesians. But I digress.)

There was also mention of violence against women in the form of video games. This occupied probably under 2 minutes--but it was powerful and to the point.

So why only 3 stars? (This film actually deserves 3-1/2 stars, but there's no way to notate it.) My biggest complaint was the photography. There were some breathtaking images, many of them depicting the natural world. But many of the images flashed by way too fast--at such a dizzying pace, my head hurt. I had to close my eyes. I knew to open them again when the flickering of the light on the TV screen stopped. It's hard to know if the filmmaker was trying to use the images to point out how chaotic our minds are, due to the speed with which we gulp ""data"" and become dissociated from our calmness and emotional lives. But she says this plenty of times throughout. Does she really need to hit us over the head with an editing technique that creates a feeling of being even more unsettled, dizzy and disconnected? She's not helping her message with these cheap editing tricks. As so many of the photographic images are so beautiful, it's a shame she felt a need to do this.

The science of brainwaves, depicting what happens when people are tuned into their intuition, could have been expanded. One overly long segment showed an innovative technique being used in a UK school: MindUP, where young children are taught to go within and take charge of their emotions so that, for instance, they can dissipate their anger before it escalates. This is a wonderful program. However, this segment focused far too long on a young boy who benefited from the program. I would have preferred hearing from other children who benefited. It would also have been very useful to give some pointers to adults who seek calmness--not a tutorial, but at least a clue. Yeah, we know that humans are disconnected; don't you think it's a good idea to throw in a few ideas on how to fix this? There could have been at least a cursory mention of the various meditation techniques that have plenty of data to back up how they beneficially change heart rate, levels of stress hormones, etc. Also, I would have liked to know more about what happened in the filmmaker's own life. She quit her guaranteed-lifetime job at the United Nations to make this film, when she realized that her own humanity and emotional expressiveness were becoming obscured. What did she learn from what she filmed?

This documentary had such promise. I really wanted to like it more than I did. It's worth seeing, but there are too many flaws and unanswered questions--which, even for a documentary, are more numerous than they should be. Not to mention the headache factor. When you watch it, be ready to close your eyes.",1506211200,,4346,4.797062750333779

8756655,5,B01DQ5SP84,"As can be witnessed by the somewhat negative comment prior to this one - interpretation of a work is everything. For me, this piece opens the dialogue which causes us to look at our day-to-day conduct in a world which leaves most feeling that there's no time to sit with one's own thoughts, feelings, and gain some introspect - even I, as a middle-aged, learned individual, become lost in a sea of electronic communications, researching, referencing, acquiring, achieving, to the point of exhaustion, and years which fly by leaving me to wonder where the time went. We have built a world of human robots who have no time to feel anything - this film counts, perhaps more than any other that I have seen thus far, I highly recommend it.",1487721600,7,735,4.661538461538462
8756656,5,B01DQ5SP84,"The slow pace was challenging at first, and the somewhat meandering theme or direction was too and then I realized I wanted it faster, the meaning, the research, the data. Aha! That is what they are speaking about.  Sit back and allow your intuition to experience this very wise, lovely, penetrating, illumined film.",1487376000,,316,4.962264150943396
8756657,5,B01DQ5SP84,"If you ever wondered why the collection of Big Data is leading to many things failing,
the startling fact that 98% of our 3lbs Brain is NOT involved in this aspect of rational
thought, but only the 0.96 ounces, then you'll want to see where we decided to go
with Wisdom being replaced by Knowledge AND THEN Knowledge being replaced by
Information.  Time to STOP and Breathe a little to get our Lives back.",1486771200,5,405,4.472972972972973
8756658,2,B01DQ5SP84,"I think the premise of this documentary is that ""modern man"" has lost the ability to understand without reasoning or to instinctually know things because he's unable to connect with his emotions. The videography is nice and the creators of this film managed to interview some interesting people, but they never really develop any coherent arguments or even establish any definitions of the concepts they struggle to portray. Watching this film is sort of like having a holiday dinner with your family where there's a loud teenager who's just found out about Buddhism and feels he can now explain how to solve the problems of the world. It's sort of fascinating to realize you were once so clueless yourself, but you admire the energy with which he's embracing a new idea. So, you just watch and listen as he delivers silly generalizations, ungrounded theories, old truisms and rails against injustice and ignorance.",1486771200,4,915,5.026315789473684
