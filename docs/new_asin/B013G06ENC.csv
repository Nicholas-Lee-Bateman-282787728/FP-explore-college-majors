8727569,5,B013G06ENC,"There are a few ""inside jokes"" that, if you speak Japanese, will make this movie more enjoyable.  It is a funny look at a Japanese girl who realizes that she really does want something more out of life than being popular.  Kasumi Arimura is great as the precocious, though endearing, Biri Girl.",1469145600,,294,4.634615384615385

Film = barely three (3) stars; acting = barely three (3) stars; subtitles = barely three (3) stars; script/story = 2.5 stars.  Director Nobuhiro Doi trods the well-worn path of the shomin-geki (home drama) genre by delivering a standard family sitcom complete with role stereotypes, caricatures, and silliness masquerading as drama/comedy.  This feel-good, sophomoric, movie fantasy would seem more appropriate for domestic TV viewers than movie theater audiences.  The Director ensures that there will be no surprises (except maybe one) by aggressively telegraphing future events.  The possible exception is the sudden and radical change in hair styles!  Lead actress Kasumi Arimura never completely leaves her juvenile ""Japanese cuteness"" baggage behind as she progresses (at warp speed!) from bottom-of-the-class in public secondary school to acceptance by a prestigious private university via a year (or so) of private, cram-school coaching.  Acting by Atsushi It playing the cram school teacher/psychologist/philosopher/hand-holder/de-facto-parent/would-be-lover/... is hard to swallow almost from the start and even more so as his character morphs into a caricature.  Actress Yoh Yoshida takes on the typical role of a career-frustrated and long-suffering mother, but does so with aplomb; she consistently delivers the best (and most believable) acting in the film.  All that being said (and at the risk of speculative over analysis), there is, perhaps, another angle to be considered:  soft-core-propaganda with Doi's channeling of Mary Poppins (and her use of sugar to camouflages the bitter taste of medicine).  The Director may be employing a cleaver multilayered pop entertainment wrapper to disguise his lectures on pressing societal issues.  Targeted multi-generational audiences have seen programs of this genre before (they seem to be a staple of contemporary Japanese TV) which only adds to the effectiveness of the sugar coating.  First up, of course, is the theme of the film which is an unrelenting indictment of the Japanese public school system with its focus on mass rote learning (with zero consideration given to individual student needs) and it's failure to prepare students to think for themselves as they become adults.  Replacing public schools with privately chartered ones is the unmistakable message (sound familiar?).  Then there is the negative impact of traditional child rearing where parents force children into a career path that the adults were denied or unable to succeed in.  Student bullying or group-enforced conformity to the lowest educational level of achievement is also covered.  (And there could be a few more packed in there.)  The film is way too long (by half) and boringly repetitious.  The screen play (and direction) look suspiciously like they may have been puffed up to increase the film's duration.  Cinematography  (semi-wide screen, color), lighting, scene continuity, and film score are okay.  Subtitles often provide less than accurate (or complete) translations of line readings, and, essentially, can present a de facto parallel story to the one in the movie!  Many signs are not translated.  Fun to watch, but only with a ton of popcorn!  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1459209600,,3400,5.562256809338521
8727571,4,B013G06ENC,"This is a story about an underperforming high-school student and her ""cram school"" teacher. The teachers at school already gave up on her, but the cram school teacher sees her potential and keeps encouraging her... And by this point you can see where the story is headed.

However, if you can get over the predictable story and its possible interpretations (that the school system may be no good), this is a rather entertaining movie. The actors do a good job as well.

The picture and audio quality is crisp.

The extra features are light -- no interviews or behind the scenes stuff. Curiously, there's a segment of the author (who wrote the story based on his real life experience) giving a lecture to TV personalities. I didn't find that self-promotion too interesting.

Note: This is a Japanese BD release, which carries only Japanese subtitles. You might want to find an international release under an alternative title ""Flying colors"".",1454284800,,941,4.936708860759493
