5362115,5,B009S6CI4S,"Lisa's new DVD is just loaded with good information about 5-Element Theory, internal energy in the body, and how it can be worked with through Qigong practice. Despite being aimed at women, there is an abundance of ideas and data that men will find useful as well. Her presentation is very clear, but very substantial; the DVD beckons re-viewing, and study ... and practice. Nice work, Lisa!",1353196800,10,391,4.850746268656716
5362116,5,B009S6CI4S,"I really loved Lisa's DVD on Qi Gong for women's health. Lisa explains each movement in a very clear, concise and simply way, explaining the benefits of each movement. Her DVD is easy to follow and I felt I could comfortably practice the movements, having watched her do them. She ""mirror"" images each movement, which makes it easier to do them, while watching her. I also liked all the self massages and visualizations for each organ.  The meditations were very relaxing and profound. I would recommend this DVD to everyone, from anyone who knows nothing about Qi Gong, to those who have been practicing Qi Gong for years.",1353196800,3,623,4.768518518518518
5362117,5,B009S6CI4S,"Lisa's pleasant voice conveys so much information in a short period of time. Her instructions are clear and easy to follow. The description of the benefits of each movement is not only interesting,but motivates me to practice. Thanks, Lisa",1353110400,2,239,5.153846153846154
5362118,5,B009S6CI4S,"Am now using my new DVD of Lisa O'Shea's Qi Gong for Women.  As usual, Lisa's explanations let us understand what we are doing and why.  And you don't have to know anything about QiGong for it to help and correct maladies with care and ease.  This is especially good in these times of chaos.  Every woman should have this DVD and use it.  It is a must have for sure.  Kudos and thank you, Lisa, for your wonderful lessons for healing.",1352332800,3,434,4.2317073170731705
5362119,5,B009S6CI4S,"If you are a woman,have mothers, wives, sisters, aunts, friends then buy this DVD for them. Having survived the surgeries, chemo and radiation treatments for breast cancer five years ago, I know the value of Qigong for women. I am a tai chi/qigone instructor and have used these modalities for healing. For me, the arm movements and twisting at the groin/hip joint/kua are helpful in getting the lymphatic system flowing.

This is a very easy to follow DVD, spoken and filmed clearly. The beginning Wave movement is helpful, not only to women, but to anyone needing to loosen their back and spine in a gentle way. I used it in a class with some of my students with severe physical problems. (backs, knees, arthritic joints, hips) Each one of them told me that they felt much better after practicing for only an hour.

Buy one copy for your self, and give others as gifts to all your friends and relatives. The gift of good health is priceless.",1352073600,44,943,4.640718562874252
5362120,5,B009S6CI4S,"I have wanted a dvd that spoke right to some of my personal issues as a female--and this does that very well! Once again Lisa O'Shea makes a dense topic easy to follow and work with. I especially like the ""Healthy Balance"" form she created for the video and now I do it everyday. Thanks so much Lisa--this is great for me and I think it will be great gift for some of my female friends this year too.",1351728000,,400,4.075949367088608

5362132,5,B009S6CI4S,"I have good library of qi gong dvds, and have found them enjoyable to practice, but I have had blockages, stiffness that just was not being helped until I found this wonderful dvd.  Lisa OShea is fantastic at taking complex subjects and simplifying them, She does superb job of introducing western culture to Chinese healing theories.  There are over 3 hours of instruction, detailed exercise practice, followed by more flowing practice, and all three routines are put together for complete routine if one so desires.  It is different caliber of qi gong dvds than I am used to, This one is very clearly for removing blockages, restoring harmony.  The exercises are simple, yet profound. genuinely healing in my experience of using them.  If one is just looking for relaxing routine to follow for maintenance, this is not for you.  This is for specific health issues, using Chinese theory.  Keep in mind that this ancient practice comes from country where majority of inhabitants did not have access to hospitals, doctors, so they had to find their own healing methods. have been doing this for thousands of years. so now we are benefiting from all those years of evolution of this fine healing practice.  Also is very rewarding to have it address women's bodies, women's health concerns.

3/11/14  after using this routine for very short time, I am sleeping deeper than I ever have. Have changed from light sleeper to deep sleeper, waking up fully refreshed.  Not surprising also have more energy and this is growing each day. In truth feel healthier now at 60 years of age than I have felt in over 30 years.  I understand cause for life long issues, and now they are being helped through the instructional help on this dvd.  and wonderful thing is that the whole routine does not take much time, and the included yin meditation is wonderful and making a difference too.  I got deeply burnt out back in  early 90's. and this is helping me understand what really happened, and deal with it, with profound effects.",1394150400,58,2012,4.808139534883721

5362138,3,B009S6CI4S,"There a lot information about organ systems (that I didn't expected and very appreciated for such inform), but I don't understand why this DVD is designed for ""women""? I thought that there will be strictly information/exercises just for women, but there was not! ( or I'm such stupid that I just missed)... Also, some how I could not easily follow her pretty simple instruction. Her rhythm seems personally for me too fast for breathing and strangely unflawed. But I like that sessions are pretty short and she said that you could do it 2-3 time daily. ..and it seems that with her teaching you need go on more deeper level of sensing the easiness....Interesting!",1373846400,2,663,4.824561403508772

She goes beyond when she goes through meditation. Besides, Lisa B. directs the exercises towards women's need, whatsoever was what I was looking for.

The DVD gives detailed instructions on Qi healing techniques and how and why they help in healing our body and mind.  Lisa teaches how to clear out blockages in the organ systems, increase the Qi flow through the organs and regain a healthy balance in our body. The instructions are clear, concise and easy to follow. Teaching and providing knowledge is one part of the DVD. When I just want to follow the Qigong movements and meditation I play that chapter of the DVD only. I feel lighter, relaxed and energized.
