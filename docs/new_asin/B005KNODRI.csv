8477022,5,B005KNODRI,"A delightful DVD from 2011 with 8 or 9 players from the Vienna Philharmonic who call themselves The Phiharmonics.

Five Johan Strauss waltzes,with additional music by Fritz Kreisler and Leopold Godowsky, played by nine members of the Vienna Philharmonic at the Caf Sperl in Vienna. The ensemble is clearly having a great time playing this wonderful music for the dozen or so rapt listeners.",1513468800,,390,5.09375
8477023,5,B005KNODRI,"Very fun.  The players were excellent, the music was wonderful and it's such an unusual setting it made it great viewing.",1435363200,,121,4.761904761904762
8477024,5,B005KNODRI,"The music is good, but what makes it unusually rewarding is the visible interaction among the musicians. When musicians smile at each other and communicate with the eyes, it will make listeners smile too.

You can see some of these clips on YouTube. That's what persuaded me to buy the DVD. It has extra tunes, framing segments, an a short documentary on how the modernists happened to rework Strauss.

Two things bothered me about the recording. One was figuring out where the mics and cameras were. I'm guessing there was an overhead mic setup, not visible in the frame, but it sounds close-mic'd, with great exclusion of background sound, particularly tricky in a hard-surfaced room like that. The credits include a Steadicam operator, and there are some distant zooms, but also camera pull-backs that show no cameras... hard to figure on a realtime recording like this.

The crowd was also a bit distracting. I can understand that they're supposed to be going about their usual business in a cafe, but I don't understand how you can listen to these people play and not stand up and cheer.

The DVD is good, but a major complaint on Amazon... when I search quoted phrase ""the philharmonics"", I expect to find this disc. Even query ""+'the philharmonics'"" fails. Amazon delivery is great, but their discovery seems like it's getting drunker by the month.",1401494400,,1355,4.878260869565217
8477025,5,B005KNODRI,"This selection of mostly waltzes arranged by largely the Second Viennese School of Berg, Schoenberg and Webern is very easy listening and would appeal to anyone who warms to the New Year's Day concerts of the VPO.

The arrangements were written by Berg, Schoenberg and Webern in 1921 as part of a fund raising venture to support their 'Society for Private Musical Performances' and do not sound like the Second Viennese School as most listeners would expect. On the contrary they exude genuine Viennese atmosphere which would be associated with the Strauss era and which has been scaled down and tastefully adapted for a Viennese caf scenario.

Other arrangers featured on this delightful disc are Godowsky, Kreisler and Kovac, none of whom were involved in the Society. What all six have in common is an obvious delight in the music that they have arranged and the desire to share this with a different public in a less formal setting than a ballroom. The playing from these members of the VPO is as expert as one would expect and in idiomatic Viennese style. The recording venue for this production is the genuine caf setting of the Caf Sperl in Vienna with a small caf audience who are free to watch, listen and read or carry on inaudible conversations as they feel appropriate.

The recording is clear with good camera work which nicely captures the ambiance of the event which must have been staged a little if only to effect a recording with all that that would entail. The sound is presented in realistic and atmospheric DTS 5.1 surround and stereo formats.

My wife loved it as an enjoyable surprise to go with her cup of tea when she came home from work! I think that would make an excellent first recommendation! It is hard to imagine this disc failing to give enormous pleasure to future purchasers so therefore, in my opinion, it seems reasonable to rate it as a 5 star issue.",1342742400,4,1888,4.694864048338369
8477026,5,B005KNODRI,"The tittle of this Blu-Ray disc doesn't properly describe it contents. This is chamber music in a caf in Vienna. It is not the super-orchestrated Strauss's waltzes, and that by itself is a great treat.  Serve yourself a cappuccino (mlange in Vienna) and you feel yourself in that Caf. A very `different' experience. For those who have visited Vienna, it also brings some good memories of the city and his famous cafes.
Musically, the whole hour is very interesting and not overly saturated with the typical waltzes. The Bonus material explains the source of the arrangements, in itself a very interesting musical anecdote. In addition to Strauss's waltzes and Kreisler's music, it includes an arrangement by Tobor Kovak that greatly surprised me. Track number 9 is called ""Yiddische Mame"". You wouldn't expect such a tittle in a Viennese music recording. In fact, it is a Potpourri that starts with Mahler, and includes various Yiddish tunes beautifully arranged and performed. Also, I am glad to see Jewish music back in Vienna!
The images and sound are perfect for the settings. In summary, a very pleasant visit to a Viennese caf. Strongly recommended. Don't forget to watch the Bonus material; it will help to put things in the right perspective",1337299200,3,1249,5.0048076923076925
