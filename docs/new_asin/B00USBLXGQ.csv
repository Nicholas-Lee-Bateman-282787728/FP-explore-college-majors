7071004,3,B00USBLXGQ,"I thought the movie was mildly interesting. It's hard to say what it was about. I think the secret was that a group of girls decided to reject online social websites; maybe because they were bored with them. And it showed how one person can set off a major controversy where there really isn't a controversy, just by using one using the very thing the Sisterhood has embraced. The acting was good.",1429401600,,397,4.527777777777778
7071005,5,B00USBLXGQ,I LOVE this movie! It's friggin' awesome!! Good actresses!!,1429142400,,59,5.666666666666667
7071006,5,B00USBLXGQ,This film is a must see! Share it with the teens in your life or better yet watch it together. It hits home with a great message and does not hold back in regards to what some teens go through in the digital world we live in.,1428883200,7,225,3.8085106382978724

7071008,5,B00USBLXGQ,"A touching story about friendship and keeping promises. I enjoyed the story and the element of mystery which made me want to know exactly what is this ""Sisterhood"" all about.  There was some adult like content that made my 11 year old daughters uncomfortable.  Would recommend for a little older audience.  Worth watching.",1428624000,7,322,5.037735849056604
7071009,5,B00USBLXGQ,"Anyone with teenage kids should see this movie. It dealt with the multi-media age and how it can affect kids in a thoughtful and poignant way without being in your face. It tells a story that, hopefully, will make kids think before posting things about other people on social media. As an adult, I liked the story, it had twists I didn't see coming.",1428624000,10,349,4.46875
7071010,5,B00USBLXGQ,"At first glance, The Sisterhood of Night echoes the cliches of Twilight and poorly produced neo-Wiccan Hollywood fare.

Instead, The Sisterhood of Night is a thoughtful glimpse into the unique time in our lives that is ruled by passion, pain, judgement, and self-discovery (adolescence).

The movie also provides a thoughtful commentary on the gulf between parent and child, the taboo of secrets, and the paranoid culture of safety we have built up around ourselves.

The acting of this cast, both young and old, was spot on.

The cinematography and soundtrack were both perfect for the mood of this film. Couldn't have asked for anything more from such a unique story. An unexpected hit! I hope more people discover this movie.  A+",1447718400,,732,5.016528925619835
7071011,1,B00USBLXGQ,I don't know how this movie got 4.5 rating - I thought it was terrible :(,1445731200,,73,3.625
7071012,5,B00USBLXGQ,It's was so suspenseful and I loved the acting!!! I defintely suggest watching this!,1444435200,,84,5.071428571428571
7071013,4,B00USBLXGQ,"I really enjoyed this movie, except I hated the ending.

A lot of this movie did not make sense.

But I enjoyed every minute of it, up until the ending.",1440201600,,152,4.033333333333333
7071014,5,B00USBLXGQ,"Frankly, there isn't a huge story here. Not a lot happens. So if you don't want to watch something slow, quiet, and thought-provoking, this is not for you. With that said, I absolutely could not look away from this film. The acting from every single character was spot-on and perfect, and the vibe of the film was spellbinding. Just a really unique look at adolescence. I loved it.",1436659200,,381,4.617647058823529
7071015,1,B00USBLXGQ,"I don't know how else to describe it... This movie an hour and forty minutes of scenes of teenagers and their moms. It portrays itself as a deep, artistic experience, but as you actually watch it, you realize it's nothing more than a mish-mash of barely related scenes, most of which are filmed in slow-mo (or presented in a slow fashion) that finally get around to telling a semblance of a story an entire hour and a half in. By the time anything legitimately emotional happens, you've already spent all that time fighting to stay awake and understand what's going on that it just doesn't carry any emotional weight.

I've seen reviews praising the acting... I'd like to ask what acting? There are some scenes of people crying, and I guess they look like they're crying realistically. But 90% of the movie is comprised of zoomed-in shots of the actors making serious or sad faces. There's very little real or meaningful dialogue, so it's not like they're nailin' their lines or anything.

Reviewers have cited the deep themes as the source of their high scores of the movie. What deep themes? I struggle to describe the vagaries of the themes in this movie; the best I can do is to describe them like the Sun at nighttime. You can see the light of the Sun reflected off the moon's surface... so you know the Sun's still there, but you can't see it, and you can't feel it's warmth, and it's essentially useless for all intents and purposes.

The ONLY redeemable part of this movie was the soundtrack, which featured a few catchy songs.

Skip this garbage at all costs.",1436054400,2,1568,4.60931899641577
7071016,1,B00USBLXGQ,So awful.,1435536000,,9,4.0
7071017,3,B00USBLXGQ,"Has no one seen that this is simply a modern day ""salem witch trial"".  Even the names have remained the same (i.e. Mary Warren).  I'm kinda sad I fell for the 5 star reviews....",1435276800,3,177,4.176470588235294
7071018,5,B00USBLXGQ,"I really loved this movie and the allusion to the witch trials. The mysterious nature of the sisterhood kept me interested throughout. Things unfold in a way where you start to see this secret society isn't what it's made out to be. I'd say it manages to tie the dangers of lying (particularly on the internet), the desire to fit in and belong, and the strengths (and weaknesses) of silence, exclusivity, and secrecy all into a really neat little bow. There's also themes of forgiveness and truth that's shown nicely. It shows that silence and secrecy loses some of it strength when it's challenged by lies. I'm 15 but I think this is a movie adults can enjoy and take something from too.",1435276800,,688,4.6016260162601625
7071019,4,B00USBLXGQ,"Sisterhood of Night is an interesting movie. Basically a group of girls form a secret society where they all take a vow of silence. One girl, who desperately wants to be a member, follows the group to their secret meeting and writes of her blog about what supposedly took place. Soon their town believes the group are modern witches practicing sex.

Now if this sounds disturbing to you, believe me, it did to me to. While there is a bit of mild sex talk, that's all it is. There is no sex seen, so no worries there. But after watching the trailer, I was genuinely nervous about watching the movie. But I did so (if only for the sake of seeing Georgie Henley).

And I have to say I was honestly surprised! I was the confused (and a little horrified, truth be told) the whole time trying to figure out how all of these random glimpses, snippets, fantasies and scenes that were cut just a little too short, all fit together. But by the end of the film, I realized that I just watched something beautiful.

I don't like everything about it, but I thought the story was beautiful, the directing was nothing short of perfection, and dare I say, Olivia DeJonge needs to become a huge star! Shes amazing! Lavinia was definitely my favorite character (next to Mr. Gambhir).

I would say try it. It comes off like a Lifetime movie, but it really is something special. Much better than Perfect Sisters!",1434931200,4,1392,4.490118577075099

7071023,5,B00USBLXGQ,Loved this movie.  This movie shows that things aren't always what they seem and does a great job portraying bullying in the cyber world.  The ending was incredible!,1432857600,,165,4.857142857142857
7071024,5,B00USBLXGQ,"This movie has depth of meaning and emotion and it's cloaked in mystery but is a very well expressed coming of age film for teens In This Internet age. I love the cinematography of the Kingston NY locale, and the layering of lives loss grief and joy",1432598400,,249,4.319148936170213
7071025,5,B00USBLXGQ,"This movie had a little bit of everything. I enjoyed it way more than i thought i would. Anyone can relate to this movie. There is something to love about each character also. It was actually more of an inspirational mystery than scary,although im trying not to give away anything. Definitely a must-see.",1431734400,2,304,4.754716981132075

7071028,5,B00USBLXGQ,"One of the best films about the pain of being a teenager and growing up.  Although ""The Sisterhood of Night"" may serve as a cautionary tale regarding the pitfalls and potential dangers of social media outlets, that's not what this film is about; to focus on the hazards of modern-day social media is to miss the point of this film. Since time out of mind - long before the Internet - the teenage years have always been fraught with pain, insecurity, longings, worries about what the future may bring, and an intense need to belong.  Beautifully written, well-acted, and directed with great sensitivity, ""The Sisterhood of Night"" is poignant without degenerating into cheap, maudlin sentimentality. It is deeply moving.  Highly recommended for teenage girls and their parents.",1430092800,11,775,5.086614173228346
7071029,5,B00USBLXGQ,"Hands down - this is one movie that everyone should see.  It deals with the problem of bullying and denunciation in modern cyber world.  A serious problem tackled by talented filmmakers.  Depressing serious events leads to an uplifting, optimistic ending.",1429660800,3,255,5.325
8708162,5,B00USBLXGQ,"I LOVED this film, and am surprised it has not become a cult classic. A beautifully woven tale about coming of age in the digital age, and the power of community. A deep and ultimately joyful journey!",1509148800,,200,4.4324324324324325
8708163,3,B00USBLXGQ,"I would give this 3.5 stars if I could. This is an unusual movie about teenage relationships, rumors, bullying, social media, and adults who enable. As an adult remembering her teen years, I did like how it accurately it shows girls who are so sure they are superior to all the panicky, clueless adults and petty classmates. I remember feeling that way as a teen. As a parent, I also see how the girls misjudge when secrecy needs to be trumped by something more important, like community panic, media stories and someone losing their job. As a viewer, I like the suggestion in the movie that the girls if girls are not listened to, is silence left as their only method of control and integrity and would telling the truth even be recognized as such? The actress cast as Mary is perfect - with saying a word, she can both draw people to her while also holding herself superior to and apart from others. She has expressions that make her seem both admirable and deceptive at the same time. You can see how no one knows whether to trust her - some see her best and some her worst, at the very same time. But ultimately, I didn't find the movie very enjoyable. There isn't much music, a lot of scenes are shot in the dark, and the girls are so unhappy at school and with their families. They only smile and laugh on occasion when with their friends, and that is usually shot in slow mo and in silence. I had to rewind a lot if my attention strayed. The movie takes itself so seriously - I don't think anyone in this town does something as mundane as grocery shop or homework or get stuck in traffic. They all emote and argue and spy and look moody - even the adults.  I did not get a lot out of the final supposedly uplifting scene. In terms of questionable content, not much is shown in this movie but a lot is referred to. There are a few shots of girls in just their bras, one sad scene of online bullying, three scenes where girls take prescription medications to self-medicate, one scene that seems to lead to sex (not shown), a suicide and many quick references to sexual abuse, student-teacher relationships, cutting, eating disorders, not going down on a boy, etc. Again, almost all of this is in dialogue rather than anything shown. I think the movie is best for ages 14 and up.",1505779200,,2283,4.397163120567376
8708164,5,B00USBLXGQ,Georgie is one of my favorite actresses.,1501459200,,40,4.857142857142857
8708165,5,B00USBLXGQ,Excellent film.  It is NOT the cliched film that it might first appear to be.  Very sensitive and subtle story.,1488326400,,111,4.5
8708166,5,B00USBLXGQ,Amazing movie. It shows the toubles of bullying and resembles the boy who cried wolf. Its a fantastic movie that i watch 3 times a week because i love it. I would highly recomend this to anyone who has dealt with bullying or just wants a nice movie to watch.,1487635200,,258,4.18
8708167,5,B00USBLXGQ,"I've seen this movie before, I think online.  I'm a fan of Georgie Henley and even though she's British she does an excellent American accent.  I remember seeing the trailer for this on TV and thought it was a modern day version of The Crucible.  You find out when you watch it isn't and some people end up being disappointed because of that.  I really enjoyed this movie though.  It takes me back in time to my high school days when girls just wanted to fit in somewhere.  Kids can be cruel and this movie portrays that as well, I'm trying to avoid any spoilers.  I see lots of negative reviews and most of that is due to people not understanding what's going on, especially at the end.  I thought the ending was obvious so I guess I'll have to spell it out for people who can't see what's happening.  It's a tribute to their friend, Lavinia (who died).  That was their dance for the school show which was cancelled.  The theme was about spirit animals, they say so when they arrive at her house and are in her room.

Anyway, I know this movie has been out for a while but I only recently decided to get it on DVD.  I highly recommend this movie.",1480377600,,1147,4.25462962962963
