3623411,4,B001H5X6SK,"I have seen it on WWE 24/7 already and the match selection is pretty good must say.

Disc 1
Starrcade December 29, 1996 - The Match of the Decade
""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan: It was their first match in WCW and before it, there was never a winner in their matches by submission or pin fall. It was a decent main event due it being the first time as Hollywood Hogan that he actually lost and it was nice to see back then since Hogan was a good heel and very annoying. It's also nice to see it on dvd, it's actually better than the over-rated Hogan vs Sting Starcade match. Basically because Hogan never put over Sting clean, he at least puts over Piper here without making him look bad in the process like he did with Sting. It's also better than any of the Hogan vs Piper matches that followed.

Starrcade December 13, 1989 - Iron Man Singles Tournament
Sting vs. The Great Muta. Sting and Muta always had good matches and this one wasn't bad but I've seen better between them.

Starrcade December 28, 1992 - Unified World Tag Team Championship
Barry Windham / Brian Pillman vs. Ricky Steamboat / Shane Douglas: The tag team match selection is pretty good. This one takes place before the Hollywood Blonds were formed and before the classic steel cage tag team battle between the Blonds and Steamboat and Douglas. Barry Windham and Pillman made a pretty good team as well though, so this match was pretty good.

Starrcade December 27, 1998 - WCW World Heavyweight Championship
Goldberg vs. Kevin Nash: After all the hype and after Goldberg finally losing, Nash after feuding with Hogan for months just lays down and lets him win the title either a day or week later. It didn't make sense and still doesn't. It took the fun out of seeing Nash Jack Knife Goldberg and win the title. But other than that, this was a decent big man vs big man match.

Starrcade December 29, 1991
BattleBowl

Starrcade December 27, 1993 - 2 out of 3 Falls for the WCW United States Championship
Dustin Rhodes vs. Stunning Steve Austin: I think Dustin Rhodes had much better matches in WCW in his early career than he ever had as Goldust. This match is proof of that.

Disc 2
Starrcade November 26, 1987 - NWA World Tag Team Championship
Road Warriors vs. Arn Anderson / Tully Blanchard
Alternate Commentary: Todd Grisham / Road Warrior Animal

Starrcade December 29, 1996
Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Jushin Thunder Liger: A classic cruiserweight match. I know that some fans would disagree but WCW did way more better things for cruiserweights and the title than the WWE ever did. I mean the WWE recently just got rid of the title and cruiserweights all together. While Hornswoggle of all people was the last champion. Anyway, just watch this match.

Starrcade November 26, 1987 - Scaffold Match
Rock `n Roll Express vs. The Midnight Express

Starrcade December 26, 1988 - NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger

Starrcade December 27, 1995
Eddie Guerrero vs. Shinjiro Ootani: Another example of what great cruiserweight action is all about.

Starrcade December 26, 1988 - NWA World Tag Team Championship
Dusty Rhodes / Sting vs. Road Warriors

Starrcade December 28, 1992 - King of Cable Tournament Final
Sting vs. Big Van Vader: Bischoff  couldn't wait to fire Vader, those words came out of his own mouth. That alone shows that he didn't appreciate the talent that were working for him. Vader was certainly a lot less of a lazy big man than Kevin Nash. He had many classic battles with Sting and this is one of them.

Starrcade November 24, 1983 - NWA World Tag Team Championship
Brisco Brothers vs. Jay Youngblood / Ricky Steamboat

Starrcade November 28, 1985 - NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Dusty Rhodes vs. Ric Flair

Starrcade December 28, 1997 - WCW Cruiserweight Championship
Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko: Awesome match, just like all of their matches were. If these 2 faced in the WWE I wouldn't remember because Malenko was wasted there.

Disc 3
Starrcade December 13, 1989 - Iron Man Tag Team Tournament
Road Warriors vs. The Steiner Brothers: Say what you will about Scott Steiner but back in the day he was one of the most athletic and most fun guys to watch in the ring. Well before he became Big Poppa Steroid. Anyway the Steiners and the Road Warriors were 2 tag team of the best and this was one of their better matches against each other.

Starrcade December 17, 2000 - Ladder Match for a Contract for the World Cruiserweight Championship
3 Count vs. Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias vs. Jung Dragons: This one is a good ladder match but it be seen on the Ladder match dvd already. I think DDP vs Hennig should have been on this dvd instead of this one. DDP actually was a WCW legend yet, he doesn't have one match this dvd.

Starrcade December 13, 1989 - Iron Man Singles Tournament
Sting vs. Ric Flair: Sting won the same way he did a year later when he took the title from Flair. However, I actually think this one is more of a classic match and one of their best.

Starrcade November 24, 1983 - Dog Collar Match
Greg Valentine vs. Roddy Piper: All I can tell you is that one was a pretty violent battle between the 2.

Starrcade November 27, 1986 - Scaffold Match
Road Warriors vs. The Midnight Express
Alternate Commentary: Todd Grisham / Road Warrior Animal

Starrcade December 28, 1997 - WCW World Heavyweight Championship
Sting vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan: Hogan had creative power and was a selfish %%## when it comes to this match or any of his matches with Sting. I mean we waited longer than a year to see Sting kick Hogan's ass, yet Hogan made sure he was the one who came out looking better even though he lost.

  I mean it was obvious that the 3 count wasn't fast by Nick Patrick, like Bret Hart says, when Hogan hit the leg drop on Sting. So it basically came off as if Hogan was screwed over. Hell it came off as if Hogan was screwed over every time Sting ever beat him. When Hogan came in 1994, Sting was already stuck in his shadow after he helped make WCW. Hogan just couldn't let him come off as looking better, which is also why he never got in the ring with Bret. He was selfish and just couldn't put Bret over as well, instead he just stuck him in his shadow in the NWO. He even chose to lose the WWE title to Yokozuna instead of having a match with Bret at SummerSlam 1993. I'm done rambling lol, this match is just big because it was their first one on one match at a PPV and like I said, we waited more than a year to see Sting take the title from Hogan. The end is weak though.

Starrcade November 24, 1983 - Steel Cage Match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Ric Flair vs. Harley Race: Flair's first time winning the big one, of course it's a classic.

Starrcade November 28, 1985 - Steel Cage ""I Quit Match"" for the NWA United States Championship
Magnum T.A. vs. Tully Blanchard: This one was very bloody and one of the most brutal matches.

Starrcade December 27, 1993 - WCW World Heavyweight Championship - Ric Flair's Career Is On the Line
Ric Flair vs. Vader: This one wasn't bad even though I think Sting had better matches with Vader than anyone in WCW.

  In closing, I wish the dvd actually had a Rick Rude match though, to me he was one of the best heels to ever be in WCW even if his wrestling career there was only like 3 or 4 years. I also think it could have used a Hennig, DDP or Bret Hart match. I will probably get laughed at for this but I actually think that Luger vs the Giant at Starcade 1996 should have  been included. Just because Luger actually got him up for the Torture Rack, I remember it just for that. Sting in the WCW vs Japan finals at Starcade 1995 was also memorable. I can't think of the name of who he versed but it was a pretty good match.",1229644800,2,7744,4.45789101203114
3623412,3,B001H5X6SK,Sting nevered worked for Vince and his face represents the forefront of the cover. I am sure he had to have Sting's permission before putting his picture on the cover.,1228780800,,167,4.6
3623413,3,B001H5X6SK,"All of these matches were shown on WWE 24/7 recently, and to be honest, I'm disappointed in the matches that were selected.  If you ever saw Starrcade '86, then you ought to be scratching your head wondering why the cage match between the Andersons and the Rock & Roll Express wasn't included in this collection (easily an all-time top 5 Starrcade match).  Also, Rick Steamboat vs. Tully Blanchard from Starrcade '84 was another great match, and that wasn't included in this collection, which is beyond me why it wasn't included.  I think the best Starrcade match collection that was ever put together was the ""Best of Starrcade"" VHS release back in 1988 that included matches from the first five Starrcades.",1228521600,,708,4.883333333333334
3623414,3,B001H5X6SK,"Nwa/Wcw has had many legendary matches through Starrcade that would have made this collection essential. Some examples would be Garvin Verses Flair, Abdulah The Butcher verses Manny Fernandez as well as other matches from its storied past would have made this collection more enjoyable. Although I am greatful for this dvd being created, I just wish that they would have considered adding more legendary matches to this collection. I will end up buying the dvd because I love the old Nwa/Wcw days, but judging off of the list of matches in a previous review, I think that the match selection could have been better. Overall, this collection is okay for me, but could have chosen more legendary matches to add in this collection.",1227657600,,728,4.926829268292683
3623415,4,B001H5X6SK,"UPDATE 2/5/09

I just purchased this in my local store and let me say that, for the most part, WWE did a good job. My only wish is that the documentary would've been longer and that they could've gotten people who were actually around back then like Jim Crockett, Jr., Tony Schivone, Vader, Ricky Steamboat and others. I also would've liked to have heard more from guys like Barry Windham, especially on his Starrcade '92 bout with Brian Pillman. On the other hand, it was great to hear from Magnum T.A.! This will probably be the closest we'll ever get to a documentary on him. If you want more on him, I'd recommend getting the Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen DVD set. The most heartening about this whole deal is that the commentary of Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura is LEFT intact! Finally, WWE got it right on that score!

As for the matches, I know these bouts were voted on but there are a few that don't belong on this set and at least two that are missing! I'll explain along the way while I review the lineup:

""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan - Contrary to the billing, it wasn't the match of the decade! It wasn't even the match of the night on this particular Starrcade. It is significant because it was Piper and Hogan's first one on one face off on PPV. Beyond that, its not a great match as there were several on this card alone that were better. Even Lex Luger Vs. The Giant that night was better! If you want a good Hogan Vs. Piper bout, get their old 1985 ""War To Settle The Score"" bout that led to the first WrestleMania!

Sting vs. The Great Muta - This one was part of the round robin IronMan tournament. While not as classic as their Great American Bash '89 match, it was still a good bout and does belong on here.

Barry Windham / Brian Pillman vs. Ricky Steamboat / Shane Douglas - This one DEFINITELY belongs on here and the main reason I will buy this set! It belongs on anyone's ""Best Of"" list as far as tag team matches go. This one is a ""must see""!

Goldberg vs. Kevin Nash - This one was from Starrcade '98 and is only noteworthy because it was Goldberg's first offical loss. The match itself is only okay. It does belong but barely!

BattleBowl - Belongs because it was the first one and it happened at Starrcade.

Dustin Rhodes vs. Stunning Steve Austin - Good bout and arguably one of the better ones from Starrcade '93. Belongs!

Disc 2
Road Warriors vs. Arn Anderson / Tully Blanchard - While a great tag team match and it is worthy to be on this set, I personally would've left this one off since its already available on the Road Warriors' release ""The Life And Death Of Wrestling's Most Dominant Tag Team"". My personal pick would've been The Midnight Express Vs. The ""Original"" Midnight Express from Starrcade '88.

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Jushin Thunder Liger - While known for high flying wrestling, this actually featured some good ground wrestling from both Mysterio and Liger. Definitely belongs and may have been the show stealer for Starrcade '96.

Rock `n Roll Express vs. The Midnight Express - Other than the fact that its a scaffold match, this is probably one of the weakest Rock n Roll Vs. Midnight battles! My personal replacement would've been The R n R's Vs. Ivan & Nikita Koloff from Starrcade '85!

Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger - This is from Starrcade '88 and this one is a VERY worthy piece for this set! Believe me, its worth the 30 minutes or so to watch! Want to see the best of Lex Luger? You'll get it here and of course, Flair is the man! WHOOOOOO!

Eddie Guerrero vs. Shinjiro Ootani - Again, this one is already available on The Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero set. That being said, it is a worthy match to be on here!

Dusty Rhodes / Sting vs. Road Warriors - This one is already on Dusty Rhodes' set that came out a few years ago and this one isn't all that. I personally would've replaced this one with Barry Windham/Arn Anderson Vs. DOOM in a streetfight from Starrcade '90.

Sting vs. Big Van Vader - Definitely belongs! The best Sting Vs. Vader battle ever!

Brisco Brothers vs. Jay Youngblood / Ricky Steamboat - Though already on the ""Most Powerful Families In Wrestling"" set, this one belongs too!

Dusty Rhodes vs. Ric Flair - My favorite Dusty/Flair battle! Again, this one is already on ""Ultimate Ric Flair"" but this one belogns.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko - This one is on ""The Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero"" set. While a good match, these two have had better battles at Starrcade against other opponents. I would've voted for Dean Malenko Vs. Ultimo Dragon from Starrcade '96 here.

Disc 3
Road Warriors vs. The Steiner Brothers - One of the stiffest matches I've ever seen! You'll say ouch on some of the hits! This one belongs!

3 Count vs. Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias vs. Jung Dragons - This one is already on ""The Ladder Match"" set but it belongs.

Sting vs. Ric Flair - Sting and Flair's only Starrcade showdown (I don't count that Black Scorpion mess at Starrcade '90) and it was a good one! Not the level of their Clash Of Champions match but very good. Belongs!

Greg Valentine vs. Roddy Piper - This was hardcore before hardcore became in vogue! Brutal encounter and definitely belongs!

Road Warriors vs. The Midnight Express - Already on the Road Warriors' set but definitely belongs.

Sting vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan - THE worst Starrcade match ever! I don't care if it did record numbers, this one is terrible! Look at it once just to see how terrible it was! If pro wrestling was a religion, then Sting, Hogan and WCW management committed supreme blasphemy that night! Put it this way, I'd rather watch Lawrence Taylor Vs. Bam Bam Bigelow from WrestleMania 11! That's how much I hate this match! If any of these matches deserved to be voted off of the ""Starrcade"" island, then its this one!

Sorry for the rant but I can't believe people actually voted this bout onto this set.

Ric Flair vs. Harley Race - Another repeat but hey, it was one that started it all for Ric Flair and this event as a whole so it belongs.

Magnum T.A. vs. Tully Blanchard - Though a repeat from another WWE set, this one belongs as this was another bout that was hardcore before its time! The ending would've had me saying ""I Quit"" or whatever Magnum wanted me to say! LOL!

Ric Flair vs. Vader - Definitely belongs. Not a great match but it does show the dominance of Vader and Flair's unwillingness to surrender. Not a great finish but it was still good to see Flair win.

Overall, this is a good set, especially for those that have never seen these matches.  There are two matches that I think should've been on here. One I get why it wouldn't be, the other I don't get why it isn't. Here they are:

Jeff Jarrett Vs. Chris Benoit - I get two reasons why this one isn't on here. One was the obvious one (Benoit himself). The other is Jeff Jarrett because he works for their competition (TNA). Sad because this was a classic Ladder match. If you can get past the fact that one of the wrestlers is Chris and have access to a VHS and a copy of Starrcade '99, then see it and see why I still think its one of the greatest Starrcade bouts ever.

Bret Hart Vs. Goldberg - This is the one I can't understand why its not on here. I know, I know. It was a vote but still, this one definitely belongs because it was Bret's final PPV appearance as an active performer. While not one of Bret's best bouts, it was definitely one of Goldberg's best bouts and miles better than Nash Vs. Goldberg!

Overall, this is a good one to get and (for me anyway) it was worth it just to get the extra commentary by the wrestlers that were there during that time. And it was great to see Magnum! Could've been better in a lot of ways BUT I won't protest much. One of WWE's better buys.",1227484800,,7724,4.394109396914446

3623432,5,B001H5X6SK,"Well, another trip down memory lane and what I always call ""the good old days"" of wrestling--particularly, the days when the old NWA/WCW was around. But--instead of focusing on the great Monday Night Wars--this collection covers the scope of what was the NWA/WCW premiere event, Starrcade.

As the documentary on Disc 1 covers, Starrcade was created with the intention of being the NWA's version of the Super Bowl--a tradition that started out being an annual Thanksgiving event, but later--due to some finagling by one Vincent Kennedy McMahon--Starrcade being moved to the month of December and how the event evolved over the years. Particularly, I enjoyed hearing Dusty Rhodes talking about the changes Starrcade went through & how Big Dust--in his own words--talking about how in the early 90s when WCW bought out the NWA & how there were people behind the scenes who didn't know ""jack-bleep"" about wrestling.

As for the matches themselves, I would say it was a mostly excellent choice of matches. Of course--as with any WWE wrestling collection that has come out on DVD--you can always question some of the matches that get included. For instance, how the hell did Sting vs. Hogan from 1997 get included as being one of the Top 5 Starrcade matches of all-time. I could go on for days about how badly WCW botched that match, but I won't bother.

Focusing on the good, this DVD is Ric Flair heavy--which is always a good thing, as Flair in his prime could pull a 4 or 5 star match out of just about anybody; just see Flair's '88 battle with Luger. And Flair's epic battles with Harley Race, Dusty Rhodes, Big Van Vader and the list goes on.

Overall--if you enjoy the glory days of wrestling--then this is a must have. 5 stars",1447113600,2,1729,4.753333333333333

3623471,5,B001H5X6SK,"So, I was looking through some of my dvd sets and realized I have never done a review of this set.  So here it is.  The set does start off with a documentary which is kind of short but still worth seeing.  Vince actually doesn't appear in the doc which takes away from it a bit (I was interested in hearing what he thought about Starrcade) but it is still fun to watch.  After that we get a countdown of the 25 greatest Starrcade matches as voted on by the fans.

First up is from 1996 is it's Hollywood Hogan taking on Roddy Piper.  A lot of people give this match some grief but I like it.  I think that it is fun and really you have to understand for someone like me who was only like 4 or 5 when they had their big feud in the WWE and can't remember what happened, this was fun to watch.  It was slow in some spots but still good.  One thing I still can't figure out is why the WCW would basically sell this PPV just on them two wrestling and no world title on the line.  Still worth checking out.

The next match is from the 1989 Starrcade between Sting and Great Muta.  So in 1989 NWA decided to hold a four man and four team Iron Man Tournament.  All matches were 15 minutes and would be decided by points (a certain amount for pinfall, DQ, countout, etc).  Kind of an entertaining idea (not so much for the tag portion but the singles portion was on point).  This match was entertaining and fun.  These two always had great contests and this one was no different.  Although I do prefer some of their Japanese matches and the Great American Bash 1989 match over this one, it does still hold its own.

The next match is from 1992 (the Starrcade that is my favorite one BTW) and features Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas taking on Barry Windham and Brian Pillman for the Unified tag titles.  Awesome match!  Back and forth action, moves that kept you on the edge of your seat and 4 of the best in the WCW at the time.  Really fun to watch.

The next match is for the WCW world title in 1998 and features Goldberg taking on Kevin Nash.  The match is good but the outcome is so stupid.  Apparently Nash was like the head booker at the time or had some stroke within the company at the time and decided to put the belt on himself and end Goldberg's undefeated streak.  Bad move!  It irriated the fans and gave them nothing else to talk about (as WCW was now starting to fade).  At least with Goldberg undefeated that was still something worth talking about and something worth seeing.  Still, the match itself is good and exciting until the end.

Up next we have a match from the Starrcade in 1991 which was known for its Lethal Lottery.  Basically they would pick 2 guys out of a pot and they would be a team and take on two other guys (the premise being that regular tag teamers would face each other or enemies would have to team together) and they would wrestle.  Whichever team won would move on to a battle royal called battlebowl.  That's the match you get to see, the battle royal.  It is a good match but kind of confusing.  See there's two rings and basically you can't be eliminated out of the first ring (out of the match).  You have to be eliminated into the second ring.  Once there if you are eliminated then you leave the match.  After one guy is left in ring 1 and one in ring 2 then they battle to see who wins.  Good match just bad rules.

Disc one ends with the 2/3 falls match for the US title in 1993 between Steve Austin and Dustin Rhodes.  Great match!  Really fun to watch.  Back and forth action.  We even see the lights go out in the arena for a bit.  There's blood and a cool title change.  Fun to see where these two would end up character wise in the WWE.  One guy would become maybe the biggest star the WWE ever had and the other would become maybe the most bizarre.

Disc 2 begins with a match from 1987 for the tag titles between the Road Warriors and Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard.  Great match (almost a dream match) but a real bad DQ ending.  I wanted to see a clear cut victor and it just wasn't in the cards.  Still worth checking out.

Up next is a classic from 1996 between Rey Mysterio and Jushin Liger.  This was a dream match for anyone who loves Jr Heavyweights.  So good, maybe the best match that year.  They went back and forth with each other and there were times when you honestly could not tell who was going to win.  This was the first time these two guys went at it and it may also be the last time (not sure if they met in Japan or not).  Well worth checking out.

Up next is another match from 1987 and is a Scaffold match between the Midnight Express and the Rock N Roll Express.  Two of the most underrated teams of all time going at it should be awesome right?  Not in this one.  I hate scaffold matches because you can't do a whole heck of a lot on them and they are a dangerous match (as Jim Cornette found out).  I would have rather seen these two teams just have a straight up wrestling match but I guess the NWA was just trying to sell the Starrcade show and decided to add this stipulation.  Bad move on their part.

The next match is a half hour classic between Ric Flair and Lex Luger from 1988.  Really really good match with Flair making Luger look like a million bucks.  It's often been said that Flair could make you or break you and it sure looks like he made Luger.  This match was off and running from the first bell.  People say a lot of bad things about Luger but he could hold his own when he wanted to and he did here.  Real good match.

The next match was from 1995 between Eddie Guerrero and Ohtani.  This Starrcade was kind of weird as the first 7 matches was a best of 7 series between WCW and New Japan.  This was perhaps the best match of those 7 and maybe the best match of the show.  These two put on a clinic.  The sad thing is that most people may not have even known who these two were before the match.  Great match and worth the price of the set all by itself.

Up next was another tag title match from 1988 between the Road Warriors and Sting and Dusty Rhodes.  This was such a hot feud at the time.  I can remember when the Warriors attacked Dusty with a spike off their shoulder pads and proceeded to try to tear his eye out.  That was insane stuff for the time.  This match was pretty good but not great.  Again, it had a weak DQ ending but if you're a fan of each of these guys then it is worth checking out.

The next match is from 1992 and is the King of Cable Finals between Vader and Sting.  These two always had great matches and this one was one of their best (although not on par with their strap match from 1993).  I never understood the whole King of Cable tournament but at least it led up to a great finals match.

The next match is from the first Starrcade in 1983 and features the Briscos defending their tag titles against Ricky Steamboat and Jay Youngblood.  This is a good match but not a great one.  I love Jack Brisco and Steamboat but never cared much for Jay or Gerry Brisco.  All in all it was just an okay match for me.

The next match is from 1985 and features the NWA world title being defended as Ric Flair takes on Dusty Rhodes.  Honestly, and I may be in the minority here, but I never thought these two had good matches.  This match was just okay to me.  It does feature (I think) the first ""Dusty finish.""  See the referee gets knocked out of the ring and the Horsemen hit the ring to help Flair.  Another referee comes out as Dusty fights them off.  The original ref sees all this and is signaling for the bell but no one sees him, so Dusty pins Flair and seemingly wins the title.  The next day Dusty gives the title back to Flair because the original ref was signaling for the DQ and because he was the assigned referee then they had to go with what he said.

The final match on Disc 2 is from 1997 for the Cruiserweight title and has Dean Malenko taking on Eddie Guerrero.  I have seen almost every match these two have ever had from their Japanese days to the ECW days to the WCW days to the WWE days and I have to say:  These two have never had a bad match ever!!!  Great match and probably the best on the show that year.  Again well worth seeing.

Disc 3 starts with a rip roaring match from that Iron man tournament in 1989 as the Road Warriors take on the Steiners.  These two teams may be ranked number one and two all time on most people's lists.  This is a fun match and is probably the best match of the tag portion of the show.  This was one that everyone sat up and took notice of.  Worth seeing.

Up next is a ladder match from 2000 and has 3 Count taking on Jamie Noble and Evan Karagis taking on the Jung Dragons.  Not sure why this match is on here.  It is an okay match but I think another classic Starrcade should have been on here instead.

The next match is another match from 1989 and has Ric Flair taking on Sting in the finals of the tournament.  Really good match.  Back and forth action in this one.  Both guys were fan favorites here so it was fun to see who the fans were rooting for.  Again, they only had 15 minutes to work with and they used almost every bit of it.  Basically both guys had to win by a pin or a submission to win the Iron man portion, anything else and Luger would have won.  It was a great edge of your seat match and the victory came with like 8 seconds left.  Great match.

Up next is a hardcore classic from the first Starrcade in 1983.  It is a dog collared match for the US title between Roddy Piper and Greg Valentine.  This match was hardcore before there was such a thing.  Very brutal and very bloody.  This was a big time feud at the time and what a way for finalize it.  Worth checking out cause its brutality still holds up.

Up next is another Scaffold match from 1986 and features the Road Warriors taking on the Midnight Express.  Again, this match was okay but nothing special.  This is another match that I wish would have been a regular match or a cage match or anything but a scaffold match.  The Cornette segment was fun to see though (he blows out both his knees legit).

The next match was for the WCW world title in 1997 and may be one of the most overhyped matches of all time.  It features Hollywood Hogan taking on Sting.  This match was hyped for over 13 months.  Sting was coming back for the first time in like 15 months.  He had been around but not really wrestling in all that time, just appearing in the rafters, or coming to whisper in someone's ear, etc.  The match itself is horrible.  It's dull and kind of slow.  The ending was supposed to have referee Nick Patrick doing a fast count but he doesn't!  Bret Hart who ref'd a match earlier in the night came out to say it was and restarted the match and Sting ends up winning.  It made everyone look stupid and was just a horrible way to end the show.  I think we all were wanting an exciting match with lots of drama and instead we didn't get that.

So, now it's time for the top 3 Starrcade matches of all time.  The first of those is from 1983 and is a world title match in a cage between Ric Flair and Harley Race.  Awesome match!  It has everything from wrestling to violence to brawling to blood.  Really great match and I feel it is the match that made Flair who he ended up being (the greatest of all time).  The only downside (if there is one) is the ref which is Gene Kiniski.  He ref's it old school and does kind of make the match dull at times but when you got Flair and Race in the match who cares!  These guys are great!

The next of those top 3 is another one of those hardcore style matches.  It was from 1985 and was for the US title.  It was an ""I Quit"" match held inside a cage.  It was a great battle as Tully Blanchard took on Magnum TA.  It was a hardcore match but something these guys did that is missing today is these guys could so expertly blend the violence with the wrestling.  Such a killer match.  And, when that wooden chair is introduced into the match, boy does it get interesting then!  This is another one of those great matches worth the price of the dvd set alone.

The final match was, I'll admit, a little suprising.  However, the drama of this match was unmistakable.  You had Ric Flair trying to win his 11th world title from the monster known as Vader.  Flair's career was on the line, his kids were there, his wife at the time was there and his fans were there.  What a great contest.  Also, how's this for irony:  Harley Race was in Vader's corner, the same man that Flair beat 10 years earlier in 1983 inside the cage.  This match had everything and then some.  Just a great way to end this dvd set.  Awesome match!!

So, all in all, I thought this was an outstanding dvd set when it was released and it's still good to this day.  Some of the matches that I wish we could have seen were:  Tully Blanchard taking on Ricky Steamboat from 1984, Dusty vs Luger in the cage from 1987, where's the love for 1990 and maybe showing Hansen taking on Luger in a lariat match, from 1993 I would have loved to have seen Sting and Hawk taking on the Nasty Boys in a half hour clinic, also would have liked to have seen Dean Malenko taking on Ultimo Dragon from 1996 and that's about it.  Even without these matches it is still a great set.",1383350400,,13240,4.141171844278412

3623495,5,B001H5X6SK,"The Essetial Starrcade Collection:

-Before there was Wrestlemania and what we know now as Pay-Per-View, the NWA and Jim Crockett Promotions put together the first ever closed circuit (which later became PPV) big fight card event of wrestling and throughout the incarnations during the NWA and WCW, Starrcade always had that big match and big fight atmosphere.

-There is a short 48 minute documentary showing the history of Starrcade from the NWA/Jim Crockett's beginnings, to the first show in '83, the first simul-cast in '85, where 2 events in 2 different places were going at the same time, while the crowd watched the other matches on a big screen. The '86 show is talked about and the tragedy that ended Magnum T.A.'s career just when he was about to achieve main event status in the NWA.

-The rest of the doc. involves the creation of WWE's Survivor Series that took place on Thanksgiving night, which was the night for Starrcade, that and other issues lead to financial problems and Crockett selling NWA to Ted Turner and the creation of WCW. The production values got better, but the booking and match concepts got more confusing than creative (i.e. The Iron Man Tournament and of course the infamous Battle Bowl).

-Ric Flair is at the forefront of the main event talk (love him or hate him he always delivered), his match against Vader from '93 is talked about and is one of the best big man/little man matches of the '90's. The Kevin Nash/Goldberg match is discussed mainly the poorly booked finish (in my opinion at least). There are comments from Dusty Rhodes, Ric Flair, Magnum T.A., Jim Ross, David Crockett (not the explorer... haha) among others, who talk about Starrcade's and the NWA's lineage.

-The matches are a Top 25 of the greatest in the history of Starrcade, from the NWA to WCW, even the later years. There are some good, some great and some well.... just bad (Sting/Hogan, anyone?)

#25-""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper Vs. Hulk Hogan, Match of the Icons, '96-This was a match people had been wanting to see for a while, unfortunately this was the result. Honestly a better brawl than anything else, not a lot of wrestling here. Both are great showmen and were also both past their prime at this point. There are a good amount of pauses and rest holds, but the crowd remained hot for the entire time, cheering loudly for the Rowdy one. The finish came when Piper got a sleeper hold on Hogan and was a laugh riot, courtesy of the referee's reaction to Hogan's arm going down for the third time for the winner, Roddy Piper in 15 minutes. 5/10 for the crowd reaction alone,

#24-Sting Vs. The Great Muta, Iron Man Tournament Match, '89-Depsite the convuluted point system and 15 minute time limit this is a great match on the countdown. Two of my favorites of all time, Sting in all his prime glory and Muta is and always will be one of my two or three favorite Japanese wrestlers of all time. Both men had already wrestled before and they still put on a great match again despite the time limit, high impact moves from both men, love the martial arts displayed by Muta. Sting eventually wins hitting a top rope superplex on Muta for the win in just under 9 minutes. 8/10.

#23-Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat & Shane Douglas (Champions) Vs. Barry Windham & Brian Pillman, Unified Tag Team Championship Match, '92-Great back and forth tag team match, plenty of heel tactics by Pillman and Windham, while Steamboat and Douglas try to get their revenge on both men, especially Windham for interrupting an interview and hitting both men with a chair. The action is fast paced and rarely slows down. Douglas with a belly to belly suplex on Pillman for the win in 20 minutes. Winners and still Unified Tag Team Champions, Ricky Steamboat & Shane Douglas. 9/10.

#22-Kevin Nash Vs. Goldberg (Champion), WCW World Championship Match, '98-A big man/bigger man match, that had that big fight feel to it with the main drawing points being Nash's reputation vs. Goldberg's undefeated streak and title. It was power versus power, both men hitting high impact power moves, the match overall was booked well, except for the finish. The fans were finally starting to turn on Goldberg at points during this match, even cheering the finish where there were run-ins by Disco Inferno, Bam Bam Bigelow and Scott Hall using a cattle prod on Goldberg. Nash hits the Jacknife powerbomb on Goldberg for the pin in 10 minutes. Winner and new WCW World Champion Kevin Nash. 6/10, cause of the poorly booked finish.

#21-BattleBowl '91-A 2 ring battle royal, 20 men start out, to be eliminated you must be dumped into ring two, then dumped over the top rope and both feet hit the floor, the last man remaining becomes the BattleBowl champion. If you're confused at all, don't worry it get more confusing when you see it executed. Funny to see some from their early days, like Steve Austin, Sting, Jushin Thunder Liger, Lex Luger, Scott Steiner among others. Its again a pretty convoluted match, just doesn't seem to flow that well most of the time. Sting and Luger eventually square off, Sting has to sell a lot to the slug that is Luger, the end comes with Sting eliminating Luger to become the first BattleBowl champion. 6/10.

#20-""Stunning"" Steve Austin Vs. ""The Natural"" Dustin Rhodes (Champion), 2 out of 3 Falls match for the United States Championship, '93-A classic throwback to the 2 out of 3 falls matchups from the old days of wrestling and a good one at that. Good to see both of these wrestlers before they became the mega stars later in their careers, more Austin than Rhodes though. Good wrestling and brawling by both men, Austin wins the first fall in 14 mins. when Rhodes dumps him over the top rope for a dq (a stupid rule). Austin wins the second fall by tripping up Dustin off the top rope and grabbing the tights for the win in 3 mins. Winner and new U.S. Champion Stunning Steve Austin. 6/10

#19-The Road Warriors Vs. Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard (Champions), NWA Tag Team Championship Match, '87-The crowd was on fire for this entire match and when you watch it you can see why. Animal and Hawk were virtually unstoppable monsters while Anderson & Blanchard played the great stick and move and cheat type heels that they're so famous for being. Animal and Hawk hit the Doomsday clothesline for the pin in 13 mins. but the decision is reversed cause Animal dumped Anderson over the top rope prior to the move. Winners by DQ and still Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard. 8/10.

#18-Rey Mysterio Jr. & Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger, '96-A major league leap above at least half the matches on the countdown. A dream match of sorts, plenty of great moves and counters from both men, lots of high spots from both, though a more delibriate style from Liger than his previous U.S. matches. The commentary is funny if not overloaded, Dusty Rhodes, Mike Tenay, Tony Schiavone and the great Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan. Liger wins with the Liger Bomb in 14 mins. Fantastic match, 10/10

#17-The Midnight Express vs. The Rock N Roll Express, Scaffold Match, '87-There are two opinions on this type of match, slow and plodding or intense and suspenseful. I fall under the second category, while not scientific matches they have suspense cause one wrong move could lead to disaster. I mean seriously how do you learn to fall from a scaffold to the ring below and not get hurt, you don't. This match is a good one, not as good as the one from '86 with the Road Warriors, but it had some good spots and brawling by all four men. It is short though, maybe 9 minutes, but the scare factor is there. The after match portion is a nice bonus too. Winners The Rock N Roll Express. 6/10.

#16-Lex Luger Vs. Ric Flair (Champion), NWA World Heavyweight Championship, '88-This was an awesome match by both men, yes Luger had good matches in him, there I said it. Flair did what he does better than anyone, he brings out the best in anyone he wrestles, and Luger kept pace with him throughout the whole match. Plenty of power moves by Luger and even some scientific wrestling, coupled with cheating by Flair along with being the great showman he is makes for a fantastic match. The crowd was hot for the whole time, and there were several times it felt like Luger would win. Flair ended up winning via pinfall with his feet on the ropes in about 31 mins. Winner and still NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Ric Flair. 10/10

#15-Eddie Guerrero Vs. Shinjiro Ootani, '95-This was during the before mentioned New Japan/WCW World Cup storyline and while a good match, and maybe I'm in the minority here but it didn't seem to fully click for me. There's some very good chain wrestling here, though the announcers at times seem more interested in bantering rather than paying attention to the match. Eddie hits a nice snap powerbomb and a brainbuster both for a 2 count. Nice dive by Ootani to the outside on Eddie. The energy just seems to be lacking in the match and the crowd, Ootani reverses a roll-up for the win. 6/10.

#14-The Road Warriors (Champions) Vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sting, NWA World Tag Team Championship Match, '88-Classic tag team match here, power team vs. power team. Nice to see the Road Warriors play heels here, while Dusty and Sting do their best and try everything to take the tag titles from them. Sting had the match won with a top rope splash onto Animal, but Paul Ellering interfered causing the Road Warriors to be DQ'd after 12 mins. of non stop excitement. Winners via DQ, Dusty Rhodes & Sting. 8/10

#13-Sting Vs. Big Van Vader, King of Cable Tournament Final, '92-These two always meshed well together, Sting had so much energy at this time he couldn't contain it, which worked well for him. Vader in his prime was one of the few big men who could look like a dominate monster but also make his opponent look like a million bucks. Vader uses his power and strength to his advantage, while Sting shows his own strength and quickness in battling the monster from the Rocky Mountains. The back and forth action is well paced and the crowd is on fire for Sting through the whole match. Sting wins when catches Vader in a powerslam for the pin in about 14 mins. Winner Sting. 10/10

#12-The Brisco Brothers (Champions) Vs. Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat & Jay Youngblood, NWA World Tag Team Championship Match, '83-Good match, with good chain wrestling by all four men. Both Briscoes were great technical wrestlers with well known amateur backgrounds, while Steamboat and Youngblood were the quicker team. Steamboat was always a great worker in the ring as was Youngblood, its a shame he died as young as he did. The crowd really pops loudly for the finish which saw Steamboat lift Yougnblood up for a splash on Gerry Brisco for the win in 12 mins. Winners and new NWA World Tag Team Champions, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat & Jay Youngblood. 7/10.

#11-Ric Flair (Champion) Vs. Dusty Rhodes, NWA World Championship Match, '85-Classic rivalry and a good match here, crowd was white hot for Dusty to beat Flair. Plenty of charisma displayed by both men in the opening moments and throughout the match honestly. The chemistry they had with each other was just magic, from bell to bell, regardless of match length. The action whether fast and furious or mat based was well done throughout the whole match. Despite outside interference from Ole & Arn Anderson, Dusty wins with a small package for the win in 21 mins. Winner and the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dusty Rhodes. 8/10

#10-Eddie Guerrero (Champion) Vs. Dean Malenko, WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match, '97-I have yet to see a bad televised match between these 2. As for this match, both men displayed a much more aggressinve style, very physical which made this very enjoyable. This match is another classic, Eddie was a great heel back at this time, even despite his drug problems, he was able to perform better than just about anyone in the ring. Malenko in his prime was one of the best wrestlers especially in the cruiserweight division. Eddie hits the Frogsplash for the win in 15 mins. Winner and still WCW Cruiserweight Champion, Eddie Guerrero. 9/10

#9-The Road Warriors Vs. The Steiner Brothers, Iron Man Tournament Tag Team Match, '89-Two of the biggest and most popular tag teams ever face off in a dream match for its time, still is nice to see today. The action is pretty fast and furious due to the 15 min. time limit, which in my opinion both hurts and helps this match. Helps cause the action is fast paced and well done but at the same time it hurts it some cause it feels rushed. The finish is well done as Hawk hits a clotheline from the top on Scott Steiner as Animal hits a back suplex, both men's shoulders were down on the mat but Scott got his shoulder up at the last second for the win in about 8 mins. Winners The Steiner Brothers. 7/10

#8-3 Count Vs. Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias Vs. Jung Dragons, Triple Threat Ladder Match, '00-Three teams, one goal, climb the ladder and which ever man grabs the contract at the top of the ladder wins a WCW Cruiserweight title shot against Chavo Guerrero Jr. Its a tad confusing I guess but putting three high flying tag teams in a ladder match is always a recipe for a great match if done right. Boy was this done right, it was little more than a spotfest but boy what a spotfest it was. Tons of spots including Kaz Hayashi of the Dragons takes a couple of sick hits on the head but he keeps going. Shane Helms & Shannon Moore both grab the contract at the same time for the win in about 15 mins. Winners, 3 Count. 10/10

#7-Sting Vs. Ric Flair, Iron Man Tournament Finals, '89-These two never had a bad match against each other and this one is no exception. Both men in their prime, Sting's energy and both men's charisma make for an awesome albeit short encounter due to the 15 min. time limit. Flair works on Sting's leg while Sting just uses his strength and energy to take it to Ric. Sting takes this one in the final seconds with an inside cradle to win the Iron Man Tourney. 8/10

#6-Roddy Piper vs. Greg Valentine, Dog Collar Match, '83: This was in one word, brutal, in another bloody, but it was good. Both men are linked together by a chain fastened to each others collars and the violence ensues. Piper got his ear drum busted open during this match and both men just beat each other up with the chain, choking and slamming each other with it. Its well worth watching, especially since it was very violent for that day. Piper ends up winning this by wrapping the chain around Valentine's legs to pin him to the mat. 9/10.

#5-Road Warriors vs. The Midnight Express, Scaffold Match, '86: Better than the other scaffold match on this countdown, but of course its still little more than punching, kicking and not falling off the scaffold to the ring. It was kinda neat seeing two big guys like Hawk and Animal have to keep their balance while getting their spots in. The Road Warriors take this one after knocking both Express members down to the ring. 7/10. The aftermath where Jim Cornette gets chased up to the scaffold and his fall to the ring is something to cringe at.

#4-Sting vs. Hulk Hogan, WCW Championship Match, '97: After nearly a year build-up this was the result, a sluggish, boring and badly paced match. The crowd did go nuts for Sting when he came out, as this was the first time he would wrestle an actual match in about 15 months. As said before this wasn't a very good main event, its like both guys didn't really seem to try, the attempted screwjob finish was botched as the referee was supposed to count fast with Hogan covering Sting and special enforcer Bret Hart was supposed to call the ref on it. Problem is the ref counted normally so Bret looked dumb for taking over and restarting the match. Sting ends up locking on the Scorpion Death Lock and Hogan gives up as Sting wins the WCW title. 4/10.

-#3-Ric Flair vs. Harley Race, Steel Cage Match for the NWA Championship, Special Referee, Gene Kinisky, '83: The crowd popped huge for Flair as this was the match he had been fighting to get for months, another shot at champion Harley Race. Its a pretty bloody encounter, with some good stiff punches and chops and some good wrestling moves from both men as well. One problem with the match is how Kinisky kept getting involved cause he was so old school that is dragged some of the match down. Flair ends up hitting a crossbody from the top rope onto Race and makes the cover to win the NWA title for a second time. 8/10. Nice they included the post match speech by Flair, very moving.

#2-Magnum T.A. vs. Tully Blanchard, Steel Cage/I Quit Match for the United States Heavyweight Championship, '85: Easily one of the most violent cage matches I've ever seen, the hatred these two had for each other in the months leading up to this contest just came to a head inside the steel structure. This is an extremely bloody encounter that has very little wrestling and just a ton of brawling, both men bleed though Tully bleeds the worst of the two. Magnum ends up using a piece of a wooden chair as a spike to cut open Tully more and when asked if he quits he says yes. Winner and new U.S. champion Magnum T.A. Just a fantastic match, 10/10.

#1-Ric Flair vs. Vader, WCW Championship Match with Ric Flair's career on the line, '93: Great, great match here with Flair fighting from underneath and trying to dethrone the big monster Vader, who had an obvious strength advantage and just wore down Ric with stiff punches and big power moves. From the looks of it Vader hit Flair so hard at one point that he chipped a tooth or two. After some intense battling, Ric rolls Vader up out of nowhere and pins him to with the WCW title. 10/10.

This is a great collection of matches, with some obviously better than the other and the documentary while short is pretty insightful.",1312761600,,17843,4.608627204030227

But I was feeling a little nostalgic and purchased some of the collections that took me back to my youth.  Some have been pretty good (WCCW) and some haven't (AWA)...but this was the best by far!

The documentary just reviews the history.  Starcade was the biggest show and launched in the days before PPV.  But it was still a super popular event.  The documentary takes you year by year through the Jim Crocket days.  But then unfortunately it skips over most of the rest of the years.

The matches are what makes this set.  You can find the list on other reviews so I won't repeat them.  The years skip around of the matches because it is a countdown of the 25 best matches from Starcade.

I stopped watching the documentary portion about halfway through, it was like watching an infomercial for a discontinued product. I also really disliked the lack of associated interview footage for the matches -- i'm sure that having 25 matches didn't leave much room for interviews, et al, but Tully Blanchard's match introductions are rather bland and insipid, and i really love the old interviews.

Any Ric Flair fan will enjoy the set and should consider purchasing it solely for Flair's presence. Steamboat's tag matches are excellent. The Road Warriors convinced me of their greatness, not having seen one of their matches in nearly 20 years. I never liked, and time hasn't altered my opinion, Dusty Rhodes. While I'm sure Dusty still has his following, I just can't suspend my disbelief when watching the cellulite ""Man of the Hour."" The '80s were a great time to be a wrestling fan. ""The Essential Starrcade"" illustrates the difference between the in-ring performance of WWF's top stars in the late '80s and early '90s; these are superb wrestling matches.

Personally, I didn't care for the tag team Scaffold Matches, or the Ladder match, but fans who prefer spot matches should like them.

Flair actually makes Lex Luger's work look decent; Flair/Luger from Starrcade 1988 is the best Luger match I have on DVD. Harley Race in the Steel Cage against Flair was brilliant, which I also hadn't seen in over 20 years.

Who could forget the build-up for Starrcade '97 Sting v. Hogan? In spite of the worked-shoot finish, Sting gets some workrate out of the Hulkster, making it my favorite NwO Hogan match (and I'm still a Hogan mark).

""The Essential Starrcade"" offers better matches than ""The Rise & Fall of WCW,"" and I'd enthusiastically recommend ""Starrcade"" over ""Rise & Fall,"" particularly for who followed NWA/early-WCW and might have preferred it to WWF matches of the same era.",1263340800,,1763,5.086505190311419

Fans get to relive the awesome history in this wonderful DVD.

Disc 1
The Documentary- The documentary was very well produced. Much like The Rise and Fall of WCW release (check out my review for that one!) it actually went quite in depth, and gave you a lot of different perspectives of the topics discussed. It was relatively short in terms of time (it was roughly an hour), however, it didn't feel rushed at all. Everything that was needed to be said was said, and it made for a very enjoyable documentary. For those NWA/WCW fans (like me), it focuses more on the early years, and good 'ol days, than the latter years, thankfully. It was really insightful.
The matches on Disc 1:
First, for those of you that are unaware, it is in order of the twenty-five greatest Starrcade matches of all time, as voted by the fans.
My Rating System:
*****- Absolutely perfect match. No flaws- truly phenomenal. (Ex: Ric Flair VS Ricky Steamboat- Clash of the Champions VI)
****- An exceptionally good match. A few flaws here and there that are somewhat apparent. Very strong match. (Ex: Sting VS The Great Muta- Great American Bash 1989)
***- Good match. Definately above average. Nothing truly good, or worth seeing, but far from poor. (Ex: Rick Rude VS The Ultimate Warrior- SummerSlam 1990)
**- Somewhat decent match. Quite a few flaws. Not good by any means, but not really bad, either. Mildly passable. (Ex: Undertaker VS Test- SummerSlam 2002)
*- Very bad match. Hard to watch. (Ex: The BattleBowl from Starrcade 1992)
DUD- I rarely give these. Absolutely atrocious. So bad it's almost compelling, and fascinating. (Ex: Any Junkyaard Dog match)

Here we go:
Disc 1
(25) Match of the Decade 12.19.96
Hollywood Hulk Hogan vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper
A very poor match. To think that this was the main event of their flagship PPV is upsetting. Not atrocious, just very, very bad. *

(24) Ironman Single's Tournament 12.13.89
Sting vs. the Great Muta
Extremely fun match. It's amazing what they did in just under ten minutes. Very good. ****

(23) Unified Tag Team Championship 12.28.92
Barry Windham & Brian Pillman vs. Ricky Steamboat & Shane Douglas
Absolutely amazing. The true stars of the undercard. Simply beautifully worked tag match. These guys understood the psychology to it, and everything. A must see match for fans of tag team matches. ****1/2

(22) WCW Heavyweight Championship 12.27.98
Goldberg vs. Kevin Nash
Terrible. I'm sure you all know the story- Nash booked himself to end Goldberg's streak. Nice guy. *1/2

(21) BattleBowl Match 12.29.91
Not much here to see, then again, what can you expect from a BattleBowl? The concept was poor, and it really dragged on. Not good. *

(20) 2 out of 3 Falls Match for the U.S. Championship 12.27.93
Stunning Steve Austin vs. Dustin Rhodes
Really fun 2/3 Falls match. Two very underrated talents from WCW here. Unpredictable, too. Not a must-see, but certainly enjoyable enough. ***1/4

Disc 2
(19) NWA Tag Team Championship 11.26.87
Road Warriors vs. Tully Blanchard & Arn Anderson
Another truly amazing tag match on this Disc. So much fun. The crowd was absolutely amazing, and both teams put on a show. Definately stole the show from Starrcade 1987. Dissapointing finish, though. ****1/4

(18) 12.29.96
Rey Mysterio vs. Jushin Liger
Extremely fun cruiserweight action here, which at the time, was the best part of ordering a WCW PPV. Really great. Liger has always been something to see. Check out his stuff in New Japan if you haven't seen it- it really is worth it. ****

(17) Scaffold Match 11.26.87
Midnight Express vs. Rock 'n Roll Express
A truly dreadful gimmick match. Both teams did the best they could do with it, though. Sure the suspense was there, but that was just about it. **

(16) NWA World Heavyweight Championship 12.26.88
Lex Luger vs. Ric Flair
Man, Flair could pull an awesome main event out of anyone. Luger was really in his prime, and showed a ton of promise...too bad he never worked hard enough on improving his faults. He could have been something special. My favorite Luger match of all time, next to his match with Steamboat at Bash '89. ****1/4

(15) 12.27.95
Eddie Guerrero vs. Shinjiro Otani
This match stole Starrcade 1995. It was miles ahead of it's time (for North America, that is.) ****1/2

(14) NWA Tag Team Championship 12.26.88
Dusty Rhodes & Sting vs. Road Warriors
Yet another very good tag team bout. Not as good as some of the others, but still worth checking out. ***1/2

(13) King of Cable Tournament Finals 12.28.92
Sting vs. Vader
Man, these guys had tons of chemistry. An awesome encounter. Not my favorite of theirs, but still magnificent. ****

(12) NWA Tag Team Championship 11.24.83
Brisco Brothers vs. Jay Youngblood & Ricky Steamboat
Very fun contest from four true legends in the business. ***3/4

(11) NWA World Heavyweight Championship 11.28.85
Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes
The best match of their saga. Not great, but defiantely good. ***1/2

(10) WCW Cruiserweight Championship 12.28.97
Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko
Not my favorite cruiserweight match from either of these guys, but good nonetheless. ***1/2

Disc 3
(9) Ironman Tag Team Tournament Match 12.13.89
Steiner Brothers vs. Road Warriors
It really went too short. To my knowledge, this is the only one-on-one meeting between these teams. Like everything else from Starrcade 1989, it was too short to be anything truly great. Not bad, though. **3/4

(8) #1 Cruiserweight Title Contendership Ladder Match 12.17.00
3 Count vs. Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias vs. Jung Dragons
Very good match from the dying cruiserweight divsion of WCW circa 2000. Some great future stars here. They stole the show that night. ****1/4

(7) Ironman Singles Tournament Match 12.13.89
Sting vs. Ric Flair
Really great main event. Not as good as you would expect, and not nearly as good as their Clash match, but still good. ***1/2

(6) Dog Collar Steel Chain Match 11.24.83
""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper vs. Greg Valentine
Absolutely bloody, viscous match. So gruesome, and ahead of it's time (like a lot Piper did). If you're a fan of the bloody brawls in this day an age, you'll really get a ton out of this one. ****1/4

(5) Scaffold Match 11.27.86
Road Warriors vs. Midnight Express
Just like the one from 87. The gimmick killed the match. **1/4

(4) WCW Heavyweight Championship 12.28.97
Sting vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan
The most dissapointing match of all time.  There I said it. Not terrible, but far from good. Terrible finish, as well. It would really be a sign of things to come in WCW. *3/4

(3) Steel Cage Match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship 11.22.83
Ric Flair vs. Harley Race
Another great match from the inaugural Starrcade. Very satisfying main event. ***3/4

(2) Steel Cage I Quit Match for the NWA U.S. Championship 11.28.85
Tully Blanchard vs. Magnum T.A.
Just like the Dog Collar match, this was extremely harsh, and brutal. Way ahead of it's time. Magnum was the star of the future; it's a shame what happened to him. ****1/2

(1) WCW Heavyweight Championship 12.27.93
Ric Flair vs. Vader
Absolutely amazing match. Match of the night, year (for North America), and DVD. Great storytelling, psychology, etc. Absolutely awesome encounter. ****3/4

THE ESSENTIAL COLLECTION

I remember thinking when this was released that this has the potential to be the best release from WWE in a long while. It lived up to that kinda but in a way it was a little of a let down, mostly as far as the documentary is concerned. If you have read any of the other reviews you will know what I am saying. The doc is good but it goes by way to fast in fact it would have been awesome if they would have kept the format they were doing but did it for every Starrcade. Other than that this is a brilliant release that all should own, GO buy it now.

1.[MATCH OF THE DECADE]-RODDY PIPER VS HULK HOGAN-this was at the time one of the biggest matches in wrestling history, or at least one of the most hyped rematches in the business. WCW was on their way to losing to the NWO until Roddy Piper returned to put Hogan in his place, glad some one did. This is actually a much better match then people say or better yet fight as they just brawl basically, sure it was not the greatest bout between them but it was entertaining none the less. The story line going into and after this was great, one of my favorite times in WCW. This was a good match but the ending made this bout really, as The Giant came into the ring to choke slam Piper a fan jumped into the ring to help him and caught some kicks and fist to the head from Hogan and the ref even. Kinda reminiscent of the steel cage match they had. 3.8/5

2.[IORN MAN SINGLES TOURNAMENT]-STING VS THE GREAT MUTA-this was a great match between the two and while I think they had even better matches [which is saying something] this one is close to classic in my book. The action goes back and forth the entire match as both go all out with a various display of wrestling abilities. Muta is just magnificent in this match and the flip were he lands on his feet looks great. Still Sting takes this one with a superplex. 4.8/5

3.[UNIFIED TAG TITLE]-BARRY WINDAM & BRIAN PILLMAN VS RICKY STEAMBOAT & SHANE DOUGLAS-absolutely one of the best matches on this set and really it should be in the top ten, wrestling wise this is top notch. The action in this one is excellent and every one performs well and rises above expectations. Douglas is brilliant, Steamboat is outstanding, Windam is great, and Pillman is amazing, they all do a phenomenal job on this one. The action comes at you non stop as both teams go back and forth, still in the end Douglas and Steamboat retain the tag titles in a classic. 5/5

4.[WCW CHAMPIONSHIP]-GOLDBERG VS KEVIN NASH-the big thing about this match is that it was the first time Goldberg was beat by any one. This one seems a lot like the first match on the disc except with a little more wrestling, good match. I have always liked Nash and I never hated Goldberg so this one still seems like a good bout between 2 big guys. The action was as good as it could be between these two and Disco Inferno coming out still makes me laugh. Bam Bam [R.I.P.] and Scott Hall using the cattle prod helps secure a victory and the title for Nash. 4/5

5. BATTLEBOWL 91-this is an early version of the World War 3 event that WCW would latter hold as a usual card, except this one is minus one ring. This like most battle royals is fun but a little hard to follow at times; you must get them to the other ring and throw them over the top rope. There is some good action in this match from the like of Liger and such, and so good action with Sting, Rick Rude, Ricky Steamboat, and Luger. The match gets really good once it becomes one on one between Sting and Lex Luger. Good enough match and battle royal I guess historic. 4/5

6.[2 OUT OF 3-US CHAMPIONSHIP]-DUSTIN RHODES VS STEVE AUSTIN-long before they were Stone Cold and Goldust they were two great athletes going at it in WCW. This is by far one of the better matches from this disc and collection in my opinion it is cool to see this again before their WWF/E runs. These two go at it and show why they both would go on to be famous in another company putting on a great match. Steve Austin wins two straight falls which is rare after putting on a great show; the lights even go out during this match. 4.5/5

DISC 2

1.[NWA TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP]-ROAD WARRIORS VS ARN ANDERSON & TULLY BLANCHARD-this is back when the wrestlers could tell a story while in the ring, great times. I remember when the Horsemen and LOD were feuding man that was a great time in wrestling, I miss those days. This match is great and full of action as the rivals go at it tooth and nail. Road Warriors come with that brute strength and dominate at time but the Horsemen are quick thinkers and crafty in the ring so it is basically even. The Road Warriors get disqualified after throwing their opponents over the top rope, yeah that rule was around. 5/5

2. REY MYSTERIO JR. VS JUSHIN THUNDER LIGER-this is the battle of to revolutionary wrestlers who both changed the sport during their time in the business. I have always been a fan of Liger and I loved Rey during his WCW days, WWE won't let him do as much as he did then. There is a lot of great high flying action in this fight as both these guys stole the show that night and didn't just fly high but also wrestled showing their different styles. This is a great match that ends after Liger hits a Liger bomb on Rey. 5/5

2.[SCAFFOLD MATCH]-ROCK N ROLL EXPRESS VS THE MIDNIGHT EXPRESS-this is pretty good match and with any match like this there is a sense of tension and anxiety just watching people nearly falling off. For two teams up on that thing they put on a good show trying to punish the others. The Rock N Roll Express take this one in a long rivalry that lasted forever almost. This is an entertaining match you should all enjoy. 4/5

3.[NWA CHAMPIONSHIP]-RIC FLAIR VS LEX LUGER-Ric Flair is one of the all time greatest wrestlers ever and while I have never really been a fan of Lex Luger he could at times deliver a good match. This is one of those times but to be honest that is mostly because of Flair, still it is a good match none the less. Luger dominates most of the match taking to Flair at every opportunity but Flair is a master craftsmen. This is a classic match that is full of drama and emotion, the fans were really into this one. Luger had many near falls on Flair and Ric uses a chair on Luger's legs. But even after that Luger tries to make the come back, while Ric tries to hold him back. Flair retains the title and for a Lex Luger match this is a classic. 5/5

4. EDDIE GUERRERO VS SHINJIRO OTANI-this match was from the 95 Starrcade were it was WCW vs Japan in a tournament type of thing. This is a great match between these two great competitors who go at it looking for the win. The match goes back and forth for most of the fight with Eddie looking like he was going to take the win at times. But it wasn't in the cards that night as he losses to a worthy opponent. 5/5

5.[NWA TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP]-DUSTY RHODES & STING VS THE ROAD WARRIORS-excellent match right here possibly one of the best tag matches of all time. The monstrous Road Warriors take on the charismatic team of Dusty Rhodes and Sting, and they lay into them hard. Still Sting displays what made him a star and Dusty shows why he is one of the greatest performers in front of a crowd of all time. After a hard fought battle the Road Warriors get disqualified and keep the belts. 5/5

6. STING VS VADER-back during Vader's run in WCW he was a feared and respected opponent that held the world title, unlike his run in the WWF. These two have always had great matches together and this is no exception. These two tell a great story in the ring and it feels like a real fight as they just want to hurt each other. Sting takes this one after actually catching Vader in mid air and slamming him for the in. 4/5

7.[NWA TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP]-BRISCO BROTHERS VS JAY YOUNGBLOOD, RICKY STEAMBOAT-another classic tag match that was at the time revolutionary in a way as far as contrasts in styles. Both teams went at each other with the Brisco's being more of a pure wrestling team that can brawl and Steamboat and Youngblood more high risk. The risk takers take the titles from the Brisco's in a great match. 5/5

8.[NWA CHAMPIONSHIP]-DUSTY RHODES VS RIC FLAIR-this is a rematch from the previous year and this one is just as good in my books. These two were always great together and both put on a great show here. Dusty uses his strength to use as Ric utilizes his speed and mind games. This is a hard hitting match that seems to be going Ric's way when the Horsemen interfere but Dusty takes the title home. 4.5/5

9.[WCW CRUISERWIEGHT CHAMPIONSHIP]-EDDIE GUERRERO VS DEAN MALENKO-two of my all time favorite wrestlers lock up in this brilliant match, RIP Eddie. I love both these guys and wish Dean would come back but at least I have tapes and DVD's with him. This is an excellent match that shows both wrestlers talents off greatly, a lot of high impact moves. Dean does all he can to beat Eddie but Eddie pulls this one out in a nice way. 4.5/5

DISC 3

1. ROAD WARRIORS VS STEINER BROTHERS-a battle between to legendary teams to see who the best is, LOD or the Steiner's. The Road Warriors always ran threw every team they went against but the Steiner Brothers were one of the few teams that could match them in strength and talent. This is a hard fought battle between both teams that ends with the Steiner's taking the win in a crazy manner. 4.8/5

2.[LADDER MATCH]-3 COUNT VS JAMIE NOBLE & EVAN KARAGIAS VS JUNG DRAGONS-this is with out a doubt one of the greatest matches in Starrcade history bar none, classic in my mind. These three teams go at it like crazy doing all kinds of things to each other in order to get the upper hand. If you like ladder matches and or high flying action then this is the one for you as all involved pull out all stops to deliver one of the most entertaining matches I have ever witnessed. 3 Count takes this but I recommend watching this over and over, excellent match. 5/5

3.[IRON MAN MATCH]-STING VS RIC FLAIR-these two have had some brilliant matches together and as far as I am concerned they never had a bad one. This while not their best match is still a very good one in which Sting wins the tournament and also becomes a Horseman. The action is great though out and the ring psychology between these two is great, one of the better matches on here. 4.8/5

4.[DOG COLLAR MATCH]-GREG VALENTINE VS RODDY PIPER-this one right here is a slugfest that can best be described as purely a fight, nothing more nothing less. To me this is a classic because this is one of the most historic matches in the history of the business not just Starrcade. By the end of this both are bloodied and Piper really got injured if you have seen his documentary, Piper takes the win. 5/5

5.[SCAFFOLD MATCH]-ROAD WARRIORS VS THE MIDNIGHT EXPRESS-these matches never get the credit the deserve because watching these things live will have you on the edge of your seat. Watching these replays it is easy to say that these types of matches are not that great, but they are actually tense. This match was entertaining and had a wonderful ending involving Jim Cornett after the Road Warriors took the victory. In my eyes this is a classic. 5/5

6.[WCW CHAMPIONSHIP]-STING VS HULK HOGAN-to this day I am still mad about this match, they just couldn't let Sting have his night. This was Sting's first match in like a year and had one of the greatest build ups of all time. And then when Sting should have dominated this match [maybe not completely] but over all should have they let Hogan actually look good and unafraid. All of his opponents before this always looked good and Hogan always had all of the NOW run in for him. But here when during all the build up having Hogan running scared of Sting here he looks unafraid, it don't make sense. Add in the fact that the ref forgot the ending and forgot to count fast, so that ruined what should have been one of the biggest moments in WCW history. This was to be Sting's big moment and Bret Hart's debut into WCW, both were wasted. 3/4

7.[STEEL CAGE NWA CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH]-RIC FLAIR VS HARLEY RACE-this is one of the greatest matches in the history of the business right here. These two went at it like only legends can and go between a wrestling match to a brawl and back. Flair gets bloodied and still takes the belt back. It is always cool to see Natch being lifted into the air. Classic. 5/5

8.[STEEL CAGE WCW CHAMPIONSHIP]-MAGNUM TA VS TULLY BLANCHARD-this like the last is another classic steel cage match that pitted to game opponents against each other. This one is more of a fight then an actual match since it is an ""I Quit"" match and also inside a cage. These two beat each other senseless the entire match with both getting bloody and using the mic as a weapon. During the match there is a shot were Tully is beating on TA's head with the mic and it seems like a pedestrian filmed an actual street fight on a corner or something. Classic match that sees TA take the win when Tully says those two little words. 5/5

9.[WCW CHAMPIONSHIP]-RIC FLAIR VS VADER-the number one pick for this set is a worthy one indeed as the monster Vader takes on the legend Ric Flair. This is a battle right here that sees many twists and turns as Vader dominates a lot of the match over powering the weaker opponent. But the real thing to see here is Ric actually goes to the top rope multiple times and actually jumps off, not thrown off [unreal right]. Still Nach is Nach in this one and over comes the monster, love the ending. 5/5

This is a wonderful set that every wrestling fan should own and if the sales are good enough I really think that the WWE will release the full Starrcade Anthology DVD collection. This is a wonderful set as I said above buy it if you have yet to, GO now.",1236643200,,13836,4.33745651333591
3623520,4,B001H5X6SK,"If you are a of 80's style wrestling than this DVD is for you.  Unfortunately, when the NWA/WCW were relevant their home video releases were very lackluster and this makes up for it.  You finally get to see NWA stars like Muta, Vader, Sting, and Magnum T.A. with a little WWE level production behind them.  The only disappointing thing to me was the length of the documentary feature.  I would have liked a little more discussion on all of the years instead of picking and choosing a few topics.  Definetly worth a look.",1234656000,,520,4.548387096774194

What WrestleMania is to WWE or how Bound For Glory is to TNA in this current era of wrestling, that's what Starrcade was to the NWA/WCW. This was their biggest show of the year like ""Super Bowl"" is to football or ""World Series"" to baseball. Around 25 years later, WWE did the right thing in celebrating the legacy this event has left with this essential collection.

The documentary stars by covering the idea behind the idea & setup of the Starrcade event with Thanksgiving Day being the top drawing wrestling to day of the year along with the importance of having the event in Greensbrough, NC. Brief history behind the Dog Collar match between Roddy Piper & Greg Valentine along with the main event between Ric Flair & Harley Race were covered before going into how successful the event was to the point where they made a heavy amount of money off the pre-sale for the 1984 event. The concept behind Starrcade '85 being held at different arenas (a concept WWE copied for WrestleMania 2 months later) was talked about before heavily discussion the role of Magnum T.A. in Starrcade's history from the violent ""I Quit"" match with Tully Blanchard to how he effected the 1986 edition. The records that Starrcade '86 set along with stories from the Scaffold Match with Road Warriors/Midnight Express were discussed as well. The story behind the setup of Starrcade '87, what effect Vince McMahon had on the event, and how it played a part in the future of Jim Crockett Promotions was heavily discussed. The formation of WCW & the changes to the event such as new concepts along with Eric Bischoff's influence of Starrcade was heavily talked about before the documentary closed out on various views regarding Goldberg's streak ending at the '98 event, why Starrcade lost it's special appeal over the years, and the legacy it left behind. Along with this documentary comes two hidden extras in Flair showing his name written on the Wall Of Fame and a Dusty Rhodes promo for Starrcade '83.

The Top 25 Matches In Starrcade History Include:
1996: Roddy Piper vs. Hollywood Hogan - Hogan attempted to intimidate Piper early to get a series of punches as Hogan kept going to the outside to keep breaking Piper's momentum while resorting to tactics such as eye & body rakes to attempt to gain an advantage as Piper kept coming after Hogan heavily working over his head with a headlock & never letting go along with even using Hogan's same tactics against him as far as using whatever he could to beat on him as both men brawled throughout the contest from inside the ring to outside into the front row.
[Born To Controversy: The Roddy Piper Story]

1989: Sting vs. The Great Muta - This was the second round of the Iron Man tournament with both men losing their first round matches & having no points coming into this match.  Muta started off using his diverse style with his speed in various kicks & snap elbow drop and grounded offense such as a double underhook bridge submission while attempted to use his superior power with press slams while also using the same strategy as Muta as far as attempting a grounded submission & agility as well.

1992: WCW Tag Team Champions Ricky Steamboat & Shane Douglas vs. Barry Windham & Brian Pillman - Steamboat & Douglas were out for revenge based off Barry Windham's attack on them backstage at the previous Clash Of The Champions and showcased that early as they went after Windham when he wasn't the legal man while using more brawling tactics such as punches & even slamming Windham on the outside floor & rampway resulting in Pillman & Windham fighting fire with fire using chokes along with having the illegal man attacking on the floor as both teams traded momentum & had no problems using anything around them on the outside as a weapon as the commentators pretty much told the story of this match with one statement, ""They're not out to beat Barry, they're out to hurt him!""

1998: No Disqualification Match: WCW Champion Goldberg vs. Kevin Nash - Goldberg's streak was at 173-0 going into this match with both men taking & countering each others offense causing them to go outside of their comfort zones like going for submissions with Goldberg's anklelock & Nash's cross armbreaker before the hits got more impactful like a punch that knocked Nash down, Nash powering Goldberg down with a clothesline, Goldberg with a spinning neckbreaker & later spinning dropkick along with a snap slam, and even Nash using the low blow. For two guys who have been know to be very limited in the ring, they gave a good ""big man"" power match with the only negative being the chaotic ending...which is typical of the nWo.
[nWo: Back In Black; nWo: The Revolution; Goldberg: The Ultimate Collection]

1991: BattleBowl Battle Royal - For those who never saw the BattleBowl concept, the winners of the previous ""Lethal Lottery"" tag team matches that were determined by random drawing face off in a two ring battle royal where the last participant in each ring would then face each other & the last man standing wins BattleBowl.  This match had various highlights such as fighting now only inside the rings but also on the floor & on the ramp, the showdowns between some individuals like Luger & Vader along with Sting & Rude, when it came down to the final four in ring two, and the final two having a ""match"" inside the match.

1993: 2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: United States Champion Dustin Rhodes vs. Steve Austin - Dustin was in control taking down & grounding Austin causing Austin to keep going to the outside to attempt to break the momentum before Dustin followed him to the outside & brawled with one man getting tossed me into the third row & getting busted open as both men traded momentum throughout the match...and a power outage.  The match itself wasn't the strongest one they've had because the match stipulation actually hurt the match here more than helped it.

1987: NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Road Warriors - The Warriors started off dominate showcasing their strength with various power moves such as bearhugs & press slams while staying one step ahead of the Horsemen as their offense was just having no effect causing them to retreat to the outside various times to break momentum before finally catching a break singling out a body part working on it both in & outside of the ring while also bending the rules to their advantage.  This was a good tag match between two teams with different styles who were able to mesh together.
The alternative commentary with Road Warrior Animal & Todd Grisham talked about various subjects such as his relationship with Hawk & Paul Ellering, the fans back then compared to today, working the heavy schedule, the art of tag team wrestling, and if he considers them the greatest tag team of all time.
[Road Warriors]

1996: Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Jushin Liger - Liger took control early with strong offense from a headbutt & stiff powerbomb on more than one occasion to a suplex over the top to the floor while working over the back with holds & submissions before Rey was able to rebound with some impactful offense of his own including DDT & camel clutch as both men traded momentum delivering one impactful move after another such as both delivering release german suplexes & going aerial at various times.  This was a crusierweight dream match between two international stars that lived up to the hype.
[Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man]

1987: Scaffold Match: Rock `N Roll Express vs. Midnight Express - Cornette tried to use his numbers advantage early by having Big Bubba get involved in the ring while the Midnight Express double teamed the other member on the scaffold before they even the odds as both teams battled on the scaffold using whatever objects they could get their hands on or brought up themselves resulting in someone bleeding.  Scaffold matches are very limited in what they can do so both teams made the best of it & went beyond just waiting for someone to fall.

1988: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger - This was Luger's last chance at Flair for the championship with the special stipulation that Flair could lose the title via disqualification.  Flair attempted to play mind games early only for Luger to respond with his power dominating Flair from various slams to heavily working over Flair's arm while begging for more whenever Flair would chop him to no effect & taking a pages out of Flair's own playbook using the environment on the outside to his advantage as well as Flair's own signature offense being used again him before Flair was able to take advantage of mistiming by Luger to heavily work over his leg to the point where Luger was showing effects whenever he attempted to execute his power offense with J.J. Dillion on the outside making his presence felt when necessary.
[Legends Of Wrestling: Ric Flair & Sgt. Slaughter]

1995: Eddie Guerrero vs. Shinjiro Ootani - Both men were mat wrestling early with both men being so evenly matches that neither man was able to have an advantage for every long as both men executed similar offense against each other such as moves from a springboard position & a powerbomb as Eddie was able to hit him with some lucha libre such as a various head scissors takedown along with some impactful moves such as a spike powerbomb & brain buster to the point where his opponent was bleeding from the nose & lips while Ootani executed his own impactul offense such as a german suplex & one dropkick directly to the back of Eddie's head as this was a very impactful & intense match from start to finish.
[Viva La Raza: The Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero]

1988: NWA Tag Team Champions Road Warriors vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sting - The Road Warriors had recently turned against their Six Man Tag Team Championship partner Dusty setting up this match here with Sting & Dusty taking control heavily working over the arm with twisting wristlocks while the Warriors attempted to singled out one member striking him down & working over with power moves only for Sting & Dusty to give it all right back & beating the Warriors at their own game using their own tactics before the Warriors focused on Dusty's injured eye with all the action eventually breaking down into a four way brawl. This was a fun match.
[American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story; Greatest WCW's PPV Matches Vol. 1]

1992: Sting vs. Big Van Vader - This was the finals of the King Of Cable tournament along with their PPV rematch from Great American Bash earlier in the year while it should also be noted that this was both men's second of three matches due to their participation in the BattleBowl/Lethal Lottery concept this night.  Vader started off very dominate easily easily tossing Sting down & around many times including spearing him onto the top rope twice before Sting was able to recover taking Vader off his feet using his feet & strength including coming off onto both Vader & Race at one point on the outside as they continued to trade momentum with Vader literally punching the paint off Sting's face while Sting brought a diverse assault that had Vader bleeding from the mouth as both men were able to have counters to each other's offense including one man attempting to use ""rope a dope"" in absorbing one man's offense until he was tired out to take advantage as this literally came down to one man finally being able to catch the other using their own momentum against them for the win.

1983: NWA Tag Team Champions Brisco Brothers vs. Jay Youngblood & Ricky Steamboat - Steamboat & Youngblood took the early advantage keeping a fast paced using various chops & frequent tags to keep a fresh man in while heavily singling out one of their opponents working over their arm while the Briscos heavily relied on double team tactics along with their amateur wrestling background to keep both men on the mat with various stretches & submissions while also testing the limits of what special referee Angelo Moscow would allow in the match as this was a classic tag team wrestling match where it took one team using their opponents strategy against them to come out as the champions.
[Most Powerful Families In Wrestling; Ricky Steamboat: Life Story Of A Dragon]

1985: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes - Dusty came into this match with a special wrestling boot on his foot due to Flair & the Andersons breaking his ankle months earlier with Dusty showing up Flair in the beginning through either stealing his strut or staying one step ahead in the ring including giving Flair a receipt for that injury by hurting Flair's leg & foot by any means necessary while Flair relied on his signature offensive maneuvers including working over Dusty's leg as this was one of their best counters as it was competitive from start to finish.
[Ultimate Ric Flair Collection]

1996: WCW Crusierweight Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko - Both men started out trading fist with Malenko showcasing some aggression with power moves & tactics like stomping on Eddie's hands & going after his face through either kicks or dropping Eddie directly on it while Eddie was able to target a body part being relentless working on it using whatever possible at around ringside to punish it even more including a sandwich between the ring post & steps to an aerial assault directly on that injured area of the body in what was a physical encounter between the two.
[Viva La Raza: The Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero]

1989: Road Warriors vs. Steiner Brothers - This was the second round of the Iron Team tournament that year along with the first ever meeting between both teams with both teams every evenly matched in regards to their power with one man's clothesline turning his opponent inside out only for the opponent's partner to deliver one of their own that took his partner down as both teams were very stiff against each other & acknowledged it with some of the looks they gave each other before one team was finally gave to gain & retain the advantage singling out to back attempting to take away the power advantage from the other team in a match between two evenly matched teams that definitely hard hitting.

2000: Ladder Match: 3 Count vs. Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias vs. Jung Dragons - Shannon Moore & Shane Helms vs. Jamie Noble & Evan Karagis vs. Kaz Hayashi & Jimmy Yang - It was during this period in WCW that the crusierweight division had the most focus on it than it has in over a year with all six of these men stealing the show every chance they had but this match was different in that although it's setup as a three team ladder match, the one person who grabs the contract at the top would receive the title match against Crusierweight Champion Chavo Guerrero who also joined in on commentary for this match. This match had it's moments full of crazy spots & moments like Yang dropkicking the ladder into Noble & Evan followed by Kaz doing a moonsault onto the ladder with both underneath, a botched backdrop on Kaz that caused him to land on his head instead of the ladder, back to back to back various dives from the ring to the outside with Noble being shoved off the ladder onto everyone on the outside, another ladder being brought into the match to be made a scaffold where Evan caught Kaz & powerslammed him off of it, Shane Helms with the ""world's highest neckbreaker"", and Shannon Moore's head scissors taking Yang off the scaffold to the floor. If you only know these guys from their runs in WWE then you don't know what your missing as this match was the match of the night at that PPV as it was the crusierweight division that was saving the WCW product at that time. It wasn't as crazy as the T.L.C. matches in WWE but these guys put on one hell of a performance in what many consider the last quality Starrcade match in the history of the event.
[The Ladder Match; WCW's Greatest PPV Matches Vol. 1]

1989: Sting vs. Ric Flair - This was the final match in the Iron Man tournament where Sting had to win by pinfall/submission to win the tournament while Flair had the options of pinfall/submission or count out to win the tournament as both men played mind games with each other taunting the crowd & each other before Sting was able to get the advantage staying one step ahead of Flair constantly countering & reversing Flair's offense causing Flair to keep going to the outside to break Sting's momentum before finally being able to get the advantage himself taking the match both in & outside of the ring getting more aggressive with his trademark offense only for Sting to get more intense as well with both men going back & forth with their series of reversals & counters against each other resulting in one of their top matches throughout their entire rivaly.

1983: Dog Collar Match: Roddy Piper vs. Greg Valentine - It should be noted that this was a non-United States Championship match as both men had an early tug-of-war with the chain connecting the dog collars before one man was able to use it to their advantage making their punches & eye rakes along with a low blow more impactful than normal only for his opponent to come back in a more violent fashion not only wrapping the chain around his eyes but also beating on his ear as both men used the chain not only as a weapon but to gain leverage & momentum in their favor until both men were bleeding from different parts of their body making this a match that was ""hardcore"" or ""extreme"" for it's time with an aftermath that was just as violent as the match.
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 80's; Born To Controversy: The Roddy Piper Story]

1986: Scaffold Match: Road Warriors vs. Midnight Express - It wasn't known at the time but Hawk came into this match with a cracked bone in his lower leg while the scaffold itself wasn't put together as safely as possible as you saw pieces of the railing coming part when the teams were climbing up the cage.  With the action happened on top of a scaffold where it very limited in space, the action was reduced to nothing more than brawling & power strikes with powder being used as a weapon while both teams where also fighting on the bottom of the scaffold hanging off it like monkey bars & even one man swinging off this opponents legs at one point but what was more memorable about this match was the aftermath when one man took the fall off the scaffold that still effects the victim to this day.
The alternative commentary with Road Warrior Animal & Todd Grisham talked about various subjects such as how scared he was up there, how Hawk was wrestling with a broken leg, how dangerous this match was, and how the Road Warriors were always ""test subjects"" these type of dangerous matches.
[Road Warriors]

1997: WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Sting - Over a year in the making here as with Sting's first match (on television) since Fall Brawl the year before with Hogan coming out of the box beating on Sting with punches with Sting responding with dropkicks sending Hogan to the outside before Hogan knocked Sting down & Sting getting right back up after Hogan decided to show off. The match got taken to the outside with Hogan using Sting's own trademark bat against him while also using the ring post & guardrail before taking the match back into the ring where he was dominate to the point where it looked like he won the match at one point before another figure from Hogan's past appeared to make sure nobody got ""screwed."" This match will go down as one of the most disappointing main events in history because the in-ring action itself never seemed to leave past first gear (which they made up for in later matches) with the finish itself not being what the people wanted & the fact that it was botched too didn't help matters. The match wasn't bad but it didn't live up to the hype.
[Hulk Hogan: Ultimate Anthology; The Best Of Sting]

1983: Steel Cage Match: NWA Champion Harley Race vs. Ric Flair - The first main event of the very first Starrcade with Gene Kiniski as the special referee Flair starting out in control keeping Race on the ground while avoiding any attempt at offense by Race before he was able to regain control working over the previously injured neck relentlessly with various strikes directly on the neck followed by impactful moves such as a neckbreaker & piledriver as they traded momentum using the same strategy against each other such as using the cage itself as a weapon until his opponent was bleeding focusing on the cut & head area along with taking advantage of the referee when possible to the point where he had to get physically involved when possible to make sure the rules were maintained in what was an aggressive match between both men for it's time.
[Ultimate Ric Flair Collection]

1985: Steel Cage/I Quit Match: United States Champion Tully Blanchard vs. Magnum T.A. - Both men started brawling with each other right away trading fist with both men sending the other into the cage multiple times causing them to bleed only for each other to continue to relentlessly focus on the cut either ripping or biting at it as both men continued to use whatever they could get their hands on to punish each other including the microphone or a wooden chair to the point where anyone else who got in their way would pay for it as this match has gone down as one of the greatest ""I Quit"" matches of all time to the point where it's the standard of what's expected from this type of match as it was exactly what you expected...a violent, physical, bloody war.
[Bloodbath: Wrestling's Most Dangerous Steel Cage Matches]

1993: WCW Champion Vader vs. Ric Flair - This match was titled ""Title vs. Career"" as Flair had to win the WCW Championship or else he would lose his career with an additional note for those trivia fans in that Vader's manager was the same man Flair defeated for a World Championship at the first Starrcade in Harley Race.  Vader showcased his power advantage early easily powering & shoving Flair down with Flair's chops having no effect as Vader continued to just pound him down including briefly taking the match to the outside where both men took advantage of the outside environment including Race getting involved as Vader continued to deliver big blows to the point where Flair was bleeding from the mouth before it took a mistake by Vader for Flair to start gaining momentum delivering big moves multiple times in an attempt to take him off his feet along with chopping him down by focusing on the legs along with resorting to tactics that's earned him the nickname ""The Dirtiest Player In The Game"" as this was a competitive match that has gone down as one of the greatest & most emotional in the history of this event.

Like I said earlier, this is a great collection of memories & matches from the different eras of wrestling.  The two matches I do wish would have been voted on here was the Flair vs. Luger vs. Sting with the winner facing WCW Champion Randy Savage in 1995 and Steamboat vs. Blanchard from 1984.  In the end, this is one release that pays justice to the promotion of NWA/WCW (which WWE usually doesn't like to do) so I would recommend this.",1234569600,8,23143,4.651663405088063

Starrcade December 27, 1993 - WCW World Heavyweight Championship - Ric Flair's Career Is On the Line
Ric Flair vs. Vader

so for all the NWA/WCW fan this is a great dvd set of matches, the matches are hosted by good old Mene Gene. They barely talk about the later PPVs and I believe they skip some of the earlier ones as well in the documentary.",1234483200,,3197,4.883116883116883
3623523,5,B001H5X6SK,"This 3-Disc set brings us 25 of the greatest matches from the premiere event in the National Wrestling Alliance (later World Championship Wrestling). It starts off with a documentary on the history of the event, with some of the participants in the event, such as Nature Boy Ric Flair, Tully Blanchard, Arn Anderson, The American Dream Dusty Rhodes, David Crockett, Jim Cornette, Road Warrior Animal and others. The matches feature Superstars such as Flair, Harley Race, Big Van Vader, Sting, Greg ""The Hammer Valentine vs. ""Rowdy' Roddy Piper in a brutal Dog Collar Match, Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Magnum T.A., Rhodes, Stunning Steve Austin, The Great Muta, Bill Goldberg, Kevin Nash, The Total Package Lex Luger, The Road Warriors, The Midnight Express, The Rock 'N Roll Express, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, Rey Mysterio, Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger, Barry Windham, Shane Douglas, Brian Pillman and more. Championship matches, I Quit contests and scaffold wars are also featured in this set, and the top 25 are some of the best to be picked. I would give this 5 out of 5 stars. Get this one!!!",1234310400,,1119,5.054054054054054
3623524,5,B001H5X6SK,"If you like old school wrestling, this is a dvd must. WWE took the video footage it owned to make a best of Starrcade, and it is very enjoyable. The documentary, while good, is a bit short. It is less then an hour long, which upset me, as I was looking for a solid documentary on it. I know it is hard to do a documentary on a single event, despite being around for so long, but I think it could have been done differently.

However, the matches more then made up for it. I loved the top 25 countdown they did. 25 solid matches were put on this dvd, and only one of them have appeared on another WWE dvd, which is a nice change of pace from the double dip format the WWE uses when making tons of their dvds. Watching guys like Flair, Sting, Vader, Four Horsemen, Road Warriors, Rhodes, and countless others was a treat for an old school fan who is studying professional wrestling. While the younger generation of fans won't understand the stories behind the matches, and the guys themselves, it is a treat to watch, and a must have dvd for any wrestling fans dvd collection.",1233619200,,1074,4.29064039408867
3623525,5,B001H5X6SK,"This is an awesome set for any fan of true pro wrestling. This is not the sports entertainment that we see in the WWE today and on occasion in TNA. This is real pro wrestling, the way it ought to be. The wrestling matches in this set blow away almost anything the WWE/WWF/WWWF has ever done. Very few WWE superstars could put on these types of matches and when they do, there is usually only 1 or 2 great matches per PPV. The 1980's Starrcades would be top notch from the beginning to the end and the match selection here shows that. Even in the 1990's, there was still more pure wrestling on Starrcade than WWE has ever had. I highly recommend this set if you were a fan of the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions or WCW. WWE does not seem to want to put out entire WCW/NWA PPV's that they have the rights to, so sets like these are the best we will probably get.

For you younger fans, if you want to see Sting at his best, buy this set. The Sting you see in TNA is great but the Sting in these matches was at his best ever. And who could pass up classic matches with Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Roddy Piper or Harley Race?!?!? This set is simply awesome!!!",1233360000,,1150,4.15695067264574
3623526,4,B001H5X6SK,"Its about time Vince put together a dvd set for just nwa/wcw. There is not much left to say that others have already talked about in reviews. The only prob. I have with the set is the main doc. I find it to be kind of short and it skiped around alittle, all the matches are great.",1231977600,,280,3.9298245614035086
3623527,5,B001H5X6SK,"Starrcade, the event that led to the birth of many ppv's that people has ever witnessed including Wrestlemania. This is a great release & it was good to see WWE pay repects to NWA/WCW's grandness stage of all time. This 3 disc set holds 25 matches from Starrcade's past along with a short documentary on the event's heritage. All of the matches are in their entirety but entrances for the most part are not. Although there are a few entraces that are still intact. Including Sting's from '97 & a couple a Flair's. But don't expect any entrances from the likes of Goldberg, Kevin Nash, and Hollywood Hogan. Nevertheless, still a near perfect set.

Even though the documentary portion is pretty short (about 10 minutes shy of a hour) it covers enough to let people know how special & historic Starrcade came to be. You will hear from superstars who were actually a part of Starrcade. Including Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Arn Anderson, Magnum T.A., Tully Blanchard, Road Warrior Animal, Brisco Brothers, Roddy Piper, & others. The documentary goes straight forward & doesn't stop for a match. The superstars speak on matters dealing with Starrcade. Such as the event's birth, growth, popularity, issues, & different angles surrounding Starrcade. Oh and to note out, there are no special bonus extra's on this set whatsoever. Just a brief documentary and 25 matches picked by the fans is all you get.

Just to clear up some confusion, the order of the match selection is how the fans voted for them. I hope that helps you.

Disc 1
(25) Match of the Decade 12.19.96
Hollywood Hulk Hogan vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper
Me personally, I think WCW really hyped up this match way too much. Hogan just formed the nWo & Piper was the one who everybody expected to stop them. Nothing we haven't already seen from these. Just a good brawl. Nothing special. 3.5/5

(24) Ironman Single's Tournament 12.13.89
Sting vs. the Great Muta
Very good match. Some nice chain wrestling. Good offense by both men. A very solid match. 4.5/5

(23) Unified Tag Team Championship 12.28.92
Barry Windham & Brian Pillman vs. Ricky Steamboat & Shane Douglas
Awesome tag bout. Windham looked very good. One of the bests tag team matches I've ever seen. 5/5

(22) WCW Heavyweight Championship 12.27.98
Goldberg vs. Kevin Nash
I fully agree with what Arn Anderson said about Goldberg's streak. It went on for way too long & this defeat really hurt Goldberg. A little bit of a good big man match. Didn't really care for the ending though. 3.75/5

(21) BattleBowl Match 12.29.91
I really enjoyed this match. Vader & Steamboat had a nice brawl on the outside. But it did however dragged on for little bit too long. Steve Austin & Sting has a good showing. The final two put on a very good one on one match. 4/5

(20) 2 out of 3 Falls Match for the U.S. Championship 12.27.93
Stunning Steve Austin vs. Dustin Rhodes
This is a match in my book that gets better the more times you watch it. I thought this was a very good match. Pretty good offense by Rhodes in this one. 4.5/5

Disc 2
(19) NWA Tag Team Championship 11.26.87
Road Warriors vs. Tully Blanchard & Arn Anderson
Very good tag match. The Road Warriors just dominates Arn & Tully with their freakish strength. Solid tag match but with a BS ending. 4.5/5

(18) 12.29.96
Rey Mysterio vs. Jushin Liger
Even though Piper & Hogan was the main event, these two great cruiserweights stole the show. Great cruiserweight action with some good wrestling. Awesome match. 4.75/5 [Also available on Rey Mysterio: The Biggest Little Man]

(17) Scaffold Match 11.26.87
Midnight Express vs. Rock 'n Roll Express
Not a big fan of these matches. The suspense is there but nothing in my eyes that caught my attention. 3.5/5

(16) NWA World Heavyweight Championship 12.26.88
Lex Luger vs. Ric Flair
Good match. Much better then I expected it to be. Some very good wrestling from both men. Good powerhouse moves by Luger. 4.5/5

(15) 12.27.95
Eddie Guerrero vs. Shinjiro Otani
Starrcade '95 like few other Starrcades were hosting a joint production of the New Japan vs. WCW. Great aerial moves by both Eddie & Otani. Great back and forth competition. Just a terrific match. 4.75/5 [Also available on The Legacy of Eddie Guerrero]

(14) NWA Tag Team Championship 12.26.88
Dusty Rhodes & Sting vs. Road Warriors
Another good tag bout. A good back and forth match up between the two teams. All four looked really good in the ring. Great match. I really enjoyed this one a lot. 5/5

(13) King of Cable Tournament Finals 12.28.92
Sting vs. Vader
I have always thought that Sting & Big Van Vader made an awesome pairing and this match was no exception. Sting takes some hard blows by Vader in this one. I thought the ending fitted in very well. I liked it. Very good big man vs. smaller man contest. 4.5/5

(12) NWA Tag Team Championship 11.24.83
Brisco Brothers vs. Jay Youngblood & Ricky Steamboat
Good offensive exchanges by both teams. A very good all around contest. 4.25/5

(11) NWA World Heavyweight Championship 11.28.85
Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes
Great match. One of the bests in not only Flair's career but in Dusty's as well. Dusty works on the leg of Flair's for quite some time. The Horsemen would interfere. But still a tremendous match. 5/5 [Also available on Ric Flair: The Ultimate Collection]

(10) WCW Cruiserweight Championship 12.28.97
Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko
Malenko and Eddie has had way better matches then this. But a pretty good match nevertheless though. 4.25/5 [Also available on The Legacy of Eddie Guerrero]

Disc 3
(9) Ironman Tag Team Tournament Match 12.13.89
Steiner Brothers vs. Road Warriors
A very good first one on one meeting from these two legendary teams. But I kind of expected a little bit more. Still a good match but the ending is what made the match. 4/5

(8) #1 Cruiserweight Title Contendership Ladder Match 12.17.00
3 Count vs. Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias vs. Jung Dragons
One of the best ladder matches I have ever seen. This was totally a complete different ladder match then what we have seen from Edge & Christian, Hardys, & Dudleys earlier in the year in the then WWF. The three teams did some crazy things with those ladders. A great match. 5/5 [Also available on The Ladder Match]

(7) Ironman Singles Tournament Match 12.13.89
Sting vs. Ric Flair
Another great battle from Sting & Flair. Especially with this being Flair's & Sting's second match of the night. Some good offensive exchanges. And the time limit really played a significant role in the match which added more. A very good end to the match. Terrific match. 5/5

(6) Dog Collar Steel Chain Match 11.24.83
""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper vs. Greg Valentine
Just a straight up fight. The chain came into play many, many times. A very bloody bout. 4.25/5

(5) Scaffold Match 11.27.86
Road Warriors vs. Midnight Express
Once again this kind of match didn't catch my attention but a better match then the other from disc 2. The ending is defiantely something to see. 4/5

(4) WCW Heavyweight Championship 12.28.97
Sting vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan
I have no idea why this match was voted in. The match didn't suck persay but the BS ending really didn't cut it for me. It really hurt the match more then what it was already. And that was bad! 2.5/5

(3) Steel Cage Match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship 11.22.83
Ric Flair vs. Harley Race
This is the match that Flair regained his World Heavyweight title. Race & Flair used the cage pretty good. Both gets bloody. Possibably their best match against one another in their careers. A classic match all the way. 5/5 [Also available on Ric Flair: The Ultimate Collection]

(2) Steel Cage I Quit Match for the NWA U.S. Championship 11.28.85
Tully Blanchard vs. Magnum T.A.
This was a harsh and brutal match to watch. The cage came into play many times. Both men were just doing anything & everything to one another. Brutal & bloody match with a brutal & bloody end. 5/5 [Also available on Bloodbath: The Most Incredible Steel Cage Matches]

(1) WCW Heavyweight Championship 12.27.93
Ric Flair vs. Vader
Vader was just dominate & whelling on Flair. While Flair was throwing out his rule book and pulling off moves you rarely see from Flair. Defiantley a match for the ages. One of the bests in WCW & classic as well. 5/5

Overall I was very pleased with this release. WWE did a good job and so did the fans. Props to WWE for releasing this set. I highly recommend getting this in the near future.",1231977600,41,8440,4.707598371777476
3623528,5,B001H5X6SK,"Boy I have got to see this!  I can't rate this as of yet since I haven't gotten the dvd but when I do, then I'll tell you what I think and rate it by then.",1231977600,,155,3.3055555555555554
3623529,5,B001H5X6SK,"Eight years ago, when WWE purchased the tape libraries of both ECW and NWA/WCW I had numerous DVD projects I wanted them to release from those archives and a Starrcade collection was near the top of that list. I didn't think it would take this long for WWE to release a Starrcade collection, but it's here now and it's easily the best DVD release WWE will have all year. I won't list the matches, most everyone else has done that, instead I'll focus on the production, packaging, etc..

First, a box set of all the Starrcade events would've been better, but considering WWE's feelings toward NWA/WCW I think we're lucky to have the 25 matches included on this set. The matches were voted upon by visitors to WWE's site several months back. This voting is both good and bad. It's good because we get to democratically choose the matches included on these DVD sets, but it's bad because we must choose from a list of matches pre-selected by WWE. With that said, it's tough to argue with the 25 matches selected for this release. I only notice a few glaring omissions, most notably Flair vs. Randy Savage from Starrcade '95 as well as Flair vs. Nikita Koloff from Starrcade '86. If the dud Hogan matches had been left off this release, then these other matches probably could've been included.
This release also contains the DVD debut of the classic match between Flair and Big Van Vader from Starrcade '93. This match alone is worth the price of this set, without a doubt. We also get classic matches like: Flair vs. Sting (SC '89), Sting vs. Vader (SC '92), Flair vs. Luger (SC '88) and the classic Brisco Brothers vs Youngblood/Steamboat tag title match (SC '83). In other words, this set is a virtual encyclopedia of classic wrestling matches from NWA/WCW.

The DVD opens with a documentary on the history of the event. As with all WWE documentaries, the truth can be difficult to find, but I was surprised that WWE actually admitted to creating the Survivor Series in order to squeeze cable companies into dropping the Starrcade PPV event. But there are many inconsistencies too. For example, Dusty Rhodes talks about the mistake to bring Japanese wrestlers in to compete at Starrcade, and how when Eric Bischoff took over, he put Starrcade back on track by eliminating such nonsense. Well, there is one problem with that, Eric invited New Japan Pro Wrestling to come into Starrcade '95 and compete in a world cup of wrestling. Plus, and no offense to Magnum, but the line by Dusty that Magnum T.A. was being presented with offers from Hollywood to star in movies made me laugh out loud!
The doc is short and sweet and sticks to only the greatest moments, which is fine because I bought this for the matches, not for a documentary.

As for the rest of the DVD, it does come in a nice digipak and NOT the cheap paper slip packaging used for Kane's DVD and the Summer Slam collection. Also, Jesse Ventura's commentary is intact on the matches he calls and has not been removed like in select previous DVDs!

Overall, this set is a wrestling fans dream come true. If you were a longtime NWA/WCW fan, than this set will bring back a lot of memories. If not, then be prepared to see some of the best matches ever from wrestling's first mega-event!",1231804800,4,3244,4.616984402079723

8307978,4,B001H5X6SK,"As I sat watching The Best of Starrcade DVD, I thought to myself What could I say that would be different than a simple match listing or talking about my favorite matches? It was during this process that I realized that I am a lapsed professional wrestling fan whose prime viewing years were probably 1998-2003, which meant that I never saw 92% of the content on this DVD. Complicating matters further, I primarily watched the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) instead of WCW.

Therefore, it might be hard for a current fan of the WWE Universe type of matches or my preferred era (1980s and 1990s World Wrestling Federation) to appreciate the contents of this DVD. Minus the overdone Goldberg-Kevin Nash match and maybe the three way ladder match, the matches are more technical and its more about the wrestling, rather than these big cartoonish characters that populated the WWF/E. Its a jarring transition at first, but I grew to really like it, despite it being alien to me.

If you were a longtime NWA/WCW fan this is a must grab. For newer fans, it could be either really good or bad depending on your taste.",1461110400,2,1116,4.688775510204081
