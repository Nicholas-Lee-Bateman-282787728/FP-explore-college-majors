7956896,4,B00005YCWL,"WWII Battlefront - the Atlantic campaign highlights the Eastern front of WWII.  The 10 episodes are Dunkirk, The Battle of Norway, the Bombing of England, The Battle of Malta, North Africa.  On Disc II there is Monte Cassino, D-Day, Retaking France, Operation Dragoon (the battle through France) and Battle of the Bulge.  The episodes are in color.  Additional features are - Animated menus, Battlefront previews, Military medals slide show, Propaganda Posters, Oringinal newsreels from the war years, Biographical documentaries, and direct sceen access.

This is not the finest video history of WWII, but it does give a good overview and relies on interviews with historians and actual combatants.  It also highlights some episodes, such as the battle between the British and the Germans in Norway in April 1940, that are not covered in depth in other WWII video histories.  Each episode is about 40 minutes long.  I had been looking for a video on the Battle for the Atlantic - the 5 year battle between U-boats and the British &  American Fleets - and had been mislead by the title.  Still, this is not a bad purchase if you enjoy WWII video programs.",1090713600,4,1154,4.932642487046632
