2718262,4,B000M2E340,I did some research and found out that the episodes in this are kinda scooby doo all stars and scooby doo where are you. half the episodes ran as scooby doo where are you and then the rest where included the the scooby doo all star block. and then weren't re aired for over a decade. so there was actualy a scooby doo season 3 but it seems it wasn't totaly aired as season 3.,1169251200,5,375,4.013333333333334
2718263,4,B000M2E340,"The packaging is obviously wrong.  ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?"" only ran for two seasons, 1969 and 1970.  In my opinion, it is by FAR the best Scooby-Doo series and I think it has the best theme song of all the series.  The third season didn't come until 1972 and then it was the hourlong ""New Scooby-Doo Movies.""  ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" came out in 1976 and as part of the ""Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour.""  The 1978 series were the remaining shows from the ""Scooby-Doo Show.""  If anything, this set would contain those lost episodes.  Unfortunately, it's still too early for any information to come out but they should also include the episodes of the ""New Scooby-Doo Movies"" that were not included in the movies set.  Oh well, I'm sure it will be a great set because it is Scooby-Doo and it is still the PS (Pre-Scrappy) era.  So, that's why I'm giving it four stars mainly because I don't know which episodes they are and they don't have the right title but we shall see when the set is released.",1168732800,8,993,4.564971751412429
2718264,5,B000M2E340,The 1978 season is great but why isn't the 1977 season being released? Those 8 episodes were not included in last years Scooby Doo/Dynomutt dvd for some reason and now they seem to be skipping over them.,1168300800,,203,4.513513513513513

Remembered the one where the gang went to visit Velma's cousin in Salem on Halloween & so many others.

This is the original Scooby Doo.
Original voices. Original gang. Original crime solving mystery wrapped up by ""those pesky kids""
This does seem like a 'Best of' but I probably think they all are as long as it's Fred, Velma, Daphne Scooby & Shag.

I've recently made several Hanna Barbera streaming purchases of old faves.
I love revisiting some of my after school favorites & they still translate with the new generation.

2718336,4,B000M2E340,"I loved Scooby as a little girl and now my 4 year old daughter is obsessed with all things Scooby. We own the ""Scooby Doo Where Are You?"" Seasons 1 and 2 set and added this to our Scooby collection a few months ago for variety. Personally, we don't like the Scooby episodes that were made from the 1980s on, we love the classic episodes. I'm sure others have said this, but there was NOT a third season to the original series ""Scooby Doo Where Are You?"" The original series ran in 1969 and 1970 and then came the New Scooby Doo Movies (hour long episodes featuring a plethora of guest stars like Sonny and Cher, Mama Cass, The Globetrotters, etc.) in 1972-74. The episodes in this DVD set were episodes that aired in 1978 and 1979.

The episodes included in this set are on 2 discs (one double sided) and are: 1. Watch Out! The Willawaw 2. A Creepy Tangle in the Bermuda Triangle  3. A Scary Night With a Snow Beast Fright  4. To Switch a Witch  5. The Tar Monster  6. A Highland Fling with a Monstrous Thing  7. The Creepy Case of Old Iron Face  8. Jeepers, It's the Jaguaro!  9. Make a Beeline Away from That Feline  10. The Creepy Creature of Vulture's Claw  11. The Diabolical Disc Demon 12. Scooby's Chinese Fortune Kooky Caper  13. A Menace in Venice  14. Don't Go Near the Fortress of Fear  15. The Warlock of Wimbledon  16. The Beast is Awake in Bottomless Lake. One thing I didn't like was that the double sided disc doesn't have the sides labeled so it's hard to know which side will play using the track listing. These episodes feature the gang traveling around the world to visit friends and family in different countries and of course stumbling upon a mystery to solve.

We love all the episodes and have watched them many times. There are two reasons I'm giving it 4 stars, not because of the episode content, but because of the picture quality and the DVD box condition. When we watch it, we see spots popping up in the scenes and disappearing in nearly all episodes. It needs to be remastered for better picture quality. Lastly, when the DVD box arrived, it looked worn around the edges like it had either been used or was sitting around for a very long time and had a tear in the cardboard. There's also a big sticker on the back of the box that can't be removed covering Scooby's face on the back cover. So we were disappointed with these two things, but otherwise very happy with the episodes and have them on constant replay. Great addition to a Scooby collection!",1477612800,5,2484,4.393013100436681

However, some seem to stray into experimental territory with things like dinosaurs, which my son instantly didn't like.  Also, there was an episode where they didn't even unmask the bad guy at the end, they just got hauled away by the police.  These days, I like my Scooby Doo by the book apparently, but maybe their ratings were dropping at the time and they lost some of their budget/tried new things as an attempt to give the show new life.  The dvd still delivers plenty of episodes despite a few odd ones.  I'd say it's more than a dvd just for completists with it's own solid additions to the previous episodes.",1416182400,,810,4.597222222222222

2718505,3,B000M2E340,"Inspired by such diverse material as radio's ""I Love a Mystery"" and television's ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,"" the cartoon series SCOOBY-DOO, WHERE ARE YOU was a smash hit for CBS in the late 1960s--and after running the original cartoons into the ground the network ordered a new set. Titled SCOOBY'S ALL STARS, this particular set of cartoons shows the Mystery Inc. gang in standard form: Fred with the ascot, Daphne in a purple dress, Velma in an orange sweatshirt and red mini-skirt, and Shaggy in a t-shirt and brown pants, all of them instantly recognizable. Unfortunately, nothing in this group of cartoons is up to the level of the originals.

The first series was sloppy at times, with the characters inconsistently drawn--one episode shows Velma with lipstick and freckles; another shows Fred with such a square jaw it looks like he could glass with the corners of it; and so on. But even so, the shows had a specific look and style, especially in terms of background art. SCOOBY'S ALL STARS are more consistent, but they aren't nearly as interesting in terms of art or animation, and the stories have a very loose quality and lots of comic filler. The episodes are watchable, at times even enjoyable, but if this were the only cartoons made, the series wouldn't be nearly so fondly recalled.

On the plus side, the elements are good, and this three disk collection includes a half-hour documentary on Hanna-Barbera. It doesn't offer much insight into Scooby-Doo and the gang, and one interviewer comments that Scooby-Doo was partly inspired by the t.v. series THE MOD SQUAD--which doesn't seem too likely given that THE MOD SQUAD and the original SCOOBY-DOO hit television screens at about the same time. Nonetheless, it offers interesting insight into the animation studio and it is a nice compliment to this otherwise ho-hom set. Recommended for hardcore fans, but others should probably leave it alone.

2718511,4,B000M2E340,"I absolutely love Scooby Doo; it's my favorite cartoon franchise by far. The first and second seasons provided some great ideas and villains, and have become classics for good reason. Those were followed by a brief period of Scooby Doo movies, and after a brief hiatus, the Scooby Doo show from 1976-77, which contained some great episodes as well. By the time 1978 rolled around, it was becoming apparent that the writers were simply running out of ideas for villains. Villains such as the Willawaw, the Tar Monster, the Diabolical Disc Demon and the Jaguaro simply don't resonate as well as those classic villains from 1969-70. However, let me make one thing clear: the 16 episodes on this two disc set aren't bad at all--just not what I consider classic material. Another thing is the packaging: discs overlapping each other in the case, thereby increasing the chances of scratching.

I think it's borderline fraudulent to label this show as ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You"" when that's NOT the series being provided. The animation is different -- there are extra characters like Scooby's politically incorrect cousin ""Scooby-Dum"" and overall The Scooby-Doo Show simply isn't as entertaining as Scooby-Doo Where Are You?

HORRIBLE.  The monsters are stupid, the plots are lame, the mysteries are hardly mysteries at all.  And somehow, even though the gang travels overseas in most of these, there they are in the Mystery Machine.  So they drove across the ocean somehow.  I mean, yes it's a cartoon, but the first and second season at least followed some semblance of logic.

Unlike the first two seasons of Where Are You?, this show has Scoob and the gang trying to solve mysteries in a variety of new settings, like Japan, the mountains, even England.

Some fans didn't care for this new setting and I admit some aren't as good as the previous seasons, but that still doesn't take away from the classic feel of one of the all time goofiest and funniest cartoons around. I do admit I was not a fan of the added characters like Scoody Dum and Scrappy Doo, but thankfully they aren't featured a ton.

Disc 1

-Watch Out! The Willawaw: Here the gang is traveling by boat to visit Velma's uncle when they encounter a giant owl known as the Willawaw, so they try to find out what is behind the mysterious and screechy creature. Not a bad episode here.

-A Creepy Tangle In The Bermuda Triangle: Near the Bermuda Triangle the gang is on a boat partying, a storm hits damaging their boat, then they see the spaceship trap a weather plane, their boat crash lands on an island and they go to investigate the reasoning behind spaceships appearance. Decent one here.

-A Scary Night With A Snow Beast Fright: There's a giant snow creature/dinosaur that is wreaking havoc in the North Pole, which prompts the gang to come up and solve the mystery. Its a funny one at times and had some throwbacks to the other series, like Scooby and Shaggy dressing up to confuse the monster and the classic ""Meddling kids"" line is used.

-To Switch A Witch: On Halloween in the town of Old Salem a witch rises from the dead to terrorize the townsfolk, of course the kids and Scooby are coming to town visiting a friend that people claim is the witch. Looks like they must do their best to clear her name and capture the witch. Good one here.

-The Tar Monster: Up in the Turkish Mountains Scoob and Co. are visiting a professor who discovered an ancient city, so naturally scientific find brings a tar monster that tries to run off everyone, so its another mystery to be solved. Good one here.

-A Highland Fling With A Monstrous Thing: In Scotland, a friend of Velma's calls her to enlist her help in finding out the meaning behind an old highlander ghost and even the Lochness Monster appearing and running off the tourists of a castle she works at. Decent one here

Disc 2-Side A

-The Creepy Case Of Old Iron Face: While on a speed boat ride, the gang is chased by a man in a mask riding metal sharks, they get to the beach and find out about the legend of Skull Island and about the iron clad man they say earlier. Its an ok one.

-Jeepers, Its The Jaguaro!: In Brazil, their plane has to make an emergency landing in the jungles of the dreaded Jaguaro creature. So after Scooby and Shaggy run into it and with some headhunters after them, the natural plan is solve the mystery of the monster. This is an odd one to say the least.

-Make A Beeline Away From The Feline: Daphne's aunt transforms into a cat creature and is stealing jewelry for some reason, so once Scoob and his pals see this they try to find out why, clear the aunt's name and capture the culprit. Its a good one.

-The Creepy Creature of Vulture's Claw: On the way to visit a professor friend of Velma's the gang stumbles upon a mystery involving a weird mantis like creature. There's also a real estate agent who wants Velma's friend to sell his property to him, so guess what there's another investigation into the monster's motives. Not a bad one.

Disc 2-Side B

-The Diabolical Disc Demon: There's a weird phantom in a disco suit and kiss makeup that causes  the disappearance of a song writer, then the equipment in the studio malfunctions. So yet again the gang investigates the mystery of this phantom and try to find the missing song writer. An odd one.

-Scooby's Chinese Fortune Kooky Caper: While in China, the mystery machine gets a flat tire and the gang looks to stay the night at an old city inn when above all things a moon monster appears. So everyone tries to find out the meaning behind this creature. A decent one here. Side Note: If you don't laugh at the names of the people and the city they stay in then you're better than me, cause I kept laughing throughout.

-A Menace In Venice: In Italy (like the title didn't give that away), the gang is in town visiting a friend when they learn of a jewel thief named ""The Ghostly Gondolier"" and go on the search for clues to bust the criminal. A good one here.

-Don't Go Near The Fortress Of Fear: At a port in Puerto Rico they discover there's apparently some missing treasure that leads to an old fortress haunted by a ghost of an old general who likes to shoot of a cannon in the fortress. Well naturally Fred, Daphne and Velma are curious to explore while Shaggy and Scooby reluctantly join. A good one here.

-The Warlock Of Wimbledon: While on a run, two englishmen run into a goofy looking warlock who curses a tennis star to suffer a terrible fate. Once the gang runs into the tennis guy they decide to investigate this warlock curse. Good one here.

-The Beast Is Awake In Bottomless Lake: After taking a detour to avoid a flooded road, the gang ends up in Canada and finds out there's a beast at a camp resort (as if the title wasn't obvious enough). So after finding the resort deserted they decide to see whats behind this monster and the empty resort. Good one here.

The monster in the episode ""The Creepy Creature of Vulture's Claw"" is over 7' tall but the culprit in the costume is under 6', without any proper explanation, i.e. stilts. It's actually pretty funny when that happens. The worst of all-time is the episode ""Jeepers. It's the Jaguaro"" where the monster stands between 15'-20' tall and it turns out to be just a man in a costume, without any explanation as to how said costume could function so realistically for its enormous size.

After watching those to death, the prospect of some ""new"" (to our son) Scooby features had him glued to his seat; at least for the first 4-5 times he watches them.  These are supposed to be ""scary"" to those under the age of 5-7 but that doesn't phase our little guy.

I think I was getting out of high school when these first aired on TV so I never had(and still don't have) much interest in them.  But my wife who is a bit younger even remembers watching some of the episodes.  They have the ""original"" gang of characters (let's face it, Scrappy sucks) with the dependable, if predictable plot lines.

If you like your pancakes just the way mom used to make them, here they are with plenty of syrup.  If you're looking for ""Citizen Kane"", Francis Ford Coppola or Oliver Stone, like forget it, man (zoinks!). This and a good part of seasons 1&2 (double set) kept my little guy occupied for a good part of the time during two weeks of vacation (he also had regular fun and watched some more educational TV as well, but if he got bored or out of sorts, ""want to watch Scooby?"" usually got his attention). And of course, the ""monsters"" are not really real and nobody gets hurt.  Brain candy, don't eat too much...",1281744000,,1384,4.333333333333333
2718577,3,B000M2E340,"Okay, you've probably heard this several times over but, essentially, it bears repeating. This is actually the third season of ""The Scooby Doo Show"" which ran from 1976-1978. This is NOT Season 3 of ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"". There never was a season 3. However, these episodes were the unofficial third season of ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You!""(at least, in Hanna-Barbera's minds, anyways) which used the Original Series' 1969 opening intro/title & credits during its' original airing on TV. The box claims these are lost episodes but they are anything but, believe me. To be sure, all this is a might confusing.

With that out of the way, for the casual or hardcore fan of ol' Scoob, this is an excellent buy. While I don't care for Scrappy's appearance in the show, it is still classic Scoob.

2718580,3,B000M2E340,"The numbered Seasons of Scooby from 1969 to the late 80s are hard to keep track of. The 3rd Season of Scooby-Doo, Where are you is actually part of what was called Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics which featured several cartoons including ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" and ""The Blue Falcon & Dynomutt"" (who you might recognize from Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law) between 1977-1978. Even though this series aired years after the Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour, which is apparently considered a different series. Confused yet?

This season features all the usual unlikely villians, utterly ludicrous last-minute plot explanations and borderline xenophobic cultural stereotypes. The Scooby-Doo formula works best in isolated, creepy surroundings, but this season puts the action into too many urban areas, which just don't seem right. Monsters appearing during a Wimbledon tennis match and in a recording studio are the lowest points of the season.

The back of the box promotes the Season as ""lost episodes"". Well, I'm not sure where they were lost about but judging by the shocking quality of the prints I assume they were stored in someone's garage behind some old paint cans and a bag of cement gone hard. If you thought that the Tom and Jerry shorts from Warner looked bad then you ain't seen nothing yet.

Pick it up cheap if you're a Scooby-Doo completist.

2718581,4,B000M2E340,"Some people like Scooby Doo, Where Are You seasons 1 and 2 because these episodes show the original campy yet not too creepy format. I love those, too, but even when I was a little kid I preferred the later, creepier episodes. The kind I could watch in a darkened room with delicious chills. Perhaps I love them even more because they are considered 'lost' episodes. I rarely saw them after the early 80's. The labeling of later episodes by season is certainly confusing, and it is appreciated that some reviewers have clarified things by categorizing the episodes. I had not read anything about 'Season 3' before finding it in a store, and was just thrilled because it would surely have all my favorite lost episodes on it. (It doesn't, but many of them are included). Most of us fans refer to an episode by its villain, and this DVD has some great ones: the Cat Creature, Old Iron Face, the Tar Monster,  the Highland Ghost and Loch Ness Monster, and a recording studio phantom that looks like a bad version of Paul Stanley in stage makeup. There are a few mediocre episodes, and this is only because of lackluster villains. The gang tends to travel abroad a lot, creating possibilities besides conventional haunted houses. I think Velma's 'new' voice is still nerdy and fine, just lower pitched, and I like Daphne's second voice better than her first. It's still just a gang of five; cousin Dum doesn't join until later seasons. This DVD is a worthwhile addition for hardcore Scooby fans. NOTE: You will NOT find other obscure favorites like the Demon Shark, Gator Ghoul, No-Face Zombie, or Ice-Cream Phantoms in this collection. They are on the Scooby Doo/Dynomutt Hour Complete Series DVD, which is really great. And you won't find the Viking Ghosts or that awesome funeral parlor vampire episode either; they're considered episodes of the Scooby Doo Show. My only gripe about the Season 3 DVD is its packaging; I think all episodes should be listed on the outside cover. Some Scooby fans will spot it in stores before doing an online search!",1266451200,,2047,4.75
2718582,4,B000M2E340,"Well let me start off by saying. I have been  a Scooby doo fan for quite some time. i think i have seen all of the  different incarnations of him by now. I just love the series. It is the perfect thing to watch when you want something silly with just a hint of mystery. The gang never gets old.

This time around they are  on the go. They hit up  Venice, China (or Japan), New York, and various other places. Is there any place that  the Mystery  Machine can't go?

Well this season had several episodes that were quite familiar to me. For instance the make a Beeline away from The Feline. I remember watching that episode  growing up and being  kind of afraid. It is also one of my  favorite epsidoes. I rememebered the tennis episode where the warlock showed up. Is it me  or was the  whole ""invisible make up""  thing kind of a strectch. lol

I also enjoy the "" To Swith a Witch"", ""Old Iron Face"" and ""The Disc Denom"". The one about the creature in vulture's claw was  pretty good too. It was one of my favorites! I also was kind of creeped out  by the giant bug looking thing in this episode. All in all a great season i feel. there were only a few i didn't really like.  One of those being the  Jaguro episode. The stupid sound of the beast  drove me crazy. They  couldn't  found something that was a bit less annoying. That sound alone made me hate this one.

I think this is a good buy and I look  forward to purchasing more epsiodes.

I also found the sound annoying on the willawa episode. I really would have liked this episode more if it had less of that screeching owl.

I don't want to  forget the classic Tar Monster episode is also in this collection. It is also another oldie but goodie.

2718586,4,B000M2E340,"Since the others have already listed the episodes included in this set (and it's also listed in the item description), I won't go over it again.

For anyone that's a fan of the old show, it's an excellent buy.  The episodes here offer more than one ""suspect"" in each case, which can't often be said of the first two seasons.  Some of the episodes found here are as classic as the earlier shows of Scooby-Doo.  You won't be disappointed.

However, some episodes made during this time are mysteriously missing. There are even clips in the opening credits of episodes that are nowhere to be found in this set (like the 10,000-Volt Ghost).  The Gator Ghoul, the Headless Horseman and the gang's band friends that disappear leaving only voodoo dolls behind, are among some of my very favorite episodes.  Just know you won't find them here.

The only other problem seems to be with the DVD's themselves.  The set is packaged on two DVD's: one on a single, and the second is a two-sided disc.  It looks a bit odd when you open the package, as if the set was simply slapped together.  But the double-sided disc has often proven to be a problem with some DVD players, as seek times (laser finding the information) is a bit longer.  When inserting the two-sided disc, my DVD player found the info, but it took a few seconds longer to load up.

Overall, this set is definitely worth it, but if there are a few classic episodes you were hoping to find, read over the episode list first, as they may not be there.",1237593600,,1500,4.490774907749078

Scooby first premiered in 1969, and his first episode was What A Night For A Knight, and I had to check that I remembered the title correctly.  I hate to admit, but I was just a teenager then, and for me, Scooby became one of the cartoons I watched the most and had the most fun with.  Years later my own child watched and laughed at A Pup Named Scooby Doo, and I have to admit that over the years I lost track of Scooby until some years ago.  I rediscovered Scooby, and for a number of years was happy to come home from work and watch Scooby!  The Cartoon Network gave me an hourly dose of Scooby and I was happy.  Unfortnately, they have jetisoned Scooby and have gone on to become a somewhat soulless place.  I don't know why Amazon has gotten things mixed up, but these are not the first seasons of Scooby, but later years.  For the most part they're fine, in fact the one with the cat creature is really very funny.  Things go down hill with the introduction of the most horrible character ever created, Scrappy Doo.

how about the one with actress cousin Scooby Dee, the very pretty and charming all white dane!  All 3 scoobys were in that one so that would be missing off of here to!

It's got some very good episodes on it but like the MOVIE set is lacking!

I really am an over grown delinquent but hey gotta have some fun

I really don't think that there is another animated character that has had more different television series shows as Scooby Doo.  I know bye the mid 90's there were like 10 different series done I won't say they were good!!  But I do think is says an awful lot on Scooby's endearing popularity!

That their is NO DYNOMUTT thank gods!  The Scooby Doo / Dynomutt show was it's own title....and I'd really like to be able to Ignore that. but to get all my Scooby shows I guess I'll have to

the Laugh Olympics were again their own show, show allot of not often seen animated characters in crowd/group shots but not what I really want to see again.

The New Scooby Doo was good of all the gang

the Scooby & Scrappy Doo show well.....YACKED!  I kept hoping they would drop that obnoxious, overbearing, egotistical PUP! in a tar pit and let him SINK!!

then some of the 3 some sets...don't remember the first 2 series titles
Shaggy Scooby & Velma
Shaggy Scooby & Daphne
Shaggy Scooby & Vincent Van Ghoul....that was the 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo
and really you didn't have vincent on that much....Vincent Price Voiced him hence why I watched that one in the mid 90's but had an annoying kid side kick...Flim-Flam.  Ya that name about summed up that character

Oh me
guess I'll have to be picking up more than I want to but I do love my Whole Gang Scooby shows!

Say does anyone know where the cross over with Goober and The Ghost Chasers is on DVD or doesn't it exist yet??",1209254400,3,2528,4.2974683544303796

Well, if you think about it the other scooby cartoons are so different from the Scooby Doo Where Are You Series and this DVD contains the episodes that most resemble the original. I may be wrong but the episodes which featured the celebrities such as Don Knotts and The Three Stooges in 1972 were so different they did not consider it part of the Where Are You? Series. When they came out with This season originally it was Titled The Scooby Doo Show. These episodes most resemble the original shows. I believe they were intended to follow up as the third season of Scooby Doo Where Are You? The confusion to me is why it was not titled Scooby Doo Where Are You? Season 3 in 1976? In Either case they are the only Scooby Doo Episodes that are as enjoyable to watch as the original.",1191196800,,898,4.288235294117647

The New Scooby-Doo Movies actually came between these two series. It had a different theme song with different titles. Velma doesn't even have the same voice. And Pat Stevens doesn't do as good a job as Mindy Cohn in What's New, Scooby-Doo. How about a little truth in advertising?

That said, these episodes are a mixed bag. Some are pretty good, some less good. No Scooby-Dum, Scooby-Dee or Scrappy is a definite plus. But many of the gags are just too silly, and the spooks are so strange they  give the impression that the writers ran out of ideas. The art and animation are not generally up to the old Where Are You standards, either.

2718612,4,B000M2E340,"I was very excited to see this, the 3rd season of Scooby Doo Where Are You, available on DVD.  I have watched the first two seasons over and over.  I was even more excited when I ran down the list of episodes and realized that I hadn't seen most of them!  I even found myself laughing out loud at some of the humor in the first couple of episodes.  All the shows were great and I can't wait to re-watch them.  The breakdown on this two disc set is as follows:

Disc One:
Watch Out!  The Willawaw
A Creepy Tangle in the Bermuda Triangle
A Scary Night with a Snow Beast Fright
To Switch a Witch
The Tar Monster
A Highland Fling with a Monstrous Thing

Disc Two Side One:
The Creepy Case of Old Iron Face
Jeepers, It's the Jaguaro (hmmmm, doesn't quite rhyme, does it?)
Make a Beeline Away from That Feline
The Creepy Creature of Vulture's Claw
The Diabolical Disc Demon

Disc Two Side Two:
Scooby's Chinese Fortume Kooky Caper
A Menace in Venice
Don't Go Near the Fortress of Fear
The Warlock of Wimbledon
The Beast is Awake in Bottomless Lake

plus a couple of extras:  An interview with people who worked producing the Hanna-Barbera cartoons including footage of Mr Hanna and Mr Barbera.  It was actually pretty good.  Plus the usual ""Hey look at what Scooby Doo DVDs are available"" trailer.",1184716800,,1291,4.419491525423729
2718613,1,B000M2E340,"Sorry, but this set is for the dogs. It's like having been served up a packet cake mix after enjoying a really high quality cake made with many rich ingredients. These episodes highlight why the originals were so great with the blend of fabulous backgrounds, detailed drawings, great scripts and the all important ""Scooby"" music which just oozes atmosphere and makes the whole show gel together. These ""lost"" episodes were made years after the original series and it's pretty obvious they're just not the same. There are the odd scenes reminiscent of the original but on the whole it's all the excitement of a packet mix plus one egg - the scripts are poor, the scenary is by and large dull and the music is just not right. Let's not get started on how Velma talks - I think she must have taken some slow pills just before recording the dialogue. If you must have it, maybe buy it with a friend to offload some of the disappointment. At least Scrappy wasn't there to make a bland recipe unedible.",1183334400,4,996,4.569832402234637

2718615,4,B000M2E340,"This is probably one of the most confusing seasons of Scooby-Doo released for television, and now on DVD. And based on alot of mis-information associated with this product, it's even more confusing. If you are easily bored with history lessons, then skip this review.

The 1978-1979 Saturday morning TV season saw the premiere of 16 new Scooby-Doo episodes. The ABC Saturday morning TV schedule for September 1978 was as follows:

.....08:00-08:30 AM EST Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!
.....08:30-09:00 AM EST Fangface
.....09:00-10:00 AM EST Challenge of the Super Friends
.....10:00-11:30 AM EST Scooby's All-Stars
.....11:30-12:00 PM EST The All-New Pink Panther Show

These new Scooby-Doo episodes began airing under the Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! show at 8:00 AM EST, using the original 1969 opening credits, just with all new shows. Yes, really! The 90 minute Scooby's All-Stars show was composed of a half hour of new and repeat episodes of the Laff-a-Lympics, a half hour of new and repeat episodes of Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels, and a half hour of repeat ONLY episodes of Scooby-Doo from the previous 1976-1977 and 1977-1978 seasons.

After only 9 weeks, the popular Challenge of the Super Friends show was expanded from 60 minutes to 90 minutes, adding an extra half hour of repeats from their 1977-1978 season. Thus, ABC shuffled it's Saturday morning TV schedule as follows:

.....08:00-09:30 AM EST Scooby's All-Stars
.....09:30-11:00 AM EST Challenge of the Super Friends
.....11:00-11:30 AM EST Fangface
.....11:30-12:00 PM EST The All-New Pink Panther Show

The remaining 7 new Scooby-Doo episodes then began airing during the half hour Scooby-Doo portion of the 90 minute Scooby's All-Stars show. This remained the status quo, and all 16 new Scooby-Doo episodes from this season were then repeated throughout the remainder of the season as part of Scooby's All-Stars.

What confuses everyone is that the 16 new episodes from this season, PLUS the 16 Scooby-Doo episodes from the 1976-1977 season of The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour, PLUS the 8 Scooby-Doo episodes from the 1977-1978 season of Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics (16 + 8 + 16 = 40 episodes in total) were re-packaged together as ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" for syndication repeats starting in 1980. So most folks only know these episodes from the syndication repeats airing on cable networks like Cartoon Network or Boomerang, and NOT from their original airings. It was NEVER called ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" during any of the original ABC Saturday morning airings.

Unfortunately, the DVD set is named and advertised as if it's the original airings of these 16 episodes. But they are NOT! The DVD set has the syndicated re-packaged versions with ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" opening and closing credits, and NOT the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! or Scooby's All-Stars opening and closing credits as they originally aired.

So, whether you think of these episodes as Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! Season 3, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Lost Episodes, Scooby's All-Stars, or even ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" Season 3, it is the COMPLETE, yes, COMPLETE 1978-1979 Saturday morning season of Scooby-Doo with the same 16 episodes, just with the syndicated re-packaged opening and closing credits. There are no missing episodes from this season set. If you are a fan of this late 70's era of Scooby-Doo, (just before the coming of Scrappy-Doo), you will greatly enjoy the 16 episodes on this set.

My only fear now is that when they get around to releasing the Hanna-Barbera animated DVD sets of, oh say, The Adventures of Gulliver, or even The Atom Ant Show, we're going to get the syndicated re-packaged version from ""The Banana Splits and Friends Show""....",1182124800,232,3718,5.202341137123746

2718618,4,B000M2E340,"Although marketed and titled as ""The Complete 3rd SEason"", two things must be made clear.  First, this is not Scooby-Doo, Where are You, which only ran for 2 seasons from 1969-1971.  These episodes come from the ""Scooby-Doo Show"" which ran from 1976-1979, at one point in conjunction with the Dynomutt show.

Second, this is not a complete season--several episodes are missing, but those that are missing are avilable for download on I-tunes.",1179878400,5,442,5.111111111111111

It contains none of the Scooby Dum episodes (Gator Ghoul, Headless Horseman, Vampire Hotel) and doesn't have the 10,000 volt ghost episode, despite these episodes being shown in the opening credits/song for every episode on the DVD's.  I assume that they'll be a season four coming out soon, but I'd have gladly paid more for all the All Star episodes in one collection.

These do follow the original formula, but the stories are more contrived i.e. the characters are in a different country in every episode, it seems.

Overall, not bad, great if you're wanting the entire collection or something for the kids to watch. It's closer to the original series that everyone loved, but not quite the same. I gave it three stars(of five)",1179360000,3,420,4.819444444444445

I find the different voices distracting.  Velma floats in and out of a nerdy voice and sometimes almost sounds like Daphne.  I hate the opening theme AND the appearance of Scooby Dum in the opening credits.  These definitely have a cheaper feel to them though for most people less picky than myself, they're probably fine.  As mentioned, these are from the mid 70s, not the late 60s/early 70s...the music reflects this as does an AWFUL and distracting laugh track.  I think the most responsible review is to say that they're adequate.  Lacking any more of the ORIGINAL episodes, they're an ok second.  I think it's despicable labelling them as ""Season 3"" as they're more definitely NOT season 3.",1179100800,9,871,4.917808219178082

But yet these are not re-runs at the time of their airing...as it's been said, there were only 2 seasons worth of shows of the original program. Throughout the '70s ABC and then CBS and local affiliates would re-package Scooby shows and slap on whatever title they wanted. Anyone remember the Scooby short episodes? Ones that ran like 10-15 minutes at the most? Daphne had shorter hair and acted as a news reporter...Scooby of course was in it...Shaggy i believe wore a red shirt...and yes, Scrappy was on the show. I read the reviews saying the opening on here shows Scooby water skiing...well, that was the same opening they used on the other DVD collection: Scooby-Doo/DYNOMUTT Hour.",1177804800,,880,4.720779220779221

2718632,5,B000M2E340,"Review Forward: I know much of this has already been said, but I leave it in for consolidation purposes...

This is actually the third season of ""The Scooby Doo Show"" which ran from 1976-1978. This is NOT Season 3 of ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"", the original Scooby Doo series which initially aired for two seasons in 1969 and 1970. There never was a season 3 of ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You"" in 1970 or 1971.

NOTE, however, that according to animation expert Earl Kress, these 1978 episodes were the unofficial ""third season"" of ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You!"" released MUCH later, and utilizing the Original Series' 1969 opening intro/title & credits. It supposedly aired as ""Where Are You?"" on the East Coast from September through December 1978 before being incorporated into the ""Scooby's All-Stars"" show. This 1978 broadcast was canceled after ""Who Was That Cat Creature I Saw You With Last Night?"", and the remaining seven third-season episodes were aired during the ""Scooby's All-Stars"" block and revamped to use ""The Scooby Doo Show"" title/intro & credits for its subsequent airings in syndication.

This Season 3 DVD uses ""The Scooby Doo Show"" intro which starts ""He's got it all together for a brand new show, Scooby Doo is here and away we go"".

2718635,5,B000M2E340,"I still love Scooby after all these years. My boys love to watch them and we have family nights where they pick the movies and at least once a month we watch Scooby! Maybe it's some subliminal thing in the drawings but Scooby gets old,I still get a kick from him. My youngest son started sleeping by himself and got rid of his fear of the dark(well almost his fear of the dark) because of Scooby! I am happy to add this to our collection! Now we need the rest of the Scooby movies and I'll be overjoyed. As for Crappy... I mean Scrappy-doo, he was the death of saturday morning cartoons in my eyes and will NEVER EVER enter my house!!! even my boys think he should be droped at the Pound!!!",1176249600,7,690,4.195488721804511
2718636,5,B000M2E340,There's too much drama going on in this discussion! I don't really care about what year these episodes came out or that there are 9 missing episodes of the New Scooby Doo Movies. I'm just glad there's more Scooby!!!,1175558400,4,215,4.538461538461538
2718637,4,B000M2E340,"1969 and 1970 where the first 2 and only ""Scooby Doo, Where are You?"" seasons.  1973 Came the disappointment of the ""Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo Show"", on Sat. mornings.  Also appearing during the week day at 4:00pm were ""The Scooby Doo Mysteries"", starring various famous people/voices (Davy Jones, Don Knotts, Don Adams, Bat Man & Robin,....etc.).  There were originally 2-part episodes.  Then in 1976 not 78, came the return of the entire gang, every Sat. morning (then week days) in ""The Scooby Doo Show"", which if the list is correct from a previous reviewer, in fact is (featuring the opening with Scooby Doo water skiing....""Got it all together for a brand new show, Scooby Doo is here and away we go..."").

I don't know why this new collection is being released as ""...Where are you,"" Season 3, when it never existed in the first place.  Maybe, because the ""Where are you"" seasons, were the best.  Leaving all others to fall short of our high expectations.  The ""Where are you"" seasons started a whole new mystery genre in cartoons on Sat. mornings.  Does anyone remember, just to name a few, The Bufford Files, The Gallopping Ghost, Clue Club or the Chan Clan?  Hanna-Barbera at their best.  Those were the days when cartoons were made in big studios like Warner Bros., Paramount, MGM and they were funny and entertaining.  Not the scary, sci-fi fantasy they have now.  None of the current ""Cartoons"" will ever be considered classics 20, 30, 40 years from now, because technology changes but comedy and laughter are constant.",1175472000,7,1533,4.827586206896552
2718638,5,B000M2E340,"I am happy this DVD will be released soon. These episodes are from the ""Scooby's All Stars"" series. They were made to resemble the first seasons of Scooby in their mystery and format. To many, these are known as the ""lost episodes"" of ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"". This will not be ""The New Scooby Doo Movies"" because that collection is already out, although not in it's entirety. Many fans are greatful to see these coming out, because many of these episodes have not been seen on tv in years. [...]",1170806400,,500,4.5054945054945055
2718639,5,B000M2E340,"Travis Deputy's list is correct.

Wikipedia is pretty accurate right now, under ""the Scooby-Doo Show"".

But, what's really important: NO SCRAPPY-DOO, NO SCOOBY-DUM!

I hated them as a kid, and I hate them more looking back with kids of my own. Hoo-boy, do I hate them.

So I don't care if these are episodes that have been packaged three or four different ways - all I care about is that those stains on the Scooby franchise have been cleaned off, for these 16 episodes at least.",1170720000,30,479,4.534883720930233
2718640,5,B000M2E340,"I am excited for more Scooby-Doo to be coming out though I am not sure if anyone who has posted a review really knows what they are talking about.  This is not the rest of the Scooby Doo Movies, because 2/3 of them have already been released on ""The Best of"" DVD and they wouldn't title the rest of them Season Three of Scooby Doo where are you.  The next Scooby Doo series which had three seasons is The Scooby Doo Show.  The epsidoes from the first season of that series are on the Scooby-Doo Dynomutt Hour DVD.  The review two down from mine claims this DVD will have the epsiodes of the third season of The Scooby Doo show on it, which may be possible, but why would they skip the release of the second season?  Warner Brothers is trying to confuse us!!  I am excited to find out what this DVD truely is!",1170201600,4,808,4.180645161290323

For more details on this topic, see The Scooby-Doo Show.
For the 1978-1979 television season, Hanna-Barbera produced sixteen episodes of a third season of Scooby-Doo, Where are You! for broadcast on ABC. These episodes follow the episodes of Scooby-Doo made in 1976 and 1977 for ABC, and are more similar to those episodes than the 1969-1971 originals except that Scooby-Dum, a semi-regular character from the 1976 and 1977 episodes, does not appear.

ABC began airing these episodes on Saturday mornings at 8:00 AM EST beginning in September 1978. The show was canceled in November 1978 after nine episodes; the remaining seven first-run episodes were broadcast during ABC's Scooby's All-Stars block at 10:00 AM, which was originally broadcasting reruns of the 1976 and 1977 episodes. These 1978 episodes have been aired in syndication as part of The Scooby-Doo Show since the 1980s, but are to be released on DVD under the title ""'Scooby-Doo, Where are You!: The Complete Third Season.",1170028800,8,1021,5.225609756097561
