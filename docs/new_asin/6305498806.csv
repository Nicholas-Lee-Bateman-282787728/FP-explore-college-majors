7890569,5,6305498806,"An overall excellent tape, with only one bad fight, and with one true classic.  One of the earlier MMA competitions with weight classes, it has  4-man tournaments at 160, 200, and 200+.  The Zinoviev-Sperry match was  incredible.  Before this, I'd only seen Zinoviev 'fight' Frank Shamrock.  The only poor fight was in the lightweights, Carlson Gracie, Jr. versus  John Lewis.  Lewis is really good, and so is Carlson, I guess, but this is  the only time I've seen Carlson fight.  It looked to me like Lewis would  have won the fight if he'd been more aggressive.  No judges, so they get a  draw.",965606400,,596,4.669902912621359
