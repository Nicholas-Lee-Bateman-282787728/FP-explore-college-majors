8135690,3,B000H0M3XU,This is opinion of a group of people I don't agree with their opinion on the 10 best cars that changed America I'd say DVD is worth the money for the knowledge and that's entertainment it was good nice car knowledge presented here. My opinion this DVD great to watch. But will be on a shelf for a long time before I watch it again. OLD TIMER,1377734400,,341,4.104477611940299

8135692,4,B000H0M3XU,"Cars That Changed the Automobile Industry is a decent video. The classic car selections (pre 1960) are more valid than the modern era selections. For example, it lists the Toyota Corona, not the Toyota Camry which arguably  has had far more impact on Toyota in the U.S. Likewise, it lists the Jeep Wagoneer, nor the Ford Explorer or even the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which helped kick off the SUV era. It's fun to see some of the older cars, however, and it's a good video to kick off a car discussion. I hope A&E will update this series, since the data in this video dates from 1998.",1200787200,5,580,4.420560747663552
