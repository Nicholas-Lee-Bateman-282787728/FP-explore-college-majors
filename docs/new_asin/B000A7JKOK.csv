2377819,5,B000A7JKOK,"My friends and I were at Legends (a strip club in London, Ontario) when they were filming the dancers last summer. I didn't get interviewed like the previous reviewer did, but it was still a pretty wild night. The club was really packed that night and there were plenty of cute dancers. My favourite is Southern Heat, a really cute latino guy. Since none of these dancers were from London, I was hoping to get a copy this documentary from TV, but now that it's comming out on DVD I just buy that. I wonder what they put into the deleted scenes section.",1123891200,3,552,4.368932038834951
2377820,5,B000A7JKOK,"I missed this when it was on TV, now finally I can get the DVD. I'm hoping that my interview was not cut out. I was in the club where they were filming this last year. That was a wild night! The strippers were really sexy. If you have never been at a male strip club this film will give you a nice introduction.",1123718400,,311,3.875
8075593,1,B000A7JKOK,"Too much audience comments and not enough stripping.  Show is just plain dirty which is not to say
it's not fun to observe.  Thought the men were not particularly handsome or personable in interacting
with the ladies.  Would like to see a video with all dancing!

And this is from a male who appreciates  male beauty!",1404259200,,317,4.589285714285714
8075594,1,B000A7JKOK,"This video was not any good at all, please don't waste your money. I am a male and I really thought that they where going to show alot more and better looking men and it wasn't. Whoever was the camera man and the director need to really watch nude men,at times it seeems like he didn't want to show  alot of the men waist down....yeah you see something once in awhile but it seems to me that more women in the audience had alot of camera time. It really was not worth the money and It could have been alot better. Women or Gay Men could have shot this video better and given better sceans. I can't believe I wasted my money on this video.... but wait, on the cover of the video it has ""Director's Cut""!!!! He should have cut more and put in more men and instead of showing the upper body and eyes he should have worked on the lighting in the club better and showed why people really go to see exotic male dancers.",1342483200,3,913,4.129213483146067
8075595,3,B000A7JKOK,"Okay DVD.  Delivery was excellent.  It was informative, but not great.  Fun to watch.",1241740800,,85,4.928571428571429
8075596,1,B000A7JKOK,"BEWARE! This is one of the worst videos EVER! It consists mostly of a lot of screaming girls, mostly blonds, making fools of themselves. In no instance does a stripper do a complete performance. The production values are nil. The lighting is too dim to show even the brief performaces. This video is a complete ripoff. I'm tossing mine into the waste bin.",1208044800,10,355,4.650793650793651
8075597,5,B000A7JKOK,"This is an exceptionally entertaining and thought provoking documentary. It is quite insightful when it comes to unraveling the not so glamorous life of male dancing. Filmed entirely on location it provides a great atmosphere and it is filled with funny comments (as some of the other reviewers already pointed out). Listening to the dancers' audio commentary is well worth the price alone. I do not understand why some people are complaining about the lack of nudity in this film, since there is plenty. It is not a triple X film people, get a grip! Nevertheless, it is well worth its price, and if for nothing else it would make you check out one of these shows for real.",1152144000,6,673,4.663865546218488
8075598,2,B000A7JKOK,"I viewed this DVD and would give it a 1 out of 5 stars. This is great if you are in college and researching male dancers or something but otherwise it's kind of lame. It shows about 5 dancers in one club and they interview various women in the club and get their opinions about strippers. I still have not made the connection as to why Ron Jeremy has anything to do with this documentary! Ladies, if you are expecting to see skin, this DVD shows very little. Others may have a limmited  interest if you have followed the male dancer trends in the US.",1137974400,19,550,4.238095238095238
8075599,4,B000A7JKOK,"""Hello World"", well stated from the cowboy!!

This film is awesome entertainment!!  It's right to the point. For me, half the movies these days are just a recycled product over and over again.  Even though this is a documentary, it's different!  It's something I never seen before, things that did not interest me in this movie, interested my friend.  It is a very well balanced film.  I also liked the way this film ended.",1136937600,5,423,4.648648648648648
8075600,5,B000A7JKOK,"I bought this DVD for my girlfriend for Xmas (don't ask me why), and we ended up watching it together over the holidays. I'm not really into documentaries, but I have to say I was surprised by how candidly this film shows the lives of these dancers. And yes, there is a lot of behind the scenes footage that shows what these dancers are actually doing in their dressing rooms. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen this film yet, but it really lives up to its title ""RAW, EXPOSED, UNTOLD"". I'm not sure if certain drug snorting scenes were actually faked or not, but this is really something I haven't seen anywhere else. I can't really comment on the guys, though my girlfriend seemed to be pleased with the more revealing images. So I'm pretty sure if you're a horny female or gay male you'll get your own entertainment, but surprisingly there is lot more to this film than just displaying seemingly endless moments of naked male bodies. Why? Because some of these guys (dancers) are the most hilarious people I've seen in a while. Especially BODYHEAT ""Sex, Drugs and Rock & Roll, that's all it's about, yeah baby!"". That guy makes this documentary (well, for straight guys anyways). I'm glad that there are some breaks in the film where I didn't have to stare at naked guys (well, not completely naked guys), and these scenes are really funny. Some of these dancers just cracked me up. I have to tell you that I was pleasantly surprised, though intially I only started watching this because my girlfriend made me (afterall I bought it for her!). Believe it or not a few days later I made my friends watch this film, though this time we watched it with the dancer's audio commentary. First they were giving me those odd, worry some looks, but by the time we finished it everyone was glad that I showed them this DVD. The raw version of the dancer's audio track is a real riot (Warning: this track is more fun if you're a straight guy, because nothing is left untouched). You can hear the guys as they pour their drinks and they slowly get drunk as the movie rolls on. By the end of the track they are all piss drunk, I never heard anything like this before. I guess the makers of this film were not kidding when they came up with their title for the movie. My only regret is that Bodyheat was not present when they recorded the commentary tracks, that's a real shame, he is the funniest guy ever. Maybe all that snorting finally got to him? Anyways, this documentary is a great entertainment whether you're female, straight or gay male there is something for everyone, and I really mean it! One last warning though, beware because your girlfriend may suggest taking you to a male strip show after viewing this film. DOH!",1136592000,18,2742,4.519114688128773
8075601,4,B000A7JKOK,"I watched this dvd with some friends(thumbs up) and this doc rocks! The first time I watched this, I thought that I would be mostly looking away; but did not. I feel if you watch this documentary it's a good idea to keep an open mind and chances are you will be entertained.",1126224000,4,274,4.188679245283019
8075602,4,B000A7JKOK,"I have had the priviledge of viewing this and found it to be very insightful into the world of exotic male dancers, and trust me it delivers!!  From start to finish, this film keeps you totally involved and interested in what really happens.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!!",1124064000,4,290,4.666666666666667
