The second half of the season was much better with Lauren Lane taking over. If she had been Hunter's primary partner the entire season it is possible the series could have actually have had an official final season with Season 8 instead of leaving looses ends at the end of Season 7.",1484697600,,428,4.571428571428571

8312637,4,B001JAHQJ8,"I can hardly wait till HUNTER's 1990-91 Season comes out on DVD, because even though HUNTER's 7th Season left us mourning the loss of Hunter's hot looking original partner(Sgt. Dede McCall), it was still kind of interesting seeing Hunter getting a new partner twice, especially since Hunter was never really partnered up with any other female officer during the first 6 seasons throughout HUNTER's whole 7-year run on NBC.

Therefore you could say it was kind of an interesting transition seeing Los Angeles police Sgt. Dede McCall(Stephanie Kramer)getting replaced by the foxy Los Angeles police Detective Joanne Molenski(Darlanne Fluegel) on this police drama in the Fall of 1990 and seeing Hunter getting another new partner in the second half of this 1990-1991 Season when Molenski gets replaced by the sexy Los Angeles police Sgt. Christine Novak(Lauren Lane)in the ""Fatal Obsession"" episode when Novak's predecessor(Molenski) gets killed off in the Winter of 1991.

This is also the season when both Los Angeles police Sgt. Hunter(Fred Dryer) and his superior officer Los Angeles police Capt. Devane(Charles Hallahan) transfer to the LAPD's Metro Division along with Hunter's new partners Novak and Molenski as well as the season when Hunter's new fellow LAPD officers Righetti(Joe Bucci) and Dorsey(Ronald William Lawrence) join the cast & crew of this show.

This is also the season when Hunter gets a new unmarked unit by replacing his mossy green '77 Dodge Monaco with Hunter's brand spankin new sky blue '91 Ford Crown Victoria.

Unfortunately this was the season when the ratings on this police drama went downhill, which I'm sure was initially due to the fact that Molenski's predecessor(McCall) was no longer on this show since Stepfanie Kramer had left the due to differences Kramer had with Dryer behind the set since rumor has it that Dryer didn't get along with Kramer in real life just like Erik Estrada(Ponch) and Larry Wilcox(Jon) didn't get along in real life behind the set of CHiPs along with the fact that the show HUNTER wasn't quite the same without McCall's face or spunky personality in it, which was kind of like it was when Ponch's original partner Jon Baker(Larry Wilcox) left CHiPs in the Spring of 1982 and got replaced by Bobby Nelson(Tom Reilly) in the Fall of 1982 leaving us to mourn the loss of Bobby's predecessor(Jon), but I peronally thought Novak was the prettiest partner of Hunter's of them all, despite the fact that this show tanked during its last season and cancelled in the Summer of 1991, due to a nose-dive in ratings.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars in this 1990-1991 Season like
*Former Los Angeles police Chief Daryl Gates doing a cameo appearance in the ""Fatal Obsession"" episode

*Don Rickles in the ""Ex Marks The Spot"" episode

*Mitch Pileggi in ""The Incident"" episode before his co-starring days on THE X-FILES

*Ismael Carlo in the ""Where Echoes End"" episode after his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL and before his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Joe Santos in the ""Mi Familia"" episode after his co-starring days as down-on-his-luck private investigator Jim Rockford's often agrivated cop buddy(Det. Dennis Becker) on THE ROCKFORD FILES

*Paul Linke in the ""Acapulco Holiday"" episode after his co-starring days as Jon & Ponch's fellow CHP Officer Artie Grossman on CHiPs

*Gregory Allen-Williams in the ""Under Suspicion"" episode and the ""Where Echoes End"" episode after his co-starring days as Officer Garner Ellerbee on BAYWATCH",1239321600,3,3515,5.1276223776223775
