5929726,5,B00EOBB866,Hard to find and at a great price!  One of the great movies to watch on a long weekend with someone to care about.,1399766400,,114,3.75
5929727,5,B00EOBB866,"Even though it was in black and white, I enjoyed it more than the one with Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark.",1397779200,,106,4.095238095238095
5929728,4,B00EOBB866,"Today's viewers should not be afraid of Goodbye, Mr. Chips, its old fashioned sentimentalism still holds up, and it has that proverbial ""they don't make them like that anymore"" quality.  Based on the novel by James Hilton, the unsung Victorian schoolteacher Mr. Chips is seen as a symbol of proverbial English reserve; he takes years to become popular with his students, finds love late in life, then tragically loses it, and retires believing he has never been truly appreciated.  But his simple perseverance becomes incredibly emotional.  Robert Donat was a major star in the 30's, and his understated performance here won him an Oscar.",1392595200,,638,5.115384615384615
5929729,5,B00EOBB866,"Forever a classic.  B&W film from 1939, when England faced sending men to stop German and, soon, Japanese military aggression.  A gentle, decent story from an earlier time: a shy teacher finds love that changes his life, and who in turn, affects the lives of generations of British school boys at a very traditional boarding school.  Great acting, great filming, great sentiment.",1391558400,2,379,5.080645161290323
5929730,5,B00EOBB866,"This movie came during Hollywood's best year for cinema. Out of all the great movie's of that year,this was perhaps that top movie of that year. It has great acting and of course a heart touching story line. Just a fabulous movie.",1387411200,2,230,4.5
5929731,5,B00EOBB866,"Purchased for a friend, Sylvia, 91 yrs old. Getting for a relative, just could not figure out how to do it.. Told her I could manage it for her in ten minutes!  When I got it, she immediately had to know the price! Told her ten dollars, now we will fight over that.
Tough time accepting things. I will prevail.

Relatively new to Amazon, absolutely amazed at your operation. Flawless is the word.

Thanks!",1384473600,,405,4.445945945945946
5929732,5,B00EOBB866,"I chose this rating because it was more than I expected, High Definition, wide screen and very clear to the eye, Great quality.

I first tried getting this movie through ""Turner Classic Movies"" but they absolutely won't carry this movie for sale. I will be dealing with you more in the future.

I have already shared it with a few friends and loved ones and they loved it. My Son is teaches 7, 8, high school and Baker College one night a week in Owasso, MI",1382918400,,457,4.3023255813953485

5929736,4,B00EOBB866,"My first encounter with Goodbye, Mr. Chips was the one with Martin Clune in it.  I really enjoyed that version.  After watching this version three times, I must admit it has its own charm.  Good movie.",1485475200,,201,4.527777777777778
5929737,5,B00EOBB866,"One of the best movies ever made. Though it is out of the thirties, and about a subject very few have ever experienced, it remains some of the best acting ever, but especially Robert Donat. It is no wonder he won the Academy Award that year.

I'm a sucker for sad songs and sad movies, so of course I tear up very time I watch it. But even if sad movies are not your thing, this movie is so upliftingly sad and sweet and beautiful and inspiring that if you don't tear up, too, you must be a zombie. The only movie that comes close in comparison is A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Buy that one, too!",1484352000,,592,4.05982905982906

5929744,3,B00EOBB866,"It is a great movie but wouldn't play on my DVD player.  As it came from England, it is perhaps due to
the different voltage and cycles available here as opposed to there.  Consequently, it may just be that
either I ordered the wrong product or the wrong one was accidentally shipped.",1473033600,,284,4.4423076923076925

Edit: I admit, I bought this for my mother. That being said, I really, REALLY enjoyed it. I personally think it's better than the new musical version.

5929782,4,B00EOBB866,"This was a CreateSpace DVD manufactured on demand for Amazon which the product description says ""looks like the discs you're used to.""  The case and disc certainly look authentic, but I was disappointed in the quality of the video.  Usually when you step up from a VHS to a DVD there is a very noticeable increase in detail/quality.  This DVD has a barely noticeable improvement in quality.  I suspicion that CreateSpace used something less than the original film as the master for their copy.  Possibly this is the best quality medium available for a film this old.  It would be nice to have this noted in the product detail since it sounds like Amazon is CreateSpace's primary customer for these copies.",1418169600,2,705,4.785123966942149

On his way he will make several mistakes and learn from them. The movie has the feel of several stories running in series that all tie in to Chipping's life. He is also destined to meet the love of his life Katherine (Greer Garson) and see that the Danube is blue.

I do not want to go into a detail as that is the fun in watching eh stories unfold however I think it is significant when Chipping and Katherine are alone on the top of the world and time stops finding them selves in eternity. He also gets an insight or different slant of his carrier.",1500508800,,692,4.242424242424242
