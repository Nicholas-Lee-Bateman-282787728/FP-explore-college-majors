6878686,5,B00QSO7VD6,"I love the Beauty and Beast story, Vincent Cassel, and Brotherhood of the Wolf.  So I was eager to see this and a little worried it would be a letdown.  Happy to say this is my new favorite rendition and even tops the Jean Cocteau and Disney versions which I also like.

The overall dreamlike visuals and fairy tale feel is perfect.  The beast looked great (arguably the trickiest and most important piece to pull off the movie.)  Acting was great.  Costumes were lovely although I found myself thinking most of Beauty's outfits looked as uncomfortable as they were eye catching.  Special effects were good and really enhanced the story.  I really liked the Beast's backstory woven into the main storyline --- those familiar with other fairy tales and Greek myths may recognize some familiar themes on broken promises there.

On the downside, I felt too much time was spent on Beauty's initial family story that would have been better spent  on showing us her growing relationship with the Beast at the castle.  Also I did not care at all for the castle servant/gremlin/dogs.  I just found them ugly and creepy.  I guess it may be my preference for larger wolf-like dogs rather than squealing alien rats.

I would say this is kid friendly although they did have a pretty hot (but fully clothed) bedroom scene with the Prince and his wife --- thank you, Vincent! et vive la France --- and a totally appropriate non-sexual nude seen with strategic angle cover up.  Also, I prefer all my foreign films in original language with subtitles and kids may need to go for a dub or be ok with practicing fast reading and/or their French language skills.

At one point this DVD was selling for about $40 and I had no idea if it would really play on a US player.  So I took a chance off this listing and ordered it via an amazon seller for about half the price and thankfully it did play on a US player.",1435622400,30,1891,4.530973451327434

6878689,5,B00QSO7VD6,What a great movie! I would say that it is definitely worth the purchase. This is in DVD format although I've heard the blue ray edition is beautiful as well. And it is compatible with American DVD players so it is Region 1. It also has English subtitles as well. So for those of you who have been waiting for this version of the movie look no further; it is definitely worth it.,1430784000,58,379,4.205479452054795

6878694,4,B00QSO7VD6,"Of course, the definitive Beauty and the Beast film is French. Of course the director is Christophe Gans, easily one of my favorite living film directors. It's in French with very good subtitles. The elaborations from the original plot are beautifully done. The scenery and effects are lavish. The acting is wonderful. The effect of the film is enchantment, as expected and desired.

The only flaw I found was the lack of adequate introduction to Belle's irresponsible, indebted brother who is the effective catalyst of the story. If only Christophe Gans had a 'continuity girl' to help with plot coherence. A similarly thin character introduction occurs in Gans' otherwise amazing 'Silent Hill' film.",1496620800,,701,5.20353982300885

6878698,2,B00QSO7VD6,"Visually, this is by far the most stunning of the Beauty and the Beast adaptations that I have seen. The Beast's castle and the surrounding environment provide a more fantastical and fairy-tale like atmosphere that is pleasing to look at. The origin story of how the Prince became the Beast is an interesting, original twist on how one's own selfish desires can cause their downfall, and was woven into the main story well, despite the fact the ""twist"" of it is easy to guess.

However, visuals and unique origin aside, everything else was found lacking. The movie clocks in at about two hours-ish long, yet Belle does not get to the castle nor meet the Beast until the forty minute mark, and from there, there is little to no development of their relationship nor the character of the Beast, who is an incredibly unsympathetic character and remains as such throughout the entirety of the movie, leading to question how Belle falls in love with him for any reason other than that is what is supposed to happen in the tale of Beauty and the Beast.

Perhaps there is something that has been lost between the original French and the English translation, but the dialogue between Beast and Belle does nothing to support a budding relationship before Belle tells him she loves him. The other characters are 2-dimensional and are unnecessary fodder in the limited run time that could've been used to develop the main relationship of this story, leading to the main narrative being weak and lacklustre. Overall, a disappointing story wrapped in a pretty aesthetic.",1490572800,2,1557,4.849624060150376

6878700,4,B00QSO7VD6,"If you're checking this out, you've probably seen the costumes. Are they beautiful? Yes. They are works of art.

Also, the acting is solid and the scenery is fantastic. The movie looks like something out of a fantastic dream.

I suspect everyone is familiar with the story - no major changes there.

Probably my biggest gripe was that it never entirely made sense to me as to why Belle and the Beast got together. (There was no chemistry and it just went from ""I hate him"" to ""LOVE"" super fast.) But then, this seems to be a problem with a lot of Beauty and the Beast retellings, so I won't fault it overly, especially as I have NEVER before seen a more gorgeous movie.",1489708800,,669,4.379032258064516

6878704,4,B00QSO7VD6,"Beautiful costumes, scenery, effects...I felt too much time was spent on Belles family throughout the movie and not enough time on Belle and Beast's relationship. There is no reason for Belle to fall in love with him. I loved the Beast's unique backstory on how he came to be a beast.
I was worried about reading all of the subtitles, but there really wasn't that much dialog in the movie.

6878706,5,B00QSO7VD6,"Ok so I just watched this movie and all I can say is--wow. I loved Disney's Beauty and the Beast, but this ties and perhaps even surpasses that version.  The visuals are eye-popping, costumes spectacular, script  is beautifully written, excellent cinematography. It's a feast for the eyes, the mind, and the heart.

5/5 stars, an A+, a must buy to any fan of classic movies generally.",1482537600,,384,4.787878787878788

6878708,4,B00QSO7VD6,"Ever since the 1700s, ""La Belle et La Bete"" has been an enduring and beloved fairy tale, inspiring countless books, movies, television shows, a ballet and an opera.

So you'd think that nothing new could be squeezed from the tale as old as time. But while Disney constantly cannibalizes and regurgitates their version, French director Christophe Gans released a far more spellbinding film -- a loose reimagining of the version made by the brilliant Jean Cocteau. The story can be rather thin at times, but it does an excellent job adding to the ""Beauty and the Beast"" lore, while spinning up luscious, hauntingly ethereal visuals.

When her widowed father (Andr Dussollier) loses his ships in a storm, Belle is the only member of her family to embrace their new, humbler life in a country cottage, while her siblings lounge around dreaming of the life they've lost. When one of the lost ships makes it back to port, her sisters start demanding new luxuries and dresses, but Belle only wants a rose. And it soon turns out that her dad may have trouble getting that much -- he loses his ship, attracts the attention of the cruel gambler Perducas (Eduardo Noriega), and ends up lost in a snowstorm.

Well, you know what happens -- he ends up taking shelter in a vast, half-crumbled castle overgrown with roses, and full of strange doglike creatures. But this castle is owned by a strange Beast (Vincent Cassel) who isn't pleased when the merchant takes a rose, and gives him just one day to say goodbye to his family.

Feeling that all this is her fault, Belle goes to the castle in her father's place -- and is instead given beautiful gowns, the freedom of the estate, and dinnertime every night with the awkward Beast. As she explores her new home, she also has dreams of a princess who lives there long ago, and the terrible events that led to the Beast's current predicament. But when she briefly visits her home, Belle finds that she may have accidentally brought a terrible threat to the Beast and his home.

""Beauty and the Beast"" appears to be something of a reimagining of Jean Cocteau's classic adaptation of the fairy tale. Not a literal remake, of course. Instead, it takes the symbolism and imagery of Cocteau's story, and reweaves them as new parts of the overall tale -- the deer that the Beast once hunted, the statues, the fluttering curtains, the catlike appearance of the Beast, and many other clever little details. It's reminiscent of Cocteau, but still very creative.

The biggest problem is that the story is a bit on the thin side, and there is never quite a point when we see the Beast win Belle's affections. However, writer/director Gans adds some new storylines and aspects to the story, particularly a more detailed backstory to the Beast's transformation, which Belle sees every night as she dreams, a villain in Perducas, and some menacing stone giants that lurk in the rose overgrowth. All this comes together in the climax, adding some action and rama to the previously dreamlike, haunting film.

But what truly sets this movie apart is the visuals. Every scene is a luscious, magical experience, as if it had been ripped from the pages of a storybook and somehow brought to life. The crumbling castle draped in roses and lit by golden motes, moonlit pools, the firelit banquets, the velvet gowns glittering with jewels, the oasis of misty forests in the heart of a frozen wasteland, the floating flower petals, and a fallen marble statue that gives Belle important hints of what has happened. This movie is a feast for the eyes, and the sheer beauty of it is almost enough to compensate for the thin story.

The one distracting aspect of the visuals is the CGI. It's not abysmal, but it never quite convinces the viewer of what they're seeing, whether it's luminous-eyed dog-creatures or the Beast's oddly masklike face and cartoonish mouth. It all looks slightly artificial.

As for acting, Seydoux gives the rather thin role of Belle some fiery determination, with enough courage to verbally banter and even challenge her beastly suitor despite her fear. Cassel does quite well as a tormented creature who loathes his own cursed existence, and seems to take it out on those around him. Also... the dogs. Yes, they are CGI, but these glowy-eyed, bobble-headed hounds are just the cutest little creatures.

In a time when fairy tale movies are either unoriginal or ""dark and gritty,"" the enchantment of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a welcome treat -- and its sheer visual beauty should be seen, if nothing else.",1482192000,,4539,4.792838874680307

6878711,3,B00QSO7VD6,"The visuals are nice, but the story did not invoke any sort of emotion.  All I could think was ""another pretty dress.""  It felt too focused on making the movie pretty than providing good story telling.  I had high hopes for this because of the movie trailer, but you could watch the trailer and feel more emotion than if you were to watch the movie itself.

There is no character development.  No relationship development either.",1480982400,,429,4.666666666666667

6878713,5,B00QSO7VD6,"WOW! Fantastic movie! I was worried it might be a bit campy because it's not a Hollywood film, but it's not at all! It's high-budget and extremely well done.

Early on, the storyline sticks very close to the original fairytale and then at the end it -- almost seamlessly -- kind of does it's own thing and it was masterfully pulled off. Not only did I enjoy this on its own merits AND as an adaptation, but it also made me even more excited for the upcoming Disney film -- because it'll be great if it's even HALF as good as this one was.

Much better than the Faerie Tale Theatre version and MORE than on par with the 90s Disney one.

Because I was confused as to if/how this would play on a region one player, since it's French, I will put in this review that this WILL play on your American player most likely. It plays both on my stepdad's playstation and on my mini-player, so it's standard format. You will have to fast forward past some dumb commercials before you reach the main menu, but it's not too bad and it's worth it.

The seller did a great job. Item was in good shape, came when expected, and I enjoyed it immensely.",1480377600,3,1133,4.255813953488372

6878715,5,B00QSO7VD6,"I had the unique opportunity to see this photoplay in the cinema last week (luckily, it was playing only in the one close to where I live; I wanted to see it ever since I heard about it two years ago, and it seemed like it would never be released here in the United States) and it was amazing. I was the only person in the cinema house where it was playing until the movie began, and about a minute into the film, a father and daughter came in, but left after around two minutes. (I guess they were expecting the upcoming live-action Disney version). Anyway, the film is closer to the original French faerie tale than the Disney animated classic, which is my all-time favourite photoplay, with a few minor differences. The acting is wonderful, and the visuals are absolutely engrossing from beginning to end. The story, is of course, Beauty-ful, and grabs your attention from the beginning, never letting go until the final frame fades out during the credits. The 1946 version directed by Jean Cocteau is also definitely worth seeing, and a welcome companion film to see alongside this masterpiece. Definitely worth adding to your DVD collection.

Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.",1477008000,,1191,4.725961538461538

6878725,2,B00QSO7VD6,"Visually, this movie is gorgeous, from the actors to the sets and costumes.  Odd but pleasant supernatural quirks run through the film.  However, the storyline was incredibly weak, and not even the decent acting could move me past the glaring fact that there was no believable reason presented why belle should care about the beast at all, let alone love him.  There was nothing endearing about his personality and his 'beastly' characterization was only ever softened in moments when he was bound to get something out of being nice to belle.  There was no love present in the portrayals of belle or the beast, which in any other movie would have been fine with me but is a glaring omission in a story that's supposed to be a lesson In the nature of love.

When I finally received it and watched it; oh my goodness!  I don't know where to begin.  This version of Beauty and the Beast was so intriguing, beautiful and captivating that I didn't want it to end!  The storyline is so interesting and when it was finally revealed about how the beast ended up the way he was I was shocked and by the end of the film I sat back, a big grin on my face.  Seriously if you enjoy fantasy movies You should get this it's defiantly worth buying. Also someone mentioned there is a small scene of nudity, they were right it's very small and the dubbed English is very easy to read while watching (my sisters don't watch foreign films and they were worried about that but they had an easy time following).  So there are no excuses, get the movie!",1459987200,12,1116,4.280952380952381
6878749,5,B00QSO7VD6,"This was such a good version of the story.  I'm bummed I couldn't find a US release of the Blu-ray but the DVD will suffice until I can remedy that.

It was beautifully done and worth re-watching again~!",1459641600,,203,4.315789473684211

6878751,5,B00QSO7VD6,"Loved this version of Beauty and the Beast. It was so beautiful and an interesting story change. I have watched many versions over the years and this one has reached high on my list of favorites!!!! If you are obsessed with the story as am I, this a must watch!!! I'm glad I added this to my collection!!! It worked on my regular DVD player with the English subtitles!!!! Enjoy it, I did and will continue to!!!",1458432000,2,411,4.35064935064935
6878752,5,B00QSO7VD6,"So glad they released the English subtitle version. Beautiful story, but at times the graphics were off. The CGI wasn't enough to take away from the over all film. I would recommend this movie for fairytale lovers",1457568000,,213,4.783783783783784
6878753,5,B00QSO7VD6,Bought this movie as a gift. Perfect.,1457481600,,37,4.428571428571429
6878754,3,B00QSO7VD6,"This movie as far as I know is fairly close to the French story by Jeanne Marie - LePrince de Beaumont. This is not the Disney version in any way, shape, or form. It was slightly below expectation for me. For those who care to know thought although it is a foreign film it plays an American DVD Players. The spoken language is French, but includes English subtitles. The subtitles are fairly small so i would recommend to be near the screen if possible, unless you happen to be fluent in French.",1457308800,3,495,4.391304347826087
6878755,5,B00QSO7VD6,I love when the dvd have the english subittles while the spoken language is french. It is interesting to see different view of this story on Beast and the Beauty. Different characters and villians.,1457222400,,197,4.823529411764706

6878759,5,B00QSO7VD6,I watched this movie some where and absolutely loved this take on beautie and the beast. That would had to get this movie. I was worried it wouldn't play on my did player. But it worked and I'mvery happy I got it.,1454457600,,213,4.095238095238095
6878760,5,B00QSO7VD6,Loved the movie.  I was glad to find a dvd that played on US dvd players even though it was in french it is a beautiful movie.,1452902400,,126,3.6666666666666665
6878761,5,B00QSO7VD6,We loved this movie we are true romantics great for any Romantic can't go wrong with this one,1451001600,,93,4.222222222222222
6878762,1,B00QSO7VD6,"Gawd, I don't know what to do to scrub my brain from the stupidity. Worried there might be lasting effects Lol. In the span of three days, the beast threatens to kill her family, and her, and himself, and screams at her, and tells her what to eat and what to wear, and physically attacks her, and she somehow falls in love with him (not to mention he ""accidently"" killed his first wife when he completely purposefully lied to her and broke his promise). I'm a French teacher and I think it would be morally irresponsible to show this movie. Not to mention I started playing on my phone when the grass stood up in the form of a man and started attacking the invaders. Cheesiest thing ever. New respect for Lumiere and Mrs Potts. Bleh!!!!",1448496000,2,736,4.419117647058823
6878763,3,B00QSO7VD6,"No real tension. Beautiful done but not the real underlying story or moral. Great actors but under utilized. Fair. More concern with the graphics. CGI does not always tell the story.
 Did not meet expectations.",1448236800,2,210,5.0
6878764,5,B00QSO7VD6,Watched the movie in Middle School French class.  Very lovely filming & simple dialogue.,1446681600,,88,5.285714285714286
6878765,4,B00QSO7VD6,I had trouble reading the English subtitles.  The text seemed small.  I do not have a High Definition TV and I don't know if that had anything to do with it.  At times I would have to back up the movie to try to re-read the subtitles.,1441670400,2,234,3.9361702127659575
6878766,4,B00QSO7VD6,I mostly enjoyed this movie...it was beautiful to watch.,1440460800,,56,5.333333333333333
6878767,5,B00QSO7VD6,I normally don't write reviews but I had to write one for this. I have loved to story of Beauty and the Beast since I was a little girl and the Disney version is my all time favorite movie. I enjoy different telling of the story and this version was absolutely stunning!! I ordered it by mistake but it was the best mistake I have made. It was just a beautifully made film that stayed true to the original fairy tale but added it's own spin on things. I could not recommend this movie enough to anyone who enjoys this story or appreciates beauty. I could watch this movie over and over again!,1440460800,12,592,4.247787610619469
6878768,5,B00QSO7VD6,"Sure, this movie could have used a liiiittle more in the way of the story, but the stunning visuals (scenery, sets, COSTUMES) MORE than make up for that short-coming. The lead actress is absolutely lovely, and I thought the CGI on the Beast's face was very nicely done. I was absolutely thrilled to finally find this version (Region 1, English subtitles) for my movie collection.",1439164800,4,379,4.846153846153846
6878769,5,B00QSO7VD6,Beautifully filmed movie.  Just gorgeous.  Love all the costumes & scenes.  Great re-telling of this classic tale.,1438387200,,114,5.588235294117647
6878770,5,B00QSO7VD6,"Love it. While growing up, my French teacher loaned me her French copy of beauty and the beast. To this day, without hesitation, I know all the songs in French. I fail trying to sing it in English. Great songs, great memories. :)",1438128000,,229,4.348837209302325

8692701,5,B00QSO7VD6,"If you're planning to get this movie its amazing in French as well as in the English Dub! The voice for the English Dub over are the original actors themselves. Vincent Cassel, La Seydoux etc. Which makes it just as good as the original French. Excellent rendition of this famous fairytale!",1524355200,,290,4.705882352941177

8692705,1,B00QSO7VD6,"Thankfully Netflix has this movie on their list because while the disk plays, all I get is ~10 previews and no feature. SO NOT worth $35 for something that won't play.

Too bad too, because it's a beautiful film and retelling of the story",1512000000,,238,4.409090909090909
8692706,2,B00QSO7VD6,This version was not an improvement on the original and was not nearly as good as the Disney version.  The huge monster statute coming out of the ground was bizarre and the beast had no personality and chemistry with beauty.,1510099200,,224,4.6
8692707,5,B00QSO7VD6,Excellent new version of an old story.,1504915200,,38,4.571428571428571

8692709,5,B00QSO7VD6,"This film is close to the original story, which was French, with some twists. The costumes are gorgeous as are the sets used. English subtitles do not disrupt the story.  It's a lovely retelling.",1502323200,,195,4.735294117647059
