4982809,5,B006BZ8NFC,"The reason why I Love her DVD are: The Movemaster to help you do the moves correctly, makes it that much easier to follow. Always fun choreography. Her instructions and cuing is just brilliant!! She's got a pleasant personality. Highly recommend her videos.",1391731200,,257,5.0
4982810,5,B006BZ8NFC,Love that girl. I have many of her DVD's and keep recycling through them.  She is my go to for a good at-home workout.,1387411200,,118,3.9166666666666665
4982811,5,B006BZ8NFC,if you workout with steps than you will really really love this one...she's so good.  I like her music.  shipping was fast,1363132800,,122,4.5
4982812,5,B006BZ8NFC,"Christi Taylor is currently my favorite Step instructor, just a shade ahead of Gin Miller. Their styles are different, but I enjoy them both.

Over the past ten years I've tried quite a few step DVDs. There are a few things I look for:
- Good music.
  This is important to keep the motivation going. You'll be listening to it quite a few times during the life of the DVD. It needs to be catchy.
- Good cueing.
  This is especially important early on. However, too much gets annoying once you are familiar with the moves. The balance should be right. What I'd really like to see is a DVD that offers the option to turn the cueing off so I can just enjoy the music.
- Interesting moves, with modifiers.
  I like moves that are challenging but not too fiddly. Also, modifiers should be provided to allow me to build up. I train on carpet, so too many turns can be a problem.
- Personality.
  Cardio leaders should be motivating and make me want to join them in the exercise routine.

Christi Taylor: Totally Cool Step 2 scores the following for me--
- Music 4/5 (good, but not quite as good as Totally Cool Step 1 with that *very* catchy Michael Jackson track)
- Cueing 5/5
- Moves, with modifiers 5/5
- Personality 5/5
- Total 4.75/5 - Highly recommended. The moves can be difficult, but well worth the effort.",1353888000,9,1308,4.390041493775934
4982813,5,B006BZ8NFC,The usual great Christi Taylor exercise DVD.  Am sorry she is not making as many DVD's as she used to.  I don't get bored with her DVD's even though I have all of them.,1338163200,5,168,3.911764705882353
4982814,1,B006BZ8NFC,I was looking for a good step video.  She changes too much and you spend more time figuring out the moves and less time loosing weight.,1337558400,,135,4.1923076923076925
4982815,5,B006BZ8NFC,"I've been waiting for a new  Christi DVD and this one doesn't disappoint . Fantastic cueing, non-intrusive music, great production quality.  The BEST part of the DVD is the choreography! This is the most creative and innovative step DVD I own --and I own over 100 fitness DVD's 25 being step.
(I teach step in a local club and Christie is my favorite DVD instructor. )
Of course the DVD follows a recommended warm-up and cool-down. I appreciate the time Christie takes to make sure we have muscular balance ....I have a few that I can't do because they teach fitness like dance class--working the right side over and over to exhaustion.  Anyway, if you are an intermediate to advanced stepper, you WILL want this in your collection...the routine is a blast!  Off beat rhythms, turns, double-kicks--it's all in there and lots more .",1332720000,19,831,4.75
4982816,5,B006BZ8NFC,Another awesome workout with Christi. This workout is so much fun! I like how fast paced it is and how it is loaded with fun choreography!,1332201600,2,138,4.346153846153846
4982817,3,B006BZ8NFC,"I received this video a few days ago.  Please know that this review has nothing to do with the exercise.  It may be a great exercise video but I haven't been able to do the video longer than 5-10 minutes.  When she turns and you see the rear view there is this white on black stitching that is extremely distracting.  The stitching is in the front (vaginal) area and the rear (butt) area.  I don't usually care what the fashion choices are in a video but the I'm thinking 'yuck' the entire time.  I know my words sounds prudish (which I am not) but it's just my opinion.  Hopefully, everyone else won't be so distracted that they can follow along with what is possible a good exercise video.",1328486400,3,691,4.3515625
8496244,5,B006BZ8NFC,"I love all things Christi but this one isn't one of my favorites. It is both mentally and physically challenging, but not one of the more fun ones. The music is upbeat and I love the MoveMaster.",1469750400,,194,4.27027027027027
8496245,5,B006BZ8NFC,"Still one of my favorite step workouts after 3 yrs, I've learned all the steps and now incorporate it what ever music is playing",1454976000,,128,4.375
8496246,4,B006BZ8NFC,"Just tried this work out for the first time this morning.  Although I have been stepping for 30 years, this is an incredibly difficult routine.  Christi has included a breakdown of the moves, which will help a lot, however, it will take several attempts to get the steps down before I will be able to do it.  That being said, I was looking for a work out that isn't too simple and ends up being boring...don't have that worry here!  I have one suggestion.  When you have 4 supporting steppers, two following Christi and 2 modifying, it would be nice to have one of the front girls modifying as having them both on the back row makes it difficult to see what they are doing.  Other than that, I would probably purchase again.",1453680000,,724,4.406015037593985
8496247,1,B006BZ8NFC,"Definitely not for beginners. I have taken step before, but could not follow the moves in this video. Even with the moves assist, I was still lost.  It was a total waste of money.",1448236800,,179,4.264705882352941
8496248,5,B006BZ8NFC,Excellent workout ...  Excellent service,1433376000,,40,7.0
8496249,1,B006BZ8NFC,To hard to follow don't like the instruction,1420416000,,44,4.625
8496250,3,B006BZ8NFC,"I want to love it, as I love one of her other videos, but it is so hard to follow.  I am determined to try again.",1407715200,,113,3.3461538461538463
8496251,4,B006BZ8NFC,"I have other Christi Taylor workouts and I like her style and cuing very much.  She uses complicated steps that keep my mind so occupied that I don't have time to think about how much I'm sweating.  With that said, this workout has especially challenging footwork!  I've had the DVD for about 6 weeks, and while I don't do the same workout every day, I've been doing this workout about 2x/week and I still don't have all the steps down.  I don't mind that challenge, but you should be aware that this particular workout- even with her great cuing- is confusing!",1406937600,,561,4.524752475247524
8496252,5,B006BZ8NFC,Yet another great routine.  I never get tired of doing her step routines.  They are fun with different degrees of challenges. I always know I have worked hard when finished.,1401667200,,173,4.733333333333333
8496253,2,B006BZ8NFC,"as a former step instructor I would not recommend this to anyone unless they really like spins turns and more turns...Christi is a great instructor and she has the modifiers( hint to Christi; maybe put a modifier in the front so they can be seen) Every instructor has their own style of step but I find that this has way to many  turns over, off and beyond the step  and personally I see no reason for them except she likes to do them...very easy to hurt yourself if you are not a very advanced stepper....and even if your advanced be careful I have seen many students hurt them selves over the years doing moves that are complicated and fast and that turn you away from the instructor while doing them........I was really not happy with this DVD and I have done it several times.",1393459200,6,780,4.409722222222222
