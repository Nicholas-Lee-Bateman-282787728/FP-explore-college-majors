447785,4,6302263921,This is a character driven film that relies on the excellent performances of its diverse cast. Chisu Ryu is an absolute marvel to behold. No matter what adversities come his way he always manages to keep a sly half grin on his face as if to show that he is unbreakable despite the problems that he encounters. This is character acting at his very finest and all the characters are wonderful.,1223510400,4,391,4.52112676056338

447787,5,6302263921,"This was Yasujiro Ozu's final film.  Is it phenomenally different than other Ozu works?  Is it a film that takes Ozu in a radically different direction?  No.  It's just the final chapter in one of the most unique filmographies in cinema history.  It's like all his other films, in that it's contemplative, beautiful, moving, serene, and simple, yet, it feels new and unique.  Ozu's films, if taken all together, are like a long novel, all leading up to this one, which ended up being the final chapter (even though Ozu did not intend it to be that way).  Many say that a filmmaker just keeps remaking the same film all his/her life, and with Ozu that may be true.  A friend of mine criticised his aesthetic because of this, but whenever I watch a film of his, I feel so alive and peaceful.  Ozu's plots are often the same with minor variations, yet, I am watching a great artist paint another portrait in film, and I don't feel that Ozu is repeating himself at all.  Despite the differences between the films, the films all feel unique and gentle.  They are filled with a deep humanism, and they are all knowing and filled with that eternal longing.

This film has a deeper sadness that Ozu's other work.  It also has some very funny comedy, and may I say, even a bit dark for an Ozu film.  There is also some bitterness to the characters, a little more tart than other Ozu films, but also that deep humanism as well.  There are some really moving scenes here, especially when we see the daughter in her wedding gown, and the final shot of the film (and the final shot of Ozu's career) where Chishu Ryu sits down in a darkened kitchen, alone.

The transfer of the film is a little grainy at times (probably due to the source material), but the film is still very watchable.  There are 2 trailers (and they feature Ozu himself directing the film), a fascinating excerpt from a French TV show about cinema (with Michel Clement, the famous film critic), and commentary (which is your standard, film professor type boredom).

The original title of this film was The Taste of an Autumn Mackerel, which doesn't really translate well into English.  The American title is An Autumn Afternoon, and it's a much better title for the film.  It's a great, wonderful film, a worthy final chapter to one of the greatest, most unique directors in cinema history.",1215043200,17,2346,4.5669856459330145
447788,5,6302263921,"This film deals with a simple concern : the feelings between the human beings . Ozu focuses his poetic eye in the increasingly Americanized postwar Tokyo . His unique style with the fixed camera at the kneel height is wonderful but it turns excessively steady and can result unbearable .

Nevertheless he created a vivid and poignant portrait about a father giving up his only daughter in marriage . Haunting , humorous and disturbing . This was the Op. 53 and the last one film of this giant japanese film maker.",1103587200,2,513,4.637362637362638
447789,5,6302263921,"This film is so painfully beautiful, as Ozu's sad farewell (he died of cancer), that I found it hard to believe that New Yorker, who owns exclusive rights to so many of Ozu's films, found it necessary to cut it by  almost twenty minutes.  The Japanese-release version of An Autumn Afternoon  is listed at 133 minutes.  In Japan, the video, from Shochiku Video, sells  for about $30.  New Yorker retails for about twice the price, in a  bowdlerized version.  Save your money for future releases.",963446400,14,494,4.729411764705882
447790,5,6302263921,"Ozu's final masterpiece is a such a wonderful way to end one of the most distinguished careers in filmmaking. Chisu Ryu is once again superb as a lonely widower trying to grapple with giving away his only daughter in  marriage. Although the film runs the gamut of familiar Ozu themes, you  never ever tire of the Ozu trick of a ""good two hours spent with your  neighbors"". His beauty of filmmaking, which is drenched in simple joys  of everyday living makes him one of the greatest humanists of world cinema,  along with Ray and Renoir. Put simply, this film is ""stunning visual  poetry"". This is an absolute ""must have"" for all you Ozu  fans out there, and recommended for all lovers of world cinema.",945216000,35,701,4.604838709677419
447831,4,6302263921,"Had this recommended by a critic who had written about this film being shown at the closing ceremony of this year's Canne's Film Festival, so I ordered a copy.

447832,4,6302263921,"though director ozu was not aware of the fact that this would be his last film, 'autumn' seems, on the surface, the same subject, same characters and same circumstances as his other works, though there is a slight change.  ozu does not imbrue this film with the same overwhelming sense of doom and resignation that pervade his other films.  no reference is made to an 'autumn afternoon' but the film is saturated with wood-grain browns and tans, subdued lighting and easy movement within the frame that arouses the lethargic feel of an autumn day.  the translation of the title is actually 'a taste of mackerel,' which, like 'barley harvest' for 'early summer' and 'flavor of green tea over rice' no doubt conveyed to Japanese audiences the specific tastes and smells of the seasons.  after 40 years of enjoying and appreciating this director's work, i can still recall the 'taste and smell' of a Japan i visited back in 1968. now that i am in my mid-sixties, these films have even more meaning to me.  thanks to criterion for serving up these delicious films.",1383609600,,1060,4.770491803278689
447833,3,6302263921,"Ozu's ""An Autumn Afternoon"" seems to repeat the story line of his film ""Late Spring"", as if there is nothing of more interest to tell than bourgeois widowers with daughters reluctant to marry.  There is heavy drinking among nosy and somewhat snarky friends, set against a grim industrial background and cheerful, oddly incongruous music that would seem more at home in a Fellini film.  Shots of empty rooms and hallways serve as segues between scenes.  It all reminded me of a rather dull and humorless episode of Father Knows Best.

About halfway through this film, a character in a bar remarks, ""Just think.......if we had won the war, we would be sitting in New York City right now!""  This jolted me into the realization that this mild and harmless film should be put in the historical context of ""post-war"" Japan.  So I will grant the mundanity may be its statement.  The Japanese of samarai legend and incomparably exquisite arts seem exhausted by war and modernism at the time of this film, yet the comforts of family, sentiments, traditions and small sorrows, endure.  There is certainly sociological significance to this film as a study of post-war life, but I don't know that I would call it ""poetic.""",1354060800,5,1210,4.839805825242719
447834,5,6302263921,"Ozu is, in my opinion, Japan's greatest filmmaker, despite the fruitful fame of Kurosawa.  And one is hard pressed to name his second best film, after the masterpiece ""Tokyo Story"".  It could be ""Early Summer"", ""Late Spring"", or this structurally perfect film:  An Autumn Afternoon.

There are several levels of the zenith of the cinematic arts represented here.  First of all the visual aspect featuring amazing uses of the color red and his consummate organization of each scene in terms of blocking and actor movement through the assigned spaces.  But even more so, the craft of his asking his actors not to ""act"" creates the most gorgeous and moving poignancy of any movie I know of.  So here one finds perfection of both structure and substance.
It is another Ozu masterpiece.  Highly recommended.",1351987200,,802,4.977443609022556
447835,4,6302263921,"The success of this blend of the high and the low owes almost all to the marvelous screenplays Ozu scripted with his co-writer, Kogo Noda. The cinematography by Yuharu Atsuta is unobtrusive as ever, in the ozu style. And equally backgrounded are the musical interludes of Kojun Saito. The DVD is soon to be released by The Criterion Collection, and while it is comparatively light on extra features- vis--vis other Criterion releases, as well as others of Ozu by Criterion, there is a good deal of quality in the extras. There is the requisite theatrical trailer, and booklet essays by film critic Geoff Andrew and ubiquitous Japanese film scholar Donald Ritchie. I would have expected Ritchie to provide the audio film commentary track, but, instead, that task is assigned to another Japanese film scholar, David Bordwell. Bordwell has always been hit and miss as a film critic, and his few audio commentaries reflect that fact. But, this time he's pretty good, albeit not as natural as Ritchie- a veteran DVD commenter- is. Bordwell is solid, not too didactic, specific to scenes, but a little stiff. He never conveys that he's stuck to his script, but he never really loosens up and gives the percipient the sense that he really is into the total film experience, either. As stated, good, but not great. Perhaps the best point he makes- and it is one I echo, is that Ozu is not a director concerned with character motivations. He is, in essence, the Method Actor's nightmare. Instead, Ozu is a maven of Behaviorist Cinema. What his characters do is more important than what they think or voice. This is why we often get deliberate shots of his characters (In this and other films) from behind. Ozu wants the viewer to imagine what they are feeling, from the situation presented, not from how many tears they shed, nor how wide their smile. Finally, there are selections from Yasujiro Ozu And The Taste of Sake, a 1978 French television show looking examining Ozu's career, and featuring French film critics Michel Ciment and Georges Perec. On the negative side is the fact that Criterions bland, white subtitles are often lost onscreen, in brighter scenes- a problem that is not as bad as in black and white films, but when will Criterion get a clue- colored subtitles, and ones with borders, are a must; especially sans an English language dubbed track. The film is shown in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio.

  An Autumn Afternoon is a great film, but it is not a great film that is garish in its depth and breadth. It does not tackle grand themes, nor does it blow the viewer away with magnificent vistas. Instead, it is a small, perfect gem of a film that distills the human essence into less than two hours of experience that moves one to laugh and inhale deeply. And if one does not think that such a feat as that is something, and something great, then one simply does not understand art.",1339027200,,2887,4.712871287128713
447836,5,6302263921,"Ozu is one of the greatest and most stubborn directors in my opinion (and in most film critics' opinions). This is one of my favorite films of his.

First about Yasujiro Ozu: Ozu does not move the camera. EVER. It sits 6 to 12 inches from the ground, as if the viewer were sitting on a tatami mat as a casual and silent observer. His actors rehearse constantly and rapidly so that all major emotion is taken out of their scene and they act their scenes as if robotic and emotionless. His underlying themes, messages, and meanings are left for the viewer to fathom. Ozu was pretty set in his ways... he didn't make a color film until the studio forced him, and it was much later than most other Japanese directors. He also clung to silent films well after 'talkies' were out.

This film is rather quiet and introspective (as many of his films are).  The film dwells more on capitalism and romance in the new Japan than other films.  There is also an element of fond remembrance for the 'good ol days'.  It is Ozu's sadly poignant acceptance of the rebirth of New Japan.

I am often touched by the films of Ozu, but this is surely one of the most heartwarming and sincere films he has ever directed.  It is my #1 Ozu film and one of my favorite films of all time.",1292371200,,1261,4.317796610169491
447837,5,6302263921,"I love almost all of Yasujiro Ozu's films -- but I love his work best when it's sly and witty, and avoids obvious moralizing. ""An Autumn Afternoon"" possesses wit in spades, and occupies a moral gray area, so it's my favorite of Ozu's many masterpieces. It is also possibly my favorite film, period.

Oh, and it's a hard film to review as well. The plot is episodic ""slice-of-life"" stuff that defies summarizing. Also, the narrative focus shifts between many characters, whose interpersonal conflicts are seemingly tame (an extensive subplot involves a couple arguing about whether they can afford to buy golf clubs) yet very compelling. In short, Ozu's storytelling is miles apart from frenetic Hollywood storytelling, or indeed the more conventional storytelling in most other Japanese films.

But the film does have an ""anchor"" in the father figure played by Chishu Ryu, a sensitive and marvelous actor who manages to convey powerful emotions without looking like he's trying. His character is the central figure who interacts with all of the other characters: the squabbling couple; a retired teacher who is afflicted with loneliness; a pompous professor who can't stop bragging about his young wife; and so on. Ozu's treatment of these characters is sometimes a touch satirical, but always compassionate. Unlike so many other directors, he doesn't lazily criticize the ""middle class"" or assume a condescending attitude to ordinary people; instead, he treats these people, and their daily struggles, with respect.

Ozu also demonstrates a strong sense of humor in this film, which distinguishes ""An Autumn Afternoon"" from grimmer (and less entertaining) family dramas. People sometimes forget that Ozu directed a lot of comedies in his early days -- possibly because his most famous works (Tokyo Story, Late Spring) are not particularly funny. But his sense of humor returned with a vengeance for this film, which features some great one-liners, practical jokes played by various characters, and even some sly references to the 1960s Japanese equivalent of Viagra.

In short, ""An Autumn Afternoon"" is sensitive, amusing, and profound. I can think of no other film that's similarly plotted, acted, scripted, or shot; this film is uniquely Ozu, and uniquely awesome.

On the other hand, the Criterion Collection's DVD is only *mostly awesome.* The quality of the print is pretty good, and the commentary is excellent as always. But there aren't too many special features, beyond a short and rather pompous segment of a French television show. For meatier special features on Ozu, check out previous Criterion realizes such as ""Tokyo Story,"" which features an excellent documentary on the director's life and work.",1284940800,,2714,5.273148148148148
447838,5,6302263921,"Recently made available on DVD.  Yasujiro Ozu's final masterpiece.  A true classic
film.  Ozu is known for his 50mm lens used on all his movies, shot at low angle, and
yet the world is just starting to discover his work. All his movies from after the
pacific war focuses on middle class Japanese family. Superb acting and is considered
to be a true genius of story tellers as well.  His stories are simple, and yet very
deep. Take a trip into Yasujiro Ozu's films.  He has touched my heart with all his
wonderful movies.  Autum Afternoon was his last movie completed in 1962 as he passed
away the following year at his prime age of 60.",1249344000,,635,4.431034482758621
447839,5,6302263921,"But in the end this IS the last work of Yasujiro Ozu's life.  I can't say it is a surprise or fresh because he uses the same actors and actresses he loves.  And the plot of a dad trying to get his daughter married off and happy is also recycled - if you are reading this you know this.  While in other films of this type the father in the end seems to be OK with what he did in this one the father seems to be lonely and sad that he has lost one of his children, even when he still has a son at home.  It is the same - with a twist.
Being able to see a movie drama from Japan in color was amazing in itself - the ruins, the play of red and white, the angle of the camera allowing us to almost look up at the characters and down the layered settings, with the foreground and background and everything in between seeming to jump out at you.  The reunion of old friends, the TV set, the fridge, the vacuum cleaner, the tiny plots that twist around the main plot, and the baseball game show the change in Japan in the post-war years.  But the old traditions and ways of the family still hung on.  It makes such a great mixture of new, old and, sometimes, lovely themes that pop out at you.  Get it new or used.",1239062400,2,1206,3.934156378600823
447840,5,6302263921,"The last work from revered filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu is a surprising delight, at once a summation of the family dramas that dominated his postwar career and a celebration of his quiet artistry. It's a movie that doesn't call attention to itself and even goes as far as lifting entire sequences from his previous films. At the same time, this 1962 drama is not so much a re-telling of the same stories (co-written with longtime collaborator Kgo Noda) as it is a re-evaluation of the same dramatic themes that inform the director's work since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Late-Spring/dp/B000EOTWIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Late Spring</a>, his 1949 classic to which this film bears the strongest resemblance. Ozu aficionados will find all his familiar, idiosyncratic touches here - the elliptical narrative, the observational view of the characters from the outside, the thoughtfully composed shots, and the stationary, slightly above-ground camera angles to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat.  Moreover, Ozu liked using the same actors over and over again, so it comes a no surprise that frequent Ozu actor Chishu Ryu stars in the director's valedictory film.

The character-rich plot centers on middle-aged businessman Shuhei Hirayama who lives with his 24-year-old daughter Michiko and younger son Kazuo. In the absence of a mother, Michiko takes care of the wifely responsibilities for her father and brother and hasn't considered marriage in the near term even though Japanese tradition would label her an old maid soon enough. Hirayama's old friend Kawai has an eligible bachelor in mind to connect with Michiko, but her heart belongs to someone else who is unaware of her interest. Hirayama thinks there is no hurry to marry his daughter off until he sees his old middle schoolteacher comically nicknamed ""The Gourd"" by his old classmates. Hirayama and Kawai take the wizened man home in a drunken state after a night of sake and beer. They see that he now owns a run-down noodle shop and lives with his daughter, an aging spinster who reveals hints of her sad fate. As Hirayama forges ahead with his daughter's prospect, his older son Koichi struggles to live within his modest means with a wife who nags him about his spendthrift ways. He needs to borrow money from his father to buy a new refrigerator but wants to buy a set of used MacGregor golf clubs against his wife's objections. The plot threads eventually come together when Michiko does marry leaving Hirayama to share household responsibilities with Kazuo.

What first catches your eye is Ozu's vivid use of color, especially a bold use of red in both defining and transitional shots. The other aspect is tonal as the director has moved from the barely concealed emotionalism of his early works to a certain ruefulness in his last film. The last few minutes cover the exact same dramatic finale of ""Late Spring"", but this time, it doesn't seem nearly as tragic, evoking a slightly melancholic resignation. The stoic Ryu plays the role of the widowed father in both films, this time given an intriguing backstory as an officer in the Imperial Navy during World War II. This leads to my favorite scene at a bar where Hirayama runs into a former sailor under his command (played with boisterous relish by Kurosawa favorite Daisuke Kato) and speculate what Japan would be like had they won the war. Played by Kyko Kishida, the bar hostess will be familiar to art-house connoisseurs for the title role in Hiroshi Teshigahara's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woman-in-the-Dunes/dp/B00003G4JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woman in the Dunes</a>. Another familiar face is Haruko Sugimura (the selfish older daughter in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Story/dp/B00005JLV7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Story</a>) whose cameo as the schoolteacher's spinster daughter is heartbreaking.

Tora!</a>) cuts an effectively pitiable figure as her father.

Shima Iwashita plays Michiko with snippy plaintiveness, effective enough but a far cry from the luminous Setsuko Hara in the earlier film (her reassuring presence is missed here). Keiji Sada (who sadly died in a car crash soon after this film was made) and Mariko Okada etch a revealing postwar portrait of a young Japanese couple struggling to make ends meet in their small apartment. Compared to previous Ozu classics released by the Criterion Collection, the extras on this 2008 release are sparse and limited to one disc. First, there is a highly informative commentary track by author David Bordwell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ozu-and-the-Poetics-of-Cinema/dp/0691008221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ozu and the Poetics of Cinema</a>). The second is a fifteen-minute excerpt from a 1978 French TV special, ""Yasujiro Ozu and The Taste of Saki"" just as France was discovering his work.

The story line (yet again) deals with the conflicts arising from twenty-something, unmarried (and attractive) daughters living with (and focused on caring for) aging widowed fathers (who need to get on with their lives).  To say that Director Yasujiro Ozu was obsessed with variation on this theme would be a vast understatement.  He kept making essentially the same film over and over (trying to get things right or just stuck in a non-creative funk?) with translated titles often including the name of a season.  Sort of like a TV series with one episode per season (pun intended).  But the version presented in this film is the best of the bunch.  The same old story line is significantly punched up with a robust, imaginative script offering a wide variety of plot-related and tangential events (including the game of Go which is rarely--if ever--seen in the ""classical"" Japanese cinema), and often amusing scenes populated by engaging character actors in cameo appearances.  And the pacing is ""brisk,"" at least by this Director's standards.  The film also reflects fascinating aspects of contemporary Japanese life and culture (circa early 1960's).  Many of the same actors and actresses appear in this film as they have in others of the series, but mostly play different roles (as is usually the case).  The male lead actor (Chishu Ryu) turns in another stunning performance.  Same interiors, scenes and sequence of scenes, and even shots and sequence of shots as employed in prior films.  Music is heard during most of the movie, and resembles film scores from the European cinema and, especially, the Italian cinema of the era.  Kimonos look exquisite, even the ""everyday"" ones.  Cinematography (color) and sound are fine.  Visual effects are primitive.  Subtitles are indispensable for helping with the Western dialect used throughout the film.  A keeper.  WILLIAM F.

The usual Criterion transfer -- flawless, authoritative -- and wrapped around with commentary. If you have an interest in well made films from other countries Ozu is one of the best, up there with Jean Renoir, Powell and Pressburger, Fritz Lang, and others. Look for his still camera and his tiny, Austenian subjects. His films are never operatic, always focused on people, closely observed, but there is something about the stillness of the camera that requests a reserved involvement from us that makes the films unique, and uniquely moving stories about the passage of time itself through families and relationships.",1397260800,3,797,4.867647058823529
