2925654,5,B000UUX2QY,"I'm a huge Red Sox fan, but this is a DVD that even a Colorado Rockies fan can enjoy.  The only other World Series DVD I purchased was for the 2004 Red Sox, so my comparison is tied to that DVD.

The biggest difference I've found between the 2007 World Series DVD and the 2004 World Series DVD is that the 2007 DVD is more evenly balanced between Red Sox coverage and Rockies Coverage.  The 2004 World Series DVD spent maybe two or three minutes on the Cardinals whereas the 2007 version spends much more time on the Rockies, the series they won and the players on their team.

There is less 'regular season' footage in the 2007 edition and by less I mean virtually none.  I have to say I enjoyed the 2004 edition where the DVD started from spring training, went thru the trade deadline (Remember Nomar?) and then of course the 'fight' between A-Rod and Varitek.  With all due respect to the 2007 season, I don't think there were as many polarizing events as there were in 2004.

Another difference, which was nicely done, was the change in narrators.  The 2004 DVD was narrated by Dennis Leary, the 2007 DVD was narrated by Matt Damon.  I'm not sure why a switch in narrators was done, but each of these narrators are passionate Red Sox fans.

Overall, I would have prefered to see more Red Sox footage/coverage, but how can you blame MLB for including more Rockies footage after the final six weeks that they had.  For a franchise that is less than 20 years old, the Rockies fans should enjoy this 2007 World Series DVD.",1196640000,7,1522,4.438848920863309
2925655,4,B000UUX2QY,"I purchased this yesterday at my local Mall. I don't know if it was supposed to on the shelves yet but what the heck I bought it. I had a great time reliving another memorable Bosox playoff comeback and some great not seen before footage. The extras were interesting though, the audio was almost muted on most of them and what I was looking forward to seeing again was the final 3 outs of game 4 was edited down to showing the clubhouse as it was prepared for the chamagne celebration then cutting to the long fly ball caught by Ellsbury right to the final 3 pitches of the last batter. Oh well, it was great re-living all of it , enjoy...",1195948800,16,639,4.245901639344262
2925656,5,B000UUX2QY,I bought this as a gift for a family member and he loves it.  He was very pleased with it and he is a die hard Red Sox fan.  He said that the DVD is very well done and has really enjoyed watching it.,1216857600,,199,3.5
2925657,5,B000UUX2QY,"Well, what is this? A Norwegian review of a baseball DVD?!?

Well, I am indeed Norwegian, and I have been a fan of baseball and the Red Sox since I saw Cheers on tv back in the 80's. Later I visited Florida, but before expansion, so I ""only"" saw some spring training there. After that I got me a girlfriend from Denver Colorado, and I became a big fan of the Colorado Rockies, and the city of Denver as well. But I would never replace the Red Sox, so I told myself, ""hey, you live in a country where you never get to see baseball, you're allowed to have two favorite teams, right?"" So I said, ""I'll have a favorite AL team and a favorite NL team"". And that worked pretty good for nearly 10 years. Sure, the Rockies kept testing my patience (I have seen them at Coors Field nearly 20 times without whitnessing a victory!) and the Red Sox would always frustrate you, but then came 2004 and what a joy. In the meantime I lost my one source of baseball on tv again, so last year was the usual, see some games on the computer, read about it on the internet etc. But when the Rockies got their surge, I was so exited!

So exited in fact, that I failed to notice one thing...

They met my other favorite team in the World Series!

I am sad the Rockies didn't go all the way, but all the same, what a season! And what a story! And my dear Red Sox winning it all again, I was so happy... So... Confused!

But all that aside, this DVD is a great retelling of that season, that I largely missed, so for me this is bliss. Now that I have NASN on my broadband cable, I can once again watch baseball as much as I like, but this DVD is something special to me all the same.

I reccomend it, wether you love the Rox, the Sox, ballgames or just like hearing about a thrilling piece and moment of sports history!",1215129600,,1794,4.096866096866097
2925658,4,B000UUX2QY,"As a lifelong Red Sox fan, I can't complain about this DVD. Even though we're stuck with Fox commentary, it is still fun to watch. However, I needed to say something about the Dropkick Murphy's video -- I was so excited when I saw there was something from them on this DVD, however......

Someone in the MLB office needs to view stuff before finalizing their DVDs. I was expecting Shipping Up to Boston or even Tessie (which was filmed in Fenway), oh no, we got State of Massachusetts about a woman who lets her drug addiction get in the way of her children -- who are taken by the state of Massachusetss......great choice folks....great choice.....jajaja",1199145600,,655,4.695652173913044
2925659,5,B000UUX2QY,"The DVD was amazing. It just really takes you through the whole postseason experience the Red Sox had in 2007. Although I myself am a Red Sox fan, I also really enjoyed how much time in the video was spent on celebrating the Rockies historic run. Overall, fantastic DVD!",1199059200,3,270,4.530612244897959
2925660,4,B000UUX2QY,"I'm an unabashed Red Sox fan and love the content of the video. The Bonus features were a letdown - I expected ""better and more"".

I was very turned off by the 4-5 (?) minutes of ads upfront that you can't fast forward thru. That put a damper on the whole video.",1198972800,,262,4.038461538461538
2925661,4,B000UUX2QY,"With the well-noted similarities between the 2004 and 2007 Red Sox seasons (the now-customary season-long battle with the Yankees for divisional supremacy; a cruise through the first round of playoffs, followed by a nail-biter comeback from the cusp of elimination in the second; a four-game WS sweep), it is fitting that the 2007 World Series highlight film closely resembles the layout of that from three years ago. It once again takes the form of a slickly produced anamorphic feature with a glossy cinematic look and a celebrity fan narrator (Matt Damon, pleasant of voice and assured with the text, replacing 2004's drier Dennis Leary). I would prefer a return to the ""nonpartisan"" World Series videos of years past, those which were more actual documentary than bouquet to the fans of the winners. But one must accept the thing that has been done and evaluate how well it has been done. On that level, this is an improvement on the 2004 DVD, which I felt unfairly slighted the St. Louis Cardinals and their stellar season. Its sins were not just of omission, either: it was full of pretentious, overblown imagery (ominous shots of an empty Fenway, then a quick close-up of a player looking as though about to deliver a major policy address, then a longer shot of the same player leaning on his bat, then speeded-up footage of clouds in the sky, then more aerial footage of empty seats...one might be forgiven for wondering if Diane Chambers had produced a sequel to ""Manchild In Beantown""). It also spent a significant amount of time taking us through Boston's spring training and regular season, which would have been welcome had the coverage of the historic ALCS not been so rushed and bungled. I still wonder how anyone could assemble a highlights video of that postseason and not even mention in passing the two crucial reversed calls in Game 6, or Alex Rodriguez's ""slap seen around the world.""

Someone seems to have learned from past mistakes. The current video, as indicated above, follows the 2004 blueprint to a stronger finished product, one that will do the job for anyone wanting a souvenir of this postseason, but not badly enough to shell out for the box set containing the uncut 2007 World Series and the final three Boston/Cleveland ALCS games. The Colorado Rockies and their astounding late-season/postseason surge are respectfully treated, and their manager and selected players are welcome participants in the talking-head segments along with expected Boston luminaries: Francona, Schilling, Lowell, Papelbon, Varitek, Okajima (in Japanese, with interpreter), et al. Manny Ramirez, David Ortiz, and especially staff ace Josh Beckett are much missed, but their on-field heroics are well covered, as are the electrifying series performances of rookies Jacoby Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia. There is also footage I had not seen before: clowning among players in preparation for one of the games (""Now don't say anything stupid, because I'm miked!""); Manny Ramirez exchanging sincere pregame pleasantries and congratulations with one of the Rockies.

The game of baseball has been going through one of its occasional strings of dark days as I write this, with intensified allegations of steroid use calling into question the accomplishments of many players of stature. Those of us who follow stats and standings passionately and endure offseasons impatiently can comfort ourselves with the knowledge that ugly periods for the game (like labor disputes, collusion, cocaine, and gambling scandals) are there to be gotten through, and will be. In truth, the 2007 World Series, like the 2004, had a whiff of anticlimax to it, as often in sweep years following exciting championship series. But it already is getting easier to imagine nostalgia for Autumn 2007 baseball, when Coco Crisp and Royce Clayton puzzled over the protocols of a free taco; A-Rod and his agent had news that just could not wait; George Steinbrenner exercised his usual restraint in publicly ""motivating"" Joe Torre; an overcaffeinated Dane Cook saturated commercial breaks with the gospel of ""Oc-TO-ber!""; Boston thrilled its fans with something remarkable and familiar, and Colorado thrilled its fans with something remarkable and new. The DVD, in a trim and tidy package, captures a little of its moment's flavor for posterity.",1198972800,,4317,5.1657142857142855
2925662,3,B000UUX2QY,"Overall, this is a very enjoyable watch.  You might complain that there are no complete games included but that's not what these highlight reels are about.  To me, that's a whole 'nother product.

  Matt Damon does a pretty good job on the voice-over and the highlights are pretty comprehensive - going back through the play-offs (though a few more minutes on the ALCS might have been nice).  The ""extras"" were good - not great.  My only annoyance was hearing that idiot Glenn Geffner's voice on a couple of calls here and there.

  Now, it doesn't cover the Regular Season like the NESN version will, I'm sure, and the time spent touting the Rockies just before the start of the World Series highlights seemed a tad long to me (but it's a national product and maybe their fans will want to buy it too) but If I had to choose, I'd still pick this dvd over that one titled ""Champions Again"".  I was rather disappointed with the amount of talking heads and NESN personalities (I could do without Tina Cervasio) in their version.  Anyway, most Sox fans will buy both.

  Enjoy.",1198800000,,1074,4.578947368421052
2925663,5,B000UUX2QY,"I've already watched this 3 times!  It is a great way to relive a perfect year, and Matt Damon does a wonderful job narrating with the lovely sounds of the Dropkick Murphys resounding in the background.  Dance on Papelbon & let's do it again next year.  GO SOX!",1198627200,,261,4.395833333333333
2925664,3,B000UUX2QY,"Of course it's always exciting when your team wins, but when the Red Sox won some of those games wholehandedly, there wasn't much drama to this years Series. I do like how they focused a bit more on the opposing team prior to the start of the Series. Usually, there will be a little snip-it about how they got there. This year, they went into pretty good detail (about 5-10 minutes) on how the Rockies made the World Series. While still a Red Sox movie, Rockies fans may appreciate the piece put together for their team.",1198368000,2,520,4.427083333333333
2925665,2,B000UUX2QY,"This is the best MLB produced World Series DVD to date--but with one BIG catch. There is an UNBELIEVAEBLY annoying MLB logo that is in the top right of the video.  And it is there for the ENTIRE VIDEO.  If that doesn't bother you, then you'll love this DVD.

If, however, it drives you CRAZY (like it does me) that a DVD you purchased for $15-20 that has a permanent MLB tag through the ENTIRE video, then you probably won't like this.  I (for one) won't buy another World Series DVD until MLB gets rid of this logo.

BUYER BEWARE!!!",1197504000,,533,4.29

8215027,5,B000UUX2QY,I think the bad reviews are very unwarranted . 0This product is very well-made and rugged now remember this is a airsoft scope and not a regular riflescopes .There's a special way to adjust the zeroing so the clicks are not the way to do it do not be misinformed by the other reviewers. I guess it all depends on what you're explication is you're not getting a $300 Russian scope getting a very nice replica for your SVD/sniper rifle,1441238400,,433,4.425
