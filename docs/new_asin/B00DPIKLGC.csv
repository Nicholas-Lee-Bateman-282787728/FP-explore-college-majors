8595984,5,B00DPIKLGC,"Stunning puppet animation!  What a great deal on a great film.  The colors on the American DVD are washed out, due to the conversion from Agfacolor to Technicolor, but Jiri Trnka's puppet movement is second to none, and worth seeing!  And Boris Karloff's narration is fabulous!  Highly recommended!",1463529600,,298,5.145833333333333
