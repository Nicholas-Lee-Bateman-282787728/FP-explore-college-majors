8354320,5,B000XULOMK,"Patricia Fripp is just outstanding. Her main theme of this seminar is how to speak to be remembered and repeated.  She presents so many practical ideas about how to give your speeches and presentations that edge that will put you ahead of your competition. She's also dynamic and entertaining, so its really a pleasure to watch. I highly recommend this DVD for sales people, lecturers and anyone who wants to make an impact when they are speaking.",1362787200,,447,4.805194805194805
8354321,5,B000XULOMK,"On my shelf are signed copies of both of Patricia's books and also several of her audio tapes. She is a funny, inspiring and utterly charming speaker. Her web page even has presentation clips for your to sample for free!!

If you are not already familiar with the work and craft her little Bruvver Robert, then one should certainly consider 'In the Court of the Crimson King', 'Red', 'Discipline' and 'A Blessing of Tears'.

Merry Christmas to Robert, Toyah, Willyfred and Patricia and to all at amazon.com and amazon.co.uk
