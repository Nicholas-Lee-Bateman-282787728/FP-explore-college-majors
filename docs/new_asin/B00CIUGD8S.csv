5723055,5,B00CIUGD8S,"This DVD, produced in 2012, is a quality production that, while perhaps not giving a lot of new information on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, does give some interesting insights from informed royal watchers like royal biographers and editors.  Much of the footage is exclusive, not shown before. The storyline covers the couple's life together since their marriage, showing brief footage of the wedding day. The viewer sees some of the earlier life of the couple, pre-wedding, but the video does not simply re-hash information that many already know. It is very apparent that the production team wanted to deliver something fresh and current, and they succeeded. It is a pleasant change to see intelligent coverage and commentary on the royal couple, instead of tabloid-style 'yellow' journalism.  This, along with the entertaining footage, makes this DVD well worth buying.  The bonus material, ""By Royal Appointment"", sounded a little dry to me, but was actually a very informative and entertaining added feature.  It gives an insightful look into some of the British companies who provide products or services to the Royal Family, who have received the royal stamp of approval, and who have permission to use the royal coat of arms (of the Queen, Prince Philip, or the Prince of Wales).  It may sound boring by description, but is really entertaining, especially the chimney sweep, who keeps the chimneys of the royal residences ""clean and tidy""!
I'm very glad I purchased this little keepsake, and highly recommend it to anyone interested in the Duke and Duchess, or in monarchy in general.",1375660800,26,1598,5.10727969348659
5723056,5,B00CIUGD8S,Well Will had to be absolutely sure and this couple have proven to themselves even with the passage of time they truly love each other and  Catherine has been excellent in her preparation. It is also very good to see fresh blood coming into the Royals which is necessary. I believe The House of Windsor will change for the times with William. We are already seeing this new freer spirit that comes from his Mother Princess Diana who really was so sad. You could see the pain in her eyes during that interview she gave.,1406246400,3,518,4.4526315789473685

5723058,4,B00CIUGD8S,"I happen to be an anglophile and my mother more so.  We loved this as we have loved almost all the other DVDs, books, etc.  I am glad I am an American but I do love the British.",1399161600,3,177,3.6315789473684212

5723060,4,B00CIUGD8S,some new footage and interesting comments by commentators. a bit more up-to-date than other DVDs. The narration was easy to understand. I have several DVDs of the wedding/William and Kate's first year/the Royal family and this one compares favorably to the others,1383523200,,263,5.285714285714286
5723061,5,B00CIUGD8S,"This is a lovely documentary. Most of the footage is all new, post royal wedding. Definitely will recommend this dvd to my friends.",1382140800,3,131,4.739130434782608
5723062,5,B00CIUGD8S,it was a very interesting read and well written. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the thoughts that England is finally coming into the future,1381276800,,150,4.592592592592593
5723063,2,B00CIUGD8S,"This was disappointing. They put Will & Kate's face on the front, rehashed old news, but the bulk of this product is advertising businesses in England that make things for the queen and prince of wales. As if we're going to now start ordering things from those places. We're from different eras, we have different taste, one of our tastes aren't better than the other they are just different and personal to us. She likes smoky earl grey hot, I like sweetened iced tea southern, it is all a matter of taste. They like their cheeses, I like to mix sharp cheddar and pepper jack and make homemade mac & cheese, they are both viable options to our specific tastes. I'm not going to order cheese or tea or anything else from there. Quite frankly, it sounds like a new way to get money out of what they still call the new world, and I paid for this DVD so that they could advertise to me?
This is also why I hated touring the Coke attraction in Atlanta, GA. It is just 1  hours of them advertising their product to me.",1379548800,4,1013,4.303664921465969

5723065,5,B00CIUGD8S,"This is one of the newer bio's. Mostly recap Kate's & Will's background before, during, & after St. Andrew's. Touches on the wedding & will's military career It mostly covers the 1st year of marriage. No baby mentioned. It was entertaining. I am always looking for something new on them-like everyone else. Came in good condition. Vey reasonably priced. Timely shipping. Good for a Will & Kate fan!",1376092800,9,398,4.867647058823529

8582202,3,B00CIUGD8S,"This is informative, but nothing new to royal devotees. However, some of the commentators are much too kind to Charles. He did NOT make ""a terrible choice"" in Diana. SHE made the mistake, because she was used.",1464393600,2,209,4.675675675675675
8582203,5,B00CIUGD8S,"Prince William!
You entered the university.
You want to be the art critic.
Also I met Catherine, I fell in love.
And it admired all friends.
To geography it was transferred.
I decided university to replace.
But Kate was resolute.
Also I affected as could.
You invited the friends to a weekend.
And on hunting of all I defined.
Kate at once you got to a duck.
And you gave heart to the prince.
I dreamed to fly, the pilot to become.
And to rescue all people.
That heart not simple.
It after all the gold.
The prince Charles so loves organic chemistry.
And eggs he in food stands up.
And refusal full there of pesticides.
Environmental protection, atsid.
Kate in the fourth class wrote the paper.
About the prince Charles there was a report.
And the sun preserving batteries.
Fine, green is more scarlet.
And every time to change clothes.
And tea drinking to try.
And regularly to visit church.
And to the people to light everything.
You prepare a lasagna, a curry.
Certain apartment, eyes in love.
And dances till the morning.
And kisses in the rain, hurrah.
Professors, career.
Family, custom, sport, culture.
Parents and whole sort.
To continue the course of stories, forward.
You are nice parents.
Arts you are judges.
And are in love with the Homeland.
They fly, as eagles.
