8588091,3,6301231430,"I have to say, this is a silly movie. But it is so silly that it is great to watch! I mean, this movie literally has everything. Ninjas, gangsters, car chases, planes crashing helicopters exploding, a kidnapped scientist, Nazis, pygmis, amazons, post-apocalyptic battles - It's crazy. You almost feel like someone took scripts from a dozen different movies, shredded them, and incorrectly pieced them together into one movie.

Still, it actually works, and is enjoyable. I find myself laughing at many parts that probably weren't meant to be laughed at, but what the heck!",1492128000,,572,5.085106382978723
8588092,4,6301231430,Better written than Indiana jones. I got this as part of a sci-fi megapack. This one had Mad Max Mutants-Martial Arts master-Neonazi's-Pygmies and Amazons...And linda who keeps falling out of her clothes practically at random.,1443398400,,226,5.485714285714286
8588093,3,6301231430,"The film starts out and I am thinking I am watching a scene from ""Wheels of Fire."" The year is 2025 and it has been 40 years since the holocaust that has devastated mankind. Matthew (Richard Norton) wants to take the spear of destiny (the tip anyway) and go back in time and prevent the holocaust. I'm still not sure how that works or what happens to the Spear of Destiny in the past when this one suddenly shows up. Are there two spears then? Okay I'm getting too deep on this time paradox thing.

Matthew finds his way back to the past to 1986, before the holocaust happens. Okay if the year is 2025 and the holocaust happened 40 years ago and now it is 1986...Barbie says, ""Arithmetic is hard.""

The spear ends up in the unable hands of former marine Slade (Robert Patrick T-1000 Terminator) who keeps getting his butt kicked and his girlfriend archeologist to be Michelle (Reform School Girl Linda Carol). Together they battle neo-nazis with the aid of a pygmy tribe and an Amazon tribe.

The film has some very bad acting and lines. There is an Ed Wood car chase scene that starts early in the evening when it is dark and ends when it is light out about noonish. High cult/camp value.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or sex. Nudity (Hey! It has Linda Carol in it.)",1351296000,2,1265,4.416309012875536
8588094,5,6301231430,"I admit, I had my doubts about this movie. I mean, 2025? Puuuuh-lease, that is so overdone. But after I was done watching it, my eyes were open. Cirio H. Santiago has turned a small packet of sweet & low into an everlasting gobstopper. And I'm going to keep sucking at this one, until it runs out. Which it won't, because it's everlasting.",1189036800,,339,4.396825396825397
