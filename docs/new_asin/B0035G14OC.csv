4070317,4,B0035G14OC,"Blindfold was one of those films that took advantage of the spy craze started by the James Bond films of the 1960s and perpetuated by television shows like Mission Impossible.  Rock Hudson is very good at playing, well, Rock Hudson, a psychiatrist hired by the government to analyze a VIP tucked away in an unknown location.  Hudson's only clue to the the location are the sounds he hears as he is blindfolded and whisked away.  Things become complicated as enemy agents infiltrate and cause a massive shakeup. Who are the good gus and bad guys? Add Claudia Cardinale who has good chemistry with Hudson, and you have a really good escapist adventure.  Best moment is when Hudson and Cardinale hide in a truck lined with mannequins and they blend in! There is tension and humor with a nice Lalo Schifrin score that borrows liberally from his Mission Impossible riff. Please get the region 1 rights to this on dvd! It is solid entertainment that deserves to be seen.",1296518400,13,964,4.720238095238095

8388990,5,B0035G14OC,Saw this the first time as a kid with the family. Loved the movie story and cast. Hudson's psychiatrist character is kidnapped and must recall where he was taken in order to save a scientist. The idea of him recalling hearing geese is later used in the movie Sneakers. Great movie for the family. Sadly the vault series doesn't seem to have menus or any features. Strictly pop it in and it plays.,1456617600,4,396,4.438356164383562
