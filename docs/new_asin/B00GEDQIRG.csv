Amazingly talented fighter from lightweight to middleweight.
If you also read the ""I Am Duran"" biography - it'll provide an even greater perspective when watching the fights.",1496361600,,266,4.933333333333334

Didnt come in a case but thats okay it was in neat dvd pouches that are all connected together so it keeps his collection in one place. Thank you for also sending an bonus fight.
