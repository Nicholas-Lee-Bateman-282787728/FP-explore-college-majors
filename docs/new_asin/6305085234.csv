Not only was it the first kung fu movie to hit American soil, but where  would Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li be if this movie didn't have such  a breakthrough.  Lo Lieh set this movie off.  I liked the old school  action, other than the pausing punches and kicks that came along in the  mid-seventies.  GET THIS MOVIE!!!",935539200,4,474,4.188888888888889
962396,5,6305085234,"This is indeed the Kung Fu film which started the craze in America before Bruce Lee took the lead.  The film contains outrageous Kung Fu stunts achieved by such tricks as running the film backward or having the actors  jump from off-screen trampolines.  The bad dubbing and worse dialog  provides an unintentional element of hilarity which makes this film  uniquely entertaining for its genre.  My friends and I saw this movie 5  times on its initial American release, laughing until we cried each time,  and dragged everybody to it that would go.  You haven't lived until you've  heard lines like ""he's thick as two planks"", and ""take these  two knives, and I'll see ya later!""",924307200,3,678,4.808695652173913

962813,5,6305085234,"One of the Shaw Brothers Studios most well-known films, King Boxer was an international success that helped instigate the kung fu craze of the '70s. It opens with an old master (Wen Chung Ku) attacked in an alley. He fends off the fighters, but decides he isn't strong enough to travel to a martial arts school to learn the Iron Fist (also called Iron Palm) fighting technique. He sends his pupil and son-in-law Chao Chi-Hao (Lo Lieh) instead. When Chao arrives at the school, he finds the students and teachers in preparation for the All China Tournament. They fear that if their archrivals win the competition they will rule with cruelty. Chao, the clumsy rookie, must start at the lowest rung of the school's ladder and work his way up. Meanwhile Ming Dung Shun (Tin Fung), master of the ""bad"" school has hired Chen Lang (Gam Hei Chu), a tough mercenary, and two Japanese ronins to kill or maim the ""good"" school's best fighters. In one of these fights Chao's hands are broken and it seems as if he will not be able to fight again. Chao redoubles his efforts to overcome his injury and learn the Iron Fist technique. Mastery of the technique is indicated by a ""whooo-hee whooo-hee"" sound effect and a quick zoom to the fighter's glowing hands. Chao's old master is also attacked and killed by these fighters and his daughter/Chao's girlfriend Yin Yin (Ping Wang) flees to tell him the bad news. Chao fights his way to the All China Tournament, and prepares to take on Ming Dung Shun and his cohorts. In the United State, the film is more commonly known as Five Fingers of Death, the more exploitative title given to it by Warner Brothers. ~ Michael Buening, All Movie Guide",1252108800,,1676,4.62751677852349

962817,4,6305085234,"This may have been the first Kung Fu movie I saw. It made a big impression on me at the time. While the martial arts are stagy and the music swiped from American movies and TV (Ironside and Diamonds are Forever) it is a seminal film for it's clever script.

Unlike the hackneyed plots of other such films, this movie throws some real curve balls at you. It also has a delicious villain who is much more clever than we're used to seeing in these movies. Even to this day I find some of the stuff he does disturbing, and I'm pretty jaded at this point. It's all in the nature of his underhanded methods.

The transfer on this DVD isn't that good. But this is an important film in the Kung Fu canon and should not be missed. It's also one of the many influences on Kill Bill 1. Notice the Ironside music and smash zoom close ups in that movie area direct swipe from 5 Fingers of Death.",1164412800,6,882,4.182352941176471
962818,5,6305085234,"I was surprised to see some reviewers give this movie a lukewarm rating--not for the fighting as much as for the movie's plot.  I've seen maybe 12 martial arts fliks--fewer than many reviewers, so maybe I'm a bit green.  But I thought the plot was FASCINATING, and the acting outstanding.  Although the plot features very typical outcomes for the good and the bad guys,  and predictable subplots (like the hero's faithfulness to his first girl back home in the little village in spite of the very hot but proper second girl who tempts him),the magic is in the details--we can guess that A will lead to B, but HOW THIS MOVIE GETS FROM A TO B is VERY WELL CRAFTED.  As for the acting, the hero truly manages to be subtle at the same time that he is passionate.  He shows a nice mix of the old-fashioned vs. the flashy (though still understated) hero.  I loved the clever switch from his playing the role of submissive reserved student who crawls out of the bar after being humiliated by the newly arrived fearsome bad guy one day, to his return the next day to the bar in an oustandingly heroic and funny payback scene.  The women were stereotyped, but managed to play their roles with that sexy Asian girl grace, and with a sweetness that didn't seem overdone.  As for the fighting?  Who am I to say, but my eyes feasted. There was always a nice balance between the fighters so that it wasn't obvious till the very end who would win.  And the transitions from one fighting scene to the next in the last half hour were done so well, and with such surprising plot twists and drama that I was on the edge of my seat!",1160956800,21,1612,4.393939393939394
962819,1,6305085234,The original I saw years ago was a great new film the DVD that I recieved is in very poor focus and has blank spots,1154044800,2,115,3.64
962820,3,6305085234,"""Five Fingers of Death""(original title: ""King Boxer"") is most emphatically NOT the ""greatest martial arts movie of all time"" or whatever it says on the box. It's a fairly typical early 70s Shaw Brothers film that became famous--or infamous--as the first kung-fu flick to be shown in American theaters. There had been many, many films like this before...American audiences just hadn't seen them. Also, some sources list prolific Shaw moviemaker Chang Cheh as the director of ""Five Fingers"". This is incorrect; it was directed by Chang Chang Ho.

So, if ""Five Fingers"" is not, after all, the yardstick by which all other martial arts films are measured, what IS it? It's an enjoyable, corny kung-fu programmer, very much a product of its time. The fights are choreographed in fine old Hong Kong style,

on a par with Bruce Lee's first two movies; they are not sped up and there are no computer effects(which you weren't expecting in the first place, since this was made in 1971...right?). The climactic battle is a little underwhelming for a Shaw film, but it's adequate. The story is your standard, Chinese-good-guys-versus-Japanese-bad-guys fare, but you have to remember that ""Five Fingers"" was one of the first movies to make use of this storyline--even before Bruce's ""The Chinese Connection"".

Above all, you should see it for two reasons: it's one of the few Shaw Brothers films readily available on DVD in the United States(even their average movies were miles ahead of standard Hong Kong fare in terms of martial arts choreography and production values) and it stars Lo Lieh, who passed away three years ago. As the hero, he's holding back just a little here(he was always better in villainous roles), but Lo was one of the true superstars of the genre. Buy ""Five Fingers of Death"" and get to know him.",1113177600,25,1809,4.924590163934426

Lo Lieh learns the Iron Fist technique and whoops some serious ass, avenging the murder of his two masters.

962897,5,6305085234,"The original kung-fu classic Five Fingers of Death is not only the first of its kind but still is the best directed and choreographed kung-fu film to date.
Most kung-fu movies today are all about special effects (Yes...even WITH the kung-fu). Yeah, I've seen it all: Martial Artists flying in the air thinking they can defy gravity. Others punching their foes so hard that they literally fly fifteen feet forward into a brick wall (again defying gravity). But what did Five Fingers of Death have? Trampolines! And that was only for jumping in the air! If it wasn't for that trampoline idea, future kung-fu movies would've never have thought of using other crazy special effects that would make their characters almost look like gods. But to be honest with you, special effects have gone too far in today's kung-fu movies. I say the more realistic it is, the better. Anyway...when it came to the choreographed fight sequences in Five Fingers of Death, you can tell that these martial artists were for real. Not only do you see Chinese fists fly, but Japanese samurai slicing foes! The fight sequences with the sword-wielding samurai were again, very realistic. I may be crazy but I'm pretty sure that the swords(if not all the weapons)in the movie were real. Why? Well if you study carefully at the movie, you notice three things:
1)When our protagonist Chao Hao had to fight the two samurai, they seemed to have swung their swords very sluggishly, as if it were heavy.
2)You would hear very authentic sounds from the steel of the swords whenever they clashed with other bladed weapons.
3)The blades would shine whenever the sun was around.
Well, that pretty much convinced me. Even if the director didn't have real weapons in the movie, then you have to give the guy some credit for making it seem real.
I'm a huge film critic and I must admit, the directing in this film was masterful! You don't believe me? Well, watch the movie again and you'll notice this director has done many camera techniques(even for a low budget film)that only a master director can think of. Here's one example:
*SPOILERS AHEAD!*
When Chao Hao's old and new master dies, you notice that both turn green! Now why does the director do this? Well to be honest I'm not so sure myself, but I think it has something to do with the fact that they were both very close to Hao, and both were very wise. The director somehow wanted them to stand out, ya know, to make you realize that someone innoncent and important to Hao was dying. It could mean that, or it could be that they were just very pale after being tortured to death by that crazy villain. Either way, I thought it was a very interesting idea.
*SPOILERS END!*
I could mention many other cool camera techniques the director has done, but by the time I tell you all this I would ruin your fun with the movie and the review would never end! So I'm going to say one more thing and then I'll be done:
If you're a big fan of kung-fu, then this classic is a must have. Don't overly expect too much from the film, but watch it with an open mind. Remember, it's the first of its kind. The action is excellent, the acting is great, the directing is masterful, and the film is original.",1069632000,3,3206,4.558058925476603
962898,5,6305085234,"I bought the DVD hoping to improve the presentation quality over the letterbox VHS but there seems to be no improvement.  This is a fun film which helped start the Kung Fu craze in the pre-Bruce Lee period, and is quite entertaining despite its creatively dubbed dialog -- lots of outrageous martial arts stunts probably achieved by off-screen trampolines and in one case by running the film backward.  A great romp, spoiled by lackluster color and focus and a grainy, muddy tinge.  Not terrible, but very mediocre DVD technically speaking.

Another cliche duplicated later on: the guy who became the biggest butt kicker in the end was always getting picked on by every bully conceivable, even the other students at his school. Gotta love the glowing red hands, bad acting, and screwy dialogue.

But there are definitely some fine sequences and places where the story takes surprising turns, and any kung fu fan ought to be able to enjoy it, Plus, of course, as a page of history it almost compels viewing anyway.",1465171200,,617,4.327586206896552
