I love Kevin Garnett ever since the day he got drafted right out of High School to the NBA and to start with the Minnesota Timberwolves. This DVD has pretty much the story oh him growing up in South Carolina and then moving to Chicago with his mom Shirley and his sisters Sonya and Ashley Garnett. Plus talks about him going to a legendary team the Boston Celtics and how he won his first championship.
