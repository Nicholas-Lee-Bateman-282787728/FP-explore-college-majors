8396060,1,B003FQT5UW,"I will never order from this vendor again.  The discs were not in proper order.  One episode glitches so much I can't watch it, and another episode is completely missing.  They only gave me 30 days to watch the entire series, and I did not have time to watch it all in the allotted time.  Consequently, I could not return it.

The series itself, is great, and I recommend it to anyone who likes good anime.  Do not, however, by it from this vendor.",1519084800,,448,4.273809523809524
8396061,1,B003FQT5UW,This is my favorite anime and I would totally buy this.. but $135?? Are you kidding me?? That is ridiculous. I bet it's not even the Tunami English dub. What a joke.,1512518400,,165,4.1875
8396062,3,B003FQT5UW,"I absolutely love this series - Bought all the manga and wanted the full anime series as well. I selected this option because it seemed like the best deal, and it's entirely possible I just happened to get a bad disk. But the Arai Shakku/Cho episodes (39-40) don't play correctly. I get maybe 5 minutes of episode 39, and the second half of episode 40. These are pretty pivotal episodes for Kenshin's development, not to mention really good. I tried reaching out to the seller/source of my set, and instead of sending me a new disk, they said ""well, we can refund some of your money, but that's about it."" I appreciated the refund, but I still have to hunt for those episodes online when I get to them - not something I want to do when I actually own the series. (Also, the artwork on the cases kind of looks like bad fan art...but maybe that's just me.)",1505865600,,854,4.377358490566038
8396063,5,B003FQT5UW,"I would not call this a complete series.  It doesn't have the beginning or end credits and a good 3 minutes was cut on the last episode of season 4.  The stars isn't for the product it's for the customer service.  As for the series, I'll probably save my pennies and pay the higher price for the COMPLETE series.",1482451200,4,312,4.254237288135593
8396064,5,B003FQT5UW,Amazing. One of my favorite Anime series of all time.,1477353600,,53,4.4
8396065,5,B003FQT5UW,I was a little wary when purchasing this dvd box set. I shopped around for something that was both a decent price and a nice box. I thought at first it might be a bootleg before buying it but after receiving and watching it I believe it to simply be the box set produced for the Chinese market. It's actually really nice and the menus are still in English. Just be sure to set the audio to English before playing it,1471996800,8,415,4.135802469135802
8396066,5,B003FQT5UW,Best anime ever,1456617600,2,15,4.333333333333333
8396067,3,B003FQT5UW,"Great show. Quick shipping. The only downside is I bought it new and episode 38 doesn't work. Would replace it, but I don't want to deal with the headache.",1455580800,2,155,4.379310344827586
