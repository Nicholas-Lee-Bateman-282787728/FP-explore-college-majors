7924834,5,B00004W4HG,"This DVD is a treasure and is a must have. Why? 3 simple things:

Losing My Religion
Mike Mills sings 2 songs
Peter's mandolin playing

Don't get me wrong, this is an A++ collection, but those are my 3 favorite things about it.

Just wish there was some bonus footage, but I'm happy to replace my VHS version of this with the DVD.",1371513600,,330,4.2063492063492065

I was saddened by the terrible production quality on the DVD, however.  There is extreme artifacting and poor colour through out.  I will put-off purchasing other videos until they re-master this series.",1039219200,11,249,5.2
