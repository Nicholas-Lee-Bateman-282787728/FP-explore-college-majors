8405498,5,B003TX8Q24,"As others have pointed out, this anime series mainly presents the story of Mari Wakatake and Hagino Senkji. each from very different worlds, who meet at the Kaih Academy, an exclusive boarding school for girls. Mari is the sole survivor of a disaster five years earlier. The nature of that disaster is not fully known and she has suppressed all memories of it. Hagino initially appears to be a trusted senior student at the academy, but soon we see she is something entirely different and eventually learn of her connection to that disaster. This, alone, is a complete sci-fi story with multiple sub-plots, as well as a mystery and a coming-of-age story. Also, all the main and supporting characters are female. It is somewhat a yuri story, though it is about intrigue, betrayal, friendship and maturation, rather than sexual attraction. However, in reading the other reviews, I noticed that some people seemed to be confused by the ending. That is because this anime is only part of a much larger story.

The anime story occurs at the verge of the Arume-Human wars. The Arume are an alien race in which all members are female. They are also very much technologically advanced. They expected to immediately and completely overwhelm earth's defenses, then subjugate the human race, but things did not go that way. The initial war and subsequent resistance are only briefly mentioned. The anime details events immediately prior to the initial invasion, very briefly shows its beginning, then jumps ahead to its end. Then, the manga series Blue Drop: Tenshi no Bokura covers a period after the war and, finally the manga Blue Drop covers events happening thousands of years later. Oddly enough, the chronological order of the publications of two manga series and anime is exactly the reverse of the chronological order of the events in the story. At any rate, the anime ending alludes to the start of the story already told in the manga.

The Blue Drop stories explore the interrelationship of technology and ""human"" nature, as well as a probable course of intercultural conflict and the beginnings of resolution. Unlike other anime series, the Blue Drop anime is not an animation of a manga, but a different story related to the manga. However, the anime was developed with norms suitable for broadcast TV. If you want to continue with the manga, some things are deeply disturbing and others are quite explicit.

The Blue Drop anime is a high-quality animation of a story which is part of a larger story. However, it is not a prequel. It doesn't lay the groundwork for the story continued in the manga and there is no need to get the rest of the story from the manga. Unless, of course, the ending really really bothers you.",1419206400,,2722,4.849462365591398
8405499,3,B003TX8Q24,"Mari Wakatake will start attending the exclusive all girl boarding school, Kaihou Academy. But Mari is arriving to the academy as a girl without her past. Five years ago something happened to her. Mari was the only survivor of Kamioki Island and has no memories of what happened. However, something not human also survived that night and is about to cross paths with Mari again. This something is an alien girl that also attends the academy. This girl is part of an all-female alien race. Mari thinks she is an enemy at first, but finds out she's wrong. This beautiful alien girl actually is protecting her. But the subjugation of Earth is starting and the feelings of a certain young woman might be the only thing that can protect it from destruction.

This is a 13 episode anime with ski-fi action and romance. It's a sweet show with mystery and endearing friendship and love. I found the ending sad though. This show is good, but not great. It's just an average anime. That's why I only gave it 3 stars.",1388016000,,1006,4.588888888888889
8405500,5,B003TX8Q24,Its an awesome movie and every episode is amazing. In the end they top it off with a tragic twist.,1382140800,,98,3.95
8405501,2,B003TX8Q24,"This anime has a lot going for it. Interesting characters, good animation, voice acting and a solid premise are usually the building blocks for a great anime. Blue Drop has all of these things. Even so, it's not very good. The backdrop wasn't explained very well, and the ending was terrible. I don't know if you can even call it an ending at all. The characters are likable and they are developed pretty well, but the whole premise of the story isn't explained very well. The relatonship between the main characters doesn't develop much either. Their romance was supposed to be the main focus, but it was barely lukewarm. It's a shame. This anime had a lot of potential. It was wasted...just like my money :(",1363219200,2,709,4.634920634920635
8405502,2,B003TX8Q24,"Blue Drop is different Anime science fiction.  It doesnt have robots or mecha combat.  It does have aliens that are going to invade the Earth, but they are all good-looking girls.  Blue Drop is long on human interest issues and short on action.  Its major issues are atonement for guilt and rebellion.  Blue Drop is oriented toward teenagers.  Many of its issues are teen issues and those that aren't are presented from the perspective of a teenager.

The heroine of the series is Marie, a Japanese teenager.  She is intense, excitable and likeable.  Hagino is an alien female that looks like a teenager.  Throughout most of the series, she is burdened by the guilt that she feels for the disaster that she created.  At times, that makes her seem mechanical and aloof.  In the last three episodes, she comes out of her shell and becomes more intense and emotional.  Unfortunately, we are never given the opportunity to learn much about Hagino as a person.  Azanel is an alien and looks like an adult woman.  Through most of the series, she seems unable to overcome her anger at Hagino, but in the last two episodes, she does a turn around and becomes a significant character.  There are many other characters in Blue Drop, but those are the characters that I feel contributed the most to the conclusion of the story.

The story moves at a slow pace, but something interesting manages to happen in all of its episodes except episodes 7 and 8.  Those two episodes are a drag.  The story is divided between what the aliens are doing and what Maries high school is doing.  The majority of the time is given to what her high school is doing.  Hagino is squabbling with her superiors and there is some combat between them.  Usually, the combat is short in duration and not intense.  It is only in the last episode that things heat up.

Blue Drop has four major subplots.  One involved how Marie learned what killed all of the other inhabitants of the island on which she lived and how she managed to survive.  The other three are how Hagino resolved the guilt that she felt, why she decided to rebel against her superiors, even though she knew that she would die doing that, and how she tried to deal with Azanels anger at her.

I didn't like Blue Drop.  It was too teen oriented for me to be able to adapt to.  I was unable to develop any interest in the students at Maries high school and their issues and activities.  I tried to focus on Hagino because she had an adult personality and issues.  That didn't work, because Blue Drop is too slanted, both in time and sympathy, toward Marie and her high school.  There didn't seem to be time in the story for us to learn anything about Haginos life and how she became the person that she was, but there was always plenty of the time in the story to relate inane events such as Maries problems passing her chemistry final exam.  Hagino moved through the story toward her inevitable demise without a whimper.  Before she died, she managed to make friends with Marie and Hagino seemed satisfied with being able to accomplish that before she died.

Im glad that I had the opportunity to watch Blue Drop.  Now, I know that I won't ever want to buy it or watch it a second time.  I do think that it would be suitable for a teenager, but not for an adult.",1362268800,,3291,4.470588235294118
8405503,4,B003TX8Q24,"Taking place in an Earth-based science fiction setting, Blue Drop's story unfolds in the time just before an impending invasion by an all female race of humanoid aliens. Hagino is the captain of a scouting vessel with a tragic story behind it. Mari is a young girl whose memories have been erased due to the shock of a terrible accident which she alone survived. These girls' lives intertwine as they seek to face their pasts as they learn from and heal one another. But what will happen as danger and chaos closes in around them?

Blue Drop has a number of aspects that recommend it. The soundtrack fits the flow and pace of the show quite well and Suara's opening theme is fittingly haunting and tragic. While the plot can drag at times and the emotional triggers are a tad clich, Blue Drop packs an emotional punch at the right points. The relationship between Hagino and Mari is really sweet and isn't over sexualized. I did find the sci-fi setting to be quite intriguing and, though it isn't unpacked enough, it kept me quite entertained. I was less than pleased with the ending - mostly because there is too much backdrop left unclear and some main plotlines whimper to a finish instead of ending with a bang (honestly, a story shouldn't leave too many areas to ask ""but wait, what about ...?""). But it comes together well enough. Fans of sci-fi and emotionally driven romance stories (BD reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maria-Watches-Over-Us-Season-1/dp/B00182O7EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maria Watches Over Us - Season 1</a>&nbsp;on more than one occasion) will find this satisfying.

One last note: being all female, the alien race mates with their own ""gender"", meaning this is definitely in the yuri/shouju-ai genre (as might have been obvious from my above comments). However, like Maria Watches over Us, the relationships depicted in the film are almost exclusively emotional (the relationship between two side characters being the only obvious exception) and are very tame (especially in relation to how explicit the manga adaptations are). Regardless, this may make some viewers uncomfortable, so be aware.",1314316800,2,2182,5.249283667621777
8405504,4,B003TX8Q24,"To start with this comes in a standard size DVD case with one DVD on each side,widescreen and the sound is done very well.
  If you need to have a ton of action in every episode then this is definately not for you. There is action but there are episodes that deal with real life situations,since this takes place at an all girls school. You see the new girl,Mari whom has never been to school before, struggle at first to make friends and then how she has bonded with them.

  I found this a very likable series. When it comes to the CGI it is incredible in spots,Gonzo had a hand in it, like when Mari first sees Hagino. As a whole the series mixed in real life situations and blended them seamlessly together with ""The Hunt for Red October"". It has suspense,drama and some great visuals when they battle.

  Even though the it is a subtitle only the voices are excellent as is the music. Both help set the mood of what you are watching.
  Replay value is all right. I gave it 4 stars because there were a couple of episodes seem to lag a little. Even with that being said I am pleased with the series and was glad that I bought it.

  As stated in the title. I reviewed the November 17th 2009 release of Blue Drop. I do not know why Amazon imports your reviews when something is re-released as things are subject to change which can change what you are reviewing.

  However I have ordered the September 7th 2010 release of Blue Drop because it states that it is in both Japanese and English. I myself prefer English and I will update this review after I watch the newest version. I just wish this would have come out in Blu-Ray as some of the colors are so vibrant and this would even better.

 Yes this is in English 2.0 and they used well known voices like Luci Christain - Monica Rial - Hillary Haag & Britney Karbowski. I am glad to see this out in English. Remember ""English"" applies only to the 2010 release. Also this is the same style of case as the previous release..a single size DVD case with one Disc on each side. Other than it being in English now....nothing has changed that I noticed.",1271635200,11,2103,4.2944162436548226
8405505,5,B003TX8Q24,"Blue Drop is a title that I quite surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  I'm not normally one for yuri or ""yuri-ish"" titles, but this one was quite exceptional.  The relationship between the two girls was handled quite well, and despite the often targeted audience for these titles, there was no overabundance of fan service.

The sci-fi story line is also excellent and quite intriguing.  It pulled me in right away and left enough of a lasting impression for me to wish the series had been longer, or hope for an eventual follow-up.  Basically, women from an alternate dimension cross into ours with intentions of conquering our world.  There are no men left in their world, and their population is slowly dying.  However, one Captain finds herself quite taken with the humans she encounters and decides to fight for them.  Yeah, it sounds a bit trivial, but it is told and handled beautifully.

You also can't discuss Blue Drop without mentioning the amazing artwork.  The animation, character and location designs are all beautiful.  There is an amazing amount of detail in the art of this series that truly allows it to shine.  The ship designs in particular stand out as a cut above the norm.

Despite the action, mytery and sci-fi elements, it's the relationship between the two main characters and the surrounding cast that really make this show something special.  They're very sympathetic characters who truly make you care about them.  In the end, when one of them is forced to make an unimaginable sacrifice, the moment is very touching and heart felt.  It is one of the better anime endings I have seen in some time, despite leaving the story a bit open.  (The anime only deals with the very beginning of the manga.)

Also, for those interested in a dub, Sentai Filmworks has produced a dub for this show.  It was not available when this set was released last year, but will available in a later set.  So if you must have a dub, you should give the upcoming set a try.",1269388800,10,1979,4.664739884393064
8405506,5,B003TX8Q24,"Blue Drop is an unique, character driven anime series that combines elements of space opera with slice of life high school drama.
The story focuses on the relationship between Mari Wakatake, orphaned five years earlier, and Hagino Senkouji, who cannot forget the horrific tragedy that links them.
Hagino, wracked with guilt for the loss of her crew, as well as the deaths of Mari's family and home. Mari, unable to remember her past, but sensing some connection to Hagino from the past.
With vibrant animation, a compelling story, and fully fleshed out characters, including several lovable background characters, Blue Drop is not a series one would easily forget.

Take note that the series does not have an English dub, and is subtitled only. Don't let that hinder your enjoyment though of this amazing and heartfelt series.",1266624000,17,826,5.073529411764706
