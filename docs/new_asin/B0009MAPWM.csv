2299671,2,B0009MAPWM,"I got a review copy of this and decided to torture myself with AFV, just to see how long I could take it. Answer: Less than an hour was enough to make me walk away.

Don't get me wrong: watching someone get hit in the crotch can be funny. And some of the videos were genuinely humorous, but host Tom Bergeron could suck the fun out of a circus. His segueways are so belabored, he has to turn to the Jay Leno method at least twice a show to remind people that all the laughter he gets is out of pity. At least he can recognize it.

Suitable for almost all physical ages, but people with normal human adult intelligences might want to steer clear of repeated contact. Maybe it won't cause brain damage, but about three shows in and I was ready to start scooping out my gray matter with a spoon to end the misery.",1121472000,7,810,4.1528662420382165

2299686,2,B0009MAPWM,"Decades ago, there were television specials where television newscasters or television actors would flub things live, and the audience would have a laugh.  With the debut of making home videos cheaply as technology progressed, home videos became more and more common-with the flubs from that too.  People would send them, the audience would see them, and laugh-and there were enough of those to make a regular television series possible.

But then, as the show progressed, there were clearly more and more staged ""bloopers"" being sent in, and when large cash prizes were awarded, people tried to outdo each other in how crazy said ""bloopers"" could be.  Also, the running joke about ""being hit in the gonads"" was funny the first time-but not the ten thousandth time.  It didn't matter who the hosts were, it was the videos that truly mattered-and they became so obviously stagy it was like watching a series of bad sitcoms and slapstick videos.  The show may go on, but has no reason to anymore.",1405641600,3,994,4.886904761904762

2299710,4,B0009MAPWM,"I love this collection!!! I realize that there are some people out there that can be turned off by some of the content, however this is a great collection from the Bergeron years (the best). What I like best about this DVD set is it is a broken into each individual show rather than conbining several of them together. This is why I call it the best traveling DVD ever, your kids can watch it on short trips or they can put in for the long haul. Maybe I am a too easily entertained but I could watch this over and over without getting tired of it. The only content that I sometimes have problems watching are the groin hits, bratty kids, and baby spit-up montage. However, that's life and thats what makes it funny. You gotta relate to some of these situations and laugh because you felt it too or yes maybe even you have been thrown up on a few times by your kids. Your kids will love this DVD and us parents can laugh right along with them, its good to show them that its alright to screw up and make a fool of yourself sometimes. The only complaint I have is that by containing about a seasons worth of videos, a 100,000 dollar show, and a 300th episode special there will be a few repeats between them. Buy this set and it will make your car trips easier!!! You may however feel the urge to look in the backseat and see what your kids are laughing at, but remember: RESIST THE URGE!!!",1155686400,11,1388,4.2218045112781954

2299713,4,B0009MAPWM,"I definitely am always in the mood for something incredibly funny at times. That has been the case with the ABC show America's Funniest Home Videos. Since its debut in 1989 with Bob Saget, the show has been a constant in our lives and television. Yet, the show has really been a real status for laughter. While the show has constantly changed with the times, so have the hosts as well from Bob Saget who played Danny Tanner from Full House, the odd short-lived duo of Daisy Fuentes and John Fugelsang, and our current master of ceremonies Tom Bergeron who has done well as the recent host of Hollywood Squares. The question for Beregeron is could he deliver as the host, the answer is yes.

America's Funniest Home Videos, Volume 1 is a look at the first season through Tom Bergeron as the host. His delivery is a real return to the hilariousness that has made the show a absolute legend for ABC. The DVD set includes several episodes from his first year the host, including side-spliting video clips that just are incredibly funny in some cases and other unfortunately aren't. The collection also includes celebrated episodes like the 300th total series episode, and of course the usual $100,000 grand prize show.

All in all, I personally haven't seen all of the first year Tom Bergeron has hosted with America's Funniest Home Videos, but I definitely know that he feelings of funniness are there. I can't wait to see this year in full on DVD, and laugh out loud like everyone else. This is a great buy for fans of AFV, or anybody who hasn't seen the series at all.

2299714,5,B0009MAPWM,"I got this DVD set for Christmas, and it is excellent!  These are the newer Home Videos, starring Tom Bergeron as the host, who, in my opinion, is a much funnier and more charismatic host than Bob Sagat was. (not that Bob Sagat was bad, just kinda cheesy).  Now you can watch all the hilarity without having to sit thorough commercials, and it's good fun to watch some of the clips in slow motion to really capture the moment.  At any rate, home videos was always a funny show, and has always been one of my favorites.  I was quite surprised to get this as a gift, as I didn't even know it had been released on DVD.
