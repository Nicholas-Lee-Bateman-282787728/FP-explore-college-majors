8453452,5,B00520JWXO,My 1 1/2 year old daughter and I have had SO much fun with this video. We do it about two times a week. I can DEF feel it the next day and it is a great way for her and I to keep active while we are cooped up inside during these winter months!,1422576000,,243,3.4363636363636365
8453453,5,B00520JWXO,"refer to reviews for Mom and Baby Fitness, earlier released 1 DVD version with same mom and baby on front.  This ""deluxe edition"" has a 2nd DVD for toddlers and moms.  One negative review here is not at all consistent with the many positive reviews for the first version.
Heather Gilstrap's review belongs here.",1409875200,,311,4.7407407407407405
8453454,2,B00520JWXO,Not all that impressed with this. I figured you would be holding baby more often instead of letting the baby do it's own thing half the time you are working out... If you want a better baby work out dvd I would go with Dustin Maher's dvds Baby tone or Fit Moms for Life they are a lot LOT better!,1354838400,,296,3.95
