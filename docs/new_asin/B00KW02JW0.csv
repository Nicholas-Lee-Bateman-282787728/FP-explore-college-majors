6452055,5,B00KW02JW0,"What more can you say about Bonanza than the 3 excellent and helpful reviews that are already posted. Tomasi's intellegent and helpful insights into the background of Pernell Roberts and the interesting comments regarding Guy Williams were so intriguing. And then ""pony"" follows up with a incredible comprehensive review of the entire package with information about all the extra features - absolutely a perfect review. Then Timothy P Roberts provides us with an episode list.

So what I have to add then is slightly off the track, but in light of all these price complaints lately on Gunsmoke and Bonanza. I think it's time for Amazon to rethink their review rating policy.

There is a huge major problem with the Amazon review system. Like in the case of the Gunsmoke reviews, it bases the most 'helpful' reviews on the number of votes received, whether the comments have anything to do with the show or not. Just look at the first page and you'll see the most helpful votes based on the most ridiculous price complaints - why would Amazon assign a most helpful rating to someone who is telling them not to buy their product?

Then another major problem, like in the reviews of Big Valley S3 or Happy Days S5, is that the front page is filled with reviews of people saying they can hardly wait for the next season to come out, reviews that are 2 years older or more taking away space from any new review because of the number of votes received in the past, so any recent review gets buried in the pile because it doesn't have a chance to get noticed when it's only up on the first page for a day or so.

And a third major problem , like the reviews for Justified, there are hundreds and hundreds of 1 line reviews flooding the site that say Five Stars or Great or some other meaningless phrase so that any meaningful review with good comments only stays on the front page for a day or less.

What then Amazon has to do to fix these problems is to clear the trail by cleaning the slate, take off all reviews from the front page that are not current, that were written before the product was released and move them to the last pages, and then enforce all new reviews to at least 100 words, so that we don't have to be spammed with thousands of meaningless 1 to 5 liners saying Great, Cool, Love This, 5 stars, etc. We want to read real reviews.

So basically now the only option one has is to find a reviewer that you like, and then go to his See All My Reviews list or Profile, so that you can actually read some critical comments.",1409875200,3,2532,4.411134903640257
6452056,5,B00KW02JW0,"From The Debt to A Dollar's Worth of Trouble, Season 7 delivers in fully remastered living color. Tommy Sands, Tim Considine and Wayne Newton are only a few of the many familiar guest stars in this season. Any Star Trek fan will quickly recognize DeForest Kelley, Majel Barret,  John Hoyt and more. Clint Howard even does an audio commentary.

The extras include not only audio commentaries but special vintage interviews, behind the scenes and on location photos, the Ride The Wind (1966) feature film along with it's trailer. So, lots of extras, remastered episodes and what else? Well, it's funny, sad, thoughtful and interesting all in one show. Definitely worth the time and money!",1409788800,7,686,5.008771929824562

6452058,5,B00KW02JW0,"BONANZA: The Official Seventh Season is a fine addition to the wonderful collections CBSHE has put out previously. Here are my opinions and observations.

First the all-important technical details: all 33 episodes, digitally re-mastered and restored from 35mm film elements, look fantastic. Details like actors makeup and clothing texture are really impressive. Nothing  not even the oft. mentioned Germany sets -- can compare with the picture and sound quality of the shows on this new set. Until CBSHE puts the shows out on Blu-Ray, theres nothing better out there. Be assured of that, dear BONANZA believers.

Next, the fantastic bonus features weve come to expect from CBSHE and DVD Executive Producer Andrew J. Klyde. This set does not disappoint, and this viewer is still thrilled how they're able to do that (and still grumbles why others are not able to include such great special features after a vintage series initial season release on DVD).

Heres a detailed list of Special Features:

-- Michael Dantes memories  the charismatic actor, recorded at a 2011 BONANZA convention in Burbank, shares his memories of the BONANZA cast, a near-mishap while filming, and how he was in the running for the part of Adam Cartwright.

-- A fascinating, complete interview with Dan Blocker from 1965 (a short excerpt was included in a previous set). Articulate, intelligent Dan comments on the recent 1964 presidential election, how he finds his character every morning and leaves him at the studio every night, and talks about Pernell Roberts (newly departed from the series).

 actor Clint Howard and his father, actor Rance Howard, offer fascinating recollections about the making of All Ye His Saints. Clint was six at the time, but has vivid memories. Example: He knew he was in a strange place when he got off the plane from Los Angeles and saw something hed never seen before: slot machines in the Reno airport! The Howards also share beautiful photos taken on location at Lake Tahoe.

-- many eps. contain wonderful Chevrolet commercials, undoubtedly unseen since the series aired on NBC during the 1965-66 season. Somebody loved to pair big Dan Blocker with big Chevy trucks! (And Mike gets to pitch the new Corvair Monza.) Lorne narrates the by now annual tradition, a 5-min. spot introducing the new shapes for 66, following an uninterrupted episode of BONANZA.

 DVD Executive Producer, historian and BONANZA expert Andrew J. Klyde provides lots of juicy, behind-the-scenes tidbits in his Ride the Wind audio commentary. He shares some great stories told to him by folks who were there.

-- Ride the Wind was released as a feature film outside the U.S. in 1966. This set includes the rarely seen full-length film, and its trailer. (Ive seen the feature film version before on VHS, way back in 1986, but Ive never seen the trailer. It sounds like the narrator is British, but trying to sound like hes from the U.S.)

-- A most curious but entertaining short is Impact 66, a featurette touting the virtues of the new 1966 model Chevrolets. Lorne Greene is in full Ben Cartwright costume (although he acknowledges the year is 1966!) at the Apacheland Movie Ranch in Arizona, and does some fancy sharpshooting to make his impactful point. Also present is legendary announcer and fellow Canadian Joel Aldred; Aldred announced most Chevrolet commercials in the 50s and 60s and interestingly, worked with Lorne Greene at the CBC in the late 40s.

-- PS.A. announcement with Dan Blocker  this must be pretty rare; Dan urges fellow Texans to give generously to help fight leukemia.

-- a whole bunch of cool, never-before-seen (or at least rarely seen) behind-the-scenes, episodic and publicity photos (several in color); and accompanying many episodes and photos (and other bonus features) are Klydes helpful on-screen texts containing fascinating details.

The elephant in the room of course, is Adam Cartwright (whos actually nowhere in the room or anywhere on the Ponderosa, because Pernell Roberts left the series several weeks before filming began in the spring of 1965). Adam is missed (and in fact in his audio commentary, Andy Klyde discusses how the producer and writing team worked very hard to keep the series where it was at the end of season six  the number one show in the nation  and they succeeded, because season seven also was rated number one). I would however urge Adams Madams not to dismiss this season outright. Tell yourself Adam is away in San Francisco (an excuse used for all the boys occasionally when an actor had a week off) and enjoy many classic episodes from this season.

Just to name a few worthy of your attention: the previously mentioned All Ye His Saints (in fact Clint Howard reveals writer William Blinn wrote this show with Pernell Roberts in mind, but then re-wrote it and made Little Joe the featured Cartwright), Action master director William Witneys Ride the Wind, writer Thomas Thompsons dual contributions, The Lonely Runner and The Other Son, (both excellent stories with terrific guests  Ed Bigley and Gilbert Roland -- and featuring spectacular location footage at Lake Tahoe), Wayne Newtons dramatic debut (certainly memorable) in The Unwritten Commandment, the charming comedy The Meredith Smith (with a great guest cast, including Robert Colbert, months from The Time Tunnel, Strother Martin, pre-Cool Hand Luke, and everyones favorite old man, Burt Mustin), and dangerous Marie Windsor in the thrilling Five Sundowns to Sunup, among others.

Buy this collection; you won't regret it.",1409702400,42,5540,5.077092511013216
6452059,5,B00KW02JW0,"YEAH, I LOVE MICHAEL LANDON...THANKS CBS!!!!!! Since Adam was my least favorite character...I don't care that he is not in Seasons 7-14.

6452061,4,B00KW02JW0,"While I've been anxiously awaiting the Season Seven set of Bonanza, I have to be honest and say that my rating was affected overall because of the absence of Adam.  He was, and has always been, my MOST favorite character/actor in the series.  Not to diminish the other outstanding actors (trickster Landon, Greene, and gentle ""Hoss""), but Roberts just added that extra special something that none of the other three could do.  I remember being devastated when the series was being broadcast and the new season did not have Adam.  For many weeks, I missed the show because I was so disappointed and it didn't seem worth it to me.  However, in the years since, I do enjoy the entire series.  I choose to think of Adam as being somewhere just out of sight.  But, oh, how I missed him.  I kept wishing for his return.....",1407628800,24,817,4.5479452054794525

6452063,4,B00KW02JW0,"Season 7 is the first full Adamless season (Pernell Roberts wasn't in 10 episodes of season 6) and season 7 was left completely out of the 1973 syndication rerun package of Bonanza (which contained 260 episodes from seasons 1-6; 8-11). Fortunately, it was included with the balance of 170 ""Lost Episodes"", which were released in 1988, and comprised the remainder of the series. The episodes are fantastic, as the other Cartwrights rise to the occaision. Incidentally, these episodes were never lost, but were sitting in an NBC storage facility in Fort Lee, NJ. Season 7 was Bonanza's second of three consecutive seasons in the #1 spot in the Nielsen Ratings. I removed one star for the absence of Pernell Roberts. Like Dennis Weaver (Chester Goode) who'd left Gunsmoke a season earlier, and offered to make a guest appearance in a later season of Gunsmoke, Roberts had also offered to make occasional appearances as Adam (he is mentioned on Bonanza as late as season 12). Don Knotts, who left Mayberry in 1965, after 5 seasons, returned for 6 guest appearances as Barney Fife in later seasons of The Andy Griffith Show and the debut of Mayberry R.F.D. But the producers of Gunsmoke and Bonanza, declined guest appearances by former regulars, and I believe we are the poorer for it. Towards the end of his life, Bonanza's executive producer/creator, David Dortort, said that he only recently appreciated Pernell Roberts, adding, that he improved any scene he was in.",1403740800,51,1465,4.959349593495935

Although Pernell Roberts is gone after season 6, I didn't feel his departure diminished the show in any way.  After all, there must be a reason why the show continued to do so well for another 7 1/2 years AFTER he left. Three of the main reasons for its continued success:  Lorne Greene, Dan Blocker and Michael Landon.  All excellent actors and all of them doing an amazing job, together.

There are many terrific episodes in season 7: Ride the Wind (parts 1 and 2), Devil on Her Shoulder, Natural Wizard (great story featuring 2 excellent guest stars), Her Brother's Keeper and more.

TV today could and should take a lesson from Bonanza on ensemble casts, great guest stars and story lines.  I can't wait to own all of the Bonanza episodes!

6452109,5,B00KW02JW0,"This was the first season without Pernell Roberts as Adam Cartwright who had left the show. He never liked the show and could not wait to get out of his contract. Everybody on the show were worried that the show could not survive with one Cartwright gone. They needn't have worried. The show became even more popular.
These are the seasons I remember having never seen Adam Cartwright until all six of the previous seasons were released on DVD. For that much thanks to CBS Home Entertainment.
As always this show was high on production values and stories and it continued for another successful seven years.
Guest stars this season include, Tommy Sands,Gilbert Roland,Strother Martin,Robert Colbert, ( who looks to be wearing the same clothes from his stint on ""Maverick"", fourth season as brother Brent),Glenn Corbett,Tim Considine,Eddie Hodges,Leif Erickson,Deforest Kelly,Eric Fleming,George Montgomery and Wayne Newton to name a few.
Bonus material include commercials for Chevrolet cars and trucks,interview with guest star Michael Dante from episode ""The Brass Box"", audio commentary by Clint and Rance Howard and Andy J Clyde,early interview with Dan Blocker and photo galleries.
Here are some of the episodes I especially liked. Though all are good.

THE OTHER SON
Ben hires an old friend and his two sons to transport nitroglycerin to Virginia City

THE LONELY RUNNER
When a judge awards a prized horse to another man guest star Gilbert Roland decides to get the horse back.

FOUND CHILD

THE MEREDITH SMITH
Ben is asked to be executor to a will and find a dying man's next of kin called Meredith Smith. A case of will the real Meredith Smith please stand up as several appear including a woman and even a chinaman.
Watch Lorne Greene's expression with each new arrival as well as when the bills mount up and Ben has to pay for them. A real funny episode

FIVE SUNDOWNS TO SUNUP
A man in jail awaiting hanging while his murderous family start kidnapping the local citizens claiming each one will die unless their kin is released from jail. Little Joe is one of the kidnapped.

ALL YE HIS SAINTS
Believeing an old indian legend that God lives at the top of a tall mountain, a little boy played by Clint Howard goes in search of God to save his father who has been accidentally shot and is near death. But who he believes is God is really a hermit who years ago massacred a tribe of indian women and children and has been hiding out on the mountain.
(This episode was intended for Pernell Roberts but since his departure from the series Michael Landon had to step into the role. This would not be the last time Michael Landon would have to do this as in the fourteenth and final season of Bonanza the two-part episode ""Forever"" intended as a show case for Hoss was changed when Dan Blocker died in hospital from complications after an operation.)
Rance is the real father to Clint Howard who appeared in the TV series""Gentle Ben"" and Ron Howard who appeared in ""Happy Days"" as Richie Cunningham and is now a talented director.

RIDE THE WIND (two-parter)
Little Joe joins the newly formed Pony Express while the Paiutes go on the warpath.
There is a poignant moment between Ben and Hop Sing when months have passed and with Hoss and Little Joe away Ben looks across the lonely room and as the camera pans back  says to Hop Sing, ""Listen, Hop Sing do you hear the silence. Once this was a happy home."" As he walks away Hop Sing whispers under his breath ""I don't like the silence either"".
Anyone who has had a family and the children have grown up and left the home or whose parents have passed away and you are the only one left in the house will hear this silence.
This scene is usually left out in syndication as it doesn't further the story but, is a very touching moment.
This show is also included as a theatrical european release on this DVD as an extra.
