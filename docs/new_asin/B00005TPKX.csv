1661882,5,B00005TPKX,"The Anime Series FLCL (Fooly Cooly, or as in japan, Furi Kuri) is an very off beat anime created by Gainax, the same people responsable for Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is basically about a kid who starts growing robots out of his head. no really. although the plot is very odd and sometimes makes no sense, the reactions of the characters, the very odd ball humor (they even have a section where they look like south park characters O_O ), and the BEST SOUNDTRACK (well next to Yoko Kanno stuff :)  ) ON ANY ANIME!! The band that does most of the music, the Pillows, is a very awesome band and they should be looked up.

1661905,5,B00005TPKX,"This anime investigates deep aspects of relationships, and the confusion in becoming an adult. At the same time it is purposely unreal, and uncontrolled. Haruko's arrival sends the central characters flying out of their stagnant existence, and leaves Naota headed in a much better direction. All this is balanced by flying motor scooters, a mysterious woman wielding a guitar as a baseball bat, and increasingly large and mysterious things spawning from Naota's head.

Watching this in Amazon Video gives me no options to watch the series as it was intended and for that I am dissatisfied with my purchase and would rather get the series on blu ray if available or dvd.

1661944,5,B00005TPKX,"This show is life changing. At first it appears to be a totally random and silly anime, which it is, but upon further investigation you find that there is deep meaning in every scene of this show. Being so short, and so brilliantly done, there is no scene, no dialogue, indeed no single word that is not necessary to the flawless expression of what this show conveys. This show offers a commentary on the coming of age of Naota but in such a outrageous way that sometimes it can be easy to overlook what meaning this show has for us all.
I am no professional critic certainly and I don't propose to write an exposition on the philosophy of this show, although it appeals to me, so I will simply say: if you are considering buying this show and have not seen it before, do it. It has limitless potential for entertainment.

1661947,2,B00005TPKX,"Fooly Cooly, Volume One, has two episodes, commentary and out takes.  Oh, and a nice booklet inside the holder.  The story is about an alien girl, or so she says, who attacks robots that come out of a kid's forehead.  A kid she ran over herself with her scooter.  Much of the future plot or details of the story was given away in the commentary, so much of the mystery, if any, was destroyed for me before I even got past the first DVD.  But that's not the biggest problem.  The biggest problem I had was with the fact that, new or used, this DVD held only two episodes.
Two episodes?  Only two?  Sure, the artwork is interesting, the story line WAS interesting and the voice work is great, but that is no excuse to make me buy this series two episodes at a time.  I didn't take that from Farscape, why would I take it from FLCL?  Come on, give me a break.  I've heard lots of good stuff about this anime series but I'd become a pirate before I pay full prices for this.  I just don't have that much money!

1661959,4,B00005TPKX,"Anime can be pretty weird -- just look at series like ""Paranoia Agent"" and ""Boogiepop Phantom."" Total confusion.

But for sheer strangeness and kookiness, the one on top has got to be ""Fooly Cooly (FLCL)."" As it pokes fun at anime conventions, the first volume tells the weird story of an atypical coming-of-age -- surreal storytelling, oddball characters, and robots sprouting out of a young boy's head.

Naota is a twelve-year-old boy living what he sees as an oppressively dull existance, in a quiet city dominated by the Medical Mechanica building. The closest thing to excitement is fending off the advances of his brother's troubled girlfriend Mamimi.

Then sudenly a girl on a Vespa runs him over, resuscitates him with a smooch, and then bashes him over the head with a bass guitar. That evening, Naota finds that instead of a bump, he has a horn growing out of his head, and no idea what it is or how to get rid of it.

Despite his efforts to avoid her, Naoto's kooky father has hired the crazy Vespa girl, Haruko, as a housekeeper. To make matters worse, his ""horn"" turns out to be a robot and a giant mechanical hand -- springing out of his head.

Things don't improve much in the second episode, where the now-tamed robot is being used for household duties and errands, including fetching Hustler and moving boxes. Naoto isn't pleased with this weird twist -- or with Haruko's continued presence -- but he's powerless to stop either one.

Then the troubled Mamimi sees the robot (wearing a pair of dark wings), and mistakes it for the Dark Flame god Cantide from her favorite pyromaniacal video game. And Naoto finds that he's got some new horns -- and they're about to set off a massive robot battle.

For newbies, ""FLCL"" is probably the WORST anime to start with. It's a parodic mishmash of anime in-jokes -- giant robots, fanservice, boy falls for kooky abusive alien girl -- and a storyline that is bizarre to the point where you may not be able to understand what's going on. But oh, is it a fun ride.

Even the animation is done in an exaggerated, crazy way, full of distorted faces and crazy robot battles. Lots of hyperactive action and overdramatic dialogue (""OH NO.... OOOOOOOOO... an American GIRLFRIEND!""). And it's sprinkled with hysterical little metafictional moments, like the characters griping to the audience about doing ""slow motion"" shots.

And the characters are as bizarre and spoofy as the story itself -- Naoto is a typical bored preteen, who idolizes his big brother and wants a quasi-normal life, while Haruko is a completely off-the-wall kook who says she's an alien. And Mamimi makes the story even more bizarre -- and a little poignant -- as a lonely pyromaniac.

The first two episodes of ""FLCL"" are enough to blow the top off of your head, with the strange characters and wildly surrealist plot. Fooly Cooly!",1184803200,,2852,4.755060728744939
1661960,5,B00005TPKX,"This Anime means a lot to me (this is Elisa's teenage son). FLCL and my Ramones Cd's and hackey-sack, learning how to play guitar, the Beatles, discovering Classic Rock, these things all remind me of growing up with my friends. FLCL is very nostalgic. I hate how people bash this Anime for not having a plot. It's all there if you know the significance of the little things. But I guess with this, you either get it or you don't. Of course, probably not everybody loves this anime for the same reasons. It's got soul, though. And the music is great. I loved Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo too; I don't see why people shouldn't also like FLCL. You've just got to remember how it was to be immature and inexperienced. To be a kid, you know? Who cares who's laughing? There's nothing wrong with listening to Lead Belly and the Ramones. And I don't think there's anything wrong with reading Bukowski as well as Stephen King. FLCL rocks.",1177632000,3,935,4.538461538461538
1661961,5,B00005TPKX,This is the best anime ever!!! I can say that from the bottom of my heart. It is more a story about coming of age and of don't take what u got for granite. It may not be there tomorrow. Fooly Cooly is about Naota(a 12 year-old boy) and a 20 year-old girl named Haruko. Its confusing but addictive.,1160265600,,297,4.0508474576271185
1661962,5,B00005TPKX,"As many other reviewers have noted FLCL is not your standard anime. Neither is it a satire piece like one reviewer suggested (it has aspects of this but it doesn't dare present this as any cohesive light). What FLCL is though happens to be an amazingly high quality production that mixes and matches a bunch of different themes in order to provide the viewer with an all around fun experience.

FLCL is a story about sexual awareness and coming of age and yet introduces it along side of an exciting if somewhat disjointed aliens-meet-rock and roll music video-type storyline. All of the disjointedness in the series is what makes it interesting: it most certainly is intentional, though the serious/obscure themes present most certainly can be followed by the average movie viewer.

As for the main storyline - the one dealing with robots and aliens - well the truth is that while it isn't ""average"" it isn't exactly above average either. FLCL is all about having fun and experiencing those serious adolescent themes through a series which is of insanely high production value. In essence FLCL is so damn original because is combines a high standard with a rather fun main storyline (a main story, dealing with ""robots"" and ""aliens"" which is rather watered down).

Again the side-storylines - or more obscure plotlines depending on your view point - make FLCL an amazing short series. These side stories deal with sexual awareness, coming of age and related confusions, and youth's dependence on fast paced anime series. There are of course many other themes hinted at but this reviewer would recommend viewing the series and deciding what themes were most important to you. If you are at all interested in seeing these themes portrayed in a high quality fashion, than FLCL is a series worth checking out.

With the side-storylines and plot devices aside, the series is of extremely high quality. This cannot be understated. Expert cell shading, animation and design is combined with past paced action sequences when appropriate as well as heart wrenching slow sequences, sequences in which the production quality is noticeably higher than in other parts of the show as if to emphasize the importance of the aforementioned side-storylines. The fun music combined with expert voice acting and an overall great sound quality tops off the FLCL experience.

A lot of people dislike the disjointed aspects of FLCL and consider it ""childish."" Typically these viewers have only seen a few episodes of the series on television (Cartoon Network's Adult Swim). While the series does well to blend high quality aspects with silly manga-style 2D art (during silly sequences in the series), the series as a whole does not take these moments too seriously like in anime series like Chobits which comes across as a lot less mature. The reason FLCL comes across as more mature than many other series is because the wacky disjointed sequences are expertly tied into the emotional layers of the side-storylines mentioned above.

The only way to really grasp the type of series this is would be to simply watch it. The disjointed elements of FLCL will immediately ""make sense"" upon seeing the series as a whole (although nothing particularly interesting happens in the end, again, just a few episodes should be more than enough to grasp the side-storylines mentioned above).

If you're an anime fan and you're willing to watch all 3-discs than I would pick up FLCL today. The themes mentioned are delivered expertly in mind-blowing quality, supplemented with a terrific soundtrack. Truly in the eyes of this reviewer FLCL is extremely unforgettable and well worth seeing today!",1158969600,3,3659,5.028052805280528
1661963,5,B00005TPKX,"What can I say? This anime is easily one of the best ever, if not THE best ever, which I'm inclined to say it is. The depth it offers in its ingenious design is staggering to say the least (try watching an episode in slow motion, for example) Though the story appears simple at first glance the inner story of a young boy's coming of age and sexual discovery will become increasingly more apparent with every repeat viewing (and yes, this series does inspire many, many repeat viewings) This anime is incredibly intelligent as well, utilizing many psychosexual symbols (viewers with a knowledge of psychology will find a wealth of these) and delivering profound statements without being patronizing or condescending towards the viewer...and the ending; so happy and so sad at the same time. Indeed, this is my favorite anime and I think that anyone with an open mind and a memory of their own sexual discovery will find that Furi Kuri is extremely rewarding to watch again and again.",1157414400,2,983,4.788235294117647
1661964,5,B00005TPKX,"The FLCL has all the elements of your typical anime: Robots?  Check.  Girls with impossibly long legs, no discernable knees, and large sparkling eyes?  Check.  Apocalyptic battle that destroys an entire city?  Check.  That peculiar Japanese obsession with young girl's panties?  Check.  Yet the underlying  plot has nothing to do with any of these elements.  Rather, it's about a young boy dealing with the onset of puberty, his first crush, family relationship, Oedipus Complex and separation anxiety.  Sigmund Freud would have had a field day with this.  And the creators have the poor kid pitch-perfect with your typical teenage ennui, downplaying everything and anything, the awkwardness with his changing body, sense of inferiority being constantly compared to his brother (had this been done by Hollywood, it would have had Frankie Muniz as Takkun, trying way too hard to be hip and cool).  Episode #6 is simply breath-taking in its art and heartbreaking in its story as the series draws to an end.",1152748800,3,1004,5.1234567901234565
1661965,5,B00005TPKX,"I've seen a fair amount of anime in my day, but FLCL is by far my favorite.  It's obviously strange and random beyond reason on the surface, but it harbors a surprisingly intricate and, at times, moving story underneath.  It's the only anime series/movie I've ever felt the unearthly compulsion to buy (except maybe Cowboy Bebop) and is a beautifully animated, fantastic piece of entertainment.",1152489600,4,394,5.046153846153846
1661976,4,B00005TPKX,"FLCL is a good and notably random series.  Since the first one is the most random, it makes sense that it's the best.  If you look for this story for the humor, satire, randomness, etc., you won't be disappointed.  As for the story, it sucks; it's really poorly developed, and it's wrapped together really quickly at the end.  A friend of mine tried to convince me that it was a good story, but there's really no arguing; if you screw up telling a story the first time, you don't often get a second chance to tell it.  If you're looking for something partly random, partly satire, and well-done but complicated, go for Evangelion; it's a classic, well-known and loved by fans of anime.  FLCL is mostly for people who are in the habit of being incoherent.  I'm a fan of randomness, but the attempt of telling a story half-assedly does not appeal to me; FLCL's short duration would have been better spent with full-on randomness, leaving the story out completely.  So, it's not a waste of time, but if you're looking for some good anime really quickly, I recommend My Neighbor Totoro (Tonari no Totoro), Tokyo Godfathers, and Howl's Moving Castle, not this.",1148515200,,1155,4.655172413793103
1661977,5,B00005TPKX,"This anime has so many interesting elements combined from different genius anime artists with their own unique styles.  Gainax (the Evangelion creators) and Production I.G.( a group of skilled animators) teamed up to create this astounding series.  You notice the change in styles between episodes and during dramatic events.  The story itself, is completely original and incredible!  Actually, its mind-blowing in all ways possible.  It does leave you with tons of unanswered questions, but they have a 2-book manga out with alterations to the story that give you more information to help you connect the dots.  Overall, this series is in my top three favorites!!!

PS - The soundrack is great as well!",1144454400,2,703,5.168141592920354
1661978,5,B00005TPKX,"This is by far the BEST anime out there, and I've seen a lot. FLCL has one crazy storyline, awesome music and stunning animation. I'm an animator myself, and I know when to appreciate great animation. This story deftly blends CGI, 2D and even has a fake manga scene. FLCL is only 6 episodes long...but it's long enough. The music by The Pillows is definitely one of its highlights. The spunky rock `n' roll makes you want to bang your head and cheer!!

FLCL features some crazy characters and a plot line that is so out there that you're not sure you even understood what you just witnessed. But do not fear; that's its charm. Underneath the bizarre plot lies a coming of age story about finding ones self and learning life's hard lessons. The more you watch it the more you get from it. Most anime you watch once then you're done with it, not this one. A second viewing is recommended.

The DVD even features a nice director's commentary that helps explain some of the inside jokes and zaniness of the story. The dub is quite as good as the original japanese, and makes understanding some of the story a bit easier. I always watch both the sub and dub versions because you come away with something slightly different.

The only downfall is not the anime itself, but the packaging. The cover art work is amazing, but to put 6 episodes on 3 DVDs is a bit ridiculous. But, if you are a die hard fan you just suck it up...Luckily they have a box set available now.

If you like anime that has giant robot's popping out of people's heads, a girl from outer space, people getting beaten with bass guitars, and Vespa bikes, then this is something you most definitely want to check out.",1141776000,,1679,4.441558441558442
1661979,5,B00005TPKX,"Fooly Cooly is one of the most brilliant examples of... well, to be honest, I'm not quite sure what I can call it aside from 'brilliant'. It has elements of satire, comedy, scifi, drama, romance, mecha, and some other things that humanity has yet to name. It also has the best soundtrack and possibly the best artwork I've seen in a series so far, even though it was made several years ago. Despite the never-ending flow of random insanity, it has a surprisingly deep plot that can be interpreted any number of ways. Six episodes may seem like too few, but it definitely gets it's point across in that amount of time. I would recommend this series to anyone that has the slightest Interest in anime, and even to those who don't.",1139875200,,728,4.5227272727272725
1661980,5,B00005TPKX,"I first saw FLCL at the recommendation of a friend of mine. He showed the episodes all out of order, confusing me even more than I would have been anyway. Let that stand as the one irrefutable aspect of this anime--- it is REALLY weird. You have to watch the episodes multiple times to even get the faintest idea what's going on, and even then, there will probably be a lot you don't understand. This anime is fortunate enough to have a lot of the Japanese Culture jokes left in, confusing the crap out of most American viewers. I say fortunately because anime is like orange juice, it's best ""Simply unfooled around with"". But even with its random sense of humor, its bizzare characters, and even if piecing together the plot is like nailing jello to a tree, there is something transcendent about the feel of the series that makes you want to figure it out, want to put the plot together, want to fall in love with the characters (I certainly did). You want to dive into this series, like you want to be with someone you love. Everybody at some point has had a song come on the radio, and you feel an undeniable instinct to get up and dance. You become devoted, addicted, enraptured with that song. That's exactly what this series is like. You laugh, you cry, you get pumped, you laugh harder, you feel heartbreak and anger and joy and above all, exhilaration. In the same way that the Great rock albums of my time have changed me, so has FLCL. You will not regret watching, and you will not regret owning, this series.",1134691200,4,1520,4.451612903225806
1661981,5,B00005TPKX,"This series must get an award for simple originality. None of the characters follow the same anime stereotypes we've come to know as anime fans. The conflict is everchanging but never out of reach. You always know what is going on, in other words. And to add to that, it has a great J-pop soundtrack.

The series (even though I have only seen the one episode) is ground-breaking. The animation is beautifully drawn, the charcters are great, and the plot...well...there is none!

It has many elements to draw in a variety of people; action, romance, aliens.  The amazing animation is greater than you'll get from any other cut-rate anime, almos movie quality. One warning; don't come looking for a plot, because while it's there, it's merely a formality.",1127433600,3,396,4.642857142857143

FLCL is one of those anime that gives you the urge to whatch it over and over. The Pillows are the best next to L'Arc~en~Ciel!!! So check out this DVD and don't forget about the music!!",1126569600,3,364,4.2
1661995,4,B00005TPKX,"Yes, FLCL is a strange anime. It's not every day that you don't see a kid who has robots popping out of his head or see a crazy girl who uses her guitar as a weapon. The characters are truly unique and very enjoyable to anyone looking to watch something different. The animation is decent, not spectacular but the show shines during the action-packed fight scenes.

The show feels rather dark, though, and each episode can stand on its on since they all have a little side story. All of the characters are mysterious. One girl says she's an alien, and the boy supposedly has no brain. Some have done awful things in the past. It made my head spin trying to figure out what was all going on and why.

Unfortunately, this strange confusion was a little painful in the first episode and in the fourth. All of the characters and major landmarks were being thrown in without enough explanation. Also, the first episode contains a terrible segment in which instead of showing animation, they just dash the camera all over the manga comic. It was painful to the eyes. The first episode was so stand-offish to me, I thought the whole show was going to be dumb. Fortunately, I watched the next episode and saw a 180 degree turn. The fourth episode is similiar to the fourth far as being confusing since more new characters are being thrown in.

I really enjoyed this anime and would suggest it to any one who wants something different from what's out there now. I do have one warning, though- the show almost passed the red line far as adult content. If that sort of stuff gets under your skin, then you might want to pass on this.",1124928000,3,1622,4.472972972972973

And, what's more, she pulls all kinds of stuff from Takkun's empty head!  FLCL is one of the more bizarre animes out there.  That's not to say it's bad.  Far from it.  It's wonderfully animated and has decent voice acting (at least that's my opionion).

you get that funny feeling in your stomach and you feel like

running about 31 miles? Well, I'm sure you don't, but this is one of those shows. Fooly Cooly centers around Naota, an 12-year old boy living in the small town of Mabase. He has a 17-year old girl always making out with him, an alien maid who hits him with a bass guitar, at which point robots start popping out of his head. One of the robots, Canti, is revered by Samejima Mamimi (said 17-year old) as the god of dark flame. Also, there is a robotic father, eyebrows made out of nori, and a medical device factory that is actually a giant iron that is going to flatten out the wrinkles to everybody's brain. Or something like that. Trust me, it is much more complicated than all that, but it's okay, since Fooly Cooly is far more character driven and much less plot driven than most anime. This is made all the more startling by the complex plot and manic pacing, which take a backseat to the beautiful dramatic scenes, which carry haunting messages about growing up and finding ones' self. The contrast between these two elements of the show creates a unique and powerful effect. Or maybe I'm just thinking too hard. But the power and beauty of the show are enhanced even further by the awesome japanese rock soundtrack, courtesy of the pillows. As all of this is going on, Fooly Cooly still manages to throw in some pretty clever anime satire.

Although it will run you at least $70, the benefit of having a six-part miniseries on three dvds is that you must take time to examine every facet of every episode before moving on, which is quite handy since Foolyclimax is arguably the best 23 minutes in the history of animation, and should not be overlooked without insight.",1121990400,4,1797,4.506134969325154

FLCL is simply one of the most insane, fast paced animes you will ever see, and the more you watch it, the deeper you will realize it goes.

The problem with this, however, is that the series is only six episodes long.  Each one of these FLCL DVDs contains only TWO episodes, when they could have EASILY put all 6 onto one disc.

At first glance it makes absolutely no sense, but after a few viewings (OK, thirty viewings) it all falls into place and makes perfect sense. The show's stream-of-conciousness style means that nothing is really explained, it's all simply put right in front of you and relies on you to put everything together. Of course, many animes are all about visuals. This one manages to pack in some of the best visuals I've ever seen in an anime and still manage to have a good story (as well as lush cinematogrophy which comes off perfectly on the DVD) and a pounding camp-tacular soundtrack by Japanese cult band The Pillows.

1662003,5,B00005TPKX,"FLCL is an anime show that shines over all that the anime world has ever known.(with the exeption of Love Hina) You may walk away from this show scratching your head the first few times around but stick with it, it'll be worth your while.(if you get bored watch girl-guy circumstances, that'll teach you bordom!)(I'm talking about the whole 6 show DVD, this 1 only gives you 2 shows for 30 bucks, go to anime expo or an explicit anime store and get all 6 episodes on one 15 dollar DVD!)

The show starts with a young, depressed, confused, 12 year old boy named Noata(means truth in Japanese)Nandaba in Mabase, Japan.

He hates imatture adults, which makes him a hipocrite because he initially spends all his time with Samagima Mamimi, who is an immature, moronic 19 year old woman.  All of a sudden one day a wierd, inexplicably georgeous woman just pops out of nowhere on a usako bike.(vespa(moterbike)) She hits Noata on the forehead REALLY hard apparently looking for something.

Indeed, that night he has a rather obnoxious huge bump on his head. Out of this bump pops a robot with weird powers.( yeah weird,like the rest of the show)The mysterious womon appears again, and POW, konks the robot on the back of the head and his powers go away. So you want truly weird,........ this woman decides to live with Noata and his dad.(Noata has no mom??????)

She embarases herself all over the place, and finally tells a fake name which she goes by till episode 5, haruko. Episode 2 was all talk and an evil robot for all of 3 min. My favorite episode was episode 3.( mostly cause it had Eri Ninamori, the character my girlfriend Heather voiced.) In this episode which was mostly talk FLCL shows Noata having feelings for Eri(who goes to elementary school with him for gods sake) and then after episode 3 eri has basicly no part.

Episode 4 was auesome when Noata saves the city and the show is finally explained, but that was it.

Episode 5 Haruko (now raharoo) goes to bed with Noatas dad, but was episode 5.

Episode 6 was pro! Kootos to Gainax! All action, Noata fights Haruko, and this machine named terminal core dukes it out with robot man noata and haruko!(HALLAGHUYAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

1662014,5,B00005TPKX,"I suppose if your big brother went off to a foreign country, his girlfriend began to flirt with you, and a crazy woman smacked you with a large guitar, it'd be hysterical. At least, that's what Gainax's FLCL (Fooly Cooly) makes us believe.

Noata is a young boy in a small town. His brother has left for America to play baseball, and his 16 year old girlfriend Minami is making plays at Noata. And out of the blue, a woman riding a motorcycle hits him with her motorcycle. To say anymore is give away the entire plot.

The series is confusing, as it has the official Gainax's stamp of strange. Yet the series is not suppose to have an in-depth plot that Eva or Lain had. While many fans complain of FLCL's incoherantness, the reviewer would like to point out that it was made that way. FLCL is a strange mix of stunning animation, and random humor done in such a way that the audience is laughing, in confusion, but still laughing.

Not exactly for kids, it has sexual references, but in such a way that it's not a sick joke, it's a funny laughing-out-loud type of humor. There's plenty of large flying robots, visual jokes, and random humor to keep one on their toes. The music is outstanding, as The Pillows can do no wrong with their lyrics of grungy hamsters, snipers, and lobsters.

What sets FLCL apart from the other anime? What makes it such a cult-spawning series? Why in the world does it not make sense? (The answer: no one knows.) There's just something about the series, an enigmatic, What-The-Hell-Was-That type of feeling that's akin to falling in love. You're not sure why, but it's good.

It is impossible to explain the story of it all--- I've watched it several times, and only have theories about what this story is trying to tell us all. This truly is something you cannot pass!

However...

I see that most agree with me that this deal is extremely pricy. It would be a waste to buy just one or two of the DVD's, and all three get to about 70 bucks. The show is so worth it, though. If people continue to get cheap bootleg copies, you really aren't acknowledging Gainax or any of the people that made this unbelievable anime.

1662017,4,B00005TPKX,"Friends turned me on to this a couple of years ago, its the best anime in memory, and reinvigorates my interest in the genre.  Nothing since has touched its perfection.  Short and sweet, spastic as hell, and the dynamics between the characters are bombastic.  Its pretty much a distillation and collage of everything in anime since the 90's hit, a punk-rocking parody that suddenly begins to take itself seriously, then upheaves everything.

  If you take away all the religious underpinnings and focused on Shinji's sexual tension with older/younger women in all twenty-six+ episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, but shoved that in only six episodes, and stuck said confused pubescent boy with the ""worst girl for you at the best time"" you've pretty much got the narrative.  Soundtrack by the PILLOWS alone makes it a classic, like a J-pop PIXIES.

  I give the series itself 5 stars, but the American DVDs just aren't worth the extra cash, so I had to knock it down to 4.  The American dub sucks, the bonuses aren't that great, and you're ending up paying from $75 - $90 for only 2.5 hours of content.  ""Lord of the Rings:Return of the King"" is longer than the whole series combined and costs only $30!  I'm tired of supporting anime companies who finally DO release this stateside only to be jerked around by my wallet.  I could ALMOST understand 2 volumes at that price since the series narrative naturally splits at the middle anyways...  but its still a MUST SEE.

  I recommend getting a used copy if you can't afford the steep tag.

Ive seen countless anime in my 16 years of living, and none have kept me this entertained and can be this enjoyable. To many, if yovue seen the show you may be wondering, what the heck? I was to, but it does make alot of sense when you slowly come to relize what the show tries to teach you, like animated poetry almost. Keep your eyes and ears open cause you wanna pay very close attention to enjoy this anime! Ill start with animation, if youve seen the show then you know by now the animation and effects are unrivaled... and for those who haven't seen it, its going to blow you away. The creators who created the hit series Neon Genisus or to the more hardcore fans ""EVA"", used many animation styles in the show that do make you wonder, but its appreciated and crazy. As for story, like I said pay extra close attention, I had to watch the series twice before I relized the moral, and I won't spoil it for you, when it hits you its a great moment. Theres complaints of only 6 episodes and 2 mangas but thats all it needs to tell the story, and the animation, the characters, and the story are literally so enjoyable Ive watched this DVD 3 times in the last week. You always notice something you didn't catch before, which sometimes is a gag or something that gives you a clearer look on character relations and story tie ins. The Characters in the show are some of the best, each with a diffrent and unique personality that makes you even more attached to the series. If you wanna start a new series for your anime collection or just don't know what to watch, take it from a manga lover and hardcore anime fan, this is the best (In my opinion) anime ever created.

Being as short as this series is (6 episodes over 3 DVDs), there's not too much explaining regarding backstory or how things came to be.  Despite the lack of explanation, this is one of the best animes I've encountered in a while.  The animation is very well done and the characters are very likeable.

The basis of the story revolves around the coming of age/sexual blossoming of a young boy. yeah, sounds like it might be cutesy and big-eyed girl anime,...not a f-ing chance. The robots, aliens, mysterious corporation, arsonist girl, hilarious sexual jokes, and above all an awesome soundtrack (thepillows rock!). I'm not going to go into any more specifics, because this is truely a series to be watched. If I were to try and explain this show based off storyline or who the characters are you would lose the main point. The symbols and artwork are amazing and exterely deep. Certain things are left alone and you never really know what they are...well they are hinted at but not completely explained. You are asked to draw your own conclusions, which makes this series a different experience from person to person. My friends and I have had a couple very in deoth discussions on the show and many things could be debated many ways...ok well enough of this talk..let me go on.

  The first time I saw an episode (number 1 actually)on cartoon network, I was completely comfused and preplexed. It seemed insane and japanese, but i wanted more. The more I watched the episodes the more I liked the insanity and the more the insanity made sense. If you aren't up for symbollic, artsy, and humorous anime  you'll have to watch over and over (like thats a bad thing) then this isn't for you, but if you take the time to watch this series you will see one of the best anime series that I've ever seen. The more i watch it the more i like it. Yeah its weird and there are robots spouting out of a kids head, a moped riding alien rock queen, and you never really are told what furi kuri (aka fooly cooly, aka flcl) is....but with stories and animation like this who really cares.

1662035,5,B00005TPKX,"The series is beautifully animated, funny, touching, Benny-Hill suggestive in spots, and *weird*. All works of fiction have some symbolism flying around, but it's usually something you've seen before, so you pick up on it. Apparantly the creator took all the established symbols, said ""Feh!"", and came up with his own toys. Cynicism is represented by thick fake eyebrows, a factory shaped like a steam iron threatens conformity, electric guitars are power objects, and every time someone gets ticked off a giant robot comes out of their head. God, the property damage.

The basic plotline is not very complicated--you take this repressed kid with a boring life, who can't see anything interesting in his existence, who does not in fact *want* anything interesting to happen because that would involve change, and suddenly you dump a ton of weird events on him. If it were a fantasy story it would start with an elven chick riding up on her elven steed, knighting Joe Protagonist with a magic sword and calling him to deeds of derring-do which he is not really up for. Instead, the writer decided to have an alien chick run him over with a Vespa and brain the kid with an electric guitar. Why? To open up the interdimensional gateway in his head. Oh yeah.

There's a recurring theme of kids acting like adults because they think it makes them look cool, and adults doing the reverse for the same reason; and the idea that to live life, you have to do the Le Mat jump; step off the edge, look stupid if you have to, make mistakes, stop trying to be in control of everything. Pretending that you're above it all is cheating.

My hair stands up when I watch the last episode. Who can deny the wondefulness of a battle fought with glowing electric guitars? ""It's...it's...the 1961 Gibson EB-Zero!"" AND he gets a Flying V in his other hand. Damn, I want to be a Pirate Lord.

1662038,5,B00005TPKX,"Whew. Gainax really outdid themselves with FLCL. This is one of the most random and completely Dadaist things I've ever witnessed. Seriously. This makes other off-the-wall anime I've seen (Elf Princess Rane, Excel Saga) seem downright pedestrian by comparison. Okay, maybe not Excel Saga, since that's pretty insane in of itself, but FLCL is quite different from that, and still pretty ""wha?"" inducing.
Beyond that claim, pinning an accurate description to this anime is extremely difficult, but I'll give it my best shot anyway. Is FLCL a comedy? At its core, I think it is--there are a lot of humourous sight gags, one-liners, and a conucopia of inside jokes (many of which even I haven't deciphered yet) along with a lot of stuff that's just plain incomprehensible. But there's more to it than comedy. It's initiation story, drama, parody, and action all rolled into one package...and then promptly injected with some seriously psychotropic substances.
Just when you think it's going to start making sense, FLCL laughs in your face and throws enough bizarre dialogue and imagery at you to make your brain hurt for days. And yet, there IS a story, and some sense of logic...though an alien one. I've seen all six episodes three times (once with a serious caffiene bender), and I'm still trying make sense of it all.
Needless to say, the characters are a little more than slightly off the beaten path. The boy Naota is the most normal of the lot; he acts much like an average small-town prepubescent boy...until giant robots start sprouting out of his head for no apparent reason. Mamimi, girlfriend to Naota's older brother (who we never see in the series), is just your typical homeless chain-smoking teenage girl with a facination for fire. But the most inspired character is Haruko--a pink-haired alien woman with a penchant for whacking things with her bass guitar/chainsaw hybrid, generating mass carnage with her Vespa scooter, and alternating between cute and completely deranged in a split second. The two women act as a sort of foil to Naota, influencing his development and character (it relates to the initiation story aspect). Freud would have a field day with some of the psychological symbolism on display here.
If that wasn't enough to chew on, also add a giant factory that looks like a clothing iron; Naota's bizarre dad and hentai grandfather; giant monster battles; a school play; gobs of fan service and innuendo; a walking TV set; and enough pop culture references and in-jokes to make Quentin Tarantino green with envy.
The character designs and art are gorgeous, and the animation quality and production values are consistently high (not to mention as schizophrenic as the storyline). FLCL is one of the most beautiful anime I've seen in quite awhile; it compares favorably with other recent high-quality productions, and surpasses a good deal of them. And to top it all off, it's got great music courtesy of J-Rock band The Pillows, who are kind of like a Japanese version of The Pixies (I am searching for the soundtrack as of the typing of this review). Gainax put a ton of work into this and it shows. The dub acting is great, and I actually prefer it to the subtitles. The liner notes even elaborate on some of the more peculiarly Japanese in-jokes, which eases the ""WTF?!?"" factor slightly.
Too bad that the cost per DVD is somewhat exorbitant (25 bucks for two episodes--ouch), and the whole thing only lasts 3 hours, though I doubt you will find a more action-packed and thought-provoking 3 hours anywhere. All and all, any experienced anime viewer (if your only previous anime experience is Dragonball Z, you may not want to jump into this right away) needs to check out FLCL. It's one of the most original viewing experiences ever, and deserves my highest reccommendation.",1088985600,33,3807,4.931464174454828

It's lower in quality and buying bootlegs of anime that is already released in America only serves to jack up the price of the official releases.  Trust me, supply and demand, if people are willing to pay for the official releases the prices will go down, but if they keep bootlegging released material it never will.
BTW, the series is great, and if you don't want to or aren't willing to pop for the $75 for the series, either wait for it to air on Cartoon Network again, find an anime rental store (they do exist), or pester Netflix to carry them.",1088035200,3,673,4.291338582677166

STOP!!!
This is a VERY good series but this is RIDICULOUSLY (sp?) overpriced! I would go to an anime store, such as [...] where you can buy the ENTIRE series (all 6 episodes, not just 2 like on these DVDs) for $10.99 plus $6.00 S&H. So...
$75 for all 3 dvds...

about $17?

12-year-old Naota leads a very strange life surrounded by some very strange people.  His brother's ex-girlfriend is a chain-smoking arsonist, his father is a mudslinging propagandist, and his grandfather has a habit of sending the family robot down to the corner store to purchase ""adult literature"".  Situations constantly waver between psychotic and surreal, quickly unfolding beneath the gaze of a factory shaped like an iron.  Add enough puberty related symbolism to make Freud's head explode and you have a truly original, if not linear, anime.
The quality of the artwork, including both backgrounds and animation, is topnotch.  The soundtrack is equally good, scored by the underrated J-rock band, The Pillows.
The only reason I'm giving FLCL four out of five stars is because I think the two episodes per disc in a three volume series is a total rip-off.  Here's an idea: release all six episodes on one dvd with an additional cd containing the soundtrack and various audio promo clips.  Just an idea.",1086307200,,1186,5.151041666666667

If you have only seen it once, you're probably thinking ""That made absolutely no sense"" and you're not far off. It can take a few viewings to catch all the details and random jokes. It's worth it. Even if you don't like anime, don't knock it without seeing it thrice (once to view it, once to catch what you missed and once to enjoy it). I hate most anime, but this is my favorite show.
If you haven't seen it and are interested but don't know what its about, FLCL is the story of a normal boy (Naota) who has loads of chicks all over him and robots coming out of his head. One of the females seemingly interested in this twelve year old is an alien who hit him periodically in the head with a Rickenbacker bass. It is a great, funny, short show.

I have only been attempting to watch it for about a year now, so my knowledge on the subject is limited at best; ""Cowboy Bebop"" and ""Spirited Away""  and Cartoon Network/Adult Swim shows being pretty much it for me. So I can't speak with any real authority here.
So I followed a friend's advice and watched ""FLCL"". I think this was some sort of cruel joke; my friend must have really wanted to hurt my brain. He succeeded.
""FLCL"", or ""Furi Kuri"" or ""Fooly Cooly"", has to be the most jarring, weirdest, loudest, freakiest, unsettling, confusing, strangest, most twisted piece of eye-crossing, retna-burning, sense-assulting film, let alone anime, that I have ever laid my eyes on.

1662056,5,B00005TPKX,"Simply great. FLCL's random kookynes and unique animation style are simply enticing. But beyond the shell of a wild Japanese Comedy, FLCL is really just a story of growing up, its also a story of the same ol same ol being turned upside down by a new character, or a Deus Ex Machina, coming into some ones life, and changing it forever. The show balances the undertones of Growing up and Comedy perfectly, in fact, if you wanted you could study this anime and see the theme about matruing and growing up.
But I do have one problem. Two episodes a disc. Its quite a lot, and FLCL will certianly turn certian crowds away, so I suguest thinking this over before getting it, unless you saw it on Adult swim and liked it a lot, or saw it fansubed.",1084320000,2,741,4.338129496402877

Rock and Roll is an intuitive, wild, careening, sexy, weepy shake, rattle and roll spirit that ducks and dodges definition.  It could be music, or a film; it could be something totally ephemeral and evocative, like an old motorcycle jacket with an empty cigarette pack in the pocket.
Fooly Cooly is Rock and Roll.
The animation is excellent. The total lack of stylist boundaries is hysterical, and the art direction is paradoxically spot on. This is definitely a labor of love. Somebody got a long leash and a supervisor on vacation to make this wonderful craziness.  I think had about as much fun watching it as they did making it.",1083369600,3,704,4.715447154471545

It mocks your senses at every turn with it's superior animation, awesome soundtrack (performed by the Pillows), unique premise, and multitudes of subliminal messages.
Just what is FLCL? Difficult to say. A few of the main themes I've been able to grasp include: relationship of older girls towards younger boys, kids existing in an adult-oriented world, middle-school life, living in the shadows of those who came before you... and that's just one episode worth. FLCL greatly benefits from repetetive viewing. I've personally watched each episode about 20 times, and I still fail to grasp the full ideas it presents.
If you tear away at the pretty pictures it throws at you, and look into the deeper messages it presents, it will indefinately change the way you look at the world. If you don't, then your still left with a witty satire of adolescence and adulthood.",1082505600,2,983,4.927710843373494

1662070,5,B00005TPKX,"As most of the reviews have stated, I too agree FLCL to be the greatest Anime Ever. If not, then why would I be writing this review? Anime had a slow start and then rocketed into mass popularity. However alot of Animes seemed to be all the same. Fooly Cooly is anything but the same. Fooly Cooly is a ""Different"" Anime. The General thought of ""Anime People"" is that they're usally weird or immature, because they are into more adult oriented power-packed cartoons. But I believe Fooly Cooly fans to be of a higher standard than that. Fooly Cooly presents itself as shady and confusing. Thats good, it makes us think. Fooly Cooly isn't just handed to you for you to enjoy, you are given someting to think about. It is not just swordfights and explosions. It is like comparing a deep and inriguing novel to a children's Short story. There is just no comparison. Fooly Cooly is most simply put as a different Anime, one for the more CONSCIOUS Anime fanatic; not for the CREDULOUS one.",1079827200,,981,4.548022598870056
1662071,5,B00005TPKX,"Some of the best work in a genre comes when it satirizes itself.  Anime is noted for many things, dramatic (and over-dramatic) plots, silliness in the face of disaster, haphazard development, even an excess of pompousness, but very rarely is it self aware.  For the most part anime is written for the fans of anime, not the fans of the fans of anime, e.g., the people who create it.  FLCL is a celebration of the humorous aspects of anime - and a brilliant success.
FLCL, however, undertakes to be a well (and outrageously) written satire on the entire alien girl sub-genre as well as a perfect example of its type.  These are the stories where an unsuspecting adolescent boy suddenly finds himself inextricable entwined with a beautiful alien (or robot) woman, who overturns his life, continually embarrasses him, and loves him without any regard to his obvious flaws.  In a way she (in this case Haruko) is the perfect foil for the insecurities of a young man - forward where he is afraid, and forgiving wwhen he makes mistakes.
Poor Naota not only has his older brother's girlfriend (Mamimi) making overtures to him, but Haruka the space girl appears, runs him over with her Vespa, and then moves into his household as a maid.  Surrounded by beautiful older women, it would be easy to envy Naoto if it weren't for the robots that start growing out of his head.  And Haruka's habit of swatting him with a bass guitar.  And Mamimi's fascination with fire.
No, it's not really supposed to make any sense.  Instead, enjoy it for the ribald puns and dialog, the countless 'in-joke' references to Japanese popular culture, and its irreverent experimentation with its media.  The collaboration team that created FLCL (or Fooly Cooly) is composed of Gainax's best artists and writers.  The level of professionalism is what makes all the crazy parts fit together, leaving the viewer staring wide-eyed at the screen waiting for the next impossible setup,
While the first two episodes contain nothing so blatant as to be offensive, there is a high level of fan service that runs throughout the series.  Gainax has chosen not to pursue a rating for FLCL.  Most teenagers should be mature enough to handle the innuendo, though.  And, honestly, I haven't seen a film that was this much pure fun in quite a while.",1078531200,83,2301,4.792405063291139

You can't jump in to the deep end because your expectations will be extremely high if you ever find yourself about to watch animes that are not as ambitious as ""Ghost In The Shell"". And starting in too shallow (ie: Pokemon) will set you up for not taking the time out for the more artful animes (the ones that are ""too weird to watch"").
A great comedy and silly mecha style anime. It doesn't take itself too seriously. The Pillows are now one of my favorite bands, even though I have no idea what they're saying (Japanese is not even my 10th language). 5 stars.

1662076,5,B00005TPKX,"One of the things I really enjoy about anime is the markedly different structure from that of American animation.  Anime can be quirky, stylistically diverse, poignant and pointless all at the same time and still tell a pretty good story.  There also is an artistry employed in anime production that you just don't see in any but the most slick American 'toons. FLCL ranks as one of the most entertaining animes I have ever seen for all of these reasons.  It is incredibly quirky, very funny, visually astounding and surprisingly insightful. In addition to the usual giant robots and sci-fi elements, the series manages to do a very nice study of the angst of an adolescent boy, and explores the semi-innocent sensuality of youth while maintaining a manic pace. While the usual brilliant studies in form, movement and color are nicely placed, the series sometimes dissolves into moronic slapstick gags and Southpark-style animation that serve to add hilarity throughout the set.

1662088,5,B00005TPKX,"This is probably the most refreshing anime I have ever seen.  What attracts me to it the most is the shift from the quasi-superstitious science fiction of most anime to the avant garde symbolism and abstract philosophy that greatly reflects the writing of William S. Burroughs (interesting side note: in one episode Haruko mentions ""Naked Lunch"", Burroughs most famous book.)  The influence of the ""Cut-Up"" writing technique pioneered by Burroughs makes itself very evident in FLCL.  There are many other aspects of this film that make it great, but I chose to focus on Burroughs.

1662090,3,B00005TPKX,"This is a title you'll either love or hate. It all depends on whether you can associate it to your youth (or everyday life).
Basically, FLCL is a psychosexual trip through the life of a 12-year-old boy. His insecurities and difficulties are mixed in with science fiction and robot battles to create sort of an unusual mesh.
You don't really need to understand this show to enjoy it, you just need to understand what Naota, the main character, is going through.
The humor that is constantly mentioned is a bit painful given the underlying story beneath it. A boy's admiration for his brother turning into hatred and disgust, an abandoned girl clinging to his image, a father getting together with a new woman without concern for his son's feelings. These are some of the underlying concepts. The whole story is riddled with angst.
I say rent if you can --- but if you can't - you could make poorer mistakes than purchasing this show. Watch it, and if you don't like it - you can always sell it. The box that is available with DVD Vol. 3 is a collector's item.",1071014400,4,1058,4.544502617801047

The voices are very well done. The music is great. The characters are endearing and charismatic. The art varies from extremely detailed revealing detailed expression and emotion that is a triumph in animation to simpler forms remeniscent of other older Japanese cartoons that I'm not so fond of.
I like the first two episodes best because they focus more on the characters and less on action. Parts are laugh-out-loud funny. The concepts upon which this show is based make you truly question the sanity of its creators.

I'm not even sure why i haven't seen anyone talk about the poor video quality throughout the six episodes, since it'd be near damn impossible for it to be ""just my disc"". There's two main problems i noticed that either span an entire episode, or affect a big chunk of it's running time. One is a horrible sharpness that creates blocky lines, rendering the animation something straight out of ms paint. The second being a blurred image, appearing as if a home vcr recording.
What really bothers me is that i'm quite sure i catched a glimpse of a few parts of FLCL when it aired (or might still be airing) on Cartoon Network, and i'm pretty sure CN's episodes were completely flawless.
It's a shame that FLCL fans have no other official alternative in the US. As is i dislike the idea of making the most out of a 6-episode series by releasing it in three separate DVDs, but the lack of respect for the fans shown in the quality of this product alone can definitely be considered the kick in the gonads.",1069804800,7,1081,4.49238578680203
1662094,5,B00005TPKX,"Weirdly beautiful, FLCL is to anime what James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" is to the English language: a combination of all conceivable styles produced by absolute masters; proving conclusively that pastiche, done right, can be a great art from. And FLCL is done right. The first thing people notice about FLCL is the style, or should I say, styles, as the animators at Studio IG combined every animation style that popped into their heads (including some childish and crude ones), added some brilliant innovations of their own, and assembled all so that every scene -- every scene -- has something weird, beautiful, quirky, striking, or all of the above.
The next thing you notice is the action: many scenes, especially the signature battles between robots and a crazy girl armed with a Rickenbacker bass guitar, are so frantic, frenetic, energetic and complex, that you really have to watch it over and over to understand what's going on. But never fear: FLCL is so much fun you'll ENJOY watching it over and over. (Buy it, don't rent it.) You have to trust me: with patience and attention you'll realize that there IS logic and continuity in this complex, multilayered tale.
Reviewers who say FLCL is incomprehensible are just wrong-- FLCL is very comprehensible, just too fast and complex for slower people. After you start to figure out the storyline, you can pay attention to the wonderful, hilarious characters and their relationships, which are beautiful and true. Although FLCL's action is hard to follow at first, and based on a couple of absurd premises, still, the characters react to these events in ways that are entirely truthful, given their personalities. Starting from the end of Episode 4 (there are two episodes per DVD), the writers show the relationships between the characters evolving in ways that, we realize later, are inevitable and true to how people really act. You have to respect the writers at GAINAX: these guys may be crazy, but (unlike Hollywood screenwriters) they in fact do have insights into human nature, and they show relationships evolving in realistic ways, no matter how absurd the robot battle scenes may be. Smart adults can enjoy this.
And as a bonus, the action scenes are livened by a really terrific rock'n'roll soundtrack by Japanese band the Pillows; the music is cut into the action onscreen with more skill than I've ever seen in any animation, resulting in action/music montages that blew me across the room.
The English dub, by the way, is excellent, the best English dub I've ever heard on any anime. No famous pretty actors, just great voices and a great translation. ""Ukelele no goood!"" I'm still laughing.
Emotionally repressed Naota, ditzy unstable Mamimi, crazy hot alien Haruko with her bass guitar, wannabe tough-guy Amarao, and horny hippie Kamon, are classic characters and you'll get a kick out of them all. Especially Amarao-- ""Those eyebrows!""

This review is coming from a recent convert to new anime (late twentieth century - early twenty first), so fanboys can skip over this slate of praise.  I'm a film fan.  Kubrick, Lynch, Gilliam... etc.  The folks at GAINAX floored me with this totally interpretive tale of boy meets bassist.  The animation style is varied and full of quirky homages of faves and influences ranging from Lupin III to South Park and many others in between that I'm sure I never caught.  The English voice cast is eerily in sync with the original Japanese.  The music, a la The Pillows is by far the best J-Rock soundtrack I've ever heard, evoking Pixies, Smiths and others.  Production value is consistent throughout the short six-episode series.  As far as the story goes, you'll probably be left wondering just what the hell happened to you, but that's not a bad thing.  This three-hour romp through an alternate reality is SUPPOSED to confuse while tackling coming-of-age issues, mild sexual tension and medical disorders that result in robots popping out of peoples' heads.  I can't call it weird, because the term seems crude in context.  Much the way dada should be appreciated in its  own context, FLCL should be approached with no expectations.  Let it take you for a ride.  Just don't be suprised if you're left hyperventilating and drooling on the couch afterward.  Doctor's reccomendation:  Watch it again.  Side effects:  Aversion (or attraction) to wandering housekeepers. :)",1069286400,2,1499,4.947791164658635
1662096,5,B00005TPKX,"For those of you who feel that by seeing the first episode, you have a pretty good grasp on an anime. This is not the case with FLCL. The plot is a twisting, rich, powerful story which will require you to see the whole series at least twice. The first time through, most people will become brainfried and decide that the director was on the shrooms. However on the second time through you will see a fascinating tale full to the brink with imagination. Lets divide this series into sections of strong points and weak points.
Plot: 5 stars- This is an amazing plot, but I've already babbled to much on this.
Graphics: 5 stars- The whole thing is beautifully done with delicate or crazy ( first and last episodes) colors and movement. When the animators put in South Park into it I was about to send him my college savings, it was brilliant.
Humor: 5 stars- Great sense of humor from every aspect. From sarcastic to ...another funny thing the humer is dead on for teens, not widdle kiddies.
Can't think of anything else: 5 stars- WOW. just wow. In my opinion ( which, by the way, has never helped anyone with anything) this is the greatest anime of all time. Save up and buy all three discs. You won't regret it.",1069113600,4,1210,4.430493273542601

To put it in a nutshell, this series is all MTV could have been if it weren't a commercial vehicle for second rate talent and brainwashing pre-teens with leftist garbage.  The sound track rocks, some of the visuals borrow from Pink Floyd; The Wall, and some of the most stunning ""camera"" movements are utilized.  The artwork quickly shifts from cartoony (including direct comic book stylization) to extreamly well drawn.  Even though a polar opposite, this is probably the best anime since Cowboy Beebop.

Haruko is a 19 year old member of the Space Police who comes to earth chasing a being composed entirely of energy known as Atomsk. Although she is a member of the space police, Haruko is very self centered and wishes to capture Atomsk so that she can consume his energy and steal his power ( Atomsk has enough power too steal planets). When she finds that he isn't on earth, she opens inter-dimensional transport waves in Naota (main character's) head by hitting him with a guitar. Transporting stuff across the galaxy is a huge gamble, but at the end of the first episode, Haruko manages to pull Atomsk out of Naota's head. Now Medical Mechanica, the space Police affiliates on earth, are trying to destroy Haruko and recpature Atomsk (who posses the robot known as Kanti). Below all this chaos is the story of Naota's coming of age.
THAT'S THE PLOT RIGHT THERE, PEOPLE!!!",1068508800,,1039,4.561497326203209

I've heard people say its about growing up, and I guess that's pretty much true, but the first time I saw it I was too busy trying to figure out what was going on.  After watching each of the 6 episodes more than 6 times to the point you can say the lines along with the characters, it doesn't lose its brilliance.  Its light and just entertaining to watch, the Pillows music is Awesome in itself. FLCL is one of my favorite animes (thought its too short!  *tear*)
I HIGHLY recommend it... especially to teenage anime-fanatics!

I love the characters in the show I simply love haruko shes a cuttie but sometimes shes out of control she wacks everybody in sight with her guitar in sight but enough about my faivorite character lets talk about FLCL its self. You see its about a boy named Naota where he has a normal every day life until something very wierd and amaizing happend he was walkin with his girlfriend when suddenly out of nowhere Haruko accidently bashed him with her motor scooter and then things get funny when Haruko thinks he's dead then this matrix cut scene comes in then a behind the scenes look when they were talking about the slowmotion scene then Naota was wiggiling then Haruko which I should of mentioned a long time ago that she finnaly stoped kissing him she then wacks him with her guitar then he turns all flat and stuff I can't go on about episode 1. And now for a different episode 3 and 5 before I continue this story I must warn you that these two episodes contain some mild violince and some sexual comedy mischief and in episode 5 there is brief nudeity so don't be shy just incase you guys outhere can't hanndle a little jokes in this show which I think you brave guys can. Now heres more funny stuff if your a big Lupin The Third fan like me then heres a secret scene for some fun anyway to see this familiar scene watch episode 5 then later on when you see Naota's dad trying to jump on Haruko for some fun if you know what I mean then a giant boxing gliove comes out and knocks him into the right into the wall just like the opening scene in the Lupin The Third series and also there was an elvis presleay impersonation in episode 5 and then there was Naota's father dressed up as a nazi pretty funny WWII joke and finaly there was the giant robot fight were this fived arm robot came out of Naota's head which this robot looked like a scene in Trigun the tatered up clothes type of scene well thats all I can think of well I hope you can hear from me again thanks for joinin me on this short story O YES for now on you can refer to me as Lupin The Third,Spike from CowboyBebop,Naota from FLCL,or as Vash The Stampede from Trigun you can call me any name from the cartoon series I don't mind really well once again I hope you enjoyed this story well as they use to say in CowboyBebop ''See you space cowboy''.

1662112,5,B00005TPKX,"FLCL, the latest anime series from GAINAX(the creators of Gunbuster and Evangelion), is a non-stop rock and roll rollercoaster ride for the human mind, connecting adolescence, aliens, alienation, boy-meets-girl stories, giant robots, growing up, sex, separation and that most elusive of all human desires: love.  And that, of course, is just the tip of the iceburg.  If you thought that there was nothing meaningful left in the world of japanese animation, then you must correct that error by watching this series.  It changes EVERYTHING.
Oh, and as for the DVD of Volume One itself, it is excellently produced.  Clear picture, great sound, nice extras(especially the director's commentary, which discusses aspects of FLCL's imagery), bi-lingual japanese and english vocal tracks(with a good english dub, even!), and liner notes in the booklet that discuss the more japanese in-jokes.  If all anime DVDs were this smoothly done, the world would be a much better place.  At least when it comes to cool japanimation, of course ;)
So in closing, this DVD is most DEFINATELY worth your time, as is the rest of the series.  Run, don't walk, to get this as soon as you can.  You won't regret it one bit.
Hope my review has been helpful to you :)",1067299200,33,1239,4.951690821256038
1662113,5,B00005TPKX,"""FLCL"" (also called ""Fooly Cooly"" and ""Furi Kuri"") is quite possibly the worthiest of all animes to be called awesome to a fault. It is an unbelievable achievement for Gainax, makers of the legendary ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", another favorite among otaku (anime fans).
The story hinges around an 11-year-old boy named Naota and his brother's girlfriend Mamimi. He lives with his otaku dad (who wrote a book on ""The Philosophy of Eva""), his strange grandfather, and his incredibly fat cat. Naota lives in a town with a reputation for its ability to disregard oddities, such as the gigantic iron-shaped Medical Mechanica factory that spews out steam every day at the same time. Naota's life changes (and quite drastically) with the arrival of a 20-year-old girl named Haruhara Haruko, who rides a Vespa, carries a bass guitar with a pull-cord and a motor, and claims to be an alien detective. In just a few days, he goes from having an ordinary school-kid's life to being quite used to having robots come out of his forehead.
""FLCL"" is a series that, despite having been thrown together as a side project of Gainax used for two purposes (to siphon off excess ideas and blow off steam), has not yet failed to wow anyone I know who has seen it. The animation is incredible, the humor is right on target, the story is amazing, and these factors together qualify it as the king, nay, the Supreme Overlord, Emperor and Omnipotent Deity of all anime.
The art for ""FLCL"" was an experiment in a new genre. Most anime is a hybrid, principally drawn by hand, with a lot of the animation and some of the effects added by computer. ""FLCL"" was drawn and animated entirely by computer, but this came out great. Although some scenes may be a bit choppy, the art certainly makes up for it.
""FLCL"" was an incredibly funny series, with two scenes drawn in manga, the graphic-novel form of anime, and a constant barrage of amusing one-liners. Half of one episode is just transitioning from spoof to spoof as it makes fun of such anime standards as ""Lupin the 3rd"" and ""Gundam,"" as well as a scene in construction-paper animation reminiscent of ""South Park."" The characters are terrific, 'nuff said.
The biggest problem with ""FLCL"", as with most anime, is that it is extremely expensive. ""FLCL,"" however, is even more so than normal. At $25 per volume and only two episodes on each, you pay more than $75 for a series of only six episodes. The fact that it is unbelievably good certainly compensates for this, I shelled out $75 my self, but ""FLCL"" was expensive even for anime.
At this point there are only two things left to say: 1) BUY ALL THREE DVDs OF ""FLCL"" RIGHT NOW! and 2) eyebrows....*

A girl rides up and makes a dent in his forehead which grows into a horn, which becomes a robot. And he still says that! Outrageous! There are two points where the media style completely changes for no apparent reason.  The first one is when the protagonist is dead, and she gives him CPR, and the main scene windows while the characters critique it.  The second is when they convert an entire scene to manga.  And the dialogue is pretty ridiculous: during this manga sequence his parents discuss sexual jargon with him (even though they have no idea what the words mean) concerning this new girl, and his old girlfriend type thing says that she'll overflow if she doesn't kiss him about once a day (and means it).",1066608000,,817,4.575342465753424
1662126,5,B00005TPKX,"Hmmm, what can I say that hasn't already been said? I was lucky (or unlucky?) enough to have my anime cherry popped by this wonder (with the exceptions of fast-food anime like Voltron or the Transformers...hey I was a kid during the 80s). Up until that point I kind of just skirted around the subject.
  Then I watched FLCL and I was amazed. I'm a formally trained designer, steeped in 2D design, critical theory, computer visuals, blah, blah, blah. All that hit the fan when I saw this series for the first time. I saw someone's imagination, someone's dreams sitting raw on the screen, with all the subtleness of a memory that was spawned in your own head.
  To those who might have had a hard time with a few things:
1. Plot - sure a big part of any story and this is no exception. It's there and so well crafted it's hard to see. As in James Joyce's (no comparison here really, I know but follow me) Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man some things cannot be necessarily put to paper, rather they need to be shown. The series is not fettered with useless grandstanding, overemoting, and the usual in your face ""THIS IS THE WAY IT IS!"" As someone pointed out, it's about growing up...you try and rationalize that.
2. Art -  The color pallet is understated, subtle in most cases, which makes it craftful. It doesn't burn onto your retina, it flows. The art, as so many others have pointed out, is almost without parallel. It's crisp.
3. And finally all the drivel about psychology. Sure, sure it's there, but d**n it, it's in every part of life! The true failing of any psychoanalytical viewpoint is it always fails to see any JOY in anything.
Watch this series, enjoy this series, buy this series from Amazon because we love and cherish them, and remember: ""I'm going to tell you this story the way I remember it, not necessarily the way it happened.""",1063929600,4,1853,4.470414201183432
1662127,5,B00005TPKX,"I'll dispense with the plot summaries and just say that this is a coming-of-age type story with several twists that make it amusing.  It's not for everybody, but it is on par with Bebop and Evangelion for me in terms of intricate plot and superior animation.  It's for fun, not for serious purposes.  I mean, c'mon, when was the last time a plot involved a kid getting whacked on the head with a guitar held by a Vespa-driving alien?  That alone should make it amusing.
My advice is to watch it several times, because i taped it from Adult Swim before buying the DVDs because I couldn't understand it the first run through.  The characters are very unique for me, particularly Samajimi Mamimi (sp?), who is the most intriguing of the series, and who I remember the best of all.  It addresses a lot of things about small town life that ring true with me (""every day spent living here is like a lifetime of dying slowly"", or something like that), and so I am appreciative of efforts to make things like this in new formats.
Plus the animation references, from Looney Tunes to Lupin the 3rd to South Park, were brilliant.
That's about it.  See if you can find it for rent if you're not sure on yet.  If you look for the connections between the episodes you'll see it's not as incoherent as some of the more impatient reviewers may have indicated.",1063497600,2,1343,4.475409836065574
1662128,5,B00005TPKX,"Simply the most amazing piece of artwork ever developed.  From the stylized use of digitized manga to the amazing group of animators that worked on the projects.  Tsurumaki's vision and depth is amazing (especially since he is right handed).  Oh, and don't forget the amazing fight scenes with some of the most fantastic robots you can imagine.
Watch as Naota finds his way from elementary school to adulthood with the help of Haruko and fights his way through his own feelings to discover that he should just be himself.  On the path he has to fight his way through a myriad of amazing Medical Mechanicca robots.
Even though each disk is only 2 episodes, there is also an hour of commentary from Tsurumaki (director) that is nearly as riveting as the show itself.  Also, a LOT of the nuances in the show are directed at Japanese culture and the anime biz.  Even if you don't understand it all until afterwards, it is still an amazing show.
Buy all 3 of them right now, because you will be begging for more the moment it ends.",1063411200,,1026,4.548913043478261
1662129,5,B00005TPKX,"I absolutely love this series.  FLCL combines great Japanese rock, a unique story, and experimental animation to create an anime experience unlike anything I've ever seen.  The story is really hard to summarize here because it is so unusual.
Naota is a twelve year old boy who's life is depressingly ordinary.  Until he has a close encounter with a mysterious woman riding a yellow Vespa SS 180 and weilding an Azureglo Rickenbacker 4001 bass guitar.  It isn't long until strange robotic monstrosities are shooting out of his head.  Like I said, the story is unusual.  And unless you buy the other two DVDs, you will be left scratching your head, but if you do decide to purchase the whopping six-episode series(which unfortunetly will set you back about 90 bucks), you will be extremely glad you did.
Most if not all of the music is from a japanese band called The Pillows.  The music is amazing, and is really the glue that holds the whole thing together.  It wouldn't be half as good without the soundtrack it has.
The animation is superb, and involves quite a lot of cinematography with usually one ""bullet-time"" 3D scene per episode.  As I said, this is experimental.  So experimental that it switches from anime to manga(comic) form for about 5 minutes in the first episode, which I love, but other people hate.
In a related note, the case for the anime is great.  It includes a booklet that not only explains all of the anime inside jokes, and japanese pop culture references(which FLCL is full of), but provides insight into the making of the anime, and also includes a printed version of the previously mentioned manga that the show turns into for a period of time.  There is also a full commentary with the director if your into that.  It's in Japanese of course with subtitles.
This anime is not for everyone.  For example, if you did not like Evangelion because it was too crazy, this probably isn't for you. Oh yeah, this anime is CRAZY.  It moves very fast and you won't be able to understand anything unless you see all six episodes.  But I highly recommend this Anime for anyone with an open mind who can appreciate trying new things.",1062633600,,2150,4.663129973474801
1662130,5,B00005TPKX,"The first time I saw this on Cartoon Network, I thought 'Man, this is so dumb.  What the HECK is happening?  What a load of nonsense.'
Then, I saw another episode.  After it, I said, out-loud to myself, 'Well, that ain't so bad.  Kinda fun to watch.
Watched again, and I applauded the show's greatness.  My oppinion of the show went up from there.
What is it?  It's a comedy, an action show, a romance, an anime with one of the greatest soundtracks I'VE ever heard.  After seeing every episode, I'll still buy the DVDs, because each new viewing give you more insight into the subtley and power of this anime.  Yeah, it's pretty short.  But it packs more greatness into six episodes than most animes pack into TWENTY-six.
And no, I still don't fully understand it.  But I think, that is one of the greatest things about it.  It lets you understand it however you want.  I bet that different people see the show differently, love it for different reasons, and all see it through their own eyes and mind.",1062460800,,1001,4.469613259668508
1662131,5,B00005TPKX,"Furi Kuri? FLCL? Fooly Cooly?
Please.  There's no ""L"" in the Japanese language, so ""FoolyCooly"" and ""FuriKuri"" are basically the same thing.  Don't like ""Foooooly Coooooly""?  Then pronounce it like a Japanese person, don't lengthen the vowels, and put equal stress on all the syllables.  EASY AS THAT!
Oh, by the way... This seriously kicks butt.  The first time you see it... Don't try and make sense of it, just watch it.  You'll hurt yourself trying to cram it all into your head the first time.  After two times through the series, it starts to make sense in a very non-sensical way.
This's been dubbed (VERY well, I might add) by the folks at AdultSwim on Cartoon Network, with only ONE edit.  They broadcast it twice, for about three weeks.  If you missed it, then, well, look hard enough, you might be able to find it in English.  Try KaZaa or some such thing.  Maybe someday it'll end up on DVD, too.",1062115200,,908,4.54320987654321
1662132,5,B00005TPKX,"Really, there are two ways to look at FLCL...
You can look at it as the rollercoaster satire of animes, something that goes from making fun of Lupin III to having their way with John Woo. It's Woo-tastic!
You can look at it as one of the hardest storylines to follow I have yet to encounter. Otakus of the world unite! We'll figure it out someday! Once again, it's fun to watch as the characters even make fun of their own anime. Subtle isn't a word you would expect to hear about an anime like this one, but the movements from hilarity to serious storytelling are definately cast in slow shades of gray.
Foolly Coolly (or FuriKuri or my favorite, Foo Li Coo Li)? You never REALLY find out what it means, it's a state of mind.",1061769600,,726,4.306569343065694
1662133,5,B00005TPKX,"FLCL is IT! Never have I seen such an insane scenes, themes, and story line. The best part is that even if you don't get it, you can still LYAO at their great sense of humor. Furthermore, the music by Pillow is nothing short of excellence, adding even more greatness to this series. I think everyone agrees on one down side; only six episodes. Fear not. There's enough story line to fill an entire season (26 episodes). It's just so fast faced to catch it all in one breath. U just gotta watch it over and over again. Trust me. You wouldn't mind doing that.",1061596800,,557,4.314285714285714
1662134,5,B00005TPKX,"Having the itch to draw from the age of about 5 or 6, I was always searching for good stories in comix and artists that presented me with something real. Ralph Bakshi ripped off some really good work with ""Wizards"" which was a play on Japanimation (as it was then known...) and Vaughn Bode's characters 'Cheech Wizard' and 'Cobalt-60'. Bode along with Russ Manning who drew 'Magnus Robot Fighter', was my cartooning hero. And was one of the most prolific cartoonists of the hip generation. Bakshi's work is like a wet dream compared to the work of the folks at Gainax... I got into anime really strong a few years back with Tenchi Muyo. It hooked me. And then there was 'Ghost in the Shell' and 'Akira' and of course 'Cowboy Bebop' and its art and music nailed me down. And Devil Hunter Yokho, and Record of Lodoss War and Outlaw Star and NeoRanga... and and...
But then I finally got to view ""Furi Kuri"", (which most folks call 'Fooly Cooly', just need to buy the 4 CD set of 'Teach yourself Japanese') and I fell in love with animation and character creation all over again! It was like 1971 and the hip commune of the 'Finial House' where we did art and zines,.. the rips on all the different cartoon and anime series (like South Park, and Lupin the 3rd ...they also take on Bode see if you can find it!)... the basic  story of a young boy coming of age, the 'romantic' thread is really well done (Alas, Haruka-san!.. I knew her well!) And the Sci-Fi... hey what can I say, if they had an award for best supporting actress in an anime role there is one character it would have to go to,..quoth she, ""Those eyebrows!"". Furi Kuri is an avant garde classic in my judgement.
Furi Kuri is a work of Art all around!
What Yoko Kanno did for Cowboy Bebop with jazz, the Pillows do for Furi Kuri with rock!
As was stated by another reviewer: It isn't generally speaking, for those that have no anime background... however that isn't true in all respects! If you want something that will make you think, that will make you remember, that will make you wonder that will make you laugh 'til you wet or that can just blow your socks off with REALLY DYNAMITE ANIME, FLCL is your anime!

  I am certain that there are a lot of pre-teens who are watching FLCL right now with a mixture of horror and awe pasted on their faces.  What others have written is indeed true - FLCL is a unique, wondrous and utterly shocking anime series which boasts what is arguably the best soundtrack of any series yet released in the states.
  It uses MTV-style animation and editing to tell a tale that is more implication and metaphor than actual plot - although there is a plot once the whole is digested.  It is essentially a coming-of-age story - or perhaps a coming-of-puberty story with a near-continual stream of sexual innuendo and imagery.  Taken at its rapid-eye-movement, face value, the story is exciting, confusing and fairly chaste.  Considered after two or three viewings, it grows horns, as it were.  What is FLCL really?... you be the judge.
  The DVDs are quite well made and more worth the cost than many.  The subtitling is large and bright enough to read - written in a good font.  The sound is superb, although this may be more the music than the actual sound quality.  This is a series that deserves to be watched more than once, unlike many others.  In fact, it must be watched more than once.  Probably not a good gift from your parents, but worth a purchase.",1061251200,,1346,4.616033755274262

After one episode, I was absoloutly hooked.  Despite the fact that it's kinda' confusing and u have to be paying close attention to figure things out, it makes this... deep connection with viewers.  The characters are deep, and they develop beautifully throughout the story.  Action?  oh yeah, it's got that, and all fight scenes are EXCELLENT.  Add lots and lots and lots of comedy, and many self references, and there you go.  But, I feel like I'm forgetting something... oh yeah, some of the best art I've seen in an anime... ever.

ACTION: Great! Some of it is really fake, but with this kind of show I wouldn't change a thing. The digital animation aids in this a lot, helping the makers add slow mo, complete with 3d bullets.
COMEDY: Also great. I love how people can get brutally masacared and live through it. LOL. If you don't understand anime, this will be different. Furi Kuri is much more American style than some anime.
PLOT: Wierd, you will be thrown off at first, but information revealed later will explain to you some of the previous events. Overall it has an amazing and original plot with no lack of creativity.
CHARACTERS: Also great. All the characters are developed well and have extremely different and unique personalities.
SOUND: Perfect! The weapon sounds sound especially awesome, and the voice actors were perfect matches, making it even more lifelike.
MUSIC: Waaaaaaaaayyy better than most anime. Performed by ""The Pillows"", Though in japanese this alternative/punk rock music was like... MTV in japanese. They sound like American people singing in Japanese.",1060473600,,1246,5.112745098039215

If you haven't watched much anime, then I strongly recommend you buy some of the other popular anime series first - otherwise you won't get as much out of this.
I know that sounds almost elitist, but take it from a guy who may have already ""ruined"" anime for his girlfriend :)  Even if this is your first anime series, you'll probably enjoy it as long as you like off-the-wall story lines.  However, as many other reviewers point out, this series has layers upon layers of outstanding attributes - from the seamless transition between drawing styles to the recycling of anime cliches into almost a best-of-breed exposition of each one.  If you haven't watched at least one anime series before, you just won't grok that the cliches _are_ cliches, etc.  Seriously, just watch at least ONE other series first (I recommend Tenchi Universe as the most versatile and universally appealing introduction into decent anime).
OK, back to the DVD at hand.  I won't say much about the story cuz there are a ton of other reviews here that provide those details quite well.  However, I WILL point out the things that got me hooked:
(I) Soundtrack absolutely rocks.  I'm actually heading out the door after this review to Japantown and Chinatown in SF to look for a copy.
(II) The artistic quality of the animation approaches sublime.  It's a short series, and maybe that explains how they could commit themselves to making every frame - EVERY FRAME - equally well done.  Coloring, shading, perspective, and most importantly movement are all expressed masterfully.
(III) The whole package (story, soundtrack, artwork) will hook you into watching this at least 10 times.  You watch it once and love it, and you immediately feel like watching it again so you can catch all the details you noticed and vanished so quickly.
(IV) The story has action, a little touch of mecha, and some excellent portrayals of angst-pounding ... tension.  And not about overly gratuitous ... situations, they're about the sickeningly haunting kind of crushes you had when you were just becoming a teen-ager (at least for guys).  The kind that isn't about running home and crying a lot and saying ""she's dreamy"" (12 year old guys don't do that), the kind that makes you act tough and like a jerk until you embarass yourself, the kind that makes you want a girl to fall in love with you, not because you're ""sexy"", but because you're her hero.  Episodes 3 and 4 nail this to perfection.
(V) You will abosolutely love the fact that you bought the DVD and didn't just tape it from TV.  The DVD format allows you to sharply pause and slow-motion through scenes so you can catch all the details, and also so you can jump around till you figure out the plot :)
That last point goes back to my original comment - if you're an anime fan, you'll probably become engrossed enough to do stuff like frame-advance through the really short scenese.  And again, even in the sub-second scenes the artwork is flawless.
I've enjoyed a lot of other series that are also quite popular in the US: DBZ, Trigun, the 3 Tenchi series, the umpteen Gundam series, Robotech, etc. even that Voltron [stuff] from when I was a kid.  If you liked any of that stuff, I can't imagine how you could NOT love this series - it's everything you love about anime and its done to perfection...",1060387200,2,3355,4.680272108843537
1662143,5,B00005TPKX,"The first thing i noticed about the series FLCL (aka fooly cooly or furikuri) is that it is very strange. i have watched a lot of anime, but i have ever seen anything quite like FLCL. It is stylish and creative, and is not like anything else.
The whole story revolves around a boy named Naota and his life changing with the arrival of a mysterious alien named Haruko. the anime is full of lot of funny people and dialogue, that u will have 2 see 2 believe. The story gets very crazy and almost unbelieveable but is good through the whole 6 episode series. The story's insane plot will keep anyone hooked!
The series has a gr8 music by the pillows (check out their cd's-they r good!) The music suites the series well and even people who do not like rock music will probably like it.
A lot of people will probably like this series if they give it a try. it is an addicting and amazing series to good to pass up!",1060300800,,909,4.2298850574712645

It is an almost enlightened use of animation, with dead on blending of the different styles. I also must add that I completely agree that the FuriKuri is definitely a better title than Fooly Cooly.
The soundtrack is the best I've ever heard for a show and even the closing credits, with it's use of still frame, blends in perfectly.
If you don't get much out of my review I'd recommend you read the previous review of Mr. Richard Wood, he captured it dead on.

Heart? Charisma? All of the above?

1662167,5,B00005TPKX,"""FLCL"" has plenty of buzz going for it, mainly amongst the American anime fan base.  Studio Gainax let a lot of people down with the end of Evangelion, myself included, but good word abounds about this latest release.
It took me awhile to get into it, but when I did, I was hooked hard.  Weird, wild and fun, ""FLCL"" is a bit like ""Lain"" as a wacky screwball comedy.  The story is a bizarre cross-mix of Gainax references, esoteric gobledy gook, coming-of-age romance, and all of the other oddball junk found in fringe Japanese animation.  Someone more-than-familiar with Studio Gainax's other works will get greater pleasure from the storyline.
The animation is awesome, and is a real selling point for the strange storyline.  Lots of innovation, different techniques, and is a real envelope-pusher in the world of animation.
A great start to an interesting looking series.  I can't wait to check out the other DVDs.",1059177600,3,916,4.877419354838709
1662168,5,B00005TPKX,"Ahh, what to say about this one... Let me begin by saying FLCL is the strangest, most hyperkinetic, amazing anime ever.  Just as a reference point for all those familiar with the anime genre, FLCL's director (Kazuya Tsurumaki) worked with Hideaki Anno on The End of Evangelion.  And that one was an atomic bomb of sheer beauty and insanity (though it had its share of artistic pretensions).  Of course, End of Evangelion [upset] a lot of fans who weren't looking for deep and ""didn't get it"" (though what they were supposed to get is still up for debate).  With FLCL, don't worry about deep, just try to keep up.  FLCL is nothing short of a popculture masterpiece, with major ingredients including: Japan's typical Western-culture-in-a-blender approach, lightspeed editing obviously influenced by the ADD generation, a hefty dose of insanity, and its own idiosyncratic presentation style (the manga-style action sequences, etc.).  The Pillows provide a rock soundtrack so catchy it will make its way onto many a playlist.
Above all, FLCL is fun!  Be warned: this one defies typical genre categorization.  It combines elements of action, comedy,  drama (and what might pass for romance), albeit with a larger emphasis on the first two.  Personally, I believe that in this anime more emphasis is placed on style, though the plot is still absolutely whacked-out and wonderful in a ""i'm not quite sure what just happened, but I love it"" kind of way.
The only sort-of drawback: FLCL is short (six episodes).  Part of me wishes it were longer, only because I found it so amazing.  The other part of me realizes that it was made as a sort of exhibition of Kazuya's talent, and that it might have been toned down or ruined by filler episodes had it become a long-term project.
A few final words: FLCL is a phenomenon.  Many people who find themselves attracted to the stranger side of Japanese culture will be blown away by this anime, whereas people who will not enjoy it include those who are unable to release their grip on reality for the span of 3 hours.  So if you're feeling adventuresome, regardless of how you feel towards anime in general, check this one out.  You will not regret it.",1056240000,7,2186,4.807486631016043
1662169,5,B00005TPKX,"Do you consider yourself a connoisseur of anime? The classics are great, and the new stuff is impressive- but rarely more than eyecandy or 'coolness' factor. Stray from the beaten path of obvious plot. Challenge yourself: Visit an art museum. Go to a poetry reading. Experience something without understanding it, then explore it till you do. Watch FLCL. The first episode I watched, I was entranced. What is this? what on earth am I watching, why is it so beautiful? It felt like experiencing the depths of love for the first time. It's playfully innocent, questionably deep, and sexual in the most curious way. You want to be there, you don't want it to end. You want to show your friends, have them see the beauty- but like art, not everyone has the time or the intention to understand. Like Naota says, Nothing out of the ordinary happens. I think some people choose to think that way. To those who are willing to step beyond the bounds of commonality, prepare to experience something beautiful.",1052611200,13,999,4.747126436781609

Instead i am going to talk about the ENGLISH version of this. I've got several bad fansubs and HK imports of this and I was worried about how the english dub was doing to come out.
Surfice to say, the dub is amazing! It's the best dub i've seen in a LONG time. Most complanies just pick a voice actor and they read the lines and it sounds horrible (pioneer and ADV come to mind...). But this company took the time to get the inflections and the little nuances down-pat! They even chose voice actors who were not ""famous"" but SOUNDED the part!
Also, despite only having 2 episodes of the 6, the DVD has an audio comentary by the director (in japanese with subs) who explains some of the nonsense. Also the dvd comes with a booklet with alot of information about japanese culture which greatly helps first time viewers. (i wish i had that book the first time i saw this series... whoooo!)
Finally i'd like to add that the band which plays all the music in the series is AWSOME! I strongly advise buying the FLCL soundtrack done by ""the pillows."" They have some GREAT music.

I don't have a massive anime collection or a particularly long list of anime I have seen, but FLCL, from the moment I walked into my friend's room during the middle of the ""manga scene"" in the first episode, seemed fantastic and utterly new to me.  Therefore, I cannot comment with either the erudition of those who say that it fair though common or of  those that praise it for its wink-wink humor based  on reference to elder anime.  Regardless,  I recommend this anime because it caught me offguard and surprised me with its beauty and confusion.
Question: When I play the DVD on my laptop, unlike any other DVD in my collection besides ""Castle of Cagliostro"", when characters, cars , robots, etc., move across the screen, they momentarily leave trails.

It's about Naota a young boy in school, Haruko the wildest maid ever lived and Mamimi a girl full of thoughts.
In FLCL anything can happen. Like a gigant robot pops out of your forehead, a maid from space, a human bullet.
I loved this action/comedy for it's great non-sense, wacky and weird story. Beatiful animation a colorful one with some outrageous scenes not bad, not bad at all. I really liked the character design it felt fresh, really good. It sort of feels like a music video, flashing mech fights to the beat of The Pillows (preforms most of the OST).

FLCL not only tells a simple comedy about a boy who is caught in the middle of a search for the most powerful force in the universe, but is also about this little boy's attempt at finding his way through life, and realizing that he doesn't necessarily have to follow in the path of one of his friends or family or even of a twenty year old woman claiming to be an alien, but he can find his own path, and that will be ever the more rewarding.",1041552000,4,783,4.326530612244898

In typical gainax fashion illinear storytelling, preteen erotica and pretensious psychobabble are par for the course. Comedy? It's not there. Sure there's something slapstick about a boy getting walloped by guitars, but every other joke falls embarassingly flat. Horny older men, a sexually disinterested young male lead, crazy randy chicks, adolescent wish fulfillment... sound like evangelion?

1662181,5,B00005TPKX,"Let me start off by saying that FLCL (pronounced ""Furi-Kuri"" or ""Fooly Cooly"") is not for everyone. Don't let this discourage you from buying this DVD. This first volume is anything but sensical and humorless. The first episode is a blazing barrage of off beat humor and crazy antics. FLCL is beatufully animated and the character designs are phoenominal. Through out the first half of the move I found myself confused, excited, and utterly enjoying myself while watching robots read 'hussler' magazine. In the opening sequence the camera pans out and a huge monolith in the shape or a cloths iron. It's this kind of whacked out animitation that makes FLCL wonderful. There are even giant mech robot fights that start when the main protagonist, Naota, has biomechanical robots spring from his forehead. While the first episode is a scream, the second dosen't foucus as much on the quirky humor than developing a plot (even if the plot maybe so out there it makes no sense when I try to think aobut it). And while it still maintains it's odd nature, i couldn't help but feel like the humor in the last 8 minutes or so felt forced. This isn't a bad thing though. The humor in the end didn't feel right because there was a heavily somber (but wierd as ever) mood and I couldn't help but care about the different characters in the situations. It's the mark of a good anime when you can't help but think about it for the next hour or so. When it ended i just kept wanting more, more, more FOOLY COOLY! So you're probably wondering as to why I gave FLCL five stars when the humor sometimes felt forced. Because that was just nit picking. This only stood out because the overall product was so good!! FLCL gets it's five stars for it's fun factor not for it's perfection. If you're even considering buying this anime, do it. You will not regret it, I promise.",1036800000,19,1852,4.564564564564565
1662182,5,B00005TPKX,"First off, FLCL (or furikuri), was directed by the animation director of Shinseki Evangelion. It was animated by Production IG and Gainax (the other two studios involved in Eva). Secondly, this was an OVA so it had a much higher budget than your average tv show...as a result the animation is really, really good. This is some of the nicest stuff I've seen in a few years...the movement, color and composition are really alive and kinetic...

The story is a little esoteric but if you stick with it, it all makes sense! There's also lots of humor to be had for those who know anime...lots of in jokes, references, etc...aka fairly standard for Gainax comedy stuff....this is sort of a scifi comedy meets the real world on speed?!!

As for the presentation...The mastering is impeccable! It looks better than the original Japanese versions! There is director's commentary, an art booklet, an extensive interview/translation guide, etc etc etc. Synch Point have done themselves proud with this release.

And that means something, because I've seen a LOT of anime. Having said that, FLCL isn't for everyone. It's very well animated, has a great soundtrack, engaging characters, and tons of energy, but it's pretty strange. If you're one of those people who loves ""weird"" anime, you'll probably love FLCL.

1662194,5,B00005TPKX,"So much better than previous Gainax efforts. They're proving themselves to be more than just big robots and bouncy girls. Everything that was great about the first half of Gunbuster and Evangelion (the humor and tongue-and-cheek attitude) and everything that was great about the last half of both (the actual content) without the downsides of either. Fooly Cooly (sorry, guy below me, but check out the final scene of the last episode) is easily some of the best anime out there, much less the best of what Gainax has to offer. The only concern is the cost. Anime has a lot going against it value-wise anyway, since it generally comes with few extras and contains less content for more money than other DVDs. However, FLCL really pushes things, by only giving up two 30 minute episodes for the same price as a The Big O disc (3 episodes) or a GTO disc (4 episodes). It's saving grace is the fact that it does, in fact, have plenty of extras, though none so enjoyable as Excel Saga's 'Pop Up Video'-style in-film linear notes.",1035244800,,1025,4.637362637362638
1662195,3,B00005TPKX,"I had heard some interesting things about FLCL and was anxious to check it out. The animation and screen graphics are of the higher quality, as the production value of this cartoon is wonderful. Plus they do some interesting shifts in visual style depending on the story point, which makes for more interesting viewing. For instance, to explain the whole ""FLCL"" thing, they jump to moving comics for the scene. It's fun stuff.
Storywise, there's some unique elements tossed in...particularly all the robots which emerge from our young protagonist's head (literally). But the narrative is not an easy one to follow...a lot of stuff is left unexplained on this first DVD, and the story moves at a somewhat disjointed clip.
As a new-comer, I'd say both the graphics and narrative lean towards the experimental with various levels of success. For the animation enthusiast, it's worth seeing. For someone with ""story"" solely in mind, you might find this frustrating. And if you're someone mainly interested in panty-shots of pouty, anime girls in private school uniforms, you won't be disappointed.",1035072000,,1093,5.146067415730337
1662196,5,B00005TPKX,"Studio Gainax has brought forth some of the best-known and best-loved anime ever made (Evangelion, Bubblegum Crisis, etc.).  Their latest creation is no exception...only now, you can add 'weirdest' to the dossier.
""FLCL"" (or ""Furi Kuri"", as its called in Japan) can best be described as...well, everything you could want in anime, I guess.  It's got cute female characters, giant robots, wicked vehicles, sick slapstick humor, and lots of action and explosions, all backdropped by a killer rock soundtrack (by the Pillows).  Sounds fun, right?  Well, careful what you hear...
Sure, it's got all that going for it, but that's only the beginning!  Let's see, one cute female's got a god fetish and is an alleged arsonist, and the other may or may not be an alien, drives a custom Vespa motorbike, and bashes said giant robots (and the preteen male lead) over the head with her Rickenbacker guitar.  Speaking of the preteen male lead, guess where the giant robots come from--his MELON!  That's right, literally straight out of the poor lad's head come these freakish battlebots for the sole purpose (at least for the moment) of beating the tar out of each other.  The winner gets to live at the boy's house with the weird alien girl and his wacked-out manga writer dad and grandpa!  And don't forget about the mysterious medical machine facility looming ominously on the edge of town (which is shaped like a giant clothes iron).
So what's FLCL about, really?  The correct answer is, who cares?!  Yeah, I'm sure there's a plot in there somewhere that will no doubt be developed as the series progresses, but for now, just sit back, take it all in, and prepare to hurt from laughing.  I'm not really expecting this series to make any sense (although I have this eerie feeling that by the time it's over, it will), but in this one rare instance, I really don't mind.

I am only going to tell you why it made me into a fan so fast: FLCL is sooo good at setting the mood that even though it was a short serie and not much time is there, one minute you were tensely watching giant robots fight, the next minute you were mesmorized by an emotional scene. The two just seems to FLOW into each other with hardly a hiccup. And THAT is praiseworthy.

A kid who grows horns and cat-ears (ep. 3) and has robots jump out of his head that eats him from time to time (just watch the series). Fantastic soundtrack provided by the pillows, and the guide to which songs were played where in the show (found in the liner notes of the DVD) is great. The crowning glory of this DVD has to be the transcription of the manga sequence from the show. The show changes style so many times, and makes so many jokes based off of homynyms and puns that the translation notes provided are a life-saver. The reversable cover art is a nice touch also. This is a great demented little series, and a must-see for all.
Cons: This DVD took FOREVER to get here. No one will have this problem anymore, since the DVD has been released and the supply is there. I ordered this back in February, when it was supposed to be released in late March, and I received it a week and a half ago. The release date was pushed back so many times, that I wonder if the other two discs are going to be released on time. That is the only concern I have about the other episodes.

The first 2 episodes introduce Naota, the protagonist, Haruko Haruhara, Mamimi, Canti (TV boy) the robot, Naota's father and some schoolmates.  This series has many interpretations, and is very difficult to understand, but this series has great comedy.

The characters are well developed and intriguing but the plot will leave you saying, ""What!?"" a couple of times. But once you are finished it all comes together.

It features the best soundtrack since Cowboy Bebop, which congruent with the visual eye-candy you will be astounded for hours! It is the best production from Gainax since Neon Genesis Evangelion.

1662204,5,B00005TPKX,"FLCL is simply the best anime ever.  A 6 episode series, it's less than 3 hours long in total, shorter than many movies.  I've read a review stating that watching FLCL is like falling in love for the first time again, and it's a great way to put it.  In summary, FLCL is a story about a 11 (I believe, may be 10) year old boy named Naota and his brother's strange girlfried named Mamimi, and what happens when they meet a strange 20-year old woman named Haruhara Haruko who claims to be an alien.
The first 2 episodes will confuse you, but will leave you curious.  Episode 3 is the weakest, and may draw some people away.  Episodes 4-6 are simply incredible, as we find out just what's up with Haruko and why it matters.  The climax in episode 6 is simply beautiful, stunning, moving.
As many people have said, FLCL is very confusing.  The confusion is not an especially frustrating type, because we understand what happened, but not always why.  But in the end, it's easy to see that it's more of a coming-of-age story than anything.  Some have raved about the soundtrack, and it indeed is great, the best in anime.  Most of the background music are rock songs by a band called The Pillows, and they are simply perfect for every scene they are in.  Every episode but ep3 has at least 2 scenes when I was simply in awe of how well music could fit with the scene.
When I think of FLCL, I think of it more as a beautiful piece of art that used anime as its medium, not the other way around.  FLCL doesn't really fit in any of the classic genres of anime, although the plot may.  I encourage anyone and everyone to see it in its full.",1028073600,113,1631,4.273615635179153
1662205,5,B00005TPKX,"Okay, this is a GREAT anime series, but that's besides the point.  I just wanted to mention several things:
1.  The guys at Gainax release TWO books of the artwork with the words ""Fooly Cooly"" used on the dust jackets.  So, this leads me to conclude two things.  First, there is no ""2 l's"" fact and second, that they intended to call it ""Fooly Cooly"" to begin with and it is not degrading.
2.  Kewl references to other anime/cartoons/movies.  Watch for a very amusing South Park spoof as well as a very stereotypical John Woo action scene spoof.  How about Daicon V?
3.  The Pillows rock!  I suggest everyone out there buy an album (or two!).  Great songs include: Kim Deal, Patricia, Blues Drive Monster, Skeleton Liar, Funny Bunny, Swanky Street, etc...  They've been around a heckuva long time and it's about time they were recognized for their talent.  Gainax rules for using The Pillows throughout FLCL.  If you don't like Japanese music, listen to Skeleton Liar.  It's in English, at least.

It's completely Gainax in that its unique, bizzare, funny, etc.  My favorite factor of it: ""Its cool"".  Not visually, but I was happy that they used hand drawn cells.  There are a couple ultimate scenes that just blew me away, like at the end of the 3rd episode or so (maraeba I think?).  The script was excellent, only to be topped by evangelion.

We (the club) viewed an excellent quality fan-sub based on the fact the this anime is created by the same folks who brought us Evangelion so expectations were high. This anime does not disappoint. The plot runs around like the main character on her vespa, forcing you to pay attention, laugh, and not always get it but laugh anyway. I mean, any story that is partially based on a giant steam iron (sorry no spoilers) has got to rate high on the insanity factor.  Another plus is the ... alternative rock soundtrack by a group known as the Pillows.  Not being a fan of alt-rock , I was won over by the raging guitar work and the way the soundtrack is used almost non-stop through the video. If you are looking for a story that goes from point A to point B with normal plot development then don't look at FLCL.  However, if you want a slam bang, ""what the heck just happened"" hard rocking joyride, then this anime is for you!!",1018828800,10,1088,4.371287128712871

I have watched FLCL at least 6 times and I have found something new in it each time.  You will never run out of things to think about with this series, if any series is worth buying, then this is it. The replay value of this anime is phenomenal.
  Some people may find FLCL challenging because you have to pay close attention in order to understand it AT ALL, but trust me, there's plenty there to be discovered if you only look for it. Besides that fact the show looks great and the soundtrack is excellent. The Pillows (ones we have to thank for most of the soundtrack) are now one of my favorite bands of all time.

1662210,5,B00005TPKX,"FLCL or Furikuri or (yes) Fooly Cooly (don't argue with me on this point, the Fooly Cooly title is on the episode itself INSIDE the show.)
Anyhow, Gainax has made lots of awesome series, Gunbuster, Nadia, Evangelion, His Her Circumstance (karekano-hilarious show btw), etc. This is their last masterpiece because Gainax has officially disbanded and this was their last ""show off"" piece. *2003 Update: Gainax has RE-banded (is there such word?) they were able to get some sponsors, and now their latest work Abenobashi Mahou Shotengai follows much of FLCL's wackiness, but this time with a full storyline that makes the wackiness actually make sense*
If you're into animation you'll love the different styles they ""mimic"" in some sequences, and a lot of movie/pop culture reference too (Vespa mopeds, Gibson's '57 Flying V, etc) The story is out of this world but I'll let you enjoy it without spoiling it. It's only 6 episodes, but if you want more you can always pick up the manga (japanese comics) which continues the story.
There aren't that many series that I'd recommend, but this is one of them. ...",1014249600,9,1105,4.9144385026737964
1662211,5,B00005TPKX,"Wow. I first watched all six episodes of FLCL fansubbed about a month ago and I am still in shock. Utterly amazing. Some of the funniest dialogue is crossed with dark, sometimes even disturbing imagery, with plenty of irony and even a little self-deprecating humour (poking fun at EVA - also by Gainax, Gundam, and other ""robot animes). Many styles of storytelling are utilized, including ""Manga-style"", which you will have to see to believe. =) All of these elements combine with an excellent J-pop/rock soundtrack by Japanese band The Pillows to make an excellent anime which rivals (and eventually overcomes) such great works of animation as Akira, and Perfect Blue. The work quickly ping-pongs back and forth between The Wall and Ranma 1/2 in it's style, and it's simultaneously frenetic and Kafkaesque. Wonderful, I can't say anything bad about this series. Oh, and for those of you who continue to doubt that FLCL means ""Fooly Cooly""; please stop making judgements without proof - it is based off of the English words Fooly and Cooly, although certainly the puns on ""kuri kuri"" (rub/stroke/squeeze) and ""kura kura"" (spin) are used often... Also, if you look really closely near the end of Episode 6 (the final episode) you can see a magazine featuring Mamimi's photo of Naota holding Haruko's/Rahal's bass, underneath which it says in English: ""Fooly Cooly?"". I believe the name, although remaining intentionally ambiguous and nonsensical throughout the anime, does make sense figuratively, as Naota becomes viewed as ""cool"" by his peers for controlling Canti and appearing to have two older girlfriends, and yet he is ultimately a fool, as he is taken advantage of (although certainly in the end, he overcomes his fears and feelings of inadequacy).
 Anyway, that's about it; I'm rambling now, so I'll stop. Great series, I can't reccomend it enough!

It is a very confusing anime, but somehow, that makes it all the more entertaining.  I have sat through the entire series something like 5 times, and I would do it again, because this is the BEST anime ever.  No contest.  The soundtrack by The Pillows rocks, too!

1662222,5,B00005TPKX,"You will be won over by FLCL's edgy, well developed characters. Or maybe you'll be won over by this anime's postmodern use of constant Japanese rock  that sounds a lot like Weezer. In fact its really interchangeable - try making a FLCL vs Weezer CD album if you have the mp3s.
Something that no one has commented on yet: This anime is controversial, and has many layers to it. I really wonder how they're planning to release an english version when so many of the jokes are played on the translation of Japanese to English. Take the name for example, translated E to J, does FLCL mean Fooly Cooly, Furi Kuri, Furry Curry, or what. If you've seen the series, then you know what I mean with all the curry eating in ep3. It gets perverted this way too, with blunt sexual jokes... which makes me wonder why this anime is listed with a PG rating. I hope nothing got lost in the translation.
Ill admit it.  I have watched FLCL straight through like 10 times in a single week. Its only a 6 part series, but Im glad its like that because the creators were able to put more time and detail into each. BTW everyone seems to like the South Park scene. The series gets a lot better than that.
Most importantly
This series has good replay value - each time you will see something new. If you enjoyed finding religious references in Evangelion, you will be challenged again in FLCL, except this time it is more historical and not as obvious. No one on the net seems to acknowledge this, and Im too lazy to make a webpage or FAQ how so. I think the only way to see for yourself is to get this anime.",1010361600,5,1584,4.294314381270903

The animation is high-quality, self-referential, and a mix of many, many different styles. It's funny, it's profound, it's riveting. The story is in turns confusing, insane, and clear. The clues are there, they're hidden well, and you won't work out what's going on until you've seen it all. And you won't want to stop watching until you know what's going on. And once you know what's going on, you'll watch it again just to make sure.
Manga-style animation. Bullet-time. Construction paper. Eva, Gundam, computer game references. Religion, teen angst, family problems, friendship, manipulation, love.
