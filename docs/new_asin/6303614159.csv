7852730,4,6303614159,"This movie was one of the first Hentai I've bought for myself [the general release again, of course].  I found this movie quite to my liking as a movie, but so much more could have been done with it.
As in many movies I've seen, we start out with an undersexed boy who has a crush [and a hard-on] for a classmate.  If it isn't his luck, he's got a ghost chasing after him, too.
Of course, as in many Hentai movies I've seen, there's sex that doesn't need to be there, but it is.  When he tells the girl he likes that a ghost is ""haunting"" him, she takes him to a medium.  Who knew that a medium would screw your brains out to ""exorcise"" a ghost.
For some reason, you see a lot of female underwear in this movie.  Heh, and I'm reviewing a Hentai and complaning.  I must be crazy.
Nevertheless, this is one of the well-drawn Hentai movies I've seen, and it's pretty funny too, if you actually pay attention to the plot.
""What, you mean there's a plot?""
Yes, Hentai movies do have a plot, but that's only if you look past the sex.
Anyway, if you're looking for a fun, ""action-filled"" Hentai flick, this is your movie.",977961600,5,1114,4.206572769953052

The story doesn't do much good if you're looking for great plots, But hell! the animation on Keisuke and the mysterious girl was brilliant.this anime  shouldn't be ignored.it's well worth your buck!",958003200,2,264,5.0
