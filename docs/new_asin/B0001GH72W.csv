8012211,2,B0001GH72W,Mr. Green spent a lot of time talking to the audience about religion.  The songs were short and infrequent.  This didn't have a concert feel because of so much talking.  I wouldn't purchase this DVD again or recommend it to anyone.,1464566400,,231,4.585365853658536

8012217,1,B0001GH72W,"If you are a true Al Green fan you will be extremely disappointed with this DVD.  Al spends 75% of the concert rambling on about nothing of importance, another 20% messing around with the audience and about 5% actually singing.  Don't waste your money! I only wish I could send it back and get a refund.",1178409600,22,303,4.392857142857143
