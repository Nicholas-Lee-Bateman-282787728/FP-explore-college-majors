6244381,5,B00HZMZ29U,"This Blu-ray has all three movies on one disc. Surprisingly they look pretty darn good. The compromise is in the lossless sound, as there is no  DTS HD-MA or TrueHD here, just Dolby Digital 5.1 for all three movies (though the case erroneously indicates 5.1 only for IKWYDLS). The sound is still effective. No extras or subtitles, just a main menu where you choose the movie you want to watch. I got this for When A Stranger Calls, as this it not previously released separately on Blu-ray, unlike the other two. Plus it is in the correct 2.35:1 aspect ratio on this disc unlike Vudu and Amazon Prime.",1477785600,4,600,4.555555555555555

6244386,4,B00HZMZ29U,"two decent films for one low price of $5 at Walmart.  Distributed by Mill Creek Entertainment, there were no special features or subtitles just the two films.  the disc loads up and you choose which movie you want to play.  both movies are on a single side of one disc.  the transfer wasn't that bad and I have no complaints considering I only paid $5. for that price it's a great buy.",1394150400,,385,4.305555555555555

8637596,5,B00HZMZ29U,"I really bought this for ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", but ""When a Stranger Calls"" is good too.  I bought this two movie set for only $4, so that's $2 a movie and well worth it for campy silly horror.  This is a very basic set that contains 2 discs, one for each movie.  There are no extras or anything on either disc.  No closed captioning either.  It's that basic.  It's just got the movies is all.  If that's all you need, then you'll be happy.

As for the movies themselves, ""IKWYDLS"", (sorry not writing it all out again), but that was a huge box office smash when it came out at the time.  It's all people we're talking about.  In hindsight, one might wonder why as it's not shakespeare or anything to write home about.  The writer Kevin Williamson wrote ""Scream"" which was fantastic and well written.  He followed it up with this one, which seems a little silly and ridiculous, but fun nevertheless.

What's kind of nostalgic watching this movie 20 years after it came out is the four lead actors were mostly unknown and starting out.  This was the first official blockbuster film for Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Phillippe, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Freddie Prinze Jr.  What's interesting about that is they all managed to enter into a career that has lasted, especially for Ryan Phillippe who evolved into a good actor in critically praised films.  Why that's interesting is because most teen horror flicks star mediocre to really bad actors who you never hear about again.  The four in this film display much better acting chops than their counterparts tend to do, which is also why it's not a surprise their careers have had momentum.  At the time, Jennifer Love Hewitt was the bigger star having been part of the popular TV series, ""Party of Five"".

As for ""When a Stranger Calls"", I had never seen it before, but I did see the original which is very scary.  This is a remake that is mediocre with so many issues, yet it's still an entertaining guilty pleasure.  The opening shot had high hopes.  It was creepy and eerie, but then it cuts to the teens.  The lead teen actor has no range.  I've never heard of her or seen her before.  The performance definitely didn't get her regular work.  She speaks.....super....slow.  Luckily, a good chunk of the film she's alone babysitting and no one to actually have lengthy dialogue with, otherwise the running time of this film would've doubled.  She didn't seem to be appropriately upset or show much emotion when you've got someone trying to kill you.  She should've studied Jodie Fosters performance in the Silence of the Lambs.  Still as I said, it was mindless entertainment regardless.  And I did enjoy it despite the criticisms.",1491868800,2,2694,4.6440677966101696
