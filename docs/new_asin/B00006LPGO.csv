This movie has it all: Samurais, ninjas, undead samurais, feminine looking wizards, chicks with Tengu strap-ons, hillarious script, more naked chicks, and even better===> a SEQUEL WITH MORE OF THE SAME!! On a more serious note, the budget, effects, action, and script are above par for other movies in this level. It's definetly not an AZUMI, but it is there with VERSUS. I really enjoyed these movies because they were different.",1465862400,,546,4.945652173913044
7972305,3,B00006LPGO,"The 1996 straight to video film adaption of Makai Tensho. This deluxe widescreen edition has both movies-samurai armageddon and jubeis revenge. Its what youd expect a straight to video film would be like, not that great and in this case really cheesy. Picture quality is passable, its clear and sharp enough but not HD.The fight scenes have some authenticity but they can be really lame and slow, but there are some great shots. If you're a fan of the story and really want to check it out then give it a shot if you don't care about high cost film production. The movie is  crappy but it has its moments. 2.7/5 stars",1348012800,,617,4.508928571428571
7972306,2,B00006LPGO,"I guess it's a movie, but boyo, it makes very little sense, the characters are seriously half-baked, and the ending seems like it just comes when they've run out of film.
It could be worse, though. It could have been a single still photograph of a stale pretzel.",1042243200,2,262,4.479166666666667
