7860049,1,6304052847,"Don't bother with this movie unless you want to see my ex-wife and child...It was originally titled ""Zeus"", due to Mr. PanAndreas's preoccupation with his Greek heritage and the legends that he grew up with, and his ego.  I believe this movie was voted one of the worst of all time, and I think, as someone who worked on it, I agree.  The Producer, Mr. PanAndreas still owes me for actors I cast in it, but he took a tricky turn and released it in Greece, so couldn't touch him.  My suggest:  Avoid this movie at all costs...actually, run if you see it anywhere!  The movie sucks, except for performances by my ex-wife June Wallace (Kean), and my son, who was far too young to know he was even being filmed.

This is my kind review by the way...I could be mean.
