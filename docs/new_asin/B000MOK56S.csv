8170402,1,B000MOK56S,"I was very excited to get this dvd and begin learning the techniques of long ball hitting.  Well, I received the dvd a few days ago and haven't been able to get it to work.  I've tried it in my blue ray, 3 different dvd players and 3 different pc's. The dvd will not load into any of these devices.  I'm going to have one of my geek friends check it out, otherwise I plan on returning it today for a replacement or refund.",1351728000,,422,4.0
8170403,5,B000MOK56S,"Mike Dunaway is an amazing golf long driver.  I've seen him hitting balls live & it's a wonder to behold.  Typical world-class long drivers are either gorillas or flexibility freaks; their techniques being unobtainable to most players.  Dunaway's power swing looks as effortless as a practice swing, yet the ball explodes like it was shot out of a cannon.  Its power is the result of well-engineered & efficient technique, not brute strength.  It can improve anyone's game.

His video is excellent, too.  It communicates his technique in a simple manner & there are lots of good camera angles of his swing.  I'd highly recommend it.",1295136000,3,632,4.9523809523809526
