2629083,5,B000H6SXUQ,"My two year old daughter loved this special episode of Blue's Clues. Nick Jr. doesn't show it on a regular basis, and she asks for it all the time, so I can't wait until it finally comes out on DVD! A great show including learning numbers, letters & colors, and Blue's new baby brother Sprinkles is too adorable!",1156809600,5,312,4.396551724137931
2629085,5,B000H6SXUQ,My daughter loves it she is learning so many things from the Blue's Room DVDs. I also like that they have more than one show on a disc.,1356912000,,135,3.857142857142857
2629086,5,B000H6SXUQ,"We love Blues Clues in our house. this was a nice addition to the others we own. I really liked the longer format and focus on alphabet, colors and numbers. Wish I had it a year ago when we were really working on the alphabet. I would recommend this movie.",1308441600,,256,4.14
2629087,5,B000H6SXUQ,"My son can't get enough, he watches the whole dvd participating in the adventure, is really fun, and at the same time teaches letters, colors and numbers, while searching for the gold clues.
It really get his attention, as an exmple in the visit to the numbers castle to open a door they need to do a clapping code, is so cute to see him clapping and counting.
I love it too!",1291593600,,375,4.222222222222222
2629088,5,B000H6SXUQ,Very cute video where Joe and Blue find the clues that lead them to his baby brother.  My children have enjoyed it.,1264982400,,115,4.2272727272727275
2629089,5,B000H6SXUQ,"My son loves Blue's Clues! We bought this for him because we are expecting another little boy very soon, and wanted to introduce the baby brother concept in a fun way.  He watched this movie all the time in the beginning, he has recently slowed down to once a week or so. He loves to interact with it. If your child loves Blue, they will like this movie!",1259539200,,354,4.205882352941177
2629090,5,B000H6SXUQ,This DVD is so cute.  It has a great song and my kids love watching it.  It is perfect for kids who are awaiting a new brother or sister.  My kids also like trains and this movie features Blue riding on a train.  I also like that it teaches ABC's.  It is one of our new favorite DVDs.,1236816000,3,284,3.8275862068965516
2629091,5,B000H6SXUQ,"My 4 year-old loves this movie. We rented it and ended up needing to buy it, she loved it that much. But more than being cute, I think it would be great for any Big-Brothers-,and Sisters-to-be, because it creates a sense of excitement and surprise for the upcoming arrival. The other episodes on the disc are good too, and follow in the same vein.",1220054400,3,347,4.4375
2629092,5,B000H6SXUQ,"My 3 year old son absolutely LOVES this episode! He was so excited about the ""golden thinking chair"" ... I've watched it with him numerous times, and it still makes me laugh. Of course, it never gets old with my son, he's watched it at least 20 times. The learning is top-notch with this one....with ABC's, numbers, shapes and colors. Definitely a must-have!!!!!",1214524800,3,362,4.761904761904762
2629093,5,B000H6SXUQ,"This was a birthday present for my two year old, but I think I might like it even more than he does.  Every time we watch it, I find it just as funny as he does (though for different reasons).  Joe saying the Golden Thinking Chair is the most beautiful thing he's ever seen; all of the songs.  Every time I hear the songs, I can't help but think that this is what would happen if you got The Who to write an episode of Blue's Clues (that's meant as a compliment to both franchises, of course).  I also like that the show hits on all kinds of concepts from letters to numbers to shapes.",1203897600,,585,4.060869565217391
2629094,5,B000H6SXUQ,"This is a cute story with lots of music.  My 4 and a half year old loves

2629103,5,B000H6SXUQ,My daughter is a big fan of Blue's room and Blue's Clues.  Even my 5 year son loves to watch it with his sister.,1168819200,,112,3.6666666666666665
2629104,5,B000H6SXUQ,"My two year old just loves this video. He spins and sings to all the songs and really enjoys himself. He loves Sprinkles! Who I must add, is adorable. This DVD will be a welcome addition to your child's collection",1168473600,,213,4.35
2629105,5,B000H6SXUQ,"I do Home Child Care, the kids watched this show on Nick Jr and loved it.

They wanted to watch it again,I knew at that time I had a problem, it was on TV. So, I searched Amazon and found it...Thank goodness!!! They love it!!!",1168473600,,226,4.022222222222222
2629106,4,B000H6SXUQ,"This Blue's Clues 10th year anniversary special is very cute! My 4 y.o. daughter loved the puppy that ended up being Blue's baby brother. However,  if your child only likes the newer Blue's Clues with Joe, be aware that the only episode on the DVD with Joe, is the first. The others have the old host Steve. The other episodes focus on family as well and are well done.",1168300800,,369,4.3478260869565215
2629107,5,B000H6SXUQ,"I think our children (2 and 4) love this video because of three main reasons:

- all the beautiful colors in the background,

- there is a train that transports Joe, Blues and Sprinklers between different lands (alphabet, numbers, colors, shapes), and

- because they're helping Sprinkles get his beautiful colorful spots!

I highly recomment this product, mainly because is helping our little ones practice and apply their knowledge with letters, numbers (there is even a simple addition included), colors (includes a mixing-colors event), and shapes (they build a boat using shapes).

Have fun!",1167782400,5,596,5.297872340425532
2629108,5,B000H6SXUQ,"Been a loyal fan of ""Blue's Clues"" for ten years? Then ""Meet Blue's Baby Brother"" is your reward. Or maybe you joined the party late, like I did. (I started watching around the time that Joe took over hosting duties.) That's okay too --- as long as you or your kids enjoy this show, then there's something here for you.

Yes --- this special features the Puppet Blue, but don't be alarmed. This special is just as much ""Blue's Clues"" as it is ""Blue's Room,"" if not more so. Joe is in the special throughout and we play our favorite game, but with a new twist --- this time, both Joe and Blue are searching for Gold Clues to find out who Blue's baby brother is. It's rather fun really --- Blue joins in the singing of the various songs and Blue's brother turns out to be really cool.

In this special, Joe and Blue skidoo into Puppyville to find Blue's baby brother. They have no idea who it could be and that's where the Gold Clues come in. But these Gold Clues aren't your standard clues --- we really have to help Joe and Blue with these, as they scurry around all over the place and are very hard to catch. Along the way, Joe and Blue discover a little white puppy named Sprinkles. He's a bit shy at first, but decides to join Joe and Blue on their quest. He finds that as he learns new things, he gains colored spots. The concepts in this are a bit more advanced then usual, which is only fitting. There's one point where basic addition is needed and there's also mixing colors and advanced shapes --- such as a crescent.

According to the packaging, this special teaches the following Learning Skills:

- Literacy and Communication

- Math Skills

- Color and Shape Recognition

- Problem Solving

- Social Skills

- Everything You've Ever Learned with Blue!

:) I really like that last one. This special is rewarding in other ways too --- it's packed full of references to various elements of the show. Keep your eye peeled to the background and other elements to catch references. For example --- the train in this special looks like Steve's crayon and features the original Handy-Dandy Notebook.

The DVD includes one special feature --- ""Blue's Big Sister Song."" It's nothing ultra-exciting, but it's not too bad. The DVD also includes two bonus classic Steve episodes --- ""The Baby's Here"" and ""What's New, Blue?"" Both of them fit well with the theme. The audio is Dolby Digital and the episodes include English close-captioning (but not subtitles.)",1164499200,13,2459,4.553287981859411
2629109,5,B000H6SXUQ,"I have to admit, I adore Sprinkles, too!

I love how Blue's Clues incorporates fun with learning to keep the kids' attentions. My daughter, 2 years old, enjoys it tremendously- always asking me where Blue's baby brother is. My son, who is 4, surprisingly enjoys this show as well. He is proud to spell P-U-P-P-Y all on his own, add (small) numbers, and loves to show his dad how to make two triangles from one square!

We watched in on Nick Jr, and waited for the DVD to come out. We are expecting the delivery any second now...",1163462400,,528,4.377551020408164
2629110,5,B000H6SXUQ,We watched this on Nickelodeon and luckily we got it on DVR.  The 2 year old watches it several times a week and my 9 year old loved it too.  We will definitely be buying it as soon as it comes out.,1158105600,,198,3.6904761904761907

8136971,5,B000H6SXUQ,"Puppy, puppy, puppy!

In this episode, Blue and Joe are in search of the missing baby brother to join the celebration in the entire Blue's Clues family. Adventures with alphabets, numbers, and colors are encountered along the way in Puppyville. Blue finally meets her baby brother after conquering the challenges that brought them together: from climbing rainbows to counting their way to the castle, thanks to Joe's help.

My two-year-old daughter had so much fun participating in learning the letters, shapes, colors, and numbers in this show. Toddlers can sing and dance to the upbeat music. After everything is put together, this colorful, well-guided, and engaging DVD is well worth the purchase.",1404086400,,701,5.25

As for me, the puppetry, plot, and music really remind me of obscure movies I used to watch as a kid. Also, it has taught him how to spell the word ""puppy"" and what 2 colors make purple. :)",1382054400,,317,3.96875
