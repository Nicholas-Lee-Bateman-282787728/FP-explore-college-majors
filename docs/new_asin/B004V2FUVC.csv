8442658,4,B004V2FUVC,Akhay Kumar is my favourite actor with no doubts. He has done many great films but made many hideous mistakes in the 90's. His biggest mistakes were the one's in 1997 but before that things were OK. This movie Sainik(Soldiers) is based on Akshay Kumar a soldier in war with some bad terrorists and he does a great entry at the beginning. The romantic scenes and the songs were OK not as bad as what came in the year 1997 for Akshay. Then Akshay risks his life and dies after the interval and after everyone gets to know boy does the movie get damn boring with everyone cry and pretend to be happy. That's the most bad thing about this movie but at the end when Akshay who was captured by the enemy who didn't die came back and everyone was happy an OK movie better than the 1997 crap Akshay gave us.,1306281600,,799,4.228758169934641
