7980220,3,B000089784,This is an ok movie. I wish that Lee appeared in more scenes. His drunken mantis fist is great. He only fights two times. The first is when he drinks wine with sam seed. That scene is worth the whole movie. The second is the last battle whis is nothing special. At least not better theb the drinking scene. This movie is filled with bad comedy. I fast forwarded it to the fight scenes.,1327017600,,385,4.216216216216216
7980221,5,B000089784,"This flick never stops for a breath between beat-downs.  Even though it is low-budget, the choreography of fight scenes is insane.",1168300800,,130,5.190476190476191
7980222,1,B000089784,"I bought this movie because I'm a huge fan of both Simon Yuen and Hwang Jang Lee and..I was horribly dissapointed.

Not because of the quality of the movie or the action, but because I couldn't watch it. This DVD features a code called 'Insta-Action' which cheerfully allows you to jump right to the action scenes..and you can't turn it off so far as I've been able to determine. So what you get is about ten minutes of movie..fight..fight..fight..fight..end of movie.

Videoasia should be ashamed of themselves. If you're a fan of Simon or Hwang, try and get the VHS version at your local Chinatown. Don't waste your money on this deplorable DVD.",1135900800,10,647,4.716814159292035
7980223,3,B000089784,"When you see a Yuen Woo Ping film, you can pretty much gaurantee that it will be entertaining. At least the fight scenes are. I actually have owned this film for about 6 years now on VHS, and the movie is good, but it can get corney at times (like the singing in the bank?!.) But all in all a pretty decient martial arts film. Sam the Seed plays the usual character, like in Drunkin Master and does a good job, even though it's noticalble that he is not doing the more difficult moves. Watch for when Sam the Seed and Crazy Legs are drinking tea together! To me, It was the highlight of the film. Very good choreography, thanks to Woo Ping, who is one of the most talented martial arts choreographer and director. The firmiliarness of the characters, the cornyness, the slow martial arts sequences, and the unfunny comedy make it an OK martial arts film. Apart from the tea drinking sequence, the film is nothing spectacular.",1080777600,3,925,4.479289940828402
7980224,5,B000089784,"WHen he first got drunk I literally exploded in my pants.  There was a scene where he got wasted and beat up this guy and it was great.  I paused the movie to take a shower and when I got back I watched it naked.  THen I turned it off and turned it back on, and put a towel on.",1054512000,4,277,3.5833333333333335
