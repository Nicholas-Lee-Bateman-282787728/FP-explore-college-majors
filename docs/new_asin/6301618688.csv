341825,5,6301618688,"You won't be able to stop laughing. It features two cops Muldoon (quiet and easy going) and Toody (talks too much). They are best friends who are opposites. They are always getting themselves involved in unusual and hilarious situations. I own the whole 8 Vol. set and won't part with mine. Good clean humor and fun for the entire family. Volume 1 has ""Who's For Swordfish? You won't belive what this pair will do for a day off to go fishing. The whole precinct is in chaos over schedule changes. ""Something Nice For Sol"" They can't make up their mind what to get for Sgt. Abrams 25th anniversary on the police force. When they decide, the real laughs begin. If you can only get one volume, this is a great choice.",1121040000,13,714,4.458015267175573
341826,5,6301618688,"Car 54, Where are you? is an extremely clever, absolutely hilarious sitcom about the misadventures of the officers in a mythical precinct in the Bronx circa 1961.
Vaudeville style humor and intelligent writing are the  trademarks of this series.
Fred (Herman Munster) Gwynne, and Joe E. Ross  are the stars.  Their contrasting personalities and intellects are the  central point of the humor.
The first episodes, (Vol. 1) are about the  funniest videos this fan has ever seen.  The staccato silliness, and the  absurd situations make for great 25 minute viewing.
Currently, Amazon  carries Vol. 1 - 6.  It would be a real treat to find the subsequent  seasons which added Al Lewis (Granpa Munster), and Larry Storch of ""F  Troop"" fame.  Lewis as one of the officers, and Storch as the town  drunk.
All in all, one could do a lot worse for $8.99.",918518400,25,845,4.784722222222222
341827,5,6301618688,Great show. I wish there were more than 2 seasons. I wish Amazon prime would offer season 2. I am not interested in getting Hulu just to get season 2.,1459209600,,150,4.033333333333333

341829,5,6301618688,"Really great sitcom w/unique character personalities; Nat Hiken was a comedic genius.
No doubt, Car 54 was a forerunner for Barney Miller; similar humor, but more sarcastic.
My only regret was there weren't more subsequent seasons, beyond their second.",1454976000,,252,5.487179487179487

341843,4,6301618688,"... just how much fun this series was. O.K., I was in sixth grade but I do remember some episodes. My wife never saw it and was laughing hysterically. I enjoy watching with iPhone in hand tuned to IMDb for all the 'rest of the story' info. That it only lasted two seasons is strange- it is much better than what is served up today. This show can indeed be considered ""Very Funny""! ",1401580800,,381,4.219178082191781

341845,5,6301618688,"Good and funny""clean"" comedy. Recorded and aired in the days when you did not have to worry about your kids being exposed to inappropriate bits, etc. It takes real talent to be so hilarious without adding off-color shock jokes.
