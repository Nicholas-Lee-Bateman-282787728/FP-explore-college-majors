Never asked the questions of WHY WHERE YOU MEETING UP WITH A STREET HUSTLER AT A HOTEL FOR??? Oh, no! It always the men's fault regardless... I think not! Many of these women know exactly what they are doing and use their addictions and kaniving ways to be seen as the victim. Pretty sure they where offered compensation for this stupidity of a film and spew out the ignorant rants they know the film makers want to hear. If the few women shown on this docu-propaganda film are victims, then so are the millions of people who have to wake up every morning to go to work in a job they hate yet have no choice on just so the government can tax half their pay away to then give it for free to these scum bags this propaganda films calls victims! Why didn't they interview the hundreds of self employed adult workers in Nevada where its legal? Why not interview random woman that go solo. Why interview some addict runaway throwing the blame to their stupid life choices on everyone including society yet never bothered to look in the mirror and work for herself and do for herself besides lay on her back whenever she wants a bill payed or her weed.

6791153,5,B00P9Q1FJ0,"I've been studying the problem of human trafficking (labor and sex) in depth for over three years. I've seen many dozens of documentaries, short films and websites, consulted with front-line experts, read books and scoured more technical studies related to the subject than I can count. I can say with authority that this is one of the best produced films on the topic of sex trafficking in the United States.

As others have pointed out, it is incomplete: there is only so much that one can cover in 75 minutes. It does give a limited voice to those who claim that prostitution is a chosen ""profession"" for most. No doubt there are many women and girls who think they are getting a good bargain by engaging in prostitution. They believe that legitimizing, destigmatizing and regulating the ""world's oldest profession"" will provide the greatest reduction in sex trafficking. It is telling, however, that the expert opinion of a vice squad policeman in the film is that the violence cannot be contained.

There is no disputing that legally working in licensed brothels with dedicated security will provide a less dangerous environment for prostitutes. There have been some encouraging results with this in New Zealand although it is less clear how well the approach is working in the Netherlands and Germany. Anecdotally, we do see a remarkable correlation between increased social stigma and increased vulnerability to violence. For example, prostitution in Cambodia and India is normalized, but sex work remains a shameful label for women. Concurrently, attitudes towards women in these countries remain highly toxic. Thailand has a more openly accepted sex industry with less anecdotally reported violence against prostitutes and fewer cases of sex trafficking.

Ultimately, however, there will always be freelancers willing to provide exotic, underage or otherwise condom-free sex. A significant percentage of these freelancers will inevitably be controlled by pimps operating outside the bounds of the law. How do we help these victims?

The answer is not, I believe, to fully legalize what is really the world's oldest oppression. The best hope for them is to legalize the sale of sex to reduce the vulnerability of sex workers, but criminalize the buyers and then to vigorously pursue them. This is hardly a perfect solution, but then again, neither is full legitimization of prostitution, given its destructive effect on families. We see this in the disintegration of the Thai family unit where men regularly see prostitutes. In such cases, the emotional bonds between husband and wife are tenuous to the point that couples spend even their vacations apart.

One criticism about the movie: the cover is off-putting. There are more effective, less racy images to use to communicate the situation that these women are in.",1428192000,6,2826,5.202197802197802

6791155,5,B00P9Q1FJ0,"""Tricked"" is a new documentary film that examines the extent and growth of human sex trafficking in the United States, generally as it involves young women and girls. The producers of the film state that sex trafficking in America is a $3 billion per year industry. The film is a product of 3Generations, a non-profit organization ""dedicated to helping survivors of atrocities tell their stories to the world using film. We have recorded their voices as an act of healing and a call to action."" Jane Wells and John Keith-Wasson directed and wrote the film. Released to favorable reviews in 2013, the film has now been made available on DVD.  First Run Features, the distributor of the film, has kindly provided me with a review copy.

In the language of the trade, prostitutes turn ""tricks"" with their customers. As the title to the film and its promotional material point out, it is the women who are ""tricked"" and deeply abused in the sex trafficking industry.  The film includes extensive footage with young women in the life,with police and with prosecuting attorneys, with parents of girls ensnared in prostitution, with the johns, and with the pimps themselves. The movie shows sex trafficking in Boston and Lowell, Massachusetts, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Denver.

The movie paints a sordid picture. As a New York Times reporter says early in the film, sex trafficking tends to be regarded as a partnership between the pimps and the prostituties while in fact the relationship is more akin to slavery and exploitation. The film shows how vulnerable young girls are frequently unsuspectingly recruited into prostitution and then find it nearly impossible to escape. Pimping and trafficking cases are difficult and expensive to bring and to prove. The young prostitutes are often reluctant to testify against their pimps and are often considered suspect, uncredible witnesses when they do take the stand.

The movie includes gritty scenes of girls walking hard streets. In one scene, a young woman recounts how she and another girl were summoned to a warehouse for a Christmas eve party. The two women took positions on opposite sides of the warehouse with each performing sex acts for a long line of men. There are scenes with elaborately dressed and bejeweled pimps in expensive limosines boasting of their trade and of their wealth. The movie also includes many scenes of beatings. Several unapologetic johns also appear in the film discussing the appeal paid sex holds for them. Unlike some films with sex trafficking as a theme, ""Tricked"" offers a generally sympathetic portrayal of a number of dedicated law enforcement officers on vice squads, particularly in Las Vegas and Denver.  For example, the movie has extensive footage of Christopher Baughman, a young Las Vegas police officer who has earned recognition for his fights against vice, pimping, and pandering.  Baughman has written two books, ""Off the Street""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Off-the-Street/dp/1933016930/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Off the Street</a>&nbsp;and ""Off the Street: Redemption""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Off-the-Street-Redemption/dp/B00CGNQUSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Off the Street: Redemption</a>&nbsp;which describe the details of his activities against organized vice in Sin City.

The film argues that young women of virtually any background or education may be targeted by pimps. However, it doesn't show a great deal about the early lives of the victims that it portrays. The movie has the goal of increasing public awareness of and reducing tolerance for sex trafficking. The option of legalizing and regulating the sex trade is raised in the movie and rejected. The film advocates instead decriminalizing prostitution for the young women and moving agressively against the pimps and the customers.

The film moves dramatically and well.  It demystifies a sleazy business while still luring the viewer into an endlessly fascinating complex subject.
The short extras to the film include an interview with a professional dominatrix about the trafficking trade and scenes of past Super Bowls. Sports events, especially the Super Bowl, are magnets for sex trafficking.  This film will be of interest to anyone, including those who are skeptical of advocacy, wanting to know about sex trafficking and prostitution.

Total Time:  75 minutes

8687081,1,B00P9Q1FJ0,"This movie was so insulting I almost had a mind to write those responsible for it. It consistently portrays white women as victims, white men a cops and rescuers, black women as willing and cooperative hookers and black men as pimps. I haven't seen anything this bad since I watched the original ""Birth of a nation"".",1483488000,,316,4.660714285714286
8687082,3,B00P9Q1FJ0,"Having recently read and reviewed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brothel-Mustang-Ranch-and-Its-Women/dp/0449006581/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brothel: Mustang Ranch and Its Women</a>, this documentary seemed like an interesting follow-up.  One issue that BROTHEL brought up a few times was the distinction between prostituting in a brothel versus the more unpleasant alternative of street hooking.  TRICKED, although it does not touch upon brothel work, would seem to support that view.

The issue is simple: Many, if not most, of the girls working the streets are not there of their own volition.  If they started out that way, they change their minds quickly after coming under the employ of a pimp, who uses alternating reward and harsh punishment to keep girls emotionally abused and perpetually off balance.  Watching this documentary, the girls who actually did choose to work, but at brothels, became much more obvious.

We hear a lot from law enforcement about the difficulty of stopping the trade.  One simple reason, yet difficult to control for, is that the victims are themselves prosecuted for a crime.  As one cop said, in this instance, the pimp is telling the prostitutes the truth in that law enforcement in not their friend, and the girls cannot turn to cops for help.

One issue that is essentially in your face but which is never brought up is the race of the pimps.  All black.  It would be easy to say that there are white pimps, but they were not featured.  But this does not fly.  Really?  The film makers themselves did not think to include white pimps, given how ""racist"" it allegedly is to portray blacks poorly?  Jeez, we live in a society in which, if one white is seen rioting amongst a sea of blacks, the media bends itself into contortions to portray the riot as multi-racial.  It is not credible.  No wonder the film makers did not focus on it.  They likely did not have enough to include a significant number of white pimps to balance the scale, and so kept quiet about this obvious fact in order not to draw attention to it.",1464566400,,2103,5.099415204678363
8687083,4,B00P9Q1FJ0,"If you're new to the topic this is a good introduction with good definitions and a look into the systems at play. I thought it was great that Nicholas Kristof was included as he frequently writes about the topic and his column focuses on matters of justice and oppression.

However, I'm frustrated by the lack of diversity in the film. The survivors appear to be white and latina. I work with survivors in one of the whitest areas of the country and most of my clients are of minority ethnic backgrounds. Yes it happens to white girls, but also black girls and Asian girls and native girls and latina girls and older women, and men and boys. Pimps aren't just black men. In fact some data I've seen suggests that pimps tend to use victims in the same race. Don't rely on this film to be your only source of information.",1461369600,3,819,4.423841059602649

8687086,2,B00P9Q1FJ0,"I would have given this movie a higher rating save for two reasons:

1. the vast majority of victims were white females and all the pimps were black males. There are thousands of black female victims but they were made to look like they were enjoying their exploitation. There are hundreds of white pimps in the U.S. but not a one was seen in this film. That is why I cannot recommend this film because it panders to the stereotypes of the happy black whore and the morally corrupting black pimp. Yes, those pimps need to be prosecuted and locked up. Yes, those girls and women are victims of both the pimps, law enforcement and the johns. But the exclusion of white pimps and black females as victims is as much an injustice as the nature of prostitution itself. I will not recommend this film.",1443657600,20,795,4.482758620689655

8687090,5,B00P9Q1FJ0,"Tricked; A Shocking Look Inside Americas Sex Trade caught my interest due to me just wanting to be curious on why my late biological mother got caught up and seemingly stuck in what appears to be a dangerous profession. I must preface by making it clear that I do not have an interest in ever working in this field regardless of whether the prostitution trade was made legal or stayed illegal(attributed in part to how my adoptive parents raised me). The informative parts of this documentary; Law enforcement officials were interviewed in this documentary, a caseworker, various former prostitutes that are super young that seemingly escaped from the field, and some pimps themselves were interviewed.  Some of the following facts of this documentary; Many girls are forced into prostitution around age 12, one featured in the documentary was as young as 11 years old. A caseworker was featured who was trying to help a 14 year old and her baby, but he was told that he and his wife were technically not allowed to help her out. At the end of the documentary, it is listed that she actually lost custody of her baby and was missing. Some other people featured; Dr. Shera Bradley a psychologist, Cindy a former Las Vegas escort,  Mitch Morissey a Denver District Attorney, Hugh- a john, and Nikolas Kristoff a journalist. Then there is the discussion of what is called A Players Ball that is held in Chicago where supposedly pimps and their girls get dressed in scantily clad clothing. There is also a scene of footage in Las Vegas Nevada and some Las vegas bar named the Chandelier. As per Karen Hughes of the Las Vegas Police-Las Vegas Nevada is a top destination for prostitution because of the glamour scene of Las Vegas and the amount of financial wealth that flows around. The other informative angle was that many of the young prostitutes featured bravely recounted what they endured and what happened along the way before they escaped. However, my caveat with this film, there were not much prostitutes featured who have kids (when it is common knowledge that many prostitutes are mothers whose young children are at risk of being the sexual targets of their mothers clients and/or lovers). Additionally, the documentary could have been made stronger by also featuring women who were in their 30s,40s,50s and maybe beyond. Last, but not least, there were not men or transgendered people featured in this documentary and it is also common knowledge that both male prostitutes and transgendered prostitutes are also at risk of suffering greatly in what is currently a dangerous profession across the United States (due to the common knowledge that prostitution is illegal in most parts of the United States). Im  reluctant to share my viewpoint because I already know that it most likely may not happen during my lifetime if ever, but after watching this documentary I do feel that the crimes involved with prostitution may decrease if prostitution is made legal across the United States (with the stipulations that the prostitutes are at least 17 or 18 years of age, the prostitutes are paid a minimum wage with taxes based on income and other rules necessary to make the profession safer). The reason for my viewpoint-more prostitutes would feel safe coming forward to law officials to report if they are being harmed by either their johns and/or pimps and the money that is taxed from prostitution can be used for greater good such as job retraining programs for prostitutes who are truly ready to leave the field and want to get into a more legitimate career and/or job that is  a guaranteed employment vehicle to where they do not have to sell their body, safe childcare for children of prostitutes etc. I must avoid explaining more because this is not the forum for me to do so (anyone with further questions as to what I wrote can always send me a personal facebook message).",1438732800,,3888,4.850903614457831
