8751502,5,B00YQFYUGA,"This 2 disc set produced by Grapevine Video contains for me a very nice silent serial, formed of twelve independent stories episodes.
Fearless, the Famous Police Dog, the star, show a wide range of tricks and screen charm. The episodes came from the most excellent prints surviving of the silent era, so we can wacth all twelve episodes in the same very high quality. There are six episodes in each disc, each one is a two-reeler, about from 19 to 26 minutes.
Each story is filled with intense action, from drama to comedy, competent cast and crew, from Joe Rock Productions. Not so big movie company of these days, but doing very good jobs, also I can remember now they produced some great Stan Laurel shorts. Highlly recommended for silent movie fans and canine stars fans also !!!",1437868800,,783,4.681159420289855
