5819422,5,B00DJSUOTM,This is truly one crazy but after another I love love loved it and you will too.  This film is so crazy funny you'll have to switch it over and over again to catch the little amazing things:-),1390435200,4,192,4.052631578947368
5819423,5,B00DJSUOTM,"I have to say that I got this movie for Christine Lahti, she is always great. As it turns out, the entire cast is superb and the story is amazing on a lot of levels. I give high marks to all the actors. Kudos to the actors who play both her sons. Spectacular.",1387843200,4,259,3.9056603773584904
5819424,4,B00DJSUOTM,"The television (PBS) psychologist John Bradshaw, PhD, once quipped, 98% of American families are dysfunctional--and the other 2% is in denial. From what I have observed of my own 'family' and others, that seems about right. The family Petunia seems downright well-adjusted compared to my family (e.g., after decades of deceit, I just learned the man who 'raised' me--and abused me emotionally and physically--is/was NOT my biological father, that explains the abuse). The Petunia family seems to face their crises head-on, without flinching and then set about to try and bring some comfort and solace through honest communication, intervention and effort. While uplifting, that may be a bit Pollyanna in reality. However, in the film's defense of taking this approach, the mother in the film is, after all, a psychologist--so that does have a certain ring of truth and one can fully understand how this approach might happen. I thought Eric Urie was absolutely delightful. That kind of ambiguous, unsure sexuality is so appealing--on screen! In real life, I would hate to be the person(s), involved with someone who moves on the sexual continuum without a real sense of the impact of their ambiguity on others. This character via Urie's performance, doesn't knowingly or willingly inflict pain--it is just the collateral damage of being what and who he is at a particular point in time. In the case of Urie's character, he does find resolution, but who really knows. Lahti, Rasche and the others all deliver fine performances. Dysfunction handled in this dark comedy manner really succeeds without bringing us so down, we can't look-up. However, there are films that tackle dysfunction on a downward trajectory without any humor and don't look back--think American Beauty, Ordinary People, Imaginary Heroes or the Ice Storm.",1387065600,5,1824,5.228668941979522
5819425,2,B00DJSUOTM,The characters are not believable and the story is not compelling. Watching this mindless drivel was not worth my time. Don't waste your money!,1381017600,,143,5.0
5819426,4,B00DJSUOTM,Quirky fun.  Could be a screen adaption of Broadway. Resolves issues of sexual identities despite confused desires and best intentions.,1380412800,3,135,5.75
5819427,1,B00DJSUOTM,"This movie had promise by looking at the trailer. But it didn't live up to it in any way. Thora Birch's character was rotten to the core, hard to watch, hard to believe, and the acting was awful. The actor who played the son Charlie was good. The mom was awesome. But they had no support from either storyline or other actors. Skip this movie, you'll never get those two hours back.

Plus, it streamed VERY slowly from Amazon. Every time I needed to stop or rewind, I waited for several minutes (like 5 to 10).",1379548800,2,510,4.3125
5819428,5,B00DJSUOTM,"A great indie that follows a modern family and their attempts to navigate the trials and tribulations associated with living within the modern condition. Even though this movie kept my attention throughout, I thought that there were some scenes in particular that absolutely blew my mind. You won't regret sitting down to watch this under-appreciated film.",1376956800,7,356,5.375
5819429,5,B00DJSUOTM,"Surprising that I'd never heard of this film before. Knockout acting, by the whole cast! And an uncommonly intelligent script.",1425427200,,126,5.35
5819430,5,B00DJSUOTM,Item received.,1424131200,,14,6.5
5819431,3,B00DJSUOTM,Watched for Brittany Snow. LOVE HER...wish the story and script were stronger.,1423353600,,78,5.583333333333333

5819433,4,B00DJSUOTM,"The best word to describe this movie is ""quirky"" and whilst it was referred to me as a gay romance film, that is only one part of this. Slight spoilers ahead, but Petunia is the surname of a family where this film revolves around. It is unusual at parts, however, the witty humor overshadows those parts.",1404345600,,304,4.446428571428571
5819434,5,B00DJSUOTM,"Highly recommend this movie.  Great cast.  Crazy, sweet, silly, emotional.  LOVED IT!

Michael Urie (Ugly Betty) surprised me about half way through it as I finally realized it was indeed him.  Funny what a pair of glasses and different mannerisms can do for a character.

As for the folks complaining about ""what a bunch of cry babies"" and ""worst movie ever"" and this and that... well I grew up in a very similar house hold in FLORIDA, my adopted mom was a psychologist working at the University of South Florida and single.  We had allot of interesting people in and out of the house all the time so that made things even more interesting, all walks of life I might add.  Helped me understand my trying to figure out my own sexual identity which turned out my being a young gay person.

I thought all the conversations were realistic from MY point of view. I understood when the characters were frustrated and going through the roof needing to be loved and paid attention to.  My mom was an alcoholic and type A personality so you can only imagine what it was like needing and missing the guidance, love and attention that any young person really needs to flourish.  And it's left me some pretty obvious deep seated scars.  But, in a way, this movie was like therapy for me because only a child raised in a weird upbringing like that could actually understand, relate and even enjoy what was being shown on the screen.

KUDOS to the entire cast, director, screen writer, camera man for some very interesting angles and everyone else involved.  Deserved the 5 stars!",1398988800,,1567,4.610108303249097
5819435,4,B00DJSUOTM,I have been wanting to see this movie for awhile and I am glad I finally did.  I laughed from beginning to end.  It is dark and funny and silly...that is entertainment.  That is it's job...to entertain.  The production quality and sound were superb.  The acting was great.  What more do you want from a silly comedy?,1395532800,2,316,4.456140350877193
5819436,1,B00DJSUOTM,"This is a terrible, terrible, TERRIBLE movie! I didn't believe it could be as bad as other reviewers said it was, but I was wrong. They were right!

I admire those who held out for 40 minutes and more. They deserve a medal! I hit eject at 9:32, after Christine Lahti (didn't she use to be good?) said, at her son's wedding, ""Tell him his ear wax is making me nauseous."" I mean, I'm from a dysfunctional family, but even we weren't ALL obnoxious morons like every single person in this horrible movie; and we weren't even rich!

Has there ever been a stupider screenplay than this? A more clumsily wasted group of actors? More incompetent direction?

This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen Plan 9 from Outer Space.",1393286400,,737,4.404411764705882
5819437,1,B00DJSUOTM,Terrible movie!!! Complaining bunch of family members who are cry babies! Can't believe they actually released this crappy movie. Don't even waste your time,1391817600,,156,5.541666666666667
5819438,4,B00DJSUOTM,"As we watched this movie, I was concerned that this was going to be one of those films where everyone is odd to an unrealistic degree and there's really no story.  But my attitude towards it softened in that there was at least resolution of the plotlines (there are a few) in the end and parts of it are rather thought-provoking.  It's a family drama that won't convert you if you don't like family dramas (or stories about dysfunctional families), but if you can see the entertainment value in dysfunction, there is something to like here.  It's worth a viewing if you feel open to watching a film that is low on action and high on internal conflict.",1390953600,2,651,4.5
8593830,5,B00DJSUOTM,This movie is quirky and weird. It's just so out of this world you can't stop laughing.,1514246400,,87,4.176470588235294
8593831,5,B00DJSUOTM,"Not since the since 'Soap' on TV has their been such a riotous, campy satire of the 'Big Apple!' The shear momentum of this film will keep you on your toes!!  Whhat is so great is the way both Gay and Straight events are so intertwined.  NJMJr!!",1511395200,,245,4.191489361702128

8593833,5,B00DJSUOTM,"The outstanding performance in this film is Brittany Snow.  She was an unexpected measure of comedy and tragic, fractured generation-X spouse. Highly enjoyable quiet movie.",1499385600,,172,5.88
8593834,5,B00DJSUOTM,"I just love quirky, independent and weird movies and the fact that two psychotherapists are clueless as to what even constitutes happiness was a question often brought up in my own graduate psyche classes.  Charlie was simply adorable and he was actually the ""sane"" one in the family.  What's the purpose of being gay when you don't want to engage in gay sex?  Why did Micheal get married to a girl who obviously didn't love him to begin with and why the never ending list of ""if I did this, would you still love me?""  This family is sort of Addams family and weird and the ending is cool.  I wonder how long it will take before George gets tired and wants to move on.  Come on, a mother psychologist who suggests that a guy sexually assault her son is pretty whacked.  I loved the craziness of this family and those they come into contact with.",1496016000,,845,4.378205128205129
8593835,5,B00DJSUOTM,Very enjoyable story line!,1481241600,,26,5.75
8593836,4,B00DJSUOTM,It's quirky and funny. Definitely not your mainstream plot but that's what I liked about it. It's the kind of movie that you will love or hate.,1479081600,,143,4.333333333333333

8593838,2,B00DJSUOTM,"What a disappointment and waste of talent. CanNOT believe Michael Urie signed on to this role. TOTAL waste of his talent. Tobias Segal is very talented and as cute as they come, BUT...terribly written story. Christine Lahti--canNOT believe that she has been relegated to roles like hers in this film. Really canNOT recommend as much as I hoped I could.",1433808000,,352,4.883333333333334
8593839,3,B00DJSUOTM,"It's a hard film to watch because of the character's pain, but cathartic. It reveals what goes on behind the scenes, I suppose. I watched this to gain insight into our own family dynamics.  Tobias Segal as Charlie was my favorite character.",1431993600,,240,4.714285714285714
