3525942,5,B001D5F38K,A great surfing movie with outstanding photography at some of the best surfing spots in California with some of the best longboarders.  The clip of Dale Velzy's funeral is worth the price of the movie.  All the legend's are there.  Pretty moving.  A+,1232323200,3,250,4.744186046511628
3525943,5,B001D5F38K,"I bought this video for my husband, a California surfer. When he asked me to sit down and watch it with him; I thought...oh gosh, another surf video. I was thinking I will just sit down and watch it for a couple of minutes...but ended up falling in love with the scenery, the stories about the coastal areas of California, and the waves California surfers are able to catch. The story starts in San Diego and ends up in Santa Cruz, visiting several other beaches along the coast. I ended up watching the entire video and could watch it again!",1231200000,2,542,4.43
3525944,5,B001D5F38K,"This has quickly become one of my favorite surf videos - along with Searching for Tom Curren and Surfing for Life, it's inspiring, without just showing a bunch of pros on perfect waves in exotic locations. It shows the California I love and the surfing spirit I love.",1228003200,3,267,4.583333333333333
3525945,5,B001D5F38K,"I grew up surfing California and there are a number of things about the state that I miss.  This movie captures the key elements of why I love the CA coastal lifestyle.  Nostalgic without being sappy, looking back at the past while at the same time embracing the challenges beach-goers face today.  Awesome.  The movie is broken up by region (which fits with how I think of the state anyway,) with personality segments from each region. Skip Frye, Joel Tudor, Curren(Tom, Joe) the Ubiquitous Malloy brothers segment etc...

Although I surf and love the film, it seems like the movie was put together for surfers & non-surfers alike.  If you liked Single Fin Yellow, Siestas & Olas or even Endless Summer, you'll love this flick.

Good job guys...",1199232000,12,746,4.78125
3525946,4,B001D5F38K,"Not the normal surf video.
A great add to any surf library.
There's a bit more Joel Tudor and long boarding than I needed but the film is about California history and what is California history without longboarding, so it works.
I'm also not a huge Tom Curren fan BUT this is the best Tom Curren footage I've ever seen!!! Truly amazing! I suppose performances like this are why people rave about the former world champion - DVD is worth getting for this alone!
Bottom line, the video just has a great relaxing feeling, punctuated with moments of on the edge of your chair footage that make me want to watch it again and again.
Worth having for sure.",1350864000,2,649,4.46218487394958
3525947,5,B001D5F38K,"Nowadays it seems like a new surf movie is put out every week. Unlike some flicks that are hastily put together and edited with random punk rock songs and 5 second clips of some shortboarder pulling off a 360 air (nothing wrong with that, but it gets old), One California Day is a montage of some of California's influential surfers and shapers, both past and present, as well as a journey through some amazing surf breaks. This movie could more accurately be described as a ""film"", since the makers shot in 16mm rather than in digital, giving it a unique feel. The film is well-paced and never feels rushed. As it goes through different areas of California - San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, etc., you feel as though the filmmakers are your tour guides and like you are right there with them. I saw one reviewer complain that they didn't cover enough of Northern California; however, in the film's commentary, the filmmakers admit that trying to cover the entire coast of California was a daunting task, and that they only covered a portion of it. Supposedly they spent years shooting and collecting all the footage for the film. Along with great surfing shots, there are little side stories that let you peak into some of the surfer's lives. To top it off, the film had a great original soundtrack with many of the songs by the ""One California Day House Band"". The filmmakers stated that they hoped this film would appeal to surfers as well as non-surfers, and I believe it does. If you haven't yet seen this film, do yourself a favor and check it out.",1348272000,2,1575,4.628571428571429
3525948,2,B001D5F38K,"As a NorCal surfer, I was disappointed. The vast majority of the movie is focused on southern California, with only about five minutes in the vicinity of Santa Cruz. Female surfers are largely ignored as well.

This should have been called ""One SOUTHERN California Day with No Women in Sight"".",1344988800,,293,4.86
3525949,2,B001D5F38K,"Typical guy-centric surf film.  It's a tough world to enter if you happen to be female, however, it was nice to see Tom Curren's little brother (and wife, albeit briefly) as a focal point during the film.
Hey guys, it's okay to put a few female surfers in your films once in a while.  Geez...",1340496000,2,292,4.290909090909091
3525950,5,B001D5F38K,A must have for any surfer in California.  I have watched it 3 times in the first month I have had it.,1334707200,,102,3.6363636363636362
3525951,5,B001D5F38K,"One California Day is the first surf film i've ever watched and by far the best i've ever watched..and i've watched many; from old to modern, longboard to performance shortboarding. Not only is surfing itself fun to watch, but also the culture and lifestyle these surfers live by. I feel this is glanced over in a lot of surf films. I think it is important to go into surf culture and lifestyles so non surfers can enjoy it too, and sometimes be inspired to pursue this beautiful lifestyle.  This film outlines it perfectly and there is just so much rich tradition and style in California that has never really been detailed as much. The soundtrack is also my favorite surf soundtrack too! Blends well and enhances the laid-backness of the film. This truly is a great film for surfers and non surfers to enjoy. Highly recommended!",1326672000,,830,4.684931506849315
3525952,5,B001D5F38K,"Amazing Video, California is a very young state compared to the rest of the american states, not many californian natives can trace there line back more than a few generations.  With Millions of transplants and immigrants coming into the state, not many feel a deep rooted connection to the land and people. This movie really give us a sense of pride and culture derived from the roots of californian surf culture.",1311379200,,414,4.830985915492958
3525953,5,B001D5F38K,"This may be my favorite surf movie of all time. It definitely has the most replay value, to the point where when I lost my first copy I got another.
From a film perspective it is top notch with gorgeous visuals and editing, sure to please anyone no matter how high their standards. The stories are interesting to the point that this is one of the few surf flicks that I don't hesitate to watch with non-surfers in the room; most find it tolerable, if not very interesting. The surf itself is killer; Knost's longboard antics, Tom Curren at crazed Sandspit, amazing swell at Rincon, etc. There is higher-level surfing in other videos, but few if any can match this for overall feel. This video just makes me want to go get out there, surfing or otherwise, more than any other. It's not a really quantifiable thing, you've really just got to see it.",1263168000,,847,4.5064935064935066
3525954,5,B001D5F38K,One California Day masterfully captures a moment in the evolution of surfing culture through the lens of those who have a deep appreciation for the original spirit of surfing.  It is shot entirely along the coast of California with local pros giving unique descriptions of their home breaks and the communities that define them.  A truly great film that will inspire you to take something greater from the surfing experience and give something more to your local community.,1259539200,3,473,5.051282051282051
3525955,5,B001D5F38K,"As a west coast surfer soul surfer who loves baja as well as the Pacific Northwest, this film was a wonderful expression of the joy of being in the water and the spirit of surfing the different regions of the coast. An inspiring reminder of surfing as a way of life. Even though I could do without the attitudes at Malibu and OC, the other stories were well worth it.",1233273600,,367,4.257142857142857

8291747,5,B001D5F38K,I can watch this one over and over. It reminds me of why I stayed in California when my brothers and sister left. The chilliness of the northern waters through the crowds of the LA/Malibu scene and down to Baja where waves of all sorts offer daily surprises to anyone with a desire to surf. A keeper.,1363737600,,300,4.280701754385965
8291748,5,B001D5F38K,"Vid has a great feel.  Super good music.  Good variety of surfers, old, young, longboard, short, performance.  Quirky dudes and quiet stoic ones.  Cali may only be epic on certain days out of the year but it's ours and I love it.  Shows surfers non-surfing sides and lifestyles, which was cool.  Can really connect to some of these guys off the water endeavors.  Really good.",1361232000,,375,4.676923076923077
