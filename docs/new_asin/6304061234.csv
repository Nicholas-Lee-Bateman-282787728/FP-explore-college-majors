775832,3,6304061234,"My son loves this video, he is almost two years old and has requested it frequently for months.  I think it taught him to dance.

THAT BEING SAID, it troubles me deeply that they spell ""Elmocize"" with a ""z.""  ""Exercise"" is spelled with an ""s.""  Generation after generation will continue to struggle with spelling the word ""exercise."" Just look at some of the other reviews and the problem is clear.  Elmo needs one more spelling video.

I love the singing caterpillar lady.  Is that in this one? Or am I thinking of Happy Healthy Monsters?  That video is not much better, but it does have Cookie Monster and that always helps.",1473379200,,626,4.576576576576577

775915,5,6304061234,"I bought this for my 2 year old grandson who loves Elmo and he LOVES to dance. This lively fun DVD teaches how to move your arms, legs, your whole body. We do the routines, sing the songs, and giggle, giggle, giggle, together.
The kids in the video are familiar faces from other Sesame Street videos we have such as ""Let's Do The Alphabet.""  A strong aid in teaching our 2 year old his ABC's which he has mastered siting as well as identifying his letters. This is why even though we've only had Elmocize a week, I am very confidant our grandson is learning a life time of healthy exercise activities from it. I highly recommend this DVD",1404345600,2,637,4.352941176470588
775916,2,6304061234,"If you're buying this purely as an entertainment dvd, I suppose it could be a three or four star DVD.  If you're buying it to encourage your child to exercise while inside,  It's pretty much useless.

I didn't think about it before we bought it,  but it makes sense that it would be bad for that purpose. Elmo is a puppet. It's not like he can teach your kids to do a jumping Jack.

Anyway,  I'd hoped to find something to keep my very sedentary toddler active throughout our long winters inside,  but no dice on this one.  We found the Giam Yoga kids combo pack did really well for us for that purpose.

My son absolutely loves Elmo, so I purchased this to add to his vast Elmo DVD collection and get him to have fun while learning to exercise.  This is the absolutely WORST Elmo DVD!  It does nothing to get kids moving, it is only 30 min and, while I am a fan of Cyndi Lauper (her 80s music), she was terrible.  Do not waste your money on this one.  I only have it one star because I don't think there's an option for ""no stars.""

776097,1,6304061234,"What a horrible, horrible video!!  There is hardly any actual exercising at all.  I bought this so my kids could burn some energy in the winter months indoors, but they ended up sitting on the floor for most of this, waiting for the ""moving"" part.  The singers in this video are NOT GOOD, making the video even more unbearable.  ""Workout in a Chair"" may be the worst song I've ever heard in my life.  It is so terrible, and it gets stuck in my head every time I hear it and gives me nightmares.  I'm selling this video for $1 just to get it out of my house!!",1266969600,,558,4.12037037037037

776101,5,6304061234,"This DVD was given to us as a hand me down and my daughter loves it! We watch it at least once a day and she would watch it more if I would let her. The acting isn't the best, but my daughter doesn't seem to be a film critic. She enjoys the music and is learning to hop, jump, about elbows and knees. It is great to get her up and moving and also has helped to boost her vocabulary.",1233705600,,382,3.728395061728395
776102,5,6304061234,"When my children were little we did Elmocize. Now I will be watching other peoples small children in my home, so I ordered the video on DVD. I'm glad I could still get it!!!",1233273600,,173,4.117647058823529
776103,4,6304061234,"I think part of the point of this was that exercise can be fun and doesn't have to be done exactly ""right""--just get up and move!  And in that sense, it works beautifully; my 2 1/2 year old is up and singing and dancing for the whole 30 minutes.

It's true that the moves are a little free form, but what do I expect for a toddler? (I don't WANT her to think that if she's not ""perfect"" it doesn't count! I want her to be happy to move her body to the music.) It's true that the workout in a chair woman probably doesn't make the bulk of her living singing. But she obviously loves to dance, loves kids, and inspires them to move with her so this video does exactly what it should do.

So why did I deduct one star?  I, personally, don't enjoy those songs very much and since my daughter does I hear them a lot anyway. I will be recommending this product to parents looking for an excercise video for little ones, and I'll also give them fair warning that this isn't the one the whole family is likely to enjoy.",1193616000,,1011,4.116751269035533
776104,3,6304061234,"I purchased this DVD for my three year old who is in love with Elmo. I thought that it would be a sort of excercise video that would have the kids dancing around and moving instead of just watching another Elmo video, that way she gets to see Elmo but she is not just sitting in front of the TV. However, while the characters do dance sometimes, they stand around and talk about excercising more than actually doing anything. Essentially, the kids are just sitting watching another video.",1189296000,,488,4.556818181818182
776163,3,6304061234,"I bought this at a local thrift store which was great because it was cheap! From the moment I played it I wasn't keen on it, but unfortunately my little one liked it. However, he does request it as much as he use to. After 4 or 5 months of it, he's done. Thank God! I think he was just happy to see Elmo more than anything. He really DIDN'T LIKE the segment with the carton catapillar (with German accent) singing to get kids to stretch. He would shout ""NO! NO! NO!) and make me fast forward it. It was great seeing Cyndi Lauper twisting and trying to do a cabana routine. Pure silliness! My advice, avoid it, but good overall message about exercising.",1184198400,,652,4.266129032258065
776164,1,6304061234,"Eventhough my 21 month old daughter loves this video, I cannot stand it.  Not only are some of the tunes incredibly REPETITIVE, but the song with Cyndi Lauper is dreadful. I am not impressed with this video at all, and I hope my daughter grows out of it pretty quick!",1157155200,2,267,4.34
776165,5,6304061234,"I bought this at a yard sale for my 8 month old daughter and she will sit and watch this video, bouncing along to the music and throwing her hands around, with a huge smile on her face.  This allows me to get some housework done!  Otherwise, my daughter will not sit still or pay any attention to any other video or movie that we have.  Since she started watching this, she is fascinated with Elmo and her face just lights up if she sees Elmo on tv or an Elmo doll at a store.  The songs on this video, to adults, probably seem pretty bad, but if she gets fussy in the car, I can get her bouncing around and smiling again just by singing some of the songs.  I give it 2 thumbs up!",1151625600,,680,3.9705882352941178
776166,3,6304061234,"My son just adores Elmo, so I got this video because it would have lots of Elmo in it.  But, it doesn't grab his attention that much.

776167,4,6304061234,"This is a good video to get you up and moving.  It even has a chair exercise for those who aren't able to get up and move.  After each segment there is a rest time with dialogue between Elmo and a Muppet news announcer.  It encourages children to move and use their imagination to move.  If you were looking for particular exercise moves that really is only in the chair exercise segment.  The children I purchased it for enjoyed the airplane segment, however, the first time we watched it they just wanted to see what it was about.  Second viewing they got up and moved",1141689600,,570,4.380952380952381
776168,1,6304061234,"I was not at all impressed with Elmocize.  My girls love Elmo, but were not in the least bit interested in this DVD.  It does not get them to move around at all.  I did, though, find a children's DVD that does get my girls to move- Tots Rock by joue joue.  We watch it all the time",1141344000,,281,3.793103448275862

776170,3,6304061234,"Not the greatest video or even an exersize tape for that matter, it was cute and all, but it is in no way, shape or form a means of getting your kids to exersize more-they do have a few get up and move stits-but other than that it is not what the heading claims.

The 3 best Sesame Street videos I have are: ""1,2,3 Count With Me""-with Ernie as the host of the video, ""The Great Numbers Game""-with Telly and Elmo as the hosts and ""Lets Do the Alphabet"" with Big Bird and Baby Bear as the hosts. I have over 18 S.S. videos/dvd's and only the 3 mentioned are worth watching and the money I paid for them.

The short scenes of ""activities"", such as bending, jumping, and twisting, are appropriate for young toddlers that are not ready for choreographed workouts.  The length of the scenes are appropriate for this age group as their attention spans are not very long.

776228,4,6304061234,This was by far my daughter's favorite video when she was two. She would literally watch it over and over until we hid it. She would stand up and do the exercises with the kids and sing the songs everywhere. For that I would definitely give it 5 stars. It is great entertainment and has a great message--everyone can exercise. The bad thing (for which I would give it 3 stars with an average of 4 stars) is that the songs are SOOOOO annoying!! If I hear the Workout in a Chair song again I will explode. That woman is so annoying it's ridiculous. But I suppose it's worth it for the kids!,1031443200,,588,4.212389380530974
776229,1,6304061234,"If Elmo were interviewed, and they asked him about ""Elmocize,"" he'd have to make excuses.  He was young... he didn't know what he was doing.
We own this tape as part of our VAST Sesame Street and Elmo collection, since our daughter loves the furry red monster with every ounce of her being.  But I have to say that ""Elmocize"" is the absolute worst Elmo video out there (well, that we've found, anyway).  The concept, getting kids to move to the beat, have fun, and exercise with Elmo, is a good one.  However, this unfortunate tape was made at one of the low points (in my opinion) in Sesame Street history.  The cast at the time was, er, less than talented.  So, I have to agree with a previous reviewer--the poor girl who runs the dance studio couldn't sing her way out of a wet paper bag (I guess that's why she's a dancer!).  It's not ALL her fault, though--the songs are really weak here!  It starts with the insipid ""Elmocize!  Elmocize!  Everybody . . . Elmocize!""  Repeat, repeat, repeat.  You'll be thinking ""Elmocide!  Elmocide!  Somebody . . . commit Elmocide!""  And we LOVE Elmo!  Even the Sesame Street kids on the tape seem really, really bored--like they'd rather be studying multiplication.  Put it this way--when and if our daughter ever gets to that ""rip the tape out of the cassette for fun"" stage, I hope this one's the first to go.",981417600,62,1352,4.520661157024794
776230,1,6304061234,"My daughter resents the time I spend on my exercise tapes.  I was hoping to include her, by doing this Elmo tape together.  Unfortunately this is a terrible tape if that is what you want.  She was bored, the few exercises on the tape were sandwiched between vignettes that distracted you.  My daughter doesn't mind sitting and watching, but there is nothing on this tape to get her up and moving.  As for me, I can't even bear to sit through it.

I'm pretty disappointed with it, though. I wanted something we could do together, but the little workouts don't do much for me. Also, the music is awful. Even though she's a peppy critter, the ""Workout in a Chair"" lady couldn't find the key to her tune for love or money. Cyndi Lauper also belts out more than her share of clinkers, and seems somehow remote from the proceedings. The tunes themselves are nowhere near the usual Sesame Street standard.",978307200,,636,4.6371681415929205

I also have some preschool children come over once in awhile and I thought I would try it on them.  I kept them entertained by doing the tape with them but about half way through I had lost the interest of 6 of them and then the last girl stopped me and told me she didn't want to watch that tape any more.

It's not my favorite, but, of course, I bought it for my daughter, now 17 months.  She enjoys it simply because Elmo is in it, and she loves his voice.  However, in the segments when Elmo isn't involved, she does tend to lose interest.  As a teacher who is married to a former special ed. bus driver, I agree it's important to include children with a wide range of abilities; unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, Workout in a Chair is pretty bad in a ""grate on your nerves"" sort of way.  We don't watch this one often, but it makes a good filler when we've seen our other videos too much in the last week.
Not the best Elmo video, but if you're like me, and need to rotate your videos for your own sanity, go ahead and add it to your collection.",973209600,11,852,4.196319018404908

7860905,2,6304061234,"This isn't really a workout video for kids. It follows the typical Sesame Street format of short skits, so there a lots of pauses where the kids aren't really directed to move around. My kid would just sit down and start watching during these and it would take a lot of effort to get him up and moving for the dancing/exercising parts",1481500800,,334,4.403225806451613
