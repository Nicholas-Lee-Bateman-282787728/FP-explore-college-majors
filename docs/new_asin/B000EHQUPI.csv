8110106,3,B000EHQUPI,"I bought this DVD just for the Madrid episode. If I was only rating that episode, it would be a 4. I actually preferred Rudy's Madrid episode over Rick Steves' Madrid episode. The rest of this DVD, however, was just filler crap.

Madrid is a beautiful, sprawling city. It is the most underrated city in Europe. There are a lot of attractive mujeres in Madrid. Rudy visited the Puerta del Sol, Royal Palace of Madrid, the Faunia Zoo, the Prado Museum, and Retiro Park, which is across the street from the Prado. He also enjoyed a performance by Flamenco dancers. He took a side trip to Toledo, which is famous for sword making. The only mistake Rudy made is that he didn't mention how to get around (Madrid has a Metro system).

The rest of the DVD was lame. In the portion titled ""Four Great Cities"", Rudy went on a bunch of one day trips to several European cities. Seriously, who goes all the way across the Atlantic Ocean to London and then spends only one day there?  In his one day excursion to London, Rudy passed by Big Ben, the House of Parliament, Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, and the London Eye. He didn't have time to actually visit those places. He briefly visited the Tate Modern and Leicester (lester) Square.

In Amsterdam, he passed by its beautiful canals and at lunch at an Indonesian restaurant known as Puri Mas. He stopped by the Rikjsmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum, but there was no mention of the red light district or Anne Frank.

I find Brussels to be boring. Rudy ate Belgian chocolate and stopped by the Grand Palace Square and comic museum.

In Paris, there was a spectacular view from the Notre Dame. Rudy also visited the Orsay Museum and Rodin (Rodan) Museum, which has a nice sculpture garden. Nevertheless, this was way too little time in the City of Lights.

In ""Four Great Cities II"", Rudy went on the Nyvhavn Boat Tour in Copenhagen. He also stopped by Tivoli Gardens, an amusement park for both kids and adults. Since Copenhagen is a smaller city, it is possible to cover it in a day.

In Berlin, Rudy stopped by Potzdamer Platz, an enclosed shopping and entertainment complex. He also visited the Jewish Museum and the Pergamon Museum which features Babylonian antiquities. He made a poignant visit to Checkpoint Charlie.

I really didn't care much about Munich. It didn't feature much besides beer gardens.

In Rome, Rudy visited a Colosseum and some fountains. He also stopped by the Vatican, which is a distinct country. He concluded by enjoying a pizza and gelato.

Rudy already sells a separate DVD featuring London, Paris, and Amsterdam. I would've preferred that he discuss the smaller cities more in depth than to include vignettes of the larger cities.",1394582400,,2706,4.687763713080169
8110107,2,B000EHQUPI,"Rudy Maxa has a vast array of travelogue dvds, but this not one of his better ones. Although art is an integral part of European history and culture, it's a mistake to delve into a full tour of each museum when each city synopsis on this dvd is so short. Instead of showing the remarkable scenery/streets of each city, Rudy's museum obsession overshadowed other city sites available and I feel as though i saw little else. I also agree with another reviewer that Rudy stays at more opulent hotels that most of us could never afford. It is fine to dream of traveling the high-life, but a more practical approach would be appealing, to real travelers. This dvd leaves me no desire to see any one of the countries he has improperly featured.",1365120000,,738,4.556390977443609
