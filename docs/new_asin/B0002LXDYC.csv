Ive noticed some matches have back stories, which is cool if you forgot why they are fighting. The extras on a couple dvds are the same. I mean how many moments can you have on DVD every year? This is not bloated like Wrestlemaina 20's 3 disc set, but Wrestlemaina 20 was a pretty crappy, over produced event. Anther cool extra feature that Im surprised no one has meteioned on this dvd is the complete Warrior-Hogan title match at Wrestlemaina 1990. This dvd is worth it for that extra plus alot of good matches, although its a little over blown. I cannot tell the differnces between this dvd and the other one for sale.",1108166400,,753,4.347517730496454
8028978,5,B0002LXDYC,"My title review speaks for itself... Everything in this event was perfectly put together, there were comedic parts, music, momentum, and the fans were abosolutely stir crazy, and I mean CRAZY, you would never see more crazier fans in other wrestlemanias besides this one, it definitly blows the waters out with this one... I definitly without  shadow of a doubt get this one....",1106956800,,378,5.0
