3891092,5,B002AS461O,"My anticipation while waiting to get my copy was greatly satisfied after we watched the Chargers History DVD. We are huge Chargers fans and watching the DVD brought back some really great, old memories of the Chargers from my youth. Great videos, great pictures, great footage of the San Diego Super Chargers!!",1259280000,,310,4.980769230769231
3891093,3,B002AS461O,"I agree with Jeff Pipes, ""Why was the 1981 playoff game against Miami not included in this package? So much time is spent on this game in both main programs it would have been nice to watch the entire game afterwards. This omission is the only fumble in this DVD package"".

The ""Missing Rings"" programme was very welcome but let's face it, given the choice between a 45 minute puff piece on Junior Seau and profiles of Luis Castillo, Roman Oben et al, most of us would rather watch ""Epic in Miami"" - NFL Films' presentation of a game that would possibly win a contest for best game of all time.  This exclusion was disappointing.",1257984000,,629,4.460869565217391

3891095,5,B002AS461O,"On 9/9/09 a San Diego theater premiered the ~80 minute feature,
complete with Charger Girls and numerous Charger greats.
Watching this great film on the big screen with hundred of Bolt-heads
was awesome. It's brilliantly edited, with plenty for newer fans, but LOTS for
those of us whose #21 jersey has ""HADL"" on the back (still love ya, LT!).

So, I was delighted when I saw that Amazon's write-up said that
this item was 240 minutes. That means a great bonus feature on
the 1981 team, and lots of shorter extras on Lance, Dickie, Junior,
Charlie and more.

If you're a Charger fan (and have read this far) then you know that
we've suffered a lot over the years. Yes, repeated heartbreaks,
zero Lombardi trophies, and only one Super Bowl appearance, which,
is not even a happy memory. But one of the best things that this
package does, is remind (or for the newer fans, teach) one just how
much Charger football has contributed to the NFL. Sure, we don't
have any championships (unless you count '63, pre-merger)
but there is A LOT to be proud of. Between Sid Gillman and Don Coryell,
San Diego virtually taught the modern NFL how to throw the ball.
Dan Fouts may not have a ring, but breaking the all-time passing record
3 years in a row is a phenomenal achievement. Anyone who could watch
this film and not demand that Don Coryell be in the Hall of Fame, is nuts.

There are also great interviews...new ones, that will surprise you.

So, yes, an absolute must have. Long, long overdue.

My only complaint is that I was really hoping for a blu-ray version.
Admittedly, much of the film--from the '60s & '70s...and even '80s--
probably wouldn't really be improved in HD, given the source material...
but still...it's late 2009...new stuff should be offered in the best formats.
It crossed my mind to ding the score a bit for that...but decided that no,
this is a review of THIS product, in DVD format...and it's freakin' awesome!",1255305600,10,1930,4.648093841642229
3891096,5,B002AS461O,"A ""must"" for all CHARGER FANS !
It's taken 50 years .... but, well worth the wait !!
I loved it !!
GO CHAGERS !!!!!!!!!!!",1254528000,,121,3.88
3891097,4,B002AS461O,"Being a life long San Diego Chargers fan, I've been waiting forever for this release. It does not disappoint. The main program ""The Complete History of the San Diego Chargers"" logs in at one hour and forty minutes. The first part of the program covers the team in it's earliest days in L.A. to the move to San Diego. It covers all the great Chargers players during this era and covers our one lone championship title- the 1963/64 AFL Championship. The program then moves into the glorious 1970's and the birth of ""Air Coryell"" era. This part covers all the greats- Dan Fouts, Charlie Joiner, John Jefferson, Wes Chandler, Chuck Muncie, all the great offensive and defensive linemen of the era, and the great Rolf Benirschke. All the classic games of this era are covered, including the classic 1981 playoff game against Miami. Classic NFL stuff, to say the least. We then move into the 1990's and the failed Superbowl season. The program covers this era pretty quickly and, in my opinion, could have spent a few more minutes covering the team of that era. Junior Seau and Stan Humphries get the most coverage with a tiny portion on Natrone Means. Then we move into the present day team and how it was put together starting with the drafting of LaDainian Tomlinson. The rest of the program covers the modern day team up to last years playoff loss in Pittsburgh. All in all, it's a great program that covers most of everything and even manages to throw in lots of humor along the way.

The second main program (on disc 2) is ""America's Game- 1981 San Diego Chargers"". This 45 minute program covers the 1981 season in full detail. This is a GREAT program worth the cost of the DVD alone.

There are lots of bonus features on both discs. The longest being another 45 minute program- ""In Their Own Words- Junior Seau"", which is pretty cool to watch as it shows Junior off the field as well as on. There are multiple other bonus programs logging in at no more than 15 minutes each..with most being less than 6-7 minutes. They cover the following people- Don Coryell, Lance Alworth, Dickie Post, Luis Castillo, Romen Oben, Charlie Joiner and Dan Fouts.

The total running time of both the main programs along with all the bonus features is just about 4 hours of content. Not bad, but my only complaint is explained below.

Why was the 1981 playoff game against Miami not included in this package? So much time is spent on this game in both main programs it would have been nice to watch the entire game afterwards. This omission is the only fumble in this DVD package.

All in all this gets 4 out of 5 stars. Maybe even 4.5. It would have been a solid 5 out of 5 if that playoff game had been included. A must for all Chargers fans and anyone with a love for some of the NFL's glory days.",1254441600,10,2781,4.488142292490118

3891122,5,B002AS461O,"An excellent compilation which includes a second DVD 'Special Features' which focuses on
the story of Don Coryell.  It includes a lot of great quotes from his players including Fouts,
Bauer, Laz, etc.  If you are a Chargers fan, and I have been since they came to town in 1961
you will love this set.  All professionally taped, edited with excellent narrators.  Good stuff
from the 1995 trip to the Super Bowl in Miami also round out the collection!  Lots of 'Bang'
or should I say 'Chargers Cannon BOOM !' for the buck !",1401148800,,521,4.5

3891124,5,B002AS461O,"I enjoyed this film immensely. The film covers the history of the Chargers from their beginnings in 1960 until 2009. It thoroughly covers the major players and all the coaches who were involved with the team during that time period. I learned that the name ""Chargers"" was given to the team by the first team owner who was also the owner of the Hilton hotel chain company. He named them the ""chargers"" after one who charges transactions on their credit card. I preferred the earlier logo of the horse (a charger), but the lighting bolt symbol (as in an electric bolt or charge) is the best. I think the Chargers have the best looking uniforms in the NFL. They have had many talented players over the years, but have yet to win a Super Bowl championship. I'd like to see them do that and look good doing it in their good looking powder blue, yellow, and white uniforms.",1395619200,,867,4.493670886075949
3891125,4,B002AS461O,"This dvd set is packed with great footage of one of the most exciting organizations in pro football history. I have been a Chargers fan since about 2004 and always loved how elecyrifying their offense has always been, but I wasn't aware (before watching this) that the chargers were one of the very first teams to institute the passing attack offense. My only complaint would be that there isn't more footage of philip rivers and his major contribution in keeping the team relevant for the past half-decade even with the worst O-Line of the league and one of the worst defenses. But it dosen't affect my rating of the product because this product was released prior to this. Anyways, should delight Charger fans. Chargers =Super Bowl bound 2014-2015!",1393459200,,750,4.8671875
3891126,5,B002AS461O,"Features the history of the Chargers.  Their first year was in L.A., unsupported they moved to San Diego to play at Balboa Stadium. Former QB Jack Kemp speaks.  The coach is talked about and the team plays well, eventually winning the 1963 AFL Championship after losing to Houston two times.

Players are mentioned for their abilities.  They get a new stadium in 1967. Eventually they get a different coach, Johnny Unitas plays briefly but at 40-years of age he has little to offer.  In steps Dan Fouts and leads the team to victories and he goes to the Hall of Fame as coach Don Coryell leads the team.

Eventually a new owner, coach, and QB, they go to the Super Bowl for the 1994 season.  Junior Seau appears and thanks fans for for attending.  Ryan Leaf is briefly mentioned as well as Doug Flutie and Drew Brees. A collection of cards featuring players is shown so the players can realize who came before them and what they are a part of. Insightful. Contains everything it should about the history of the team.",1390608000,,1016,4.543956043956044
3891127,3,B002AS461O,"I wish the dvd included a Super Bowl Win...Oh wait my team sucks, & has never won a Super Bowl....

On a serious note, I do wish there was more in depth information on team and players. The dvd did not tell me anything I didn't already know.",1377043200,,241,4.020833333333333
3891128,5,B002AS461O,"This DVD does a superb job of capturing and presenting the excellence and excitement of the San Diego Chargers from their inception the the very near present. Excellent footage of the Chargers under Don Coryell, with great footage of his receiving core of John Jefferson, Wes Chandler, Charlie Joiner and tight end Kellen Winslow.

The defensive prowess was not overlooked either, and the great play of Fred Dean, Rodney Harrison and others is not highlighted as well.

The special features are good with extra time given to Lance Allworth, John Jefferson and Don Coryell among others. There is also a long and thorough feature of the entire 1981 season culminating in the epic playoff win against the the Miami Dolphins.

Great buy for the money.",1367193600,,747,4.96
3891129,5,B002AS461O,"Myself, I bought this DVD hoping that it wouldn't contain footage that I had seen before on my old VHS tape ""Legend of the Lightning Bolt.""  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  VERY good mix of old footage that was all new to me, and the best bonus of all in this set was the ""NFL Missing Rings"" story of the 1981 season.  I truly wish that NFL films would do an entire series of all of the Super Bowl teams that DIDN'T win the big one, because their stories seem to be much more compelling than those teams who ultimately attained victory (The 1969 Minnesota Vikings story on the ""Missing Rings"" set is my absolute fave).  Granted, the Chargers didn't make the Super Bowl that year, but what they went through the previous seasons leading up to 1981 is engaging to say the least.  I have always admired Dan Fouts as a QB, but after watching that piece, I really like him as a person now (Especially him telling the story of his hat that read ""MFIC"" . .but you'll have to see the DVD to find out that bit of info, as I won't divulge it in this review) because of the competitive nature of his that came out in that show.

If you want to know what the DVD contains after 1990, you'll have to read some of the other submissions, because on my end, I live in the past with regards to the NFL.  So anything I say regarding that would definitely have a negative slant to it. But if you're looking for great 60's, 70's & 80's footage from the Chargers, you may want to buy this.",1357084800,2,1478,4.201413427561837

3891131,5,B002AS461O,"I live in Brazil and less than one year I started getting interested in the NFL championship. Finding statistics from the NFL, I was very interested in knowing more about some teams, including the San Diego Chargers. The two discs of the History of the San Diego Chargers fully met my expectations. The film was very well produced, provides an adequate level of knowledge about the team, has the right time duration, neither too long nor too short, and presents some very interesting extras content.  I began to understand the commotion caused by the tragic death of Junior Seau, who was a great linebacker of the Chargers. I liked the product and point to the fans of San Diego and NFL football.",1342915200,,696,4.704918032786885
3891132,5,B002AS461O,"IT's the Chargers history in NFL FIlms form.  IT's great, runs about an hour and a half.  Includes a second disc on the classic game against the Dolphins.

Well worth the money spent, if only to see the excitement in my grandson's eyes when he opened the package.",1262390400,,323,4.161290322580645
3891137,4,B002AS461O,"I watched the video on the history of the Chargers. I'm not a die-hard Chargers' fan, but I truly learned a lot about the start of the old AFL, how the Chargers began their legacy in Los angeles before moving to San Diego, the original stars of the team, and the team in the 70's, 80's, and the current decade. It is a great video for the die-hard football fan.",1261353600,,361,4.171428571428572
8360134,5,B002AS461O,"The San Diego Chargers in 1978, with the arrival of coach Don Coryell, after replacing head coach Tommy Prothro, began what was one of the most exciting periods in Charger history, and  profootball. This was a time of prominence for the NFL when it consisted of 28 teams, and the AFC and NFC had the west, central, east divisions, unlike today. Air Coryell was led by QB Dan Fouts, hall of famer, and protected by a star offensive line that allowed him to throw to talented receivers Charlie Joiner (hall of famer), John Jefferson, tightend Kellen Winslow (hall of famer), and Wes Chandler, Games with their bitter rival the Oakland Raiders are shown, and the 1981 AFC Div playoff game in Miami, against the Dolphins, as stated, perhaps the greatest playoff game ever, and it was. The early birth of the Chargers began in 1959, with the new AFL under head coach Sid Gillman with star running backs Paul Lowe, and Keith Lincoln, QB Jack Kemp (later U.S. Congressman). Defensive tackle Ernie Ladd, end Earl Faison, and nine time Pro-Bowl offensive tackle Ron Mix. Winning the AFL championship in 1963 with QB Tobin Rote throwing to receiving great Lance Alworth (hall of famer). Later, in 65 QB John Hadl would throw to Alworth, and In 66, featured receiver Gary Garrison, half back Dickie Post, safety Kenny Graham, kick returner Leslie ""Speedy"" Duncan. Candid commentaries from players, along NFL films footage make this a must have for Charger fans, and enjoyable to watch.",1518393600,,1474,4.849206349206349
