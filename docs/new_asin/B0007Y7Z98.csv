8053987,5,B0007Y7Z98,"This is one of those obscure cartoons. I remember watching this for the first time when I was about maybe 7 or 8 years old on Nickelodeon. King Grizzle Beard was a fairy tale that just stood out in my head out of the countless episodes. There were a few others I remembered, but this one was by far the most memorable.

King Grizzle Beard is similar to a Cinderella story...but it's backwards. The princess is bratty and spoiled and judges everyone by their wealth and appearance. After offending pretty much EVERY prince in the realm, she is married off to a peasant where she must learn to live life as a penniless and humble woman with no privileges. I won't spoil the whole story, but it's definitely a fun little cartoon for all ages with very nice moral lessons. Personally, I prefer this tale over the Princess/Cinderella type of tales because the princess had to truly learn something and change her entire outlook on life before receiving any relief. Her beauty and breeding were worthless, so she had to rely on being a regular human being. I think that is a better message than a lot of the princess crap out there.",1348012800,,1126,4.54679802955665
