8743959,5,B01951HGLA,"It's nice to finally SEE more of these unique B&W paper/art films of the past from H & B. However, I don't understand why they added one of the H&B films from the ""Hoffnung"" series, especially since it was already issued on the double H&B DVD ""So British"". Also, while I'm grousing [ha ha] I wished THIS had been a 2 DVD set with more Snip & Snap episodes...... So, will there be ANOTHER Snip & Snap DVD volume 2? I hope so. I'm looking forward to it.",1464220800,,451,4.136363636363637
