7441991,5,B015JLUO5A,"Humans is a very well made miniseries, set in a parallel world the same as ours, with the one exception, robots are commonplace and not just a part of the furniture, but available for purchase to perform household duties or for organisations to use as employees, in both cases doing the jobs that humans look down their noses at and avoid.  Of course this means kids in school are wondering what the point of some of their so called tertiary options are when pretty much every job can be done (and done more efficiently) by a robot, so who will be employing them?  Humans doesn't go into a great deal of depth tackling that subject, we see a few protest rallies against the machines and things like this.  I imagine if they ever do a second season they could tackle some of these issues a bit more (this one does wrap up the story lines but it's such a good show I could see demand bringing viewers back to this alternative world).

There's two main plots that we follow, one set in a regular family home where with the mother and wife (Katherine Parkinson, The IT Crowd),is seen to be too committed to her job and never being home the husband decides to get the family a Synth to clean the house and take care of the children.  Of course the mother isn't real thrilled about this and resents Anita the Synth, she's clearly jealous of its relationship with her children, especially the youngest who prefers it to read to her and she wants it returned.  She also is paranoid that is out to get her.

The other plot is a fugitive robot type one, where an agent is trying to find a group of Synths that are more aware and not following the rules of the synths such as not being able to lie.  The show works as the acting is excellent, especially from those playing the synths.  All up the episodes go for just over six hours so you can start and finish this over two nights or so.",1450137600,3,1877,4.3247863247863245
7441992,5,B015JLUO5A,"A friend introduced me to this TV show and wow - I have to say that this is One of the best sci-fi shows I've seen in a long while.  But, I don't think this is the key element to the show.  I feel that the show focuses more on the human elements of life, and what it means to be human.  What does it mean to be sentient?  Does it mean flesh and blood?  Does it mean being able to think for One's self and have feelings?  Can a machine be sentient?  What does that mean for flesh and blood humans?  Is it the end of humanity as we know it?  Is it a good or bad direction to head in?  Is it possible to truly care for a synth the same way that you'd care for a fellow human?

This is a truly thought provoking show on so many levels.

This show may not be everyones ""cuppa tea"", but I feel that you'd be a poorer person for not watching this show and thinking about some of the key elements presented in the show.

Absolutely recommended to anyone who cares for quality in a show.",1444435200,3,978,3.9035532994923856

7441996,5,B015JLUO5A,"This is a marvelous series. It cleverly explores all the human emotions. It's well written and well acted. My only complaint is that Amazon includes the first 2 seasons for free with Prime and once they get you hooked, charge for the third season. Netflix never does that.

7442004,5,B015JLUO5A,"A very intelligent and plausible sci-fi show that explores the dilemma that  society faces as we press forward with artificial intelligence and robotics. Combine this prescient show with what we already  see  occurring with people preferring virtual reality to actual reality.  The creepy introduction of  sex robots that we increasingly hear about in the news makes 'Humans' a very timely and relevant show.  We're already on the slippery slope. Boundaries are being crossed.

'Humans' can even be a bit unnerving when I catch myself rooting for the robots as the protagonists  and then  consider other excellent shows such as 'Battlestar Gallactica'  and the 'Terminator'  that deal with the Singularity (artificial intelligence systems becoming  self-aware and acting in their own self interest).",1529971200,,799,5.512396694214876

7442012,5,B015JLUO5A,"While not a sci fi junkie, this is not the first sci fi series I've been drawn to, but it's one of the most thought provoking and entertaining series of any genre that I've seen (on par with Orphan Black). But to judge the series on genre alone is a great injustice to the message the show is trying to convey. The story lines and subplots of Season 1 and Season 2  certainly have their flaws, the degree of which will depend on the subjective criteria of the viewer. For me, the most compelling aspect of this series is the unique manner in which the show runners created a view of world through ""synths"" that showcases what true ""humanity"" really is.  If you enjoy sci fi, this series is worth a look. If you enjoy the constant mystery that is humanity, this series is will not disappoint.",1528243200,,791,4.374149659863946

7442014,2,B015JLUO5A,"Season 1 was great.  However, I don't know what happened to season 2.  It's like a fresh batch of writers was brought in and not a one of them had any exposure to season 1 before sitting down to write.  Characters seemed, in a way, to become more muddled or perhaps the victims of change for change's sake.  I don't know if that makes sense. I do know that I'm going to give season 3 a chance though.  After all, each season of Humans only has 8 episodes.  I remember ""back in the day"" that Star Trek: Next Generation had a rough season 1 and that was when viewers could count on 26 or so episodes per season for pretty much any show.  That's a lot of time for characters to smoothly evolve or fix mistakes.",1527552000,,707,4.154411764705882

In time we begin to see flaws in the programming (much like Windows 10) that never go away but become more and more exacerbated (much like Windows 10) but unlike Windows 10 there are heartfelt and tender moments that allow us to connect with the Synths as you would imagine from any story of this type.",1523577600,,618,4.731481481481482

7442054,5,B015JLUO5A,"Season 1 was very good but this is even better.

My favorite genre of science fiction: sentient AI. What happens if and when it happens? How would humans treat human-looking androids? Of course we would treat them as slaves and make them do the jobs we don't want to do. Human nature will never change in this regard and we won't treat ""synths"" any better than slaves. And we will justify our behavior by telling ourselves synths have no emotions or self-awareness. They're not ""human"". Kind of like an Alexa who can clean your toilets for you.

Some child characters start to emulate their synth companions for obvious reasons: synths never get angry, they are always kind, they are never afraid. One synth, rescued from a junkyard eventually ""offs"" himself because he can no longer provide services or ""usefullness"" anymore. Very emotional and touching.

But what happens when the synths start to ""wake up""? This is the premise of the series. And it makes for intrigue and drama. There is even an ""evil"" synth who adds fear and horror to the story. Very enjoyable. Better than most on Prime. Season 1 was good but this is better. Looking forward to season 3.",1522108800,,1160,4.732673267326732

My GOD- some of the BEST sci-fi writing of ALL time let alone in comparison with other current sci-fi work.
Somehow...the show isolates the difference between machine...and the unique elements that make US human...while still demonstrating the fully functional nature of synthetic consciousness.

I have perhaps never been so stimulated, both emotionally and intellectually, by a series. Everyone- well f***ing done. And THANK you-! What a wonderful gift...to be alive, to see the sun set and rise...and to be able to watch things like ""Humans"".... :) Much love to the team.

7442097,4,B015JLUO5A,"Doesn't really hit its stride until the last three episodes of this season which really sets up the anticipation of what is going to happen in Season 3 (no spoiler but oh boy, unleash the hounds!). Laura (who I couldn't really stand in Season 1) is so much better this season but oddly her husband is duller than before. I do have an issue with the Niska storyline as it seems to be shunted aside way too much. We need Niska onscreen way more. (There is an extra showing how she does the chase scene so that's nice.)

The extras here are so-so. They are all pretty short. There's a Making Of, A Look At The Series, New Characters, Niska's Escape (how the stunts were shot but, honestly, there's nothing super spectacular about the chase scene at all) and Greeting From The Set. There's also a long uncut with natural sound B-Roll Behind The Scenes of some different location shoots that goes on almost 30 minutes for some reason.

However, I am very pleased to finally have given it a chance and hit that play button on episode 1. To be honest, my expectations were not very high and boy was I pleasantly surprised!

Now what happens when they become sentient and become so human like that you cant tell if they are androids or not. They would be stronger, faster and perhaps even more intelligent.

I won't ruin the show with details of the storyline and plot but this is a good series. I really liked season 1 and this season 2 is also pretty good. It is a good Sci-Fi story. It does not have a lot of special effects but it is a near reality that might wake you up to what the near future may/will hold for us all.

7442186,5,B015JLUO5A,"This is a brilliant, extremely well done show that seems to remain a hidden gem. There is a reason for the title, as this series,  through its examination of Artificial Intelligence and the ramifications of the widespread use of very advanced Androids in an alternate reality version of our own contemporary society,  examines and illuminates what it means to be human.  It is both intelligent and moving, with interesting plot twists, characters we care about, and a good degree of suspense.
William Hurts season one performance is nuanced and touching, and perhaps one of his best.
The entire cast, however,  is quite brilliant and the writing is first class.",1515974400,16,661,5.036697247706422

7442191,5,B015JLUO5A,Humans: Season 2 was very good. Better than Season 1 I thought. More thought provoking and well scripted.

The writers were very good at bringing this out as the story progressed from the first one and two episodes and all the way to the ending. Can't wait for Season 3.,1515715200,,411,4.5675675675675675

7442203,4,B015JLUO5A,"Knock knock.  Who's there?  It's just me, Mollie the Synthetic Psychopath.  (Actually, it's just me banging my head against the wall.)

SPOILER ALERT!

So, after weighing the consequences for a few seconds, a teenager still living with her parents basically decides to give the atomic bomb to Imperial Japan a year before the Manhattan Project.  All she did was unleash on humanity a physically/mentally superior race that's no better morally than humans.  Of course, the smartest computer scientists in the world with billions in corporate and government resources can't crack the consciousness code, but 'Mattie' cracks it on her MacBook?  And the global synth network is an open wiki?  Anybody can upload to the network, even after the killer synth uprising at Qualia?

I only point out these nitpicks to show how fantastically weird the Hawkins family is in 'Humans.'  The mother Laura endangers the lives of her family, who in any other sci-fi dystopia -- and probably in real life, too -- would have been executed by CIA agents or renditioned to Guantanamo on national security grounds way back in Episode Six of Season 1. But in this story, the government just sends a synthetic cable guy to scare her off.  The same government is looking for Niska everywhere on Earth -- but doesn't think to check her ex-girlfriend's house?  That's Terminator 101 surveillance strategy:  ""Negative. The T-1000 would definitely try to reacquire you there.""

Nevertheless, I really enjoyed 'Humans' because the truth is, in real life, there are human beings who act just like the Hawkins.  We used to call them 'Flower People.'  The keenest point in the story is when Laura realizes the conscious synths act just like real humans.  As Super Artificial Intelligence goes, they aren't especially bright.  Again and again, the synths fall for traps a $20 chess computer would see through, let alone Big Blue, let alone the Singularity.  The backdoor isn't locked -- gee, maybe it's electrified?  That's about as clever as a mousetrap, but the Singularity grabs the doorknob and blows out its circuits.  Nothing the synths try to do ever works.  All their plans go to pot!  These synthetic humans are as scatter-brained and hapless as the Keystone Cops -- i.e., the beautiful mirror image of humanity.",1515369600,4,2287,5.0212765957446805

7442206,4,B015JLUO5A,"(Tiny Spoiler Alert: Though the alert might not be worth mentioning--some of you will not notice the spoilers or care--I thought I'd warn you anyway.) The actors are believable and enjoyable to watch. All of the robot characters are played well; however, my favorite are Mia, Max, Odi and the child. The story is interesting, with nice twists and turns, even though it is the old tale of robots vs. humans (i.e. oppressed vs. oppressor). As always, conflicts and divisions surface on both sides as everyone, led by their own beliefs and experiences, attempts to facilitate their version of what the world should be or will be. Some parts of the plot need more thorough explanations and developments or else this series will become a violent (I don't think the series need the gory blood) and cheesy sci-fi drama that will not make sense. Also, the tension in some relationships arrives too soon or is forced. These flaws did not deter me from wanting to find out what happened in the next scene or episode. Overall, this series is thoughtful and entertaining with a talented cast. Episode eight ended in a smart place. If the writers are careful to maintain consistent characters with believable, unrushed and thought-out story lines, Season Three can be equally satisfying, if not a bit more, and may possibly redeem what was lost in this season.",1515196800,3,1347,4.860869565217391
7442207,5,B015JLUO5A,"Good thoughtful SciFi.  Not sporting much in the way of special effects, this will get you thinking about how humans will be affected by advances in technology.

As a software developer I actually think that some of what people are worried about -- including a lot of the problems depicted here -- is off base, but it's still good fun and interesting to talk about.

7442209,3,B015JLUO5A,"The well-worn theme of AI robots vs. humanity fails like they usually do to address motive. Why would machines, who lack the biological imperative to reproduce, and the bonding and family that goes with it, ever want to overtake humanity? Why would any ""machine"", no matter how much stronger or smarter than humankind, really care whether they were turned on or off? This never gets addressed in this now dog-eared genre. 'Humans' never convinced me that the synths were anything more than cleverly written robots, an anthropomorphic illusion common to humans.

After watching just 4 episodes, I decided to purchase the entire series (Humans and Humans 2.0) on Blu-ray Disc because it's simply that good. This is yet another example of how offering original and free content can often lead to a huge following and ultimately future purchases.

7442271,5,B015JLUO5A,"Humans 2.0.  The second series of this  television production, made for the United Kingdoms BBC 4 station, broadcast in the United States on AMC stations in February 2017, is now in release, with a third already commissioned.  A science fiction thriller that has been compared toWestworld, been BAFTA nominated for Best Drama Series, it creates a world set in the UK, in roughly the current day. But in an alternate universe where synthetic robots, known as synths, are the latest must-have gadgets for  busy families.  In this British drama, these 'synths', highly developed robotic servants, are eerily similar in appearance to humans, have many abilities long considered  restricted to humans. Accordingly, the synths  share human homes,  jobs, lives, become objects of  fear, hatred, lust, love.  This ultimate A.I. experiment (The Atlantic), based  on the award-winning Swedish science fiction drama Real Humans, explores the intersection of man and machine.

Some time after saying goodbye to Mia, their former synth, who has become conscious,  a gorgeous green-eyed young woman (Gemma Chan, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), the Hawkins family struggles to put the emotionally draining past behind them, searches for some semblance of normality. Lawyer Laura (Katherine Parkinson, The IT Crowd),her businessman husband Joe (Tom Goodman-Hill, Mr. Selfridge, The Secret Agent) try marriage counseling,  become concerned over their daughters (Pixie Davies, Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children) synth-like behavior. But when the conscious synth Niska (Emily Berrington, 24: Live Another Day), a perfect beauty who had been designed as an entertainment model, revolted against that work in the first series, unexpectedly arrives at their home, the family finds themselves again drawn into the continuing life and death battles being waged by their conscious synth friends.

As synths begin to gain consciousness all over the world, their emotional capabilities expand. They are pushed to the limit as they confront major moral questions about their place in the universe of humanity. A mysterious organization starts hunting them. Synth leaders Leo (Colin Morgan, The Fall), Max (Ivanno Jeremiah, The Hollow Crown) disagree heatedly over how to protect  those conscious like themselves. Renowned AI scientist (Carrie-Anne Moss, The Matrix trilogy) joins a global tech company that prepares to release a revolutionary new product.  Will Tudor (Game of Thrones), Sonya Cassidy (The Paradise), Sam Palladio (Nashville) costar in this compelling ensemble entertainment, in which the characters are well-drawn, and developed, emotionally resonant, highly-involving. The story is tight, gripping, action-filled, binge-worthy.

Acorn TV sent me an early copy of this box set in expectation of an honest, unbiased review.  It consists of eight episodes on three discs, totaling approximately 394 minutes plus an exceptionally generous 56 minute behind the scenes featurette.  Subtitles, very welcome, of course.  It does contain coarse language, nudity, sexual situations, violence, perhaps only for viewers at least 15 years old.  Am not normally a sci-fi fan; only thing in that genre I have ever liked is the 1980s era Blade Runner and Harrison Ford had a lot to do with that.  But I loved the first series of this genre-breaking  thriller, which I reviewed on its own website; I similarly love the second series.  Maybe because women largely carry the story.  And because, at its heart, its about family, the most important subject in the world.",1509840000,,3558,5.494485294117647

The Hawkins couple lawyer Laura (Katherine Parkinson Doc Martin) & Joe (Tom Goodman-Hill Mr Selfridge), in counseling, try to recover. Synths (Synthetic robots, ai but lifelike) enlightened to conscious hide. Hesters a new synth gone rogue, and Sonya Cassidy (The Paradise) plays that dark side well. Carrie-Anne Moss joins the cast as an American ai scientist with her own agenda. Danny Webb (Scott & Bailey Land Girls) and Aidan McCardle (Mr Selfridge The Mill) also appear. Writing makes it astonishing-the acting makes it believable, outlandish, but believable.

7442291,5,B015JLUO5A,"I agree with most of the reviews that see this an exploration of our possible future with AI, but it is so much more than that.  How do we treat those we view as different?  What is the role of violence in social change?  Will hate  of injustice corrupt even the purest drives for justice? Do hard times lead us to draw harder lines between ""us"" and everyone else?

It is also about relationships, the different types of love, the meaning of family,  and the variety of different destructive ways to deal with emotional trauma.

With all the trauma it explores, in the end it is NOT dystopian.  It does not call on us to fight or even fear the future.  It does not scapegoat or stereotype ""evil"" corporations, scientists, or politicians.  There is much evil done by each of those categories, but not with evil intent.

7442297,5,B015JLUO5A,"So well done. The way they got the actors who played robot A.I. synths to move is explained in the DVD extras and worth checking out. In fact, get the DVD for tons of extras (if a bit repetitive) to learn more about the series as there's about an episode's worth in the extras. As far as sci-fi goes it's a pretty compelling Bladerunner/Westworld replicant type scenario done in the near future where the UK now has slave synths doing most of the grunt work. Getting William Hurt in this, I guess, helped sell the series, but it's the British actors playing the synths that are the stars.

The only character I did not get was Laura Hawkins. First of all, why cast her as a lawyer with weird bangs from the 1970s. A doctor would have been a far better choice when dealing with the synths and could have been played for more drama. Worse though is I found her just plain annoying. Was she supposed to be played that way? I get the husband and the kids start feeling distant from her, but she'd drive me crazy with that voice of hers. Sorry, actress Katherine Parkinson, I just did not dig what you brought to the table for this.

Also, this is only eight episodes in Season 1 so it's easy to bang this out in a few days. The whole thing wraps up after Season 2 and is based on the two-season Swedish original TV series called ""Real Humans"" for you sci-fi trivia buffs.",1504224000,,1367,4.315175097276264

7442339,5,B015JLUO5A,"Humans is a 2015 British television series, which is a combination of a science fiction thriller and a family drama. It is based on the award-winning Swedish science fiction drama entitled Real Humans, and has a very similar plot. This second season of Humans continues its central story line depicting the turmoil in a British family that has resulted from their acquisition of a domestic robot, known as a Synth, ostensibly to help with routine household tasks, such as cooking, cleaning, and doing the laundry. This is the primary story arc, but there are several other concomitant stories, which are interwoven within the central narrative. Season 2 focuses on the spread of consciousness and sentience throughout the Synth population of the world, and the tremendous turbulence and conflict that have resulted from this cataclysmic and transformational development. Humans features truly superb writing, plot development, and character development, and it maintains an atmosphere of mystery, intrigue, and suspense. It is highly thought-provoking, as it examines the fundamental characteristics of the human condition, in comparison to the features of humanoid robots with artificial intelligence, who purportedly are just anthropomorphic, but not actually sentient, and not capable of true feelings and emotions. This series also stimulates its viewers to contemplate the societal, philosophical, and ethical ramifications of the development of such technologically-advanced robots, which can so closely replicate human characteristics and qualities, that they have become virtually indistinguishable from real people. I was so captivated and enthralled by this second season of Humans, that I stayed up very late one night, and watched all eight episodes consecutively. I found it to be a decidedly engaging and entertaining television program, as well as being extremely interesting, intelligent, and thought-provoking. Humans is an absolutely outstanding science fiction thriller and family drama series, that features excellent writing, plot development, and acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with a very enthusiastic recommendation.",1498608000,10,2181,5.84012539184953

With the advent of new technology in robotics and artificial intelligence, these androids may be not that far away in our future.  This series shows both the pros and cons to these technologies by in people's everyday lives.  It also throws in a few ""surprises"" that makes you say, ""Whoa!  I didn't see that coming!""  The entire story board has several plots, but they play together to make the movie series run smoothly and keeping your interest.

As always, the conflict between human and machine priorities serve as allegories for struggles around human prejudice, injustice, and desire for liberty. Some of the episodes are remarkably good, some seem to lack the cohesiveness to fully help the watcher to suspend disbelief. A for effort (sci-fi is not easy for the actors; I think they really worked hard on this one) and C for overall production quality, which is patchy.

7442384,3,B015JLUO5A,"[I've only watched the first (and 1/2) episodes, so there are no real spoilers here].
I do not quite understand what they are trying to get at with their heavy-handed morality--  specifically about the blonde who is working in the brothel.  Yes there are 6 special synths which have consciousness and can truly ""feel"" -- which begs the question of what it means to be human.  However, from the beginning, it seems we are supposed to feel the same revilement for ALL the synths, even the ones who do NOT have any sort of consciousness or feelings, which truly are machines.  We are supposed to revile the man who enters and tells her ""panties down, not off"" and understand her angst at being ""disenfected"" and told that there would be another John in 5 minutes.

But really, should we? That man has paid to use and ""humiliate"", if that, what he believes is a machine, with no feelings, pride or human dignity.  I would understand this sentiment if the situation was the inverse-- he went to a human brothel and instead was given a Synth.  But, in his mind, he is using a sex toy -- no different than a vibrating back massager.  I get it -- she isn't one, but if the whole point is that there are only 6 special Synths that are ""different""-- then the rest of them really are machines, and what he is doing is not immoral unless you believe masterbation with toys is immoral because it debases the TOYs.  (The issue of whether it debases the human-- that is, is relying on the Synths to the extent that this world does IS a valid ethical issue and one likely to be a main point in the series). But the show seems to have missed the mark with the way they are presenting this moral issue and it is marring my enjoyment of this interesting world.",1494547200,,1741,4.398753894080997

7442463,5,B015JLUO5A,"SLAVERY IS NOT OK. HOW ABOUT a life-sized doll that walks, talks, does our dirty work, looks and acts human? A plastic-electronic person, not knit in the womb by nature, rather synthesized in a factoryan it, not him or hera tool, at our disposal. It talks, but it doesnt talk back, the way our offspring do.

Id buy it.

Then again, AMCs original series, Humans, Season 1, makes us think twice about the assorted human/synth interaction issues that are fast coming our way.

How do we define what it means to be human? Science fiction writers have hammered this concept skin-thin, with knock-offs and imitations of Phillip K. Dick novels and Blade Runner movies. With this TV series, however, Aesops familiarity breeds contempt does not apply. The premise is familiar, but the execution is fresh. A stellar cast makes Humans compelling and engaging, with actors from a variety of classic, award-winning TV shows and movies (The Imitation Game, Flyboys, Game of Thrones, Merlin, Live Another Day, and more.)

The premise: in the near future, science has enabled the manufacture and sale of incredibly life-like humanoid servants, called Synthetics, synths, dolls, or dollies. Like buying a vacuum cleaner or dishwasher, buying a synth servant or maid is just what todays busy families need to simplify their lives.

Thats what the ads promise, anyway.

A working mom, Laura (Katherine Parkinson), comes home from a business trip and finds another woman has taken over the duties shes been neglecting. Her husband Joe (Tom Goodman-Hill) has bought a synthetic housewife (Gemma Chan). Polite, competent, beautiful, the dolly does all the cooking, cleaning, ironing, and errand runningyes, she can even drivebetter than a distracted mother can. She listens with undivided attention to the youngest daughters chatter and reminds the teenagers whats on their calendars. She doesnt have a name, until the children come up with Anita.

Wouldnt any wife be thrilled to have all this extra help?

Laura feels displaced. Sure, Humanoid Synthetics are an inextricable part of society, serving and protecting humans, but Joe shouldnt have made such a life-altering purchase without consulting her. Joe, poor lovable schmuck, was stressed out from managing the fort and all three kids without Laura. Also, Laura has always been a bit cool and distant, an excuse husbands everywhere use to justify for doing certain things without their wives.

Lauras detachment had something to do with a guy named Tom, but thats a subject she never discussed. Too bad; it might have kept her husband from making another major mistake, through all the misunderstandings and conflicts.

It doesnt take long for Anita to endear herself to the family and start becoming real, kinda like The Velveteen Rabbit. Not that being loved by a child makes the dolly human, but the AIs interactions with humans allow it/her to learn and evolve.

Still, Laura cant shake her unease or the feeling that something about Anita is seriously amiss. The oldest child has the computer skills to look deeper into Anitas code and find anomalies. Anita is not a brand-new model, as advertised. She has a history. And another identity. Most of the time its hidden, until Mia sometimes breaks free of Anita to make a brief plea for help. But what kind of help can the Hawkins family offer a seemingly human persona hidden inside a synth?

Another storyline revolves around retired synth engineer George (William Hurt), widowed, struggling with memory loss, and told he must retire his out-of-date synth. Odi (Will Tudor) is more than a caretaker. He remembers everyone in Georges life, which makes him a companionable and welcome conversationalist. When George struggles to recall something, Odi fills in the blanks. A new synth could never replace the beloved but malfunctioning Odi, nor are there enough years left in Georges life for that kind of relationship to evolve again.

I love Odi!

Theres a connection between George and the mysterious Leo (Colin Morgan), who is on a mission with his synth, Max, to find someone whos gone missing. Max is different from other synths in ways that Leo has kept secret, but its getting harder to hide the humanity of the nonhumans who share Maxs secret. Leo is the leader of a small family of synths who have been specially engineered to have feelings, emotions, sentience, and free will. Asimovs Laws of Robotics are often mentioned, but this rogue group transcends those laws.

Millions of synths walk the streets, work in hotels and businesses, drive, and blend in with everyone else. If broken or damaged, they bleed blue. Their inhumanly blue eyes distinguish synths from humans, but these eyes can be disguised with contact lenses.

Okay, I can believe AIs learn from interactions with humans, evolve, and begin to seem human, but who would mistake a synthetic coworker for a human? Just as vinyl cant pass for leather, and discriminating women everywhere know cotton from polyester, it defies credulity to suggest a machine-made person could pass for an organic human. We must willingly suspend disbelief, never mind that these machines masquerading as humans never have to scratch an itch, belch, yawn, pass gas, sneeze, and such.

Synths may not need to eat, drink, and find restrooms to flush the byproducts, but in this show, they do need to plug in at the nearest public charging station, using what looks like oversized versions of a cell phone charger. In a future where man-made robots can pass for human, less cumbersome methumanshods would be expectedwe already have wireless phone chargersbut it makes for a good visual.

Techno-issues pale in importance beside the thing that makes this show so riveting: the way contemporary social issues are woven in, quietly, with a feather not a hammer. Human trafficking, workers being replaced by technology, xenophobia, its all there.

We are people, rioting, picketing humans shout. They fear the synths are taking jobs away and making people irrelevant.

One of the most disturbing scenes is the sale of tickets to people who get to swing a baseball bat at synths. Its so violent, so inhumane, even though the humanoids are only synthetic and don't have feelings. Anyone who paid attention in history class will remember when Native Americans and slaves were said to be less than human, devoid of feelings.

NOTE: Go to www perihelionsf dot com for my full review.

Humans is a fascinating series, well written and beautifully acted. The picture quality is as good as Blu-ray can get. It's nice to see vivid colors after so many years of the trendy, filtered, gray, or sepia tones that have dominated the cinematic landscape. Touching and thought provoking, Humans is good drama and good science fiction, focused less on special effects or physical violence, more on ethics and emotions.

Now, do I pre-Order Season 2 and binge-watch when it comes, or do I watch an episode a week...",1489536000,,6932,5.034934497816594

7442465,4,B015JLUO5A,"Humans has now completedSeasons One and Two. This comes from the UK (though it also has some USfunding) and the original story
came from a Swedish project. This is another take on the now quite popular theme of artificial intelligence. Here, the connection to
real-world issues is immediately apparent. In the not so distant future, a corporation is producing androids. Mass producing. As if automation and computers hadn't eliminated enough jobs, now androids are capable of doing quite a large amount of work formerly done by humans. The upside of course is a lot of really boring or outright dangerous jobscan be filled that way, but the downside is rapidly swelling unemployment. And then--there's that artificial intelligence thing. One of the designers of the android brain has truly succeeded in creating conscious, thinking and feeling androids (feeling in both senses of that word--all our physical senses, enhanced, as well as emotions). At first there's only a handful, which he creates to enhance hisown somewhat lonely existence. But the nature of inventions being what it is, knowledge spreads, and in season two,
more truly aware androids are appearing in the story.
As season two ends, one of the androids (a quite attractive blonde and blue-eyed female named ""Mishka"") has asked to be put on trial for a crime with the same rights as a human being--and the government provisionally agreed, if an initial hearing concludes that she actually is conscious.

""Humans"" does not need a lot of high-tech computer graphics or expensive sets, so it is able to do very good things with a reasonable budget.  It seems to have had a budget of only $14 million for the first season [though those were probablypounds sterling, notUS dollars). It managed to score a very respectable 8.1 for season one; final ratings for the second season aren't in yet.

It seems to have slanted a bit more toward the problems of automation threatening employment, than the more abstract issues about ascertaining consciousness, how similar or different ""artificial"" intelligence might be from our own, etc.--but that's not to say these are ignored, by any means. My favorite couple of scenes from the two seasons were some pieces of dialog between Niska and a co-creator of the androids, over issues like ascertaining consciousness, right & wrong, nature and nurture among other things. There is some fine writing and acting going on in the series. This is worth checking out. I give this a B+ for the two seasons overall. It's impossible to deny the relevance of the underlying issues. I finished
one episode of Humans and switched over to CNN, which immediately had a story predicting that in a decade, perhaps 50% of truck driver jobs will have been replaced by self-driving vehicles!  I hope they keep up the good work for a third season.",1489276800,12,2829,5.0

Intercourse (sexual) with a robot is widely postulated among science fiction aficionados as preferable to the popular inexpensive inflatable sex-toy love doll or even the new generation of high-end sex doll (poseable mannequins) in contemporary use. However moral decency by today's standards envisages a future where any such act be consensual. If it is preferable to making love with a human?... is subject of much debate. It depends on the robot, for example Rachael with whom Harrison Ford had an affair in Blade Runner would have all the men east of the Mississippi lined up for their turn.

7442524,5,B015JLUO5A,"I bought this Blu-Ray as a blind buy, and it is -- without question -- the best blind buy I've ever made.

I've never seen the original series this was based on, but I have seen Blade Runner and its influences are felt here.  Dramatically, it's compelling to the point that I (a hardcore science fiction junkie) and my wife (who doesn't like TV) felt compelled to watch the entire series in the space of two nights.  This is a drama, not an action-adventure, and it does a superb job of telling a story while staying grounded.  It is one of the very best science fiction shows on TV (I'd put it in my top 5) and I cannot wait to watch the second season when the uncut UK episodes come to Blu-Ray.

As far as the picture quality, it's about as close to perfect as you can get on Blu-Ray.  Splendid colors for an expertly-shot series.  The audio mix isn't showy, but the high quality is appreciated for the magnificent score that underlies the series.  Special features are interesting enough, though likely not something you'll go through more than once.  I do wish the Channel 4 ""Persona Synthetic"" advertisement made it on the Blu-Ray, as that would have been a nice easter egg.  (You can look it up, as well as a new one promoting Season 2 on YouTube if you're so inclined.)

If there's anything negative to say (there isn't) it's that I wish there was more!

7442527,3,B015JLUO5A,"A bleak and humorless look at subject matter better handled by the original Swedish series in nearly every possible way. While it deals with the same topic and typically mirrors the story line, 'Humans' abandons the sometimes good-natured whimsy of 'Real Humans' (Akta Manniskor) and combines essential characters from the original series in an attempt to streamline the cast to the detriment of both characters.

Another in a long list of examples of British drama with no sense of humor or timing about how everything is terrible and we are all going to be miserable, get divorced, and die alone, this time set in a near future world.

The better series:

The range of issues, as with good scifi, can also intellectually substitute for current issues such as human trafficking, but without preachiness.

7442565,5,B015JLUO5A,"Humans, Season 1.  This British television series was broadcast in the United States on AMC channels in the summer of 2015, is based on the award-winning Swedish science fiction drama REAL HUMANS. It is from the makers of Utopia and Broadchurch.  A second season is in production.  The science fiction thriller is set in the near future, when technological advances have brought about the creation of life-like humanoid robot servants, called Syntheticsor synthsthat help busy families simplify their lives.

Joe Hawkins (Tom Goodman-Hill, THE IMITATION GAME, MR. SELFRIDGE), is disheartened by the distance of his lawyer wife, Laura (Katherine Parkinson, DOC MARTIN, THE IT CROWD), and the indifference of his children. He purchases a synth with the hope that it will ease the familys struggles. The remarkably kind, beautiful synth, Anita (Gemma Chan, JACK RYAN: SHADOW RECRUIT) is an instant hit with the children. But Joes wife Laura cant shake her unease, the feeling that something is very wrong with Anita. While the Hawkins family adjusts to life with Anita, retired synth engineer George (Oscar winner William Hurt, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, BROADCAST NEWS) cant bring himself to get rid of his beloved, but malfunctioning synth, Odi (Will Tudor, GAME OF THRONES). And mysterious Leo (Colin Morgan, MERLIN) desperately searches for someone with his synth, Max. The production also stars Danny Webb (VALKYRIE, LANDGIRLS), Neil Maskell (UTOPIA), Ruth Bradley (FLYBOYS), and Emily Berrington (24: LIVE ANOTHER DAY, THE INBETWEENERS 2).

The box set consists of three discs containing eight episodes for approximately 485 minutes, and contains  the uncut UK edition of the production, restoring the 20 minutes cut for the AMC showing.  It also has closed captions, thank goodness, plus features the Making of Humans (7 mins.), behind the scenes featurette (42 mins.) and photo gallery.  Beware, it contains violence, coarse language, nudity and sexual situations: its not for children, or the sensitive. I received this as a review copy.

Well, theres no question in my mind but that the series descends from the great 1982 BLADE RUNNER; its concerns are the same.  Thought provoking and thrilling, the drama explores the intersection of man and machine. The vulnerability of those who are different.  The question of in what humanity resides.  And from these elements another fine SF thriller has been made.  Of course, I always love female-centered drama, and this is, but it is in addition well-written, well-acted, gripping.  As George, William Hurt delivers a touching performance.  Emily Berrington, as Niska, the 2015 version of Daryl Hannahs Pris in BLADE RUNNER, both female robots designed for sex slavery who have developed feelings about their situations, and Gemma Chan as Anita are suitably beautiful, with relatively inexpressive doll-like faces perfect for the parts.  We did not know what to make of this when it went into the DVD player, but found ourselves heavily involved, following the twists and turns of the plot with glued-to-the-screen attention.  Binge watched as best modern life allows.",1458950400,22,3117,5.315682281059063
7442566,5,B015JLUO5A,"We are always interested in the idea of life-mimicking machines, automatons and artificial intelligence that can compete with human life.  In this series the story not only explores the humans who have the use of synthetics or synths but viewers learn of  a group of synths who have been built with feelings, emotions, reactions, so perfectly engineered they could be human.  We learn what it is like to BE a synth......The Asimov laws of robotics are often mentioned as a governing principle built in to synths, but we soon learn that the rogue group with feelings are not following those laws.  It is a fascinating, well written series, which leaves the viewer with a sadness for everyone, the humans who need the synths, the non emotional synths for what they are missing, and the synths with feelings who seem to be at odds with the whole world.  Since this is Season 1, we are curious to see what will happen next.......what is judged real, and living....I can't help but think of Data the character in Star Trek the Next Generation, who was artificial, but who wanted to be real....we went through many stories of good Data and bad Data, but we saw him exhibit qualities of love and mercy, writing poetry to his cat Spot, and ultimately proven ""alive"".  Like the moments on Data's journey to beling ""alive"" there are many touching and thought provoking moments in this Season one of Humans.  This series is good drama and good science fiction, something that isn't so focused on special effects or physical violence.  The sensitivity to the value of emotions, connection and living are an important part of the narrative.",1458691200,30,1627,4.806451612903226
7442567,5,B015JLUO5A,"HUMANS is a brilliant show.  I'm often lukewarm about sci-fi programs but this brilliant 8-episode series captured my full attention right off the (cricket) bat.  Sometimes with multi-episode programs like HUMANS we're content to watch one, maybe two episodes of an evening.  HUMANS had us hooked the way a good book won't let you put it down.  To complete the analogy, instead of being ""a real page turner"", HUMANS is a real ""let's watch just one more"" kind of a show.

HUMANS' overall themes are very basic--such as can man play God; what if machines could do the work of people--would they actually replace people? and even the most basic conflict ""if you eat of the fruit of the tree of Knowledge you will become like God"".  It doesn't get any more basic than that.  But in the hands of the creators of this series, everything takes on a fresh perspective.

For a program about supreme technology it's interesting and encouraging to see the direction be so unobtrusive.  There's no fancy in-your-face camera work that draws attention to itself.  It's good to see the director and producer trusted the strength of the script and the acting and thus eschewed the aforementioned technical distractions.

William Hurt surprisingly shows up as one of the wonderful ensemble of actors who inhabit HUMANS.  He is a health-compromised, lonely old inventor who originally had a hand in developing the most sophisticated of the ""synths"" as the robots are called.  The world-weariness he projects is truly moving as the majority of his interaction is with synths, not humans.

Katherine Parkinson is the central character in the series and she is light years away from her fine comedic work on DOC MARTIN.  She plays Laura Hawkins, a woman trying to maintain a balanced family life with her husband and three children, as well as a career as a lawyer and all the while hanging on to her dark secret.  She is deeply threatened when her husband, Joe, played by Tom Goodman-Hill, orders a synth to help around the house which will hopefully free up more time for him and Laura to re-connect in their marriage.  Of course the synth, Anita, played by the stunningly beautiful Gemma Chan is precisely that, stunningly beautiful, as well as amazingly efficient to the point of arranging youngest daughter Sophie's lunch to resemble an animal (some sort of dinosaur, I think).  Tensions mount and choices both good and destructive are made.  And this is but one story thread.

Each of the actors playing synths had their work cut out for them, eliminating the habits and mannerisms we all have as humans even to the point of eliminating too much blinking with their eyes.  We've all seen robots depicted before and the movements often seem to be mechanical in some way.  The whole point of HUMANS is that they have a minimum of mannerisms.  Of course there are some giveaways that they are what they are, such as some of them having metallic green eyes.  This is of course easily concealed with contact lenses when they want to pass as human, a major concern especially for Niska, played by another stunning beauty, Emily Berrington.  Originally seen working as a brothel synch, Niska rebels and has the opportunity to wreak genuine havoc, such is the force of her desire for restitution.  The scene where she enters a Smash Club--where humans come and pay money to let loose their hostilities on synths by beating them with heavy clubs--is especially well done.  It must have been a lot of fun for Ms Berrington to play such a violent scene, given that she starts off being victimized.

Questions of ethics, morality and what is good for mankind elevate HUMANS to the level of a real think-fest.  Yet at the same time it is excellent drama.  When you simply cannot stop watching and truly want to know what happens next, then you know you're on to something good.  HUMANS is that good.",1457481600,14,3871,4.784638554216867
7442568,5,B015JLUO5A,"So new a TV concept its hard to rate. Dont reject this until you view a couple episodesit turns to compulsion.

Adults spend more time communicating via Facebook, electronic device, or e-gaming than with their family members.

It is slickly produced and nicely acted but at the end of the day it is a well-worn idea repackaged with a futuristic twist - those who are in a minority or who are 'different' get marginalised or much worse. In this instance the plot is focused on the plight of the synths and how a group of synths with human intelligence fight for their people. It's really well done, but I found it often crosses the line into grubbiness when it builds episodes around sex between humans and synths or fight clubs created by humans to beat helpless synths until they are broken. Yes, I get it already. Humans are cruel and selfish and all sorts of other horrible things and it gets tiring having it shoved down your throat for 46 minutes at a time.

8733813,3,B015JLUO5A,"I have 5 major criticisms:

1.  What kept annoying me, every time it would occur (especially in season 1) was the misuse of the word conscious.  The major human characters would describe the servant synths as not being conscious while the synths, who were no longer under human control, they would describe as being conscious or having consciousness.

This is a complete misuse of these words.  The servant synths, although they did whatever the humans ordered them to do (within limits), are clearly conscious.  These servant synths understand human language.  They infer the meanings and intent of their human masters.  The servant synths are aware of their surroundings and remember past events, just like humans.  By all measures that would be applied to humans, these servant synths are clearly conscious.  The adjective that the human characters should have used, to distinguish servant synths from so-called conscious synths, is self-directed or autonomous or independent.  The only difference between servant synths and autonomous synths is that, in the case of servant synths, their goals are the goals of their human masters.  In contrast, the autonomous, self-directed synths can decide on their own what their (new) goals will be and these goals involve their own desires (which include self-preservation).  This difference is a very big one, but it is NOT a difference between being conscious versus being non-conscious.

In a TV show like this one, using such a incorrect word really implies that the script writers think that both the viewers and the human characters are not very bright.  As a professor in the area of AI, I find this mischaracterization, of how servant synths and autonomous synths differ, to be particularly jarring and annoying.

2.  My next pet peeve is that the episodes basically set up the autonomous synths (call them a-synths) to be viewed as a minority group that has been mistreated and deserves equality (just like prior human minorities, such as blacks in the USA).  However, we are never given any real information about the physical embodiment underlying synth minds and brains.  You might not think that this is important because, traditionally, when humans compare themselves against other animals, its our MINDS that make a big difference.  However, if you are going to compare yourself against a synthetic entity that has a similar type of mind (and perhaps even a superior one) then it is the form of EMBODIMENT of the synth that will make the biggest difference.  Synths are non-biological entities  they can eat but it is a sham since it goes into a plastic bag inside their bodies that is later dumped;  they appear not to sleep or dream;  they consume electricity, not food;  they are not alive biologically and so will never give birth; will never be children; will never grow into adults and will not die as humans do; they don't appear to ever get physically uncomfortable).

Imagine what the world, with just such non-biological entities, would be like:  Gone are all aspects of childhood (Disney films and theme parks; gone are all childrens toys and books; gone are elementary schools, birthday parties and parenting).  Gone are all restaurants, food courts, kitchens and bathrooms (since they don't digest or defecate); gone are old age, death and illnesses.  Thus, the nature of their physical embodiment really is very important for deciding how to treat them.  Unfortunately, any clear kind of information, regarding their form of embodiment, is denied to the viewers.  Much more troubling, the humans in the series (even high-level, well-educated humans) don't every ask themselves anything about such issues.

3.  It irritates me that synths appear to want to find love (either with humans or with each other) without any explanation for why synths have these goals.  The need for love, in humans, is the result of millions of years of evolution.  Humans that didn't form long-term pair bonds failed to perform as good a job in rearing their offspring.  If an urge to have sex had not evolved in our species, it would not have survived.  In contrast, synths have no sexually based form of procreation (they are created in factories).  There is no explanation as to why synths would be fabricated to want to love or be loved.  Even if some synths were used as sex objects by humans, there is no discussion of why they might want sex once they become autonomous.

There is no indication as to how difficult (or easy) it is to download (new) synth goals (or alter pre-existing synth goals).  A possible solution (for keeping synths both happy and as servants) would be to simply have autonomous synths experience pleasure  and/or a sense of fulfillment only when they are working to achieve the goals of their human creators.  Why would this form of autonomy be immoral?  They would feel autonomous but derive pleasure from wanting to serve humans.  Such a possibility is never really discussed by the human characters (although its the humans who created the synths in the first place and ostensibly some of them should know how synths are cognitively organized).

4. Having a synth be a child in the series is both intriguing and annoying.  Intriguing because it opens up interesting possibilities but annoying because they are never explored.  First, the child is not really childlike.  The child has a very adult mind in some aspects and a child-like mind only in that it lacks certain forms of background knowledge.  We have to assume that the child synth (unlike adult synths) was released into the world without knowing certain types of general knowledge (that adult synths were fabricated as already knowing).  However, the child synth is so unchild-like that it has to learn to simulate child-like behavior.  The humans all around it, however, treat it as though it really IS a child, when clearly it is something else, placed inside a child body.  Also, since it is non-biological, it will always remain trapped in that child body and at that exact age and height, no matter how much its brain develops into adulthood over time.

5.  It is clear that the the script writers wanted to reach the viewers ONLY through their emotions, leaving no pathways for any sort of critical thought or analysis.  For example,  the committee, tasked with determining whether or not autonomous synths deserve to be protected (from angry, frightened humans), never discusses any deep issues, such as:  (a) how do autonomous synths differ from humans?  Now that they are autonomous, how do they decide what their own future goals will be and to what extent might these goals be a threat to human existence?  Will such synths be allowed to go run factories and produce more synths like themselves?  How will an autonomous synth live among humans and find its own fulfillment when it doesnt eat, doesnt age, doesnt sleep, doesnt get uncomfortable, doesn't need to exercise, and so on. For example, what kinds of entertainment will autonomous synths want (if any)?  Do autonomous synths have similar goals to obtain different forms of higher social status (as humans do, in science, in business, in politics)?

Historically, when two distinct human cultures or countries have encountered each other, there have arisen wars and conquests of one civilization by the other.  What property rights should autonomous synths have?  What happens if synths decide to free all the servant synths that the humans have grown to rely on?

The show could have been much more intelligent but the script writers chose to stick to a shallow emotional level and, worse, the writers have set up the entire framework to get the human viewers to sympathize with the poor, down-trodden, synths (like they are some kind of human minority, seeking their inalienable rights).  This very shallow approach (to an initially  thought-provoking premise) is quite a disappointment.

The show is better than other Sci-Fi TV series but it could have been so much better.",1534377600,,7991,5.011380880121396
