8077873,5,B000AD4JCM,"Fantastic!  Another great Sinatra concert from start to finish.  Also, his performance of New York, New York that night is one of the best ever captured of him on film.  Sinatra really goes for it and holds out the last note forever.  Bravo!",1428364800,,241,4.534883720930233
8077874,4,B000AD4JCM,"While not having the best sound the performance was excellent. Sinatra didn't miss a note. It must be difficult to chat with an audience that, for the most part, doesn't understand you except for the lyrics of the song you're singing. The few attempts to connect verbally missed the mark. So, he just sang superbly and all was well.",1427587200,2,332,4.6440677966101696

8077877,5,B000AD4JCM,"I bought this with three other concerts and this concert, Sinatra in Japan, 1985 is the BEST LIVE concert I have ever heard. His voice was flawless! The video is also good. Frank Sinatra does a completely serious show showing respect to the Japanese audience. It has some of his favorite musicians with him in the Japanese orchestra. He is feeling his best and it shows in his style voice and total performance. He hits the high notes and holds them with perfection. It is said that in Sinatra reading material that Frank was never happy with his studio recordings of Mack the Knife, well he totally nails it in this concert. You can see the breath and even spittle from the angle of the camera work. The man did no wrong on that night. If you want to see the man at his best, look no further. a total of 17 songs I read a review by Anthoney Nash who said this video is not available in the United States, well I bought my DVD at Fries in Burbank, Ca. in a four DVD collection from Shout entertainment and worth it in the four set just to have this one DVD in Japan.

8077878,5,B000AD4JCM,"Now, I do not actually own this dvd, but I have seen pretty much the entire show via Youtube (and swiftly saved them to my desktop before they were snatched off by the Sinatra estate), and this is undoubtedly Frank at his finest.

This show was recorded at the Budokan Hall in 1985. Of course, by now, Frank is of course not at his absolute peak, but to be 69 and still going as good as he is here is not something to complain about. His voice isn't able to quite hit the high notes, but he still can sell a song better than anyone, and his interpretive skills still lack flaws.

The setlist is a standard collection of Sinatra classics, including ""The Lady Is A Tramp"", ""My Way"", ""My Kind Of Town"", ""Luck Be A Lady"", and ""Strangers In The Night"", all performed with flair and passion. The Japanese orchestra supporting him are a thrill to watch as well (listen to how hard they swing ""All Or Nothing At All"").

Overall, this is a most excellent latter day show from Ol' Blue Eyes. It is sadly not available here in the States, but should definitely be sought out if you are a true Frank fan.",1191628800,,1092,4.29126213592233
