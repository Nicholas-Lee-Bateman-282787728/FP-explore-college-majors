It is a TOTAL body routine that I will be able to use for years...Farhan does a great job offering begginer to advanced versions through the entire work out.  The work out is so centered and it finishes up with some great variations on yoga poses with the ball!  Very nice touch!  I even use some of these moves while I'm at the gym now.  I love this DVD.

Cheers To Your Health!",1232064000,,430,4.120481927710843
8366345,5,B001CB96SI,"Farhan Dhalla is a extraordinary trainer.  In this DVD he leads you through a challenging workout for core (abdominal) fitness and strength training using the body ball and weights.  He is skilled at bringing out the best in you and providing a thorough and complete workout.  He expertly weaves together inspiring music with the routine and Farhan's gentle nature shines throughout! I highly recommend this DVD. After every workout I feel stronger, calmer and ready to take on my day. It's number one in my collection of workout routines.",1229644800,2,539,5.033707865168539
