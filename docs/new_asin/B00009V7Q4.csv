1890614,5,B00009V7Q4,"Great~~~
I don't care how I dance with this, but the most important thing is that I am trying to follow them.
While I am following them for dancing, I fell really happy.",1447286400,,169,4.151515151515151
1890615,2,B00009V7Q4,Gave away.,1447027200,,10,4.5
1890616,5,B00009V7Q4,"I gave 5 stars not because it is perfect, but because I really do love this workout more than any other video that I have purchased. The music is not some fake cheesy ""latin"" like you find in some other videos, and sounds like authentic dance club music. Giselle has a great up-beat Latin personality that keeps you motivated. You feel like you are really dancing, not just trying to keep up with a whole lot of weird fast moves like Crunch's Jennifer Gilardi does. The live drumming which matches the beat to the movements, really helps to keep it enjoyable. It does take a few times for your calf muscles to get used to all the cha-chas, which there are a lot of! The samba portion is rather difficult, at points I go half time - working my way up to full speed...

I've tried a lot of dance workout videos and I will say that Crunch generally puts out the most professionally produced package. This production didn't quite live up to the level I expected, with several mistakes by the dancers which can be pretty distracting and cause you to make your own mistakes especially while still learning, and some missed or mis-cues by Giselle. At one point she forgets to specify changing from the right to the left leg leading in a walk up-and-back combo, and at another point she tells you to go left when you are going right. There's one spot where it seems like she forgot her words and they came out ""wooo aaah."" It's sad that the producers didn't take the time to make this video perfect like they could have with just a couple of extra takes.

I would love to see more workouts with Giselle but I think now she is involved in the Zumba movement, and I can't afford the Zumba DVDs right now.",1439251200,,1694,4.39171974522293
1890617,5,B00009V7Q4,Wife loves it. I like watching her practice also.,1438732800,,49,4.555555555555555
1890618,4,B00009V7Q4,"I ordered 3 video on the same day. Although this was my favorite of the 3, my video arrived opened and not secured at all! It was moving around and when I inspected it, it appeared scratched. It plays fine so far. The video looks like a lot of fun! I'll need to practice the moves a few times but I'll definitely add this video to my weekly routines!",1426896000,,350,4.086956521739131
1890619,2,B00009V7Q4,"I'm really not a fan of Giselle's technique or style. This is definitely a DVD that is for an intermediate to professional level of salsa dance. But for a beginner to learn latin dance, it's just not for beginners. The video plays out like this crazy hyped-up speed-induced NYC gym feeling with an overly enthusiastic instructor who doesn't teach the technique, steps, or the lesson. She just launches into full-on dance cardio madness. I really hate this DVD. I prefer the salsa video from ""Dance off the inches"" sizzling salsa as the instructor actually breaks down the dance movements and steps first before launching into routine.",1422316800,,634,4.990566037735849
1890620,5,B00009V7Q4,So much fun!  The time flies by.,1421712000,,32,3.5714285714285716

1890623,4,B00009V7Q4,Very good workout....,1416700800,,21,6.333333333333333
1890624,2,B00009V7Q4,The moves are too complicated for me to pick up quickly enough for it to be fun.  Maybe if you are a natural when it comes to dance you'll enjoy it.,1416441600,,148,3.774193548387097
1890625,4,B00009V7Q4,This is a very fun routine.  It would be better if it was more intense.,1413676800,,71,3.7333333333333334
1890626,5,B00009V7Q4,Very satisfied with this purchase.,1413331200,,34,6.0
1890627,5,B00009V7Q4,"The people in this DVD are some what silly specially the supposed drummer that keeps the beat. But it made me work out! I have lost about 7lb and 3"" on my waist so it works! If you are into salsa fun and can't go get a class or feel like me a bit shy to dance in public this is truly the way to go!",1409097600,,298,3.5303030303030303

1890629,4,B00009V7Q4,I enjoyed this workout. It added flavor to my normal routine. I would recommend trying it or mixing it in with your typical exercise regimen for variety,1403913600,,152,4.666666666666667
1890630,5,B00009V7Q4,I enjoy this video .. exactly as I expected and a decent price.  Would recomment it if you're looking for a good exercice video.,1394236800,,128,4.333333333333333
1890631,5,B00009V7Q4,"It is more than what I expected.  The price is the best and since I used a gift certificate, it was prefect.",1392681600,,108,3.909090909090909
1890632,5,B00009V7Q4,A lot of fun : ) easy to follow choreography which caused me  to work up a sweat. Very upbeat instructor!,1392422400,,105,4.0
1890633,5,B00009V7Q4,"First, let me state that I have 2 left feet and absolutly no sense of rithym.  But I have a large number of fitness DVDs that I use to aviod getting bored.

I tried this one, and well it was fun.  I would grade it as a light/intermediate arobic workout.  It got my heart rate up and I broke into a sweat but nothing extreme.  I was able to add a bit more bounce to increase the intensity.

It was relatively easy to follow along and get into the dance moves.  The instructer had good cueing which helped a ton.

Any excercies dvd that will keep me interested and coming back is a winner for me.  And I am looking forward to doing this one again!",1389657600,,645,4.055555555555555
1890634,5,B00009V7Q4,"Love it, great variety.  There is no mat work, which is fine, but this is a great, active workout and you will definitely feel it.  Very easy to follow, I was not intimated.  If you are tired of the more popular name brand exercise DVDs, I highly recommend this.",1386288000,,262,4.3061224489795915
1890635,4,B00009V7Q4,Very nice salsa lessons and cardio workout.  It is very funny and I am using the video all the weeks.,1386028800,,101,4.05
1890636,5,B00009V7Q4,This DVD makes me forget i can't dance and I can just have fun. Giselle does a great job building up the sequence and the music is a great backdrop. I have a hard time doing high impact due to my knees but  find I can this routine quite well. It is lower impact so if you are at a higher level it may not do as much for you but it is a fun way to work out.,1374537600,,356,3.5063291139240507
1890637,4,B00009V7Q4,This DVD is nice.  I liked the music and the moves.  It offered a good variety of styles and moves.,1368403200,,99,3.9
1890638,5,B00009V7Q4,"Loving the salsa tape, it is fun and it is helping me to loose weight along with some salsa moves",1367107200,,97,3.9
1890639,5,B00009V7Q4,"I had the vhs to this and used it everyday. lost some weight. lol. but then vhs went out and dvds came in. so I ordered a copy of this. the music is fun, there is the zumba combo I cant seem to get down, but this def gets the heartrate up.",1366070400,,239,3.6153846153846154
1890640,5,B00009V7Q4,This was a gift for my adult daughter who is getting her body back in shape.  She likes the variety of dances (she loves dancing).,1364947200,,130,4.2
1890641,5,B00009V7Q4,This is the best video workout ever! I enjoy every time I exercise. I love Giselle she keeps me pumped. Fresh beats with sexy Latin Flair! It is Muy Caliente! Love it!,1362268800,,167,4.25
1890642,4,B00009V7Q4,"This is a high-energy workout that was easy to follow and not to hard on your body while still burning lots of calories and breaking a nice sweat.  (I have been nursing a foot injury for the past 7 months and kept up just fine--I just left out any hops/jumps.)  It was a nice balance of aerobics and dance, leaning towards aerobics.  I thought the instructor did a good job of starting with basic foot patterns and then adding hips, arms, more steps and cha-chas, etc.  If you don't have a dance background or haven't gone to many aerobics classes, you might get lost in a few places, but just remember that as long as you're moving, you're burning calories!  If you want a break from your normal aerobic routine, give this DVD a try.  I would even consider buying this one.

P.S. As a fun side note, this video also features the same stoned drummer in the background that I am pretty sure was also in the ""Yoga Booty Ballet"" video I recently rented.",1359936000,,950,4.394285714285714
1890643,4,B00009V7Q4,"I would recommend this video for people who are new to doing dance workouts and/or are not in tip top cardiovascular shape.  The instructor does an excellent job of breaking down many simple steps into teachable chunks, and for keeping the pace moving briskly.  However, if you are used to running or any other rigorous exercise, these dance routines will not allow you to even break a sweat. The production values are good, and you get a choice of several routines which you can do separately or combine as one.

I would not recommend this video for anyone who is seriously interested in learning the moves of Latin style dance.  The instructor doesn't teach the mechanics that lead to maximum hip movement.  For authentic hip swings back and forth and side to side, you need to have your knees bent, and you also have to understand the articulation between the muscles of the upper abdomen and those of the lower abdomen.  None of this is explained.  The ""salsa"" step shown is not a traditional salsa step, since there is no instruction for the ""Cuban Hip"" motion which is necessary to salsa.  The samba step is not a recognizable Afro-Brazilian step, but seems to be a watered-down North American version.

For those interested in learning how to move the body Latin style, I recommend Wyoma's video African Healing Dance (Latin dance is heavily influenced by African dance styles).  Also, Quenia Ribeiro's ""Dance Today! Samba"" or her ""Samba Reggae Workout.""  Yesenia Adame also has a good video called ""Salsa. . .Solo!"".  If you just want to move quickly around the dance floor with some semi-Latin footwork, this video is fine.",1359590400,2,1632,4.830935251798561
1890644,2,B00009V7Q4,the quality of the DVD is great the actual instruction for this cardio salsa is not very exciting. too repetitive and it doesn't really gets your heart rate up. . .  disappointing content. But the vendor was great!,1359504000,,214,4.631578947368421
1890645,4,B00009V7Q4,"I have several Crunch videos, and wanted to try Zumba but didn't want to spend much just to try it out. This video was reasonable and turned out to be a decent workout with ""mirrored"" movements and clear explanations of how to move. It is not exactly Zumba, but Zumba-esque.",1358640000,,274,4.5
1890646,2,B00009V7Q4,"This workout has potential to be a nice break from the monotony of standard cardio aerobic workouts---if you are keen on programs requring speedy feet and minimal movement/step breakdown. Don't expect this to mimic the salsa dancing you might do with another person at a club but if you take the time to breakdown Giselle's lightening fast moves I am sure they transfer to actual dance.

This DVD is split into sections: Salsa, Merengue, Samba and Salsa-Merengue combinations. If done back to back this completes an appoximately 35 minute workout. With time I began to enjoy this program but like many reviewers found the learning curve very steep.

I no longer use this program much but for those into the Salsa/Latin dance genre it does have potential.",1357084800,,754,4.929133858267717
1890647,5,B00009V7Q4,"This video is so fun! It's not the hardest workout I've ever had but it's great for sustained cardio. Every time I do I find myself sweating and having fun, and sometimes I do it twice in a row because I'm not ready to stop dancing. Giselle is a great teacher and the group dancing with her look like normal people so you aren't intimidated. I recommend this for beginners, intermediates, or anyone who just wants a good, reliable, fun cardio workout.",1355443200,,451,4.512195121951219
1890648,4,B00009V7Q4,"I had previous experience with Giselle (the instructor) in a video she did with Daisy Fuentes.  It was fun and she's very passionate.  This was a pretty easy to follow workout but really works you and gets your heart rate up in a fun way.  I love most of the Crunch series workouts-the dancers are good, they look good, the setting is stylish, there's even a live bongo drummer in the background who brings the cool factor even more.  I want to work out with the beautiful people in a hot place!  (That's why I don't go to the gym and I workout at home! Haha) But all in all, this is a really fun workout that I return to again and again.",1351468800,,638,4.154471544715447
1890649,5,B00009V7Q4,Everything I expected and more! Its so much fun you won't recognize that you are really working out. I have already lost 6 lbs  in 3 wks. Plus my tummy is visibly flatter.,1348358400,,171,4.181818181818182
1890650,5,B00009V7Q4,"This workout is fun and I really like the energy and personality of the instructor, Gisele. It is a pretty light, low impact routine, so maybe not great for extreme athletes, but if you are just looking for a routine to get you moving and maybe start at a beginning or intermediate level, this one is very motivating. It has helped me a lot with my fibromyalgia muscle tightness and pain, as well.",1346889600,,397,4.4520547945205475
1890651,5,B00009V7Q4,"I used to be scared to death to leave my home because Mr. Scampers my pug Chihuahua mix had extreme separation anxiety. He would destroy my house! I originally bought this video because I love Salsa, especially pico de gallo. needless to say I was a little disappointed at first. I was about to turn it off seconds into the first watch when I noticed Mr. Scampers was mesmerized. He seemed really focused on the dark-haired back up dancer in the pink top. He got so worked up he went to town on his ""special"" pillow I keep for him on the floor. He was so vigorously loving his pillow I was worried for his little heart. But he was ok and after that the little guy napped the rest of the afternoon.
So now whenever I leave the house I put the dvd on and have the peace of mind my house will be ok and Mr. Scampers will be happy. He's actually lost a little weight too which is a good thing since the vet said he was morbidly obese. The only down side is I have to wash the pillow a lot and it's a little worse for the wear.",1335312000,,1022,4.039408866995074
1890652,5,B00009V7Q4,"This is a great and fun workout.  On a sidenote, the girl in the hot pink top and dark hair that appears in the video and in the preview video dancing behind Giselle, is not to be trusted, as she is a theif of hearts.  She stole mine, and then lost it and replaced it with a prosthetic one she ordered from Ossur. Still she's mesmerizing.",1335312000,,338,4.106060606060606
1890653,4,B00009V7Q4,"This workout is about 40 minutes.  Not too long and not too short.  Giselle is easy to follow and after you get used to the routine, you can ramp it up and it does a nice job of giving you a decent workout.",1332115200,,206,3.7674418604651163
1890654,3,B00009V7Q4,This definitely keeps you thinking.  If you want a moderate workout then this is for you.  However the ques from Giselle were not that good.  I had a hard time following and I used to be a top rated fitness instructor in my area...so i was a bit disappointed.,1313107200,,259,4.244897959183674
1890655,3,B00009V7Q4,"This routine was okay, but it is more like aerobics than true dance (e.g. has knee lifts and lunges).  I could follow the cueing okay except for changing feet.  I always ended up on the wrong foot and confused.  I like Dance off the Inches: Dance It off Ballroom a lot better because the focus there is on learning dance moves there and I feel beautiful and stylish.  This one felt like exercising rather than dancing.  This workout is too intense for a beginner like me to get through it and I don't feel motivated to keep at it to build up my endurance.",1293235200,,555,4.298076923076923
1890656,3,B00009V7Q4,"The pros: the drums are fun, Giselle is energetic, and the workout is varied and not boring.

The cons:
Like others have said, Giselle doesn't explain the moves in enough detail. At first she does, then she starts linking them together without tips or explanation, and eventually (e.g., the pony step) she just doesn't even tell you what to do. I tried to imitate some of the moves but constantly thought I was doing them wrong, which frustrated me and I eventually just give up - EVERY SINGLE TIME I DO THE WORKOUT. I've tried it about six to eight times, and it hasn't gotten any easier from a choreography standpoint.

Then the workout isn't difficult at all! I have exercise-induced asthma, so usually I'm panting and red-faced at the slightest amount of impact, but even when I got the moves down pat, I wasn't sweating too much.

On a couple more superficial notes, there is a girl who looks like Fairuza Balk behind Giselle who is...reeeallly into it, and her sassy moves are really distracting. The rest of the backup dancers are just as cheesy-looking, too. It's kind of off-putting.

So I can't recommend it to a beginner because of the moves, but I can't recommend it to an intermediate because the workout just isn't that intense. Bummer.",1288656000,,1250,4.69406392694064
1890657,4,B00009V7Q4,"When I watched the short clip, her accent irritated me somewhat but I got the dvd anyway. After receiving the product & going through the workout a couple of times, I find her much more agreeable than even Jennifer Galardi, i.e. in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Fat-Burning-Dance-Party/dp/B00020HDFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch - Fat Burning Dance Party</a>&nbsp;.
She's more natural, yet personal. Would look out for more of fitness/dance dvds.
In terms of the workout, it's pretty fun & the moves are not hard to follow.
Not the best latin dance instructional vid, nor is it the best fitness workout, but it strikes a fair enough balance to be worth trying out!",1288396800,,721,5.876190476190477
1890658,3,B00009V7Q4,I purchased the video for my Mom because she wanted a Latin workout video.  The music is great and it did make me sweat a little.  It was fun however if you want a serious workout I would not advise getting this video.,1282953600,,218,4.046511627906977
1890659,3,B00009V7Q4,"I enjoyed this video.  First let me start that I don't have a dance background.  However, I had very few problems with following the steps.  They're really not very difficult.  You get in what you put in, so if you're more of an advanced person, you'll have to work a little harder to work up a sweat. The workout is fun and since it's broken into segments, it's not as boring as some workouts can be.  Also, if you have difficulty with one segment, you may have a better chance of catching on to one of the subsequent segments/  My main complaint about the video is that I wish it were longer.  I actually play it twice when I want a decent workout.",1278460800,2,650,4.235772357723577
1890660,5,B00009V7Q4,"Love this video.  It's one of my fav's.  The moves aren't that difficult to follow and I honestly never get tired of it.  It's not as intense as some of the others such as tae bo, but it is effective.  The more you get into it, the more results you will see.",1274313600,,258,3.9038461538461537
1890661,4,B00009V7Q4,"I've owned this as a video and looked for it as a DVD when we finally chucked the VCR.  Although I don't feel like I'm at a club, there are lots of latin moves, the music is fast and upbeat, the pace is quick, and the routines are fun.  I definately worked up a sweat.  I am not a dancer and picked up the moves just fine. It really helped my endurance level go up, and I looked forward to exercise again.",1270166400,,405,3.9146341463414633
1890662,2,B00009V7Q4,"I was very excited when I first got this in the mail but as I went through it, I got more and more disappointed. It was very hard to follow the instructor. Unless you are already familiar with the salsa dancing, you will get lost!! If you can keep up, it will give you an intense workout, but good luck. I do not recommend this DVD to the average person trying to lose weight!!",1262217600,2,377,4.108108108108108
1890663,4,B00009V7Q4,"When I bought this, I expected Latin dance such as ""Crunch: Latin Rhythms"", but instead I got aerobics with a lot of Latin flair added to it.  I really like this VHS/DVD, but I still had to take a point off for not telling exactly what it is.  It is divided into 5 dance segments with a warm-up and cool down.  This is what I thought of them:

Warm-Up-Giselle Roque de Escobar is the instructor and she does a great job of teaching you a few steps you will see later in the combos.  She also stretches your back before declaring you ready to do the workout.

Salsa-This routine has a few familiar steps, and the only thing ""Latin"" about them are the hips that Giselle adds.  The arms are really fun, but there really isn't anything ""Latin"" about them.

Merengue-You do a merengue step even when your marching as Giselle shows you how to march with your knees coming in and you hips moving to make it look good.  This is a real dancing routine, I think, with some fun moves from the Merengue dance.

Salsa Merengue Combo-In here, you do ""Salsa"" (which like I said is just aerobic moves with hips) and Merengue (which is actually dance) moves together into a combo.  Not totally dance but more than the Salsa section.

Samba-Not you're traditional Samba, this routine has you do a really fast skipping movement constantly, and it is great work for your calves.  You don't see any bouncing and you don't shimmy, but it is great fun and a great workout for your legs.

Latin Fun-A mixture of various Latin dance moves, this routine is aerobics mixed with dance moves.  It is a fun mixture.

Cool Down-Some flamenco moves are used in this section as well as some really good stretching and Tai Chi.  A nice cool down that stretches you out.

Overall it is really fun, and if you can get it at a good price, buy it!  But don't expect it to be as dancey as the ""Fat Burning Dance Party"" and don't expect it to be as Latin as the ""Latin Rhythms.""  But still, it is a good workout.",1260748800,3,1972,4.35068493150685
1890664,3,B00009V7Q4,"I am probably just giving up to early. Just got it and just tried it. But I felt like an idiot because she doesn't take any time to show the steps. So it's probably best to know these steps beforehand or give it several goes. It looked a bit more doable when I just watched it. But then again, I don't pick up steps very easily. Perhaps I'll just stick to Leslie and her walking DVD's. That's more for me and my two left feet. Perhaps I'll try this DVD when I feel more ready to give it a try.",1252195200,,493,3.94
1890665,2,B00009V7Q4,I was disappointed. Not the best or most fun exercise video. The moves are rather boring. The music isn't the best either.,1250899200,,122,4.590909090909091
1890666,4,B00009V7Q4,"Based on the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure that I wanted to get this DVD. I ordered it on the last day of a great Amazon sale. And, I am happy I did. My goal is to do something active everyday. This is a nice change of pace. It made me work but it wasn't too tough - even for a lightweight exerciser like me! I must admit, my first time through was early in the morning so it took me while to get into the groove and catch onto the steps. But, Giselle is great with her cues so she was easy to follow. I have most of the Crunch DVD's and I like the format and sequences the trainers use. They are vey good and consistent with how they add-on and cycle through each section. As for Cardio Salsa, I will definitely include this in my rotation for those days when I want a light to moderate cardio workout.",1249603200,,802,3.987577639751553

I'm a fan of the instructor (Giselle Roque de Escobar) from the old NAC workouts...unfortunately, her personality did not shine in this workout.  The pace of the music is Very fast, and there didn't seem to be any time for Giselle to get personable.

Also, while Giselle's cueing was just fine, there seemed to be a lot of breakdown (16 counts on the left, on the right...then 8 counts on the left, on the right etc.) and I got a little bored because I knew that the breakdown would go on for a while!

Lots of knee bounces and twisting movements make this an almost impossible workout to do on carpet.  There's also some double grapevine moves, so you need more lateral space than usual.

The dance combinations were fairly easy in the beginning when she takes you through the seperate steps and got pretty intricate when you put them all together.  I have NO rhythm, but was able to follow along with most of it. I imagine after  three or four viewing, I will be able to follow along better and that should increase my calorie burn and help get my heart rate a little higher.

1890702,3,B00009V7Q4,"If cardio bores you easily, this workout is fun.  I disagree with some of the other reviewers that it's unrelated to ""real"" salsa.  I've had a few years of Latin dance instruction, and while the moves in this video are certainly simplified and ""dumbed down"" a bit, they do reflect the motions and rhythms of the actual dances.

The workout has several segments related to various Latin dances.  Each segment goes through a single combination that the instructor breaks out move by move.  She takes you through one half of the combination, puts those moves together, then goes through the moves of the other half of the combination.  Then you dance through both halves of the combination twice.  Anyone who has ever been to an aerobics class of any kind, and especially anyone who has ever studied any kind of dance, should be used to this format and should be able to pick up the moves.  Beginners with no dance or aerobics class experience may need more practice, but if you're willing to consistently do this workout several times, there is no reason not to pick it up.

The problem with this workout is its length and intensity.  It gets you to a moderate, but not really heart-pumping, sweat-dripping, intensity (the way something like Turbo Jam would).  The most intense part of the workout lasts only around 23 minutes (without warmup and cooldown).  If I'm going to work out at that low a level of intensity, I'd like it to go on at least 10 minutes longer.  Another option would be to make those 23 minutes more intense.

Instructor is encouraging and upbeat without being annoying.  The other people in the class are of differing body types, which is refreshing to see in an exercise video.

I generally use this video as a quick burst of cardio for when I'm tired or sick, or if I need an extra cardio boost on a day when I'm planning to be active, but not planning to work out really hard.

In short, the biggest problem with this video is that the choreography might be considered too complex or intimidating for beginners, but not intense or long enough for advanced exercisers.  That being said, a beginner who is willing to persevere and stick with it long enough to get comfortable with the moves would enjoy this workout.",1172707200,7,2238,4.637055837563452

1890738,5,B00009V7Q4,"I'm writing this review for beginners, because that's where I'm coming from.  People who dance salsa or have 800 fitness videos might not relate :) So...

This DVD is awesome. I love it. I've done it every day since I got it!

I have been doing Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds workouts for the past month (?) or so, mostly doing the 3-mile walk, and recently jogging instead of walking in place.  I'm not in great shape, but I've been gaining cardiovascular strength, so I think that has helped me follow this DVD without being winded.  I think most people with a moderate level of stamina could make it through this DVD without falling over.  Even if you do fall over, you will want to get back up because the workout is so much fun!

I am not a super-coordinated person, and there are a lot of workout styles that I won't touch because they involve nutty footwork or require you to have each of your limbs doing something different.  But after two or three times through this DVD, I can do almost all of the moves! Yay!  You have to pay attention to figure out some of the things she's doing (the square step comes to mind), but you'll get it.  Just keep at it!  The first time I tried the workout, I did what I could do, and just danced around when I couldn't keep up. That also was fun. But eventually, it clicked, and now my smugness level is through the roof.

Giselle Roque de Escobar is a great instructor and a real dynamo--she never stops moving.  She's adorable, and watching her elegant versions of the moves you're clumsily imitating is really inspiring.  Her voice and accent are also enjoyable.  A+!

This is the most fun I've had doing a workout DVD.  I'd do it even if I weren't trying to get in better shape!",1142035200,20,1732,4.379310344827586
1890739,4,B00009V7Q4,"I've become a video workout girl - going to the gym never sticks, but jumping around in my basement works great - so I'm slowly amassing quite a collection. This DVD is a great addition to my collection. I'm in poor aerobic shape (but decent ""strength"" shape), so for me, this workout is a real challenge. It definitely gets me sweating and raises my heart rate. It took me several sessions before I could make it through the entire video - at first I had to skip the last two segments, then the last one, then I could finally do it all. However, it's really FUN, so I'm not minding that I'm sweating like a pig. The instructor, to me, is fun, accessible, and motivating, and the backup dancers all look like they're having a good time as well. I find myself grinning while dancing.

Three caveats about this video: First, if you have bad knees, some of the moves are hard on your knees. (Also not the first video to pick up after spraining an ankle!) Second, some of the combinations are complicated if you have no dance training or if you are a kinesthetic klutz like me. I did manage to learn them, but it took me a few tries. Some people who prefer very simple moves will be put off by this. And third, there are no real stops or breaks to get a drink of water - or grab your inhaler if you're asthmatic. I pause between segments to catch my breath and grab the inhaler when necessary. For some this will be a bonus - the rare video with no stops or breaks in the action. For others, this will necessitate use of the pause button.

While this video will not be to everyone's work-out taste, I love it, and I definitely reccommend it, particularly for those who enjoy dance-based aerobics.",1141344000,10,1692,4.35126582278481

1890741,3,B00009V7Q4,I picked this DVD because I liked Giselle from the Zumba video.  I was a disappointed because the workout was really easy for me. I'd recommend this video for someone who is new to working out.,1140998400,3,193,4.361111111111111

1890744,5,B00009V7Q4,"I think this is a really fun video.  I've always enjoyed Giselle as an instructor  and wish she would come out with more videos.  This takes you through five different combinations of Latin moves done to a Latin music soundtrack and a live drummer.  It may take you until the second or third time to really get the moves comfortably and give them some ""flava"" but you will have a blast in the process.  I also like that Giselle is a great dancer to watch and be inspired by.  Once she starts getting into the moves you can copy the nuances to give your steps a more authentic latin look.  This workout is about 35 minutes long.",1138752000,4,627,4.3076923076923075

The music is good and the instructor is energetic, however I found it's rather difficult for someone who is unfamiliar with latin moves or someone who does not do advanced aerobics.  After about 2 months I can only do some of the moves, despite watching the video in slow motion and rewinding a lot (to figure out how she does the dance steps).  I would recommend this DVD only for those who are experienced in dance or have had extensive experience with aerobics.",1138147200,7,548,4.571428571428571

She gives wonderful, helpful, and easy cues to keep you on target, in line and on step. Some of the steps you just have to be patient and practice. But, you will get them in a matter of watching it only a couple of times. I would, for the first time, just sit down and watch the video, and maybe try to do some of the more difficult moves, then go full speed ahead to a full-filled, strong workout.

I love it and if you love to get down, groovy, and feel saucy (even though you are the only one watching...which could be a good thing, like in my case), then this movie is for you!

1890760,4,B00009V7Q4,"Crunch Cardio Salsa is a lively mix of Latin dance styles reworked as cardio exercise moves. The instructor for this workout is Giselle Roque de Escobar. This workout is broken into 7 segments:

1. Warm-up

2. Salsa Combination

3. Merengue Combination

4. Merengue Salsa Combination

5. Samba Combination

6. Latin Funk Combination

7. Cool Down

In general: This is a fun and active workout--I definitely worked up a sweat and, at one point, my legs felt like rubber. Both the instructor and the backup dancers are VERY good at this and most really get into it, so you get a great flavor for Latin dancing in general as well as the workout. Can't say that I would recommend this workout to guys because there are a lot of very feminine hand and hip gestures throughout the workout.

A few details: I found the Samba portion (#5) the most challenging by far. Until that point, I didn't have a problem learning the steps or keeping up with the pace, but the Samba beat me into submission. Whew!!! I think the music/pace is at its fastest during this portion, so that didn't help. I think that this whole workout would have been easier if done on an uncarpeted surface. That is true of most cardio workouts but triply so for this one. Because of the fast footwork and because you need to stay on your toes for much of it, carpet is especially fatiguing (my calves were screaming by the time I got through Samba). The cooldown is longer than most cardio cooldowns and I kind of liked that. I especially liked the flamenco flavor added in the cooldown.

In summary: If you like to dance and have a good sense of rhythm, I'd suggest you try this. I had fun with it (except for Samba, which I could not follow on the first try) and with all the arm movements going along with the dance steps, you really do feel like you're dancing as much as working out--I liked that. Right now, after having done the workout once, I'm leaning toward buying it, but I will do the workout another two times or so on rental before I make my final decision.",1134950400,44,2034,4.45822102425876
1890761,3,B00009V7Q4,"I've been getting into more dancey videos lately, and I have several other Latin-themed ones that I enjoy, such as Kathy Smith's Latin Rhythm Workout. Unfortunately, I found Crunch Cardio Salsa to be mostly disappointing.  The chapter menu breaks down the workout into nine total segments (times are approximate): 1) introduction (1.5 minutes), 2) warm-up (6 minutes), 3) salsa combination (6 minutes), 4) meregue combination (5 minutes), 5) merengue salsa combination (5 minutes), 6) salsa combination (5 minutes), 7) latin funk combination (5 minutes), 8) cool down (4.5 minutes), and 9) credits.

The warm-up, which I thought was too long, didn't get my heart rate up at all; the moves were very slow, although easy to follow. The first dance segment was better, and I started to get into the workout a little more. The merengue moves kept my heart rate up, yet there was a lot more jumping/hopping, and the moves became a bit harder to follow. The second merengue section was better, but then again followed by a more complex segment, and by the ""funk"" section, I wasn't feeling very funky. Even the cool-down seemed kind of slow and boring to me, although it was shorter than the warm-up. But the thing that disappointed me the most about this workout is that after I was finished, my HR monitor showed that I was in my zone for less than HALF the cardio section!

Instructor Giselle Roque de Escobar was enthusiastic and seemed to be having fun. Initially, she taught each move in a way that was easy to learn, but when she began stringing the moves together in combinations and taking it from the top, she was much harder to follow. Also, she often had you move sideways to the right, come back to the middle, and then move sideways to the left, which took up quite a bit of space--more than I have in my workout room, anyway.  So, for a workout that clocked in at 38 1/2 minutes total, I really didn't feel like it was time well spent, and I probably won't be keeping this one.",1130544000,15,1985,4.646723646723647
1890762,4,B00009V7Q4,"I liked this workout, but would recommend that you have a HARD surface to dance on.  This workout is really difficult on carpet even if you have on shoes.  The dance moves are VERY fast, but fun.",1129507200,5,195,4.243243243243243
1890763,5,B00009V7Q4,"I've had this DVD for a few months, and it's definitely one of my favorite workouts.

One of the things I like best about it is that the instructor Giselle cues really well and also clearly breaks things down for each combination.  She gives you plenty of advance notice, and her cueing is always perfect.

When she first introduces a new move, the camera also focuses on just her legs so that you can see exactly what the move entails and how to do it.  After Giselle introduces the basic move, she builds on it, adding various combinations and arm movements so that you feel like you're getting a total body workout.

When I first purchased this DVD, I was also worried that it wouldn't provide a good aerobic workout, but it really does!  I'm an intermediate-level exerciser, and I've found that each time I do this workout, I get a great cardio workout that really gets my heartrate up.

It's a fun workout with great music and an upbeat instructor; she makes the routine so much fun that it's enjoyable to work out!",1129248000,3,1020,4.510869565217392

1890765,1,B00009V7Q4,"This video is obviously done by a well trained cardio person however there is nothing Salsa or even Latin about it! If you want to get your cardio up with Salsa then please do a Salsa class. This is a gimmick video made by a company that does a lot of different styles of cardio but at the end of the day they are just that...CARDIO.

Why do Cha Cha Cha, Samba, a little Salsa step mixed with all kinds of other stuff and call it Salsa? Not to mention the steps they show you are nothing autentic and nothing you really want to take with you style wise.

A lot of people who review this product say it is a cardio video and leave the Latin side of it alone. Well when you put Salsa Cardio on a video then I expect to do Salsa at a level where my heart rate is up to a cardio level. There is nothing Salsa about this one sorry. I wasn't looking for a Salsa instructional video but I was expecting to do some Salsa cardio and was extremely disappointed. Punters beware!

I had to waste my money on this video becasue I intend to be part of the solution and maybe one day put out a proper video that will not be oversold and under delivered.",1125446400,11,1138,4.0488888888888885

1890776,4,B00009V7Q4,"I really like this workout. I do aerobic exercise tapes five days a week, and Latin dance-inspired are my favorites. I also have Kathy Smith Latin Rhythm Workout, Reebok Aerobicaliente, Latin Grooves, etc., etc.! This tape ranks among my favorites. Giselle is fun and perky, and her instructions are easy to follow.

Other reviewers have complained that they did not learn any actual Latin dances. However, this aerobic workout is presented as just that...an aerobic workout. It does not pretend to be an instructional dance video. If you're trying to learn to dance, either buy an instructional video or take lessons at Arthur Murray!

The moves are fun and exciting. Some reviewers have complained that they are tough to learn, but I got it after a few times. Besides, if an exercise video has moves simple enough to be learned in one or two tries, they are also simple enough to get very boring, very fast. I also found the camera work to be perfectly fine.

As far as the energy level, I worked up a good sweat. I'm not a world-class athlete, by any means, but, as I mentioned, I exercise quite a bit, so I'm not a novice either. This workout was challenging enough to get my heart pumping! The music is great, with a live drummer, so you will be inspired by the beat.

My only complaint is the half-naked back-up exercisers. They are clearly healthy, but NOT in great shape. They all have on skimpy, midriff-baring tops and low-rise pants, which are fine, if the wearers are sporting ""six pack"" abs. These women, however, distract me a bit with their flabby, jiggling stomachs. I would have preferred more clothing.

All in all though, it's a fun, challenging, energy-packed workout. I recommend it!",1124236800,4,1704,4.743243243243243

You'll get your heartrate up.

I don't really recommend it though.

Here's why:

- hard to take seriously. Which is ok, but I don't think they're trying to be funny, which makes me feel bad when I have to laugh.

- music could be.. better.

- girlfriend's feet move faster than a ferret on speed. Which is impressive, but hard to mimic. I take comfort in the fact that many of the backup dancers drop some of the steps too.

- It's a pretty long workout. I usually have time for about a half an hour at best, and we're nowhere near the cooldown at that point.

When I finally made it to the end of the video, though, the cooldown was a pleasant surprise. Very nice. Kind of relaxing.",1122681600,6,715,4.205882352941177

There's lots of fun salsa and latin dance moves.  I never feel like I'm really exercising because the moves are fun and the people who are exercising with the instructor are having fun too.  It's definitely a fat burning dance tape that will get your arms, legs, hips and thighs in shape.

HOWEVER don't expect to be dancing Salsa for 40 minutes, in addition to Salsa, the segments on this DVD feature Merengue, Samba and then some Flamenco moves at the end during cool down. The music includes live drums and it will really get you moving. The instructor is great and she's really good explaining and cueing the moves.

Like any other dance, you will need a little bit of coordination because if you have 2 left feet you will find yourself a little lost at times. After warming up to basic Salsa moves, you will then move on to the first segment, which is straight up Salsa. Here you will learn some basic salsa moves and then so some combinations. The second segment is Merengue, the 3rd is a Salsa-Merengue combination, the 4th is a Samba routine (think Carmen Miranda) and the 5th segment is a ""Latin Funk"" routine. The cool down features a combination of Flamenco and Tai-Chi moves along with streches.

Overall this is a lot of fun, it will keep you motivated because it doesn't feel like a workout, it just feels like you got up off the couch to dance and have fun, with the added benefit of breaking a sweat and burning calories. A great addition to your cardio rotaation.",1114473600,8,1320,4.473029045643154

I couldn't believe I had just put in a 40 minute workout.  It is so much fun and you can feel it all over your body!

That is, I would get the benefit of a great workout while learning Salsa at the same time.  It turns out that this is not truly cardio and not really the salsa I was looking for.  First of all, there was almost no warm-up.  My body didn't get the proper warm up and the stretches that it needs prior to a workout.  I also didn't get the salsa instruction that I was looking for.  The instructor really didn't break down anything for the viewer.  In addition, the camera featured everyone from a view that is directly opposite from you.  This is fine when you are doing simple cardiovascular exercises.  However, when you are learning a choreographed dance, it's hard to learn when you are watching people that are ""facing you"" and not facing the same direction as you.  This left me with a lingering question throughout the entire video: should I step with my left or right. I'm not an uncoordinated person, and I found this DVD to be hard to follow.

1890795,1,B00009V7Q4,"I bought this video thinking it would be fun and would break up the monotony of other cardio workouts.  I have to be honest, this was on of the most boring cardio workouts I have ever purchased.  For those of you who have little to no background in dance, I think you would be dissapointed in this workout.  I love salsa dancing as I am Latin myself, but I could never get into this workout.  PS:  If you do purchase this video though, make sure you have enough space in your home, as you will need more than with most cardio workouts.",1098835200,21,535,4.205882352941177
1890796,4,B00009V7Q4,"While this wasn't a Tae-Bo level workout, it was fun, and I worked up a sweat.  I love dance based videos rather than straight aerobic videos, because you can have a little fun.  I've read reviews that said that the instructor didn't break down the the steps enough, and she moved too fast.  Now, I do have a few years of dance experience under my belt, but the moves weren't complicated.  The video may move a little fast, but after you do it once or twice, it doesn't matter.",1096761600,,477,4.325842696629214
1890797,4,B00009V7Q4,"There's a lot to say about this compact little video. Overall, it's a great little workout for days that you want something a little less intense, and it's good for people who are beginner/intermediate. Ultimately, you really get out of it what you put in to it. It's fun and lively, and if you really use your muscles, you'll work up a sweat. The key here is to contract your muscles as you're moving them, so you get a bit of isometric work while you're dancing. If you just flop your arms and legs around, you won't work up a sweat at all. Experienced exercisers and athletes will know this automatically, but some beginners or even intermediates will become frustrated with the level of this workout if they don't do this, and the concept is not really explained in the video.

As an instructor, Giselle is right on top of things. Some of the steps and combinations are a bit tricky, and you have to really pay attention to do the routine well the first or second time, but expect to have to do this video at least three times before you really get it. If you find yourself messing up, just laugh and go back to your basic step. Giselle does have a bit of an accent, but I find her very easy to understand.

Overall, I enjoy this workout. It's fun, and features a variety of women of different shapes and sizes - some not even wearing real workout clothes. The message of this video seems to be that no matter who you are or what fitness level you're at, you can have fun and get a great workout. I don't know about you, but I find that incredibly inspiring.",1093305600,136,1562,4.345890410958904
1890798,5,B00009V7Q4,This workout is a lot of fun! It's a good change from your standard workout. I like to do this one on Friday to kick off the weekend.,1091318400,4,133,3.7857142857142856
1890799,4,B00009V7Q4,"I love this workout DVD.  Giselle is perky, but not overly so, and takes you through the steps at  a good pace.  It's slow enough to catch on during the routine, but not so slow that repeat workouts get monotonous.  I was so engaged learning the steps and keeping up that I didn't realize how sweaty I was getting the first time!  A great workout for people that like to be entertained/occupied instead of ""feeling the burn.""
The dance steps really work the calves, hips, and saddlebag area.  Yay for Latin dancing!",1088553600,7,515,4.543478260869565
1890800,5,B00009V7Q4,"This is a lot of fun. It's great if you like something a little different from the ordinary. I get bored easily, so each week I switch around between hatha/kundalini yoga, TaeBo Cardio, Tae Bo Master Blaster (with weights) and dancing/jump rope/Nordictrack (I did say I get bored, yes?). And my work requires that I be able to lift/carry 40 lbs. I don't have the time to go to a fitness center and don't care to get all jazzed up to do so. I prefer to do my own thing at home and this program is perfect for that. I've done okay by watching my diet and using this and the other videos/DVDs.
The instructor is energenic and vibrant, and although I'm a total klutz when it comes to learning dance moves, she goes about it at a nice enough pace that after a few sessions I even got the hang of it. The warmup works smoothly into the following routines. The beat of the music fits well with the moves, and you just have to have fun doing it!  The 40 minutes goes by so fast it's amazing.
If you're looking for a very fast paced, aerobic, ""take your breath away"" exercise routine, this is *not* it. But if you're looking for something to work that heart, limber up and shed some calories along the way, try it!",1085270400,5,1205,4.262008733624454
1890801,5,B00009V7Q4,"I just got this video and would recommend it to anyone. I love the Latin music so it makes exercising fun! I originally bought it to learn more dance moves instead of work out. I had a good sweat but it didn't put me out of breath. I think it is a good way to get some exercise and not just watch t.v. ;) It will get you ready for other exercise routines that will be more intense. By the way, Giselle comes across really nice and not self-absorbed like other exercise trainers. Give it a try!",1084406400,2,493,4.092783505154639

1890803,4,B00009V7Q4,"This is a great workout video.  It's fun and fast-paced and really gets your heart rate up.  The music is great and Giselle was really motivating.  It's challenging enough that I enjoyed it even tho I already knew a lot of the moves, and had to do it a few times before I really got it down.  Unlike most other workout videos they kept the cameras pulled back most of the time so that you could see the moves.  I would have liked to see some more stretching, and some in the beginning, but if you add some stretching on your own, this is an excellent addition to your workout schedule.",1082592000,,585,4.2342342342342345
1890804,4,B00009V7Q4,"When I first did this workout, I was surprised by the high energy and enthusiasm of the instructor and forgot I was working out I had so much fun! I absolutely love the music and live drumming - good music makes a difference for me. It is a light workout, however, and it does not make your heart rate go up very much. The moves are fast and it'd probably be difficult for someone who is not coordinated or not familiar with latin moves - I am quite coordinated, however, and found the instructor's cues easy to follow and love listening to her.
I did this workout about 4 times the first week I got it because it is so much more fun than my other exercise videos, but I do need more intense and more challenging workouts than this one.
I agree with another reviewer who said the girls looked like strippers - I prefer to see real people with real bodies who don't look like young anorexic barbie dolls. On the plus side, the one man doing the workout is very coordinated and I enjoy watching him.",1080086400,,997,4.28042328042328

I'm not significantly overweight, but I don't have that perfect gym body I used to have, either--nor do I have the time or inclination to pursue it. And, frankly, killing myself doesn't have the appeal it once did--I want exercise to be fun.
This video motivates me to exercise because it is fun. It's low-impact, so it doesn't stress my gym-injured knees and ankles, yet it raises my heart rate enough so I burn calories and stay healthy. If you're a gym rat, it's not for you. If you just want to get fit in the privacy of your own home and have fun doing it, give this a try. Don't be intimidated by the dance moves--you'll pick them up after doing the video a few times.",1079654400,5,732,4.273381294964029

1890807,2,B00009V7Q4,"I wouldn't consider this a workout--unless you call ""marching in place"" exercise.  I was hoping to learn some dance moves while I burned calories, but I got neither.  The instructor moves WAY too fast and doesn't spend enough time teaching the moves.  And even if you can master the moves, the workout itself isn't strenuous enough to really get any results.  I seriously doubt that any of the other ""class members"" got their rock-hard bodies from doing this workout.  That brings me to my last complaint--the Crunch people.  They look like strippers.  What's wrong with using real people like Billy Blanks' Tae Bo videos?!  It's much less intimidating.  I'm thinking of keeping this to try and learn the moves in case I ever go to Miami(maybe I can play the DVD in slow motion?), but I won't be using it as an exercise video.",1078876800,3,826,4.680555555555555
1890808,2,B00009V7Q4,If you want to work out this is not the DVD for you. I barely broke a sweat and my heart rate didn't come close to my target.

1890809,1,B00009V7Q4,"This video bills ""easy to follow steps."" Well, I was lost in the first five minutes. If you have some dance experience, this would probably be a good video for you, but if you're a beginner, steer clear.",1076025600,8,203,4.368421052631579
1890810,3,B00009V7Q4,"I agree with most of the criticisms on the video, except I didn't find the instructor's style abrasive. The beat was great, at times it is fun (when you figure out the moves), just even after doing it a week straight I am still lost at times during this workout.  I am not a natural on dancing, but capable of learning.  Even at best, this would appear to be a moderate itensity workout, if you are looking for intensity go elsewhere.
The two main failings, in my opinion, were: (1) I think the camera on this sort of work out needs to give a near constant full body view of the instructor, sometimes that would cut when I really needed it to stay on her or would cut to her upper body only when I needed to see her feet and (2) think it would have helped to have more time on the moves before trying to integrate into the series.
  Maybe a section of the DVD dedicated to only showing each move and letting you practice that over and over would help.  If you have two left feet I would suggest a good kick type workout for both ease of learning and intensity of the workout.",1075334400,12,1075,4.173913043478261
1890811,4,B00009V7Q4,"I had the Zumba dance workout a year ago where she co-produced & taught VERY slowly for even the most uncordinated person. She teaches with a normal sweet voice with the patience of a monk & uses great analogies to describe subtle moves. She's very fluid & you can see her talent & love of dance easily.
The set design seems stiff, modern, cold, metal, concrete & is very loud with the music & background drum player that she has to almost scream over. The background dancers don't have as much talent or fluidity as her or any other dancers on the Zumba DVDs.
The Crunch people must have forced her on a quick loss diet becuse she looks anerexic. The way she teaches on this video is much more fast-paced, like someone was holding a stopwatch over her head. Her style, talent, enthusiasm, ability to teach & enjoyment is still great.
I bought 2 other Crunch DVDs: Hip Hip & Dance Party. For Giselle & the other workouts, there never seemed time to get into the groove of one type of step/movement before moving on to something new to squeeze it down to the usual 25-40 min most fitness videos are. I now appreciate Giselle even more since I can at least follow her because of her great teaching while I could not with Hip Hop & Dance Party.
This DVD is still SOOO much better then is Kathy Smith's Latin Dance Workout, no one can dance for anything on that one including the ""professional teachers"" who help.

1890813,3,B00009V7Q4,"Giselle is cute, energetic, and clearly a good dancer herself, and I would bet her actual studio classes are a lot more interesting and complex.  But on the DVD, her workout doesn't really get your heart rate up much--even if you add in bounces/jumps, etc.  I tried doing each segment twice and that worked me out a little more (and got me up to ~60 minutes).  This is still a fun workout and I'll keep doing it on days when I want a lighter session, but if you like Paula Abdul's 2 cardio dance workouts, then Crunch Cardio Salsa is going to fall a little short.

As far as the instructor not breaking the steps down enough, I did not think it was that hard to follow.  I would rather have a little trouble the first few times I go through routine then be bored to death the next thousand because it is so slow.

I own many other aerobic workout videos and have no trouble following them.  This one, however, at a fast pace, without slowing down to teach each one.

And if you miss a step the music will keep you moving anyway!  It felt more like dancing for fun than a workout.  That doesn't mean I don't sweat or get my heart pumping during it.  For advanced participants, that are some extra steps or hops you can incorporate to raise the intensity.  I would definitely recommend this video to all exercise levels.",1068076800,,491,4.46067415730337
1890817,3,B00009V7Q4,"I just bought and tried this video for the first time today.  I agree with a previous reviewer that intermediate and advanced level exercisers won't get a good cardio workout.  I work out every day, and when the instructor suggested speaking to see how hard you were working, I checked my heart rate and had a hard time finding it!  The steps were a little tricky, but I mostly got them after a couple tries; however, I have been doing Minna's emergency workout for a while before this, so I'd seen the moves before.  Overall I thought it was fun, but more for cardio beginners.  Maybe when I know the steps better I can kick it up somehow to get my heart rate up.  I'm glad, though, that I only paid $6 for it.
ADDITIONAL COMMENT:
I just finished this workout for the second time.  I definitely enjoyed it more this time and was able to put more into it to actually raise my heart rate.  Still probably only give it 3 1/2 to 4 stars and still definitely a beginner workout, but very fun for light days.",1064620800,,1003,4.297872340425532

Before purchasing this video i would purchase something that will let you become more familar with the steps like Minna's Emergency Workout or Kathy Smiths Latin Grooves. This dvd is for all levels but for intermediates and advanceds this is not going to get your heart pumping enough where it is really challenging.
