2080413,3,B0002DRDQE,"Though it is good to see good ol' Talk Soup's Greg K. getting movie roles, I would have to say this one of De Niro's worst films.  All in all, your basic blah movie.  A rehashing of the ""scary child"" theme that has been done before and better.",1083369600,,243,4.041666666666667
2080414,3,B0002DRDQE,"I don't want to give too much away about this film, especially since it has some sci-fi/supernatural elements that could be ruined by giving away too much. The basic plot: A couple (Greg Kinnear, Rebecca Romin-Stamos) have a son who has suffered a trauma and literally returned from death. In time, he has recurring nightmares which are so bad he actually goes comatose. De Niro plays the boy's doctor.
  The movie has a satisfying creepiness to it but has some serious plot flaws and, at times, a very slow pace. I found De Niro's performance to be less than stellar. Still, it is a watchable film and, for fans of horror/suspense, is certainly better than average. Not great, not terrible, but worth seeing if you are fans of the actors and enjoy suspense/horror. You might prefer to wait till it is in video stores, however.",1082246400,14,827,4.696551724137931
2080415,2,B0002DRDQE,"What was my problem? This is an attempt to make a ""new"" movie by taking bits and pieces from a group of older movies or a medley of B movies, that I watched through the years because I was bored. (What is coming next could, I guess, be considered a sort of spoiler, if it wasn't so confusing.) Lets see: there is a ""father"", or actually two ""fathers"" and add three kids or is it one kid with the issues of all the others. Sounds like a mess? To make things worse, take the two crazy fathers, with the youngest being one of the most unlikable characters of the entire medley of B movies. It is definitely a mess.  I gave it a two because the little kid did a great job. The rest, lets just say, OVERRATED actors, even if one was quite famous.

2080422,1,B0002DRDQE,"This could've been an interesting film. But it isn't. It is a bit slow-moving, and there is little action until the end. The end is simply ridiculous, though. There is absolutely nothing plausible about this film's ending. The idea of secretly cloning a person has some plausibility to it (and could have provided an interesting framework for a different kind of film).  But the rest is total garbage -- culminating in a sudden appearance by Greg Kinear (the father) to save the day -- even though he had been  severely bludgeoned and left to die in a burning Church, and had no idea where to find his wife and kid, even if he was in perfect health. But, nevermind all that. The end.",1486425600,2,683,4.544715447154472
2080423,2,B0002DRDQE,"I enjoyed this movie, but it had a few holes.
This movie needed some more suspense or horror scenes to make it more interesting.
It also needed a stronger plot with more depth to the characters.

The parents (Paul and Jessie) and the doctor never age - -
eight years pass (plus nine months of pregnancy) and they look exactly the same,
except Jessie cut her hair.

Adam looks exactly the same, except he also cut his hair.

I looked up the little actor who played Adam, who is now an adult.
He played an eight year old in the movie, but he was actually eleven at the time.
I thought that he looked too big to be eight years old.

The beginning of the movie and the ending of the movie move very quickly.
But the middle drags to the point of boring.

The beginning is too quick so that we don't get a chance to care about the characters - -
we know nothing about them except that Paul is a teacher.
The ending is also too quick so that nothing is explained.

The movie starts with Paul getting mugged.
Then the sweet muggers just let him go because one of them recognizes him as the best teacher he ever had.
I guess the point of that scene was to show that the neighborhood was dangerous,
so these parents were very glad to take the doctor's offer to move.

The doctor finds a job for Paul,
finds them a big house,
and even buys furniture for them,
but they never get suspicious as to why the doctor is doing so much for them,
when there are so many parents who have lost a child who would do anything (for nothing) to try that cloning experiment.

All that the doctor had to do was read obituaries (which he does at the end) to find recently deceased children.
The doctor made it sound like Paul and Jessie were the only possible parents for his experiment.
The doctor stresses that the cloning must be done within 72 hours of the child's death - -
so that would rule out any desperate parents at his fertility clinic.

But it is not explained how the doctor found Jessie, whom he knew before, right after Adam was killed - -
he said that he had been looking for Jessie before Adam died, but he never said why.

The parents don't seem to have anything to live for, except for their son - -
they move away and disappear and leave everyone whom they knew to start a new life (and they do it again at the end), just for their son.
Doesn't anyone miss them or try to find them?
No relatives or friends cared about them?
They had a big birthday party at the beginning, but no one wondered about them.
And didn't they miss anyone?
Adam was their whole reason for living.
It was easy enough for Paul to find Zachary's nanny, but no one tried to find Paul or Jessie.

Zachary's nanny just invites this strange man into her house.
She tells him everything about Zachary and never asks why he wants to know.

The doctor goes into hiding.
Didn't anyone care enough to look for him either - - except for the newspapers?
Did he also live for his child?
We see him reading the obituaries, so we know that he wants to try his experiment with another couple,
but we don't know how he can do that when he is not working at the fertility clinic anymore.

The doctor cloned Adam and, in the process, he took some DNA from his own son (Zachary) and mixed the two boys together.
Kind of like the story of The Fly, where the guy gets himself blended with a fly.
Adam's DNA could only be used within 72 hours, but Zachary's small amount of DNA could last indefinitely.
And, after cloning Adam, the doctor still had enough of Zachary's DNA to try the experiment again - -
even though he only had a very small amount of Zachary's DNA because Zachary died in a fire a long time ago.

The doctor smashed Paul's head in at the church, and then left him there to die in the fire in a pool of blood.
But Paul somehow regained consciousness and got himself home, just fine, no head injury and no more blood.
Did he call the Fire Department before he left the burning church?

So, when Adam passes the point of the age when he died before, he suddenly changes.
Nightmares and sleepwalking and night terrors start.
Then visions.
Then Adam is suddenly violent.
He drowns another child - - and the parents know that he is guilty, but they don't really care - - and the police never question anyone.
Then Adam tries to kill Jessie.
But Jessie and Paul are not afraid that Adam will try to kill either of them - - they don't seem worried over Adam at all.
So, the family moves again and puts Adam into therapy.
They assume that Adam is suddenly not dangerous anymore.
But, of course, in the last five minutes of the movie, we see that Adam has simply fooled everyone.
So, as the credits roll, we get the hint that Adam will probably kill his parents, and maybe others, eventually.
And the doctor is safe and in hiding, and he will probably clone Zachary into another child.",1482969600,3,4837,4.27103825136612
2080424,4,B0002DRDQE,"I was hoping Godsend would be a little better than it was to be honest.  It's still decent, but it's probably more on the suspense side than horror.

It's about a husband and wife (Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romjin) who lose their child after the mother hands him a black basketball and encourages him to go outside the store to play with it.  This is a minor thing to complain about, but how cliched is it that the boy would bounce the ball, it'd get away and go right in the path of a car swerving to avoid a predicament?  Of course you know what this means- the boy goes after the ball without noticing the car and... yeah.  We all saw this coming the moment the mother handed him the ball.  Sorry little rant there!  I realize this serves as an easy way to get to the next part of the story, but there's other ways of going about it besides relying on cliched moments of writing.

Anyway after the boys death, in comes Robert De Niro.  He explains that he's a fertility doctor who believes he can clone their son (played by Cameron Bright).  He gives the parents 72 hours to make a decision because any longer the option would not be possible. Sort of unrealistic that Robert wouldn't even wait for the funeral to be over before boisterously disrupting the husband and wife over the matter.  How inappropriate!

After battling their sadness and anger, the couple decide to go through with the cloning realizing they can't live without their son.  When the mother gives birth there's a momentary period of concern as the clone baby doesn't let out a cry, but then Robert counts to 50 and the baby cries.  Everyone's relieved.  The story then settles in 8 years into the future as young Cameron is a kid now.  They even repeat his 8th birthday party which is kind of warped when you think about it.

Everything appears to be fine for a little while- Cameron's a normal healthy boy.  That is until Cameron starts having night terrors that show images of himself walking down school hallways and seeing kids on the other side of the glass smacking the window and giving him the creeps, including seeing the non-clone Cameron wearing the same red jacket he had on when he died.  When this matter gets discussed, the parents think maybe Cameron is remembering what happened before he died.  When the parents mention this to Robert, he admits he doesn't know what happens after the boy turns 8 years old since details on the cloning haven't been finalized yet.  This of course concerns the parents and they worry poor Cameron will have a lifetime of night terrors and other mental issues.

Without spoiling too much, it appears that poor Cameron is being encouraged through these night terrors and other strange illusions that he must do harm to people including beating classmates with sticks, spitting in teachers faces and even swinging an axe at his worried mom.  However he never does as much harm as I'd have hoped.  The story's light in the regard.  However there's enough atmosphere that the movie is definitely appealing.  The segments with Cameron finally getting his revenge on a school bully are really good, and growing increasingly and strangely quiet is another interesting aspect of his character.

I think this is a great movie overall but there's a couple confusing things.  It was never really known if Cameron was imagining seeing the original Cameron or actually seeing him for real (the shower curtain scene comes to mind which has tremendous atmosphere by the way).  Also for some reason, instead of acting like an evil twin to the other Cameron, he's instead turning into a troublemaker male student that once attended his school- a kid who would do many twisted things and cause harm such as set trashcans on fire and other stuff before he eventually died.  This is all really weird and I'm not sure why the story would focus on this particular kid instead of the two Cameron's.  It seems the story was trying to venture into unnecessary territory by adding more than it should have.

Still, the movie delivers with the suspense and wonderful acting by all the characters, including the parents, and of course Rober De Niro is tremendous as a doctor.  Going into the movie I wasn't sure Robert would be able to pull off playing a doctor but he does it really well.  Highly recommended, but remember the movie's light on the horror.  It's more about this clone Cameron trying to figure out his existence and the parents doing everything they can to prevent him from finding out about it.",1464825600,,4506,4.653603034134008

2080428,5,B0002DRDQE,"I would have given this film a 3.5, however, felt it necessary  to be more generous in order to help balance the scales. Usually guided by ""Rotten Tomatoes"" and other sites where top critics give their opinions on cinema, I sometimes take a chance and go by my own radar and reactions (as I did with the film ""The Happening"" starring Mark Wahlberg & Zooey Deschanel. Well written & directed, acting superb, it was poorly received by viewers & critics yet I predict it will someday become one of the classic sci-fi thrillers). This film, Godsend, is not Oscar material I'll admit, however, it is quite enjoyable. The acting is quite good as well as the directing. The scenery is beautiful. It presents an interesting storyline.

2080434,2,B0002DRDQE,Godsend's premise is somewhat interesting but its execution is far to predictable and mundane ultimately its your standard piece of escapism and not much more then that.

Once Adam II reaches the age of when Adam I died, he starts to see visions of his dead self and believes he is doomed. Pretty scary huh? ...if you're eight and your parents inform you that you were cloned...I guess it could be, not that any of you would do that to your 8 year old. Adam II has some vague memories that manifest as dreams. He has become reckless also, as if he has a death wish. AND he exhibits aberrant behavior, such as spitting in the face of his teacher...Tell me you're not scared now!

Gref Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn play a couple who loses their only son in unexpected tragedy. Just when the funeral ends, out comes Robert de Niro, as doctor/researcher, to save the day. He promises the emotially vulnerable parents he can bring back their son, though the word cloning is never mentioned.

After some hesitation on Greg Kinnear's part, the grieving parents opt to go with the good doctor's advice and try to bring back their little boy. They should have known it was a bad idea as soon as Dr. DeNiro promised them free treatment, a house and job 300 miles from where they live. The educated couple miss all the red flags and go along with what will surely be a human genetic engineering story gone terribly wrong.

At first, everything seems perfect. The baby born to them looks exactly like their son, and they even give him the same name, Adam. Adam was the first man on earth and he is also the first evil clone. Things go awry when Adam passes his eighth birthday and lives longer than his original self.

I don't care if it is supposed to be a horror movie or not, in my opinion, it should be a wake-up call in regards to genetic manipulation. Aha!! That's why I think this movie should get at least 5 stars.  In a very short time in the future, movies like Godsend will not be classified as Science-fiction anymore. Science will be able to provide us with a living cloned human being (or maybe it has already) When this happens, ""Godsend"" will make a lot more sense to the reviewers who underated this movie. The downside is, that cloning is a brutal attack against the naural order and therefore should be forever banned.  This movie and ""the Sixth Day"" show us the atrocities we will face in the future when unscrupulous scientists, (like the doctor in this one) introduce in the clones their hidden agendas with  horrifying repercussions.  Don't be fooled, they are already messing around with stem cells and human embryos.  Soon (if not already), genetic manipulation will be the downfall of humankind; the end of life as we know it. A treason to the natural order and to millions of years of evolution!!  For all these reasons, I rate the movie with 5 stars. I hope we can (still) learn the message...........",1191628800,,1377,4.6652892561983474
2080440,2,B0002DRDQE,"Okay, so I have many a bone to pick with this movie.  First of all, the theatrical trailer made one believe they were in for a very scary good time.  This is false advertisement in my opinion.  The movie is not scary.  Second of all, it sports a cast that includes quite frankly the best actor to ever walk this Earth, at least he was when he was in his prime, and so to have Robert DeNiro dumb himself down so much for a role is just irritating to me.  Third, it opens with promise and even ends with promise but somewhere in the middle it loses all sense of surroundings and just goes stupid on us.  The plot is one that with a little tweaking could have been stellar.  I say stellar and I mean that in total B-movie horror takes of the word.  This could have become a grade-A B-movie if that makes any sense, but instead it became a C-grade C-movie and that's a shame, a real shame.

The film revolves around the Duncan family, Paul, Jessie and their son Adam.  You can tell right off the bat that this family is very close-knit.  They love each other more than anything else and would do anything for each other.  Especially evident is the love between Jessie and Adam.

Something tragic must happen though and this comes in the form of a hit-and-run.  While out shopping with his mother for tennis shoes young Adam wonders outside to bounce his basketball (the one his father bought him for his birthday) when he's struck by an oncoming car and killed.  The Duncan family falls apart after his death and they begin to digress within themselves until they meet Doctor Richard Wells who offers to give them their son back through cloning.  This is of course absurd, and quite frankly illegal.  The Duncan's would have to move away from their family and friends and cut off all ties if they were to concede with the procedure.  After giving it careful thought and consideration (sure) they decide to go ahead with the cloning and nine months later Jessie gives birth to her son all over again.  Life is good until Adam turns eight (the age in which he originally died) and then things take a turn for the worse.  His behavior changes and he begins to suffer from night terrors that may or may not have significance.

This conclusion is one that, albeit a bit on the predictable side, actually does the film some good.  We wonder throughout the film just what Richard's hidden agenda could be (because you just know he has one) and when it's revealed it's not as horrid as it could have been.  What is horrid though is the acting here, especially on the part of Romijn and Kinnear.  I'm a fan of Kinnear's but films like this do nothing for him.  DeNiro just can't seem to catch a break lately.  He's one of our finest actors ever to work a day in this business but he keeps selecting the worst possible films for himself.  This could be the worst.  The one shining light here though is Cameron Bright, who plays Adam.  He is one creepy kid, and he's used that to his advantage in his film choices (watch him in `Butterfly Effect' or in `Birth' to get a better understanding).  Here he's a little wasted since he really isn't given the opportunity to really scare us, at least not for a lasting period of time.

That brings me to my biggest reservation with this film.  It's really not scary, at all.  With the material they had the opportunity to real nail this and make it just horrifically unsettling, but instead they took a very tame approach (maybe in an effort to get the PG-13 rating) and in my opinion ruined what they had going.  When you see that of the five endings shot for this film they chose the tamest one you realize that they just didn't know what they were doing.  I can easily think of a few ways they could have saved this film from mediocrity, in the final few frames alone (come on, boy in a shed, hatchet in his hand, mother in front of him...does anyone really have to survive in this film?) but alas, everything has to have a happy ending these days, well, sort of.

So, `Godsend' could have been a much better film but quite frankly it's not, which is sad, because I really wanted it to be.",1190678400,2,4119,4.387862796833773
2080441,2,B0002DRDQE,"After eagerly anticipating this remake for months, and after a close viewing with careful attention to each plot turn, the only question I was left with was: what?

The Godsend is like a professional baseball player in a little league batting cage. There should be no way to miss. But this clunker misses over and over in spite of its many opportunities to achieve.

It has De Niro. It has an unsettling story line and a good novel as its basis. A dead child, a secluded location, bad dreams and weird science. How can you go wrong with all that?

Somehow, it goes wrong and horribly so. This film falls flat from the beginning regardless of those delicious ingredients. The story itself is muddy and new layers are added regularly without finesse. Tired cliches don't result in the chills they so obviously were meant to inspire. The child, clearly meant to provide spookiness through the mystery of his birth, is far from spooky. You cannot simply paste a blank expression on a boy of eight and expect an audience to recoil. You cannot simply set a scene in a shadowy, sprawling house and expect that atmosphere to carry that scene to the audience.

The Godsend had promise but failed to deliver. If you read the novel and liked it, if you're dying to see a film version, you're better of going back in time. While the 1980 version of the Godsend was not an outright screamer, by the standards of the 2004 adaptation, it's masterful.",1162512000,3,1435,4.6156862745098035

2080443,2,B0002DRDQE,"`Godsend' attempts to capitalize on our vague fear of recent cloning techniques, but sheer predictability and indescribably vapid acting from Robert De Niro undermines what should be a much more insightful and chilling thriller. Surely the topic deserves to be made into a film again, but few things in `Godsend' actually could be called a success that is stimulating intellectually or else.

The story is nothing new, but that is not a problem. For the record it is about newly bereaved husband and wife (played by Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijin), to whom a mysterious scientist (Robert De Niro) approaches, offering a chance to resurrect their dead son by a still experimental method. As this is not based on a Michael Crichton novel, the film skips any scientific details as to the method and its plausibility. All we have to do is to see and believe it.

Anyway, things go pretty well for the parents at first, but then they find something awfully wrong with what they thought as `Godsend' - of course they find it - but how they find it is really problematic. I cannot reveal too much about it, not because doing so would spoil your fun, but because you just don't get much fun from the beginning. I hate to say these things in this sarcastic manner, but before the director Nick Hamm (`The Hole' starring Keira Knightley) builds up the atmosphere, it all vanishes into the air with thrill-less acting and suspense-free script.

Not that the film is totally devoid of eerie moments. Thanks to effective acting from Cameron Bright as the named Adam, there are some minor shocks. Because of the decent performances from the Kinnear and Romijin, the portrait of the ordinary family who suffer looks fairly convincing, but, oh, no, please someone tell Mr. Robert De Niro that he doesn't need to work so hard if he got as many as six Oscar nominations in his career (and won two!). His last nomination was back in 1992 for his acting in `Cape Fear' but since then I haven't seen him in a good film that matches his reputation in the 70s and 80s. OK, I loved `Meet the Parents' and `Analyze This' but not its sequels, let alone `Hide and Seek' `Showtime' '15 Minutes' and oh, dear, `The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle.' Someone, please do something before it's too late.

`Godsend' is a typical thriller that comes with the logo of The Lions Gate Films. It is a B-suspense with some redeeming points, but thrills and great acting are not among them.",1161475200,4,2452,4.682134570765661
2080444,3,B0002DRDQE,"When their son Adam (Bright) is hit by a car and killed Paul & Jessie Duncan (Kinnear & Stamos) are lost in teir greif.  That is until they meet Richard Wells (De Niro) who offers them an alternative to grieving...cloning.  He promises that he can resurect their son Adam and they can experience his life all over again.  Of course they are interested, Jessie moreso than Paul who is a bit sceptical, and they eventually cave in and agree.  This uproots their whole life, moving them away from friends and family so that no one can know what they are about to do (beings that it's illegal).  The only problem is that as Adam passes the mark of is death he starts to act strangely, and he forms a unique bond with Richard that is starting to weird out Paul.

This movie had so much potential, and with a little tweaking of the script it could have been all it should have been.  The fact remains that the scares are few and far in between and the character development is really B-Movie status.  There are a few jumps but they are hard to relive, and the ending just falls so short of what it could have been.  Robert De Niro is one of the best actors we have, but even he can't save this movie from mediocricy.  Cameron Bright is the only actor that gives De Niro a run for his money, chewing up his role perfectly.  This kid just looks scary, but he's far better performed in 'Birth' then this.  As the film ties itself together your given a really decent plot, predictable maybe, but decent...it's just exicuted poorly.

'Godsend' will not scare you, 'Godsend' will most likely dissapoint you, if not for the reason alone that this could have and should have been so much better!",1153958400,3,1681,4.4188311688311686
2080445,3,B0002DRDQE,"Viewing the trailers for the movie ""Godsend"", it is abundantly clear that the individuals marketing this movie would like to show their potential audience that the film is a thought provoking thriller that raises all sorts of questions about the nature of humanity and the moral implications of cloning a previously deceased human being (and presumably presenting some kind of answer to those questions).  Those individuals were gleefully lying through their teeth.

Godsend starts off with plenty of potential to be a great movie.  The viewers are introduced to the happily married Paul and Jessie Duncan, and their young son Adam, who is celebrating his birthday.  All the cutesy young son birthday antics occur, letting everyone know just how much the couple loves their only child.  After everyone is sufficiently indoctrinated with the fact that these people *really* love their kid, he is of course offed by a wayward vehicle that apparently felt like flying through the air and crushing a poor youngster in front of his mother.  Enter genius doctor specializing in fertility, Robert De Niro to seemingly resurrect the dead through advanced cloning techniques.  Herein it would appear the movie is about to start making some kind of point.  Five seconds later about 3/4 of the people watching Godsend are going to understand the ""twist"" that occurs later on, all they while hoping fervently that they are wrong, they just misread the signs, this couldn't possibly happen in this film. Of course, they are unfortunately all correct.

For no apparent reason Godsend descends from intelligent ethical questioning of modern day science into a ""jump at the sudden sound"" quasi-horror movie with no purpose whatsoever.  If only it had been marketed as such from the beginning!  As a sudden shock style horror movie, it actually isn't all that bad.  There have certainly been much, much worse scary flicks.  Godsend does fall prey to the same pitfalls of all ""BOO!"" horror movies, such as the same scare occuring over and over, people running after someone screaming their name repeatedly even though it is quite clear they are neither going to turn around nor answer, and the  characters doing blatantly stupid things that make the audience throw their popcorn and yell ""Don't go down in the basement!!"". Despite all this, there are some geniunely effective uses of interesting camerawork coupled with slowly building music to produce a few noteworthy scenes.  However, anyone wanting to have a viewpoint expressed on the issues of mortality, cloning, resurrection, familial ties, destiny, or man's ability to play God should definitely pass by Godsend, as it doesn't even attempt to answer any of these questions that it half-heartedly raises.

For those fortunate enough to know absolutely nothing about this movie, feel free to watch and enjoy a decent ride with pretty good acting by some big name stars.  Anyone one who was subjected to the insanely blatant lies of the trailers should understand that Godsend is simply a horror/thriller along the same vein as ""The Omen"" or ""The Good Son"" wrapped around a current hot issue to help it sell.",1147651200,3,3146,5.089494163424124
2080446,1,B0002DRDQE,"If you're a horror fan then you already know how Godsend is supposed to go. Take one mad scientist (DeNiro, who apparently has no shame about doing cheese ball roles like this), take two dumb but grief stricken parents (Kinnear, who spends the whole movie yelling  the same obscenity over and over and John Stamos's ex wife, who spends the whole movie crying, shrieking or looking shocked) and one creepy little kid (Cameron Bright) and you might get thrills and chills. Instead, you get a really bad film.

First, it has significant plot and logic holes. The cloned lad looks just like the dead child that the parents lost. Although siblings resemble each other unless they're twins they aren't identical. The movie never shows the couple trying to explain this to their family and friends. Second, Kinnear makes an impossibly easy  visit to St. Pius, a school that was closed due to a fire 8 years ago. I can not think of a school official  in the United States who would let valuable property just sit like that for almost a decade. Not only is the half burnt school still there but Kinnear is able to break in and somehow goes to the exact classroom that holds the clue he needs. When he gets to the classroom he picks up the exact drawing that helpfully has the name and address of the place he needs to visit next.

Later Kinnear shows up at the address and meets that old staple of the horror film, THE OLD FAMILY SERVANT, in this case she is also the BLACK PERSON WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON AND HAS WAITED YEARS TO TELL IT.  If a crazed looking stranger showed up at my door I'd call the cops. In Godsend, the  old family servant lets him in. Thanks  to this helpful plot device Kinnear finds out that --- golly--- the mad scientist pulled a fast one and instead of a perfect clone of his dead son he's saddled with a clone of the scientist's dead psychotic child. Oopsy!

You then have the typical frantic car ride back home to rescue his wife who's about to end up like Lee Remick in the Omen. On the way Kinnear gets into a fight with DeNiro and a fire breaks out in a church that only a second before was filled with people attending a funeral. Apparently nobody stopped to go to the bathroom and nobody is still in the parking lot loading the coffin into a hearse. Okaaaaaay. The fire is apparently no biggie to the cops or fireman because 6 months go by afterwards and none of the leads has to explain their part in an apparent arson. Kinnear and Stamos have a baby Ted Bundy on their hands and their solution is to just move to a different town.  The movie has that same old trick ending (everything looks peaceful and then something scary happens) that we've seen a hundred times before. All in all, the Godsend was a waste of time for everyone involved, especially the viewers.",1143676800,,2793,4.426900584795321

They try this procedure and impregnate the mother with the new ""clone"". She gives birth to a boy who looks identical to the one they lost. At first everything is going good until the boy starts acting strangely. There are no big suspense scenes at all and again, this movie is rather boring.

2080448,1,B0002DRDQE,"Godsend (Nick Hamm, 2004)

Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

Godsend concerns a couple, Paul and Jessie Duncan (Grek Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) whose child is killed in an auto accident. A former professor of Jessie's, Richard Wells (Robert DeNiro), approaches them not long after the funeral and makes them an offer that they somehow can't refuse-- cloning their son. Everything goes well until the son, Adam (Cameron Bright, of the upcoming X-Men 3), passes the age at which his former self died. Then, things start going a little weird...

Now, the movie itself is cheeseball enough. DeNiro, whose career has pretty much gone into the toilet recently from a quality standpoint (viz. Meet the Parents/Fockers, The Score, Analyze This/That, etc. etc. ad nauseam), turns in what is essentially his usual twenty-first century performance; it's passable, but it's not the guy who won two acting Oscars and was nominated for four others. Kinnear, and Romijn-Stamos, at least, don't have stellar careers behind them to make us wonder where things went so horribly wrong that they needed the money this desparately; both turn in reasonable performances given that the parts they're playing are incredibly silly. Bright does his best to be a happy-go-lucky kid one minute and suitably scary the next, but can't quite pull it off. (They should've changed the sex of the kid and pulled in Dakota Fanning, who pretty much defines creepy these days.) But without one scene, it would've been another predictable below-average piece of celluloid cheese, good for turning your brain off for a couple of hours and nothing more.

But no. Hamm, making his first picture in America, was perhaps unaware of the way some things work on this side of the pond-- specifically, product placement. It's pretty obvious Homestyle Bakes paid good, good money for product placement in this movie, because during one scene-- a climactic one, no less, where great pieces of the plot are revealed to the five people who didn't see them coming-- there's a shelf full of Homestyle Bakes in almost every camera angle, and the product placement is so obvious that at times the camera almost risks going out of focus on Kinnear to make sure THE AUDIENCE SEES THESE HOMESTYLE BAKES. The effect is, quite simply hilarious. It's a good thing the movie's so predictable, because if you didn't see it coming, you'd be laughing too hard to miss the big reveal.

Pathetic. I hope DeNiro, one of our finest actors, pulls his career up by the bootstraps relatively soon. * ",1126483200,3,2535,4.9810874704491725
2080449,1,B0002DRDQE,"The film initiates brilliantly; the first third part is reveals an absolute domain of the narrative technique, supported by a terrible disgrace and a hazardous decision.

But, suddenly the script experiments a visible twist, when you remind an essential and strangely missed previous work: La machine a French film of Francois Dupeyron. Serious fissures in the script affect as a corrosive acid that weakens a formidable and promising story.

The picture is told frenetically, (who can deny it?), but there are too many common places: The character of Dr Wells for instance, was somehow wasted; he is the dramatic nerve of the story and the suspense and being the medical authority why did he have to wait so long to make such experiment? Obviously you may argue there is a tacit attraction with Rebecca, but you miss at least one or two flashbacks that may well work out as solid devices to emphasize the drama.

This movie will be forgotten very soon from your memory. It was a fabulous idea but the relevant transcendence you might expect, died in the attempt.",1122249600,,1063,4.861878453038674
2080450,1,B0002DRDQE,"When Robert De Niro appears in a film this bad, it seems like a cry for help. Maybe De Niro is ready and willing to retire, but lacks the financial security. Driven to desperation, he might be jumping on any lame script that crosses his desk. I'm reminded of the twilight of Orson Welles' career, during which the once-heralded filmmaker and actor resorted to TV spots and cartoon voiceover work to pay the bills.

The story, such as it is: A couple (Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) lose their son (Cameron Bright) in a car accident shortly after his eighth birthday. A mad scientist (De Niro) appears out of the woodwork and talks them into letting him clone their late son. When their newly-cloned son reaches the age of eight, all hell breaks loose...or it would, if this were a better movie.

Perhaps in an effort to keep a PG-13 rating or perhaps due to a lack of imagination, the ""hell"" that is unleashed amounts to nothing more than naughty behavior and bad dreams. By the time the evil clone ups the ante, the story has dragged on uneventfully for far too long, piling improbability on improbability.

I'm not even going to get into the questionable science at the core of the film's premise.

My advice to you: Watch _The Omen_ and _The Omen II_ instead of this garbage. They aren't exactly great movies either, but they're in a similar vein (innocent looking caucasian boy is actually evil incarnate) and they're more entertaining by far.

My advice to Robert De Niro: Unless you want audiences to wonder why you were ever considered an A-list actor, you'd better stay away from stinkers like this in the future.",1121904000,2,1630,4.685314685314685

2080453,3,B0002DRDQE,"I suppose ""Godsend"" could have been a really great film had it been a human drama. The topic, cloning, is a controversial subject, and thus if someone talented was writing this film, or at least someone with an idea in their head, the movie could have made a social commentary. But, instead of talking about what kind of movie ""Godsend"" could have been I'm going to take Roger Ebert's advice and talk about what ""Godsend"" is actually about.

 ""Godsend"" is about Paul and Jessie Duncan (Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who must come to terms with the death of their 8 year old son Adam (Cameron Bright). Soon after the boys death a doctor, Richard Wells (Robert De Niro) tells the parents he has invented a way to clone a human being. Paul and Jessie soon get into an agrument over the subject. Jessie wants the doctor to clone their son Paul doesn't. This scene offers the worst dialogue exchange I've heard in a while. Paul tells his wife ""I can't believe you're considering this."" To which she yells back ""I can't believe you're not!"" Now how are you going to argue that? Of course the couple then decide to go ahead with the idea.

 ""Godsend"" is a film with a lot of faults. There is no human element added to the story. We never feel we know Paul and Jessie or for that matter Adam. We never feel their grief. The movie takes place over a 16 year period and never once does age show on any characters face. They look the same from the begining of the movie till the end. And I thought the movie's conclusion is sort of sprung on us, not fully played out. But despite all of these short comings I liked this movie. Why? I just found it suspenseful. Notice I didn't say scary. I don't think of this movie as a horror film. I think of it more so as a thriller. I thought the performances by Kinnear and Stamos were effective. I was drawn into the story.

 A lot of you might think I'm crazy. I've read only a few of the comments here on Amazon. They all more or less say the same thing. Even I have touched upon some of the movie's weak points. Everyone thinks the movie just doesn't gel together but I thought the script by Mark Bomback if anything was able to involve me enough into the story where I wanted to see how the movie ends. And that is all I can ask for. People must have walked into the movie with high expectations, maybe that's why I wasn't disappointed. I was expecting junk. I don't think people are giving this movie a fair chance. People are expecting more from the movie than I think it originally intended.

 I talked about Kinnear and Stamos giving, at times, effective performances but I want to say a word about Robert De Niro. There was a time De Niro acted in great films; ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Godfather pt. 2"" , ""Raging Bull"", ""Mean Streets"" and then something happened and De Niro started acting in lighter fare. Somehow he's become a comedic actor; ""Meet the Parents"", ""Showtime"", ""Anaylze This"" and its sequel. What happened? Does De Niro feel he has nothing to prove anymore? Now he wants to take it easy and live off his past films? Or has Hollywood simply run out of good ideas? Or has the public grown tired of actors like De Niro, Pacino, and Nicholson? Have we become too comic book crazy? Is there no longer a place for these actors is it all about who looks good in a cape? This is something people should start thinking about before they bash De Niro's recent roles.

 So is ""Godsend"" a great movie? No. But I do think it is an example of mindless fun Hollywood entertainment. I think the movie can carry your interest and at least it doesn't try to seem important.

 Bottomline: Worthwhile movie that has effective performaces by Kinear and Stamos and an offbeat one by De Niro. Despite the movie's flaws, and there are plenty, I strangely found myself entertained.",1117324800,3,3814,4.432857142857143
2080454,2,B0002DRDQE,"The mainly negative views recited here correctly tell you that this scary movie isn't very scary. What they do not tell you is this is one of the first cinematic endeavors trying to exploit the new science of cloning, which has been successful with cats and birds around the world.

What the script sought, no doubt, was to state arguments about whether cloning is or can be a life-assisting tool. The Greg Kinnear character, who begins the film on the moral high ground, immediately states the case against cloning but yields to his wife (Rebecca Romjin, looking much too young to have fathered a pair of 8-year-olds back to back), who can no longer procreate and wants her dead kid back.

The Robert DeNiro character, a doctor and genius, is the amoral foil to Kinnear, who suggests the medical experiment is a way to metaphorically put Humpty Dumpty back together again in the couple's now shattered empty void of a life.

With this premise, the film could have migrated in many directions, all of which could have argued the case for or against the new science of cloning, which evidence worldwide has shown actually works.

What the movie did instead was become a typical horror film in the Damien strain, without any of the requisite style or fright that makes those movies famous and gives them lasting value.

Still, I thought there were some good things herein. The movie was effective for about an hour or 70 minutes, until the time the DeNiro character showed his true ways. Once exposed, that portion of the plot became quicksand as attempts at cheap thrills and faux horror instead replaced intelligence in the script.

I also enjoyed DeNiro's perforamnce as an understated medical quack willing to be pushed around by the milquetoast-turned-he man Kinnear over the treatment of his cloned boy. This is a far different character than the ones DeNiro has portrayed in his gangster, casino and New York films.

So, like I always say in these bad movies, at least there is something to like about it. What is sad is that, given the overall plot mechanism revolving around the science of cloning, this film missed a large opportunity to cinematically explore a moral ground that has, thus far, not been examined in any meaningful way since ""Frankenstein"".

And with an actor of DeNiro's stature on board to carry the goods, this could have been one of the memorable films of 2004 or any other year. Instead, it is mostly a miss with little lasting value.",1116892800,,2463,4.778823529411765

Rarely do I make such statements about movies, hoping to find some good in them that makes them worthy of at least three stars(read my reviews of SciFi Channel flicks if you don't believe me).  Unfortunately, ""Godsend"" takes a contemporary subject(cloning) and turns it into a bad rehash of ""Frankenstein"" with Robert De Niro playing the deranged scientist hoping to play the Big Man.  Throw in Greg Kinnear as the only decent acting person in this movie and Rebecca Romjin for eye-candy and you have plenty of potential.

All of the elements were there:  1) a risky experiment involving both social mores and emotions  2) a mad scientist 3) a creepy, creepy kid  4) and alterior motives.  Sounds good, right, but everything falls flat before this horse even gets out of the gate.  It's a plodding, boring, dull film with no real attempt at being a good movie.  It's as if the writer was thinking that he could wrangle fans of ""The Forgotten"" and ""The X-files"" together and capitalize on them.  No sirree.

In short, skip this snoozer that has a pitiful beginning, a boring middle, and a non-existent ending.  Only Kinnear manages to hold it together long enough to make you pull for him in his quest to find out what's really going on with his kid.  He's the only reason I'm giving two stars to this muck.

2080457,1,B0002DRDQE,"Beware of the film that you try to watch more than once only to stop it time after time because it's just not ""doing it"" for you.

On about the fourth go-around of this little ""I want to watch a movie, oh, wait, this movie is crap, nevermind"" game, I decided that I was actually going to sit down and really watch this flick all the way through. Hey, interesting premise, right? Some kid dies, his doting parents bring him back to life through the infant science of cloning, and he starts to get visions of the afterlife once he passes the age at which he died. Not bad. That can be worked with to wonderful results, right? Well, no. You'd THINK that, but you'd be wrong. This movie leaves a LOT to be desired.

Why this? Why would De Niro and Romijn-Stamos and Kinnear--all three of them capable of much more than this trainwreck--agree to perform in such a by-the-numbers thriller with no ending? Their talent is wasted on a horrible, implausible script that in no way mimics the pathos of actual human beings. Why would parents who love and respect their child as much as these people appear to do agree to such a selfish experiment? It doesn't fit. Their decision to clone their dead son comes shockingly easy, while I'd be able to safely say that 99% of people in the same situation would at least wait a few months before saying ""this is creepy and weird; no thanks"".

Add to this the confusing but ultimately boring subplot of De Niro's dead son being somehow mixed into the clone of the dead kid's personality to create a split persona and you've got... well, nothing, really. Nothing at all. Just a muddled mess puked out onto your TV screen.

This movie has no idea what it wants to be. If it was trying to be a poignant argument against cloning, I'm seriously considering reanimating the next dead animal that I see on the side of the road just to spite anyone involved in the making of this film. The ending is the greatest insult of all, as it leaves too many questions unanswered, and unfortunately, can't muster enough energy to make the audience care about those questions in the first place.",1115164800,,2108,4.496083550913838
2080458,4,B0002DRDQE,"First of all; I was very curious on ""Godsend"" because of all the negative response here on Amazon.com, and from various reviews in the newspapers. Was it really so bad? An unworthy thriller-experience? Was the acting really that horrible? De Niro and Kinnear in their worst work ever?

Let me say -the direction by Hamm is superb, he has done the very best with what he had to work with! The story however, well, ""Godsend"" is not The Sixth Sence -it's not original, the material is rather ""used"" - yes - but this could have been a lot worse. I can understand that people/the audience expected more from these famous and brilliant actors (and the director), but seriously; ""Godsend"" has a certain style -and I can't imagine why reviewers describe it as ""the worst movie ever...blablabla!""! If not a masterpiece, highly entertaining!

The female actress, supposively ""so terrible"" -well, I was actually waiting for all that terrible acting to happen, from all the actors! What is so wrong here? The ""parents"" are believable indeed, Kinnear is good in his ""father""-part. De Niro is doing his job too -though perhaps no big role, his worst? I don't think so. Back to the female actress, perhaps no Academy-worthy acting here -but anything but embarrassing!

""Godsend"" does not set out to be anything else than what you get, ""all"" trailers are mostly ""better"" than their movies outcome -especially those from thrillers. The ending, not the most remembarable -but because it is an ""open"" ending. What do you believe happened with the family? These movies requires some imagination from the viewer also!

The picture-quality is superb, the sound too. If you have a capable system see it in dts.

A movie for my collection, I will watch ""Godsend"" again! An underrated thriller with style, not the scariest, but watch it on a rainy night (like I did) and it might just have some ""effect"" on you.

2080464,1,B0002DRDQE,"... and he did... and they still messed it up badly.

I was hoping for a little cult horror item that missed the masses. Instead I got stung by my own dreams. Imagine getting Kinnear and DeNiro together and yet making the most of it as if you had just invited your neighbours kids to act in your movie.

The plot is something you will want to know before you even attempt at second guessing this contraption calling itself a movie. It is not a film at all. Two parents loose a child, a doctor turns up to offer them cloning reproduction, their child grows up and starts to remember dreams that are not his. So the parents go after the doctor and after 70 minutes we find out that doc put some of his dead killer child's memories in the clone, the dad fights with the doctor over this, they both survive and then they move away from one another. THE END.

And that is it in a nutshell and believe me it doesn't even get as deep as what you have just read. The bare scheme is introduced JUST LIKE THAT at a snails pace. The music is used to make you feel scared, that the clone is going to do a CHUCKY or something, but to be honest you just don't care in the least because it does not even work like a film.

ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..........

Terrible production all round with one or two quick MTV ghosty shot like a PG version of 13 Ghosts. Editing is deranged. Camera does nothing most of the time. Lighting not there. Story out the window and replaced by something found in a cornflakes pack.",1107043200,2,1496,4.27208480565371

I didn't bother seeing this one at the theater, but thought I'd give it a whirl in the ol' DVD Machine.  To be perfectly honest, it wasn't ENTIRELY terrible; just mostly terrible.  There were a few ""jumper"" moments that surprised me, plus there's about 10-15 minutes of quality footage towards the end.  The acting, however, is downright horrible.  I don't know if Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos were bad actors or bad parents.  Kinnear especially seemed to go from overly affectionate father one minute to yelling, accusatory, borderline violent father the next over seemingly minor infractions from Adam II (the cloned one).  DeNiro may have turned in the worst performance of his life, which is saying quite a bit considering that he's made a lot of crap over the last few years.  The ideas presented in the movie about cloning and its effects, both morally and physically, aren't really explored to the extent that I would have found satisfying.  Overall, the movie is far from great, but if there's nothing else on, it's worth 102 minutes of your life.  Just don't expect too much.",1103500800,2,1200,4.925373134328358

 I bought this film with a genuine ""cheap"" price, but I think I wasted my money regardless. The scientific and moral issues the film discussed were not in place as the film failed to prove and make a stand to convince the viewer.

2080468,2,B0002DRDQE,"If you do not like the ending of ""Godsend"" do not worry, there are a whole bunch of other alternate endings for you not to like as well on the DVD.  It is not surprising that director Nick Hamm had trouble figuring out what ending he wanted for this 2004 film because Mark Bomback's story cannot decide what this movie is really about.  Given that the premise for this movie is the grief of parents who have lost their only children such indecisiveness is as troubling as it is confusing.

The day after his 8th birthday Adam Duncan (Cameron Bright) is killed in an accident.  His distraught parents are approached by Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro), who was one of the college professors of Jessie Duncan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who works out of her home as a photographer.  Wells does ground breaking rsearch in genetics and he wants to create a clone of Adam.  Paul Duncan (Greg Kinnear), a popular high school biology teacher, is initially resistant but his wife's grief and his own pain lead him to relent.  The Duncans move to Vermont where Wells has his private research facility.  Adam's cloned embryo is implanted in Jessie and she gives birth to a baby boy.

The story then jumps ahead to the 8th birthday of this Adam, who is apparently quite similar to his predecessor except for a different haircut (which is important because it allows us to distinguish between the two version of Adam).  One of the problems with cloning to replace a child or a pet that has died is that even if the clone looks the same, it will not be the same on the inside.  Certainly Adam's mommy and daddy are more protective the second time around, the kid now lives in a rural area rather than the inner city, and the last eight years have certainly been quite different from the previous eight.  I can remember trying to explain to my students that the world is different when a young president is killed but an older president survives an assassination attempt, and the decades of the 1960s and the 1980s would certainly bear that out.

But it is important for the story that Adam be essentially the same because when makes it to two days past his 8th birthday he has now lived longer than his predecessor.  That is when strange things start to happen.  That is because ""Godsend"" is one of those films that reduces the most complex types of science to mumbo-jumbo so that it is suddenly plausible that once the clone gets past the point where the original Adam died that things could go horribly wrong.  Adam is haunted by nightmares and visions, takes to calling the boy who ""lives inside"" him Zachary, and now we are in the familiar film territory of the demon child.

But then it turns out there is another ""scientific"" explanation for why Adam seems to be having memories of his previous existence, and suddenly I am wondering if I have flipped channels and ended up in another movie.  Since I am watching ""Godsend"" on DVD, this proves not to be the case, but this movie just goes jumping off the deep end while it revisits most of the clichs involving demon children, mad scientists, and dark places.  There is a point where Kinnear's character finds out what is really going on and is deeply offended at how he has been exploited, which is exactly how many viewers will feel when they watch ""Godsend.""  This film is technically competent, but reveals itself to be emotionally hollow and intellectually suspect.

I checked this movie out because I had just seen young Cameron Bright in ""Birth"" and I am always looking for a good horror thriller.  ""Godsend"" is not even close to being that movie.  Kinnear's performance is the most heartfelt in the film, but it is not like the script gives any of the characters anything substantial to do and provides De Niro with the worst piece of drivel he has ever had to say on screen.  Bright knows how to look eerie, but I already knew that going in, which is also true about Romijn-Stamos's looks.  By the time I got to all those alternate endings (whose ample evidence of indecisiveness led me to drop another star from the film's final rating) I was totally convinced that what ""Godsend"" really needed to do was end at the point where the second Adam was older than the first and tell the human drama of a family trying to recreate what had been lost, instead of this botched horror thriller.",1101081600,6,4336,4.585492227979275
2080469,1,B0002DRDQE,"""Godsend"" was a film that had great potential. The concept of cloning another human is an intriguing and frightening premise. Director Nick Hamm is revered as one of Britain's foremost authorities in theatrical direction, though ""Godsend"" marked his first major venture in filmmaking. The casting of Robert De Niro as the enigmatic Dr. Richard Wells seemed like a superb call.

As it turns out, ""Godsend"" is one of the most pathetic excuses in horror ever to stain celluloid.

Ever desperate for cheap thrills, ""Godsend,"" contrary to its title, is a hastily produced picture sent via the moviemaking underworld.

The film impatiently attempts to duplicate the creepy success of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense,"" only to find itself laughably arduous. The sights and sounds that unfolded around Haley Joel Osment's character in ""The Sixth Sense"" genuinely were disturbing.

In ""Godsend,"" witnessing gangrenous arms poke out of the shadows is about the only slightly bothersome imagery. (Which makes no sense because it never is explained. Is it purely for shameful kicks?) I don't understand why this film was given a PG-13 rating. The jackals in ""The Lion King"" were creepier than anything in this movie. I have grade-school cousins who wouldn't twitch a muscle in fright.

As a matter of fact, ""Godsend"" is so rancidly trite and clichd that it makes Brian DePalma appear wholly original in his directorial endeavors. Thankfully, I was flanked by an immensely attractive woman to my left, or else I might have left the theater pondering, ""If there is a God, why does he let such cinematic filth exist?"" or ""My God, I just aimlessly discarded two hours of my life.""

It's true when I say I am not your typical alpha male that feels he must suppress his inner fears and portray John Wayne-esque machismo when viewing a scary movie. Instead, I try to set myself up to be terrified witless. Time and time again, I erected the dominoes to scaredom during ""Godsend"" only to be disappointed when the knock-over effect came to a halt midway. I left more dejected than when Mark Mangino realized that his ploy to kidnap Philip Rivers prior to the Tangerine Bowl match-up pitting his Jayhawks against the North Carolina State Wolfpack was thwarted.

The following are my concluding thoughts. Nick Hamm: You ought to be ashamed. Lion's Gate Films: You ought to be ashamed. Robert De Niro: You ought to be ashamed. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos: You're beautiful, but you, too, ought to be ashamed.",1100476800,,2484,4.9855072463768115
2080470,1,B0002DRDQE,"This movie is strangely anti-science.  Here's the plot:

The disturbed man then clones someone else dead child but instead of actually cloning the child like he promised, he inserts his son's genes in the mix because he misses his disturbed son.

The result is another disturbed son that likes to hit people over the head with heavy objects.

That's the story.  When did this bubble up to the top of good ideas to spend millions of dollars on?

Throughout the movie, the question of whether cloning is moral or not is asked.  For some reason, the fact that the disturbed cloning man committed fraud is underplayed, and cloning gets all the focus as if it is was the root of all of the problems.  That's like blaming 9/11 on air travel.",1099180800,8,946,4.416184971098266
2080471,1,B0002DRDQE,"Well well well, where do I begin.  The premise of the movie is fantastic.  The actors chosen for this movie was amazing, I'm talking oscar winning (I don't know, are they?) actors here, DeNiro, Kinnear and c'mon eye candy, Rebecca Romijn.  Wow, how did the directors con these actors into signing up for this movie.  As I was saying, the premise and the potential of this movie were without bounds, yet somehow, it was ruined along the way.  The reviews below pretty much sum up all I am thinking right now.

To add to them.  There were four alternate endings on the DVD.  Each equally horrific.  Each outdoing the next in utter sickness.  It seems that there are two parts to the endings, and the director played pick and choose and made four alternate combinations of endings.  One ending was excellent (ending 3), yet just when I thought I had closure, the director decided to screw that one up as well in the following scene.

All I can say is this.  I am gonna do my best and save some poor innocent soul from watching movie.  I am taking a hit, and am currently microwaving the Blockbuster rented DVD right now.

Perhaps Mr. DeNiro loves dogs, in which case his presence in this one would be justified. Ow, well, he is a great actor and I will not execute him for what he did.

His performance was lame, though, weak and superficial. Not all of it his fault, because the script did not leave room for more. Hey, the script? The story? I bet not even the writer made any sense out of it. It was dismal and incoherent. Scary? Yeah, right.

And Rebecca, my God, she over acted, over screeched and made a mess of it. And the rest of the cast did whatever they could. Most of it bad. Let's blame the director.

In order to scare us, in this one they copy those hanging chains from ""Alien,"" but forgot the slime and the creature. Never mind. In this dog they have an old shack of some kind and there are chains and from the chains an ax hangs, ominously. Oh boy, what a thrill! They forgot to step on some poor cat's tail and have the lilttle critter jumping across the screen hissing and spitting. Lacking in horror, what did they give us? Noise. Yes!

Second: The ending was great! I had the first couple of twists figured out, but I was not sure how they would end it. That having been said, the ending left me with an uneasy feeling (which is a good thing- this is a horror movie afterall).

I think the real reason people haven't taken to this flick is that it contains actors whom you would normally never see in this type of film. I guess they were expecting ""Goodfellas"" or ""As good as it gets.""

Godsend is not brilliant, and a couple parts were a bit on the cheezy side of substance. But it did succeed in summoning the scares, thanks to the kid.

He was freaky! I was going to head downstairs at 2 A.M. to make a chuleta y nopales sandwich, but that image of the damn kid kept me under the covers, snuggled up against my wife, afraid to wade through the darkness.

The movie was decent, the director had a great idea with the script, along with a great cast, and I enjoyed the movie up until the last 10 minutes or so.  The ending really brought this movie down.

Now, the movie overall delivers in some areas and falls short in others.  The concept of cloning humans is front page news these days, so the topic is an up-to-date issue that makes the movie very interesting.  What this movie lacks is a clear understanding of the ending.  I don't want to give the ending away, so I'll just say it can be very disappointing - De Niro's character is very vague about the cloning procedure and how his own addition to the DNA (from a source I shan't name) caused a disruption in Adam's personality.

I agree with most reviews - it could have been a little better.  But I think it was kinda scary.

I found myself wondering how the actors felt having given very solid performances, only to see the finished product in preview?  The story just dropped and left you feeling like you'd wasted two hours.  The child's part was poorly developed, as were the clues or storyline leading up to the end.  Perhaps that's why they couldn't find a fitting ending.  The movie lacked good flow.  The father and mother's roles should have somehow been opposite, until the end.  It just didn't work.

Where was the plot?  Where was the screenwriter?  Where was the editor?  Someone needed to guide this film.  No one did.  As a result, it fell flat.",1094256000,,776,4.651851851851852
2080487,2,B0002DRDQE,"If you like evil kid movies this one may appeal to your senses but if you are looking for something that induces nightmares this film falls far short.

This movie is basic at best and the storyline is entirely predictable. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos does a good job playing the over-protective and freaked out mother of the evil child, played unconvincingly by Cameron Bright. Completing the perfect family is Greg Kinnear who is the ever suspicious father in this modern nuclear family on the verge of destruction. Both parents spend the entire film speculating on what is happening to the child they created with a mad scientist, played brilliantly by Robert DeNiro. After losing their real son Stamos and Kinnear encounter DeNiro at their child's funeral and seem to happily go along with an illegal fertility procedure to clone the dead child. The story just seems very far fetched to me. First of all if a doctor is doing illegal procedures why is he stalking every funeral in town searching for candidates, isn't that a little too risky? Also why would parents who find themselves confronted with their child holding an axe just accept him as one of their own as soon as he says, ""It's me Daddy!"" Maybe this film is best left unquestioned.

The best part of this DVD is the alternative endings with five or six different outcomes some are actually better than the ending of the film itself. But the scariest part of this movie is the sound! Most of the film is spent with the characters whispering their lines so that you find yourself turning up the volume only to have every picture on your wall vibrating when the so-called scary parts need added effect, the sound is much more terrifying than the scene. I was hoping for more of a psychological thriller with emphasis placed on the rights and wrongs of cloning human beings instead this film just warns you about making rash decisions after a funeral. Maybe we should just leave the decisions up to God and make another choice in a movie.",1093824000,,1993,4.724137931034483
2080488,3,B0002DRDQE,"Someone once said that the art that reflects society's fears and concerns on a subconscious level make the best horror. I tend to agree with this outlook. By experimenting with society's fears of genetic cloning and stem cell research, combined with Greg Kinnear's exceptional acting abilities, ""Godsend"" comes extremely close to being as good a movie as something along the lines of ""Sixth Sense."" Unfortunately, a few flaws that initially seemed minor make the movie fail, although not completely, as a plausible and rewarding experience. Even with Robert Deniro playing a cold, emotionless scientist, who scientifically experiments with nature without any regard for how his manipulations will effect those around him (reflecting societies prejudice and fears against the sterile, objective environment of the scientific community), he is suprisingly too one-dimensional, and doesn't give his character enough depth to make the viewer care one way or another about him. Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Stamos convincingly play two caring and doting parents, and the child who played their son did a great job of coming off as creepy and sadistic with his multiple personality complex. Yet, the plot is hardly believable, and there were many parts of the movie concerning the scientific premise from which the boy's affliction stemmed from that I had a difficult time suspending my disbelief for. Still, I found myself guessing throughout most of the movie, and found it nail bitingly suspenseful, although the attempt to explain the reasons for the boy's split personality as a natural cause determined through a genetic experiment was unsatisfactory, unconvincing, and disappointing as coming from a realistic point of view and I wish they would have replaced it with an unrealistic, but more entertaining supernatural cause.

Attesting to the fact that the movie had 5 endings filmed (and you get the alternate 4 on the special features), one can only surmise that Hamm wasn't sure what to do with his movie.  How should it end?  Should the child be hated or simply pitied?  What about the parents?  Are they morally to blame?  And of course, the dear old scientist...how much is he responsible?

Greg Kinnear has proven over the past few years the versatility he is capable of showing (We Are Soldiers, Nurse Betty, As Good As It Gets).  His performance is commendable, considering the script.  Robert DeNiro's presence elevates a role that is so derivative and predictable, it's pitiful.  However, there are flashes of brilliance in DeNiro's performance.  Cameron Bright as little Adam is effectively eerie (he did well too in BUTTERFLY EFFECT as the evil little boy).  The main problem seems to lie in Rebecca Stamos' performance---it's too staged and unfocused.  She is merely an actress going through the motions.  Had someone with powerful presence like Laura Linney or Marcia Gay Harden had the role, it could've swayed the development.

Grief stricken, they are approached by super-scientist Robert DeNiro who can clone their child.  Oh, but Dr. DeNiro has some secrets and another agenda.  When the child reaches his eighth birthday he starts having `terror spells', which basically reveal the entire plot through scrappy, cut and paste flashbacks.

But the director Nick Hamm is so confused by the story of human cloning and its possible dramatic events that he ends up offering on the DVD four alternative endings to this wandering mess of a film. Each of the alternative endings would have been preferable to the one chosen: the grit of the conflict is actually addressed in them instead of left hanging in the ennui of good vs. evil of the story.

2080502,3,B0002DRDQE,"`Godsend' is a minor league effort borrowing a few of superstar actor Robert DeNiro's talents to give some cachet of quality to this moderately scary but intellectually unsatisfying thriller / horror movie. All one has to do is to compare this movie to greats in the genre with children as central characters such as the original `The Exorcist' and `The Shining' to see how short this movie falls from those successful scarefests.

I believe the problem is that the concept begins with a really interesting, but somewhat half-baked idea about creating an exact copy of a child killed in an accident through cloning, since the mother cannot conceive, but she can carry a fetus to a successful birth in her womb, and, of course, she doesn't want another child, she wants her own lost `Adam'. Aside from the fact that the story sticks with current political atmosphere and holds that this procedure is illegal, there is not much in the concept so far to make it thrilling or horrific. At least, the writer, director, and producer were not willing to turn this into something interesting without additional tinkering with the concept. So, they added the new twist of a hidden agenda carried out by the doctor / scientist of `Godsend' corporation, our own Bobbie DeNiro, who solicits the parents to do the cloning.

As the story revolves around the development of the cloned 8-year-old son, the weakness in the child actor for this character is one of the most evident lapses in the movie. Like the little boy in `The Shining', Adam has what seems to be an imaginary friend, cleverly named Zachary (note the juxtaposition of first letters of their names). Yet this device is very weakly implemented. Just watch the scenes in `The Shining' where `Captain Howdy' appears and the difference in dramatic impact is palpable. The child actor, Cameron Bright will probably not win any appearances on the Ellen DeGeneres show for this performance.

The dialogue, acting, and direction of the characters of the parents are wooden and predictable. Again, just compare the sympathy you feel for the mothers in `The Exorcist' and `The Shining' and you can see the difference immediately.

The biggest problem I felt with the movie is that it was never completely clear if the little boy clone was perp or victim to the supernatural forces driving his actions in the last third of the movie. I will not give away the final explanation in the event you look forward to watching the movie, but my overall feeling is that in spite of some scary moments depending more on clever camera work and editing a la `Psycho' shower scene than on real mounting suspense, this movie simply does not work.

As an aside, I wondered how the Godsend Corporation for which DeNiro worked could explain its name, based on something the movie admits as being totally illegal. One review of this DVD in my local paper says that this movie proves that DeNiro will do anything for money. I actually don't begrudge DeNiro his dinaro from this flick. I simply won't be a part to encouraging people to see it.

Also, as a student of book and movie blurbs, I discover on this cover a new source, reviews in `Netflix'. I don't know if these are `professional' reviewers or shleppers like us on Amazon.com, but this broadens the ability of a movie or book distributor to find someone to say something nice about a work. I will venture a guess that this opens the possibility for a person with a connection with the distribution of the work to get into these venues and praise the work to high heaven.

Cloning and genetic manipulation are the tools of Satan in this particular fantasy about a child brought back from the dead, so to speak, thanks to the research ""genius"" Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro).

He offers his illegal services to Paul and Jessie Duncan (Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), young parents newly devastated by the accidental death of their 8-year-old son.

Paul is reluctant, but Jessie is desperate to have her boy back, so they agree to sever ties with home and settle near Wells' remote clinic. A cloned embryo leads to a healthy baby who grows up normally until he turns 8.

That's when he starts having terrible nightmares and hallucinations. He seems to snap in and out of consciousness, as if possessed by a split personality.

Once the spooky visions are in play, the plot starts twisting this way and that without ever coming up with any meaningful surprises. Nasty business comes to light - speaking metaphorically only. So much of the movie takes place in deep shadows it sometimes seems the family lives in a house without electricity.

Kinnear and Romijn-Stamos both give solid, convincing performances, and Cameron Bright as the troubled child, is exceptionally effective. De Niro, on the other hand, seems to be operating on cruise control.

Director Nick Hamm, a British TV and stage veteran, shows a nice appreciation for horror-movie conventions, which is both good and bad news.

2080517,2,B0002DRDQE,"Like many of the other reviewers, my expectations for this film were high, given that the subject matter was quite promising. I have to say that the film does not live up to the expectations.
WARNING: POTENTIAL SPOILERS
There are quite a few parts to the film that are interesting - mostly those that deal with Adam's nightmares. However, most of those nightmares never seem to tie in with the story. For example, why was Adam/Zachary shouting at the window, in the first dream? Second, we know that Zachary wasn't drowned in the tub by the housekeeper. Why was the hand that grabbed Adam all veiny and blue (like the hand of a drowning victim)? Third, why does Zachary's appearance coincide with the date of Adam's death? And fourth, the whole incident with Adam being dragged into the closet was a bit too real - since dreams don't open doors and drag victims into closets. What exactly was that about? These are a few of the many plot holes you have to ignore to actually like the film.
END OF SPOILERS
While interesting in concept, this film is very poorly put together. The story lacks any sort of cohesiveness, a lot of the story elements are never explained, and the ending does not improve the situation any. If this was a pre-planned two-part film, I would be expecting a lot of explanation wrt to background in the second half. With the ending as it is now, I wouldn't be surprised if this film turned into a 21st century ""Child's Play"" - with 15 sequels, each worse than the next.",1084147200,3,1491,4.5464684014869885
2080518,5,B0002DRDQE,"There wasn't too much hype over this movie, I was truly look forward to seeing it and after I did I thought it was truly amazing and orriginal, Greg Kinnear did a surperb performance. Very orriginal idea, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat with kean interest. Very orriginal, in my book it surpasses the hype and performance of The Ring, deffinately a must see and must buy, 5 stars.",1083974400,,390,4.3561643835616435
2080519,1,B0002DRDQE,"I thought ""Godsend"" was going to be a science fiction thriller along the lines of Gattacca. I thought it might even be sort of a hybrid of ""Gatticca"" and ""A.I."" The ""Gattacca"" angle would deal with the ethical issues surrounding the manipulation of genetics to suit our own desires. The ""A.I."" angle would come into play because the couple is trying to REPLACE their dead son. This issue was explored far too briefly in ""A.I."" partly because the son was able to come back to life. Plus, ""A.I."" had many more issues to tackle because the child was non-human: the hazards of unconditional love, what we as humans owe to what we create, issues of man vs. machine, obseletism, etc. etc. etc. ""Godsend"" on the other hand deals only with humans, and some interesting issues are raised but never resolved, in favor of being just another evil child horror film. The first of these intriguing issues is one that has been raised countless times, which has a larger role in determining who we are, nature or nurture? The second is the far-fetched but no less interesting concept of cellular memory. The third question raised is what would happen if the replacement discovered he was only a replacement? Adam, (the clone) stumbles upon pictures of the other Adam but the need to explain the photos is forgotten as the clone once again succumbs to homicidal urges. The issue of destiny is also explored briefly, (the new Adam has many close calls with automobiles, the instrument of the previous Adam's demise.)
  OK, I know some of you are saying, ""Once you found out it was a horror film why didn't you just stay home? It's not the film's fault it wasn't what you wanted."" To that I say, if it had to be horror, is it too much to ask that it be good horror? The film is purely a collection of scenes designed to make you jump, and I have to say that most of them accomplished that goal. Yet, I have cerebral palsy, which means along with many other nasty things, nature has cursed me with a hair-trigger startle reflex, and even with that working in the film's favor some of the ""startle scenes"" failed to hit their mark. This alone is testament to the film's gross inadequacy. And lets not forget the horrible writing and acting. If I had parents that said those cutesy-poo things to me, I would have thrown myself in front of that car on purpose. There was once a time when I would have asked, ""what's DeNiro doing here?"" but by now he should feel right at home.
  The only thing Godsent about ""Godsend"" is the ending, by which I mean it has one.",1083974400,18,2537,4.5206971677559915
2080520,1,B0002DRDQE,"This movie used all the standard ""scary"" situations - house by the lake, something in the bathtub, chase through the woods, someone hearing someone approaching them in the woods, but can't see them (even though the trees are so thin and spaced so far apart there is nowhere to hide during daylight). Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is a horrible actor - she hasn't been in a good movie yet, I decided to give this movie a chance since Robert De Niro is in it, but he couldn't save this movie. It has a weak story line and the ""investigation of the mystery"" is way too fast and easy. This movie makes ""Gothica"" look like the best horror movie ever made.",1083801600,17,642,4.4491525423728815
2080521,1,B0002DRDQE,Me and two of my friends went to see this movie.  We were very excited because the commericals made it seem so exciting.  If you are reading this please take my advice and don't ever ever see this movie.  It's horrible.  It has no action.  No romance.  A little mystery and barely a plot.  It only gets midly interesting at the end for like 2 minutes.  The movie is not worth the money.  In the end of the movie people in the movie theather were literally hoping that it would end and cheering when it did. If you're anything like me(age 17 male don't do it.) Take my advice and don't forsake yourself. If you want to see a good action movie go and see The Punisher.,1083715200,3,666,4.181102362204724
2080522,1,B0002DRDQE,"I have never been one to write such a bad review of a movie, but I feel compelled to warn others away from this one. It was just plain terrible. I figured with the big name actors involved, it would have to be halfway decent at the least.  Boy, was I wrong.

2080523,1,B0002DRDQE,"Talk about your false advertisment! This film is in NO WAY a Godsend. It is a train wreck waiting to happen. And the sharp robotic movements need to stop!
 Do not think for one second that just because Robert De Niro stars in this horrid Sci-fi thriller, that it's the bee's knees. In fact, don't even think about this trashy film at all. Playing the mad scientist in this dopey piece of schlock about some cloning crap I could care less about, De Niro mostly sleep walks through the role, leaving the heavy emotions to his unlucky co-stars.
 The plot of Godsend seems lifted from one of those trashy, cheap horror paperbacks you'd buy in the airport to kill time on a layover-and then leave on the plane! The movie begins with a biology teacher (Greg Kinnear) bringing his son a gift. The mom (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos) takes her talkative, hyper, and downright annoying son, Adam (Some kid, probably another Culkin) out to do some Mother-Son shopping. This film has many inconsistences abound as Stamos looks more like Adam's yappy babysitter than his mother and Stamos looks practically like jailbait standing next to Kinnear!
  ANYWAYZ
 The brat is killed off in a freak accident and this is when the film's pacing comes to a screeching HALT! Enter Dr. Richard Wells (The best actor in the world, Mr. Robert De Niro) who tells the young couple how he can give them back their son in a new procedure. The mom is all too ready to jump in, while pop is indifferent.
 When 'Adam 2' is born, he is the mirror image of the first Adam (complete with that annoying, whiny voice).'Adam' reaches his eighth birthday and begins to act crazy and have night terrors. This is when the film gets too absurd for anyone with an IQ higher than 60. Cheap scares, irrelvance, fuzzy logic. This is when you should turn off the film.
 It really hurts to know that De Niro actually signed up for this rubbish. You would think that with all those other great films under his belt (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Cape Fear), he would pass on this trash. One can tell the producers had to pay De Niro a large sum of cash to appear in this crap, and it shows! This movie has the worst special effects that look straight out the 1980's!
 The two parents are helpless ( in acting skills as well) as thier rebellious, angst-driven 'son' runs amock spitting in teacher's faces, throwing temper tantrums, screaming, smoking, setting fires, exploding microwaves, swearing, and even offing fellow schoolmates.
 Kinnear seems to be confused in his role. He doesn't know if he wants to be the Seventh Heaven father or Al Pacino. He breaks character beyond excuse and is unintentionally funny whenever he says ""Adam?"" or when he's rambling on about stupid stuff. The only time Kinnear tries his hardest not to break character is in the film's laughable climax when he confronts De Niro. De Niro, on the other hand looks like he's about to laugh his head off through the entire scene!
  Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is the weak link in the acting chain of this film. Her role is basically reduced to screaming ""Adam!"" in every scene or crying her eyes out to the point that it gets annoying with her Dana Scully haircut. She is given little to do except walk around an old Victorian house with an early '90's cordless telophone in one hand and a Michael Myers kitchen knife in the other.
 As far as the musical score goes.............bah! You've heard better pieces from your uncle who always sings in the shower. The musician of this film decided that banging random notes on a keyboard was good music. Some of the pieces sound like they've went through your mother's old Hoover vacuum cleaner. One piece sounds like a slower and more subdued version of Michael Jack's ""Thriller""! Well, horrible movies should have horrible music to accompany it.
 This film left the viewer with more questions than answers. Not one question was answered after the mediocre ending. Who and what are Watchers, and why has one of them gone beserk? What ever happened to Dr. Richard Wells? How exactly had Wells gotten Zachary's DNA if Zachary had been burned to a crisp? Did they even suspect that Adam killed that boy? Why did Adam wanna bump off his mom?  And finally, who and what exactly is Adam at the end of this stupid film?
  What a mess this film is! This movie is the equilvalent to a forty car pile-up that happens right on I-95! A pretty dumb plot, bad acting on almost all of the actors, and stupidness. The film suffers most when the lead actors are walking around on the screen together. De Niro looks wooden and stiff, Kinnear looks like he forgot his lines, Stamos looks like she has a bad hangover, and the brat seems a little too interested. The actors are a little fine alone, but Kinnear and Stamos lack chemistry and leaves the viewer with a bad taste in their mouth. De Niro and Kinnear look like this is all a joke.  Why is the brat always hyper?! Stop that! I wasted a good one hundred some odd minutes that I can never get back on this 'movie' just to see actors who look like they've been abducted by aliens and then sent back to Earth trying to remember the last past two hours. And the refrences to other films needs to stop! This film took from Sixth Sense, The Exorcist, and a little undertones of The Shining. Neither of which can save the movie (just like Mr. De Niro). With dumb characters, dumb acting, and '80's grade special effects, it's a wonder why this film wasn't released on a 'straight-to-video' basis. Who's gonna clean up this mess? Not me! Shame on all y'all for making this Omen-wannabe, overwrought update to The Bad Seed!",1083542400,9,5604,4.599198396793587
2080524,4,B0002DRDQE,"For some reason this film reminds me of The Other. I mean it's not to scary, but it is entertaining. It's not terrible, I mean please people, you wanna see bad see Manos, The Hands of Fate. This is a 3.5 star movie. A little predictable, and the loud noises and jumps don't work, well on me at least, the psychological part of the film is what impressed me. The three actors have an easy and very believable family chemistry. Then there's the undeniable fact that there's just something about kids-gone-wrong in horror movies that works. Think back to The Bad Seed, to The Village of the Damned, to The Exorcist, to The Omen, to The Good Son, to The Sixth Sense, to The Others, to The Ring. While Adam may not become as iconic as Rhoda or Damien, Bright does an excellent job with the subtle shifts in character, and he never lays it on too thick. One should see and old forgotten gem from 1972 called The Other. A much superior film, and strangely enough, I found this film to be similar, but not as good or as scary as The Other. I say see it. It's worth a matinee.",1083542400,5,1067,4.287128712871287
2080525,1,B0002DRDQE,"Why is it that I always get suckered into seeing a Lions Gate film? It seems like Lions Gate only releases movies that are so bad that no one else would. There may be a few exceptions, but Lions Gate movies suck and I have done my research.
  Same goes for this gumble of a movie. I can't believe that De Niro even got involved with this. Granted he's done some really bad movies, especially Analyze That (but its still clear why he'd want to do it). This movie is corny when it's supposed to be emotional and its boring when its supposed to be creepy. There is no resolution and it really should have since there the only thing that could have saved this movie would have been an interesting resolution.
  The idea of the movie is interesting, but appantently they got a C average seventh grader to write it and a group of monkeys to make it instead of competent film makers. You might want to see it because of it's good cast, but trust me that is just gild.",1083369600,7,960,4.258241758241758
