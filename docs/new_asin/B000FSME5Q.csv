2584347,5,B000FSME5Q,It's always such a great day when a lost movie of the Silent Era is found. In Gloria Swanson's autobiography she stated that one day she hoped this movie would be found for people to enjoy. A dream now comes true. Gloria's Wedding dress is so beautiful in the wedding scene. Such a beautiful film. True Gloria Swanson and Valentino fans will love this film.,1151366400,7,357,4.507692307692308
2584348,2,B000FSME5Q,"Gee, only two of twenty readers found my pre-release review of this less-than-thrilling film helpful? I guess you prefer the deep analyses of other reviewers, like, ""Gloria's wedding dress is so beautiful in the wedding scene"" in guiding your buying decisions? Okay, here's something nice to say about ""Beyond The Rocks"": it will put you to sleep faster than barbiturates and will definitely not become habit-forming! I stand by all my original comments as follows:

Having just viewed the U.S. television premiere of ""Beyond The Rocks,"" I could not have been more disappointed. It richly deserves the reviews it garnered at the time of its release, which ran along the lines of, ""The stars wear clothes beautifully"" (new drinking game: down a shot for every one of Swanson's costume changes! You'll enjoy the film more, believe me). The trite story of woman-trapped-in-wealthy-but-loveless-marriage, such as it is, unfolds in a painfully slow and turgid fashion. Valentino (who never looked more beautiful), in particular, is wasted in a nothing role. Swanson is very badly made-up and photographed, with a hairdo that resembles a black plastic helmet; never was this gorgeous woman shown to worse advantage. Sam Wood was a boring studio hack in the 20s, as he was right through the sound era, and there are no directorial flourishes to save the film. For true film buffs or Valentino/Swanson fans only. Hopefully, the nearly-complete restoration of the previously-lost Valentino flop ""The Young Rajah,"" which was also shown on TCM, will make its way to DVD, as it was much more interesting on several levels.",1148947200,10,1610,5.145038167938932
2584349,5,B000FSME5Q,"This film was featured at last year's silent film festival here at the Castro Theater in San Francisco following its discovery in 2002 in a Dutch film archive.  What a treat!  The restoration has been painstaking and beautifully done, and the new orchestral score is a work of art all by itself.

Paramount rarely paired its biggest stars, figuring each of them could tentpole a major feature all by themselves, and so usually a star like Valentino or Swanson would play opposite an up and comer, often of markedly inferior star status.  Here is the glorious exception and yes, each of them brings out the very best in the other, though due to a curious trick of plot construction a third actor, Robert Bolder, gets to play the most affecting scenes.  Theodora FitzGerald, a lovely, poor English lass, has lost her heart to the nobleman who rescues her from drowning one afternoon--he is Lord Hector Bracondale, who at first seems to go away and never think of her again, while she pines for him.  Her two hectoring sisters urge her to marry a fat older man of the lower classes who has gone all nouveau riche and become a multi-millionaire, one of the richest principals in England.  The two sisters say she owes it to her father--and the subtitles tell us that for Theodora, love of her father ""is her religion.""  Swanson plays Theodora not so much as an English girl but as any girl who finds herself drawn to a man she must not have--Lord Hector, played by Valentino.  No, he doesn't seem especially English either, but his exquisite dancer's bearing and his suave, kind manners give him a radiant, fresh beauty that tingles with hers.  Swanson is absolutely gorgeous in the part, though she's saddled with heavy makeup like Alice Cooper, and a series of haute couture costumes that sometimes make her tiny figure look a bit on the waddling side--so unfair, when she probably weighed about, what, eighty-five pounds?

When Hector and Theodora are together the sparks fairly jump from the screen, and during some reels the ruined film stock looks as though the scenes are literally burning up from frame to frame--I suppose restoration can only go so far.  Valentino's performance here is ungodly.  I thought he was a figure of fun, the male vamp, but BEYOND THE ROCKS reveals a skilled actor who will remind you forcibly of someone like Gary Cooper.  Odd that Sam Wood, the great US director who made BEYOND THE ROCKS, later worked with Cooper repeatedly (CASANOVA BROWN, PRIDE OF THE YANKEES, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, SARATOGA TRUNK) as though reinforcing his patent on this type, the quiet charmer with the steadfast heart and matching courage.

Josiah Brown, the vulgar millionaire whom Swanson marries, repels us at first with his louche displays of crassness, but the picture becomes ever so much more interesting when he develops into a three dimensional character as he finds out his wife has fallen for another man.

The lovers go to Versailles and fancy themselves in flashback as playing lovers of the era of Marie Antoinette.  Has Sofia Coppola seen this picture?  There are also flashbacks to ancient Egypt, just to add to the sense of madness about this movie.  It's as though passion weren't enough--you have to have time travel, too.

As Josiah Brown decides to go on a Sahara expedition, the makeup people really do a number on him.  He's fat anyhow, and in his desert costume he really looks exactly like the late Leigh Bowery, the Australian performance artist who starred in WIGSTOCK and posed for Lucian Freud.  His balding scalp glows in the sun, the mascara on his hooded eyelids runs, his obese stomach shakes with remorse.  It's like Divine playing Camille, and yet, somehow it all works and the movie will have you dissolved into its own recipe for melancholy.  It seems that love always hurts, and to their astonishment, Swanson and Valentino must learn from the one  they thought least likely to show them honest emotion.

PS, I love the one intertitle: ""Ann not only calls on the Browns, she carries them off to Beachleigh, her country place, for Whitsuntide.""  Whitsuntide?  Talk about ultra-British!  It could be a new holiday for anglophile Madonna!",1148860800,11,4184,4.820728291316526

2584351,5,B000FSME5Q,"I love silent pictures and could not resist Valentino and Swanson together. Valentino has a charm all his own and would be as popular to-day as he was then. His acting is excellent and has stood the test of time. Swanson was an ideal leading lady for him. The supporting cast were excellent and, at first, Swanson married a man who seems a buffoon but one comes to like him immensely and one feels quite sad for him at the end of the film. He is a gentleman.  I have only one criticism of the film and that is I wish it had been left in black and white as the sets, make-up, clothes, etc. are made for black and white lighting and filming.  This film was in a ghastly yellow  colour and everyone seemed to be yellow and in yellow clothes.  One sequence was a  blue-tinge black and white scene which was preferable to the yellow.  I don't know whether it's because of the restoration process or if it is some-one's idea that we must see some colour. Movie lovers enjoy black and white as much as colour.

2584353,5,B000FSME5Q,I have seen some excerpt of the movie on You Tube and I can't wait to get the DVD so that I can see the movie in its entirety. I wanted to see this movie since I am a big fan of both Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino. It was wonderful to see those people working together since I had read in the Biography written about Rudolph Valentino by Emily W. Leider that those two people were friends offscreen. It is too bad that that movie was found only after the death of Gloria Swanson since she had pass the remark in her autobiography that she would have liked to see it. The story is wonderful and I am sure that when it came out in the cinemas in the 1920's the public that saw it loved it.,1370995200,,693,4.028985507246377

2584357,5,B000FSME5Q,"I am so pleased that I had the opportunity to see ""Beyond the Rocks"".  My son purchased it for me through Amazon.

I am very much a fan of Rudoloph Valentino.  I've read that he was friendly with Ms. Swanson (they used to go riding together) and this was the only film they were teamed in.  How wonderful it could be saved.

Someone said it was a good idea to leave the train scene in the film (I quite agree) so that you have a better idea of just how nearly we came to never seeing these two silent film giants work together.  Yes, the story was weak, but THEY made it worthwhile to watch.

Also, the ladies in so many silent films are often dressed so frumpy, but not in this film.  Was Valentino's wife involved in designing the costumes?  The ladies in this film (particularly Ms. Swanson) wore some wonderful outfits.",1346112000,2,823,4.326797385620915

2584361,5,B000FSME5Q,"In her autobiography* Gloria Swanson asked : ""Does anybody know of a print anywhere of Beyond the Rocks, the film Rudy Valentino made with me in 1921?"" Lost for decades, this wonderful example of the art of popular silent film culture was discovered in the collection of an eccentric movie-buff in Holland after his death. Beautifully restored by the Nederlands Filmmuseum, apart from some brief scenes where the print was too deteriorated to salvage, the film is a joy from beginning to end. The performances of the two stars and the supporting players are outstanding, Elinor Glyn's racy (for the era) storyline is hugely entertaining and the extras on the DvD are truly remarkable. I watched this movie twice in the first week it arrived. Unreservedly recommended.

2584363,3,B000FSME5Q,"I'm glad this movie was found - glad it was restored - glad to have seen it - but wish I'd enjoyed it more...

Considering I've seen so many silent movies, I was actually surprised to realize this was the first time I'd seen either a Rudolf Valentino OR a Gloria Swanson(silent) movie!  That said, I found Rudolf Valentino good in this, and Gloria Swanson... well... pretty average.  She wasn't terrible - but there are other actresses who were better... prettier... Was even surprised to see she was as stocky as she was.  Not to sound shallow, but I watched the movie wondering ""Why was she a star?""  What drew people to Gloria Swanson, over some of the others?  Studio press?

The movie...  The restoration is very impressive.  There's one particular point in the movie (the shot of the train), where the film looks like it's disintegrating right before your eyes.  Glad they kept this footage in (it only lasts a few seconds, so don't get alarmed), as it makes you realize just how fragile silent movies are.  The contrast is crisp - the footage clear.  Costumes are great.  A lot of the acting is also very good.  Gertrude Astor (played Morella) was wonderful, I thought.  She was so good - in a minor role - that I looked her up on imdb.com to see what else she'd done.  (I was amazed that she'd appeared in over 200 movies - with almost ALL of them appearing as ""UNCREDITED"".)  I was sure she must've turned in some powerhouse performance somewhere along the way...

The soundtrack...  Glad an alternate soundtrack is included (one without the sound effects).  The sound effects bothered me alot - but did not bother my partner at all.  (In fact, he said he enjoyed the effects.)  Problem with this (for me, anyway) is that - even though I'd rather see the movie without the effects - I don't think I want to sit through this movie a second time, to even hear the alternate soundtrack.

Other pluses:  Two other actors - Alec Francis & Robert Bolder - turn in nice performances.  Bolder, especially, making a potentially laughable ending a touching one, instead.

So... When is THE BIG PARADE ever coming out on DVD????????",1170028800,9,2130,4.613333333333333
2584364,5,B000FSME5Q,"It isn't everyday that a silent movie with two wildly popular stars is found. What is even more exciting is that the movie is actually good, and that its DVD release is excellent.

Beyond the Rocks is a moody melodrama about a poor girl named Theodora (Gloria Swanson) who marries for money and position but truly loves another man (Rudolph Valentino). The two eventually reunite and carry on a love affair that seems destined for trouble. The story is trite and typical of writer Elinor Glyn, but the actors carry it well and there are enough exciting locations and small incidents to captivate an audience. The soundtrack is not perfect, and since the one with many sound effects annoyed many people, there is an option to see the film without them. However, the music provides a distinctive mood for the film. It is almost haunting, an appropriate score for a movie that has basically come back from the dead. The picture quality is rather good apart from a few sections which do not detract from the movie. Unfortunately, there is some footage missing including a pageant scene, which one can only imagine was quite steamy. Overall, though, we can watch Beyond the Rocks in delight not only for its existence but also for its quality.

The extra features include a segment about the discovery of the film and a bit about the man who owned it. We get to see film preservationists at work and hear about a real-life eccentric collector. There is also a still gallery, some Valentino film trailers, and a second feature film. A Delicious Little Devil stars Mae Murray as an innocent girl out of work who gets a job in a nightclub impersonating a high-class woman involved in a scandal overseas. Valentino stars as her love interest; he is quite handsome despite all of his makeup. Murray toggles between Pickford-esque innocence to an overdone vamp like Nazimova. The quality of the print is not great. There are many scratches and sometimes the picture is washed out. However, as an additional film, this condition is more acceptable.

In her autobiography, Swanson begged the public to check their closets and attics for copies of her lost films including this one. It is too bad she did not live to see such a discovery, but nonetheless her wish was fulfilled. Let us hope that the publicity garnered by the event will inspire others to check their attics as well.",1168819200,12,2368,4.75669099756691
2584365,5,B000FSME5Q,"For decades it was thought that Beyond The Rocks, starring Rudolph Valentino and Gloria Swanson, was lost.  But it's back and with tons of extras explaining how the film was found, how it was restored and how they even made a new orchestral score.  Even a 85 minute recording of Gloria Swanson from 1955 talking about the film business and her life in general.  The Delicious Little Devil is a cool, funny, short movie and a delightful extra.

I first saw this film while traveling on a cruise ship in Alaska's Inland Passage.  Being set in such beautiful and wonderful setting, watching the film during a slow period between fine dinning and adventurous day trips, sandwiched between the white mountains and the deep waters, the silent treasure really hit me right in a soul already stripped of all defenses.  When I found out it was available on DVD I had to buy it.

From London to Paris, from the Swiss Alps to the dangerous Sahara Desert, the film allows the viewers to jump from one part of the world to another

following the romance of the two main characters as they fall in love, fall apart and come back together.  Frankly I feel sorry for the old rich husband.  He seems to truly love his young wife and ends up killing himself so that the younger couple could be happy.  Poor guy, he should have married for money instead of for love.  So the moral of the story - marry a gold digger.",1163894400,4,1397,4.478260869565218

Sadly, the only complaint I have is the music score.  I wasn't pleased as I didn't think it was done very well.  I highly recommend this film to all Valentino fans and silent film fans like myself.",1154476800,5,523,4.350515463917525
2584367,4,B000FSME5Q,"By now, anybody reading this review is aware of this legendary ""Lost"" film's miraculous recovery in the Netherlands, and Milestone deserves a great deal of credit for BEYOND THE ROCKS's dvd release thus placing it back in circulation after an 80-year absence. But, alas, the execution ultimately defeats the best intentions of the film museum and the archivists in two crucial areas.

First, the film is shown at the wrong speed - it's projected too slowly thus ruining the pacing and making all the actors look as though they are animated by stop-motion photography (think of the jerky way the dinosaurs moved in 1933's KING KONG and you'll know what I mean). During the silent film era there was no one ""correct"" film speed and many cinematographers preferred to handcrank their cameras and each had his own favorite speed, somewhere between 20 and 24 frames per second. On top of that, theater projectionists were often provided with cue sheets to vary the projector speed depending on the scene. For example, action scenes were speeded up and romantic scenes were slowed down. When ""talkies"" came in by the late 1920s, a uniform mechanized speed was required due to the need to synchronize the sound with the picture, thus 24 fps became the industry standard and it still is today.

BEYOND THE ROCKS would probably play too fast at sound speed, 24 fps, but fortunately today modern electronics can be used to run a silent film at whatever speed seems to lend itself to natural movement. Why ROCKS is run too slowly is a mystery to me and really hurts the film's impact.

The second problem is the atonal, modernistic, anachronistic, anti-historical, and just plain lousy music score that accompanies the film. Much of it sounds funereal, and one scene where the tempo finally becomes upbeat, at a swanky Parisian restaurant, the music is inappropriately Scott Joplin's ragtime. I don't mind using ""modern"" music if the mood fits the action but that's not the case here.

I hate to criticize without providing some constructive comments so if you're wondering how ROCKS should have been run, and how the music should have sounded, you only have to look at the dvd's bonus material and watch the bonus feature, A DELICIOUS LITTLE DEVIL, to find out. Why is DEVIL run at the proper speed giving the actors natural movements, and given a wonderfully compatible music accompaniment (even lilting I might say) while ROCKS is seriously mishandled in these same areas?

So it's great to be able to enjoy BEYOND THE ROCKS at all (too bad Miss Swanson - whom I met once - didn't live to see it) but I suspect that a second edition needs to be issued at some point in the future with the right speed and with a sympathetic score. But there are so many great bonus items (including DEVIL) on the current disc that Milestone seems to atone for the main feature's technical shortcomings (for which I suspect it is innocent) by giving us more than our money's worth. Bravo Milestone!",1153785600,15,2972,4.796875
2584368,5,B000FSME5Q,"There has been a lot of excitement and anticipation about the release of this 1922 silent film which was believed lost, and Milestone has done a marvellous job of meeting our high expectations by presenting a second film and various fascinating bonus features on this DVD.  ""Beyond the Rocks"" not only features the only pairing of two legendary silent screen stars, Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino, but the story itself was written by another big name of the 1920s, namely Elinor Glyn, who also wrote the story for ""It"" - another famous silent film starring Clara Bow.  Putting all these big names and talents together, it's no surprise that ""Beyond the Rocks"" was a much sought-after silent film for decades, hence the fuss over its unexpected discovery in the Netherlands in 2003.  As one might expect from an Elinor Glyn story and the established screen roles of Valentino and Swanson, ""Beyond the Rocks"" is a nice, old-fashioned love story with style and sophistication.  Swanson and Valentino play the lovers, but she is married to an older, wealthy man chosen by her family and she feels a duty to honour this `bargain'. Although the end may be predictable, the steps leading to it are not so clear, and there are a few little twists as the film reaches its climax, making it a good and entertaining story even apart from the star appeal of Valentino and Swanson.  Needless to say, both exude their usual on-screen charms and sweep the audience away on their romantic adventure; starting from a quaint English village, to the Alps, Versailles and finally the Sahara Desert.  There are only two segments lasting a few seconds where the film has irreparable damage; otherwise the picture quality is beautiful, and watching some of the bonus features which document the discovery and restoration work of this film, we can be thankful that it has come to us in this near-perfect condition.

I was also very pleased with the second film on this DVD, namely ""The Delicious Little Devil"" from 1919 in which Valentino stars opposite Mae Murray; another popular star of the silent era.  While Valentino plays the usual appealing role of the lover, it is Mae Murray, in my opinion, who steals the show in this surprisingly entertaining film with her vibrant, energetic and expressive manner.  The musical accompaniment chosen for each film is of a very high standard, and among the special bonus features, perhaps the most fascinating is an extensive recording of Gloria Swanson talking about her life; it plays instead of music to ""Beyond the Rocks"".  All these things together make this Milestone release well worth the long wait for both silent film enthusiasts and anyone just curious to see these two screen legends together.",1153699200,31,2731,4.930283224400871
2584369,4,B000FSME5Q,"After much fanfare in Europe and an arthouse release in America, BEYOND THE ROCKS has finally arrived on DVD. Had it featured no-name or forgotten silent era stars it wouldn't have made much noise and would have disappeared very quickly but with Valentino and Swanson on board you can clearly see the difference that a pair of Hollywood legends makes. Valentino in particular shows what a delicate and refined actor he could be when called on to do so. He does wonders with a character who is not given that much to do. Swanson gives it her best shot but her role differs little from her previous Cecil B. DeMille pictures and director Sam Wood doesn't have the DeMille touch with actresses. The film is good but not great but it's nice to have around especially in this restoration from the Netherlands Film Museum. There are a few rough spots and the tints are sometimes a little too intense but the overall result is very impressive. You get your choice of new background scores too. The 1919 Mae Murray vehicle THE DELICIOUS LITTLE DEVIL which is also included doesn't do much for Valentino but it shows Murray off to good advantage especially in some very revealing costumes that are quite racy for the time. The real reason to buy this disc is Gloria Swanson's 1955 recording about her life in the movies. Absolutely fascinating with sharp, witty and astute observations from someone who was actually there.

They were both involved with other people at the time, but Rudie bought Gloria a riding crop shortly before he burst on the scene as the world famous Latin lover.
This film is slow and a bit tedious at times, but Gloria certainly didn't disappoint the females in the audience with her luxurious costumes. Valentino is polite and charming and since I am a fan, it was worth watching. Some interesting camera techniques in the scenes where Gloria and Valentino are dressed in period costumes......
What I enjoyed even more than the film was from the bonus material,  the 1919 movie The Delicious Little Devil.
Mae Murray may have been a true ditz (and she plays one here too) but she was cute and you can definitely see that she had experience dancing in the Ziegfield Follies when she entertains at the Peach Tree Inn as ""the floor show.""
This movie is entertaining and as one of the other reviewers commented, it gives movie buffs a chance to see Mae Murray
