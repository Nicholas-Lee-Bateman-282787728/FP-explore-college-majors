6266550,4,B00IJS2OHM,"Closer to 3.7 stars, but ... Well acted, written and cinematography. Intelligent and naturalistic dialogue.
The problem is that believability was stretched to the limits; first, by the constant stream of obstacles and problems that pop up almost on cue which creates a lack of realism within the story. As a viewer it makes me too aware of how the script/story is evolving rather than just being absorbed into it. Second, by the improbable resolving of our twisty ending to the story. Left me with that ""Sure!"" credibility feeling.",1402185600,,531,4.977528089887641

6266558,4,B00IJS2OHM,"Even when people say terrible things you cant go with the evidence, you gotta go with your heart. Cate Mccall (Beckinsale) is a lawyeror at least she was. She has fallen on hard times and is trying to get her life back together. In order to be reinstated to the bar and get her kid back she must complete a 12 step program and work on the appeal of a woman who is in prison for murder.  What starts off as an easy case becomes more and more difficult with everything she uncovers. I was looking forward to watching this because I really love courtroom dramas. That said I liked this even more than I was expecting to. This is a movie that entirely sucks you in right away and you become deeply involved in Cates life. You pull for her to get her daughter back and are upset when she takes a step back. The court case is also unbelievably interesting and keeps the movie that much more interesting. This is the kind of movie that gets you thinking one way and at the last minute throws you a twist that makes you look back at everything you saw and wonder if you missed something. I don't want to give anything away but I will say that the movie is hard to predict, which is what makes it so good. If you liked And Justice For All you will love this movie. Overall, every now and then you watch a movie that sticks with you and you want everyone you know to watch it so you can discuss it with them. This is that movie. I give this an A.",1400889600,44,1436,4.110320284697509

6266565,4,B00IJS2OHM,"For a minute I thought I was watching the Hallmark Channel (no disrespect intended). Then the solid Kate Beckinsdale took over and what could have been another schmaltzy Recovery fable became a pretty good drama. If you hate AA and 12 Step Programs, don't watch this. If you are in a Program, and believe in the AA method of recovery this is a pretty good representation about how it actually works. And, what is best about this well written and well acted drama is that Recovery is not the headline - it is the personal struggle of Beckinsdale's Cate with a C to find herself in a very competitive world - the Los Angeles Law Profession. Plot is the once rising star is laid low by a bout with heavy drinking, is on the verge of losing her job, daughter and, most importantly, her self. She has the chance to get a seemingly wrongly convicted young lady out of prison and, well any more would spoil it. Alcoholism is a symptom of her selishness and self-centeredness, not the cause of her problems. Straight out of the Big Book, really. Other supporting actors and actresses are good, especially Nick Nolte, looking like the aging Hippie that he is. A big Bear of a man with a heart of gold. Once again, this could all be very cliche, but it is anchored by Beckinsdale's typically strong performance. Good stuff.",1487462400,4,1313,4.544303797468355
6266566,5,B00IJS2OHM,"This is the second time I've watched this. The first time was when I learned what a really good actress Kate Beckinsale is and how a crime drama which never hit the American market on the big screen or got any critical reviews could still be way better than most that get big releases. This hit every note perfectly including the acting, the dialogue, the court proceedings and the plot's twist and turns. Very satisfying film, which I highly recommend.",1484956800,,453,4.675

6266573,4,B00IJS2OHM,"I thought it was an unusual pairing, Nick Nolte as Kate Beckinsale's AA sponsor, but it worked well in a highly entertaining way. Nolte doesn't need to prove anything by way of acting. His gruff, no nonsense demeanor is perfect for specific characters and he did great in this role. And, I can't remember a movie that Kate Beckinsale has been in that I didn't like. She's not only one of the loveliest women on the planet, her talent can match even that. Watch it.

6266619,4,B00IJS2OHM,"This film had some potential, but a lack of decent characters other than our heroine of the piece, which hampers its dramatic development.

Kate Beckinsale plays the title role in The Trials Of Cate McCall and she's an inebriating lawyer separated from her partner and desperate not to lose custody of her daughter. Her main friend and confidante is her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor played by Nick Nolte. She is on supervisory suspension from the bar association and is assigned a case, which she does not wish to handle from Anna Annissimova who is in jail for a brutal murder. However, she needs to do the unsavoury task and win to solve her work problems and better place her in ensuing custody battle.

What follows is an interesting narrative, where doing the right thing is not always the right thing to do. This is a film which at times feels too condensed and seems to go through the motions. That said it is refreshing to see Beckinsale's comeback in film that does not deal with werewolves and vampires.

I think with a bit better writing this could have been a major triumph. Beckinsale's character was, at times, too self-indulgent and inclined to spend a lot of time on the self-pity. Nolte was interesting however, we see all too little of his character. This is a good film, the sad thing is it had the potential to be really good film.",1422403200,4,1351,4.644351464435147

Didn't anyone of these professionals see that they had a great idea but just kept ruining by continually running the audience down these 'dead end' rat holes. In the end, the film just made me mad! because I think if they'd had a few more adults working on this project, they could have developed a credible story and plot and could have ended up with a decent movie. But this 'Mish Mash"" just didn't work in any credible sense. It also shows why Beckinsale though very attractive is just not in the league with Nicole Kiddman!  Just compare this 'Dud' to the film ""Malice"" a very similar genre film and you'll see what I'm talking about.

So many movies these days come halfway in their presentations, not giving the actors enough time to give the audience a full view of the characters they portray. The storyline was good, but I am one who wishes that Hollywood changed their ways and would leave out all the bad language, this movie had its share.

6266678,4,B00IJS2OHM,"Troubled attorney Cate McCall is at a crossroads. She's lost custody of her daughter, she's a recovering alcoholic and she simply needs a break. With her trusted comrade in arms, Bridges, she decides that handling a wrongfully convicted inmate appeal may be just the ticket to her vindication and redemption. However, as she sinks her teeth into the case, and fights for who she believes is a wrongfully convicted murder suspect, she realizes that the truth is more complicated than she initially thought. I love a thriller that shows the delicate balance between right and wrong. And while I wasn't necessarily surprised at the end, I did like the way Cate's personal trials mirrored her professional ones.

In conclusion, I really enjoyed ""The Trials of Cate McCall"". I was glad to see Kate Beckinsale really sink her teeth into a roll that traditionally I hadn't seen her in. I am use to her looking put together and confident (i.e., Underworld franchise and Click), but in this one, she was a physical and emotional mess (I mean you could still see her beauty shining thru, but there was a vulnerability that shown as well). She was flawed and human. And as usual, Nick Nolte was a delight (Nolte played Bridges). He also plays that character that is authentic and honest (i.e., Prince of Tides). I would definitely recommend this movie and give it 4 stars.",1403654400,2,1361,4.816239316239316
6266679,5,B00IJS2OHM,"An interesting story well acted.  Be warned:  it's not light fare.  The lead struggles with alcoholism and it's painful to watch the relationship she has with her young daughter (her daughter lives with her ex-husband);  there are also explicit conversations about sex.  But the subject matter is done well and is appropriate to the story (it's not just thrown in for the sensational nature of it).

Did this just go straight to ""video""?  I thought it was going to be like a made-for-TV-movie quality, but it's not.  It's well done.  If you tend to like legal drama you should enjoy this.",1403395200,10,588,4.742574257425742

I have dealt with many attorneys in my day and have never heard language like this before.
So be prepared if you plan to watch it... not at all a family movie!",1402704000,7,438,4.475
6266687,5,B00IJS2OHM,"Your getting lucky when you select a film like ""The Trials Of Cate McCain"" even considering that it is such a mundane sounding title. Kate Beckensale as an attorney battling alcoholism is thoroughly absorbing as the splinters of life consume her. The film contains a wide array of excellent actors that most of us haven't seen in awhile and their portrayals are definitely worth multiple viewings. Nick Nolte especially, who's name I thought may have been stamped on the movie just to give it gravitas, is certainly compelling as he seemingly brings his life experience to the script and sells it 100%. A simple but subtly powerful performance as Beckensale's mentor.

A little history about this movie- It was released theatrically in Hungary and reportedly had a bad box office return. It was decided that a U.S. and UK release would be skipped. The film was bought by the Lifetime network and some watched it there giving it bad on line reviews, possibly because of its connection to a supposed low quality network and whatever else. Thankfully the theatrical version was cold pressed to dvd which saved it from bogus network editing. I also read that actor Taye Diggs was in the film but his scenes were removed. I find that odd but never the less he is listed as an actor in the film. My personal feelings are that marketing mistakes and knee jerk decisions caused this very good film to die an untimely movie theatre death.

Anyone that is either in recovery or recovered from substance abuse should seriously identify with many scenarios in the film but there are enough accurate emotional stirrings for the average movie goer to ponder as well. Ms. Beckensale is Oscar worthy as she navigates through the dilemmas of her fractured life. It's good to see the philosophy of the 12 steps incorporated into a movie in a realistic way. The believability factor is exceptionally high on all fronts. I intend to purchase this film and I obviously highly recommend it.",1402704000,,1968,4.819526627218935
6266688,4,B00IJS2OHM,"After viewing this movie, any doubt I had about the justice system being concerned about the truth and following the law, is sadly, truly solidified. Is this a true story? Absolutely. Only somebody else is going down. Again. Makes me wonder, just how many innocent people are convicted out of apathy, ego, and greed. A conspiracy combo destined to convict the innocent and free the guilty. What's strange is; I was surprised. Good court room drama? Hmmm",1402617600,,453,4.896103896103896
6266689,4,B00IJS2OHM,"Contains midpoint plot spoiler.

Cate (Kate Beckinsale) is on probation from the DAs office. She has a drinking issue which has compounded her problems as it has placed her on the ugly end of a custody case. The bad news is that Nick Nolte is the one helping to keep her sober (search Nolte 2002 DUI arrest photo). In spite of her personal issues, Cate is good in the courtroom and likes to win. She is given a pro bono case of a woman convicted of murder (Anna Anissimova) who claims she is innocent.

As Cate investigates the case she discovers layers of lies and misconduct by the police. She becomes convinced of her innocence and works to get her released in a courtroom case that goes like a hot knife through butter. In fact it was too easy as my John Katzenbach flashbacks materialized before my eyes. Ho-hum. I felt like I had been there and done that before.

The film was done fairly well for a 90 minute production. There were things that weren't explained. Was the car crash an attempt on her life or a co-incidence? In many ways the film felt incomplete. Her personal demons seemed glossed over and exactly how did her relationship fall so fast with her daughter, or did she ever have one?

In many ways it reminded me of a Lifetime film. 3 1/2 stars
