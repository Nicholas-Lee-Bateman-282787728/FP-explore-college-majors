3101987,5,B0013527I4,"Muppet Show Season 3 is (I am only on disc 1 so far) for me as good as the other two seasons. Why I am reviewing it now is to tell people that even if they are not a fan of the show and even if they are so so on buying it,it is worth it just to spend a few more minutes with the wonderful ( and taken from us  far too soon) Gilda Radner. Get it at least for that. I laughed at her antics and I cried for our loss",1211328000,,412,3.4301075268817205
3101988,5,B0013527I4,"Same reaction to this one as the other sets; I had forgotten over the years what a fantastic program this was. Stellar guests stars, family-style humor, and creativity that is rarely seen today. This 3rd Season set is no exception. Standout guest stars include Gilda Radner, Pearl Bailey, Jean Stapleton, Loretta Lynn, Liberace (!), Raquel Welch, Helen Reddy, Sylvester Stallone, Danny Kaye, Harry Belafonte, Lesley Ann Warren, Lynn Redgrave, Roy & Dale, Cheryl Ladd, and more. Unlike other variety shows, these guest stars genuinely seem to be having a ball and enjoying themselves. Cheryl Ladd's episode turned out to be one of my favorites; known mainly for ""Charlie's Angels,"" she shows plenty of talent in singing & dancing (even more so than the somewhat stiff Raquel Welch). Her karate duet with Miss Piggy (""I Enjoy Being A Girl"") is adorable. Jean Stapleton shows that she can carry a tune better than her famous character Edith Bunker; Gilda Radner also has a pleasing musical voice.

The Bonus Features are fantastic; ""Muppets on Puppets"" is a one-hour black & white TV show from 1968 that is a VERY behind the scenes look at puppets/muppets; the different types, how to make them work, how to create them, and even a ""behind the wall"" look at Jim Henson & Frank Oz performing. Adults will really enjoy this; warning for parents who don't want children know how the ""magic"" happens, you may want to skip over this extra. Interesting to see Henson's flat-line persona in contrast to his extremely creative handling/vocals for the muppets.

""A Company of Players"" is a present day featurette that also goes behind the scenes; VERY cool to learn about how Miss Piggy came to be (especially the ""why"" behind her infamous karate chops!) and the way that Frank Oz & Jim Henson worked together (likened to any famous comedy duo). The happy camaraderie in front of the camera also existed behind the scenes.

The Purina Dog Chow commercials are black and white featuring Rowlf the Dog & Baskerville; they are truly funny (still!). What they lack in picture quality, they make up for in fun. Sure is refreshing to see a simple commercial that can sell the message.

Overall picture/sound quality on this set is high; many older shows shot on videotape have not held up over the years; this one IS an exception. Good color and image detail (you can even see the wood grain on the set doors), and the sound is pleasing also.

For families, children, and Muppet fans, this set is a must-have!",1209772800,42,2491,4.8243559718969555
3101989,5,B0013527I4,"This is the season the show finally hit it's stride.  The episode with Harry Belefonte was nominated for an Emmy Award (r); Henson and Oz seem to get the best from the visiting talent, including dancing and singing from Raquel Welch (who'd've thought); and the maturing of the Muppet supporting characters, especially Miss Piggy and Gonzo.  The production numbers are more imaginative, the jokes are a little more contemporary, the talent more A list.",1209772800,4,451,5.081081081081081
3101990,5,B0013527I4,"This is the Muppets DVD I've been waiting all along for.  This one features the episode guest starring Roger Miller, who was a fairly forgetable country singer.  But the running gag of this particular episode is probably the best one that was ever done on the Muppets.  Through most of the episode, the Muppets contract something called Cluckitis and one by one sneeze and turn into chickens.  Kermit is one of the last to transform, but he is definitely the funniest looking chicken of the lot.  In the end, the only ones who aren't chickens are Gonzo (it would be hard to make him look any sillier) and Statler and Waldorf (who turn into DOGS!)
Also on this volume are perhaps the two most legendary country singers in history, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.",1206662400,7,756,4.611940298507463

In line at Best Buy, that's what the mom behind me was saying this morning, still half in disbelief that she was buying yet another season of these 30-year-old TV programs. And to me, that one sentence sums it all up. ""The Muppet Show"" offers comedy that appeals to all ages -- most episodes include MuppetLabs, Pigs in Space, Swedish Chef or other recurring skits -- as well as wonderful old ditties and show tunes that are themselves often staged with a sly sense of humor.

This third season is perhaps the best of all. Digitally remastered like those on the earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-One/dp/B0009ULBGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-Two/dp/B000Q6774K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season Two</a>&nbsp;sets, these 24 shows from 1978-1979 are the Muppets at their peak. Hosts include a broad range of personalities, from rocker Alice Cooper to Irish comedian Spike Milligan.

And good news for music lovers: unlike Season Two, this set includes its song lyrics in its captioning!

Here's the complete line-up:

EPISODE 1: Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge. Nothing dated here except the blow-dried hair of Kristofferson, who can't keep a straight face as he serenades Miss Piggy with ""Help Me Make It Through the Night."" Coolidge sings ""We're All Alone."" When Sam the Eagle adds commentary to Rowlf's ""A Frog He Would A-Wooing Go,"" his insights include ""This shows us that there was indeed a time when frogs went 'woo.'"" Fozzie and Rowlf do a rousing version of ""Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee (An Actor's Life for Me).""

EPISODE 2: Leo Sayer. Has Kermit got a new girlfriend? Piggy thinks so, after starlet pig Annie Sue shows up. Meanwhile, the very-70s Sayer boogies down with a human-sized peacock as he sings ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing."" Other songs: ""The Show Must Go On,"" ""When I Need You.""

EPISODE 3: Roy Clark. With silk shirts and very wide lapels, the country star declares he feels like he's ""back on the farm."" Ah, the 70s. Songs include the bouncy ""Sally Was a Good Ol' Girl"" and the oh-so-serious ""Yesterday When I Was Young."" In skits, the Swedish Chef gets attacked by a pile of living dough, while the Pigs in Space helplessly bounce up and down after Dr. Strangepork fixes the Swinetrek with toaster parts.

EPISODE 4: Gilda Radner. Terrific! A 7-foot-tall talking carrot (with an attitude!) joins Radner in a medley of ""I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major General"" and other selections from ""The Pirates of Penzance."" Stuck to Beaker with MuppetLabs super glue, Radner attempts ""Tap Your Troubles Away"" from ""Mack & Mabel."" Muppet numbers include a terrific version of ""Lullaby of Broadway."" Confusing the word ""Muppets"" with ""muffins,"" Emily Litella opens the show.

EPISODE 5: Pearl Bailey. The host does a great job with ""In the Good Old Summertime"" and a medley of show tunes including ""Hello, Dolly!,"" ""Anything You Can Do"" and ""Everything's Coming Up Roses."" In skits, Dr. Honeydew invents Edible Paperclips, while the Pigs in Space turn into food when their Swinetrek passes through a field of Snacko Waves.

EPISODE 6: Jean Stapleton. Annie Sue leads the pigs in the rowdy 1917 Brazilian classic ""Tico-Tico no Fub"" (""tico tico tico clock!"") and joins Rowlf for the 19th-century ditty ""Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow."" Best known as Edith from ""All in the Family,"" the host sings ""I'm Just Wild About Harry,"" joins Fozzie for Irving Berlin's 1914 standard, ""Play a Simple Melody"" and shocks Sam with the news that the Swedish Chef doesn't speak real Swedish.

EPISODE 7: Alice Cooper. Cheesy effects, silly makeup and bad lip-synching mar the host's supposedly serious productions of ""Welcome to My Nightmare,"" ""You and Me"" and ""School's Out."" The worst show of the season.

EPISODE 8: Loretta Lynn. One of the few Muppet Shows that doesn't take place in the regular theater, this country-music show is set in a train station. Songs include ""You're Lookin' at Country"" (Loretta with Lubbock Lou and his Jughuggers) and ""Sentimental Journey"" (Gonzo).

EPISODE 9: Liberace. Chaos reigns when Gonzo tries to get his tap-dancing chickens into a Liberace spectacular. Also included: a Swedish Chef sketch that turns into an episode of Pigs in Space.

EPISODE 10: Marisa Berenson. The Swedish Chef makes the wedding cake as Miss Piggy and Kermit head to the altar. Of course things don't work out. A 1960s model turned actress (""Cabaret,"" ""Barry Lyndon""), Berenson sings two songs.

EPISODE 11: Raquel Welch. Miss Piggy and Welch don identical low-cut gowns to perform ""I Am Woman."" Also features a good Swedish Chef skit about chicken in a basket.

EPISODE 12: James Coco. Not that memorable. The highlight: Coco sings Randy Newman's ""Short People"" with a group of tiny Muppets.

EPISODE 13: Helen Reddy. Miss Piggy sings ""Stayin' Alive."" Reddy and Kermit perform ""You and Me Against the World."" Reddy and Sopwith the Camel do ""We'll Sing in the Sunshine.""

EPISODE 14: Harry Belafonte. Of course there's ""Day-O"" (with a pig chorus), but Belafonte also performs a wonderful African song, ""Turn the World Around,"" accompanied by Muppets wearing African masks.

EPISODE 15: Lesley Ann Warren. The Great Gonzo rides his motorcycle up a ramp into Statler and Waldorf's theater box. Warren performs a ""Beasty and the Beaut"" ballet with Doglion. Miss Piggy takes over the Swinetrek.

EPISODE 16: Danny Kaye. Some strange sights: The Swedish Chef with a human partner (Kaye, who refers to the chef as ""Tom"") and Statler and Waldorf out of their box (disgusted with the show, they head out to the back alley).

EPISODE 17: Spike Milligan. Note my byline and you'll understand why I love this one. It includes a group performance of ""It's a Small World"" on a set that bears a remarkable resemblance to a certain Disney attraction.

EPISODE 18: Leslie Uggams. A great guest appearance from Big Bird from Sesame Street. In one skit, it's love at first sight for Gonzo when Big Bird wanders onstage. ""Wow! Perfection incarnate!"" the chicken lover exclaims as he spots the giant feathered fellow. ""Statuesque, yet still poultry in every sense!"" There's also a funny MuppetLabs skit about fireproof paper.

EPISODE 19: Elke Sommer. One of the weaker episodes, this is another one that just doesn't age well. The one-time sex symbol performs ""Animal Crackers in My Soup"" and, dressed as Cleopatra, ""Row, Row, Row.""

EPISODE 20: Sylvester Stallone. Again not my favorite, but there is one memorable skit: in a gladiator sketch, Stallone and a full-size lion perform ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off.""

EPISODE 21: Roger Miller. Lots of music. Penguins on the Mayflower sing ""Alabamy Bound,"" Miller joins some watermelons for ""In the Summertime,"" Miller and a Whatnots trio do ""Hat,"" Muppets in a pub perform ""Down at the Old Bull and Bush,"" Rowlf plays ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" (and turns into a chicken) and Miller joins some Muppet chickens for a medley of ""You Had a Do Wacka Do,"" ""Dang Me,"" ""My Uncle Used to Love Me But She Died"" and ""You Can't Rollerskate in a Buffalo Herd.""

EPISODE 22: Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. A herd of cows goes mad for Fozzie's cow jokes in this cowboy-themed episode (Fozzie: ""You cows are an udder delight!). Prairie dogs sing ""Blue Skies,"" Roy and Dale perform ""Skyball Paint,"" ""Deep in the Heart of Texas"" and a medley of ""Hazy Mountains,"" ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" and ""Happy Trails.""

EPISODE 23: Lynn Redgrave. Veering away from the variety-show format, this episode is a 25-minute Muppet production of ""Robin Hood,"" with Kermit as Robin, Redgrave as Maid Marian, Fozzie as Little John and Gonzo as the Sheriff of Nottingham. The Town Crier declares ""Five o'clock and all's well! Except that Maid Marian has been kidnapped, the Sheriff's up to no good, that dog is stealing the cheese, Kermit's mad at Piggy, and it's really only 4:30.""

EPISODE 24: Cheryl Ladd. Skits include Miss Piggy and Ladd trashing their dressing room as they sing ""I Enjoy Being a Girl."" In ""Pigs in Space,"" Dr. Strangepork invents a pill that makes pigs invisible.

Bonus features include ""The Muppets on Puppets,"" a 60-minute documentary from 1968. Jim Henson, Rowlf the Dog and Muppet design chief Don Sahlin demonstrate how to build and operate a hand puppet and review the various types of puppets as well as the history of the art and its use of special effects. The DVD set also includes a new featurette, ""The Making of The Muppets.""

As before, the menu screens are live-action. On one, Miss Piggy advises you to ""only watch the scenes with me. Trust me, some of the other stuff is just plain weird!""

On the front of the box, Fozzie's fur is not only very orange (more so than indicated on the image above), it's fuzzy.",1202083200,320,8885,5.048497267759563

""The Muppet Show - Season Three"" DVD Features:
* 24 episodes of ""The Muppet Show"" - The complete third season with digitally restored picture and sound!
* Muppets on Puppets
In June of 1968, Jim Henson, Frank Oz, Jerry Juhl and Don Sahlin traveled to Hershey, Pennsylvania to tape a program about puppetry at the studios of public television station WITF-TV. This show, ""Muppets on Puppets"" aired on NET (National Educational Television - the precursor to PBS) in most areas in 1970. This rarely seen one-hour program, hosted by Jim Henson and Rowlf the Dog, is a unique opportunity to see the creators of the Muppets in their early days as puppeteers.

* ""A Frog Is Born"" - An all-new featurette exploring the origins of Kermit the Frog and his relationship with creator, Jim Henson.
* A Company of Players
An intimate look behind the scenes with the puppeteers. This original featurette includes all-new interviews with Martin Baker, Bill Barretta, Kevin Clash, Bonnie Erickson, Karen Falk, Michael K. Frith, Amy van Gilder, Dave Goelz, Jane Gootnick, Jerry Juhl, Brian Henson, Kathy Mullen, and Steve Whitmire.

* Muppet Commercials
Rowlf the Dog made his television debut in these rare commercials produced for Purina Dog Chow between 1962 and 1963. Rowlf went on to become a national star on ""The Jimmy Dean Show"" (1963-1966) before settling into his role as the resident piano-playing hound dog on ""The Muppet Show"". His sidekick in these spots, Baskerville, also was occasionally seen on ""The Muppet Show"" as well. Four original commercials are presented here
Live-Video Menus

3102058,5,B0013527I4,"The mayhem and fun of The Muppet Show is back for season three.  And the laughs and jokes are just as plentiful as ever.

In case you have miss the fun that is this show, The Muppet Show was created during the late 70's and the early 80's, the era of the variety show.  And that's exactly what you get here.  The big difference is that the normal stars of the show are The Muppets, big puppets.  Each episodes features one or two human guest stars.  Depending on the star and the episode, some do more than others.  But most of the show is carried by The Muppets.

The show tends to shift between the acts on stage and various antics backstage, where emcee Kermit the Frog is trying to keep everything running smoothly.  Unfortunately, the rest of the cast doesn't keep things easy for him.  There's Miss Piggy, who thinks she should be the star and resents new female pig Annie Sue.  Fozzie Bear tries to come up with a funny act, only to continue to fail.  Speaking of failing, there's Gonzo who tries to do the impossible and finds out that, well, it's impossible.

Several sketches pop up multiple times over the course of the season.  The most frequent is Pigs in Space, a Star Trek spoof with hilarious results.  My favorite is the less frequently scene Veterinarian's Hospital.  That show puts the pun in anything over and over again.  There's Muppet Labs, where Dr. Honeydew and his assistant Beaker show off the latest and greatest inventions.  Okay, the latest inventions anyway.  We get treated to the latest breaking news and some of the weirdest sports you've ever seen.  And we also find out the Swedish Chef's real language (hint, it isn't faux Swedish).

And there are the guest stars.  Since these episodes are from 1978, many of them are no longer household names.  I was left scratching my head at the likes of Leo Sayer or Elke Sommers.  However, others I did know like Lesley Ann Warren, Helen Reddy, or Sylvester Stallone.  Quite often, if I know the guest star before the show, I find the jokes funnier.  That's not always the case, however, because I found the episode with Irish comedian Spike Milligan, a man I'd never heard of before, to be one of the funniest.

The show takes a few liberties with the format in this season.  They do one complete episode at a train station (while the theater is being fumigated).  In the Lynn Redgrave episode, they put on a production of Robin Hood.  One episode features a salute to all the countries that air the show.  That one ends with a spot on production of ""It's a Small World"" that even had this fan of the song and ride laughing.  These types of things keep the show entertaining.

Not that they need the help.  This show continues to put out some of the funniest stuff, even all these years later.  Okay, it does help if you are a fan of the silly.  Some of what happens is downright strange.  But if you can get into the right mindset, you'll be laughing your head off.  And if you can't?  Well, there are always Statler and Waldorf, the two gentlemen in the balcony who constantly heckle and put down the show.  I'm sure you'll agree with their comments.  (Or you can be like me.  I love their heckling even if I've enjoyed the act we just saw.)

Because this is a variety show, you'll find they don't just do comedy sketched but also include music and dancing.  Some of these are played for laughs (Harry Belafonte gets one of the funniest songs of the season), while others are played straight, like when Liberace guest stars.  Occasionally, I find that the songs slow things down, but I usually enjoy these more mellow interludes.

There were 24 episodes in season three, and all of them are here on four discs.  The last disc in the set includes an hour long presentation on puppets and how they create and perform as the Muppets, a few commercials that predate the show, and interviews with some of the Muppeteers talking about their time on the show.

All in all, The Muppet Show continues to entertain with its third season.  Now that I'm finally caught up, I hope they release a new set very soon.",1430784000,,4081,4.494550408719346

If showstopping musical numbers, humor equal parts pun-derful and absurd, and an affectionate ribbing of show business are your things, you can't miss The Muppet Show Season Three.

It keeps them entertained specially in long road trips and it introduces them to artists of years past, some of which have past away but that never the less will always be famous entertainers.

The Main Features: As you access the interactive menu, you'll face some funny skits by Kermit and Piggy. As we should and can expect from a Disney release, this set features all the 24 episodes of season 3, fully restored and shiny, and most important complete with UK skits.

Bonus material: Altough video quality is very high, you'll notice audio skips and mutes from time to time. Even I have seen copies of the rare 1968 documentary ""Muppets on Puppets"" with full audio. The master original must have been damaged. But that's the only down point.
Then we have a set of vintage 1960s Purina Dog Chow commercials, with Rowlf and Baskerville, that are a treat to see, altough very short, and a featurette by the name of "" A Company of Players "", with interviews and such. Very interesting.

Conclusion: Very recommended. If you are a Muppet fan and lover, this will bring back countless memories!",1216771200,,1144,4.598039215686274

3102265,5,B0013527I4,"Wow!  What can I say.  The Muppet Show was my first favorite television program and will forever be associated with great memories of hanging out with my parents, just laughing and having a good time.  My immediate memories of the show were hazy from time, but I was really surprised at how much of this stuff I remembered and the overwhelming sense of familiarity I have with the show.  It's like seeing an old friend after years apart and not missing a beat -- there's no need to catch up because everything that was once there still is!

So funny, so creative, so groundbreaking, so great.

I highly recommend checking out these DVD sets.  If you are unfamiliar with the series, you will certainly be pleased.  And if it's been awhile since you last checked in with the Muppets, your old friends are just as great as you remember.

And to tide you over while waiting for your  order to arrive, here's a taste of what the Muppets are up to today:

One thing I missed from Season Two and Three that was part of Season One was the ability to turn on pop up trivia about the characters, the guest stars, or micellaneous facts about things that we happening on stage.  Season Three includes a pre-PBS special on the creation of puppets and Muppets and gives everyone great insight into what goes into making a Muppet and how they are worked.",1214179200,3,481,4.647058823529412

3102271,5,B0013527I4,"I have all 3 avalible seasons in special edition and can't wait for 4 and 5! Although I miss the pop up Muppetisms from season 1 having the behind the scenes footage makes up for it. There is nothing, absolutely nothing like the Muppet Show.

If you remember when the first show came out you'll want this. Each episode contains something you've never seen before, a sketch that was only aired in the UK version. That's right, there were 2 different versions of each episode, the US version would have one musical number while the UK version would have a completely different one. The sound and picture is clear and if you look close you might spot the very rare top of the head or mysterious third arm coming in to frame.

For those new to the Muppets this is a treat. These are the origonal Muppeteers, the late Jim Henson and Richard Hunt and the pretty much retired Frank Oz and Jerry Nelson, Dave Goelz and Steve Whitmere round out the key cast along with Louise Gold and perhaps even a young Brian Henson throwing penguins.

Don't worry about letting young viewers watch, this is true family friendly entertainment. On the season 3 set you even get a rare and wonderful look at how puppets work. This should spark many a curious mind and get many new Muppeteers off and running. Some of their performers, Richard Hunt and Bill Baretta to name a few, started off as fans and became members of the family.",1213833600,4,1408,4.513725490196078

This was a marvelous collection of the third season of The Muppet Show.  Many bright stars of the time are on here.  The only thing I wish would be added - maybe to the next couple of seasons is that there would be a brief biography of the guest.  Sometimes I don't know who they are or what they were famous for and the show only shows a brief look at their talents - many times expanding out of their known talents.  It's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It's one of the things that I liked about the first season with the pop up trivia.",1213747200,,756,5.163934426229508

3102277,4,B0013527I4,"Season 3 of the Muppet Show is one I have been waiting for a long time.  Most of these episodes are one I haven't seen, and I enjoying watching them for the first time.  I love the Harry Belafonte episode more that ever before.

A few things make me rate this set 4 out of 5 stars.

First, as others have noticed, no Muppet Morsels.  The First season DVD was awesome because it gave some behind the scenes information that Muppet fans really want to know about.  And I thought that since it was in the first season it would continue through the rest of the series.  Sadly, it's missing in Seasons 2 AND 3.

Second, the 10 minute mini-documentary ""Company of Players"" is just too short!  It looked like there was a lot of footage taken from the old Muppet performers in interviews, and I could easily see that this could have stretched out at least an hour.  Again, Muppet fans want to see and hear what it was like during the zany times on the show.

And thirdly - and this is technical issue - It seems that on my copy of the DVD, that the second disk was authored incorrectly.  Anytime I go the ""Episode Selection"" screen and choose Helen Reddy's episode, Alice Cooper's starts instead.  The only way I could watch the Helen Reddy episode is to ""Play All"" and skip all the scenes until her episode started.

Overall, this season of the Muppet is the best in video and audio quality, and is definitely worth picking up.  If a few things could be added, this would have been a 5 star pick.

But because of the aforementioned concerns, I give it 4 out 5 stars.",1212019200,4,1559,4.324137931034483
3102278,5,B0013527I4,"his set marks the third of five seasons that will hopefully all come to DVD soon. After watching the first three seasons, it only serves to remind me how great this show was and how today's families are fortunate for the opportunity to see this kind of quality and creativity today.

Genius is a word commonly attributed to Jim Henson, as well as some of his longtime collaborators, such as Frank Oz and Jerry Nelson, but the show itself is an ingenious concoction as well. Under the guise of constant self-deprecation, it is actually a meticulously crafted blend of vaudeville, TV variety and satire that constantly reflects within itself with a sharp irony much like that which is attributed to David Letterman and Conan O'Brien. It's a variety show that sends up variety shows.

In the first season DVD set, you could trace the development of the characters, particularly Miss Piggy. She went from being a chorus girl (often with differing voices) to a major international star. I'll never forget when Siskel and Ebert went into a lengthy debate about her performance in The Great Muppet Caper, before catching themselves in the absurdity of it all (""Can you believe we're talking about a piece of foam with more depth than many flesh and blood actors performing today?"")

By season three, the show had found its identity and gained the kind of clout and chic that attracted the ""in"" celebrities of the day (Gilda Radner, for example). Ironically, some of these guest stars are the most dated aspects of the series. The bizarre, unpredictable style of a series at its peak is very much in evidence. The Loretta Lynn episode takes place in a railroad station, the Marisa Berenson show features the ""wedding"" of Kermit and Piggy, and the Lynn Redgrave show is an original musical version of ""Robin Hood.""

For fans of ""Muppet*Vision 3-D"" at the Disney parks, there are echoes in the Spike Milligan episode (which has a ""Small World"" finale) and the masterful show with Pearl Bailey that randomly combines Broadway show tunes with reckless abandon.

Not much in the way of extras, though the ""Muppets on Puppets,"" a black and white documentary created for public TV in 1968, is a treat. A sweet new documentary short, ""The Making of The Muppets,"" is just that, sweet but short. It would have been nice to have more of those pop-ups that added so much inside info to the Season One set -- not that I'm complaining, though, I'm just glad to have this show on DVD and love sharing it with the kids.",1212019200,,2495,4.73963133640553
3102279,4,B0013527I4,"Growing up Muppet-style wasn't a choice, it was mandatory! From corny jokes and wild band members (Animal was my favorite), to grumpy old men booing in the balcony and listening to singing, dancing, and the acting talent of the day, The Muppet Show still holds nostalgic sway for those of us who grew up watching Jim Henson's puppeted cadre. Season three started off with a bang as singer Rita Coolridge graced the show with her amazing voice and actor Kris Kristofferson decided to rough-up a few of the cast. The show really got blazing, though, during episode four when Gilda Radner took a liking to Kermit, much to the chagrin (and karate chop) of Miss Piggy. But the Muppet brigade took a stunning jolt in episode seven when Alice Cooper was the guest star. Playing with the Muppet band, Alice took the show to a whole new level, showing U.S. audiences that puppets can be topical (and controversial?). It was then that The Muppet Show really started to take wing. Actors, musicians, and many other Hollywood talents began showing up in season three. From the voluptuous Rachel Welch and exceptionally talented Harry Bellafonte, to muscle man Sly Stallone and blonde bombshell Cheryl Ladd, the show gained notoriety from new quarters.

The amazing thing about The Muppet Show is that kids and adults can both enjoy it, but on totally different levels. Kids will probably like the physical comedy (watching Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker blow up the lab, or having a dog operate in an episode of Animal Hospital, ""A show that has gone to the dogs."") while adults will be amazed at the interspecies attractions between the likes of Kermit and Miss Piggy, or Gonzo (whatever he is) and his chickens (note the plural there; was he a polygamist?)

No mention of The Muppet Show would be complete without noting the supporting cast. Two favorites tend to be Waldorf and Statler, the old hecklers that are perched in the balcony and heave insults and boos at the cast. My other personal favorite is Sam the Eagle (so overly-pompous).

Digitally remastered just like seasons one and two, the sound and visual qualities on most HD TVs is quite nice but still iffy in places. If you don't have an HDTV, you'll probably still enjoy it, but I'd recommend seeing it in all its digitally intended glory.

This latest release has some interesting packaging that I should mention. The cover-image of Fozzie actually has a soft texture that resembles his fur. Animal packaging? And there are some cool extra features, too:

""Muppets on Puppets"" is a sixty-minute feature. Hosted by Jim Henson, it looks at the early formation of the Muppets. A rare feature that appeared first in 1969. Great Muppet history for those that want to be ""in-the-know.""

""A Company of Players"" is a behind the scenes look at the puppeteers. The fascinating work of master puppeteers comes to light. For those that don't want the magic spoiled, you might want to pass on this one.

""Muppets Commercials"" are a couple of Purina Dog Chow commercials that are hysterically funny.

A Trailer for Disney's upcoming release ""Wall-E"" and an advertisement for the new 2-Disc and Blu-Ray editions of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas.""

The Muppet Show ran for five years (1976 through 1980) and here in season three they were hitting an incredibly smooth stride. All the cast, crew, and guests appeared relaxed and to have enjoyed themselves immensely. The Alice Cooper episode is a must see, at the very least. Unfortunately there is no Blu-Ray disc release of any of the series, but I have a feeling they're coming. And if they don't come out in the near future, I'm gonna send out Miss Piggy to find out why.

3336484,5,B0013527I4,"Muppet Show Season 3 is (I am only on disc 1 so far) for me as good as the other two seasons. Why I am reviewing it now is to tell people that even if they are not a fan of the show and even if they are so so on buying it,it is worth it just to spend a few more minutes with the wonderful ( and taken from us  far too soon) Gilda Radner. Get it at least for that. I laughed at her antics and I cried for our loss",1211328000,,412,3.4301075268817205
3336485,5,B0013527I4,"Same reaction to this one as the other sets; I had forgotten over the years what a fantastic program this was. Stellar guests stars, family-style humor, and creativity that is rarely seen today. This 3rd Season set is no exception. Standout guest stars include Gilda Radner, Pearl Bailey, Jean Stapleton, Loretta Lynn, Liberace (!), Raquel Welch, Helen Reddy, Sylvester Stallone, Danny Kaye, Harry Belafonte, Lesley Ann Warren, Lynn Redgrave, Roy & Dale, Cheryl Ladd, and more. Unlike other variety shows, these guest stars genuinely seem to be having a ball and enjoying themselves. Cheryl Ladd's episode turned out to be one of my favorites; known mainly for ""Charlie's Angels,"" she shows plenty of talent in singing & dancing (even more so than the somewhat stiff Raquel Welch). Her karate duet with Miss Piggy (""I Enjoy Being A Girl"") is adorable. Jean Stapleton shows that she can carry a tune better than her famous character Edith Bunker; Gilda Radner also has a pleasing musical voice.

The Bonus Features are fantastic; ""Muppets on Puppets"" is a one-hour black & white TV show from 1968 that is a VERY behind the scenes look at puppets/muppets; the different types, how to make them work, how to create them, and even a ""behind the wall"" look at Jim Henson & Frank Oz performing. Adults will really enjoy this; warning for parents who don't want children know how the ""magic"" happens, you may want to skip over this extra. Interesting to see Henson's flat-line persona in contrast to his extremely creative handling/vocals for the muppets.

""A Company of Players"" is a present day featurette that also goes behind the scenes; VERY cool to learn about how Miss Piggy came to be (especially the ""why"" behind her infamous karate chops!) and the way that Frank Oz & Jim Henson worked together (likened to any famous comedy duo). The happy camaraderie in front of the camera also existed behind the scenes.

The Purina Dog Chow commercials are black and white featuring Rowlf the Dog & Baskerville; they are truly funny (still!). What they lack in picture quality, they make up for in fun. Sure is refreshing to see a simple commercial that can sell the message.

Overall picture/sound quality on this set is high; many older shows shot on videotape have not held up over the years; this one IS an exception. Good color and image detail (you can even see the wood grain on the set doors), and the sound is pleasing also.

For families, children, and Muppet fans, this set is a must-have!",1209772800,42,2491,4.8243559718969555
3336486,5,B0013527I4,"This is the season the show finally hit it's stride.  The episode with Harry Belefonte was nominated for an Emmy Award (r); Henson and Oz seem to get the best from the visiting talent, including dancing and singing from Raquel Welch (who'd've thought); and the maturing of the Muppet supporting characters, especially Miss Piggy and Gonzo.

Through most of the episode, the Muppets contract something called Cluckitis and one by one sneeze and turn into chickens.  Kermit is one of the last to transform, but he is definitely the funniest looking chicken of the lot.  In the end, the only ones who aren't chickens are Gonzo (it would be hard to make him look any sillier) and Statler and Waldorf (who turn into DOGS!)

In line at Best Buy, that's what the mom behind me was saying this morning, still half in disbelief that she was buying yet another season of these 30-year-old TV programs. And to me, that one sentence sums it all up. ""The Muppet Show"" offers comedy that appeals to all ages -- most episodes include MuppetLabs, Pigs in Space, Swedish Chef or other recurring skits -- as well as wonderful old ditties and show tunes that are themselves often staged with a sly sense of humor.

This third season is perhaps the best of all.

Hosts include a broad range of personalities, from rocker Alice Cooper to Irish comedian Spike Milligan.

And good news for music lovers: unlike Season Two, this set includes its song lyrics in its captioning!

Here's the complete line-up:

EPISODE 1: Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge. Nothing dated here except the blow-dried hair of Kristofferson, who can't keep a straight face as he serenades Miss Piggy with ""Help Me Make It Through the Night."" Coolidge sings ""We're All Alone."" When Sam the Eagle adds commentary to Rowlf's ""A Frog He Would A-Wooing Go,"" his insights include ""This shows us that there was indeed a time when frogs went 'woo.'"" Fozzie and Rowlf do a rousing version of ""Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee (An Actor's Life for Me).""

EPISODE 2: Leo Sayer. Has Kermit got a new girlfriend? Piggy thinks so, after starlet pig Annie Sue shows up. Meanwhile, the very-70s Sayer boogies down with a human-sized peacock as he sings ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing."" Other songs: ""The Show Must Go On,"" ""When I Need You.""

EPISODE 3: Roy Clark. With silk shirts and very wide lapels, the country star declares he feels like he's ""back on the farm."" Ah, the 70s. Songs include the bouncy ""Sally Was a Good Ol' Girl"" and the oh-so-serious ""Yesterday When I Was Young."" In skits, the Swedish Chef gets attacked by a pile of living dough, while the Pigs in Space helplessly bounce up and down after Dr. Strangepork fixes the Swinetrek with toaster parts.

EPISODE 4: Gilda Radner. Terrific! A 7-foot-tall talking carrot (with an attitude!) joins Radner in a medley of ""I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major General"" and other selections from ""The Pirates of Penzance."" Stuck to Beaker with MuppetLabs super glue, Radner attempts ""Tap Your Troubles Away"" from ""Mack & Mabel."" Muppet numbers include a terrific version of ""Lullaby of Broadway."" Confusing the word ""Muppets"" with ""muffins,"" Emily Litella opens the show.

EPISODE 5: Pearl Bailey. The host does a great job with ""In the Good Old Summertime"" and a medley of show tunes including ""Hello, Dolly!,"" ""Anything You Can Do"" and ""Everything's Coming Up Roses."" In skits, Dr. Honeydew invents Edible Paperclips, while the Pigs in Space turn into food when their Swinetrek passes through a field of Snacko Waves.

EPISODE 6: Jean Stapleton. Annie Sue leads the pigs in the rowdy 1917 Brazilian classic ""Tico-Tico no Fub"" (""tico tico tico clock!"") and joins Rowlf for the 19th-century ditty ""Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow."" Best known as Edith from ""All in the Family,"" the host sings ""I'm Just Wild About Harry,"" joins Fozzie for Irving Berlin's 1914 standard, ""Play a Simple Melody"" and shocks Sam with the news that the Swedish Chef doesn't speak real Swedish.

EPISODE 7: Alice Cooper. Cheesy effects, silly makeup and bad lip-synching mar the host's supposedly serious productions of ""Welcome to My Nightmare,"" ""You and Me"" and ""School's Out."" The worst show of the season.

EPISODE 8: Loretta Lynn. One of the few Muppet Shows that doesn't take place in the regular theater, this country-music show is set in a train station. Songs include ""You're Lookin' at Country"" (Loretta with Lubbock Lou and his Jughuggers) and ""Sentimental Journey"" (Gonzo).

EPISODE 9: Liberace. Chaos reigns when Gonzo tries to get his tap-dancing chickens into a Liberace spectacular. Also included: a Swedish Chef sketch that turns into an episode of Pigs in Space.

EPISODE 10: Marisa Berenson. The Swedish Chef makes the wedding cake as Miss Piggy and Kermit head to the altar. Of course things don't work out. A 1960s model turned actress (""Cabaret,"" ""Barry Lyndon""), Berenson sings two songs.

EPISODE 11: Raquel Welch. Miss Piggy and Welch don identical low-cut gowns to perform ""I Am Woman."" Also features a good Swedish Chef skit about chicken in a basket.

EPISODE 12: James Coco. Not that memorable. The highlight: Coco sings Randy Newman's ""Short People"" with a group of tiny Muppets.

EPISODE 13: Helen Reddy. Miss Piggy sings ""Stayin' Alive."" Reddy and Kermit perform ""You and Me Against the World."" Reddy and Sopwith the Camel do ""We'll Sing in the Sunshine.""

EPISODE 14: Harry Belafonte. Of course there's ""Day-O"" (with a pig chorus), but Belafonte also performs a wonderful African song, ""Turn the World Around,"" accompanied by Muppets wearing African masks.

EPISODE 15: Lesley Ann Warren. The Great Gonzo rides his motorcycle up a ramp into Statler and Waldorf's theater box. Warren performs a ""Beasty and the Beaut"" ballet with Doglion. Miss Piggy takes over the Swinetrek.

EPISODE 16: Danny Kaye. Some strange sights: The Swedish Chef with a human partner (Kaye, who refers to the chef as ""Tom"") and Statler and Waldorf out of their box (disgusted with the show, they head out to the back alley).

EPISODE 17: Spike Milligan. Note my byline and you'll understand why I love this one. It includes a group performance of ""It's a Small World"" on a set that bears a remarkable resemblance to a certain Disney attraction.

EPISODE 18: Leslie Uggams. A great guest appearance from Big Bird from Sesame Street. In one skit, it's love at first sight for Gonzo when Big Bird wanders onstage. ""Wow! Perfection incarnate!"" the chicken lover exclaims as he spots the giant feathered fellow. ""Statuesque, yet still poultry in every sense!"" There's also a funny MuppetLabs skit about fireproof paper.

EPISODE 19: Elke Sommer. One of the weaker episodes, this is another one that just doesn't age well. The one-time sex symbol performs ""Animal Crackers in My Soup"" and, dressed as Cleopatra, ""Row, Row, Row.""

EPISODE 20: Sylvester Stallone. Again not my favorite, but there is one memorable skit: in a gladiator sketch, Stallone and a full-size lion perform ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off.""

EPISODE 21: Roger Miller. Lots of music. Penguins on the Mayflower sing ""Alabamy Bound,"" Miller joins some watermelons for ""In the Summertime,"" Miller and a Whatnots trio do ""Hat,"" Muppets in a pub perform ""Down at the Old Bull and Bush,"" Rowlf plays ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" (and turns into a chicken) and Miller joins some Muppet chickens for a medley of ""You Had a Do Wacka Do,"" ""Dang Me,"" ""My Uncle Used to Love Me But She Died"" and ""You Can't Rollerskate in a Buffalo Herd.""

EPISODE 22: Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. A herd of cows goes mad for Fozzie's cow jokes in this cowboy-themed episode (Fozzie: ""You cows are an udder delight!). Prairie dogs sing ""Blue Skies,"" Roy and Dale perform ""Skyball Paint,"" ""Deep in the Heart of Texas"" and a medley of ""Hazy Mountains,"" ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" and ""Happy Trails.""

EPISODE 23: Lynn Redgrave. Veering away from the variety-show format, this episode is a 25-minute Muppet production of ""Robin Hood,"" with Kermit as Robin, Redgrave as Maid Marian, Fozzie as Little John and Gonzo as the Sheriff of Nottingham. The Town Crier declares ""Five o'clock and all's well! Except that Maid Marian has been kidnapped, the Sheriff's up to no good, that dog is stealing the cheese, Kermit's mad at Piggy, and it's really only 4:30.""

EPISODE 24: Cheryl Ladd. Skits include Miss Piggy and Ladd trashing their dressing room as they sing ""I Enjoy Being a Girl."" In ""Pigs in Space,"" Dr. Strangepork invents a pill that makes pigs invisible.

Bonus features include ""The Muppets on Puppets,"" a 60-minute documentary from 1968. Jim Henson, Rowlf the Dog and Muppet design chief Don Sahlin demonstrate how to build and operate a hand puppet and review the various types of puppets as well as the history of the art and its use of special effects. The DVD set also includes a new featurette, ""The Making of The Muppets.""

As before, the menu screens are live-action. On one, Miss Piggy advises you to ""only watch the scenes with me. Trust me, some of the other stuff is just plain weird!""

On the front of the box, Fozzie's fur is not only very orange (more so than indicated on the image above), it's fuzzy.",1202083200,320,8885,5.048497267759563

""The Muppet Show - Season Three"" DVD Features:
* 24 episodes of ""The Muppet Show"" - The complete third season with digitally restored picture and sound!
* Muppets on Puppets
In June of 1968, Jim Henson, Frank Oz, Jerry Juhl and Don Sahlin traveled to Hershey, Pennsylvania to tape a program about puppetry at the studios of public television station WITF-TV. This show, ""Muppets on Puppets"" aired on NET (National Educational Television - the precursor to PBS) in most areas in 1970. This rarely seen one-hour program, hosted by Jim Henson and Rowlf the Dog, is a unique opportunity to see the creators of the Muppets in their early days as puppeteers.

* ""A Frog Is Born"" - An all-new featurette exploring the origins of Kermit the Frog and his relationship with creator, Jim Henson.
* A Company of Players
An intimate look behind the scenes with the puppeteers. This original featurette includes all-new interviews with Martin Baker, Bill Barretta, Kevin Clash, Bonnie Erickson, Karen Falk, Michael K. Frith, Amy van Gilder, Dave Goelz, Jane Gootnick, Jerry Juhl, Brian Henson, Kathy Mullen, and Steve Whitmire.

* Muppet Commercials
Rowlf the Dog made his television debut in these rare commercials produced for Purina Dog Chow between 1962 and 1963. Rowlf went on to become a national star on ""The Jimmy Dean Show"" (1963-1966) before settling into his role as the resident piano-playing hound dog on ""The Muppet Show"". His sidekick in these spots, Baskerville, also was occasionally seen on ""The Muppet Show"" as well. Four original commercials are presented here

As Henson always hoped, the Muppets are a source of fun and entertainment for adults as well as children.

3336555,5,B0013527I4,"The mayhem and fun of The Muppet Show is back for season three.  And the laughs and jokes are just as plentiful as ever.

In case you have miss the fun that is this show, The Muppet Show was created during the late 70's and the early 80's, the era of the variety show.  And that's exactly what you get here.  The big difference is that the normal stars of the show are The Muppets, big puppets.  Each episodes features one or two human guest stars.  Depending on the star and the episode, some do more than others.  But most of the show is carried by The Muppets.

The show tends to shift between the acts on stage and various antics backstage, where emcee Kermit the Frog is trying to keep everything running smoothly.  Unfortunately, the rest of the cast doesn't keep things easy for him.  There's Miss Piggy, who thinks she should be the star and resents new female pig Annie Sue.  Fozzie Bear tries to come up with a funny act, only to continue to fail.  Speaking of failing, there's Gonzo who tries to do the impossible and finds out that, well, it's impossible.

Several sketches pop up multiple times over the course of the season.  The most frequent is Pigs in Space, a Star Trek spoof with hilarious results.  My favorite is the less frequently scene Veterinarian's Hospital.  That show puts the pun in anything over and over again.  There's Muppet Labs, where Dr. Honeydew and his assistant Beaker show off the latest and greatest inventions.  Okay, the latest inventions anyway.  We get treated to the latest breaking news and some of the weirdest sports you've ever seen.  And we also find out the Swedish Chef's real language (hint, it isn't faux Swedish).

And there are the guest stars.  Since these episodes are from 1978, many of them are no longer household names.  I was left scratching my head at the likes of Leo Sayer or Elke Sommers.  However, others I did know like Lesley Ann Warren, Helen Reddy, or Sylvester Stallone.  Quite often, if I know the guest star before the show, I find the jokes funnier.  That's not always the case, however, because I found the episode with Irish comedian Spike Milligan, a man I'd never heard of before, to be one of the funniest.

The show takes a few liberties with the format in this season.  They do one complete episode at a train station (while the theater is being fumigated).  In the Lynn Redgrave episode, they put on a production of Robin Hood.  One episode features a salute to all the countries that air the show.  That one ends with a spot on production of ""It's a Small World"" that even had this fan of the song and ride laughing.  These types of things keep the show entertaining.

Not that they need the help.  This show continues to put out some of the funniest stuff, even all these years later.  Okay, it does help if you are a fan of the silly.  Some of what happens is downright strange.  But if you can get into the right mindset, you'll be laughing your head off.  And if you can't?  Well, there are always Statler and Waldorf, the two gentlemen in the balcony who constantly heckle and put down the show.  I'm sure you'll agree with their comments.  (Or you can be like me.  I love their heckling even if I've enjoyed the act we just saw.)

Because this is a variety show, you'll find they don't just do comedy sketched but also include music and dancing.  Some of these are played for laughs (Harry Belafonte gets one of the funniest songs of the season), while others are played straight, like when Liberace guest stars.  Occasionally, I find that the songs slow things down, but I usually enjoy these more mellow interludes.

There were 24 episodes in season three, and all of them are here on four discs.  The last disc in the set includes an hour long presentation on puppets and how they create and perform as the Muppets, a few commercials that predate the show, and interviews with some of the Muppeteers talking about their time on the show.

All in all, The Muppet Show continues to entertain with its third season.  Now that I'm finally caught up, I hope they release a new set very soon.",1430784000,,4081,4.494550408719346

If you are considering it for someone who likes the Muppets, they don't already own it, and you have the money, but it. If you are on the fence about the Muppets, you might watch some of their material elsewhere before going all out and getting this (unless there is a really good sale); once you have done that, you'll fall under the first condition. If you don't like the Muppets I am not sure we can be friends, I realize the Muppets are not for everybody, but neither am I.",1402012800,8,628,4.241666666666666

This brought back a lot of memories especially my favorites, ""The Swedish Chef"", ""Pigs in Space"" with Link Hearthrob, the Professor and Beaker. It also reminded my of the passage of time as most if not all of the guest appearances are by performers who are no longer with us. Upside is that I got to see these wonderful people in their prime and how much joy they brought to the world of entertainment. So if you would like to take a trip down to an earlier time in your life to see some of your favorite but wonderful ""adult"" muppet characters plus the performers who made entertainment history as you would like to remember them, I recommend this set.",1395532800,2,726,4.345588235294118

Bonus material: Altough video quality is very high, you'll notice audio skips and mutes from time to time. Even I have seen copies of the rare 1968 documentary ""Muppets on Puppets"" with full audio. The master original must have been damaged. But that's the only down point.
Then we have a set of vintage 1960s Purina Dog Chow commercials, with Rowlf and Baskerville, that are a treat to see, altough very short, and a featurette by the name of "" A Company of Players "", with interviews and such. Very interesting.

The Muppet Show was my first favorite television program and will forever be associated with great memories of hanging out with my parents, just laughing and having a good time.  My immediate memories of the show were hazy from time, but I was really surprised at how much of this stuff I remembered and the overwhelming sense of familiarity I have with the show.  It's like seeing an old friend after years apart and not missing a beat -- there's no need to catch up because everything that was once there still is!

So funny, so creative, so groundbreaking, so great.

I highly recommend checking out these DVD sets.  If you are unfamiliar with the series, you will certainly be pleased.  And if it's been awhile since you last checked in with the Muppets, your old friends are just as great as you remember.

If you remember when the first show came out you'll want this. Each episode contains something you've never seen before, a sketch that was only aired in the UK version. That's right, there were 2 different versions of each episode, the US version would have one musical number while the UK version would have a completely different one. The sound and picture is clear and if you look close you might spot the very rare top of the head or mysterious third arm coming in to frame.

For those new to the Muppets this is a treat. These are the origonal Muppeteers, the late Jim Henson and Richard Hunt and the pretty much retired Frank Oz and Jerry Nelson, Dave Goelz and Steve Whitmere round out the key cast along with Louise Gold and perhaps even a young Brian Henson throwing penguins.

Don't worry about letting young viewers watch, this is true family friendly entertainment. On the season 3 set you even get a rare and wonderful look at how puppets work. This should spark many a curious mind and get many new Muppeteers off and running. Some of their performers, Richard Hunt and Bill Baretta to name a few, started off as fans and became members of the family.",1213833600,4,1408,4.513725490196078

This was a marvelous collection of the third season of The Muppet Show.  Many bright stars of the time are on here.  The only thing I wish would be added - maybe to the next couple of seasons is that there would be a brief biography of the guest.  Sometimes I don't know who they are or what they were famous for and the show only shows a brief look at their talents - many times expanding out of their known talents.

Please release the Final Two Seasons of The Muppet Show!,1212969600,,360,4.578125
3336774,4,B0013527I4,"Season 3 of the Muppet Show is one I have been waiting for a long time.  Most of these episodes are one I haven't seen, and I enjoying watching them for the first time.  I love the Harry Belafonte episode more that ever before.

A few things make me rate this set 4 out of 5 stars.

First, as others have noticed, no Muppet Morsels.  The First season DVD was awesome because it gave some behind the scenes information that Muppet fans really want to know about.  And I thought that since it was in the first season it would continue through the rest of the series.  Sadly, it's missing in Seasons 2 AND 3.

Second, the 10 minute mini-documentary ""Company of Players"" is just too short!  It looked like there was a lot of footage taken from the old Muppet performers in interviews, and I could easily see that this could have stretched out at least an hour.  Again, Muppet fans want to see and hear what it was like during the zany times on the show.

And thirdly - and this is technical issue - It seems that on my copy of the DVD, that the second disk was authored incorrectly.  Anytime I go the ""Episode Selection"" screen and choose Helen Reddy's episode, Alice Cooper's starts instead.  The only way I could watch the Helen Reddy episode is to ""Play All"" and skip all the scenes until her episode started.

Overall, this season of the Muppet is the best in video and audio quality, and is definitely worth picking up.  If a few things could be added, this would have been a 5 star pick.

But because of the aforementioned concerns, I give it 4 out 5 stars.",1212019200,4,1559,4.324137931034483
3336775,5,B0013527I4,"his set marks the third of five seasons that will hopefully all come to DVD soon. After watching the first three seasons, it only serves to remind me how great this show was and how today's families are fortunate for the opportunity to see this kind of quality and creativity today.

Genius is a word commonly attributed to Jim Henson, as well as some of his longtime collaborators, such as Frank Oz and Jerry Nelson, but the show itself is an ingenious concoction as well. Under the guise of constant self-deprecation, it is actually a meticulously crafted blend of vaudeville, TV variety and satire that constantly reflects within itself with a sharp irony much like that which is attributed to David Letterman and Conan O'Brien. It's a variety show that sends up variety shows.

In the first season DVD set, you could trace the development of the characters, particularly Miss Piggy. She went from being a chorus girl (often with differing voices) to a major international star. I'll never forget when Siskel and Ebert went into a lengthy debate about her performance in The Great Muppet Caper, before catching themselves in the absurdity of it all (""Can you believe we're talking about a piece of foam with more depth than many flesh and blood actors performing today?"")

By season three, the show had found its identity and gained the kind of clout and chic that attracted the ""in"" celebrities of the day (Gilda Radner, for example). Ironically, some of these guest stars are the most dated aspects of the series. The bizarre, unpredictable style of a series at its peak is very much in evidence. The Loretta Lynn episode takes place in a railroad station, the Marisa Berenson show features the ""wedding"" of Kermit and Piggy, and the Lynn Redgrave show is an original musical version of ""Robin Hood.""

For fans of ""Muppet*Vision 3-D"" at the Disney parks, there are echoes in the Spike Milligan episode (which has a ""Small World"" finale) and the masterful show with Pearl Bailey that randomly combines Broadway show tunes with reckless abandon.

Not much in the way of extras, though the ""Muppets on Puppets,"" a black and white documentary created for public TV in 1968, is a treat. A sweet new documentary short, ""The Making of The Muppets,"" is just that, sweet but short. It would have been nice to have more of those pop-ups that added so much inside info to the Season One set -- not that I'm complaining, though, I'm just glad to have this show on DVD and love sharing it with the kids.",1212019200,,2495,4.73963133640553
3336776,4,B0013527I4,"Growing up Muppet-style wasn't a choice, it was mandatory! From corny jokes and wild band members (Animal was my favorite), to grumpy old men booing in the balcony and listening to singing, dancing, and the acting talent of the day, The Muppet Show still holds nostalgic sway for those of us who grew up watching Jim Henson's puppeted cadre. Season three started off with a bang as singer Rita Coolridge graced the show with her amazing voice and actor Kris Kristofferson decided to rough-up a few of the cast. The show really got blazing, though, during episode four when Gilda Radner took a liking to Kermit, much to the chagrin (and karate chop) of Miss Piggy. But the Muppet brigade took a stunning jolt in episode seven when Alice Cooper was the guest star. Playing with the Muppet band, Alice took the show to a whole new level, showing U.S. audiences that puppets can be topical (and controversial?). It was then that The Muppet Show really started to take wing. Actors, musicians, and many other Hollywood talents began showing up in season three. From the voluptuous Rachel Welch and exceptionally talented Harry Bellafonte, to muscle man Sly Stallone and blonde bombshell Cheryl Ladd, the show gained notoriety from new quarters.

The amazing thing about The Muppet Show is that kids and adults can both enjoy it, but on totally different levels. Kids will probably like the physical comedy (watching Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker blow up the lab, or having a dog operate in an episode of Animal Hospital, ""A show that has gone to the dogs."") while adults will be amazed at the interspecies attractions between the likes of Kermit and Miss Piggy, or Gonzo (whatever he is) and his chickens (note the plural there; was he a polygamist?)

No mention of The Muppet Show would be complete without noting the supporting cast. Two favorites tend to be Waldorf and Statler, the old hecklers that are perched in the balcony and heave insults and boos at the cast. My other personal favorite is Sam the Eagle (so overly-pompous).

Digitally remastered just like seasons one and two, the sound and visual qualities on most HD TVs is quite nice but still iffy in places. If you don't have an HDTV, you'll probably still enjoy it, but I'd recommend seeing it in all its digitally intended glory.

This latest release has some interesting packaging that I should mention. The cover-image of Fozzie actually has a soft texture that resembles his fur. Animal packaging? And there are some cool extra features, too:

""Muppets on Puppets"" is a sixty-minute feature. Hosted by Jim Henson, it looks at the early formation of the Muppets. A rare feature that appeared first in 1969. Great Muppet history for those that want to be ""in-the-know.""

""A Company of Players"" is a behind the scenes look at the puppeteers. The fascinating work of master puppeteers comes to light. For those that don't want the magic spoiled, you might want to pass on this one.

""Muppets Commercials"" are a couple of Purina Dog Chow commercials that are hysterically funny.

A Trailer for Disney's upcoming release ""Wall-E"" and an advertisement for the new 2-Disc and Blu-Ray editions of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas.""

The Muppet Show ran for five years (1976 through 1980) and here in season three they were hitting an incredibly smooth stride. All the cast, crew, and guests appeared relaxed and to have enjoyed themselves immensely. The Alice Cooper episode is a must see, at the very least. Unfortunately there is no Blu-Ray disc release of any of the series, but I have a feeling they're coming. And if they don't come out in the near future, I'm gonna send out Miss Piggy to find out why.
