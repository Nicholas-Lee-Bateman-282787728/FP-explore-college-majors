8285093,3,B001BXL2HU,The movie would appear to have been written and produced by its principal character played by Richard Archer. Interesting to discover it was shot not more than 25 miles from my home. If the intent was to make the viewer feel uncomfortable the movie succeeds. Somehow the transition from star jock to failed alcoholic philanderer seems missing. It gets hinted at or supplied in bits and snippets. Once more the importance of parental support and re-enforcement comes to the fore. At times the acting seems extremely weak as if the characters were reading their lines off a teleprompter unrehearsed. Theres a definite amateurish feel to the piece. Most of the characters are played by people with no acting experience.,1398038400,2,716,5.025210084033613

8285096,1,B001BXL2HU,"Extremely over dramatized. Richard Archer and the rest of the cast may have talent but simply tried too hard for emotional hardness. Almost like the Chinese actor--good plot, too much forced emotion which was obvious and overplayed to the point of cliche, I see talent in some of these actors and hope they improve. Really liked the story line--music didn't match the setting though. Just my opinion but I think if Archer and the rest had softened the emotional drive it would have hit home in the genre of American Beauty. Great story that was overplayed.",1351209600,,556,4.802083333333333
