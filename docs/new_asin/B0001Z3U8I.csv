8018816,4,B0001Z3U8I,"Much like RACE WITH THE DEVIL this modest little horror flick is full of creepy performances (RG Armstrong) and surprise twists. It ain't great but it's a fine scare and well shot. If you're expecting 5-star frights, move on, but if you don't mind a tight little scary time-waster, check it out.",1278892800,3,295,4.6923076923076925
8018817,1,B0001Z3U8I,"Keeper of Souls is a terrible movie filled with non-sequiters,

bad acting and a laughable screenplay.  There are a lot of good and watchable low budget films out there, sadly this isn't one of them.  All you need to make a decent movie is to have a good camera, competant actors, lighting and a decent script.  This movie has none of those.

Stay away!!!!",1119744000,8,356,4.5
