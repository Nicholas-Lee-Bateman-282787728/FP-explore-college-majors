2417070,4,B000BGSZDC,Classic 80s farce French style. Enjoyed seeing what people thought was funny as much as the jokes themselves.,1405555200,,109,5.111111111111111

2417072,4,B000BGSZDC,"I became familiar with Les Bronzes movies (I know there are at least three), but I hadn't seen one yet.  This was funny, a bit silly, but cute.  I liked it.",1394755200,,156,4.0
2417073,5,B000BGSZDC,A classic must-see French comedy featuring a star studded French comedy cast. Nonstop laughs. Definitely worth your time to watch.,1392854400,,130,5.55
2417074,5,B000BGSZDC,A hilarious ski weekend.  Even funnier than when I saw it originally more than 20 years ago.  The subtitles help for the non-French speaker but much of the humor does not translate.,1390435200,,181,4.625
2417075,3,B000BGSZDC,"A group of French skiers at a ski resort get into all sorts of comical situations with each other. Site gags and stupid guy humor reigns. The subtitles go very fast so it is difficult to watch. Had no idea, you could talk so fast in French. All in all, the acting was good and it was a guilty peasure to watch.",1389916800,2,310,4.016129032258065
2417076,4,B000BGSZDC,"Follow up to Les Bronzes
Some very funny bits as this ski resort film spoofs contemporary French society of the late 1970s.",1389830400,,123,4.636363636363637
2417087,4,B000BGSZDC,"Enjoyed this one, have watched before,  French with English subtitles, Les Bronzes is a French Troupe of Comic actors
have several movies, hope they get more of them.  This is a Very Funny Movie",1389484800,,194,4.676470588235294
2417088,5,B000BGSZDC,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time !!! I'm French so I might be partial, especially because it's 1,000 times funnier in French. But my american friends also enjoyed it a lot.",1376179200,,185,4.314285714285714
2417089,4,B000BGSZDC,I love the French humor! Great funny movie with awesome cast. I think my American husband didn't love it as much as me (I am French) but he still had a good time. Translation isn't perfect but it is hard to translate play on words... Worth watching!,1373846400,,249,4.319148936170213
2417090,5,B000BGSZDC,"awesome movie. the whole crew is brilliant, and Val D'isere is where i used to ski so it's a plus.",1363219200,,98,3.95
2417091,2,B000BGSZDC,"this is apparently a classic in France, but there are much better French farces, especially those by francis veber, such as the dinner game",1353888000,,139,4.833333333333333
2417092,3,B000BGSZDC,"I'm confused about the other reviews, because this movie DID have English subtitles. It's '70s humor, pretty dated and cheesy, but fun for a shot of French pop culture. If you're interested in France, ""Les Bronzs"" is essential to your cultural literacy. I hope the original ""Les Bronzs"" becomes available in the U.S. -- this one is the sequel.

I can't believe this is the same director who made the brilliant ""Ridicule,"" but it was enjoyable to see his early hit.",1296777600,3,464,4.728395061728395
2417093,2,B000BGSZDC,"All in all a great movie...... If I understood what they were saying. I speak French ok, but was hoping to get subtitles. You will NOT find subtitles. Disregard what other reviews you have read.",1279152000,,194,4.571428571428571
2417094,5,B000BGSZDC,"A lighthearted and silly comedy, with a few scenes that will have you crying with laughter.  The thing I like about this type of comedy is that it's slapstick in style, but there's nothing unrealistic or outlandish to take you out of the movie.  Just a lot of funny characters and situations, set in snow.

P.S.- They must have updated the format, because there ARE English subtitles.",1268438400,3,384,4.701492537313433
2417095,1,B000BGSZDC,"When I pruchased this DVD the description made no indication that it was in any particular language, but it did indicate that the DVD format type was compatible in Canada and the US.  Yes, I knew it was a French film.  However, given it was of a format for the North American market I made the presumption it at least had subtitles.  It doesn't.

Since there is an option in the description profile to input the language, it is reasonable to expect the seller to advise the user of the language in the film and whether there are subtitles.

Even in light of their poor description of this item the seller was not cooperative on a return.",1264464000,,637,4.410256410256411
2417096,5,B000BGSZDC,"DON'T pay for the download version on Amazon Unbox, it is only a 60 second clip, NOT the movie!!!",1215388800,4,97,4.157894736842105

8086650,5,B000BGSZDC,Great movie,1454544000,,11,5.0
8086651,5,B000BGSZDC,"This French slapstick comedy from 1979 is both very funny and a showcase for some future stars.  Most striking is Thierry Lhermitte, perhaps best-known these days for his brilliant performance in the Dinner Game (Le Diner de Cons) and one of the finest French comic actors of all time.  He gets such low-profile billing in the credits for this film -- despite being on screen for virtually the entire movie -- that he must have been virtually unknown at the time it was made.  It's worth watching for him alone but the other cast members and the director, Patrice Leconte, all do their share, too.  (Leconte went on to direct many fine films.)  Highly recommended.",1454198400,,664,4.739130434782608
8086652,3,B000BGSZDC,"amusing-especially if you've gone skiing in the French alps--then the venues and characters will all seem familiar. The clueless horny guy, the scheming ski instructor, bimbos and so forth.",1454198400,,189,5.551724137931035
