8388502,4,B0034PHWM2,"The lead male and female actors have the gift, and carry the movie. The rest of the actors are not that great.

Having noted that, the story is very basic, but worth watching. The title of the movie really doesn't set you up for what it's all about. It's a poorly chosen name. I gave it fours stars for the acting. The special effects are average, but not needed that much. The female (alien) character has very good makeup, and the actress makes it all work.

There is no happy ending, but aren't you getting tired of that in the movies anyway? There's a slight plot twist at the end, but the ending is realistic.

I can imagine a TV show with these two characters going off on adventures together week after week. They work well together.",1374883200,,740,4.386861313868613
8388503,4,B0034PHWM2,"Despite some reviewers knocking this movie, I think it needs more considerations.  Basically the movie suffers from low budget and too much ""network"" influence.  This was a made for SciFi channel movie.  While there is some uneven acting, much of it is quite acceptable.  The direction is fine and the more difficult aspects of this story are complicated by the fact that one of the main actors is confined to a space suite and the other is in full alien makeup.  This would be tough for any production.

Far from being the worst movie ever this movie attempts a high degree of production value on a slim budget.  The original production name for this movie was ""The Suit"" and it is clear that the name ""Battle Planet"" was assigned by the network.  This isn't about battles and war and action.  It is about characters discovering things about themselves.

If your expecting some Star Wars rip off look else where, but if you want a more thoughtful character story this may be for you.

Yes, this movie has flaws, but if you are willing to give some young actors an opportunity at a different sort of science fiction film you might like it.",1373068800,,1139,4.589108910891089
8388504,3,B0034PHWM2,"""Battle Planet"" is an okay sci-fi action flick. I think Zack Ward is pretty good in this and I wouldn't mind seeing him star in more movies.",1365984000,,140,4.222222222222222
8388505,3,B0034PHWM2,"If you are board and nothing else on TV this is a movie for you. It was kind of lame but had a good story line.
I didn't like the ending but over all it was worth the watch.",1362096000,,173,3.4615384615384617
8388506,5,B0034PHWM2,"This item arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  I love this quirky flick, and was so glad I could finally get my hands on it.  Thank you!!!",1359331200,,146,4.37037037037037
8388507,1,B0034PHWM2,"This movie has not one redeeming quality. Not one. Terrible acting, awful storyline, laughable 'special effects' and even the music is awful.

I wouldn't recommend buying this even if it was 10 cents. Not worth 10 seconds of anyone's time. Whoever directed it and filmed it should seriously be considering another career.",1288742400,,321,5.173076923076923
