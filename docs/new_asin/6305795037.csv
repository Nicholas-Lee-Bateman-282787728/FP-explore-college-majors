1071712,5,6305795037,"this is bad, shows what women must do in order to survive in the streets, also lets us know as black people are at in these days, and times, reality, there are few black men these days, so the woman has to step forth and be the boss, shows how women are mistreated by black men-like when dude came in and beat that woman and the bruises were shown, or when dude got mad-and shot his girlfriend, this is the reason why so many black women are hating black men, whites want to see us kill each other, see our men in jail, and our women sell our souls on the streets- these women have become prostitutes, drug dealers, drug users, porn stars, thieves, hell anything to get by-i can tell champagne didn't really enjoy the porn industry-makes you think is the money worth all that, this is urban drama-that tells us all as black people that we should wake up, or others like myself get another message that we cannot be saved-and wer'e all headed for doom.",1001116800,6,951,4.348314606741573
1071713,5,6305795037,"This was the first Harry Davis film I had ever seen and it was just great. I especially enjoyed Shaka Don, she is the mosy genuine in my eyes. I really liked that the women got something from them either selling drugs,  or their ass. Its a shame that us women have to do those things. Atleast  Champagne got a nice house, even if it was doing that. She is still  maintaining with her young daughter. Some women do that and forget about  their children. I recommend this film to everyone.  I applaud Harry Davis  & Associates for their insights and await another original project.",963532800,9,579,4.466666666666667

7894732,5,6305795037,"I've been blessed to see many of his projects and this was what started it all!

He has a deep love for showing a woman's strength and in this documentary it is evident to see what some real women ahve to do to stay alive, to better themselves, to succeed...given their circumstances and environment.

Not your average documentary.
Gritty, grimey, glorious...GANGSTRESSES!",1271116800,,372,5.081967213114754
7894733,5,6305795037,"a wonderful movie about woman and all of their struggles. an excellent movie that i would recommend to all women. touches on hustling, stripping, stealing, pregnancy, etc.",1251676800,,171,5.37037037037037
7894734,3,6305795037,"OMG! OR maybe I shouldnt say that.  I agree with another member Tony Lewis ..if it would have been about hoes then yeah...it was great...I think it started off in the right direction but somewhere along the way the camera man kinda got sidetracked and it turned into straight porn.  How to make a porn movie and ""Champagne"" and all her glasses...whatever..became the focus.  It was hilarious.  It became a documentary about the life a a shake dancer.  The only true down Gangstress up in there was Shaka Don.  Why didn't he just feature her and the taxi cab trick.  They were gangstresses.  By going after them he could have hooked himself up with a lot other true Gangstresses.  Next time just do Shaka Don Gangstresses at Large!",1132876800,3,730,4.640625
7894735,5,6305795037,"This video shows how females operate in the drug game. It also shows how hookers and female adult entertainers earn their bread. Mary J. Blige and Lil' Kim have cameos in this video. So does Az, Tupac Shakur, and Russell Simmons. While Mary makes the claim that she is a gangstress, she is in a different league.",1020988800,,312,4.491228070175438
7894736,3,6305795037,"...this film should have actually been called ""Hoes"", because that's what most of the women in this film can be perceived to be. There was only one girl in this film whom I'd actually label a ""Gangstress"" (the blonde with the gun and the fur coat). Maybe if this were called ""Hoes"", I might be able to rate it higher.
If the price is right for you, it might be worth a look. I got mine for free, so the price was definitely right.",1009324800,3,430,4.130952380952381
