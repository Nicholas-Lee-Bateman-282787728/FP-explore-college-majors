The best dvd's to own if you're a Marx fan are The Marx Brothers Collection by Warner Home Videos with 7 movies, and The Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection with 5 Newly restored movies + Special features.by Universal Pictures.",1523059200,,309,4.849056603773585
8191745,2,B000PI3UQS,"I normally would never review a DVD set I've never watched, and I've frequently criticized other Amazon reviewers for doing this. However, this one time I think it's justified because this DVD set has the EXACT SAME TITLE as another DVD set by another company. Several years ago I bought this one by mistake.

The ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Marx-Brothers-Collection/dp/B0001HAIP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Marx Brothers Collection</a>"" by Warner Home Video includes seven complete Marx Brothers movies, including ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""A Day at the Races"". The other ""Marx Brothers Collection"" by Passport Video is an assortment of public domain odds and ends with appearances by different Marx Brothers. It has NO complete movies.

I accidentally bought the ""Passport Video"" set on another web site because the product description (put there automatically by the site, not the seller) included a quote from a review that read ""'Opera' is the prize jewel here"". Due to the confusion of two very different DVD sets with identical titles, the web site got them mixed up. I re-sold my set unopened for a fraction of what I had paid for it. (Unlike the seller I bought from, I wrote the product description myself and described the contents clearly so that bidders would not be misled like I was.)

Another flaw of the Passport Video set is that it's padded to fill more discs than necessary. All the material on the five discs could have easily fit on two discs.

Kudos to Amazon for adding the word ""Documentary"" to the product's title to help distinguish it from the other, more desirable ""Marx Brothers Collection"". The word ""documentary"" was NOT always in the title, and is not on other sites, and is not on the package itself. Even a shopper in a brick-and-mortar store could pick this up and buy it expecting it to be the Warner set with the seven movies. I hope my review will help Marx Brothers fans understand which of the two ""Marx Brothers Collections"" they're buying no matter where they see it.",1420243200,3,2062,5.073746312684365
8191746,5,B000PI3UQS,"I do not buy dvds for the extras in them as I have heard people do. I'm not much on documentaries but if you enjoy the Marx Brothers, and have all their movies you still don't have it all. This collection is the best to add to your collection. There are pilots that has never been seen complete and uncut. Home movies and even radio shows. I'm glad I got it and if you like The Marx Brothers you would be glad you had it to.",1260662400,5,424,3.941860465116279
8191747,5,B000PI3UQS,"This is a great collection of seldom-seen Marx Brothers footage. TV shows, commercials, interviews, newsreels, etc. The previous edition of this set got some bad reviews for not having any complete Marx Brothers movies but those movies are available elsewhere. Any serious Marx Brothers fan or collector should be pleased to have all of this rare material in one box set.",1247184000,14,371,5.098360655737705
