4184173,5,B003RCP904,"I began watching Margaret Richard in the mid 1980s on PBS. No other instructor, in person or on tape, compares to Margaret. Her descriptions of form and the sequence of exercises are very effective. With minimal investment in light weights and a soft surface, anyone can develop muscle tone and improved strength.

There are four routines, approximately 30 minutes each, that work major muscle groups. Margaret includes back, calves, inner thighs, outer thighs, abs, upper body and glutes.  At every turn she tells you how to align your body so you don't sacrifice one body part while working another.

I've been a fan for nearly 30 years and this DVD gives me exactly the type of workout I'd hoped for.

Yeah Maggie!",1320710400,43,717,4.852459016393443
4184174,4,B003RCP904,"I used to do Margaret Richard's Body Electric years, or rather decades, ago.  I loved it, it's cheesy - but that's what makes it good for me.  Each workout is about 30 min. and there are a total of 4 on the DVD (2 from each volume).  Most of the segments are not from the show, which saddens me a little, but there are a few from the show (the show had better music).  Each workout is challenging and appropriate for beginners or more advanced students.  She is encouraging without being bossy.",1292457600,44,494,4.326086956521739

4184226,5,B003RCP904,I worked out with Margaret Richards 20 years now & love this dvd because I can work out with her when I have time. Allmuscle groups are worked.,1403654400,,143,4.142857142857143

4184228,5,B003RCP904,This is the first DVD that I have used consistently in forever.  I received it two or three weeks ago and have been doing the 30 min. segments four to five times a week.  I'm already noticing an improvement in my muscle tone.  At 50 years old this is very important to me.  The fact that there are four different segments keeps it fun and works all of the muscle groups throughout the week.  My muscles are fatigued in a good way.  It's great!,1394236800,,443,4.214285714285714
4184229,3,B003RCP904,"I am okay with this DVD.  It isn't exactly what I was hoping for. After following Margaret on PBS for so may years, this item was a bit disappointing.  Didn't really care for the format and was hoping to see more of her really good workouts.",1391385600,,241,4.217391304347826
4184230,4,B003RCP904,"Wish all Margret's videos were on DVD. I need more variety even though this one works all your muscles.
I've had this DVD for 6 years. I need a new one of her older stuff.",1390176000,,171,3.914285714285714
4184231,5,B003RCP904,"While I am working with this.  I enjoyed the Body Electric TV show much better as it was more ""fun"" and upbeat with more of a dancing thing.  The music and the background people really inspired me.
Margaret gets it right in terms of what exercises work.  I need this and I know it.
I wish I could buy DVDs of the old Body Electric series, that would be truly awesome.",1379548800,3,367,4.140845070422535

boy i was looking forward to the good music!",1373241600,4,329,4.9818181818181815
4184255,5,B003RCP904,I love Margaret Richards and the Body Electric.  There are 4 workouts so perfect for one week.  I'm getting Volumes 3 and 4 too!,1371081600,4,128,4.291666666666667
4184256,4,B003RCP904,"This DVD is Volume 1 & 2 of Margaret's All My Best series, there is also a Volume 3 & 4 available.  Each DVD is a compliation of Margaret's workouts over the years, ranging from 1990-2000.  There are four 30 minute workouts on each DVD, and each segment comes from a different workout.  I personally like this variety and find that the segments flow very well, you get a different setting, outfit, hairstyle and music for each exercise.  Margaret is best known from her Body Electric exercise show, which ran on PBS stations for a number of years.

Each 30 minute workout is designed to do either back to back on a consecutive days, or you can do two workouts together for an hour long session.  I rarely exercise for an hour anymore so I generally just do a 30 minute session.  Not all muscle groups are worked in each session though.  One session may include biceps, back, hamstrings, buns and quadriceps, while the next one includes triceps, chest, shoulders, inner and outer thighs, abs and calves.  So in order to get a complete workout you need to do two sessions together or one session one day and the other the next day.  Each volume works the muscle groups entirely, it's your choice whether to split it up or not.

Margaret's style of weight training is high rep low weight.  Her workouts are not easy but have almost a calming effect, she also works as a slower pace than some trainers which I appreciate.  Not everyone wants to workout at a breakneck pace.  She also offers good form tips and suggestions, her workouts are great for strong muscles and bones without damaging your joints which I appreciate as I age.  While she does some standing work for the lower body, it mostly floor work which is nice for a change of pace.  Her floor work is tough, she is known for a lot of reps and while they are done at a slower pace you really feel it.  I personally prefer the slower pace of the floor work.  I have done faster paced floor work in the past and I find it hard to keep decent form at that speed.  So this works better for me.  Again light weights are appropriate here, I use a range of 3-8 pound weights, I also have ankle weights handy for floor work but you don't necessarily need them.  The floor work can be tough enough without them.

I really like Margaret as an instructor, she may not be as hip as some other trainers of today but I like and appreciate her calm style.  And there are days that I need calm so these workouts are right up my alley.  Some may find her more serious but I find her funny at times, she has a goofy sense of humor which comes through on these workouts.

I have tried all sorts of exercise videos over the years, and a variety of instructors.  While my collection today isn't that large, I have quite a variety of styles and instructors ranging from The Firm to Denise Austin to Margaret Richard.  I appreciate the variety that they all bring.  Margaret is great for hi rep lower weight endurance training, I also enjoy Jari Love for this kind of training, their styles are completely different but for me complement one another nicely.

Overall, if you are interested in trying Margaret out, these DVDs are your best bet because you can see a lot of what she has to offer.  I like the variety of these All My Best volumes so I find that these are all the Margaret that I need.  And you get 2 hours of content for each DVD which is nice.

I give this workout 4.5 stars, I would recommend it along with Volume 3 & 4 of All My Best.",1367712000,16,3486,4.340030911901082
4184257,5,B003RCP904,"Margaret Richard's Body Electric was my favorite morning workout, our local broadcast quit showing it, and I had not found an enjoyable replacement until I found these DVD's at a great price! Brenda",1367020800,3,198,5.03030303030303
4184258,5,B003RCP904,Was always a fan of Margaret Richard and missed her TV show.  Bought this tape and was completely satisfied.  Margaret is the only exercise video I actually enjoy working out to and it is the only video that actually brings results!  Love this video and would recommend it to others!,1357084800,4,283,4.62
4184259,5,B003RCP904,I have been a fan and student of Margarer Richards for years.  Her workouts can be done for ten minutes or for 30 minutes and whenever you have time.  The results are wonderful in increased energy and small clothes sizes.,1356220800,,221,4.5
4184260,4,B003RCP904,We're toning up already after just a couple of weeks with Margaret.  She makes these toning exercises easy to follow with varying degrees of difficulty for all levels of fitness.,1355529600,,178,4.933333333333334
4184261,5,B003RCP904,"This DVD is perfect for me because I have watched and recorded a lot of Body Electric programs on my VHS tapes.  Now that it is broken and my tapes were ""eaten"" by my VHS recorder, this DVD has very good exerpts from a lot of Margaret Richard's programs.  It works all the major muscle groups.  It couldn't get any better.",1352419200,,322,4.245901639344262

4184263,5,B003RCP904,"I used to exercise with her on Body Electric years ago and I taped the shows. There was another one that came on after with a blong lady [i forgot the name] and I taped that one also. I just located it and copied the VHS to a DVD and i am going to begin exercising again. I, too, loved the music. Thanks for this show.",1344211200,3,318,3.8333333333333335
4184264,5,B003RCP904,"I used to watch her show ""Body Electric"" in the 1990's and I remember seeing and feeling results in a matter of weeks.  In an age of pilates, p90x, Zumba, and the other trendy workouts,  Richards friendly, accessible, simple to follow routines are a breath of fresh air!  Weight lifting for women - even light weight lifting - has fallen out of favor.  And it's a shame because its so important to supplement your yoga, pilates, elliptical machine session, Zumba class, etc. with strength training to prevent bone loss and to help prevent or manage osteoporosis.

Now that I'm off my soap box, I have to say that I enjoyed seeing the old footage mixed in with some newer footage.  I agree with another reviewer who said they were disappointed at not being able to hear the theme song from the show.  That said, I got a terrific workout.  I was sore the next day, but not so sore that I had to negotiate steps.  A little soreness to me is good. If you haven't worked out in awhile, you might even find some of the routines hard to finish, but in time you will finish and see results.",1331596800,26,1082,4.396984924623116

8403530,3,B003RCP904,"I know there are a lot of Margaret Richard fans out there who, like me, miss her daily ""Body Electric"" program on PBS. Her exercises are excellent, and she gives a lot of tips on proper technique.

That said, it's disappointing to find only about two programs' worth of material on this single-DVD purchase. At nearly $60, it is WAY overpriced. If I saw this in a store and could see what was on it, the most I would be willing to pay would be about $12. My advice: Save your money.",1472860800,5,482,4.239130434782608

they really work and she talks to you while you are working, giving info
all the time.  I made my post pregnancy body (at 40) look like a 25 year

8403538,1,B003RCP904,I love Margaret Richards....but this DVD was a real disappointment.  The bicep workout is mediocre at best.  There are no oblique exercises....
