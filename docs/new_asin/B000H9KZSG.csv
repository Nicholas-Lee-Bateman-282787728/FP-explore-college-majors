8137769,4,B000H9KZSG,"This is a solid documentary at first but becomes a little light as it goes on. There is a weird red herring about a failed love interest thing in Pol's early years in Phnom Penh (?????) but outlines the development of the KR in quite a clear form. Unfortunately, despite providing good footage throughout, the doco sort of peters out when it focuses on the prisoners of S-21 and then just winds up with the Vietnamese occupation and the flight to the jungles of Thailand, without much follow up. There are some very interesting snippets of footage of an interview with Nuon Chea, who sidesteps any accusations of mass murder etc.
Overall this is sound but a more comprehensive doco is that of Pol Pot, Secret Killer, on the Biography channel.",1405814400,,742,4.67175572519084
