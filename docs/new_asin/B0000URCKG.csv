8003343,1,B0000URCKG,"Rarely have I been so disappointed. And at nearly $30 I feel I've been robbed. If you want to play ""Jimmie Cracked Corn"" - and that's all - this may be rght for you. But if you hope to aquire any knowledge or skills that are transferable to other music/songs, buyer beware. There is nothing on this DVD that will help you develop the ability to play vocal accompaniment style piano, even on the most basic level.",1177372800,,412,4.363636363636363
8003344,4,B0000URCKG,"First off, I'd suggest that unless you've never touched a piano before, avoid Volume 1 and start here. I haven't seen it, but it's clear that Dan Huckabee reviews it all here. The downside is that you may have to spend a bit more time with each song on Vol. 2 if you're a complete novice.

 You're not going to learn any full comping arrangements here, but Huckabee's down-home style is encouraging and you'll learn a system to easily whip out a simple accompaniment to go with most popular songs in an informal setting.

Beginning pianists can use this method to gain a decent sense of how to find the major, minor and dominant 7th chords in the context of a couple of common popular progressions. If you play each song in a few keys, you'll have a good base for by-ear and lead sheet playing as well as vocal accompaniment.

The LH is as simple as can be (only roots and root-fifths), but the treatment of ""Stand By Me"" offers a few clues for increasing complexity if you're not afraid to experiment.

I'd recommend ""Beginning Rhythm Piano Volume 2"" to beginning players who want  a fun way to learn to make basic chord changes in several keys quickly and automatically. You'll learn to hear and anticipate changes, and get a taste of LH work. It might help your singing as well! You don't need to read music to learn from this DVD.",1175644800,7,1334,4.469135802469136

8003346,5,B0000URCKG,"This DVD is excellent. I had been looking for good information on piano comping (Accompanying)for years, and finally here it is on this DVD. Thanks to Dan Huckebee.",1128470400,4,164,4.892857142857143
