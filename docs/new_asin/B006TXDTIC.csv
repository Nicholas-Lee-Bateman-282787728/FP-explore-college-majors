8504233,4,B006TXDTIC,"An original component of NBC's Mystery Movie lineup, McMillan and Wife features Rock Hudson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ice-Station-Zebra/dp/B008B4KVS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ice Station Zebra</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giant/dp/B0007US7FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giant</a>) as San Francisco Police Commissioner Stuart `Mac' McMillan, and Susan Saint James (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kate-And-Allie/dp/B003476UIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kate And Allie</a>), as his wife and crime-solving partner, Sally.  This DVD contains the first two episodes from the fourth season (1974-75), where due to the real life pregnancy of Susan Saint James, Sally is also pregnant.

Each episode runs about 98 minutes, and while this release was perhaps intended as a way to ""sample"" the series, why these particular episodes were chosen, out of the 40 that were produced in the entire series' run, is a bit of a mystery, as Sally's pregnancy was certainly unusual.  It does not however, prevent her from taking an active role, as Mac continues to rely on her, as well as the slightly goofy sergeant Charles Enright (John Schuck), and his crusty housekeeper Mildred (Nancy Walker), who is never shy about offering her opinions.

Downshift to Danger (Rating: 3 stars)
Mac and Sally are members of a car club, and when the club president dies, his last wishes are that a cross country road rally event be held, to determine what will happen to his collection of valuable antique cars.  The McMillan's are one of five couples participating in the rally and vying for the prize, but unfortunately misfortune visits a number of the teams, as Mac's car is sabotaged, forcing a switch to Sally's yellow MG convertible.  As the event proceeds, more mishaps occur, culminating with the death of one of the racers.

The previous year, the McMillan's journeyed to Scotland in what was a memorable season premiere.  This season opener also has an unusual premise, where the emphasis is more on action sequences featuring the various vehicles, concluding with a wild chase, with Sally in the back of a pickup truck.

The Game of Survival (Rating: 4 stars)
This is a complicated whodunit, where the mauled remains of newspaper tycoon Ewing Webley (Andrew Duggan) are found in the cage of his pet lions.  Astrov, a tennis player who is the prime suspect has disappeared.  Webley's young wife Rachel (Stefanie Powers), and son Walter (George Maharis), don't appear overcome by grief.  The McMillan's are smack in the middle of things, having just played mixed doubles with Rachel and Astrov.  With some assistance from Enright, and a visibly pregnant Sally, Mac cleverly puts the pieces together.  Guest stars Powers and Maharis, deliver some strong performances, and for comic relief, former tennis pro Bobby Riggs makes a brief appearance at the very end.

With two episodes featuring a pregnant Sally, this release is a good representative of the fourth season of McMillan and Wife, but perhaps not the best sampling of the entire series.  The differences are not major, as the style of the program remains basically the same, but a little more diversity would seem to have made more sense.

Mixing romance, intrigue, humor, and action, McMillan and Wife was an entertaining series, which appealed to old style mystery lovers.  For the uninitiated, this release is a decent introduction to the series, but might not be the most economical buy.  The season sets which were once in the $25 range, have come down in price, and if your timing is good, you might be able to get an entire season, with six or seven episodes, for just a little more than this single DVD release.  The episodes are not subtitled, and there are some instances where image quality is not the best, due to issues with the source material.",1374883200,2,3922,5.461920529801325
8504234,5,B006TXDTIC,"Watching McMillan & Wife Double Feature was truly a blast from the past and I enjoyed it very much.  It was fun to see the fashion, the hair styles, makeup and so on. The relationship between the two of them was just as I remembered - loving and loyal. This duo crime-fighter couple had it all, didn't they?  And, Mildred, of course, is the best. So is Sergeant Enright.  I enjoyed every minute and am now up to Series 4 and will purchase the rest of the Series a little at a time.  I wanted to mention that the DVDs were delivered in 5 days which is unheard of in Hawaii, so kudos to Amazon for the great shipping. I ordered other DVDs the same day from Target and they took 5 weeks to get here.  I'm going to go now and watch another episode.....",1373068800,,748,4.13103448275862
8504235,5,B006TXDTIC,"Also, a very pregnant Susan Saint James!
For those who don't want a full season set of episodes, this 2-fer will suffice! Very enjoyable.",1372032000,,137,4.75

8504238,5,B006TXDTIC,"DOWNSHIFT TO DANGER: a priceless car collection is TOP price in a road rally. Mac and Sally enter for charity and have their borrowed race car sabotaged. Look for Scatman Crothers in a bit part as Mechanic who saves the day. The fun begins as they end up with Sally's tiny roadster as the back up car they drive. ADDED fun is watching 6 feet 4 inch Hudson barely fit in the car. This one is played for fun and the humor is good and a good mystery with someone will do anything to win including murder. Watch for Sally to help solve the crime with clues she shares with Mac from a TACKY movie magazine she is reading in bed. Lots of laughs and guest stars. added bonus is fun watching Hudson trying to get all Sally's endless suitcases into one tiny trunk~

THE GAME OF SURVIVAL: Trophy Wife Stephanie Powers does not shead a tear when geezer hubby is killed by a LION no less. Stepanie is busy mourning while get ""private lessons"" from her HUNKY tennis instructor both off and on the court.  Look for BOBBY RIGGS in a cameo at the end of the movie and look for a PREGNANT Susan St. James (Sally) and Rock Hudson playing a pretty good game of doubles tennis in this episode.

Susan St. James was really pregnant with her second child and they wrote a McMillan baby into the series. blast from the 1970s past. COMPLETE WITH hideous green shag carpet, Large HOOP earrings, PINK shirts on the guys, bell bottom pants on everyone and OH yes pay phones for a dime.",1348704000,13,1458,4.333333333333333
