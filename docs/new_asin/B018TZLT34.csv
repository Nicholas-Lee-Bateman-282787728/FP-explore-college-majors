7555582,5,B018TZLT34,"This is a number of TV shorts aimed at pre-school/ early elementary school children. The series features a white guy, a female, and an African American as builders. It includes talking vehicles, including Scoop, who typically messes things up, but all is always forgiven. The chef is creative and slightly effeminate rounding out our diverse society. No Muslims or Indians as yet.

The shorts teach diversity and friendship. What they don't teach is safety...people in a construction sight without wearing the proper protective equipment. Bob wears a harness to go to the top of a building under construction, but never ties off...i.e. what function is the harness?

I don't think it's been watched again after that. He said he doesn't like the new Bob and that he looks funny. He still watches the old Bob the Builder show and movies but he refuses to watch the new ones.",1470873600,,371,4.095890410958904
