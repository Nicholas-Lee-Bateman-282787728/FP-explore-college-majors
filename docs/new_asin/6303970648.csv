764211,1,6303970648,"Time chasers is a truly awful movie. The plot, if that is the right word, concerns a bicycle riding physics professor in Vermont named Nick, who has to pass for our hero. This guy invents a time transport as he calls it, a light plane that can travel through time. He gets involved wth Gencorp a sinister company run by J.K. Robertson, who'll have to pass for the film's villain. Nick travels into the future to prove his invention works. The future is a place where everybody rides bikes and kids dress in very bright clothes, not very futuristic at all. After selling the machine to GenCorp Nick finds that GenCorp has been using it to transport weapons.  The holier than thou Nick sets off to stop GenCorp, and eventually does but not before causing most of the audience to die of boredom.",1057017600,3,792,4.538461538461538
764290,4,6303970648,"With films like Death Ring, Wicked Games, and the Gingerdead Man under our belt it's amazing to find a film that even we say is awful. This rare occurance has taken place with our feature film Time Chasers filmed in Vermont. Now we did get a lot of help (hence the 4 star rating) from our friends over at Mystery Science Theatre 3000 which made the film watchable due to their constant hilarious coments. If it wasn't for them you'd most likely slip into a coma about 38 minutes in. Even The Final Sacrifice put this one to shame. It's so amazing that a film like this could actually be made and released into the public. Luckily for fans of the genre it was, placing in the extensive b library of Sid the Elf.

The nightmare begins with a no hit wonder by the name of Nick as he completes a time machine. Now nick rides a bike, wheres a Castleton college t-shirt, has giant rog glasses, and a mullet that would make the 83 Chuck Norris furious with envy yet is a pure genius. While he spends hours a day in front of his old Mac computer with the black screen and orange type he discovers how to go back/ahead in time. He somehow implements his b computer technology into a small 2 person airplane, and we have the time machine. As he runs a test drive he goes ahead in time 50 years where it looks no different then whatever time period he was from. Everyone looks at him like he's dressed in civil war fatigues yet he's dressed just as 80's as they are. Their portrayal of the future is beyond poor. Our guess limited budget had something to do with that, but hey it's b and we never question it.

Now that our mega nerd has returned safely he has decided to pitch the technology to the J.K. Robertson the CEO of Gen-corp (whose main henchman looks exactly like Paul Bearer.) As he explains that he has software to jump from past or future J.K becomes very interested and offers up an undisclosed amount for the technology. Now the amount couldn't have been much since his office was located in the local library, but who are we to assume? Now that J.K has the software Nick gets knowledge of him using it for evil purposes. Nick then decides to go back in time to a week before he sold it to convince himself not to sell the software. Yeah it's as confusing as it sounds. Somehow in his efforts to go back a week he winds up in 1777 to find the people dressed in 90% off Halloween bargin costumes of soldiers. From here the film jumps all over the place causing a lot of confusion and laughs. In the end Nick stops himself from selling it, goes back to the right time period, and destructs the software saving the world from J.K & Paul Bearer.

Simply one of the worst films we have ever seen but was so much fun at the same time. What you'll learn is Ben & Jerry's is the only good thing to come out of Vermont. The best thing about this film was the fact that it was released in 1994 yet looks like it's from 1985. After some research turns out the film was finished in 1990 but wasn't released til 94. No matter what time it was released it still would have about a .025% chance of being seen if it wasn't for the exposure through MST3K. Thankfully they found this one and turned it into a true gem which will provide plenty of laughs. If you have a couple hours to kill make sure you test this one out. It's a lot like Back to the Future only subtract the budget, plot, actors, and on-set buffet and add in a main character that Michael J Fox could beat the tar out of.",1229385600,2,3476,4.22406015037594
764291,3,6303970648,"This movie was filmed on a low budget in the early 90s. It's honestly not bad enough to be a great MST3K feature. At the end of the movie, I clapped a little and said ""Given the time (of production) and budget they had, they could not have made a better movie."" That's intended as a compliment. It's not a _great_ movie by any stretch, but it would have been a solid B or B- movie at the time. The effects are terrible now; at the time they would have been passable. The plot is actually solid, makes sense, and the story has a beginning and an end. You even understand why the characters do what they do. This isn't true of most cheaply-produced movies.

Worth a watch on MST3K for the plaid-on-plaid ensemble alone.",1221523200,7,717,4.311111111111111
764292,5,6303970648,"Anyone even remotely connected with the study of physics and the space-time continuum will understand the logic behind the science of the movie Time Chasers (aka Tangents).  I once had a sit down with Professor Stephen Hawking where we watched this magnum opus and upon the movies conclusion all he had to say was, ""These - peo - ple - get -it!""  Right on Steve!

The movie centers around protochin hero Nick Miller who zips around Vermont in his one prop plane which is also equipped with a Commodore 64 that has been modified to double as a flux capacitor.  And to think all the years I spent merely playing Archon on my C64 when I could have been wandering through time.  Of course, Vermont isn't just the home for the next Einstein, it's also the home of GenCorp and the evil J.K. Robertson.

To say things go horribly wrong is an understatement.  But to say you will be entertained is also a horrible understatement.  Everyone knows you watch Time Chasers for the science not for the joy of cinema done right!

So grab a notepad and get your ""learn on"" with TIME CHASERS!
Chins forward!",1213488000,4,1091,4.525510204081633
764293,4,6303970648,"Time Chasers is okay, it just happens to be really easy to make fun of.  I mean, there's the guy in the pink suit, the woman reporter wearing two different plaids, the villian with the corny voice, and several other non-ideal kinks spread out all over the place...but I've seen worse.  Much worse.

The plot centers on a guy named Nick who builds a time machine using software from a half-dozen or so old-school floppy disks that probably hold 1 megabyte of memory apiece.  (Thanks to MST3K for pointing this out.)  Okay, so we immediately see that the movie is dated.  But the whole time travel theme and the halfway decent script save Time Chasers from becoming another Manos: The Hands of Fate.

Our hero Nick is convinced nobody will believe he has built a time machine unless they see it in action first-hand, so he calls an invention company and says he's building a fuel-efficient engine to sucker a representative of the company into viewing a demonstration.  He also calls a newspaper reporter and says his 80 year old grandma is going to try skydiving for the first time.

When the reporter and invention company representative are in the plane, Nick takes them on a journey fifty years into the future.  The impressed company buys the time machine and Nick goes on a time traveling date with the female newspaper reporter.  When Nick and the reporter travel back to the future while making out, they realize that the invention company has used the time machine as a weapon and the future is ruined as a result.

The rest of the movie is mostly just Nick running around in a mud-stained Castleton t-shirt while the Revolutionary War of the 1700's is taking place.  Also, Nick's past self meets his present self, and it's all very confusing.  There's a happy ending though, and the few megabytes of time machine software are permanently deleted.  Silly, but refreshing.",1168041600,,1878,4.735384615384615

While I can't promise that the non-Mistied version will be as entertaining, I can promise you that the cheesy special effects (spirograph on an apple IIe) and ridiculous time-jumping plot will certainly make you laugh!  Then again, I have a soft spot for cheesy low budget movies that try to use the mezannine at a Vermont Community College as the office for an Executive at a powerful company!!!
Rumor has it that the makers of 'Time Chasers' were very excited to have their movie showcased on MST3K, and rightly so!",1060214400,4,618,4.609090909090909

When the movie arrived, the package included another movie--Illegal Alien--as well as a mini poster for an upcoming film, and a VHS box for Time Chasers, signed by the director, David Giancola!

This is an extraordinarily ambitious independent film and I appreciate the zeal at which the filmmakers had in creating the film.  It is low budget with big ideas.  It doesn't have the biggest budget or career film actors as stars but it has heart in abundance.,1481932800,,410,4.746478873239437

7859552,4,6303970648,"I am compelled to write this review because I think other customer reviews were far too harsh on this film.

""Time Chasers"" was shot on a miniscule budget, and stars a bunch of actors no one ever heard of. The package claims it won an award called the ""Gold Award Houston Worldfest"". I've never heard of that award either.

Despite its low budget, the story is intriguing, the performances are all good, and the pace is brisk. It's weakest aspect is its synthesized music track.

The plot is sufficiently original. It may have been influenced by other time travel and futuristic films, but it does not brazenly rip off anything.

The plot involves a young scientist named Nick who rigs up a private airplane to travel through time. He demonstrates his invention to a newspaper reporter named Lisa (who soon becomes his love interest) and to a corporate CEO named Robertson. In desperate need of money to further his time travel work, Nick sells his time-travel technology to Robertson, who soon turns out to be a ruthless, power-crazed SOB who allows various governments to use the technology for nefarious purposes.

I liked the fact that when the main characters initially travel 50 years into the future, what they find is only slightly different from their own time. It would have been too much of a cliche to have a future with robots and flying cars, and the absence of those cliches actually makes this aspect of the film more believable! (Sometimes a low budget can work in a film's favor.)

Anyhow, the relatively tranquil future the characters visit initially is significantly altered to a desolate, war-ravaged one, thanks to the reckless actions of Robertson. In order to avert this calamity, Nick and Lisa must try to obtain Nick's own time-travel plane (which is now heavily guarded) to go back in time and prevent Robertson from ever buying the time-travel technology in the first place!

""Time Chasers"" is slightly flawed, but effective. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction or suspense films.",1279411200,14,2030,4.883720930232558
