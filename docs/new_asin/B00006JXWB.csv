1782638,5,B00006JXWB,"I have tried several yoga videos before and I usually get bored with them somewhat quickly, or they go too quickly and I get lost.  This DVD has so much fantastic instruction on it and it really  changes and adapts to fit whatever my needs are for any given day.
Since I can't get into many of the more difficult yoga poses very easily, the use of  the props were very, very helpful for me.  For the first time I really feel like I am beginning to understand the benefits of these poses.  It really helped with some lower back issues I had as well.
I highly recommend it for anyone that is beginning yoga or likes a slow paced, relaxing, detailed  approach to yoga.  The only drawback is that if you like to go very quickly from pose to pose, more like an aerobics workout, then this might not be for you.  But don't get me wrong, the benefits are tremendous from this DVD!",1043712000,32,873,4.248484848484848
1782639,5,B00006JXWB,"I don't normally recommend videos to people who are new to yoga.  I've worked with several great yoga teachers over three years, and I know that it is important to have the opportunity to get feedback and advice from an experienced professional sometimes, in order to better understand the position and avoid injury.  However, if you are getting started and don't currently have time to work with a teacher, I feel comfortable recommending ""Yoga for Inflexible People"" to you.  The positions, and the movements into and out of them, are described very well on this video.  Modifications with props such as blankets, blocks, and chairs are demonstrated and explained.  The only thing I can think of that would make this DVD better would be a few minutes spent on the philosophy of yoga, and why it is counterproductive to ""push"" yourself into an uncomfortable position.  When I first began yoga, I was, like most of us, inclined to push myself to the point of discomfort and a little bit beyond in a position, because I thought that that was how to ""get better"" at it.  My teachers, however, repeatedly told me to find that place where it's uncomfortable and then ease off a little, and the exercise will actually be more productive, not to mention more pleasant.  The importance of observing how your body responds when the pressure to perform is eased a bit cannot be stressed enough.
Nothing can take the place of a qualified and experienced yoga instructor, but this DVD is an excellent place to begin until you have time to work with an instructor, and a great supplement to a class to have at home.",1041897600,806,1603,4.720430107526882
1782640,5,B00006JXWB,"This is a great DVD to learn yoga and to learn to modify the poses my not-so-flexible body can't quite do.  Modifying the poses is not cheating--it actually increases the exercise value by allowing me to do a pose at a level that pushes me but doesn't strain me. The modifications demonstrated use folded blankets, block(s)or a chair and can be learned and then applied to any yoga program.  When I did the modifications for a seated twist I felt like I was finally getting some benefit from the pose rather than just feeling twisted and uncomfortable.  This DVD is set up as a series of poses or flow series of varying lengths and with various goals (energize, calm or to work on certain body parts)and with the DVD controls I can fast forward or go back and repeat something so I can vary the lengths of the routines even more.  I think that the only thing this DVD won't do is give a very fast, very intense workout.  But it is very thorough.  And eventhough it is very gentle I feel like I've done something good for my body.",1038700800,36,1029,4.389473684210526
1782641,5,B00006JXWB,"As someone who is rather inflexible and who is beginning to explore the world of yoga, this is an incredible product!
I like to go to yoga classes, but have trouble fitting that into my schedule and following up in the weeks that pass between classes.  So I had tried yoga videos by rodney yee and others, but found them to be far too fast paced to follow along, and had pretty much given up on them..
This is completely different from regular yoga videos or videos that have been transferred to DVD.  There are sections on 1) standing poses, 2) seated poses, 3) strength and flexibility, 4) beginning basics and 5) shoulders and hips.  It is made so that you can move between these sections to customize your workout and replay sequences within sections, when you want to see it again.
There's a ton on this DVD, something like 3.5 or 4 hours altogether, and it's fun to try and do different parts on different days.
I wanted to give it 6 stars, but amazon only allows 5!",1032998400,197,972,4.418994413407821

1782657,2,B00006JXWB,"I'm an advanced beginner, and I'd say this video is well-made and the instruction very solid. Overall, though, it's the most impersonal, uninspiring DVD I've come across. The overvoice cues are so wordy that my brain won't go into that blissy yoga-mode because I'm tracking the *constant* stream of monotone instructions. The featureless setting makes me sad, and the model/teacher doesn't seem to be having much fun (and by ""fun"" I don't mean bouncy/smily fun, but just some postive energy). To be fair, I didn't stick with this video after an initial lesson or two. I much prefer Barbara Benagh's pose lessons or Zyrka Landwijt's vinyasa flow DVDs. A final note re: the title:  these typical yoga poses are no more ""inflexible people""-friendly than any others, and possibly less so than what you would be doing in a gentle flow routine.",1421452800,,838,4.943262411347518

1782659,5,B00006JXWB,This Yoga DVD is excellent.  I use it with a friend 2x a week and we both love the flexibility of being able to choose a different routine each time.  The instructions are clear and having an instructor to watch as well as listen to is very helpful for new moves. The pace is relaxed and you can choose different length routines.  It is easy to follow and we both agree that it provides a good workout even if we are short on time and choose a shorter routine.  An excellent value for the money!,1414800000,,495,4.178947368421053

1782666,5,B00006JXWB,"I went to the library and checked out all the beginner level yoga videos they had. I previewed them all. When I came across Yoga for Inflexible People I immediately went to Amazon and ordered my own copy. Now retired from too many accidents, I have been an equestrian for 38 years and polo player for 25 for those years. I have experienced my share of accidents over those many years. All reflected in my neck, spine, hips and right knee. There are 35 segments to select from so I started with the short segments. One each day. I noticed a positive difference every day. I took it slow and easy. I stuck with it every day. It has been six months now and the overall improvement has been amazing. Prior to Yoga for Inflexible People, at age 55 with all those old riding injuries, I saw the future as being a downhill road to greater pain, weight gain, and saw no possible means to change what I perceived as a bleak outlook for my future. Because of this video, everything has turned around for me. I can see a future now where I can have the balance, flexibility and strength I always desired. And, this video is the beginning of that road for me. More than that, people who have known me for years, when they see me, ask me what I am doing differently. I tell them all about this video. Most times, I go home to my computer, get on-line and order them a copy of the DVD from Amazon and have it sent as a gift.

1782683,2,B00006JXWB,"My husband and I have embarked on a fitness journey unlike anything we've done before. We decided that in addition to our sports, we want to learn yoga and tai chi. So I bought several DVDs for both. However, we found that most of the yoga DVDs assumed a physical flexibility that we currently lack...thus the need for yoga. So, I ordered this product: Yoga for Inflexible People.

Look at the photo on the cover. Really, that's how you start out Yoga for Inflexible People? I'd say this is a good yoga program, but they certainly don't start out with the understanding that some people cannot touch the ground with their hands while standing with straight legs, much less form a triangle with their body and do the pose shown. That's in the first session.

Ridiculous title. That's all I'm saying.",1362614400,3,798,4.652482269503546
1782684,5,B00006JXWB,"Warning:  If you like bouncy spandex clad instructors shouting instructions on a sunny beach with a live reggae band competing for your attention, please move on, this is not for you.  However, if you want to explore your body through yoga, this is the DVD for you.

This is hands down the best yoga DVD for beginners I have ever seen.  The programs on this DVD are organized into 6 submenus, each concentrating on a different goal.  Each submenu contains 6 routines ranging in length from 15 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes which increase in level of difficulty.

Yoga is an introspective journey into self and this is where this DVD shines above all others I have seen.  The exercises are paced VERY slowly in order to allow the beginner to experience the mind-body connection in each pose and to make small adjustments in the pose which give better understanding of how the mind and body work together.  The instructor gives very good direction on how to achieve and deepen each pose.  Her voice is very pleasant and soothing.  All of these allow the beginning student to work through the conflict between mind and body to quieten the mind while strengthening the body and allowing for greater flexibility.

Those reviewers who criticize this DVD for lack of visual appeal and boredom are missing the point.  The instructor, the background, the lack of distracting music and the deliberately slow pace are designed to help the beginner to focus inwardly on the mind-body connection, on what their bodies are doing.  Strangely enough, an analogy can be made with fashion shows.  Models are self-effacing on the runway, the focus is on the clothing, not the model.  The same is true here.  All distractions have been removed so the beginning student can focus on themselves, not the instructor, the background or the music.",1361318400,,1826,4.823151125401929

So I'm starting to try out some DVDs through my library, via inter-library loan, to discover ones worth buying. I will NOT be buying this one.

The description here made it sound like it might be good for someone like me, but the disclaimer at the beginning of the actual DVD says it's for people who are physically fit already. It may be that the ""inflexible people"" referred to in the title have been concentrating on strength or cardio training and not enough on flexibility. It doesn't seem intended for those who are inflexible because of arthritis, being overweight, or being generally out of shape. The description here also says it shows how to use common household items as props if necessary, including a belt. However, the belt shown as a prop for correct position and breathing technique is extremely long and must have been made specifically for yoga practice--not the kind you'd have around the house. You couldn't wrap a normal belt around your neck, shoulders and chest, as shown on the DVD.

On the back of the case, it says there are routines for various problems like lower back pain. But when I went to the section of the DVD for back and hip issues, the very first exercise was one that I wouldn't have been able to do even when I was younger, thinner and in better shape--and with no real adjustments given to make it a little easier for those with current back issues.

On top of that, the verbal instructions are very puzzling--how are you supposed to raise your thighs, or broaden the backs of them, let alone while you are standing still? I don't know what these instructions mean, and don't want to get in the habit of doing the poses incorrectly. Years ago I tried yoga tapes and books, and took a few classes, and never found the instructions to be as confusing as this.

The poses are arranged in groups for different aims (i.e. ""revitalizing,"" ""quieting,"" etc.)  You can mix and match, or go from one pose to the next in a set.  But it isn't a routine or a practice, with a rationale and flow from one pose to the next.  You are basically constantly interrupted by the DVD to change your pose, employ a prop, etc.  I would really appreciate an actual practice composed of poses for inflexible people, so I can really do a daily routine and build on it.",1338768000,2,582,4.452830188679245

I found going through this DVD incredibly difficult.  I am not inflexible, but I do have fibromyalgia, and by pose four I was done.  The details of the poses are, indeed, very useful, but holding the pose for as long as the teacher is speaking is difficult for many of us, and shockingly, they don't give the simplest modifications of all- for instance, doing Mountain Pose with feet separated for those of us with extra padding, or pulling the feet closer together in Warrior Pose when one's leg stabilizer muscles are weak.  The prop mods are quite useful and I daresay that this video is quite excellent, all things taken together, but I have found that I can only use it reasonably when I watch it first and then do the sequence on my own, paying more attention to what my body is asking for.",1308355200,5,1277,4.4978354978354975

There are general routines, routines for your hips & lower back, your legs, your shoulders plus others to help energize and relax you.  There is also a nice selection of time variations so you can do longer and shorter routines, so if I have only 20 minutes to work I my legs, I can find something to do.

I like the fact that it addresses things to help someone like me with the use of props.  At the beginning they tell you what props are recommended with a couple of additional bits of information, namely that many props can be substituted with things you probably already have so you do not have to run out and buy things and that the props are suggestions if you need the help.  The props used in the routines are also explained for each pose so you can be ready to use them.

I definately recommend doing what the DVD says, give a quick run through and watch things (even fast forwarding works) to get a sense of what is going to happen.  After doing it once or twice you really get the hang of the flow.

I have many of the same complaints that others have had about this DVD. I liked the idea of being able to work in segments and customize my workout, but the segments were choppy, with the narration often being cut off, started over, and rarely in sync with the movements demonstrated. The narrator uses unfamiliar terms and gives instructions without explaining what the terms mean, and the ""model"" demonstrating these moves is filmed too far away to really tell what muscles she is contracting or relaxing. The DVD does not explain beforehand what props you will need, what they are for, how to acquire them or substitute for them, etc. Until I read other reviews, I did not realize that with yoga there is also the issue of transitioning from one position/segment to the other, but this DVD definitely doesn't tell you how to do that, either.

The instruction is really well done and was easy to follow.  And as someone new to yoga, the pace and the way the DVD was laid out worked well.

1782808,5,B00006JXWB,"I started using this DVD awhile ago when it was recommended by a yoga teacher to help me progress and it has been extremely helpful.  The instruction and routines are geared specifically to people who need a bit more assistance to learn yoga.

The DVD is generally broken down into general catagories with a range of selections in each catagory.  They range from shorter/easier routines to those that are a little longer and add a few other poses.  If you are starting, definately go with some of the shorter ones, they are doable by anyone and are geared more to start getting your body used to yoga and are not anything that anyone cannot do.

The poses are also supplemented by the use of props which are helpful.  Eventually I did not get some props when I realized I was going to stick with practicing, but when I first started I used the things from around the house that is mentioned as being usuable.

Some things to make sure to do are on the DVD, as it says watch the routines before trying them because it does help.  Not needed, but I preferred watching ahead of time.",1251072000,,1080,4.446700507614213
1782809,2,B00006JXWB,"The basic format of this DVD is that they separately recorded videos of a person performing the various poses that they wanted to use, and then you can select from a number of routines that combine those poses by jumping from one video to another.  In any given pose, they do a version modified by props so that it doesn't demand as much flexibility as the poses do when done in the standard way.

The really nice thing about this arrangement is that they can offer a much greater variety of different routines than you'll see on a typical yoga DVD.  There are routines meant to increase energy, routines meant to relax you, routines that are performed entirely while seated, and so on.  It was actually the option of purely seated routines that first drew me to this DVD, as I took several yoga classes a while ago but had issues with knee pain from a previous injury that kept me from doing much of what my classes covered.  For that purpose, I liked this DVD very much because it gave me options to try to pursue yoga without the annoyance of standing around waiting for a normal video or class to get past the parts that were unsafe for me to do.

However, there are some ways in which it doesn't work out as well as a typical yoga DVD.  Because it jumps among independently made videos of different poses, you don't get to see the instructor moving from one to the next, and it's much more difficult to get into the sense of relaxed flow that's one of the nice qualities of yoga.  It can also sometimes jump between different needs regarding the props you're expected to have handy without giving a great deal of warning (though once you've done the same routine several times, this is likely to stop being an issue for you).  For most poses the descriptions of what you should be doing are well done, but there are a couple where the action on the screen and the narration are out of sync, and it feels very awkward for them to be telling you to do something else while the demonstrator is still just holding the previous phase of the pose.

I think that this can be a valuable DVD to have on hand for days when you have special needs, such as if you're not feeling very well and want the option of picking a very gentle routine to help you relax, or if you may have overworked yourself in another activity and need to pick something you can do sitting down.  For people who are looking for the DVD they'll be using the majority of the time, though, I think most will enjoy it a lot more if they stick with finding a beginner's yoga DVD where an entire routine is filmed as a whole, so that you can get the experience of having the instructor move with you from one pose to the next and talking through the entire sequence as a whole.  For most people I think that will really be more enjoyable.

(That said, if you can manage to set up even a couple of lessons with a live instructor who can actually see you to correct your positions, that's always a good idea to minimize the chances that you might injure yourself.  Regardless, be careful at first since your body isn't used to these kinds of positions, and if you try to force something you may regret it.)

If you do decide to get this video, expect to need a chair (ideally the standard 4-legged type that stays in one place, rather than something on wheels), a yoga mat, a blanket or towel, a yoga belt (basically a long strap) and a couple of yoga blocks if you want to have all of the props on hand that they use to make the poses require less flexibility.",1250467200,11,3522,4.323216995447648

Some of the poses are easier, such as standing properly, while others have ranges of movement and motion depending on which things you pick.  You can use props that help you learn and you get the poses right without hurting yourself.  As you get better you can rely less on the props if you want to.

Good combination of easy things and items for when you get better/more flexible. Very well done.",1239494400,,620,4.451327433628318

The person doing the poses is hyperextending her knee on several poses (which will aggravate any joint pain!), and ""helpful"" instructions like ""spread your ribs outward laterally"" or ""move the backs of your thighs outward and move your tailbone down into that space"" or ""experience your breath"" not only make no sense, but trying to figure out what the heck she means takes you out of any relaxation you've achieved.

I knew it was bad when the instructor suggested private sessions or that I spend some additional time with a quality instructional DVD at home.

She actually suggested this one and I'm glad she did.  Judi Rice is a very experienced yoga teacher and the instruction on the DVD is excellent.  Very detailed.  Lots of help for learning proper alignment from the very start by using a chair, blocks, a strap and blankets.  The chair has been especially helpful as I have almost no flexibility to start with.  I'm very happy with this DVD.",1237248000,,695,4.504

The DVD creator's idea of ""yoga for inflexible"" people is comprised of a whole lot of standing around with outstretched arms and legs.  Not even joking.  Yes, this DVD is targeted for inflexible people - but I think that she could have challenged them with a little more than that.  If you are looking for yoga for beginner inflexible people - please look elsewhere.

Working with this DVD has improved things alot. It is very easy to understand and use, most of the time I use the legs section (just pick it from the menu) and up comes about 6 routines to work with. Other sections focus on other aspects.

The pace is just right so that I can follow along without feeling rushed or that I am missing something and it gives me time to get into the pose.

In the last year I have made a big improvement.  The DVD itself is broken down into main sections focusing on different areas and also some general routines.  In each area there is a good selection of poses to help you learn the moves.  Some are easy to start with, such as just standing properly and relaxing, while there are longer sections which add to the poses and increase the range of movements in the poses and adds additional poses.  I look back at where I was and realize how far I have come.

The pace is good and I never felt rush or hurried so I could learn how to move into the poses without straining.  I hope to find the time to try to make it back to classes but I am happy I still had a chance to learn.",1230768000,3,1030,3.9902439024390244

The Iyengar yoga techniques, which focus on alignment and precision, include modifications for beginner students using props like belts, blocks, and blankets.  The instruction can seem repetitious, but since the teacher isn't really there to correct errors, this ends up being helpful in understanding the poses.  Even if you end up switching to a different technique later, this provides a good background in the poses.  My review would be five stars, but the instruction on breathing wasn't always clear, and there were some errors in the recording.  However, there's an impressive variety of workouts from beginner to moving towards more advanced work, and true to the spirit of Iyengar yoga, I've found these techniques to really help in promoting a clearer, less stressed mind.",1226793600,3,945,5.143790849673203

 I especially like the fact that one DVD has 35 separate routines on it, varying in length from 15 minutes to an hour, and concentrating on specific areas. So if you only have 15 minutes and are having neck problems, there is a routine you can do. And they do help! I now try to do yoga with this video everyday. Even 20 minutes a day has made a prfoound difference, and best of all -- the aches and pains are gone, and I have more stamina! I highly recommend this DVD!",1225324800,13,744,4.061224489795919

1782865,5,B00006JXWB,"I had a terrible accident almost 11 years ago, and after that everything hurt, so I stopped doing the things that hurt, and I became my body's worst enemy, all my muscles got tight and uncomfortable, and a few times a year my back would go out and that seemed, while terrible, normal.  I got down on the fit path, and I do a very good workout routine now, but I still hated stretching because I was so inflexible, and the back still went out.

I moved from stretching into this yoga video.  It might not be like a complete smooth routine, but you can plan your own routine from the dvd menu screen.  And you are slowly learning to move your body into a more flexible structure.  I suppose the philosophy of yoga is not explained very well if at all, however, right now my concern is to get my body back to mostly limber.  Once I feel that these positions have helped me do that I will hopefully move on to full routines.

If you have wanted to try yoga but are either overweight or inflexible, this program is a very gentle, sensible introduction to allow you to try and not feel foolish.

This program can be tailored to fit your needs every day, you can choose a strength program, a flexibility program or relaxation or energizing.  You can also move between the body parts you would like to exercise, your back, your hips, your arms, your legs, you get the picture.  That is how you can build up to 35 different programs.

I don't like the screen going black between positions. You'll perform one position standing, the screen goes black, and then you're sitting, without having gotten there by means of a position like forward fold. I would have preferred routines which stretch my whole body in one routine and don't really like the focus on individual body parts for an hour. I would also have preferred routines which move you from standing to seated and back, instead of focusing on one or the other. Some of the positions are shown opposite of the narration - when the narrator tells you to bend your right leg, the demonstrator bends her left, which is somewhat confusing.

First of all, there does not appear to be anything special about the instruction or poses that is special for inflexible people.  If these poses are for inflexible people, then I guess I need the video for petrified people.

Second, many of the instructions make absolutely no sense to me whatsoever.  Have you ever tried to follow assembly instructions that read like they they were translated into English by someone who doesn't really speak English?  Here is an example from the instructions for ""Tadasana"":

""Stand with the inner borders of your feet touching.  Extend back from your inner arches through your heels and forward through your toes.  Plant your feet firmly on the floor, and draw the muscles and bones of your legs up and back.  Take your inner thighs back and broaden the back of the thighs from the inside out.  This broadens the back of the thighs in [maybe ""and""?] the pelvic area.  Into that space bring your tailbone forward.""

while attending yoga classes.  Not being able to even approximate the poses can make you feel very inadequate--maybe properly so.

Yoga For Inflexible People is not for people who really are inflexible. It's for beginners who have the potential to become more flexible. There's a big, big difference.

If you want to do more vigorous yoga, you'll have to go somewhere else, but I've been amazed at how much these gentle routines have done to improve my flexibility, strength, and stamina.

What I don't like about it is that there are long pauses between the each set of yoga postures in a given routine -- I get bored and it's too much of a rest for me, but someone who's aerobically challenged might actually prefer this.  What makes this ""yoga for inflexible people"" is that the instructor shows you how to use blocks and other modifications to get into poses that might be challenging for a beginner.  I found that I didn't need most of the modifications (I may have tight hamstrings and touching my toes again was a strain at first, but I could do the camel pose shown on another dvd right off the bat, go figure).

What's great about the DVD is that there is a variety of routines to choose from, so if this is the only yoga DVD you purchased, you wouldn't get bored of it too easily.  The music is nice, too.

It is also true, as someone else noted, that the voice and actions are not always corresponding.

It's hard to focus on getting the pose right when the the description the voice is giving doesn't match the picture on the screen.

I DO like the fact that they show you different angles of the pose so you can see the shape that you are working towards.

It is set up to target areas (Hips & Back, Legs, Shoulders) and also provides sections of General, Energizing and Relaxing routines.  I started originally with the Hips & Back section, but now also use some of the other sections.  The variety is great, each section has about 1/2 dozen routines or so.  Just as important there is a wide range of times so I can choose what I want.  About 1/2 of the routines on the DVD are 30 minutes or less and 1/2 of those are 20 Minutes or less, so there is a good selection for me on the days when I have less time.

Another thing I like is the use of props, the strap and blocks really helped me get into positions comfortably, but as I progressed I found I used them less (and of course you do not have to use them if you are comfortable without them.)

To the extent that there is a negative, the set is not a beach scene, but it is not a concern for me because I am trying to learn.  I much rather have the flexibility I am developing as oppossed to the beach, and I have enough photos from my trips if I want to look at beaches :)

1783018,4,B00006JXWB,"first, i think the woman demonstrating the moves was fine.  this is YOGA, not freakin aerobics, for crying out loud.  i for one am perfectly happy to have someone who doesn't have a plastic smile pasted on her face showing me the moves.  i'm not looking for inspiration, i'm looking for instruction.  for one thing, the woman they film is not the one speaking at least in the bits i viewed.  SHE is not the instructor, or if she is, it's not obvious.  therefore, she is simply executing the moves described in the voice-over.  i found her perfectly human, and if she's not dynamic or animated enough for some people, that doesn't make her a zombie.  i bought this video with some trepidation having read these reviews and want to say i found them a bit ridiculously overstated.  everyone is entitled to their opinion, and that's fine, but if you are put off by reading this, just please know if you want a demonstration, that's what you are going to get, if you want charismatic leadership, you might want a different video.  but i wouldn't assume that you will find this model is somehow inhuman because she isn't emoting all over the place.

with all that said.  i was looking for a dvd with some brief workouts.  i think is a good instructional video for yoga, particularly for beginners.  i did find sometimes the voiceover and the modelling did not match up, the voiceover seemed to give some instructions which were just not modelled, but i did not find this interfered too much overall. the voiceover was more helpful in doing the little things that were almost imperceptable, like ""widening the inner thigh"" type moves.  understanding the special vocabulary was sometimes confusing.  for instance, with a real novice, do they really know what it means to ""lengthen the spine"" or ""flare the collarbone"" - am i really doing what she is telling me to do?  maybe i need to go back to the dvd and see if there is an introductory workout, but, if there is, i probably already passed on it because it was too long for me to get into.

i also found that sometimes the instructions were confusing to me as a novice.  i did not find enough brief workouts to be useful to me.  also, you will need props, which was disappointing.  they used, in the two that i viewed, a chair and blankets.  i really need something that is bare bones.  at least they aren't using the props to promote their own products, they are things you can find around the home.

i think if you want to really learn yoga, this is probably a good instructional dvd to have in your collection - whether it is the best, especially for a sole purchase, depends on what else it out there.  if you want to do yoga simply to stretch and gain some of the health benefits more than as a practice, and particularly if you are looking for a library of brief practices, you may not be so happy with this one.  i will probably end up buying another dvd, but i'm did give this four stars, and i expect to continue to use it, just not for the original reason i bought it.",1138233600,23,3023,4.450909090909091

UPDATED 9-1/2 YEARS AFTER FINDING THIS DVD:

It turns out the pain and stiffness were caused by inflammation in the body. Once I brought the inflammation down, this DVD helped me get most of my limberness back. Although I'm infinitely better now and would no longer term myself ""inflexible"", I still use this DVD regularly. The routines themselves are excellent.

1783025,4,B00006JXWB,"I bought this DVD as a gift but never gave it and one day just decided to try it.  I never would have bought this for myself since I don't consider myself inflexible but I found it to be a great, slow, easy intro to yoga.  Many other yoga videos I've tried were intimidating and I was never sure if I was doing things correctly.  This one goes very slow and is very relaxing and provides alternatives for beginners that let you ease into the more challenging poses.  I also like the menu format which provides several workouts in each of 6 or so different categories (shoulders, standing poses, legs, etc) and tells you the time of each one at the menu level.  This lets you work on what you want to work on in the time you have.  The music is also perfect for yoga.",1123200000,24,766,4.212328767123288
1783026,3,B00006JXWB,"Abit too slow. Has too many props.

The presenter is abit dull, didn't give me a lot of motivation to carry on with it...

I had better... (like crunch`s fat burning yoga...).",1123027200,7,175,4.4375
1783027,2,B00006JXWB,"The appeal of this DVD is the large number of workouts it has.  You can pick a basic workout, a workout focused on a specific body part, an energizing or relaxing workouts, or even a menstruation workout.  There are also several lengths for each type of workout, ranging from 15 to 90 minutes.

The workouts have poor production quality, though, and don't really flow.  Each pose consists of a short chapter of 3-10 minutes, which are reused in many of the workouts.  So you'll do a pose, then there's a pause while your DVD player finds the right chapter to go to next.  Then there's a black screen with the name of the pose and a listing of props you might need.  Then the pose is explained and demonstrated. You may need to pause the DVD at this point to get for the props and put them in the right place.  Props needed include: pillow, yoga blocks (2), towel or yoga strap, chair, and a wall to lean up against.

In addition to the lack of flow, the production leaves something to be desired.  The background is a bland blue-grey wall.  There is a person demonstrating the poses, and a voice over explaining the poses.  The explanations do not always match what the demonstrator is doing.  So that is annoying.  The demonstrator is a woman who wears a lifeless, somewhat depressing expression (or should I say lack of expression) throughout all of the workouts.  If these things don't bother you, than this DVD is a great value.  But personally, I'd rather do something else that's a bit more inspiring.",1119484800,39,1507,4.5464684014869885
1783028,5,B00006JXWB,"I started practicing yoga to gain some flexibility, and I picked it this DVD up. If you are new to yoga and are looking to learn, I would highly recommend this DVD.  (I have progressed in my Yoga Practice, but still refer to this DVD from time to time and to work on certain problem areas of my body.)

The wide variety of exercises which target all areas of your body will help you proceed. As the title states, this is yoga for INFLEXIBLE people, so there is a strong tendency to make sure routines are geared to those who may need a bit more assistance, which is includes the use of props to help your body get into position when you need it.  So if you need the props, you can use them.  Someone pointed out that this is a major drawback, but it fact it is a positive feature.

The DVD is clear in its instruction; take time to watch a routine before you do it.  You will know what is coming and what props are needed and it is very easy to prepare for the workout.  Belts for straps, books for blocks and so on - anything you need is probably around your house, and you do not need to use them if your body does not need them.  If you have ever taken any real yoga class, these things should not be a surprise to you.  Even if you had to purchase some of these items, a quick search on amazon shows they are readily available at nominal prices.

Also it is a very good idea to find a certified yoga instructor and take classes if you can.  (Be careful of some of the ""gym"" and similar fitness classes - find a reputable yoga studio where the instructors have real experience and training, I made that mistake early on.)

If you are willing to take a brief amount of time to work with this, you will benefit - I have.  If you are turned off by using some props (if you need them) or are not looking for slower paced routines which help you develop as a beginner, well then I would not recommend this title to you and you should look elsewhere.

You also may want to look at reviews from yoga and fitness magazines; someone implied that some less favorable reviews on amazon may be more ""realistic"".  I would think the Yoga Journal, which called it one of the most intelligent and useful presentations served up in a long time and that teachers should pick it up to learn how to properly teach yoga to beginners, might be a review worth considering.",1118620800,18,2352,4.21875
1783029,5,B00006JXWB,"I have been using this DVD for about six months and definately feel better about my flexibility.  It is a good speed and there are suggestions (not requirements) for using props as needed in case you cannot do something easily - I have been able to stop using props in some places, so I guess I am improving,

Someone mentioned that they had difficulty is finding props, but the DVD provides you with a list of substitutes that most people have around their house anyway so to me it was not a problem.",1114387200,16,501,4.376344086021505
1783030,5,B00006JXWB,"I found the DVD to be helpful and continuing my practice at home.  I haven't been practicing yoga for that long, but I've gathered up several materials, including a few books that provide some helpful info on yoga poses and variations, which is extremely helpful for beginners and people who are less then flexible. The DVD is great, but as with anything else in life I wouldn't necessarily put all my eggs in one basket.  Its always good to get several perspectives.  Overall you cant go wrong when purchasing this DVD.",1114387200,9,520,4.6923076923076925
1783031,2,B00006JXWB,"Let me start by saying that I AM a beginner (I've only been practicing for 4 months, 1-2 times a week) and I love yoga, but this DVD is very frustrating.

One of the reasons that I tried yoga in the first place was the fact that you don't have to have fancy clothes or equipment.

Unfortunately, the biggest MINUS for this DVD is that most of the poses are demonstrated with props. A few are listed below:

1. an extra yoga mat (rolled up)

2. spare folded blankets (one pose required 3 blankets!)

3. a folding chair

4. a yoga belt

5. yoga blocks

6. and the wall (repositioning required)

Although you can be creative to find substitutes for these items, unless you've memorized the sequence, you don't know what props will be required until each individual pose starts.  I have found myself scrambling numerous times to find the appropriate substitutes, which is very distracting to my concentration.  Surely, poses can be modified for inflexible folks without breaking the bank on props.

I also don't think this DVD does a very good job demonstrating the body positioning for each pose.  And the verbal instructions for some of the poses are very unclear. Nor does this DVD stress the importance of constantly breathing and proper breathing techniques.

I recommend renting or borrowing this DVD before buying it.  Also, before buying, read comments from reviewers who rated the DVD 1-3 stars.  I only focused on the positive comments before I bought--BIG mistake.  The more negative (realistic?) reviews appear to have some very accurate information.  Good luck!",1113350400,42,1570,4.860377358490566
1783032,5,B00006JXWB,"I love this DVD for its interactive capabilities and tremendouns variety.  I own over 50 videos/DVDs and this would have to be one of the best, if not the best.  I finally decided to try yoga but thought I wasn't flexible enough.  Within a month my body started to come around and open up as I often here yoga teachers say.

Cant speak highly enough about it.  Lots of substance.",1107820800,16,379,4.357142857142857

1783034,5,B00006JXWB,This DVD is fantastic for learning the basic yoga poses and then working them into a series. Varied levels of difficulty give the owner control over each workout's intensity.,1101686400,10,174,5.0344827586206895

As usual everyone has an opinion. Someone recommended that I try yoga, but frankly I was never really that flexible and yoga seemed so boring.  I started taking classes in late summer, but was still a bit conscious.  My instructor recommeded that I start practicing at home whenever I can so I picked up this DVD after reading about it here.  I loved it for many reasons.  The routines were geared for many fitness levels, but the yoga flow was steady and the instructors were highly knowledgeable, and kept the workouts interesting.",1098835200,17,686,4.590163934426229
1783036,5,B00006JXWB,"This is another product I recommend for people who need to increase flexibility/recover from an injury.

The technique and instruction is clear and precise and you will be able to follow along without injuring yourself; often videos fail in that respect.  The use of props, if needed, is also a welcomed bit of instruction.  Very often people will hurt themselves by pushing too hard too quickly, and this helps prevent that.  It also helps you focus on specific parts of your body (legs, arms etc.) so you can select you ""tight"" areas which need more help, though the routines do not ignore other parts of your body.

There is a slight pause between segments which helps you rest for a few seconds before getting ready for the next section, much like a regular yoga class will do.

While it is true that the DVD does not concentrate too heavily on pure meditative aspects of yoga, anyone who is buying this DVD (as the title says, it is for Inflexible People) should not be too concerned with that aspect of yoga.  It is for beginners (or perhaps people who have not practiced in awhile) so they learn how to do yoga safely and properly.  As you advance in yoga, the mind will follow the body, not the other way around.

If you are a beginner, need to loosen up spots or otherwise develop a solid foundation for future yoga practice, this is a great DVD.",1098835200,20,1355,4.520491803278689
1783037,3,B00006JXWB,"This DVD concentrates on technique, rather than on the meditative experience of yoga.  While the routines are great at describing how exactly you are supposed to do each pose, I found the presentation to be choppy.  I would prefer to have one posture flow into another, with a soft guiding voice.  The voiceover here is grating to my ears after a while, and I find myself thinking ""would you please shut up"", which is not the feeling with which I want to be practicing yoga!  While there are a lot of routines to pick from, again, I would prefer several all-inclusive routines, rather than this variety of body parts to focus on.  If you would like yoga to help you connect with your body and spirit, rather than just be a physical exercise, check out the Kripalu Yoga series.",1094860800,26,776,4.553956834532374
1783038,5,B00006JXWB,"Living in a region where Yoga instructors are few and far in between, I purchased this DVD based upon the wonderful reviews it received. I knew nothing of the subject and have been intimidated by Yoga in the past. The key word ""inflexible"" definitely applies to me. It offers you alternative ways through props to practice each pose. In addition, it teaches you to focus on your breathing and to relax while working out. For those who are more flexible, just simply omit the ""props"".

 You'll like this soothing but strenuous workout. Perfect for those of us who find other forms of exercise to be too challenging. With a bit of soothing for the soul as well to top it all off.",1091145600,11,677,4.540983606557377
1783039,5,B00006JXWB,"I bought this video last year after seeing a review in the Yoga Journal and based on advice from my instructor as I was starting Yoga. (she uses routines from this DVD in class).
As others have pointed out there are numerous routines in the DVD, and what some people perceive as ""minuses"" are in my opinion pluses.  For instance:
-  The introduction in sanskrit for each exercise is short and lasts no more than a few seconds.  If you are new to yoga, it is an excellant way to learn the names of the exercises in english and sanskrit
-  The use of chairs, walls and props is a benefit to to those of us who are inflexible, and are made as recommendations to assist inflexible people in performing the routines.  These are sugestions by the intructor and not always needed if you do not feel you need assistance.  The instructor makes that clear.
-There is an extensive variety of routines, and there are many shorter routines to build on.  Out of the 30+ routines on the DVD, there are 7 routines or so of 15 - 20 minutes and about another 7 or so of 30 minutes.  There is more then enough material to build on, and when you progess, there are many other routines on the DVD.
Perhaps there could be a bit more pep at points, and if you are a more advanced student you may be looking for different things in your workouts.
I was looking to learn yoga properly to increase my flexibility and this DVD is excellant.  As the Yoga Journal said  (which is above in the editorial reviews along with other publications that rated this DVD highly) this is an intelligent and useful DVD.",1087171200,15,1578,4.373287671232877
1783040,5,B00006JXWB,"I was not too interested in this DVD at first--mainly because of the title. I thought the yoga workouts would be too basic. Although I'm not as flexible as I'd like to be, I can still do the postures without the props. I'm still a beginner, so the benefit is in the pacing. It's incredibly slow. At first I was frustrated by the slow pace, but then I realized the DVD gives me the perfect opportunity to work on my form in doing each posture. The whole point of yoga (for me) is to relieve tension and not run through poses like an obstacle course, so therein lies the benefit. It forces one to slow down and really contemplate each pose while focusing on the breath and proper form. This is not a DVD for anyone looking for a ""power yoga"" workout, but the selection of routines is varied and can fill whatever time one has to practice. With sessions ranging from 15 minutes to 75 minutes, viewers can mix and match to fill the time they have. The only negative is in the voiceover--it's a tad too monotonous.",1080345600,21,1009,4.343915343915344

Pluses:
There are a number of programs and the DVD menu is extensive.
Minuses:
The presenter is uninteresting.
Each exercise is painstaking introduced with a title card, a voice over announcement, and then the actual video of the routine.  Some of which are cut choppily.
There isn't much encouragement or uplifting spirit coming from the video.
There is too much reliance on chairs, walls and props.
Its captures none of the ""flow"" of yoga.
If what you are looking for is a clinical walk-through of poses you might see in a yoga book, this is the video for you.
If you are looking for a video that has 15 to 20 minute routines you can build on, this is not the DVD for you.

1783043,2,B00006JXWB,"This DVD was highly reviewed in many sources, and as a novice in yoga who wanted to increase my flexibility I was very excited about it. Thank heavens I borrowed it before I bought it. What a disappointment.
The instructions are given using terms like ""lift your kneecaps"" and ""open your chest"" with no indication of what exactly the narrator means by that. The instructor is no help because she doesn't appear to be making any discernable movements. In the first ""basic"" segement she stands almost totally still (with the occasional toe wiggle for balance) for several minutes all while the narrator describes her supposed moves.
Perhaps if I knew more about Yoga, I would have known what she was doing. But a full front shot of someone ""pulling back their upper thighs"" pretty much looks like a person standing still. The fact that the instructor is completely expressionless doesn't help.
I skipped around to some other workouts to see if they'd be better and they weren't. The required a lot of props (two blankets folded lengthwise and a support for your head, for example) Then the instructor was about a step and a half behind the narrator - making it even more confusing. And if an inflexible person can cross their legs and then lean back into a lying position they're NOT inflexible.
I give this DVD two stars because there are a lot of workouts for one DVD and I'm sure someone more familiar with Yoga would know better what was happening. The thing is, someone familiar with Yoga probably wouldn't need a routine for inflexibility.",1075420800,28,1543,4.7611940298507465

My back, I feel, is improving day by day.  It is some work, but the benefits are tremendous. I called the company to ask them a question about the product, and their customer support was excellent.

Some of the movements (child's pose, for instance) require sitting on your heels, not something an inflexible person (or one with bad knees) is able to do.  The workout doesn't flow, but has abrupt stops and starts.  The seated general workout I is not improved in general seated workout II, some moves are just repeated.

The DVD modifies poses, which help make poses more accessible.  As another reviewer mentioned, there is a variation of Downward Facing Dog that uses a chair, which helped me tremendously since I had a hard time with the regular down dog that also appears on the DVD.  Part of my back problem, my wife tells me, is my really tight shoulders.  There are enough routines and poses on this DVD to keep me going for a long time.

It's all basic stretching, stretching, stretching. I had high hopes for this since it's got such good ratings, but I can't recommend it.
The production quality is low, with a voiceover. The lighting isn't the best, and the model who demonstrates the poses looks bored. I mean no offense to her appearance, but more in how she's presenting herself. She looks like she just rolled out of bed.

What I particularly love about the DVD is that I have choices. I can select what parts of my body to work on when I want to work on them.  The instructor is clear and concise.  They routines can be done at any level, beginner to intermediate.  I have never seen anything like this where you can select what you want to do when you want to do it.  It's truly revolutionary.

It has fantastic detailed instruction so you are safe to explore yoga at your own pace, but it really let's you access parts of the body that I didn't know even existed.  And it is so relaxing! People who are looking for some fast paced workout to really sweat to might not be as thrilled, if that is what makes you happy (I got the Yoga for Athletes from the same company and these workouts are more challenging, but equally wonderful).

1783063,4,B00006JXWB,"Let me first say that you will really get your money's worth out of this DVD.  Unlike some of the Gaiam DVDs, which are also great, this DVD contains dozens of practices (workouts).  The DVD has 60-some chapters, each chapter being a yoga pose.  The poses are then put into different combinations to make the various practices. They range from ""Hip Openers"" to ""Standing Basics"" to ""Relaxation"" and ""Energizing."" There are even two ""Menstruation Series"" with modified poses. Many of the poses do use props, as they are essential for the ""Inflexible People,"" but they are as simple as a chair and a yoga mat.  It is stated that the rest can be substituted. For example, a few books for the yoga bricks and a bathrobe belt or some towels for the strap.
The production is basic - the demonstrator is not on a beach in Hawaii - but it is straightforward.  One of the best parts is that time is taken to explain each pose in depth.  I own about 10 yoga DVDs and this one is the best in terms of really taking time for the pose, which is true to the spirit of yoga. And you could use this DVD for weeks without ever doing the same workout twice.
The only thing I would suggest is that you take a basic yoga class from a qualified instructor. (Not the YMCA or a Gym - learn from someone who only teaches yoga and has studied for a while.) The information you get when you're working with a live person makes Yoga For Inflexible People much easier to follow in terms of proper body alignment and breathing.",1043884800,20,1498,4.370503597122302
