451196,5,6302271991,"Anyone viewing this DVD may wonder why it isn't in a letterboxed format.  Although this 1962 release is loaded with fantasy action set pieces, aided by Peter Ellenshaws extensive special effects, Disney decided to shoot this feature, for reasons unknown, in the standard academy (1.33:1) format.  The full screen format on this DVD is the aspect ratio projected in its theatrical releases.",1508112000,,389,5.258064516129032

451244,5,6302271991,"In Search of the Castaways is from the days when Disney was really family friendly,
 and this movie doesn't disappoint.
 The actors deliver great performances plus the action scenes are just plain fun.
I loved it as a kid because of the romantic notion of going on a quest.
 The exciting almost amusement park like thrills in this movie are still impressive even by today's standards.
I'm in my sixties now and was surprised to find I loved it even more now than I did when I was a kid.
A really good one to watch with the grandkids or munching your snacks alone in the dark.
A real 'treat' movie.",1492646400,4,597,4.36036036036036

451276,2,6302271991,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother, because she's a big fan of Haley Mills. I had never seen the movie before, but our family has enjoyed Pollyanna, The Parent Trap, That Darned Cat, Summer Magic, and The Moonspinners - all Haley Mills Disney films from the 1960's, so I assumed we would enjoy this one, too. I was so wrong. I honestly feel that this is one of the stupidest films Disney every produced. Stock footage is rampant, stereotypes are heavily overplayed, and the antics are dumb. Actors that are fantastic in other movies, at like morons in this one. One of my personal pet peeves (as a student of history) is that the movie starts by showing a fancy dinner party on a boat, in which women are coming and going in the ""fashion of the times"". The movie is set it 1858, yet the women are wearing fashions from the 1880's. That may sound like something to nit-pick about, but I feel it makes an important point: Disney did no research for this film, threw it together without concern over how it would do in a box office, and moved on to the next project in the blink of an eye. The entire film is one big, idiotic movie. I wouldn't recommend it, even for Haley Mills fans. I think Jules Verne would be fairly horrified.",1488499200,,1241,4.353448275862069

451279,4,6302271991,"I'm dating myself, but I saw this movie as a kid in the theater. I found it exciting and just right for action as a kid. It was interesting to watch it again and own it on DVD. It didn't have the same impact as before, but brought back fond memories.",1487462400,,250,3.9215686274509802

All 3, ages 4 to 8 have watched this film too many times to be counted.  They don't understand about the poorly cropped film or how hokey the never-ending drama is at times; they simply love every exciting (over-dramatized) scene.  It's constant excitement without today's gore or rude humor.  I can turn it on, hear their squeals and excited laughing and rest assured knowing they're getting good old-fashioned entertainment without any of the objections in today's kids' fare.

Some of the special effects are dated by today's standards, but even so, Baby Boomers and their children alike will enjoy the period-piece details and the rollicking adventure.  Hayley Mills is delightful as ever, and although the musical numbers are a bit corny, that's all part and parcel of watching a Disney movie from this time period.  It's that very innocence and lack of guile that adults will appreciate with nostalgia, and today's (younger) kids will take at face value.  It's not an all-time Disney classic, but it's entertaining and fun for a bit of light diversion.",1426636800,,725,4.975206611570248

451654,5,6302271991,"Adapted from a lesser known book by Jules Verne, Captain Grant's Children (In Search of the Castaways), is an adventure film starring Maurice Chevalier, Hayley Mills (in her third of six films for Disney Studios), Wilfrid Hyde-White, and George Sanders.  The story deals with the search for Captain John Grant, missing and believed dead by everyone except his children (Mills and Keith Hamshere as her brother Robert Grant), and their friend Professor Jacques Paganel (Maurice Chevalier).  They attempt to enlist the aid of their father's employer, a pompous twit with more bluster than bite, Lord Glenarvan (played by Wilfrid Hyde-White).  His Lordship wastes a great deal of time making up his mind to help them in their rescue mission.  He's aptly aided in his indecision by his son John (overplayed by Michael Anderson, Jr.).  If arrogance were an art form, they'd be kings, not lords.  At any rate, they abruptly lose their dismissive attitudes and set sail for who knows where because they certainly didn't.  They literally searched high and low for the poor captain.  They're plucky though, absolutely nothing gets in their way.  Neither earthquakes, a giant condor, swooshing down a mountain, a fast flood, nor villainous Sanders could stay them from their quest.  As an added bonus, they sing several songs by the Sherman Brothers: Castaway, Merci Beaucoup, Enjoy it, and Let's Climb (Grimpons).  As adventures go, this one is pretty good, thanks mostly to the fanciful story and performances by Mills and Chevalier.

A huge hit in December of 1962, this enduring semi-classic deserves a better presentation than the crappy transfer offered to date.  Maybe the Disney Company will do it justice and release it on Blu-ray.  I'd upgrade it in a heartbeat.",1421884800,,1762,5.115384615384615

451820,3,6302271991,"Haley Mills gave spectacular performances in POLLYANNA and THE PARENT TRAP--but as time went by Disney became uncertain of what do with its young star.  The resulting films included IN SEARCH OF THE CASTAWAYS, loosely based on one of Jules Verne's lesser novels.  It was one of the biggest money makers of 1962, but time has not been very kind to this movie, which essentially puts its cast through one disaster after another in the hope that audiences won't realize how badly written and filmed the whole thing is.

Mary and Robert Grant (Haley Mills and Keith Hamshere) have discovered evidence that their shipwrecked father Capt. Grant (Jack Gwillim) is still alive.  They set off in search of him with seadog Jacques (Maurice Chevalier) and ship owner Lord Glenarvan (Wilfrid Hyde White), and with about ten minutes or so they are stranded on top of a mountain.  An earthquake, an avalanche, a wild ride through a tunne. in a glacier, a condor attack, a flood, and a leopard immediately follow.  Eventually our brave band is even called upon to fight Maori savages.  Ultimate, they must do battle with the suavely sinister George Saunders.

For a film that has so many adventures, CASTAWAYS is only mildly exciting.  The cast is charming, but it isn't charming enough to allow you to suspend disbelief re the nonsensical plot--much less the perfunctory script.  The movie is presented in pan and scan, and lots of hardcore fans protest that, but frankly thought the movie so ho-hum that I doubt a full widescreen presentation would help it very much.

451821,5,6302271991,I have looked for this movie for a long time. I remember watching it as a child and had no clue what the name of it was. I finally found it and when I saw it on Amazon I knew I had to have it. Great wholesome movie.,1377043200,,215,3.5
451822,4,6302271991,"Not a lot to say other than it's a classic Disney affair with a great cast, fun adventure wonderfully directed by Robert Stevenson (The Love Bug, Blackbeard's Ghost).  Maurice Chevalier is all out Frenched to the gills complete with a singing donkey ride thrown in for good measure.  (the donkey doesn't sing, just Chevalier)

I love the way this movie starts.  It's almost like a Mamet play in that you're dropped right into the middle of the action and you have to sort your way out.  I don't know if they shot an entire opening and then just decided to lop it off for time sake, or if it was always intended to begin mid-story, but whatever the impetus it works very well.  It's an epic journey with a one two buckle your shoe and you're off to the races.

For any fan of the 1960's era Disney films you're more than likely to enjoy this film.  At the very least a rental will be a minimal expense to pay to try it out.",1376524800,2,922,4.258620689655173

I am 13 years old, and Captain Grant's children is my favorite novel, but this show is nothing like the book. For one, Lord Glenervan and Jacques Paganel switch characteristics, General McNabbs does not exist in the show, and Lord Glenervan has a son. Not only that, but Lord Glenervan is not the one to catch the shark, but rather Jacques Paganel finds it, gets Captain Grant's children, Mary and Robert, to go to Great Britain with him, and John Glenervan is the reason they go for the sake of the girl, Mary. If, on the other hand, you did not read Captain Grant's children, then here are some other reasons you should not buy this.
1. Robert Grant shows no emotion whatsoever, and
2. Lots of stupid things happen like sliding down an extremely large hill on a 20 foot piece of ice.

451979,5,6302271991,"i actually love this movie. it's, however, not the great film classic '20,000 Leagues' is. Disney's '20,000 Leagues' is a intelligent film that manages to rise above convention and formula as to present a well reasearched literary adaptation as well as historical authenticity. i can't say 'Castaways' achieves such lofty areas. it's allright as a historical piece, but it's fantasy telling has more in common with the shenanigans of Donald Duck than real adventure fantasy. in fact it's major undoing is probably because it's ambitions are more commercial than artistic or anything else.
  Haley Mills is her usual sweet ""Disney Girl"" self, and i've always loved the soft 'Castaway lullabye she sings in the movie. but Maurice Chevalier is a hammy, mug-the-camera, Godzilla monster. he's so awful he's good and his songs like ""OOO-LA LA ENJOOOOOOY IT"" are amongst the 'Monkees Unca' as Disney's worst songs. his performance here is even worse than in the notorious 'Mon-kee Go Home!' flick.
  not only that but it's persistence in conventional Disney formulas not only lead to weird songburst throughout but even strange lapses in logic that even a six year old might question. still i like the film just the way it is. wacky, goofy, corny and trite and totally pure Disney formula. it's all so unintentionally hilarious as well as very cute.

If you enjoy this and are looking for a similar fantastic science fantasy fun try Island At The Top Of The World - it's not Jules Verne but it captures the spirit perfectly - and Disney does an excellent job as always. I have been searching for a fifth film to follow the four aforementioned but none capture that same tone of fun innocenct escapism. The closest I have come is 1960's The Lost World starring Claude Rains but it just falls a bit short IMO. 1961's Master Of The World starring Vincent Price and Charles Bronson (yes, that Charles Bronson) tries but terrible special effects kill the effort, that and the fact that it is basically the same story as 20,000 LUTS but in an airship",1334188800,,1020,4.489247311827957

452050,5,6302271991,"In 1858 Glasgow, two young teens, Mary and Robert Grant, set forth on a daring journey across the ocean to find their castaway father and his companions with only a message in a bottle as an indication of his possible survival and clue to his location. They are joined by charming, carefree Frenchman Jacques Paganel, the stately Lord Grenarvan, and his teenage son, John, whose sights are casually set on Mary. The little band of adventures make their way to South America, Australia, and New Zealand on their search for the lost Captain Grant, and they encounter harrowing dangers every step of the way. Luckily, Paganel is played by Maurice Chevalier, and he is always ready to lighten things up with a song!

Released in 1962 and based on Jules Verne's book ""The Children of Captain Grant"", ""In Search of the Castaways"" is sort of a second tier Disney live-action classic, easily known by hardcore Disney fans and even often remembered by the general public, though not as much as films like ""Swiss Family Robinson"", ""Old Yeller"", ""The Parent Trap"", and a few others. This is probably because it is such a simple adventure story that doesn't spend much time on character relationships or subplots. It is purely a forward moving search to find the lost father. That's not to say it doesn't work. It's a fun, entertaining adventure with likeable, believable characters, and to my fellow Disney theme park lovers, this is one of those great ""Adventureland"" films. It does have another trait that may be the reason it is not quite as revered as the other films I mentioned (though this film is hardly among Disney's more obscure stuff), and that is the fact that the effects in ""In Search of the Castaways"" often seem sub par compared to other classic live-action Disney films, and I'm not really sure why it turned out that way. Some of those effects driven stunts are also quite absurd, admittedly, but that's forgivable in this fun-filled romp. Still, if you took serious issue with some of Indy Jones's more extreme survivals, you may not enjoy Castaways either. One has to go into the film ready to accept that what they are watching is not trying to be 100 percent realistic. This is more of a DuckTales kind of adventure, but it really is a delightful way to spend an hour and 38 minutes, and I still highly recommend it!

The main cast in ""In Search of the Castaways"" is excellent, including Disney fave Hayley Mills as Mary, the aforementioned Maurice Chevalier, Keith Hamshere as Robert, Wilfred Hyde White as Grenarvan, Michael Anderson, Jr. as his son, Wilfred Brambell as the very Ben Gunn reminiscent Bill Gaye, and even the voice of Shere Khan, George Sanders, as a rather suspicious character in the second half of the film. Directed by Disney great Robert Stevenson, it's really just the sometimes less impressive than expected visual effects that are the only real negative about the film, but the same can't be said for the DVD release, as it lacks any extras whatsoever and is presented in a full screen format. It's hard to say if this is a matted print or an open matte print, but it clearly is not the theatrical ""widescreen"" presentation, and one would hope for at least the theatrical trailer and maybe some bonus features that could be used on multiple Disney releases (at least), like a Hayley Mills or Sherman Brothers featurette, or one of those Disney yearbook montages. Alas, this one was released bare bones, but it still deserves a place on every DVD shelf for anyone who appreciates classic Disney and family adventures.

Also recommended: Disney's Swiss Family Robinson, Treasure Island, Island at the Top of the World, Shipwrecked, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. And for more Disney Hayley Mills: The Parent Trap, The Parent Trap 2, Pollyanna, Summer Magic, Moon Spinners, and That Darn Cat.",1280793600,,3864,4.816265060240964

In Glasgow in 1858, 14-year-old Mary Grant (Hayley Mills) and her younger brother Robert (Keith Hamshire) have been contacted by a French geographer, Prof. Jacques Paganel (Maurice Chevalier), who claims to have removed from the stomach of a shark a bottle containing a message from their father, a sea captain thought lost three years before.  Mary, who has never stopped believing that Capt. Grant is alive, resolves to confront Lord Glenarvan (Wilfrid Hyde-White), the owner of the shipping line to which Grant's ""Britannia"" belonged, and beg him to initiate a search.  With the help of the nobleman's 17-year-old son John (Michael Anderson, Jr.) she succeeds in persuading him, and the quintet set off aboard Glenarvan's new steam yacht on a voyage that takes them from Scotland to the coast of Chile to New Zealand and involves them in a series of improbable but thrilling adventures with an earthquake, a giant condor, a flood, a jaguar, hostile Maoris, and a silky-smooth gentleman pirate (George Sanders) and his band.

The movie relies heavily on miniatures, process shots, blue-screen, and other devices since become obsolete, but it does keep moving at a good brisk pace, and the suspense hardly lets up from the beginning.  There's also plenty of good clean humor, and Chevalier (who was 74 at the time) is a total delight; he even gets to sing a couple of songs.  Kids will accept it at face value, and adults can enjoy it too with a little suspension of disbelief.",1275004800,,2113,5.9801324503311255

To answer previous reviewers' questions and to make a long story short, if the film is shown in 1.33:1 fullscreen, it is P&S (like 'Blackbeard's Ghost', 'ThatDarn Cat!, and for that matter cartoons like 'Jungle Book' or 'Aristocats'). Ever since matted widescreen appeared in the mid-50's (1.85:1 in the US, 1.66 in France, and 1.75 in UK and Italy), and leaving aside the CinemaScope or Technirama features, Disney's movies were made, for some unclear reason, with an intended theatrical aspect ratio of 1.75 (they turned to 1.85 only recently).

Technically yes, these movies could be shown unmatted in a 1.37:1 aspect ratio, with useless empty space on top and bottom of the picture (for ex. Warner's releases of Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Eyes Wide Shut'), but chances are this is not the case here, because it is unlikely that in the now-accepted widescreen era, they would make a brand new fullscreen transfer.

Nope, what we have here is clearly a new rehash of the same old same VHS pan & scan transfer.

452223,1,6302271991,"Disney within a space of a few months has gone from one extreme to the other.
On the one hand they release a two disc version of one of their all time classics Mary Poppins,both sound and picture having been fully restored and cleaned close to perfection. A fitting compliment to both the film,its' stars and Disney itself.
Then comes the first time release onto DVD of this little Disney gem and it absolutely stuns you as you shake your head and check the box to make sure it really is a Disney product and not some kind of cruel joke.
Don't get me wrong the product(i.e.movie)is worth about a four star rating on its' own merits. It has a wonderful story line which takes our lead characters on an adventure in many far and distant lands and is a natural for older children to excite their imaginations. The special effects are pure Disney and of that era but were always done with great flare and still hold up fairly
well now.
Strangly enough the last review I wrote was about the abominable assassination of the Laurel and Hardy product being released by the ""wonderful folks"" at Hallmark. Never did I dream that I would run across another such product and especially a Disney one. But nevertheless here it is for all to see.
Bottomline is this. The aspect ratio is simply WRONG.It has been cleaned up yes through the usual digital means but it cannot hide the fact that this is the same cropped and pan and scan version we've seen on TV and on home video in years gone by. Everything from scenary,to animals to the actors themselves get cut off the screen. Furthermore,and I have felt this from the first time I saw it in such a state on TV and then later in its' video format that this movie was one of the worst victims of pan and scan that I'd ever seen. And viewing it once more in a clearer but absolute same state I'm convinced more than ever I was right all along. Also what ""extras"" there are,are for a release such as this pitifully few. It is a rip off,wrong and totally UNACCEPTABLE by any standards.
We as consumers must not just accept this sub standard product as the norm or let it go as is. I have said it before,I will say it again and keep saying it until every manufacturer and distributor of entertainment products in the audio and visual medium start treating consumers as something other than a cave dweller from the dark side of the moon.
Your credo's should be that ANY product that you release is done so with full knowledge(on both sides)that it was made with the utmost care and attention and all source elements used to create said products were of the highest quality available anywhere. And if any defects are found by the consumer then an exchange or refund to said consumer should be forthcoming immediately no questions asked.
Now THAT is the kind of relationship/understanding we as consumers should have had with the audio/visual industry since the beginning and we would have if the industry as a whole worked together and had any kind of confidence in their products.
In conclusion DO NOT BUY this product. It is an obvious cheap(for Disney) re-release of a film that deserves a far better fate than the one they have relegated to it. Let's see if we can get this abomination recalled and/or re-released in its' proper theatrical widescreen format so we can see it as it should be seen.",1115337600,140,3330,4.5240464344941955
452224,5,6302271991,"Hayley Mills made this picture after starring in the weird psychodrama WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND for director Bryan Forbes and before beginning work on one of her most well-loved features, playing Nancy in SUIMMER MAGIC.  Compared to those two films, IN SEARCH OF THE CASTAWAYS is no classic, but what it has in spades is large lashings of adventure and action.

Maurice Chevalier had been graylisted for many years due to suspicions that he had collaborated with the Nazis during the Vichy regime of World War II.  Nothing was ever proven one way or the other, but it took the combined push of Billy Wilder, Vincente Minnelli, and Jean Neguelsco to rehabilitate Chevalier in the late 1950s, in a 1-2-3 punch (respectively, LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON, GIGI, and COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS, each of which managed to feature Chevalier opposite a Hollywood leading lady (Hepburn, Caron, Kerr) in order to assure success.  After that, directors continued to employ Maurice Chevalier and he made nearly as many films in the last 15 years of his life than he had in the prime of his box office appeal (1930s).  He was often asked to step in and lend Gallic charm to many an international souffle, and if pressed he would sing, dance, and wave around his famous hat a little.  In SEARCH he has what might be the largest of all his post-GIGI roles, and surprise, he's quite believable in the part.  Maybe they should have used him as an action star more often.  I can almost picture him playing Robert Shaw's part in JAWS!

SEARCH also has a youngster playing the part of Hayley Mills brother, the actor Keith Hamshire, who was not used to Disney filmmaking and indeed never made another movie of any kind again, despite rumors for years that he later played in one of the early blockbuster porn films by Gerald Damiano.

All in all, this is a pleasant film with two wonderful performances and a rollicking scenario from the brain of Jules Verne.",1114992000,,1923,4.696428571428571

452226,3,6302271991,"In the early 1960s Hayley Mills starred in six Disney movies, ""Pollyanna"" in 1960, ""The Parent Trap"" in 1961, this movie in 1962, ""Summer Magic"" in 1963, ""The Moon-Spinners"" in 1964, and ""That Darn Cat"" in 1965.  While all six of the movies are enjoyable family fare, this movie has a depth and complexity approached only in ""Summer Magic.""  All six of the movies are enjoyable family fare, but the two action-adventure movies, ""In Search of the Castaways"" and ""The Moon-Spinners,"" are a bit campy and suffer from dated special effects.  Also, the recent DVD release appears to be in 1.33:1 or full screen format, maintaining the clipped appearance of the VHS movie.  Unfortunate, because there are portions of the movie where wide screen would enhance the adventure.

The movie opens with Mary Grant, played by Hayley Mills when she was about sixteen years old, and her brother Robert, played by Keith Hamshire, trying to meet with Lord Glenarvon, played by veteran actor Wilfred Hyde-White.  Jacques Paganel, played by Maurice Chevalier, accompanies the children.  Jacques found a bottle with a message in it, apparently from the children's father Captain Grant (Jack Gwillim), who was supposedly lost at sea.  After some funny shenanigans to get aboard Lord Glenarvon's ship, and apparently being taken back to their home in Portsmouth, the children are aided by Lord Glenarvon's son John in convincing the Lord that the note is genuine and that they should seek Captain Grant.  Michael Anderson Jr., who was in ""The Sundowners"" with Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr, and in ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" with John Wayne and Dean Martin, as well as numerous other movies, plays John Glenarvon.

The rescuers are off to South America and the Andes, where they encounter an earthquake that sends them on a wonderfully campy and humorous ride down the side of the mountains.  They then travel across the Pampas, where they encounter a tremendous flash flood and a jaguar.  The rescuers discover that Captain Grant was not in South America, but may be in Australia, which turns out to be another wild goose chase.

In Australia the rescuers encounter Thomas Ayerton, played by another veteran actor, George Sanders.  The children all recognize Ayerton as being somewhat unsavory, though Lord Glenarvon seems to think he will be helpful as he promises he knows exactly where Captain Grant's ship went down.  It turns out that Ayerton does know where Captain Grant's ship went down, but the reason why is chilling.  Unfortunately for the children and Lord Glenarvon, the realization that Ayerton has malice in his heart comes too late, and Ayerton turns the rescuers over Maori's in New Zealand.

In New Zealand the captured rescuers find Bill Gaye (Wilfrid Brambell, who later made an appearance in another Disney movie, ""The Three Lives of Thomasina), a mate from Captain Grant's ship who is now somewhat crazy.  The rescuers are able to use Robert Grant's size as an aid to escape from a precarious prison, and then use a taboo volcano to clinch their escape.  The movie climaxes as we see whether the children will find their father and whether they will escape from New Zealand.

This movie was loosely based on a Jules Verne adventure.  As with other Disney adventures of the 50s and 60s, there are a lot of tongue-in-cheek and larger-than-life scenes.  As implausible as the movie is, it is still a lot of fun and one of my favorite Disney movies, along with other movies in the same style, such as ""Swiss Family Robinson.""

There are a few scenes in the movie that even in the 1960s were weak, such as when the lava chases the Maoris.  The images of the Maoris running in place against a screen projection look fake.  Another of the beyond incredible scenes is when the rescuers take a ride down the side of a mountain in the Andes on a huge rock bowl.  As unrealistic as the scene is, it is cute and clever and one of my favorite scenes from the movie.

I call this type of movie a family popcorn muncher, because it is suitable for nearly all members of the family, and even many teenagers jaded by excessive special effects and video games find this movie to be fun.  At least everyone will get chance to laugh at the campy special effects and the unbelievable scenes.  Even with its flaws this movie is wonderful to own and to watch again and again (I'll admit to having seen it several times).

7824002,5,6302271991,"What a great movie, one I hadn't seen since I was a kid at a matinee. Disney was at the forefront of FX realism, and the multi-layered shots are flawless. I remember reading as a kid that Walt himself, after seeing treatments of the giant octopus in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, made his FX department keep redoing it, over and over again, until they had it just right. That same meticulousness can be seen here. Sadly, there is no BluRay release of this film, and both the Laserdisc and DVD versions were released only in ""Full Screen"" format, with the original 1.75:1 sliced off the sides to fit the 1.33:1 Fullscreen format. No widescreen versions were released. The 1.33:1 is available on Amazon Streaming as an SD version. However, wonder of wonders, Amazon also offers an HD version, which is much sharper and richer than the the DVD, and certainly the Laserdisc, and appears to be presented in it's original 1.75:1 format. Absolutely beautiful. At first I thought that maybe the 1.33:1 had been sliced off the top and bottom to widen it for HD, so, for my own edification, I compared several stills with the laserdisc. While the top or bottom show that perhaps a sliver is missing, the clincher was a hand holding a wineglass coming in from the left side of the HD that is completely missing from the Fullscreen version. I have no idea where Amazon found this beautiful rendition, but its available in HD as a $3.99 3 day rental.

As for the story and characters, oh yes, you're in for a treat. The search takes the characters to the far corners of the earth, from Glasgow to South America to across the Andes and the Indian Ocean. Haley Mills, Maurice Chevalier and Wilfred White lead a superb cast, the story never lags, and the entire adventure makes for one pleasant family evening.",1523491200,,1794,4.623824451410658
