Picture sharp and sound very good
Do wish they had put the movies in year sequence.",1405555200,7,196,3.9

8649559,5,B00JBBRN86,Tim Holt Western Classics Collection Volume 4 is a terrific collection of B-Westerns. My favorite is Overland Telegraph that was released in 1951. It stars George Nader who is so good looking. Fans of George Nader and B-Westerns will like this the most.,1465344000,,253,4.906976744186046
