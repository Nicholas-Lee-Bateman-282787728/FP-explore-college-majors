Monte Markim was perfect as the villain, what fun to see him toss a bar stool through our living room glass door. The crew was spectacular - shooting ran over into a week end when we had planned to have a birthday slumber party for our daughter - set manager  had his team clear the living room and set up for a slumber party - pretty neat. The cast and crew were great with the exception of Prima Donna Linda Carter, she refused to autograph a photo for our daughter. Too many great memories/stories about this film being made.",1477267200,,701,4.079710144927536
7803557,4,6300164357,"Lynda Carter is excellent.  The story line is a little predictible but overall it is very good, especially the ending.  It does not leave you guessing like other thrillers and it is not gross at all, just a little scary when the killer is finally revealed.  A must have for all the ""Sherlock Holmes"" out there.",1070409600,6,310,4.5
