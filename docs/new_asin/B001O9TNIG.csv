The brilliant original score by Rodgers & Hart is bent out of shape, truncated and sidelined to make way for depressing 'schtick' from the usually reliable cast of character actors from the 1930s who, in this instance, can't bring any life to the proceedings.  The romantic leads are also forced to utter dialogue that should never have been committed to paper. The stamp of Universal Studios (one of the 'poverty row' crowd} is all over this 'tragedy'.  The hubris of the producers is matched by the seller who is trying to peddle this mess for over $100 a copy.  I would almost be tempted to pay that much money if I could be assured that this film would be permanently erased from my memory.  It is available elsewhere for $12. If there is anything to recommend here it would be the fifteen minutes (or so) of music 'vaguely resembling' the original score and that the whole disaster is only 70 minutes long.  I sat all the way through HOPING that SOMETHING would improve this mess but, alas, nothing did. I wept.
  If you're hung up on the 'innovative' 1960s you might recognize that the chariot chase at the end is the same 'schtick' Richard Lester used to try to salvage the end of 'A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum'.  Here it is, A QUARTER OF A CENTURY EARLIER!  Ah well, ... 'The more things change, the more things remain the same'.",1377043200,,1523,4.481884057971015
8329999,3,B001O9TNIG,"The Boys From Syracuse (1940 Universal) starring Alan Jones and Martha Raye is a great classic black and white musical comedy movie, but it disappeared. Why?

The only copy of this movie presently (2012) available for sale by WWW.Amazon. Com on DVD costs $134, and that's too much for any sensible (and impoverished) person to pay.

The movie is currently (2012) sold through Amazon. Com by ""Suzie Quik"" of California.

Too bad.

I saw this wonderful movie on television when I was a little boy in the 1950's, and remember every great moment of it. The music (Rodgers and Hart) and the acting are all breathtaking.

But the movie ""slipped between the cracks,"" and is largely forgotten in the present age when ""classics"" are listed many places, but never include this classic.

That is also true of Wake Up And Live (1937 Fox) starring Alice Faye, Jack Hailey, and Walter Winchell, another great movie almost never listed and discussed when ""great movies"" are ranked and publicized.

The movie is currently (2012) sold through Amazon. Com by ""Suzie Quik"" of California. It is presently for sale at the whopping price of $135.99, two bucks more than The Boys From Syracuse (1940 Universal) starring Alan Jones and Martha Raye.

It may be that people operating the ""Suzie Quik"" movie sales service specialize in hard to get movies sold at huge prices. By any measure, $134. and $136 are huge prices, even for rich people.

Hopefully this will change.

The days of ""cheap good movies"" may be coming to an end, and all this could be a signal about that.

It is well to remember that the history of movies includes a vast number of creations, some of which were and are dazzling, but unknown and largely unavailable to the general public, and even to those few who do know about the ""unavailable, unpublicized classic movies.""
