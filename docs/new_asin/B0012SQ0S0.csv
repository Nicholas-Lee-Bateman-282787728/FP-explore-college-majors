Video quality is typical of a standard DVD but audio is one of the best I have heard from standard DVD.  This is a great performance by Alan Curtis and Ann Hallenberg.

This is highly recommended since there is no other video of Ariondante available.",1490572800,,454,4.5
8247701,4,B0012SQ0S0,"Well, it's a fine opera and the production is visually rich, but there are NO subtitles.  So, you'll need to read the story first and then just go along for the ride.  Most librettos aren't exactly Montaigne-like in introspection or wisdom, so sometimes NOT knowing the story is a plus (she said ""what??""), but not on first viewing.  Wrote to Dynamic and told them to consider making subtitled versions available.  They said they were working on something, but that doing this was more complex than anticipated.  At the price, I really can't complain too much.  Here's an idea: have some friends over, pour the vodka liberally and give prizes for the best imagined lines in key scenes.",1417737600,8,685,4.811965811965812
