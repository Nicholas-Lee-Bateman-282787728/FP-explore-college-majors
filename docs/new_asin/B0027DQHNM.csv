8354619,4,B0027DQHNM,"This box set contains 3 previously released opera DVDs in their original DVD cases, housed in a thin cardboard box. All operas are available on Amazon individually.

THE OPERAS ARE:

MADAMA BUTTERFLY by Puccini (4.0 stars)  2004
Fiorenza Cedolins is Butterfly. Marcello Giordani is Pinkerton. Juan Pons is Sharpless. Daniel Oren conducts the Orchestra of the Arena di Verona. Franco Zeffirelli directs the stage. The sound is picked up well. Cedolins sings well, and so does Giordani, mostly. The acting is acceptable. Zeffirelli's lavish staging is slightly overdone.

AIDA by Verdi (4.4 stars)  1992
Maria Chiara is Aida. Kristjn Jhannsson is Radams. Dolora Zajick is Amneris. Nello Santi conducts the Orchestra of the Arena di Verona. This is a visual extravaganza on a giant outdoor stage. The singing and acting are mostly excellent.

8354620,2,B0027DQHNM,"I previously reported that ""Aida"" was defective.  I discovered yesterday that the second of the three CDs, this one ""Tosca,"" is also defective,  During two play-throughs  it stopped twice.  Fortunately, it appeared to have started each time where it left off, whereas after the four stops on the ""Aida"" disc It appeared to have lost some of the program.",1495670400,,353,4.932203389830509
8354621,4,B0027DQHNM,"This was a gift for my wife, who has seen several of the operas in this box set at the Verona Arena in Italy. She has only watched the Madame Butterfly DVD so far but the disc skipped and froze badly. We returned the set and the replacement disc also skipped and froze so we wrote it off as a manufacturing defect and decided to keep it and live with it. My wife also said the opera was edited and shortened, which was not noted anywhere on Amazon or on the packaging. She loved the performance though: so,5 stars for the (trimmed) performance but the discs themselves only get 2.",1420416000,,580,4.281818181818182
8354622,4,B0027DQHNM,"While Verona is known to be mostly above the political fray that plagues Italian productions, it is still not immune to the name recognition plague that locks listeners into years of sub-standard singers using rinse and repeat tactics.  The conducting is worth the price of admission though...",1387929600,,293,5.23404255319149
