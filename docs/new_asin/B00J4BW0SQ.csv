6333197,4,B00J4BW0SQ,"Great collection and price. For the record I got this elsewhere with some trepidation after reading reviews here. My main interest was TGE in Blu Ray The set has 1 disc per movies as others have said despite the description. I played TGE chapter by chapter and I found the picture quality actually very good. I also played my old DVD the same way and that was vey grainy and in places unwatchable by comparison. I expected better with upscaling but the Blu Ray here is much better. I'm no expert. You should also be aware there is a d Day remembered set that includes TGE and Battle of Britain in Blu Ray. Both movies should demand a high quality Blu Ray release and are long overdue INMO. I already had TM7 in Blue Ray in another set so Thomas Crown and Sand Peebles were just extras for me.

I dropped 1 star because I fail to understand how such a collection would fail to include Bullitt and  of the Cincinnati Kid booth which are available in Blue Ray. Would have paid twice the price if those were included. Please excuse typos/ grammar  errors which are due to disability.

6333204,4,B00J4BW0SQ,"As a fan of the late, great actor Steve McQueen, I rejoiced recently when I discovered the ""Steve McQueen Collection,"" a compilation of four of Steve McQueen's best movies: ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Magnificent Seven,"" ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" and ""The Sand Pebbles.""

""THE GREAT ESCAPE:"" This film is based on a true story - the mass escape of Allied prisoners of war from a German camp (Stalag Luft III) in Poland. McQueen plays American aviator Virgil Hiltz, who has already become the bane of his German captors because of his many escape attempts. He continues his efforts in this new ""escape-proof"" Stalag, where his activities and his contemptuous attitude toward his captors earn him much time in the ""cooler.""  McQueen is superb in his relatively small part in this classic 1963 World War II thriller.

""THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960):"" Here is a western from 1960, in which McQueen plays Vin Tanner, one of seven gunslingers who volunteer to go to a border town in Mexico to protect that town's citizens from a gang of marauders led by the ruthless ""Calvera"" (played by Eli Wallach.) ""The Magnificent Seven"" also features Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn.  Here is a wonderfully written and acted classic western that has clearly defined heroes, villains, and victims.

""THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (1968):"" This is probably the coolest part ever played by the ""King of Cool."" McQueen is Thomas Crown, a wealthy Boston business executive who plans and executes the heist of nearly 3 million dollars in cash from a bank, ""for the fun of it."" The heist goes off without a hitch. When the police fail to turn up any clues as to who committed the crime, the bank's insurance company pays off, and then brings in a beautiful private investigator named Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway) to solve the case. Sparks fly as she quickly focuses on Crown as her chief suspect, and uses every means possible to prove his guilt. Overall, this movie is okay, although it tends to be rather slow-moving at times. The on-screen chemistry between McQueen and Dunaway is superb.

""THE SAND PEBBLES (1966):"" This is by far the best of the films in this collection, and unquestionably the finest role of Steve McQueen's career. He plays Jake Holman, a disaffected ""China Sailor"" newly assigned to a gunboat patrolling the waterways of China in the 1920s. McQueen earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his performance as the embittered loner who battles everyone around him, as well as himself.

""The Steve McQueen Collection"" brings some of the very best of Steve McQueen into one Blu-ray case. Each of the four films is excellent in its own right, made all the better by the actor known as the ""King of Cool."" Highly recommended.",1427414400,5,2735,4.881465517241379
6333205,1,B00J4BW0SQ,"The discs are ok, but is really disappointing the awful state in which it arrived.",1425081600,,82,4.533333333333333
6333206,5,B00J4BW0SQ,I love this book.,1424217600,,17,3.5
6333207,5,B00J4BW0SQ,"Not many actors had a screen presence like Steve McQueen. THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE GREAT ESCAPE, THE SAND PEBBLES and THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR are four films in which Steve McQueen's demonstrates his charisma and power to capture the viewer's attention in every frame he is in.

I believe it is the nature of the THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN gunfighters, their motives for that one chance at gallantry and redemption. That combined with the way the story is visually told makes for its greatness. It teaches us something about nobility, dignity and devotion. The hearse-ride taken up to Boot Hill with Yul Brynner driving and Steve McQueen riding shotgun sets the stage and tone for the entire film. Images such as when Charles Bronson, is bent over with a bullet inside and the three little Mexican boys clutch him crying out his name while in his death throes bring a tear to the eye. In another the viewer reflects along with Yul Brynner as he takes the lifeless James Coburn's knife out of the adobe wall and folds it gently in his hand. These are heart rendering and indelible images. Even Eli Wallach as the bandit Calvera gets his moment of pathos. After being mortally wounded by Yul Brynner's bullet, Calvera can not believe that the seven came back to save the village even after the villagers told them that they did not want their help anymore. ""You came back. A man like you. Why?"" asks Calvera as he dies. Yul Brynner has no answer for him. It was as if Brynner had committed some sacrilege.

Director John Sturges captured the ambiguities of the human spirit in this film.
For me Yul Brynner was the epitome of `cool' and aplomb. From his dark gray and black outfit down to the tip of his thin cheroot he was the kind of man others look up to but keep their distance. Yul Brynner as Chris, was a man of few words and often communicated by the mere gesture of the hand. Of the seven, he was the cohesive element that drew them together simply by his demeanor. The aura of his worldliness beckoned them all to the place he was heading. He was just the first to recognize it. Brynner too was the cohesive element that kept them all together. Brynner was the one who followed some unwritten code of honor that is only alluded to in a few passages. McQueen was perfect as the gunfighter who was ""just drifting"" and signed on with Brynner. The levelheaded McQueen represents the other characters' realizations one by one as they join. James Coburn was perfect, as the stoic knife throwing Britt, who lived only for the thrill of the moment. Charles Bronson as O'Reilly played his stoically rugged but sympathetic role better than any actor could have. Bronson had a unique visual presence whose kind facial expressions counterbalanced his pockmark face and strong physique. Bronson was a conundrum unto himself and perfect for the role. Brad Dexter's performance as the unlucky fortune hunter has gone unrecognized. He was the least noble of the seven and died the mercenary to the end. Still, he gains our sympathy after returning in the clutch and saves his friend Chris and in turn is killed. Dying in the arms of his friend, Chris lets him go to the grave with a lie. Robert Vaughn's character was probably the most interesting of the seven. His enigmatic portrayal of Lee the tormented soul and not really the coward he labeled himself somehow never stood out. Only his act of redemption, his gun play and death during the finale lingers. Vaughn's portrayal is a success because as he said he was ""the coward hiding out in the middle of a battlefield"" and at that he succeeded. Horst Buchholz gave an energetic and bravura performance the only one of the seven that had not yet been corrupted by the world. At the end he symbolically hangs his guns up and roles up his sleeves. Brynner and McQueen say that ""only the farmers have won"" and they lost.

I have fond memories of THE GREAT ESCAPE. THE GREAT ESCAPE is director John Sturges' brilliant film presentation of the absorbing Paul Brickhill Book. John Sturges effectively retells the story from the script by James Clavell and W.R. Burnett, which is a condensation of events and people taken from the book. The film deals with the lives and efforts of the Allied POW's to escape from a German prison camp. We do not see John Sturges take any side in this film. Only near the end of the film does he begin to make a political statement on Nazism and its effect on traditional German military ethics and the lives of the captured Allies. Sturges' focus is more on the men caught in war and its effects on them. We see the men rely on dormant qualities they never knew existed until they put on a uniform and were captured and held in foreign territory. We see men going to extreme lengths to escape because of their inborn right to be free. This is represented by Steve McQueen's character Hilts otherwise known as the ""Cooler King,"" Charles Bronson as Danny and Angus Lennie as Ives the ""The Mole."" We see other men going to equal lengths to escape and cause havoc behind enemy lines by diverting German troops from the front to recapture them. This is the main purpose of the escape and Richard Attenborough as the ""Big X"" orchestrates the overall plan. He calls upon every expertise of the prisoners to reach this one goal. He calls upon tailors, forgers, scroungers, tinkers, and engineers, just about anyone capable of getting the job done. These are portrayed by James Garner, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn, David McCallum, John Leyton, Gordon Jackson, Tom Adams, Nigel Stock and others.

For years this was considered a great World War II action adventure film, but John Sturges' reaches far above that mundane distinction. His style and ease of direction glosses over his own profound statements that he makes in this film. For example, James Garner cleverly befriends a German guard for the sole purpose of stealing his wallet so he can extort a 35-mm. camera and film from the guard. On the surface the audience is very amused at Garner's sly tactics, after all the Germans are the bad guys. However, subconsciously Sturges gave us enough personal information about the guard that we almost feel sympathy for him. This is reinforced by Sturges' choice of James Garner, one of the most likable actors in Hollywood, to perpetrate the deception on the unknowing guard. How can a nice guy like James Garner do this? As it works out Sturges lets the guard redeem himself. It is this guard that discovers the first tunnel when he spills some coffee on the floor and it disappears through the cracks. Now you the viewer are faced with a moral dilemma. Do I still feel sympathy for the guard? Do I still think that James Garner is a scoundrel? Or do I think that in war I have to do what is necessary? Garner's character did what he had to do and so did the guard.

Editor Ferris Webster did an excellent job of putting this complex story together giving it coherence and drive yet never sacrificing any of the wonderful characterizations that is the backbone of this film. Daniel Fapp's cinematography brilliantly gives us a feeling of claustrophobia while in the prison camp. Once the escape begins he gives us panoramas of landscapes which have a dual symbolism. On one emotional hand we are free and the far-off horizons elusively symbolize that freedom. On the other rational hand we know that we are still not free and the vastness of those landscapes only strengthens the reality that ultimate escape and freedom is improbable for the majority of the escapees.

Composer Elmer Bernstein also has more to say than meets the ear. His main title theme is as much a tribute to the prisoners in this story as it is to all men who must overcome the odds through their own perseverance and unwillingness to bend to defeat to whatever noble end they strive for. Bernstein's complex score complements the theme by giving us passages and statements on the diversity of the individuals as well as their singular overall objective. Once ""on the road"" the music reaches exhilarating proportions unlike that of traditional action Hollywood scoring. Bernstein wants to put the audience through the same suspense and anticipation that the escapees feel and then unleashes our pent up emotions in a crescendo of rousing orchestrations that has us cheering them on.

THE SAND PEBBLES is a very effective historically based narrative focusing on China during the 1926 revolution as seen through and affecting the U.S.S. San Pablo assigned to patrol the Yangtze River. This richly textured Robert Wise film is full of many interesting performances especially from Richard Crenna, Mako, Richard Attenborough and Simon Oakland, and especially Steve McQueen. Richard Crenna's character as the Captain of the San Pablo is truly enigmatic and somehow parallels that of Steve McQueen's seaman Jake Holman who is not restrained from doing the right thing when diplomacy dictates otherwise. Steve McQueen is ordered to the San Pablo for his transgressions and comes to terms with his own cynicism and outward lack of humanity, which has been beaten into his misunderstood past. His relationship with the Mako, whom he trains to maintain the ship's engine makes McQueen see the humanity in himself and those of a different race and culture and realizes the basic good in himself. Mako's tragic death seen is very moving and unforgettable if you have ever seen this film and McQueen's agony touches you like no other film I have ever seen. This film contains one of Jerry Goldsmith's best scores full of brooding bravado and sentiment. This is also one of the best films Robert Wise directed and he truly directed some great ones. THE SAND PEBBLES is a very soul searching and unforgettable film.

After so many years I find myself returning to THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR again and again and again. There is a certain lure to this film. I was young then and as I get older look back at things I remember and savor. THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR was a highly stylistic film; the direction, the split screens, the score, the editing, the dialogue, the high fashion, McQueen, Dunaway, the glider, the beach, the dune buggy, Noel Harrison, the caper, ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" and so much more.

If you love the 60s and the transition from old school to a new direction, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR had it all and stood at that pivotal point in filmmaking, but more importantly at a point of a society's uncertain direction and future, but perhaps at a time we could just enjoy all the excesses and romance and special moments of a wink or a smile and perhaps a kiss. The film is unique because it stands frozen in time because of its transitional nature, yet at the same time, it stands entirely on its own for everything you see and feel watching this film and later, years later, savoring that special moment. I love it. I have to. It is part of me, and part of my youth and part of growing up. It's in me. That's the thing about films and times. Director Norman Jewison; this guy made films that touched me. I like almost all his film, but I love THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR in particular. This one is so special. There will never be a 1960s again. There will never be that special moment again. I love to think that I was there and felt it and now look back it and love those times.",1424131200,2,11310,4.690835850956697
6333208,5,B00J4BW0SQ,"For years, my father swore that Steve McQueen was the best action star in the later part of the 20th century. It was not until my 27th year on this earth that I really took his words to heart. After watching each film in this collection and others as well I can safely confirm that my father was 100% correct.

Steve McQueen commands your attention every time he is in a scene. Everything about him is better than the next guy. He had the lines, the looks and the moves. Even when he was at his worst, it was better than a lot of actors at their best. To put the icing on the cake, he is in some of the best action scenes including car chases of any film. Sorry Fast and Furious series but you can't touch Bullet. Even my previous favorite car film, Gone in 60 seconds does not have a better scene. That part where his Mustang is coming over the hill in San Fransisco is just pure Nirvana.",1424044800,8,889,4.138728323699422

If you just want to watch the films and get a decent one or two in there then it's fine. TMS is already on bluray, and besides The Thomas Crown Affair, is the only film that looks good to great. The Great Escape has not be given its due restoration and suffers from low bitrate and very weak master, whatever was used. The Sand Pebbles is MPEG-2 plus low bitrate and not really worth it imo. I think we all need to remember that 4K is coming soon and certainly TGE will be remastered in a much finer release.

So is the entire set worth it? IDK. For me the only film I want out of this as they are presented is The Magnificent Seven, and I already have it for 5 bucks. It's up to you I'm just here to warn you of the deficiencies of such a set.",1419292800,44,874,3.937853107344633
