3929076,2,B002HGRI7S,All the moves are too fast and I hate the organization of the DVD very confusing for me.  I am new at Pilates though.,1390521600,3,117,3.875
3929077,4,B002HGRI7S,"This video will be great once I advance beyond a beginner level.  She does describe each movement so that you can follow if you already familiar with the Pilates method.  Some have described her as annoying.  I wouldn't say that at all.  She has a rhythm to her voice and description of the exercises.  If you need a challenging PURE Pilates workout from an instructor that trained under Pilates protege, then this is the video for you.  I am looking forward to getting to this level.",1362182400,5,484,4.569767441860465
3929078,5,B002HGRI7S,"When I first used this DVD I noticed that my body was tired afterwards and I felt like I had a pretty good workout but it wasn't till the next day that I realized just how much I did work out. I've been doing pilates for a year now and I have used the other Element's Pilates DVD for beginners (which I love) and this was a step up from it! So if we're looking for a first time Pilates experience then I'd suggest the other DVD by Elements because this one is more advanced.
You definitely have to stick with both DVD's to see results, you can't expect overnight changes. And if you feel like you're having trouble and 'not feeling the burn' while working out then your doing more of the motion than the actual workout. The abs is the one that I have this problem with most common. If it helps, just try to focus on one muscle group at a time (like abs, glutes, thighs, etc) and make sure that while doing any of the movement that you're working that specific area.
If you don't feel much even then, well I'd seek professional help or maybe something different for you.
If you don't understand that difference between Pilates and Yoga, the best way I can explain is that Pilates is definitely more muscle use and control while Yoga is more stretching and relaxing. Yoga can help build up muscle too, but Pilates is a more complex version of it, in my opinion. I've done both and Pilates helps build up your strength more and help shape your body.
Last March I started dieting and then a few month later I started the Element Pilates for beginners and so far I have lost about 15 pounds. I definitely would of lost more of that just dieting (which I did, I lost 20 originally), but when I really got the hang of Pilates I gained about 5 pounds in just muscle. I've noticed that I have built up muscle throughout my entire body and my waist is really defined now that I have a nice hour glass figure that I didn't originally have.
So I encourage you to try this and not give up! I'll admit that I've gotten lazy, bored, and tired of doing all the routines so I decided that I'd break it up and only do a few a night that work whatever it is that I want to work. I still haven't made it all the way through the beginners DVD because I just choose a few a night and call it good. That helps me from getting bored or finding excuses that it's not working. Since I change it up it keeps my body on an irregular schedule so it's not in the habit of doing that same thing time and again so I still end up loosing wait and gaining muscle.
Anyways, I'm sorry I ranted on but again I hope you try it and not give up! Only you alone can loose wait and it has to be something you actually WANT to do, not because you feel you need to. Once you realize this and focus on it just for yourself, you'll be surprised how easy you can shape your body to how YOU want it to be shaped.",1336348800,4,2864,4.125223613595707
3929079,4,B002HGRI7S,"I've been doing the Element Pilates for Beginners for almost 2 years and decided to move up to this more advanced workout.  It's a tougher workout in a shorter time, I do it 5x's a week, and after only 3 weeks, I'm already seeing and feeling the results.  This dvd is not for beginners! I would perfect the Element Beginners DVD before moving onto this one, the moves are more advanced, and so is the way the instructor gives direction.  You need to know what your doing to follow along.",1302393600,8,487,4.388888888888889
3929080,2,B002HGRI7S,"I consider myself at a medium level of fitness and I felt like a I got the bare minimum workout with a very modest sweat factor.

The instructor is non annoying but - as others have noted - I really could have used a consistent count throughout so I didn't have to keep trying to watch the tv the whole time for an even number of repetitions on each side.

The exercises without the ""reformer"" - I'm not that familiar with this equipment but - were pretty useless for me.  The instructor notes on some moves that they can optionally be done with light weights but unless you are at the physical therapy level (in my mind meaning you can barely lift your arms or manage the range of motion and are trying to recover from something) no amount of tightening and resistance could make the move worthwhile without weights.  That said, some of the moves are at rather awkward angles for serious weights so - again as noted by the instructor - we're talking small 2 lbs or something maximum.

So for all those times I started sweating because there were some tough moves, there were too many chunks of time that I found almost useless.

All in all, not a keeper for me.",1279843200,8,1162,4.381395348837209
3929081,5,B002HGRI7S,"I prefer pilates routines that work the entire body.  Many pilates routines don't seem to do much for the arms (beyond the occasional pilates plank).  I think this routine effectively hits all the muscles, and definately devotes more than the average amount of time to the arms.  Of course, being a Pilates routine, it focuses the most exercises on the core.  Some sample moves are the One Hundred, leg circles, Pilates planks, Teasers, and a six step series of flowing arm movements.  It doesn't say beginner in the title for a reason - I think it is more for those familiar with pilates already.  The instructor tells you the names of the moves as she does them, but doesn't say much else.  I appreciate this approach, so I can focus on form and breathing.  I do this aproximately 35 minute routine on a regular basis, and feel it stretches me out.",1271116800,17,850,4.582781456953643
3929082,3,B002HGRI7S,"The workout sequence was challenging and enjoyable, but her instruction isn't help or clear.  She doesn't help you time breath or the how many reps. Her personality is a bit intense. I wouldn't recommend this to friends.",1270944000,15,220,4.945945945945946
3929083,5,B002HGRI7S,Received item very quickly.  Was very happy with purchase.  Would do business again.,1267747200,,84,5.384615384615385
3929084,5,B002HGRI7S,"See my review on : [...].

Perfect for a quick workout. I felt energized and refreshed after completing. LOVED IT.",1267056000,,114,4.7
3929085,5,B002HGRI7S,"This is a great DVD, especially for those that don't have a lot of time to exercise or just can't make themselves do a 50 minute work out. This DVD is a total of 38 minutes, the actual workout being slightly shorter. The moves can cause injury, so beginners should be careful. Don't be discouraged if you can't at first do the moves, working towards them still helps you to get the figure you want! I used Brooke Siler's ""Pilates for Weight Loss: Beginners"" over the summer and lost 8 pounds in a few weeks and didn't gain any weight until Thanksgiving, even though I hadn't done pilates since July. It makes you feel revitalized and boosts morale, making you happier and feel more worthwhile. This is how I keep my morale up during the college semester!",1263254400,26,754,4.510948905109489
8370321,2,B002HGRI7S,Has great moves but she goes way to fast. She also doesn't explain what she is doing very well.,1474243200,2,95,4.052631578947368

8370323,5,B002HGRI7S,This is a great workout. It's very challenging.,1441756800,,47,5.0
8370324,3,B002HGRI7S,"Not my favorite pilates dvd. Instructor goes very quickly. I believe if someone isn't careful, it is possible to get injured because of the quick reps. I am able to keep up with other exercise dvd's but with this one, it is really hard unless I am watching the tv. It might be better to watch the entire dvd at least once before trying. The early exercises are great for adductors.",1424476800,5,381,4.380281690140845
8370325,5,B002HGRI7S,"Amazing video! Its only 35 minutes but she reviews your classical pilates teaser, ab work, stretches and ends with lunges and burpes. You'll definetly break a sweat. I however say this is more intermediate not for beginners.",1407888000,3,224,5.081081081081081
8370326,3,B002HGRI7S,"not as good as the inflatable ball video from the same people. She does sets of 3 reps and by the time you have figured out what she is doing, she is done. It was not at the caliber of other videos imo.",1406937600,3,202,3.7209302325581395
8370327,5,B002HGRI7S,Very good; just what I expected.,1405900800,,32,4.5

8370329,5,B002HGRI7S,I would recommend this video to the more advanced pilates students; not necessarily for beginners.  This instructor does a great job.,1401926400,3,133,5.333333333333333
8370330,5,B002HGRI7S,Love this DVD.  It walks you through various Pilates exercises that will help slim and tone you. The instructor is a 2nd generation Pilates instructor and knows what she is doing.,1401062400,,179,4.774193548387097
