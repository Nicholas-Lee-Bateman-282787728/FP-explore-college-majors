6016508,5,B00FOSHAVA,Anyone who posted the negative reviews about particular episodes clearly didn't understand the point of the show. It isn't supposed to be funny all the time. Each episode is meant to tell it's own self contained story and the tone and genre of each is meant to be different. There is always a comedy element in there somewhere but they don't all have to be like L.o. G. to be good. Honestly I loved this and I can't wait for season two to come out!!,1431388800,2,449,4.294117647058823
6016509,4,B00FOSHAVA,"The 1st 4 episodes were great. The last 2 were ok. I wish there were more shows like this and Black Mirror. With the exception of a rare American gem like Breaking Bad, BBC blows US tv away big time. Just look at BBC shows US producers keep trying to remake that epically fail.",1426377600,,277,4.148148148148148

6016511,5,B00FOSHAVA,The second episode about the burglars is absolutely brilliant.,1420416000,,62,6.0
6016512,3,B00FOSHAVA,"The first episode was really funny, the second was funny, but not as funny as the first, and it just kept going down from there. I'm a huge fan of the League, but with this series I felt like most of the skits were drug out to the 30 minutes. They could have easily cut down to 2 fifteen minute sketches per episode and it would have been gold.",1410480000,,344,4.0
6016513,5,B00FOSHAVA,"Brilliant and twisted self-contained gems. Wonderful writing and acting. I will be watching them all. Thank you, BBC!",1407110400,,117,5.555555555555555
6016514,5,B00FOSHAVA,"If you are a fan of the League of Gentlemen and/or Psychoville, you will love this show.  Every episode is top notch.  I'm only disappointed that Series 2 isn't also available to stream.",1478476800,,186,4.606060606060606

6016521,5,B00FOSHAVA,"I love them from ""The League Of The Gentleman"". They are my favorite. British comedy is something special",1439856000,,105,4.888888888888889
6016522,5,B00FOSHAVA,"The episodes of this series are a divergence from standard TV fare. They are as close as one can get to traditional short stories and the type of literature they represent.

Each episode has the common organization plan of the short story. The ground is set, the characters are introduced, the issue or a complication is introduced, a crisis or two looms, there are signs and then appearance of a climax and then there may or may not be a resolution, a moral, a sense of wonder, anger, pity, awe, disgust, horror or amusement.

And all that happens within thirty minutes of slow or fast possible real life or impossible real life situations which move as fast or as slow as their wont.

The writers have moved beyond literature into the realm of moving pictures or they have moved from moving pictures into the realm of literature successfully. The fact that they appear as the characters, the heroes or the anti-heroes, the narrators and the actors, the audience and the pictures on the screen adds to the flavour of the viewer being able to identify with them no matter how grotesque, macabre or common place they may be.

The episodes/stories show conscious or Freudian or maybe even Jungian influences of Edgar Allan Poe, Lord Dunsany, H.H. Munro, John Collier, Robert Bloch, or just the depravity of the creator(s).

They have a sense of humour, a sense of the absurd, a sense of skepticism, a sense of stoicism, a sense of dread and a feeling of the human condition turning into inhuman proportions within a few minutes.

I thoroughly enjoyed all the episode, some more than others but would not have wanted to miss any just as I would not wish to have missed reading an Ambrose Bierce short story. My last remark brings to mind ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" which has absolutely no similarities to any of the episodes I watched but somehow belongs with them.

I found it as much a pleasure to write this review as I did to watch the episodes of ""Inside No. 9""",1431993600,5,1972,4.617142857142857
6016523,4,B00FOSHAVA,"very odd, quirky show but worth the effort i thought.  especially liked the silent episode ! but then I have been told that I have a somewhat sick sense of humor so be warned, not everyone will find this series amusing.,",1431648000,2,220,4.365853658536586

I always find it interesting that someone would be so concerned that in one of the fictional stories an animal is hurt. No mention that there were people in the stories that were hurt or damaged, or killed in some way. This story is fictional. The animal was not actually hurt. The people were not actually hurt. I found the plots clever, interesting, funny, and well written!!! Five Star rating from me",1521763200,,444,4.632911392405063
8617475,4,B00FOSHAVA,Great show!  A little cheesy in parts but overall it retains an excellent balance of humor and shock,1517875200,,100,4.555555555555555
8617476,5,B00FOSHAVA,These guys really know what they're doing. Reminds me of the old Alfred Hitchcock series. Equally funny and awful. Great fun!,1513641600,,125,5.0
8617477,1,B00FOSHAVA,"Rather bizarre, sometimes distasteful and  or violent, not as good as my many other UK TV favorites.",1513209600,,100,4.882352941176471
8617478,1,B00FOSHAVA,"While this is a very well written and out of the box series, there is a scene where an animal is deliberately hurt--I would have enjoyed this series, but will not finish it now.  Animal abuse is not funny.",1510963200,2,205,4.256410256410256

8617481,5,B00FOSHAVA,"I watched this show on hulu and i absolutely loved it. Mind you it's not for everyone, it's really weird, the scenarios are all ""WTF!!"", but, therein lies the comedic brilliance. Most shows in this genre tend to over exaggerate the weirdness, although Inside No. 9 pushes the envelope quite a bit, they know just when to reign it in",1497225600,,332,4.55
8617482,5,B00FOSHAVA,A British gal I met in Scotland was posting about this series and how excited she was for season 3.  I purchased the first episode for immediate viewing and watched all six stories in one sitting!  I actually watched eight because I made my husband watch two  of them right after I was done and I stayed in the room with him.  ;),1483660800,2,329,4.174603174603175
