8526181,5,B0088XQBJK,"Awesome! Presents the subject of Western men going to the FSU to find a wife in a subjective light, allowing the men and their experiences to tell the story.
On a personal note: I have NEVER understood why Western men think that just because women are from what is considered an impoverished country, they are submissive and have never been introduced to the ""feminist movement"".
  The movie deals mostly with the men, their misguided ideas about Russian women, and their desperate attempts to find a women who looks like Miss Universe and has the sensibilities of June Cleaver.
Only a small portion deals with the mail order bride business itself and the possibility that it misrepresents the women on its website by having the interpreters (instead of the ""brides"" themselves) write all of the emails to the men.
One of the best documentaries on the subject I have ever seen!",1406505600,,877,4.84

8526183,4,B0088XQBJK,"I rented this DVD from my local library prior to my 4th visit to Ukraine 4 months ago (6/2013).
  I've met several women from Marriage sites in Ukraine and in Russia. Some of the most fun I ever experienced just for the record. What this DVD is all about is a group of men from USA and Europe that is on a Marriage Tour provided by the well known Dating/Marriage site Anastasidate.com. It shows how men set up dates, the conflicts of communication, cultural differences, and an insight of what this particular website ""Anastasidate.com"" has to offer if one decide to purchase a tour package.

  This DVD is very very informative for a man who is interested in meeting an Ukrainian woman for marriage via the internet. What I like about this DVD is the true issues men has with understanding women and relationships from a whole different culture. It also has some reactions from Ukrainian men and their ideas of foreigners coming to their country to meet the women, girls who openly admit they are on the website for money, and the fraud that's goes into it. It also does an excellent job in showing the beautiful city of Odessa, Ukraine.

I give it 4 stars for the information. It's not a DVD where one would treat as if it's a movie or a reality show. It's based strictly on information. Perhaps why I saw it in the reference section of my library.",1381104000,,1350,4.512295081967213
