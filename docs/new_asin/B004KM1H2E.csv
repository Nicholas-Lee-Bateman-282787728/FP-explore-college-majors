8433093,4,B004KM1H2E,"The humorous story revolves around an illiterate, timid, man in India  who is a doormat for everyone, including his thieving twin brother and his brother's shrewish wife. The village where they live is apparently going through a drought and the government will pay for building wells. With the help of his uppity daughter and a savvy mechanic, he navigates the Indian bureaucracy with its in- your- face corruption. He slowly develops a backbone and eventually out maneuvers the corrupt individuals. There's a symbolic scene at the end where all the corrupt officials are on a stand built for the occasion by one of the thieving, inept, officials. With so many people on it, the whole thing collapses. It's all done very well. In fact it was devoid of the usual irritating outburst of mass singing and dancing that characterizes so many of the Bollywood films (except for the celebration in the caravan, which makes sense with the story).

I have only two minor objections and that is with the subordinate love story which was unconvincing. The would-be groom was un appealing, in my opinion. The other was a missed opportunity by the director in letting the honest police office at the end not come to the obvious conclusion.

It's amusing hearing English intermixed with Hindi in everyday speech. I'm told that this is commonplace.",1413936000,,1333,4.941964285714286
8433094,4,B004KM1H2E,"I didn't think much about the movie for the initial part as it was a bit slow for my liking but then the twist in the story made it very interesting to watch. It is worth every penny. A true reflection of Hindi Cinema and the movie takes a dig at day to day life of a man grappling with corruption at every level of the system. Boman Irani played the role to perfection and his other role distinguished properly in its attire,and behaviour by the director. Ila Arun was at her amazing best. Most of the star cast is from his previous movie Welcome to Sajjanpur. The sort of movie you would expect from a master like Shyam Benegal. A MUST WATCH...",1304640000,2,646,4.260162601626016
8433095,5,B004KM1H2E,"This is a very enjoyable satire / comedy. Mostly tongue in cheek. With quite a serious background though. In fact, quite a lot of serious background. The ""well"" of its title can be interpreted as either an appraisal of ""Abba"" or as a reference to the much needed water. Your pick. At one point, the story goes deliberately for the absurd and one doesn't mind coming along for the ride. We have all had our share of dealing with bureaucrats and often wished we could avenge ourselves in coin. There is little dancing. And the music is pleasant to unremarkable. Boman Irani as twin brothers Armaan and Rehman is a lot of fun. Quite restrained yet very effective. Minissha Lamba plays Armaan's clever daughter and is delightful. After some initial quarrels she eventually takes to charming orphan Arif (Sammir Dattani) and one can only applaud her for this decision. Of the very able supporting cast I'd like to mention just a few: Ila Arun (Rehman's shrew of a wife), Rajit Kapoor (the gradually overwhelmed police inspector), Rajendra Gupta (Irrigation Minister of the plastic smile). You, too, will smile whilst watching this film. The ""Making of"" section on the DVD is quite interesting.",1298851200,,1188,4.8861386138613865
