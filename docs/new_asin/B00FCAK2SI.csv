8614362,1,B00FCAK2SI,"No matter what you may think you will not find a bigger fan of Tammy than me. With that in mind WHEN is *Columbia Records/Epic Records and/or Legacy Records going to release Tammy's discography from the late 70's through the 80's. This is just another copy of what is already available under different titles. I've had these ever since they were first released on VHS and Tammy was still very much alive and still visiting the recording studio. Her ""fillers"" on her 70's and 80's are just as great as any of her documented hits throughout the years. In fact most are worthy of ""Greatest Hits and Rare Classics"" status. So again ""when"" will her discography be released on CD? What is being released over and over with a different title and picture are fantastic but it leads the average person believing these were the only gems Tammy ever released. Stop buying re-re-re-releases and maybe someone will get the picture and attempt to make a few dollars off of Tammy's ""Gems"" which are laying around in the music vaults slowly disintegrating. Just a bunch of *Greedy ignorant business execs which are typical MORONS and probably still wet behind the ears and pooping yellow!!! Only one star for greed and ignorance. Tammy deserves all the stars the heavens hold!",1382400000,10,1260,4.784403669724771
