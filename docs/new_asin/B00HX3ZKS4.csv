6242108,1,B00HX3ZKS4,"A show about three friends living and, as the title suggests (and the episodes so far seem to indicate), looking for (I suppose) love in San Francisco.  It's a concept that deserves the disaster its headed for.  For one thing, the 'looking' is confined to a very particular lifestyle which has yet to venture beyond clubs, bars, public baths and state-of-the-art hooking-up (via devices like iPhone, etc.): locations and methods which are hardly conducive to fidelity or monogamy. So when the main characters fail to find what they were 'looking' for, it quite frankly serves them right.

As for the main characters:
- one is unemployed, vaguely artistic, and in an open relationship with his boyfriend (an arrangement which he finds increasingly dissatisfying)
- one is an aging waiter with a vague ambition of opening a restaurant who has anonymous sex with men considerably younger than himself (although an older man, a florist, who might help him realize his ambition has caught his eye)
- one is a video game designer who is rather whinily (and somewhat half-heartedly) courting a hair-dresser/stylist/whatever whom he met on a bus, while alternately lusting after the boss at his video game-designing job.

All three are insecure and neurotic.  And talentless.  Painfully talentless.  Particularly the vaguely artistic one.  The florist only slightly redeems himself by becoming impatient with the aging waiter's nonsense.  The video game designer's boss seemed at first a promising counterpoint to his idiotic and doting employee, but now he is displaying insecurities of his own.  Otherwise the characters are aimless, ugly, not terribly literate, and seemingly lacking in any worthwhile touchstones.  And against the background of a washed out San Francisco (is this simply the color-grading?) it's even more despicable.

With any luck HBO won't renew this insipid series.",1393632000,11,1882,5.299663299663299
6242109,5,B00HX3ZKS4,Wasn't quite sure what to expect after the first episode but the show is growing into its own. Give it a chance.  It is well worth watching and the characters are great and very hunky :-),1393113600,12,187,4.194444444444445
6242110,1,B00HX3ZKS4,"Really? the previous reviewer? are we watching the same show? Saw the first two episode. So wasteful of my time the worst thing is i could not unwatch!
really? JonathanGroff's character acts like he has just come out of the closet JUST beofe filming began...Hello? Going on a date and then googling uncut latino cocks? what is he teen ager? and he is a video game designer??????????

Let me recommend a far better TV show that was done in the 1990's it's called Tales of the city!
now google it!",1392595200,12,495,4.5
6242111,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"Sadly season one has concluded and like all grand ""soap operas"" the ending left relationships topsy turvy so now we keenly wait for season two to see what those crafty writers will come up with.  I have really enjoyed and heartily recommend LOOKING, an excellent new series with realistic, well-defined characters and situations that we can all identify with.  It mainly revolves around three quite different friends and their complex relationships and work day activities.  You're going to adore the just turned 40 Dom who is battling to set up his dream restaurant and though at first I wasn't too keen on nerdy Patrick, I now love this character. And who can resist Patrick's boss Trev with his anglo twang, cute stick out ears and delectable fleshy rump as displayed in episode eight.  Think it's well worth purchasing this series when it is released.  I have it on pre-order and can't wait to relive all the episodes in their entirety and savor the moments you often miss in a fast moving brief chapter.  Not unlike QUEER AS FOLK  but a lot more gritty and contemporary (and a hell lot more real!) as you would expect from Andrew Haigh of WEEKEND fame who is co-executive producer and director of the early episodes.  And being set and filmed in San Francisco (the location shooting is great and avoids the traditional picture postcard look of the city) is an obvious plus.  Unfortunately there are only eight episodes in season one but the great news is, LOOKING has been renewed for a second season!  And hopefully with more episodes.  Come on HBO, eight half-hour episodes, just whetting the appetite!!  From what I have seen from the first season, this series is one of the best, most entertaining and thoughtful gay-themed programs to hit our screens.",1392508800,50,1761,4.813953488372093
6242112,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"This topical show's biggest strength is it's honest portrayal of real gay men. Both the heterosexual stereotypes and our own don't apply here. This piece is about gay men single or not,who while they are fit and attractive, are not relentless body nazis. And (gasp) some of them are getting older in a youth obsessed culture. While it is topical and current many of the scenarios that play out her are timeless. The main character, subtlety played by Groth, often makes missteps in finding Mr. Right or even just Mr. Right now (he seems to be on Both sides of the fence). There is a couple who surprises themselves by bringing a third party in for a threesome. The best character for me, as a man of a certain age, is played by Bartlett. He can't seem to let go of how he was acting as a twenty five year old. All of these characters and situations ring true. And this series relevance brings to mind the old adage ""the more things may change the more they stay the same.if you need to have a frame of reference for this piece, view Andrew Heigh's movie weekend, I highly recommend it.",1391126400,101,1085,4.43

I can see why it got cancelled, even though the reaction to this show was really positive.  The characters were not really likeable and the storylines were not memorable.  It wasn't a bad show, it just didn't do anything original or leave you feeling moved at the end of any episodes.
It's hard to evoke sympathy for these guys when there's nothing too special or redeeming about them.  And, the actors were not very good when all is said and done.  I think the concept for the show was good; hopefully someone else will come along and pick up where this show failed!",1463356800,,668,4.277777777777778

6242163,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"When I first heard about Looking, Season 1, I admit that I was skeptical. I thought it would just be another cheap remake/spinoff of Queer As Folk or the gay version of Sex and the City. I was wrong. Yes it does remind me very much of a gay Sex and The City but is so much more than that and it truly pulled me in. It took me two years to finally get around to watching this after assuming it was just another gay series cut out of the same stereotypical gay mold. While it is very reminiscent of Sex and the City and how these ""girls"" deal with living single and looking for love, it also offers a bold, raw look at the gay lifestyle and everything that goes with it.

The standout for me in this series is the love affair between Patrick and Richie. Two people from two different backgrounds working through their differences to find true love. Truly amazing! I love Richie's genuine nature and how he reels in Patrick with it, only to find that Patrick resists because he may not know a good thing when he sees it.",1455580800,,1017,4.2153846153846155
6242164,5,B00HX3ZKS4,Finally I a tv show that once again decided to be bold and daring!,1454457600,,66,3.7857142857142856
6242165,3,B00HX3ZKS4,"Being a gay man, I enjoyed seeing images of myself.  However the writers chose to represent a few stereotypes and not half as many of what Mart Crowley did in his play/ movie, BOYS IN THE BAND and he did it in less than two and half hours.  LOOKING was limited in its scope and I will miss it, but I see why it was canceled.  I am starved for any image of my life, but this is not it.  Too many scenes were unrealistic.  One glaring example is the characters' source of money, I know for a fact that none of these men could have had the apartments they had in today's San Francisco.  It is just too expensive to live in San Francisco, and those who have never lived there will get a false hope that they can live like these characters.  In BOYS IN THE BAND the apartment DID reflect the income of Michael in the 1960s, LOOKING does not reflect even a fraction of what is a real gay world. The Gay world in this beautiful city is only for the very rich or the very poor, living from hand to mouth working 20 hours a day just to pay the rent.

Do not get me wrong, I will cherish my DVD and will probably purchase the second and final season, not because it is true, but because it is gay themed and the main characters do not die of AIDS.  This is all we have.  HBO was brave to do this, but also brave to have sense to cancel it.",1453852800,,1329,3.981132075471698
6242166,5,B00HX3ZKS4,I really fell in love with these characters and the show. It's a slice of life show about flawed guys (like the rest of us). I understand there will not be another season but a 'movie' that I assume will further the story.,1453420800,,222,4.186046511627907

I'm currently binge watching season 1 as we speak (I'm just about to watch the fifth episode out of eight) and this series seemed to be going so fast but it's so intriguing to say the least. The episodes are about 25 to 30 minutes each which helps with the quickness of binge watching. The characters are unique and different in each other's ways but also have similarities too.

Characters will suddenly be attracted to people far older than they are and of different races and enormous weight differences.  In some ideal world perhaps that could happen.

I appreciate the depiction of the honest difficulties of relationships and work, even though, I tire of the portrayal on television and movies of gay life through the eyes of emerging/young adults, even though I am one! I would have preferred if it was focused on Dom rather than Patrick; there seems to be a latent ageism (that only younger men can be gay or at least actively so) in this show. I can't wait to see how Dom's relationship with Lynn, an older man, develops (matures?) in the next season.

6242218,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"Made by HBO this has quality written all over it. Based in San Francisco we meet three gay friends Patrick, Augustin and Dom. They are all at the ages when life becomes more serious which normally coincides with your options getting ever limited. Dom is a waiter about to turn forty and he really wants to be his own boss and meet that certain someone. Patrick makes video games and is single but sometimes lacking belief in his own talent. He also has a new boss and he is not only young, good looking but English.

Then Augustin has met that special someone and set up home but seems to be pressing the self destruct button in everything he does almost as if he can't bear the thought of having it all. The three of them have their separate hills to climb and each other for support. This is the beginning of their stories.

This is just brilliant a rival to the original `Queer as folk' and it does have some sex based scenes but this is not a porn fest at all. It is all about relationships, life, dreams and the harsh realities of life. There are some great performances here - actually there is not one bad one. I loved seeing Scott Bakula as a special guest and also Russell Tovy keeping the Brit end up - if you will forgive the pun. They have made a second series too so hopefully this is one that is here to stay - at least for a while.",1430524800,2,1346,4.213178294573644

6242231,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"Season one is great at establishing the characters and the cast is mostly unknowns which only adds to believability of the scenes. I was taken in and surprised by the writing and acting. These people are real to me, and yes, I've made the same damned mistakes in my youth. The scenes with Patrick and Richie are my favorites. Beginning with the playful first meeting on the subway to the later that night meeting at the door of Esta Noches? Just look at Richie's smile. Episode 5 is perfect as we watch these guys get to know one another. You can see what a sweet, patient, loving but honest guy Richie is. Patrick is a prude, but that's part of his appeal for Richie. Patrick worries too much  about what people think and is unable to really give of himself. Richie though is a solid foundation on which to build a relationship. True, he's proud and stubborn, but this adds to his appeal. I've watched each episode numerous times and will continue to do so.  As they spend the day together they can see their differences but are they really that different? In episode 8 Patrick tries to make things right (after the wedding mess) and Richie is so cold to him and drives him away. Richie's too afraid of being hurt and he screws things up. It breaks my heart at the end of the episode when Richie tries to correct it by being honest about their differences. Although he says I'm this close to falling in love with you but I'm not gone to let that happen because you're not ""ready."" I can see that it's already too late because he IS in love with him. He hesitates hoping Patrick will say something. But Patrick can only tear up because he just messed up his promise to Richie (see last words, episode 5) by hooking up with Kevin. Richie's love is evident in the looks he gives Patrick in various episodes in both series. I see the sadness and disappointment but also the love. Especially evident in the dance scenes, which establish so much feeling.  It's a credit to both  to actors. Watch for the scapular scene in episode 6 ("" Pato. What you said last night about boyfriend. I'm in."") This  poignant scene highlights Richie's commitment to a serious relationship. It's important in season 2. Sadly, Richie comments ""Isn't that sweet."" Shows his lack of understanding the true meaning of the gesture. He'll figure it out later after many stupid mistakes. Watch the opening shot in season 1 finale, as Patrick walks down the street to the barbershop hesitates, looks in and opens the door. It too unifies the finale of season 2.  Watch for the word ""ready"" which occurs in several episodes. Season 1 finale and season 2 finale come full circle. A wonderful show, beautifully naturally acted, written and directed. Kudos to Andrew Haigh and Michael Lannon and to Tanya Saracho. Please push for a Season 3. There are so may stories unfinished and miles to go.",1428364800,2,2858,4.572265625

6242239,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"This is absolutely my favorite television series ever!  It is a beautifully shot, exquisitely acted look into the lives of 3 gay men living in San Francisco.  If you love movies that are character driven and really allow you to get to KNOW the characters and feel what they're feeling, this series is the best example I've seen on TV.  Comprised of everyday situations that we all can relate to, the drama and comedy comes from the place that it comes from in our real lives...our interactions with friends, family and love interests, our discomfort in certain situations, the small meaningful moments that we must share with our best friends.  The dialogue is humorous and often underplayed, being delivered the same way that we would really speak when conversing with our friends.  Jonathan Groff is outstanding as Patrick, who is probably THE most real and complex character I've seen on TV to date...and you find yourself instantly relating to Patrick and routing him on, flaws and all.  The rest of the cast is superb also, with a special shout out going to Raul Castillo, who brings such emotional integrity to the character of Richie, with eyes that deliver such impact.  The only thing that comes close to Looking Season 1 is Looking Season 2, which has just finished airing on HBO.  In the second season, the entire cast gets their chance to shine, and every single one of them brings it with everything that they have!  I have never seen a cast of any show go this far and deep to make their characters so real, and it is a joy to watch!  My hope is that we get many years of this exceptional, ground-breaking series!

6242257,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"I tried to read all the bad reviews for LOOKING here on Amazon.  The majority pinpoint the flawed character traits of the three main actors as boring, but their flaws make them interesting to me.  This is post 90's, post 2000's.  Gay life has been deflated into the depths of assimilation and when these three characters are LOOKING for the thing they need, the bad reviews here call them boring.  There are no more dire causes, equality for LGBT in 2015 is palpable and being achieved in bigger ways each month.  To me, these characters are LOOKING for something that will give them the smallest amount of fulfillment and they each LOOK in a different way.  Agustin, very flawed is so interesting.  Hes lost and in season two is emerging out of his self-centeredness.  His growth is amazing from the first season.  Patrick fixation on Kevin looks like a freight train heading for a cliff and Richie sees it.  Dom, with his addiction to sex, and obsession with age, still wants to make a mark in this world.

6242322,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"Looking is post oppression era gay theater. There is no downer drama around AIDS or personalities damaged beyond repair by homophobia. The characters are believable and well fleshed out considering the episodes are only about thirty minutes long (standard length for a TV sitcom). Cinematography, sound, and acting are all excellent, and having lived in The City for a number of years, it's fun to see my old stomping grounds displayed within the context of an overall bright feature. I hope Ra&uacute;l Castillo continues in season II, and not just because he's a major hottie. There's a possibility for some real depth in exploring the coming together of his character and Groff's, two men separated by race, economic class, and family, and opportunity, or are they? I also appreciate the inclusion of the character, Dom, the so-called older member of the trio, and his discovery of feelings for Lynn, an even older gentleman played by Scott Bakulla. At least for guys like me, who lived through Reagan and served in the pre-Don't Ask, Don't Tell military, Looking is something upbeat and fresh. I recommend it!",1422835200,2,1113,5.021621621621621

The main character grated on my nerves because he felt so immature and awkward and had horrible decision making qualities, but I still enjoyed Looking for its amazing cinematography, its realistic portrayal of gay men, and its location. I lived in San Francisco for 3 years, and this show brought back a lot of memories. I've been to pretty much all the locations, and it felt so nice to be back there. *Nostalgia!* Anyway, the main character actually grows and changes, which is pretty spectacular, and I can see why they chose his character that way to show how much he grows.

I might not recommend this show to everyone, but if you like realistic shows, and are interested in San Francisco and LGBT culture, I strongly recommend it. 5 stars. :)",1422403200,2,812,4.638888888888889

6242334,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"This is by far the best gay television ever produced, and far better than all but one or two gay movies. Its greatness is owed to only two of the many talented people involved, without whom it would be merely good: Andrew Haigh, the creative genius behind it, and Jonathan Groff, its spectacularly versatile, gifted and delightful star.

The episodes written and directed by Haigh are so perfect they make me want to sing (I can't sing); the episodes written and directed by others are all right, but more tedious than fascinating.

The very, very best episodes are the ones featuring Groff (Patrick) and Ral Castillo, who plays Patrick's boyfriend Richie. They're the sweetest, sexiest, and yet most thoroughly believable romantic scenes I've ever seen anywhere. No melodrama, lots and lots of truth and intelligence. An American never could have created such a program as Looking; very few from anywhere could have either, which is why I call Haigh a genius.

The first season follows an arc, but a quality arc, not a story arc. They get consistently better through Episode Five, then gradually fall off after that. But even at its worst, Looking is the very best there is.

Two of the lead actors (Groff and Murray Bartlett) are openly gay, which helps A LOT. Not only does it increase Looking's credibility, but it minimizes the number of stupid, insulting but evidently obligatory ""How was it kissing a man?"" interviews with straight actors.",1421366400,4,1446,4.913934426229508

The characters are self-absorbed, aimless 30-somethings looking for sex.  I thought it would be about men looking for and building relationships.  Maybe HBO should create an engaging series about gay men who live and work in middle America, because ""Looking"" reminded me of stereotypes of gay men in the Bay Area that I've heard for 30 years.

I've seen Jonathan on Broadway several times &(Spring Awakening) his talent needs to be seen on a stage . I guess getting a steady check is enough for some people.. This review has nothing to do with San Francisco, nothing to do with the Gay lifestyle which I'm retired from, nothing to do with the actors..

I loved Haigh's ""Weekend,"" which is a wonderful and very relatable film that portrayed gay men I actually recognized and related to, but his work on ""Looking"" falls short.  This show should really be called ""Failing,"" because it is so painful to watch the characters stumble through every aspect of life.  This show is not about college kids or twinks who you would expect to be flailing about in life, but compared to these guys, Hannah Horvath on ""Girls"" is a pillar of confident success.
A quick rundown of the characters without giving away anything crucial:
Groff is completely adorable as Patrick, but not exactly believable as a successful video game designer.  His inability to build something with Richie is drawn out and very frustrating.  Why would a guy want a cute, affectionate, honest, mature, sexy, romantic boyfriend who is great in bed when he can just pine after his unavailable boss and worry about what other people think of a mexican?  Seriously?  This is not even a spoiler because I was so confused about what was going on in Patrick's head I don't even remember how it turned out.
Dom is hot.  He hates turning 40.  If you are 40 and totally hot and seemingly everyone wants to sleep with you, seriously dude, get over it.  Life if good.  He complains about Grindr being awful for guys over 30, but he has constant sex with hot younger guys from...you guessed it!...Grindr.
Augustine is AGONY to watch.  Every scene he was in felt like utter torture.  If this pathetic and totally unlikable character is just the result of the writers, they have quite a job pulling Augustine out of a pit of viewer hatred next season.  Based on the poor writing in most of the series, if creating such an epic douchebag was their objective they really lucked out with that actor.
I really would not have been able to make it through the season without Richie and a wonderful supporting cast.  Scott Bakula is terrific as a normal, well-adjusted older gay man.  Yes!  They exist!  Thank you for showing us one on tv even if he isn't gay in real life.  Not all gay men are self-hating failures with unfulfilled lives!  Julia Duffy is perfect as Patrick's highly-strung mother.  The straight friends are also both believable and rescued many scenes from sheer boredom.
This show may be a TV first for showing gay men who are not total stereotypes, but it seems they set out to mostly portray gay men who are so very unsure of themselves to the point of wondering how we as viewers are supposed to like characters who don't seem to like themselves.  There are also some racial/class issues which seem rather ridiculous for relatively young San Franciscans.  The straight characters are all totally cool and accepting of everything, which is shocking considering that their gay friends are not.
I truly hope they can get it together in Season 2.  This show has the opportunity to fill a void for representations of gay people on television.  Is it too much to ask that they try harder?  Gay people who want to see people like them on TV will watch this show because it is a rare opportunity to do so.  It would be nice if I wanted to watch ""Looking"" because it is good, not because it is the only ""gay"" show on TV.",1409616000,16,3318,4.608177172061329
6242359,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"After ""Queer as Folk"" left the airwaves n 2005 I have been hoping that some network would bring back a weekly gay-themed drama. Well Showtime answered my wishes.  ""Looking tells the story of three best friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area and the search for a happy and fulfilling life.

 The series may not be as popular as ""Queer as Folk"", but with enough time ""Looking"" will find its audience. Near the end of the first season Nielsen numbers were getting up which is why HBO has already announced Season 2 will debut in the new year.

 The writing is excellent and the performances are flawless and the backdrop of San Francisco serves as both a beautiful backdrop and character in itself.",1408579200,5,701,4.620967741935484
6242360,4,B00HX3ZKS4,"What first surprised me about the show is its relative brevity - especially for a US TV series. It only consists of 8 half-hour episodes, which makes it more akin to a British television series. And I think this did the show a lot of good since it made sure that the writing was a lot more focused and thus the character plots also more at the forefront. And given the relative limited cast involved, it meant that most characters had their fair share of time in focus.

Patrick is a hard character to love. At times he's adorable and endearing. Other times, he's a little pathetic and tiring. But that all works for him and keeps him very human, and very real. And that sets the tone for most of the show - the simple elegance in its often austere and very true-to-life presentation of things. It's not flashy like QAF was. Instead it's a show that remains firmly rooted in reality, something significantly aided to make sure the time-place setting of contemporary San Francisco is pretty strong.

Patrick is obviously the story of focus, but that is not to say that the other threads weren't interesting. I think the story involving Dom was a pretty intriguing one as he tries to find a new path for himself and how tries to resolve his friendship with Lynn. But Agustin's story was pretty messed up and could have used a bit more on-screen development, I think. One could already see where the story was bound to go given the first episode along, but how we get from the beginning to the season ender could have been elaborated upon a bit more.

The inclusion of Russell Tovey as Kevin, Patrick's new boss, was naturally a major squee moment for my partner and myself. He's certainly one of the more interesting openly gay actors in the industry and his television work with shows like the original Being Human already had him blip on our radar. Plus he's pretty adorable in a dorky kind of way and the complexities of his character made for a nice enough mix. Yay for more Russell Tovey!

On the whole, I enjoyed Looking, but I know the show has a bit of a ways to go before it becomes truly significant versus other TV shows. There were a number of complaints about how the show may have traded old stereotypes for new ones, but seriously, what TV show is totally free of stereotypes? A lot of entertainment holds a mirror up to our lives and Looking didn't go too deeply some of the more classic stuff from LGBT shows like a strong AIDS-related sub-plot or a ridiculous amount of substance abuse on a regular basis as part of the circuit scene. This is not QAF - but I think it's addressing a new niche in terms of what LGBT stories can be told.

Looking is a show with a lot of potential and I do plan on sticking around until the second season to see how things go. Admittedly this means that I appreciate the show more for its potential than its actual merits at this point and hopefully this investment of trust will pay off.",1403740800,22,2935,4.437847866419295
6242361,5,B00HX3ZKS4,This series starts slow as they build up on the characters. But then it grows on you as you keep rooting for the 3 leads. It does not sensationalize and shows the everyday lives of men who happen to be gay. Good example of natural acting! Kudos to Jonathan Groff and other actors. And love that drunken kiss somewhere in ep. 7. Looking forward to Looking season 2.,1402963200,4,364,4.367647058823529
6242362,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"(FYI - I am a straight man) Looking was completely overshadowed by True Detective earlier this year with both of them being released around the same time, and I hope that it gains more popularity as the seasons go on. I fell in love with the characters and couldn't wait to see episode after episode. It is sweet, funny, and a really satisfying watch! Totally recommend it.",1400457600,10,373,4.582089552238806
6242363,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"This show is very good, I was hooked after the first episode. I look forward to when the DVD comes out, I will buy it for sure. I hope other people will give it a chance like I did.",1399680000,3,181,3.6666666666666665
6242364,3,B00HX3ZKS4,"I've lived in San Francisco for 40 years and waited for this series with great anticipation... watched each episode 2 x ..... just couldn't feel it.... casting was off, chemistry was off, sets okay
acting, especially those playing Kevin,Richie great.... characters seemed cursory, superficial and once again sex rules and there can be no happy endings for the gay boys....

The idea was great, written, scripted well but it didn't come across on film.... how about presenting some real life men who have sex with men in a real, yet life-affirming tale....",1398988800,5,555,5.032608695652174
6242365,2,B00HX3ZKS4,"On the last episode of the first season, one of the characters tells his boyfriend that what he does is mediocre at best. The same thing I can say about this show. I watched it with an open mind  but I couldn't get myself to actually warm up to it. I really thought that I was going to like it better as it progressed but came the final episode and I was uninterested as when I watched the beginning. One of the problems is that the characters are hardly bearable and possibly dislikeable and unengaging.  You have Patrick who is so naive you almost lose your patience at his ignorance towards sex and dating. You have 40 year old Dom who finds a ""sugar daddy"" that will help him open up his own restaurant because he knows how to make one chicken dish. He keeps him around for selfish reasons, not that he actually wants any romantic connection with this florist/investor, although Dom seems to give him hope. Dom likes to have sex with younger men. He only wants the older guy, Lynn, for his money. A pretty accurate and 'positive' portrayal of the gay community, right? Then you have the unemployed artist, Agustin, who lays around the house doing pretty much nothing; has a douchebag personality and looks unkempt. Richie breaks up with Patrick for stupid, childish reasons. It has to be mentioned that I've seen better acting in a beginning acting class. Here, the actors have awkward, unbelievable moments that make me cringe. If it wasn't for the fact Jonathan Groff did a good job on the show 'Glee,' I would have written him off as an actor.

  The life situations seen in ""Looking"" are predictable. Nothing we haven't seen before on another show. Nothing that anybody hasn't done yet. Others have and have done it better. Remember the WB? That network or production company that spewed out unsuccessful show after another? Well,  ""Looking"" is one of those shows that will  stay on the air and be renewed for another season because it's the only gay-themed show on a big network and it draws some viewership. Not that it is actually interesting. Some will disagree of course. Some will say it wasn't supposed to be ground-breaking. But at least it could have been interesting. The show felt like it was dragging its feet on the ground.  Sprinkling in some cultural diversity really didn't do much for the show either.  ""Looking"" tried to recapture the San Francisco that once was and yet the setting of the show is of a modern-time (Dom as a Castro clone? This isn't the 70's anymore). It just didn't work. Alas, the most cringe-worthy elements of the show is watching the actors eat. Patrick eats and talks at the same time on many of the scenes throughout the show. It's petty, I know, but you do have to see how the food looks in his and on his mouth as he chews. You will notice. He must have done this to appear as he is effortlessly acting. I have never seen a show/comedy-drama with so much messy eating you almost feel you need to wipe the characters' mouths. It's like watching a Guy Fieri show.  It didn't really give the show any sense of lifelike casualness it tried to achieve. The show wasn't a complete flop but very close.

  The only factors that earned the show something to remember it by is the soundtrack. Original underground gems from San Francisco's dance music golden era feature Paul Parker, Patrick Cowley, and Sylvester and some other hi-nrg stars are used sparsely and mostly (sadly)  in the ending credits. The San Francisco scenery is gorgeous as usual, but most if us know it isn't the gay mecca anymore. The show could've had its setting elsewhere and nobody would've noticed. Tales of The City, Noah's Ark, or Queer as Folk this show hardly competes with. We could've done without it even. Watch at your own risk.",1398297600,4,3756,4.6032934131736525
6242366,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"I watched this short series from the beginning and was hooked immediately.  Mostly by the reality of every word and every scene.  None of the guys and girls seemed like they were 'acting' but were real people filmed during real times in their lives especially Patrick (Jonathan Groff).  I knew someone exactly like him and I could almost guess what Patrick was going to say and do next.

Thank you HBO for having faith in this series and bringing it back.  Let's hope it goes on for many years, it deserves to, it's a real show about real people.",1397260800,5,546,4.474747474747475

Gay tv  series are very rare and this  is the  worst of them all..The acting is  good but  that is all. .The  hand held camera is extremely annoying and  it just never stops. It is like watching  the show during an earthquake. It is  appalling. Who was responsible for this monstrocity? The  lighting is even worse.
,much worse A very tedious affair and none of the  characters are interesting or their  situations. Finally,why do  most of the  leading  male characters  wear beards (mostly  untidy ones  )? I  got sick of seeing all those hairy faces!",1396915200,14,615,4.613207547169812

My only real complaint is that the episodes are too short, as soon as you get into it the end credits roll. I like that it's shot on location in SF. I loved Queer as Folk but in that world you have to be and stay young and gorgeous and we will all age (if we're lucky). I don't have HBO so I will have to wait until Netflix carries it on BluRay then I'll rent the whole Season. It's really not fair to compare it to Queer as Folk because they come from different cable channels and different writers but they both portray gay men. I like what I've seen so far. I am curious what the next 6 episodes will bring.",1396828800,3,730,3.9727891156462585

6242372,5,B00HX3ZKS4,"When I heard about ""Looking"" I wasn't excited at all. It sounded like a bad copy of ""Queer as Folk"" but I decided to give it a chance anyway. And I'm glad I did! ""Looking"" follows the lives of three gay friends in San Francisco, but what makes this show so unique is that they don't have to try too hard, I even forgot at times that it was a ""gay show"" because you find a little bit of yourself in every character, and you get to love them by the second or third episode and you get addicted instantly, that's how I know a show is good! The cast works really great together, the series doesn't follow the typical stereotypes, they are just guys with issues that anyone would have, which I find very refreshing, and lately, media is all about gay teens, but what about gay adults?
The shoots from locations of San Francisco are just beautiful, and the writing is superb, but I'm sad that the season only has 8 episodes because I want more! At least it was renewed for a second season earlier this week, and hopefully season 2 will have 10 or 13 episodes.
This show may not be for everyone, some scenes are explicit (not graphic, but you quickly understand what's going on without seeing anything graphical), and it gets a little clich sometimes, but it's a good show overall. Every episode is a great episode.
It's really worth the pre-order and I can't wait to see the last two episodes! (by the time i'm writing this, only 6 of the 8 episodes have aired so far). Start watching if you haven't seen it!",1393632000,41,1502,4.3487544483985765
