4862402,4,B005S9EL3K,"_I admit that when I first bought this collection I thought that I had been ripped off. That is also what the casual Three Stooges fan is probably going to think too. However, I changed my mind after the third time I watched it through. It really isn't that bad. In fact, it is a pretty good historical overview of Stooge material.

_The Funniest Moments half of the program is probably misnamed. These are not the funniest moments of the Columbia shorts. What these are is the complete set of live-action ""wrap-arounds"" for the animated Stooges cartoons from 1965. These are really under-rated. They show that the team lost none of their timing in their twilight years. It was one last chance to showcase their perfectly polished and timed routines. These all feature ""Curly-Joe"" DeRita. Personally I liked DeRita. He was a good and genuinely funny man that fit in well with Moe and Larry. He had a gentleness that fit the mellowing of the act.

_The Festival half is more varied in content and quality. First it has two movie trailers- a ""Stoogeploitation"" cheapy from 1959, and a Ted Healy relic (Curly's first film appearance.) Then you get all of the Columbia short, ""Disorder in the Court."" This is followed by old television kinescopes: an excellent appearence as CBS executives on the Ed Wynn show (with Shemp), A surprisingly good guest shot with Frank Sinatra, the failed pilot for their first television show (the first time that their timing seems off), a painful talk show appearence by Moe (I see now that Moe's timing and delivery were good- it was the hacks around him whose timing and ad-libs were terrible), and a U.S. Savings Bond commercial from 1969 (one of their last appearances.) Oh yes, there is also a ""wraparound"" that wasn't included on ""Funniest Moments"" only this time it includes the animated cartoon (the animation quality wasn't great, but it was about average for the time.)

If you ever find me not laughing at the Stooges, then bury me- cause I must be dead.",1140652800,,1994,4.757225433526012

I have never ordered a digital movie, the only thing digital I have ordered has been FREE kid games for my grandchildren to play while they are visiting.

4862408,1,B005S9EL3K,"Three minutes in is enough to realize that this movie is lower than low brow.

Sadly, I started this movie without knowing anything and thought it would be a bio-pic. The Stooges have a great and interesting history. So maybe the first problem was mine alone. But it didn't make the movie any better once I realized what it really was.

The Three Stooges were a product of their times, a result of the humor from that time, including burlesque and movies. Those who love the Stooges most grew up in that more innocent period. When I grew up, the Stooges were relegated to UHF stations as after school viewing for  7-13 year old boys. They were more of a stepping stone in humor development. But today, their features and shorts don't even enjoy that audience.

The actors did a reasonable imitation of the Stooges, but that doesn't make the end result anything except a curiosity. There is a plot but it's weak and it doesn't really matter. There are a couple of funny bots but that doesn;t make a good movie.

Maybe the movie makers should have followed part of the Stooges career and made this a ten minute short.

I'd recommend that you skip it entirely.",1516492800,,1157,4.538461538461538

This film is a laugh riot and will have you rolling on the floor in laughter, just look out for your cup of Coca-cola and large popcorn because this movie made me belligerent and unaware of my surroundings I was laughing so hard. As a Stooge head I have waited long enough for another installment of the franchise, and let me tell you the shenanigans Larry, Curly, and Moe get up to in this film are some of the best Stooge gags I have ever seen. My favorite part is when Larry pokes Moe in the eyes but Moe puts his hand on his nose but Larry realizes this so he takes both his hands and pokes Moe's eyes with his index instead. I am howling just thinking about this scene. Overall I would give it a 10/10 for being a riot of laughs and fun for the whole family.

4862434,4,B005S9EL3K,"Though short on storyline, I think this is a pretty good casting. The 3 main stars accurately portray the characters of Moe, Larry, and Curly. I liked that the chapters are split up into episodes with the 3 Stooges movies. The story adequately explains why the stooges are a bit naive in the real world. (Though not why their spelling is so poor.) There was a genuine plot twist with Timmy's family. At times there can be some saccharine sentimentality, and some of the Nun jokes are a bit silly (why is one Nun obviously a man? Why would they have a Nun in a bikini as a lifeguard, especially when there seems to be non-Nuns working at the pool?) I especially appreciated the segment at the end explaining that the props were made of rubber and not real, and showing the eye-poke for the kids to see no one was really poked in the eye.",1496016000,,836,4.365384615384615

My wife and I laughed so hard we were gasping for breath in some scenes.  Note, however, you must be familiar with the original stooges to appreciated how well this movie was done.  It is an ""all's well that end's well"" somewhat politically correct movie though.  The Three Stooges were never shackled by political correctness in their day.  Everyone was a victim of their lunacy.  The taint of political correctness and the use of the rare ""risky"" joke are my only displeasure with this rendition. The Stooges NEVER used cheap suggestive jokes!!!  If you can overlook that you will laugh your head off.",1494374400,,763,4.641791044776119

4862437,4,B005S9EL3K,"This 2012 film is an attempt to introduce those who haven't seen the classical three stooges films to what was in it. It achieves its goal. It contains a no-letup series of silliness (humor?). People who saw some of the classical films will enjoy this remake with actors playing the original stooges.
In this film, the three are left on the doorstep of an orphanage as babies and are raised in the orphanage. They cause the orphanage many problems, leading many of the sisters trying to find a way to get rid of them, but fail to do so.
Years pass and they are still, as adults in the orphanage, still constantly hitting each other and still hitting others. A priest comes and tells the orphanage that it must close unless it can raise $830,000. The stooges leave the orphanage trying in various silly ways to raise the money.
They are approached by a woman who is in love with a man and the two want to find some way to get rid of the woman's husband. Not really understanding what they are going to do, the stooges agree to do so. This leads to all kinds of silly episodes. They meet a young man who had been in the orphanage and he turns out to be the husband who they were supposed to kill. This is just the beginning of much silliness and, as stated, people who enjoyed the classical three stooges will enjoy this film.",1493078400,,1324,4.364372469635628

4862444,5,B005S9EL3K,"....but so hilarious you find yourself guffawing? Absolutely!! I didn't care if this movie looked totally stupid, that's what makes the Stooges funny as hell! The stupider, the better, lol! :D The story was kinda depressing and completely not believable. But really, I'll bet that's not the big reason why this film was made, nor is it the reason people watch. They wanna see Stooge RIDICULOUSNESS, and these dudes DELIVER!! They speak like the Stooges, are dim witted like the Stooges, and get into all kinds of shenanigans like them. Each guy did a fabulous job making the character come to life. It must be hard to do, cz we all know how the characters are supposed to sound and behave. Moe was the same bossy, lovable bully, Larry was the same calmer, goofy ""straight man"" (not really, but the straightest straight man of the three), and Curly was genius, just as Jerome Howard was. All of them did a fabulous job, and it couldn't have been easy to fill these shoes, but they did.

As a kid, I loved the Stooges. When I got older, I didn't like them anymore because they were embarrassing to watch. So cornball, so cheesy, so slapstick stupid, so uncool, like an old man trying to rap. Now that I'm much older, I don't care about ""cool."" I watch them with abandon because they were FUNNY!!

I wish this movie got better reviews at the box office, cz these guys did a fabulous job! No one can ever perfectly replicate Howard, Fine, and Howard, but these guys come really, really close. Bravo!!",1485907200,,1496,4.5783582089552235

4862562,5,B005S9EL3K,"I happened upon this by chance - surfing through the channels, and stopped on this, just to see what the ""new"" Three Stooges looked like.
Of course, I knew that they weren't new at all - they've been around for several years - but I hadn't seen them before, so they were new to me.
They aren't actually clones of the original Three Stooges, but they are very close - and I can't remember ever seeing any other act which mimicked almost exactly, a different act; Elvis impersonators notwithstanding.
Well, within seconds, I laughed out loud - with the emphasis on ""loud,"" and that was followed almost immediately with another of the same, and then yet another.
It's been awhile since I've laughed as hard as the first laugh, not to even mention the second and third, and I immediately tore myself away from the TV to come to the computer to order my copy.
I had not seen the whole film through to the end, but it's really not necessary:  When you see the obvious chemistry of the characters being so believable in their roles, you just know that, barring some catastrophe, the rest of the film will be at least as funny - or maybe even moreso.

4862664,4,B005S9EL3K,"it's often said that comedy is for and/or about the underdog, and dogs don't get much farther under than Larry, Curly, and Moe. they fine-tuned if not invented what just might be comedy's most enduring (and endearing) archetype: the frantic muddler(s)-through who, despite wreaking havoc with their all too noticeable intellectual shortcomings, are basically decent sorts at heart and trying to do the right thing. as the classic comedy teams go, they may not quite measure up to The Marx Brothers or Abbott & Costello, but they can hold their own against, say, Laurel & Hardy.
i must say i had my doubts, even fears, about this film because it's by The Farrelly Brothers (Shallow Hal, There's Something About Mary). the Brothers and the Stooges certainly converge in sharing a lowbrow approach to comedy, but the Brothers' sophomoric, gross-out sensibility has frankly never been my cup of tea. it wasn't until it came to my attention that - this has GOT to be a first for the Farrellys - the film was rated PG that i decided maybe it would be a fitting tribute after all. while they didn't manage to rein their taste for scatology in completely (take the duel in the hospital maternity ward), the film does a fine job of recreating the world of the world's champion nitwits. it's three stars more than amply replicate not only the performance style but the timing and choreography of his respective Stooge. one shudders to think what they had to go through to get that down.
certain types continue to criticize, even look down on, The Three Stooges for the element of violence, but i'm not convinced they necessarily glorified violence. they never presented it as fun & games, but always as an impulsive, not thought through reaction to frustration. and they yelped in too much pain to be accused of trying to deny that violence can hurt. the fantasy element is the fact that it never lasts. what should be quite debilitating injuries always turn out to be minor, momentary inconveniences, like a mosquito bite or a losing lottery ticket. haven't we all had moments where such a realm would be appealing?
there's also no small heart to the film. (interestingly, despite the stereotype that women hate the Stooges, both of the raves featured on the box are from female reviewers.) to be fair, this in an element also present in the Farrellys' other work, but i usually find it a little contrived amidst the lowest-common-denominator laughs they go for. here, they manage to prove that a film can be touching without forfeiting the comedy. although it could have something to do with their using a formula that was perfected before they were even born.
some might even say it had too much heart. in it's most daring deviation from the formula, Moe finally goes too far and his colleagues decide to secede. the inevitable crises of conscience and loyalty couldn't help but invoke the sentimental. how does the film get around the potential schmaltz? how else? by pushing said schmaltz to the nth degree until it embraces and flaunts it's own ludicrousness. indeed, the film's happy ending is too ecstatically uplifting NOT to of been intended as a punchline.
the only real updates are a few pop-culture references, most obviously where Moe ends up on Jersey Shore. admit it: you'd like to poke Snooki in the eyeballs yourself.
our headliners don't really do much more than emulate the originals, but they do so with admiration and respect, clearly sharing the rest of the world's enthusiasm for all things Stooge. one Chris Diamontopoulos zeroes in on hapless would-be leader Moe, effortlessly (or so it would seem) bringing humanity without softening his edge. Will Sasso is perhaps a little too tall, but otherwise he's Curlier than Curly. and in an interesting twist of Fate, the closest thing to a star in the trio, Sean Hayes, takes the role of the least ""star"" Stooge, Larry.
that erstwhile no. 3 doesn't always get the credit he deserves, and it's sadly easy to see why. there are times when i think Larry is my least favorite Stooge and have to remind myself that it's a lack of focus rather than talent that hampers him. (besides, needless to say, any true Stoogephile's least favorite is always (drumroll) Joe Besser.) he was a fine comedian and certainly an asset to the act, but where exactly he fits into the grand scheme, what exactly he was necessary for, is hard to say. the team's style is basically that of the more conventional double-act comedy team, with Moe as Abbott and/or Hardy and Curly as Laurel and/or Costello. Larry serves as sort of an auxiliary backup Laurel/Costello. he's generally termed the ""middleman,"" possibly because it sounds better than ""functionally redundant hanger-on.""
but fortunately for Larry and his fans, this is comedy. unlike drama, which is so rigidly narrative driven than any character who doesn't contribute to said narrative is just in the way, comedy can occasionally accommodate a technically needless character, provided he's sufficiently amusing.
if there's a bone to be picked, it's the question just how necessary the film was. after all, the devotees already had the originals. to say nothing of the fact that remakes are the type of film least likely to prove worth the trouble. (for every Peter Jackson version of King Kong or Steve Martin versions of Father Of The Bride, there's gotta be at least a couple dozen Adam Sandler versions of Mr. Deeds or Keanu Reeves versions of The Day The Earth Stood Still.)
well, maybe there wasn't any crying need for the film, but at least it can be said that, as long as they were gonna do, at least they did it right. what some might dismiss as a rehash could equally be considered a love-letter. this is a film by and starring fans of The Three Stooges, so they knew what it had to be and how to render it so. that, as far as i'm concerned, is more than sufficient justification. soitenly!!
this film won't exactly makes anyone abandon Howard, Fine, & Howard for Diamontopoulos, Hayes, & Sasso, but it should certainly amuse and delight those devotees. they are after all the target audience.",1439596800,3,6097,4.818702290076335
4862665,4,B005S9EL3K,"Fun, entertaining, slightly campy. Impressions of the originals were dead-on!",1439337600,,77,6.8
4862666,5,B005S9EL3K,"The Three Stooges (the original show) is, without a doubt, an absolute timeless classic.  They were unique, and spawned many imitators and trends.  While a cynic might say that their show lacked variation, I'd say quite the opposite.  The characters used their innocent personalities and absolute mastery in physical comedy to do interesting commentary on world issues, and while they specialized in slapstick not only they were the kings of it, they used it as a vehicle to tell some stories that stand the test of time.

While due to several circumstances the third Stooge was changed several times, leaving only Larry and Moe constant, the most popular iteration of the group is the one with Curly as the third guy (followed by Shemp), and this is the one presented in this film by the Farrelly Brothers, clearly big fans of the show.  And despite its lukewarm reception, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.  I honestly regret not having seen it in theaters.  This has to be evidence of how a bad trailer can be negative for a film's reception, since the problem is clearly not the film's quality, but the trailers where more than a bit underwhelming.  I suppose they wanted to leave all the funnier bits hidden, but this didn't work well for the movie's box office (though, apparently, a sequel is in the works with the same cast, so we might be lucky).

But I digress, the movie has a story, and it's a very generic/derivative one.  The Stooges have to raise money to save an orphanage, and they end up getting tied into a woman's (Sofia Vergara) attempt to assassinate her husband to acquire his fortune.  But here's the thing: the story is not important, and the directors know it.  They deliberately picked a familiar story because they knew it was just a means to an end, which was to show the Stooges in action.  And they succeeded inmensely.  The film is funny through and through.  It's not just about the pratfalls, of course, but there's no part of the film that unnecessarily slogs for drama.  This is a very well-crafted comedy, and it's enjoyable in its entirety.

The movie starts with the Stooges in their childhood, where they live through their adulthood until they're forced to leave because the place is about to close.  I must point out this is a brilliant excuse to showcase the Stooges' innocence.  They live completely disconnected from the outside world, so when they arrive in the city, they behave just like the original Stooges would.  It's the best way to portray them as they used to be without resorting to time travel.  Once in the city, they proceed to get into shenanigans that get them and almost everyone they cross paths with in trouble and lots of fantastic slapstick.

The obvious best part of the movie is the three main actors.  Sean Hayes (Larry), Will Sasso (Curly) and Chris Diamantopoulos (Moe) are absolutely brilliant as the Three Stooges.  They nail, NAIL the original actors looks, mannerisms and slapstick abilities.  They do it so well you'd swear they're the original actors reincarnated.  At the start of the movie, the characters are represented by child actors, and they do and incredibly good job of it too.  Obviously, the directors did a great job in finding and directing the cast in order to offer a proper tribute to the original series, and they did it so well that if you watch this movie in a monochrome screen you'd swear it was a restored old episode. The film is presented as three interconected episodes with classic title cards, which is an appropiate treat.

I haven't watched the extras yet (I soon will), but the quality of the video and audio is impressive in the Blu Ray.  The only bad thing I can say about it right now is that it doesn't allow you to go to the main menu right away when you put the disc, you have to skip all the previews one by one.  I never understood that annoying design choice, but it's there.  Still, if you get a chance to watch this movie, do it.  It's worth your time.",1438905600,3,3986,4.625889046941679

4862748,4,B005S9EL3K,"The Three Stooges
 Remember the Three Stooges from the olden days?  Remember how silly they were but how you laughed anyway?  Well, the new, un-improved, un-changed 2012 version of the manic trio is just like the original.  If you laughed at the old timey stooges, you will enjoy the new timey stooges just as much.  If you are a girl, you might not get the humor.  If you are a guy and are older than seven, you will only enjoy it if you remember the bygone days of your child hood.  I, and most of the audience with me, laughed like we hadnt done since grade school.  It was a hoot.
 Comedy is meant to make us laugh, often to laugh at ourselves.  It can be wry, some people find it vastly amusing when David Niven lifts his eyebrow at exactly the right moment.  This is how sophisticates get their jollies.  It is quiet, refined and speaks to the well educated mind.  This is nothing like The Three Stooges.  This form of humor is ancient, literally ancient.  In Rome players would entertain the commonality with broad humor, physical jokes and slap stick.  In fact the slap stick was used in Rome.  A slap stick is a paddle shaped double-board with a hinge on it so that when another player is struck an extra loud noise is created.  Actual slap sticks are still sometimes seen at places like Circuses where live action humor is still practiced.  It is old, it is crude and it is still very funny if done by experts.  The Three Stooges replace the slap stick with loud, over the top sound special effects.  When they smack a Catholic nun with a hammer, the nuns head rings like a fire gong.  Did I say I laughed and laughed?
 The Farrelly Brothers wrote, directed and produced this homage to vaudeville.  The brothers are known for their low brow, often gross, brand of humor.  They are responsible for such hits as Dumb and Dumber, There is Something About Mary, and Shallow Hal.  They spent an ambitious $30 million to make the film.  The three day opening weekend brought in only $17 million but perhaps word of laugh will get around and more people will come to see it.
 Our hats are off to stars Sean Hayes, Chris Diamantopoulos and Will Susso.  In physical humor, timing is everything and these guys pull it off flawlessly.  Some of the routines are very complicated and lengthily.  Think of extended fight scenes in a Bruce Lee kung-fu movie, only with physical comedy gags and you have the idea.
 This PG rated-no bad words, no naked movie stars- one hour and 32 minute comedy rates a strong three and a half saw blades for laugh out loud humor.  If silly (stupid?) physical humor is your thing, or if you want to see three idiots trying to get a laugh out of the crowd, give this one a try.  Laugh wrinkles are much to be preferred to the other kind.",1428451200,2,2763,4.416666666666667

4862988,4,B005S9EL3K,"This film is every much the knucklehead comedy that the original Three Stooges short films were. The story is divided into ""episodes,"" to create the feel of the original Stooges' short films and follows them from infancy through childhood to nominal adulthood. They are sent out into the world by the Mother Superior to try and save the orphanage they grew up in from foreclosure. They cause mayhem in a big city hospital, get into intrigue with a femme fatale and her lover, and wind up with the cast of Jersey Shore.

This is all familiar territory for those of us who grew up watching the Three Stooges -- as it breaks no new ground -- replete with corny humor, slapstick comedy, and physical comedy. The actors Will Sasso, Sean Hayes, and Chris Diamantopoulos made no attempt to bring anything new to their roles, but rather, were content to do 90 minutes of impressions of the original Larry, Moe and Curly.

4862995,5,B005S9EL3K,"High Noon, 1952 film

The film begins with a man sitting and waiting. Another comes to join him. Then a third man, and they ride into town. People notice them. Pierce, Miller, and Colby ask about the train schedule. Will Kane and Amy Fowler wed. Kane is the Town Marshal, but intends to quit. A telegram brings news of Frank Miller's pardon! [Some kind of payoff in those days?] Kane is advised to leave town. [Can every problem be avoided as a solution?] No, Kane decides to return; he doesn't even have a gun! [Unbelievable.] Kane could never be safe as long as those four were after him. ""I'm not trying to be a hero."" With special deputies he will outnumber them. Amy asks him to choose between her whims and his experience and judgment. The judge decides to skip town. Deputy Harvey goes to see Marshal Kane, he wants the job and a recommendation.

We learn about the past relationships of Harvey, Kane, and Frank Miller! Mrs. Ramirez wants to sell her store quickly so she can leave on the noon train. Will the hotel be more prosperous when Frank Miller is back? Harvey is in the saloon. Ben Miller drops in for a bottle. Kane asks for help in the saloon, none volunteer. [Why?] Neither does a friend. Jimmy asks to join, he used to be good with a gun. Kane goes to the church to ask for all the special deputies he can get to help him. The church members argue over what must be done. Time is running short. Can a problem be solved by ""deferred maintenance""? ""They just don't care."" [Why?] Mark says he is too old. Mrs. Kane visits Mrs. Ramirez for help, but she is leaving too. Amy's personal experiences are explained. [A clue to the future?] ""A smart man knows when to back away."" Harvey talks to Kane. [Does this fight make sense? Note the bruises.] One man had volunteered, but Herb doesn't like the odds. The clock strikes noon. The steam train whistles its approach. Kane writes a holographic Last Will and Testament.

Marshal Kane walks into Main Street and watches the wagon leave for the train station. Frank Miller detrains and joins those three men. Breaking glass warns Kane. Shots are fired, not it is three against one. The hunting goes on, one man runs into the barn. Now it is two against one. The stable is set afire. Kane frees the horses and escapes. One man is shot from behind! [I won't tell who did it.] Only Frank Miller is left. Then Kane appears in the street. It is over at last. Will and Amy are reunited. Will tosses his tin star into the dust.

""The Making of High Noon"" follows. Monochrome is used to reduce costs, as in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", when an unconventional movie is produced. This story is based on ""The Tin Star"", a 1947 story in Collier's Magazine. Carl Foreman was an ""unfriendly witness"" before HUAC, a man who stood for what he believed in. The script was an excellent drama. The low budget excluded the usual padding. Western movies show the pioneers who overcame adversity; this provides hope for the common people.

The story takes place in virtually real time. This is a morality play where a good man triumphs over villains. It doesn't give the background from five years ago when Frank Miller was convicted of manslaughter. Was he involved in the running of that ""hotel"" and a gambling casino? Did Will Kane move in to take over? In the 19th century the local Committee of Vigilance would have eliminated robbers and murderers. A Town Marshal was elected by the voters, but the local power elite would have selected a man to do their bidding. A Marshal who best represented the people would have no problem in getting special deputies. This story goes against these historical facts. Having a woman with a firearm is also unconventional, but few dared to comment on this. This one-man army is similar to the later ""Rambo"" movies.",1412640000,,3787,4.571428571428571
4862996,4,B005S9EL3K,"Don't let people convince you not to see this. Sure, it is not the original Three Stooges, and that is what turns most people off. It is though absolutely hillarious, and for the most part stays very true to the spirit of the originals.

I still get a laugh from the absurdity of the original TS films, and based on the trailers, I imagined the director and writer(s) had captured the essence, but there were only a few moments that gave me a chuckle, such as when the church bell clonged off the malicious nun's head, or the boys gleefully rip out tufts of armpit hair from one of their hapless victims, or when Curly's pet rat gets flung into Sofia Vergara's daunting cleavage (hey, it's burlesque). Most of the film however was awkward and dull, with lifeless writing and acting that rarely cut the mustard. The original threesome, in their prime, had a physical presence, chemistry, and energy that's never been duplicated, and there's no way to avoid comparing originals to their latter day namesakes. Bottom line: This film has a few moments of good slapstick, and little kids might enjoy it if they're young enough, but it failed to capture the essential maniacal, absurd, violent schadenfreude that define the Three Stooges, and I found myself getting impatient for it to end.",1404518400,,1083,4.827956989247312

3.  A really lame plot premise that tries to include ""hip"" urban contemporary elements that are intolerable.
4.  Comedy attempts about committing murder, babies peeing in faces, sadistic nuns, lion testicles, and torturing dolphins
5. The ridiculous message from the Farrely brothers at the end of the movie.  What was with the one a-hole without a shirt and flexing his pecs???",1395014400,5,639,5.145631067961165
4863150,5,B005S9EL3K,"On the face of it, making a film about the Three Stooges is not really the greatest of ideas, however the Farrelly brothers have pulled it off. The off-the-wall humor, and especially the physicality of the humor is successfully captured due to a collaboration of the directors, the actors, the stunt guys, and very importantly the sound guys. In some respects the story is not totally new or original, but the chance to execute the physical gags in the original shorts was obviously too much to pass up. This is clearly
not a movie for everyone. However, in the theatrical showing I went to, the audience clearly enjoyed what has been produced. So, from my point of view the movie is fully successful at re-creating one of the greatest, if not the greatest comedy team. If you are really into the stooges and want to see what is basically the complete collection as we have it, the ultimate collection 20 disc set from Columbia Pictures is not to be missed. Having watched that, I did get the feeling that a lot of the detailed stunts that
this film steals from the stooges is taken very likely from the 1935 to 1936 period in the disc set.
  The extras on Blu-ray are very raucous. The history of the Three Stooges is essential, although if you have the 20 disc set you will know a lot of the material. The deleted scenes leaves out a lot, and I do mean a lot of really good content. Casting the Three Stooges is kind of so-so but still lots of fun. The feature behind-the-scenes of the Three Stooges is a blast as well and you can see just how much they owe to the original stooges in sound effects with the feature on the Three Stooges sound effects. The
Three Stooges mashup was fun, but ultimately something I could've done without. It would've been very nice to have a commentary but as it is the combo is great buy, even though the live extras had nothing on it (not even an announcement to say anything about when something might've happened).",1394841600,2,1951,4.477528089887641

Physically, the actors bear a striking resemblance to the originals.  But it's their spot-on mannerisms and vocal inflections that really channel the spirit of those chowderheads into the movie.  Who'd have thought Sean Hayes as Larry would be a good match?  But he does an awesome job having fun with the role.
The plot about saving an orphanage...who cares?  It's little more than a backdrop to send the morons into the modern world where they can wreak havoc with the normal people.  And they do!!!!  The Farrellys have captured the essence of the Stooges by sometimes recreating the same shtick the classic Stooges had, and at other times projecting those characteristics into new situations (such as I-phones and the Jersey Shore).  And as if seeing the Stooges wasn't enough, the movie also features Sofia Vergara, and a group of nuns that include Jennifer Hudson, Jane Lynch, Kate Upton, and Larry David.

4863193,5,B005S9EL3K,"I'm not sure why IMDb voters only rate FOX's THE THREE STOOGES (2012) at 5.1.

Of utmost importance is that the picture's two plots are irrelevant to the main event: three actors who through skillful slapstick (and spot-on sound effects) bring back to life our old favorites, Moe, Larry and Curly. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is this modern Larry Fine doesn't get the funniest lines as the original did (""Look! An inkwell!"").

It's incredible how skilled these guys are and how much they resemble the Stooges. Their synchronicity in timing slaps, eyepokes and shovels to the sconce is impeccable and when they get going all out they're as funny as Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard ever were. It's a movie that's perfect for home viewing, BTW. I laughed throughout!

My favorite sight gag (of about 50) is the boys accidentally unloosing a large brass bell from its tower. The bell slides down an inclined roof and hits on the top of the dome the nosy nun (played by Larry David in drag) that's been hounding our knuckleheads since the film's beginning. Naturally, there's a loud BONG! when it happens. The Stooges peer over the roof's edge and see the unconscious nun spreadeagled on the lawn. A classic ""Nyaaah!"" reaction shot.

Moe says, ""Uh-oh, is that Sister Mary-Mengele?"" and Curly shoots back in his inimitable falsetto, ""I dunno, but the face rings a bell!""

You've gotta love stuff like that.

This Farrelly brothers farce is divided into three ""shorts"" but it's all one story. Each opens with recreations of one of the several beloved ""Stooge"" themes. Before we reach the finale (then the Farrellys warning little kids not to hit anyone with a hammer or poke an eye), we see a peeing newborn fight in a maternity ward, the boys plummeting from a multi-storey building, a little girl suspended in air by party balloons who lands butt-first in a gorgeous cake, also the usual crab latched onto a nose, Curly destroying a chainsaw's teeth with his iron forehead, Moe ripping out Larry's hair, Curly running in a circle while laying on his side and all the other zaniness we expect from these chowderheads.

But there's a bonus for all fans (and haters) of a certain reality TV show set on the coast of a herein unnamed Mid-Atlantic State (don't miss this part-- it's hilarious!).

If you're in the mood for some real ""nyuks,"" rent or buy THE THREE STOOGES - The Movie. You'll love it!",1388620800,2,2411,4.723809523809524
4863194,2,B005S9EL3K,"I have seen all of the original Three Stooges shirts,as well as all of the movies they did up through the early 1960s.
While the main cast tries very hard, perhaps too hard, they never quite manage to successfully pull off ""Stooge-ing"".
Sean Hayes is particularly annoying as Larry.

The main problem is with the tone of the script. There is a certain mean spiritedness which was never a part of the Three Stooges.  They would good naturedly poke fun at anything, or at anyone, but  they were never mean spirited about their antics.

The movie has a certain harsh ""edge"" which made me very uncomfortable.  The original Stooges came from the Yiddish comedy tradition. The entire plot of this movie centers around a catholic orphanage.  I am not from a Catholic background,  but even I was very uncomfortable with the ongoing snipes at Catholic things - particularly Nuns.  Nun jokes are just not funny.

The actors of Moe Larry and curly were extremely accurate in their portrayal, but adding Jersey shore was indeed stupid. I've never watched the show but it looks stupid and I've never seen bigger losers than those freaks. I saw a youtube video with this trailer in it. The guy( Hitler,made fun of multiple times in the original) was flipping out about adding Jersey shore to this film, the video was quite enjoyable. But back to the point, I honestly think they should have put the setting like in the original series, WW2 terra, if they'd done this, in my opinion, they would have had a lot more options and setting choices. I've seen this movie with one of my friends, and It was ok, but the whole story kinda drifted and just randomly did stuff. Such as when that one guy is trying to shoot Larry and Curly, Why didn't he just go through the front, I mean come on, do you really think they have metal detectors or something, and I have to agree with some people when they do the whole don't do this and crap, I mean we went with my 8 year old brother and even without the warning, he probably never would have done that.

As was true for their shorts, the flimsy story was purely a vehicle to allow the stooges to do their schtick. If you don't like the original three stooges shorts, you won't like this film. That's probably why most critics gave it so-so reviews. However, if you appreciate their timing and sense of sarcasm and slapstick, you'll appreciate what these actors did to create an honorable tribute to the stooges with a lot of original references, but also updates for modern times. This hour-and-a-half-long romp is even divided into 3 segments that closely resemble the feel of the shorts. Even the child ""Moe"" is really true to the part. I wasn't sure if the Farrelly brothers would make this a raunchy movie. They didn't. I can't think of a single cuss word. The slapstick is exactly what it was in the past, so the ""violence"" is very cartoonish. The only things I can think of that wouldn't have been allowed in the 40's is a single fart joke and a very hilarious but tasteful scene of squeezing babies to make them pee on the other stooges. ""Oh, a pee shooter, huh?"" I really had a good laugh with that scene.
As for the other characters, I didn't care as much for the drag nun. He just wasn't funny to me. The nun in a bikini at the end was also a bit awkward. Other than that, good job to all involved. If you just want to laugh and like the originals, you'll like this.",1376352000,,1460,4.451492537313433

It's actually a very funny movie that our whole family enjoyed, especially as it was ""PG"" and so was pretty clean.  I was surprised as how closely the actors were able to mimic the original Stooges' voices.  I was also surprised to see Kirby Heyborne (of ""The RM"") in this movie and he did a decent job.

To give a brief synopsis, the Stooges are left at an orphanage.  After 35 years or so, the orphanage is going to close so Larry, Curly, and Moe set off for the city to raise the loads of money necessary to save their orphanage home.  I won't give any more away, as I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet.  Let me just say that seeing Larry David as a nun is worth watching.  I especially got a kick out of ""her"" name--Sister Mary-Mengele.  My husband didn't get the joke at all, but I believe it's a reference to Joseph Mengele, the ""Angel of Death"" butcher of Auschwitz.  I know it doesn't sound like it should/would be a joke, but it was just poking fun at the stereotype of the mean, ugly nun.

They set out to replicate as much as possible the work and spirit of one of the most important comedy teams in cinema. As a huge, long-time Stooges fan I feel highly qualified to cast a highly critical eye on anything involving them. This effort basically works. It is of course impossible to perfectly reproduce and carry on the tradition of these timeless and incomparable performers, but this movie does it about as well as would be possible. The makers' appreciation and understanding of the essence of Stoogery comes through in this movie. If anything, the biggest deviation from the spirit of the originals is that it is more ""high rent"" than the originals. Those who are knowledgeable about the work of the original Three Stooges know that their movies were very ""low budget"".

4863310,5,B005S9EL3K,"Anyone doing the Stooges has a hard road ahead of them.  No matter what they do they will not be THE Three Stooges and it will show in some way.  But once you accept it, this movie is worth discussion.  Though I refer to this movie in some places as an ""average comedy"", I do not mean this as a negative commentary on any of the actors or the three guys doing the stooges.  They were good.

First the movie is way flawed.  The basic premise is wrong.  ""SPOILER""  In this movie the Stooges decide they need to commit Murder. ??? What???  You can use all the plot tricks you want but there is JUST NO WAY the Stooges would ever make up their minds that it was OK to kill anyone no matter what the circumstance.  It is not the Stooges way.  The Stooges are the guys who take care of orphan babies, mom's in need, and in general fight the bad guys.  If you are starving The Stooges will cook their boots to feed you a meal of sole; they will go to jail for 20-to-life and bust rocks over Curly's head in order to right an injustice done to you, and if you are ill, they will put their own lives at risk riding through dangerous wild territories to bring you the medicine that will save your life, but a mercy killing???, No!, its just not stooges.  The writers, directors, producers, supporting cast, and especially the new three stooges actors themselves should all be getting eye pokes for eternity for allowing such a grossly wrong idea to be pushed as plot for a stooges movie.  Doing the Stooges is more than just repeating their gags.  You have to continue the Stooges legacy; so for this super poor judgment on everyone's part, I dock the movie two stars right off the bat.

BUT... once you get past the fact that these are three new guys... and you forgive for the stupidity of the plot error... you see that this is good stooges addition.  There is a lot to be recommended.

The three new actors got it down.  They work the basic stooges well.  The timing is good, the intensity is good, the emotion is good, and several of the gags you want to see are there.  Consider this:  I can't count how many times I have seen the ""falling stooges"" gag.  The stooges taking a fall from height was always done with three stuffed dummies bombed away, followed by a really bad cutover to three live ""dummies"" rolling on the ground.  So when I see Moe, Larry, and Curly jumping over the side of a building holding on to a fire hose I lean in because you know what I am waiting for.  Will I be able to make out the three dummies when they hit the ground?  Will it even be there for me to see?  The falling dummies gag is as much a three stooges signature as the eye poke and I want it.  Naturally not everything can be done in 100 minutes so there are gags you expected but did not see.  The ever popular ""Pick Two"", pie in the face, Curly making pancakes; there just is not enough room for it all.  But hey, that's OK, it just means there is room for another movie.

Also, there is reasonable balance here.  Some gags are over done.  For example, Curly changing diapers was great to start.  Anyone who has raised boys knows what happens when the diaper comes off and the cold air hits, so it is easy to believe this one.  It reminded me of Curly vs. the Clam.  Changing Diapers was a great gag that offered lots of opportunity for each of the stooges to show their stuff.  But it soon degenerates into a ""shootout"" with the stooges using babies as weapons.  A bad turn on what could have been stooges' awesomeness.

On the other hand, the stooges characters in this movie are in some ways better than the originals (can it be?).  I particularly liked the Larry character because he was a much stronger Larry than the original ""...how many buggers are we talking?"".  And the movie took some chances.  For example, they showed it was possible for NON-STOOGES to affectively do the stooges bits.  Best example was when Sofia Vergara was lifting up Craig Bierko over a wall, she gets the foot in the face mashing down no her nose.  This was never a great stooges gag, but it was a staple and always made me smile.  And these two did it just a well as the Original Stooges did.  So I was glad to see this movie growing the stooges routine in this way.

Indeed, one can even go so far as to say this movie offers some excellent SOCIAL COMMENTARY.  The Foot in the Face gag ultimately dumps Bierko into a Lion's Den (another familiar event in the stooges world (which Bierko does pretty well with as a bad guy)) and this sends a clear message to kids.  Don't be a bad guy, bad guys are even stupider than the stooges and who wants to be that dumb?  For the adults, after consideration of the events in the movie from the Reality TV angle, to the ending where the friend from the orphanage now rich refuses to help the orphanage even after the Stooges save his life (way lame), you realize that for all their bumbling innocence, when it comes to SOCIETY VS. THE THREE STOOGES... it is society that is all messed up, not the stooges.

But it is still a three star movie so far.  Even the good gags, character improvements, risk taking, and redeeming social commentary value can't make up for the huge plot error sitting in the back of your mind.  So what makes this a five star stooges addition?  Two things.

1) What is the purpose of this film?  If its purpose is for 100 minutes or so, to make you smile in a way that only the stooges can make you smile, then this movie succeeds whole heartedly in its mission.  This is not a movie that has you laughing uncontrollably (at least not me).  In fact, it was the well done trailers that had me rolling over.  But this is OK.  I have many of the original stooges shorts on cd and (dare I point it out) many of these shorts are not great shorts.  Few of them actually have me laughing out loud.  But they all have me smiling and loving the stooges.  This movie is the same way.  So for being a pretty good comedy, and for avoiding any of a thousand distractions during production that cold have turned this adventure bad, and thus being able to succeed in the main goal of glorifying the stooges and keeping me smiling and happy for its duration in the stooges way, it gets a star added back.

2) While watching the movie, if you are fortunate, you will recognize a completely new stooges gag.  It is totally Stooges and it is totally new.  There is a scene where these three guys work their way through a slapping frenzy that ultimately ties them in a knot, and culminates in ... the SIMULTANEOUS TRIPPLE EYE POKE.  To my knowledge this stunt was never performed by any combination of the original three stooges in any of their shorts or movies.  But when you see it done you realize it is a real three stooges stunt, it belongs to the three stooges and could be done by the stooges, and these three guys execute it flawlessly.  The idea of creating new original stooges material that could only be successful when done by the stooges would seem to me to be an impossibility.  Yet this movie did it.  Doing what should be impossible is worth an extra star.

And that is how this average three star comedy is really a five star stooges film.  This film is a worthy addition to the stooges lore.  These three guys got it down and I hope they make another movie real soon.

But overall the story line is shockingly crude and even sadistic.

There is a huge amount of sexual innuendo that makes this film totally in appropriate for children. Most every woman in the film is virtually topless with enormous breasts and deep cleavages.

There is much risque humor.

There is a shockingly cruel scene in the beginning where a man comes to select a child for adoption, and after carefully examining the choices before him goes to the smallest child in the group and seems ready to take him home and then at the last minute tells this child to inform the child next to him that he is the ""lucky adoptee"". Sick and depraved and bordering on child abuse!

There is also a lot of anti Catholic humor, as when the three boys are delivered to the doorstep of the Catholic orphanage and a nun exclaims: ""They're so beautiful. Like the Holy Trinity!""

Chris Diamantopoulos was uncanny as Moe, spot on perfect.  Sasso and Hayes were excellent as Curly and Larry.  I pictured Sasso as Curly years ago.  The kids who played The Three Stooges in the early part of the movie were also perfectly cast.  What makes this movie so special to me is I grew up in the sixties watching The Three Stooges on TV.  This movie captures the essence of the original stooges with what appears to me to be little or no computer animation thank God.  This is a comedy for the whole family.  The Three Stooges made over three hundred short films and rightfully won an Academy Award for short subject I believe back in the late 1930's.  These Three Stooges handled the slapstick with the same comedic precision as the original stooges.  There are several scenes shot the same way the original was done i.e. dummies thrown over a wall dressed like the stooges, then switching to the live stooges right after landing on the ground.  I thought that was brilliant to keep with the old traditional and original style of filming.  Other directors might have made all the slapstick scenes with a computer.  I thank the Farrelly brothers for this movie because it was just like an extra special episode of The Three Stooges.  I'm sure the families of Moe Howard, Curly Howard and Larry Fine would be very proud of this film.  There are several other name stars who appear in this movie, Larry David as Sister Mary Mengele very funny.  I hope for a few more episodes.  This movie made a 54 year old man laugh and be happy to see there are still some people in Hollywood who can redo a classic act the way they would have done it then.  The fact that this was shot in color in no way hurts the feel of the movie.  To those who think it's all just about slapping one another, listen to the very funny dialogue.

One thing they couldve done without is putting those Morons from The Jersey Shore in the film, that was just stupid and i suppose it was only to Appeal to the new generation but its forgiveable as they aren't in the film for that long and Moe gives em what for. My favorite part of the film is without a doubt Will Sasso's role as Curly. He gives such a great performance and gets everything down perfectly. I'm sure the man himself would've been proud. I can't wait for the future sequel(s)! Hopefully they are as good and fun as this.",1358553600,,949,4.337078651685394

4863516,5,B005S9EL3K,"I believe a huge shout out HAS to go to the movie writers and directors.  They made sure Moe, Larry and Curly were incredibly faithful to their original characters that many of us grew up watching and loving.  I've always said the Three Stooges is the funniest show you'll ever see in black and white, and the movie version does NOT disappoint.

There's a couple amazing things about this movie.  I find it interesting that Moe, Larry and Curly still act like they did back in the 30's, 40's and 50's when they became successful, and yet, they're introduced to a new world with computer technology, cell phones and twitter.  The film mentions many of these things.  It really IS the Stooges brought into the current world.

Another surprising highlight is how Moe and Larry look EXACTLY like the real Moe Howard and Larry Fine.  What are the odds that two people who look exactly like the originals could not only be found, but play the role of Moe Howard and Larry Fine so convincingly accurate?  It's not like you see Moe's walking down the street everyday- I've seen a few people that resemble Moe, but never to a startling extent like the guy in this movie.  The same applies to Larry.  As for Curly, well, thousands of people look like him so that wasn't really a hard find.

My point here is that it's a minor miracle that not do these guys look like Moe, Larry and Curly, but are able to *act* extremely close to them as well.

I guess some people might not like the fact that Shemp isn't in the movie anywhere.  Well even though I love Shemp, Curly is the one most people identify with the Three Stooges.  Hey, if this movie has a sequel, I'd love for a Shemp to be in it somewhere.  Dare I say, perhaps even serve as a replacement for Curly.

As for this movie, well it's based around a movie-length storyline instead of the short segments we're accustomed to.  It's about the Three Stooges having to find a way to make over 800,000 dollars to save an orphanage from going under.  How they make the money is hilarious and significantly more elaborate than what you'd see in the original short Stooges stories of years ago.  Anyone who knows a thing or two about the Three Stooges can pretty much figure out what to expect.  Several crazy antics!  Needless to say, I *still* find this type of humor really funny despite how many times I've seen it done before.

Nice detail devoting several minutes to the Three Stooges as young kids, and especially the one with Moe being adopted and getting to know his new parents.  Really good segment.  Favorite segment?  It's a toss up between the commotion that the Stooges find themselves in at the hospital and especially the baby peeing incident, and the emotional one with Larry and Curly finally becoming fed up with Moe's bossy nature- really emotional scene here that might come as a shock to any really big Stooges fan from the black and white days.

This is seriously a hilarious movie.  All the face slapping, eye poking, head smacking, ladder collapsing bumps and hits that you've loved in the original can be found once again right here.  A perfectly executed update to a classic and influential type of comedy- I went in expecting this to be a low budget attempt at recapturing the Stooges only to be pleasantly delighted and the accurate portrayal.  Will watch again.  Oh and the song that occasionally comes and goes, and is heard again during the credits (called ""Waste"" by Foster The People) has an EXTREMELY catchy chorus!",1357430400,2,3488,4.586429725363489

4863523,3,B005S9EL3K,"Was truly, GENUINELY surprised by how much I liked this film ... mainly because they got it RIGHT.  Will Sasso, Sean Hayes and Chris Diamantopoulos have Curly, Larry and Moe (respectively) down to perfection; so much so, after awhile you forget it's them, which is a real feat for a die-hard Stooge fan like me.  The story, much like a Stooges short, is about the boys leaving their orphanage and heading for the big city, trying to raise enough money to keep the orphanage from being sold and all the kids from going to foster homes - and the ensuing pratfalls and sight gags and eye pokes, etc. that ensue are genuinely funny and engaging, even seeing the stooges in a more modern-day setting.  A supporting cast that includes Sofia Vergara, Craig Bierko, Jane Lynch, Jennifer Hudson, Stephen Collins, Larry David (hilarious!), Brian Doyle-Murray, and cast members of ""Jersey Shore"" (yes, you read that right) only add to the bizarre appeal of what is actually a very good homage to one of the greatest comedy teams in film history.

4863642,4,B005S9EL3K,"The Three Stooges: The Movie (2012). Rated ""PG"". Running Time: 91 minutes.
Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly.
Watching this movie was like a knock on the head.

Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Shemp Howard was a comedy team from vaudeville.  They were discovered and made short film comedies for the movie houses. At the time of their beginnings, their was no television yet. With their first film, Soup to Nuts (1930), Moe was the age of 33 and continued with The Three Stooges to the end in 1969 at the age of 72. Larry Fine was 28 and continued to the age of 68. Shemp left the act and found work in Vitaphone film comedies. Curly Howard, joined the team in 1932 with his brother Moe, and vaudeville performer Larry Fine. The team was renamed ""The Three Stooges"" in 1934.
  After Curly had a horrible stroke in May 1946, at only the age of 42, he could no longer perform well, however he made one last film appearance, after his stroke, with his brothers, including Shemp (who returned to replaced Curly), in Hold That Lion! (1947). He died in 1952.
 Joe Besser joined the team in 1956-57. Joe DeRita as ""Curly Joe"" joined for 1958-69. A total of 220 films were made of ""The Three Stooges"". They also appeared on television.
  I must confess, I never did like The Three Stooge when I was young because I thought they were violent and mean to each other. I did not like the slapping and the hitting, which was called ""slapstick comedy"".
  It was the motion picture, Snow White and The Three Stooges (1961), in color, when I began to relax watching The Three Stooges. I still like this film.
  In 2012, to pay homage to the comedy team that has since passed away from us, 20th Century Fox has cast Chris Diamantopoulos as ""Moe"", Sean Hayes as ""Larry"" and Will Sasso as ""Curly"" in this new movie, The Three Stooges"". It offers us the story of what if The Three Stooges lived in today's world as themselves. The brother, ""Shemp"", is not in this movie.
  I was blown away by Chris Diamantopoulous performance as ""Moe"" and Will Sasso was right on.  Sean Hayes used the New York accent to play ""Larry"", but it looked like Sean Hayes in a red hair wig to me. The real ""Larry"" had a bigger nose.
 I did have some laughs and I probably enjoyed this movie more than I have enjoyed the original black & white ones. I did find Larry David annoying as a nun.

 Also in the cast: Jane Lynch, Stephen Collins, Brian Doyle-Murray, Jennifer Hudson, Antonio Sabato Jr.

4863644,4,B005S9EL3K,This movie has somehow made my son and husband bond closer. They laugh and share jokes. Having a teenage boy want to watch a movie with his dad these days is special. You have to love this type of humor to appreciate the jokes.,1355356800,,227,4.181818181818182

4863687,4,B005S9EL3K,"It is very clear that the script writers and everyone involved has a strong fondness for the original 3 stooges. this update is much better than I could have hoped for. I took my dad to it, he hadnt been to a movie in 30 years. He thoroughly enjoyed the movie which is a testament in its own write to the faithfullness to the original stooges. the modernization was a real treat to anyone who has been a longstanding stooges fan. there is plenty to recognize from the orignal stooges with enough new to satisfy all audiences.",1355356800,,525,4.422680412371134
4863688,3,B005S9EL3K,"I found it nice that modern film makers would make a tribute to the zany, slapstick comedy of the Three Stooges. The film is well done, and very well performed by the actors. Some of the visual anecdotes are predictable, but who cares, really?

I reckon that this movie is mostly recommended to Three Stooges fans, but whoever is interested in film history should have a look at it, without prejudice for the displayed violence.",1355184000,,428,4.706666666666667
4863689,4,B005S9EL3K,I went in to watch this movie with no expectations but was pleasantly surprised.  They covered all of the better schticks except the walking cooked chicken/turkey scaring everyone schtick.  I missed my original friends but these three mugs stepped into their shoes very well.,1355097600,,275,5.2272727272727275

4863692,3,B005S9EL3K,"Expected more but OK, C grade instead of B grade. Larry character not very good. Moe good, Curly better than larry but still not nearly as good as Curly Howard.",1354924800,,160,4.366666666666666
4863693,4,B005S9EL3K,"similar in many ways to Moe, Larry and Curly, these guys just need more practice. it was true stooge humor but lacked the vaudville touch the real stooges were able to hammer out short after short!!!!!",1354924800,,201,4.611111111111111
4863694,5,B005S9EL3K,"I got this for my Hubby, and what guy doesn't love the stooges. We saw this movie in the theater and it was just as hilarious as the old stooges. These actors captured their mannerisms and it kept my Husband laughing throughout.",1354924800,,228,4.4523809523809526

4863708,4,B005S9EL3K,"If you liked the original Three Stooges, you'd like this movie.  The same basic stunts.  The same basic plot line.  Nothing very original here.  Something like ""The Three Stooges goes to Mars"" would be interesting, but would never happen.",1354406400,,238,5.0256410256410255
4863709,3,B005S9EL3K,"The actors do a great job imitating the originals. The story about their lives from childhood kinda didn't fit with my well grooved memories of the real wiseguys. Kids however, would probably really enjoy.",1354406400,,205,5.0588235294117645

I was floored with how well they made these guys look like the original.

And i found it funny!

If you are a Stooges fan... i recommend this movie.

If you are not a Stooges fan... rent at your own risk.

My wife could not stand this movie... but i loved it!  I look forward to the next one!",1353542400,,365,4.0

4863740,5,B005S9EL3K,I was worried before watching this that I would be disappointed.  But no.  This was the funniest movie I've seen in 30 years.  Everyone was laughing through the movie.  I only wish there would be another movie.  I give it 5 polk in the eyes.,1353196800,,241,4.266666666666667

4863743,5,B005S9EL3K,"The genius of the Farrelly Brothers giving the ""The Three Stooges"" a contemporary setting is that it underscores the timelessness of the trio's antics.  It also highlights the fact that the boys were more than great physical comiedians but verbal ones as well.  The movie is impeccably cast with Sean Hayes(Larry), Chris Diamontopoulos(Moe), and Will Sasso(Curly) not just sporting the clothes of their predecessors but channeling the spirits of Messrs. Howard, Fine, and Howard.  Great supporting cast that includes Jane Lynch, Jennifer Hudson, Larry David(as a nun no less) and Brian Doyle-Murray.  Sofia Vergara more than fills the bill as the requisite eye candy.  The highest compliment that can be paid this film is my six year old niece loves it and has seen it at least a dozen times.  I think her favorite scene are the boys' hijinks in the hospital maternity ward.  Personally my favorite was the passing shot of the nun in habit sporting a teensie weensie bikini.",1353024000,,974,5.012422360248447
4863744,4,B005S9EL3K,What can I say?  It was funny and they did a great job of reviving those classic characters.  I hope they make another one. :),1352851200,,126,4.0
4863784,4,B005S9EL3K,The stooge actors and the kid version of the stooges were amazing! It was the surrounding ineptness of the rest of the actors that made it a bit of a mess. I loved the originals and I liked this too.,1352764800,,199,4.0
4863785,5,B005S9EL3K,"Movie was good.not like the good old three stooges though.older is always better in my opinion ,take it as you want to",1352505600,,118,4.409090909090909
4863786,4,B005S9EL3K,"I liked this movie a lot because the three main actors had the three stooges down to a tee.  Some parts were a bit silly but all in all, it was true to form.",1352419200,,157,3.6176470588235294
4863787,4,B005S9EL3K,I downloaded the movie onto my Kindle Fire for my kids to watch on a recent plane ride.  I could hear the laughs and chuckles from time to time and both agreed that it was worth watching.,1352419200,,187,4.054054054054054
4863788,5,B005S9EL3K,"Ok, let me just say that I am a true die hard fan of the old black and white three stooges show. I have all 8 ""Volumes"" on dvd. But When I heard that hollywood was coming out with an actual three stooges movie I had my doubts. Like the saying goes you can't never replace a classic right? Well I was dead wrong on this one. Turns out that saying doesn't actually apply to everything. Chris Diamantopoulos did a wounderful job playing the bad boy leader of the three Moe. Sean Hayes was great as the curled haired middle stooge Larry. Last but not least and was alway's my most favorite out of all the stooges was Curly played by the very talented Will Sasso. I was also surprised to see Jane Lynch star as one of the nuns. I loved her in ""Two and a half Men"". There was plenty of gut busting laughs and tears. I also liked the fact that even undernieth all the slapstick they did to eachother they really did care for eachother. After seeing this you won't be dissapointed. Those of you who dissagree's with the film that's fine too. Everyone has different views. I loved it! Bring on a sequel 20th Centry Fox with the same actor's returning!!",1352332800,3,1143,4.296296296296297
4863789,3,B005S9EL3K,"My review may be biased as when I was younger I got to watch the original Three Stooges, and they always cracked me up.  As to this new version, well it had a few moments, but overall it was really corny and not as funny as the originals.",1352332800,,238,3.9583333333333335
4863790,1,B005S9EL3K,These actors did a fair job with the common routines of the original stooges.  But this movie is not worth anyone's time.  Varations of this same plot have been done more times than one can count.  The writers should be far beyond just embarassed.  Shame on them.,1352332800,2,263,4.531914893617022
4863791,4,B005S9EL3K,My favorite part......the babies at the hospital!!  You have to watch it to know what I am talking about :),1352160000,,107,4.35
4863792,3,B005S9EL3K,"Not even close to the hilarious original ""Three Stooges"", but I did find myself letting out a few belly laughs. Since I paid $5.48 including shipping & handling I feel it was money well spent.",1352073600,,192,4.514285714285714

4863814,5,B005S9EL3K,"This film is very funny if that's what you like in a comedy, the actors are quite precise in there acting of
the original stooges and if nothing else it may get the viewer to look at the original stooges.",1351641600,2,204,4.125
4863815,3,B005S9EL3K,"If you like the Stooges, you'll like this. It is a modernized version of the classic story. Only get if you are a true Stooges fan.",1351555200,,131,4.076923076923077
4863816,2,B005S9EL3K,"My suggestion if there is even a thought of a sequel is please don't do it.  Let the Larry, Moe and Curly legacy ""rest in peace"".  This particular effort wasn't close to how the original Stooges performed their slapstick comedy.",1351382400,,228,4.675
4863817,4,B005S9EL3K,"If you are a Stooges fan, I think you will enjoy this movie. If not - you probably won't. Lots of cheap laughs. It brought back memories of laughing at the Stooges in the old days with my brothers.",1351209600,,197,4.076923076923077
4863818,4,B005S9EL3K,"The actors do an amazing job of channeling Larry, Curly and Moe. The plot is typical Three Stooges, but the sight gags had me laughing out loud. If you are a fan of the Three Stooges, you won't be disappointed with this movie.",1351036800,,226,4.27906976744186
4863819,5,B005S9EL3K,"I was always a huge Three Stooges fan, so I introduced the old black and white shorts to my daughter.  So seeing that the movie was on Amazon we decided to make it a family night movie.  The new movie captured the true essence of the characters plus gives you some funny, but also interesting back story about Moe, Larry, and Curly.  Also, the actor who played Curly did such a great job you could not tell if you were watching the old shorts or the new movie.",1350950400,,460,4.204545454545454
4863820,4,B005S9EL3K,"if you're a baby boomer, chances are you grew up watching officer Joe Bolton introducing the Three Stooges on your old black and white tv.

i enjoyed seeing the antics played again.  story line was ok, but would appeal to the young ones!

BTW, the casting was awesome!!!",1350950400,,270,4.583333333333333
4863821,4,B005S9EL3K,This movie was silly and kind of cheesy but still fun.  Our whole family watched it together and it had all of us laughing.,1350950400,,123,4.125
4863822,5,B005S9EL3K,It was one of the best comedies I'd seen in a long time. If you like the stooges you'll love the movie.,1350864000,,103,3.727272727272727
4863823,5,B005S9EL3K,it's a modern day three stooges. the three stooges weren't just slapstick but current day humor for their times---likewise so is this movie. Funny funny movie. will be watching it for years to come and the whole family can watch!,1350777600,,229,4.75
4863903,4,B005S9EL3K,good fun time movie for those who remember the original B&W  three stooges movies on Saturday afternoons  nicely done good safety commentary at the end of the movie for those kids who just don't quite seem to get it,1350691200,,215,4.487179487179487
4863904,5,B005S9EL3K,"I previewed this before my 5 & 7 yr old boys were able to watch it. In our house we don't use words like dummy, idiot, stupid, etc. Appropriate, non- offensive, absolutely hilarious!  I was so pleased that this is a funny, goofy movie the whole family could enjoy.",1350432000,,264,4.387755102040816
4863905,4,B005S9EL3K,The actors selected for the Stooges all did an excellent job in portraying their characters.  It seemed as though one was actually watching the original Three Stooges.,1350432000,,167,5.185185185185185
4863906,5,B005S9EL3K,"I was a little leery going into this movie.  I loved the original 3 stooges shorts, and so I was worried about this movie.  I must say, I thought the movie blew me away.  They could not have picked 3 better people to play the stooges.  The look, the humor and everything else was PERFECT.  I will be buying this on blu-ray to add to my MUST HAVE collection at home.  I am very critical of any remakes or re-imagining of any old movies, shows, etc. and this one passes with flying colors.  Watch this puppy if you love the 3 stooges.",1350345600,3,532,4.1568627450980395
4863907,1,B005S9EL3K,They tried way too hard to make the movie funny and it just didn't work for me. I think I laughed a few times. It was also too dark and not appropriate for children. Should have been rated pg-13.,1350345600,3,195,4.0256410256410255
4863908,3,B005S9EL3K,The movie was very funny in some parts and it is something that the whole family can enjoy. I do not remember any foul language or overly sexual situations.,1350345600,2,156,4.413793103448276

4863910,5,B005S9EL3K,"The first time I watched this I was caught up in the Stooge slap-stick and physical comedy which is great and in the Stooge tradition with the three actors
doing a great job copying the original Stooges. The second time I watched I laughed even more because I caught all the one-liners and puns and the film is
loaded with them.
No profanity,no nudity,rated PG for a few adult sight gags.
All the pratfalls,puns,gags,come faster than you can catch in one viewing. Just a real fun movie to watch.
Larry David in drag is the big scene stealer in the movie,funny,funny.",1350259200,,566,4.6138613861386135

The high points were Will Sasso and Sean Hayes; they were dead-on hits as Curly and Larry.

The rest of the cast made a just so-so movie about these Three Legends truly awful.

At times, it was like trying to watch a Stooges short that featured Joe DeRita instead of The Legend himself, Curly.

A real shame, too.",1349481600,2,405,4.583333333333333
4863969,3,B005S9EL3K,This was a poor substitue for the original 3 stooges.  Curly was the only character to come close.  I do realize it is difficult to take the original of the old classic comedy and remake them.  Little rascals is another example. People that grew up with these will find it difficult to adapt to the new ones.,1349481600,,308,4.368421052631579

4863971,1,B005S9EL3K,Awful movie. Plot is not bad but the actor playing. moe  was a little overkill. The set of different scenes was not bad but adding Jersey Shore was stupid,1349481600,,154,4.310344827586207

4864025,2,B005S9EL3K,"I must admit, as being a Stooge Fan, I did enjoy most of the scenes in this film. The three actors looked, sounded, and acted just like the originals (except... the one that played Larry... he looked more like Clint Howard?! Because of his eyes???). Anyway, I give it a 2 star rating for the following reasons...

Instead of making this film for adults and children alike, the film makers leaned more towards mindless youngsters! They made the oh too familiar mistake of thinking there was a need for cutsie children actors to be in the film just to attract the very young crowd? The storyline would've survived quite well without this, as I remember MOST Stooge shorts had no need for it!

Then, there's what ended up on the editing room floor...
Lucky there's a ""deleted scenes"" extra on the DVD. Here you'll find about 8 or 9 scenes that should have remained in the film. It would have made the unedited scenes much more ""stooge-like"", and the film funnier. I can only imagine these bits cut because maybe too violent or sexual innuendo (come on?... It's like the Stooges... that's what the originals did best!!!)???

And then there's that final INSULT to all you idiots and non-idiots alike out there...
At he end of the film (just before the credits), the two film makers appear and tell all you folks out there, ""WARNING... DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!!"". Then they go on to show that the hammers and tools in the film were made of rubber. Then they proceed to show you that poking in the eyes was done not by aiming the fingers in the eyes, but just above, hitting the eyebrows. [Yet, if you playback the scene where Moe sits next to Snooki. He tells her look in the box, and it's Moe's hand... AND HE DOES POKE HER IN THE EYES (if you play back in slow motion, you'll see Snooki close her eyes first before the fingers hit)]
But anyways.... REALLY????  YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING??!!!  Do the children of today really need to be told this? Come on, let's try and give the kids (well most kids) some credit out there?!!!!!!  I know when I watched the original Three Stooges when I was a child (not those awful movies with that retard Curly-Joe), I knew enough not to do those kind of things I saw!

So, finally the end credits also had to have an ending song/video included. Since ""Shrek"", seems we can't have a children's movie end without some kind of new version of a popular older song. In this case, the song, ""It's A Shame"" was chosen... wise choice, as it's title really describes the final outcome of this film as a whole!

Well, with the material I have on this DVD and my computer with all it's wonderful software, I will be able to re-edit this film and burn my more watchable, funnier version to DVD (for my own personal use). I will be cutting out all the cutsie bits and putting the ""deleted"" bits back in. Of course, those idiot filmmakers at the end will definitely have to go too. This should bring my final version closer to the Stooge level it should have had from the start?!!",1349308800,4,2996,4.444444444444445

Anyway, going into this movie I was expecting it to be awful.  But, my seven year old son really wanted to see it, so we rented it for family movie night. I was shocked when the film wasn't horrible. I was even more shocked when I laughed in several spots. I was very shocked when it was over and I thought, ""That was a fun little movie.""
Keep in mind, this is not masterpiece. However, it is a fun, short movie that knows what it is, sticks to that, and doesn't aspire to be much.
The actors do a great job impersonating the real Three Stooges (from the Curly era, of course). And the fellow playing Larry actually sounds like Larry Fine. Come to think of it, Moe and Curly sound like...well...Moe and Curly.
I liked that the movie was clean and suitable for my whole family. My son laughed hysterically, as did my five year old daughter. So, even though this film isn't Oscar caliber, it was worth every penny to hear my children laughing so hard. And, as a bonus, it has gotten my son interested in the original Stooges.

4864084,2,B005S9EL3K,"As a big fan of the original Three Stooges, I felt I needed to see this movie, although I dreaded it. The positive part of me hoped that it would be a cute homage to the originals, not as good, but enjoyable on its own, similar to the Little Rascals movie. The negative part expected it to be an insult to the stooges' memory.

What I got was actually a little of both. While the impressions of the Stooges were surprisingly good, especially Will Sasso's Curly, the general concept was not faithful to the originals. The stooges are supposed to be chaos in an otherwise normal world. Their relationships with others hinge on the fact that the other people assume they are normal at the start, but learn over time that they are stooges and are upset by their antics. In other words, the world is the straight-man to the comedy of the stooges. This movie goes completely against that premise. From the very beginning we are made to believe that there is something wrong with these boys, but that there is also something strange and/or funny about everyone else in the world. From the singing nun (Jennifer Hudson) to the overtly perfect and cute little boy to the evil and conniving wife (Sofia Vergara), these people are far from normal. I mean, how could the cast of Jersey Shore ever be the normal to the stooges' odd?

Another thing that irked me about this movie was that it was pushed as a family film with family values and wholesome jokes. There is even a disclaimer at the end urging kids not to try to smack each other like the stooges do. The original films were fun for young and old alike not because Columbia pandered to children but because the comedy was universal and ageless. These film makers should not have tried so hard to aim at a niche.

Finally, a nitpick: there is no appearance of Shemp, which I am sorry for. He is definitely the neglected stooge, and it would have been nice to see a small ""hi-ya Shemp"" thrown in there for the fans.",1347408000,4,1960,4.4692737430167595

The next sequel should include a modern Shemp version. What fans never got to experience before, should be awesome in the sequel THE FOUR STOOGES. Then follow that up and include a Joe Besser version and call it THE FIVE STOOGES.

With that said though, I found the movie itself to be very funny and original in it's own right. I like that the movie was broken down into small vignettes, much like the shorts of the original Stooges. The three actors that played Moe, Larry and Curly did a commendably good job of potraying the original three. The one thing about them that kept bothering me though was their heights. I know, it's a minor thing and certainly not something that an actor can help, but the original Stooges were all very short which gave them a more child like quality, always looking up at the big people around them.

4864296,1,B005S9EL3K,"I was introduced to The Three Stooges by my grandfather, and we'd watch them every afternoon on WTBS when the shorts aired amidst a Warner Brothers cartoon show. The Stooges have been a part of my life ever since, and when I first learned they were re-making the Stooges, I was curious but concerned that, like so many re-makes and/or retellings, that this film would be an embarrassing disaster and a slap in the face (no pun intended) to the original.

I mean, seriously, within the 1st 90 seconds, I knew The Three Stooges was going to be horrible. Plot and situation wise, The Three Stooges reminded me of the formulaic, weak-minded remake movies that came out in the mid-90s.

The film has a few funny moments, and the impersonations of the Stooges are okay and mildly amusing; in subtle ways, it's obvious that the filmmakers had knowledge of the classic Stooges shorts, but with that said, it's dumbfounding how and why anyone who respected and enjoyed the classics would be involved with a remake or retelling this pathetic.

Modernizing the characters was an interesting concept (ever wonder what havoc Curly can wreak with a chainsaw or his reaction to an Iphone?) but this novelty quickly wore out and ""got no where fast.""

Making this atrocity even worse, the film involved the cast of The Jersey Shore ... okay, what a great way to merge two pop culture phenomenons, one from the past and one from the (shudder) present. This creates an interesting juxtaposition: The Stooges and The Jersey Shore, the former remembered and enjoyed for more than 70 years as comedic icons with the latter being human train wrecks and examples of what our society currently calls entertainment. Truly, if anyone dares watch this movie 50 years from now, viewers will obviously know Moe, Larry and Curly ... but will anyone remember The Jersey Shore? Probably not. The Jersey Shore element really tainted anything good about this film, and it's really indicative of what little pop culture knowledge and longevity the filmmakers have. (I have personal shame that I actually discussed The Jersey Shore in this great length ... it's a sad day for me when I have been exposed to anything involving The Jersey Shore, let alone the notion of actually writing, albeit negatively, about it!)

If you believed that the Three Stooges needed to be remade and/or modernized, geez, several ideas instantly come to mind that could have and would have maintained the integrity of Moe, Larry and Curly; instead, this shoddy affair seems more like an opportunity to cash in on a commodity versus producing a loving and caring tribute.",1346716800,11,2612,4.873873873873874

4864345,2,B005S9EL3K,"I am a little surprised this movie gets about a 50% rating on RottenTomatoes.com.  I guess that shows there are at least two types of Stooges fans out there: those who are purists and did not feel this movie could work, and those who are either Farrelly Brothers fans or are just impressed by good Stooges impersonators.  The latter probably did not really care one way or another whether the movie is in color, is set in modern times, and has music in the background (none of those things were in the originals, and do not work for me).  I think more of those who did not have this purist approach have weighed in here on this movie, since at the time I wrote this the average rating on Amazon was 4 stars.  The same people who gave 4 or more stars probably don't mind listening to cover bands rather than the real thing.  That's all fine, but more often than not the original is better.  In the Stooges case, the original is a LOT better.

When this movie was first known to be in the planning stages, I was excited.  Being a long-time Stooges fan but knowing I would never have a chance to direct something like this, I was hoping whoever did would do a GREAT job.  In general, I was very disappointed.  The three Stooge characters (Chris Diamantopoulos as Moe, Sean Hayes as Larry, and Will Sasso as Curly) are very talented and gave it their best shots.  That's where the positives end.

So many people said this movie should never be made.  I thought it might be worth a shot, but it would really take a lot for it to work.  This movie does not, and now I can see those detractors were right.  I can't say I have seen every movie that is a remake from some earlier film (TV or theatrical).  It's generally not a good idea. An exception is the Brady Bunch Movie, which was great since it was a spoof of a show I pretty much despised.  Also, the Batman movies are more serious than the TV version (more like the actual comic strip), so those movies have gone in a different direction.  But on to the Stooges.

At least for me (and almost anyone else I discussed this movie with before it was released), the Stooges belong in their 30's or 40's environment, or before that time, such as in their Civil War episodes, or out in the Old West, or the Pilgrim Days, etc.  Here are some things I think would have made the movie more appealing:
-Black and white.  Even the colorized versions of the originals on YouTube do not look as good as the black and whites.
-Same ""'30's-40's"" vintage look as the originals (including the same ""change of scenes"" look; reference the originals to see what I mean)
-Story lines from those times or before, but in a new or different situation or time.
-No musical background, unless it is incidental to the episode (like an orchestra in the background as part of the story line, etc.).  Mood or rock music does not suit the Stooges.
-Great character actors (Vernon Dent, Bud Jamison and several others really made those original episodes that much better)
-Using the REAL introductory music for each episode.  The movie used some karaoke version, and at that played about half of it.  What's the hurry?  Was the original music too expensive?
-Showing each Stooge interacting with the character actors on their own, rather than needing to be together ALL the time as they are in this movie (except for part of the film when Moe was off on his own).  The originals made good use of this.
-Having the three Stooge characters more the same size.  All of them should be a bit dumpy.  Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) and Larry  (Sean Hayes) were too thin, and Curly (Will Sasso) was too tall.  Picky, yes, but critical to the interaction of the characters and the multi-head clunking situations.
-Less overacting by the characters.  Again, Chris, Sean and Will really are very talented, but with better direction and writing, they could have been either closer to the originals, or possibly as funny in a different way if given better stories.  A lot of the scenes seemed to have the characters trying too hard to mimic things the original characters did.  The original characters seemed to have some new wrinkle in each episode, with very little copying from one episode to the next.
-Having three unrelated, very different stories, rather than the three connected stories in the movie.
-Think more like, ""If Curly was OK and never had his strokes, what would have his next episodes been like?""  Talk about a lofty goal for this film, but worth the shot.

If all of the things I mentioned did happen in the movie, most likely it still would never match the originals, but at very least it could have been a lot better than the ""Joe's"" (sorry Joe Besser, it just wasn't your calling).

It's tough to sound fair through all of this, and I'm sure I sound very critical.  The originals (or at least most of them before Curly had his strokes) were just so good.  I say all this because there was a lot of time to get this movie ready, and I just feel the whole direction was wrong.  The two stars here is a bit generous.  All of that is for the efforts of the Stooge characters.  However, I disagree their performances were ""spot on"" as some reviewers have mentioned.  Just watch 5 or 10 minutes of this movie and compare it to a similar amount of time in any of the better Curly episodes.  I think you will agree.  The original characters have a lot more multi-dimensional attitudes, expressions, mannerisms, etc. that did not come across in this movie. A chunk of this movie might have been OK for a 5-minute Saturday Night Live skit, but that's about it.  I only hope that skit would not include the typical Farrelly gross-out humor, as seen in the movie's maternity ward scene.  Truly a waste of film, but enough said about that.

I hope a sequel to this film never comes out, because most likely it would continue in a similar modern direction this one took.  If it were to go in the more ""vintage"" direction (and with different directors), I would be glad to keep an eye on how it goes.  Despite all my rantings here, believe it or not I do have a life outside the Stooges (well, at least I've never gone to the Stooge conventions).",1346025600,,6156,4.48294434470377

4864348,4,B005S9EL3K,"In this era of Hollywood remakes and sequels, it's not surprising that somebody eventually made a remake of the Three Stooges. Fortunately, this movie is respectful of the classics and really captures the spirit of the original characters. Sean Hayes, Chris Diamantopoulos, and Will Sasso as Larry, Moe, and Curly resemble their black and white counterparts both physically and in their acting. Diamantopoulos is dead on as Moe, while Sasso really captured Curly's energy.

The film does make the Three Stooges more modern, but not by abandoning the traditional Three Stooges humor. The film is full of slapstick comedy. The movie even recreates the sound effects from the originals. While some modern viewers might find this corny, it's nice to see an audience for this lighthearted, non-vulgar humor.

The film treads on more perilous grounds when it puts Moe on a reality TV show. Jersey Shore even makes an appearance. Fortunately, even here the director was careful to make this a Three Stooges movie. Rather than the Three Stooges becoming more like Jersey Shore, we get to see Moe poke Snooki's eyes and slap the male cast members. While I would have preferred to leave Jersey Shore entirely out of this movie, it doesn't overshadow the Three Stooges.

Just really well done. Everything was, as it was. You could almost guess how a scene was going to turn out.  If you loved the old stooges you will love the new ones.

One person did say that... recall the original 3 stooges were shorts ~20 min each and an hour an a half of the new stooges can get overdone. I guess that can be true but if you love the stooges you will sit through this film just rolling with laughter.

Maybe superimposing their comedy style against a 2012 backdrop makes it out of place and ruins the comedy element, I don't know.  All I do know is that this remake that seems to try to follow the classic without blowing thing out of proportion and fails to elicit any laughter like the 1930's originals.  How is what they were doing back then - which was ""over-the-top"" came off as ""over-the-top"" trying but getting nowhere?  Maybe if I never saw the original.  Perhaps.  If that IS the case how is it that spoof movies like ""Airplane"", ""Naked Gun"" (first two movies), and the remake of ""Dragnet"" worked very well?  The idea in these movies was obviously ""over-the-top"".  Unfortunately, efforts in the Three Stooges remake come off as stupid for he most part.  Now the reality show part seemed like a good direction to take the trio in a 2012 world but since the movie did not spend most of it's time with this idea, I can't be sure.  While Hollywood did not vandalize a classic like they did with ""Dukes of Hazzard"" or ""The Brady Bunch"", they just couldn't capitalize on it either.",1345248000,3,1141,4.5763546798029555

4864394,3,B005S9EL3K,"The comic routines, generally spot on, and, frankly, the fellow playing Curley is a better Stooge (I can hear hisses and boos) than the original Curley Howard.

I'm a huge Stooge fan.  Yes, their comic routines make me laugh out loud, funny.  But since I went to work over 30 years ago, attempted to force my way into the middle class and failed utterly, what gets me about the Three Stooges is the implied social commentary.  I swear, I swear on a stack of Bibles, that I've worked with clones of all these guys, Larry, Moe, Curley, Shemp, Joe Besser, and Curley Joe, at every job I've held since Captain & Tennille held the top of the Hot-100.  Every routine, every short they've done is an example of heightened reality.  Their plumbing routines screwups I've witnessed in my life again and again with landlords' handy-man fix-it casual laborers (guy kept telling me it was the ""swirly action"" that cleared my toilet and kept waiting me out without doing anything; when I pulled the fixture off the floor, I had to point out the upstairs' neighbors' flushed socks and plastic diapers were actually clogging the line going out, and the grease plug from the upstairs' kitchen mixing with soap why the basement flooded each time the upstairs flushed their toilets into my bathtub.  The Utah State Liquor Store across the street held a great fascination for his time there, too.); my brother's had the 'Stooges working with him in several Utah bakeries--if you've found the occasional bolt or screw in your bread, it's his local 'Stooges.  I've seen these guys on so many of my middle-school playground duties that it defies description.  Watch the 'Stooges' costumes evolve from the low-class prole clown outfits from the Depression into decently fitting low-middle class double-breasted suits and you get how WWII changed the U.S., called 'Stooges ""middle class"" and we still ain't in on THAT joke!

The routines in the movie generally work.  I agree with another reviewer that the hospital baby urine war doesn't.  My favorite piece, however, is the fish farm gag.  For the routines, YES!  However, the story is fluff, and while it's possible that I miss the social class sendups because I'm too close to the 2012 world in this movie, it's padded.  There are moments, but those story moments come both too fast and too slow.

And I had a surprise, a local art culture kind of surprise when viewing the movie.  Sofia Vergara's ""actual"" husband in the film, the trade-in orphan when the adoptive couple returned Moe, who grew up rich and privileged, is played by Kirby Heyborne, a staple of LDS Mormon cinema, such as THE SINGLES WARD, THE BEST TWO YEARS, and my favorite local (as in gloriously ironic, tongue-in-cheek comedy) Utah LDS send-up, the Mormon version THIS IS SPINAL TAP ode to boy bands (yes, true), SONS OF PROVO movie.  He's made a transition to mainstream movies.  Sofia Vergara was great eye candy, and suggests a character in a 1955-ish 'Stooges short, Hell-en Blazes, in a scene where Shemp stands at the gates of Heaven, and Hell-en Blazes vamps away to lead Shemp to the other place (Provo)....

I wish I could get back the time spent in watching this turkey. As it is, I watched it on pay per view, $4.99. I almost called the cable company to get my money back.

A BIG mistake to try to duplicate one of the Three Stooges shorts; no one did it better than the originals. Now, if the producers had made a biofilm of their lives, including their collaborations with Ted Healy, I think that could have made a great film. Did you know that Larry Fine was a genuinely accomplished violinist? Early in his life he was burned on the arm by spilled acid, so he was made to take violin lessons to strengthen his arm. Did you know that Shemp Howard attempted to extend his range by appearing as a comedic actor or a gangster in a number of non-Stooge films, including CHARLIE CHAN IN RENO?

I might suggest The Three Stooges: The Triumphs and Tragedies of the Most Popular Comedy Team of All Time, by Jeff Forrester and Tom Forrester as a very good expose of all things Stooge, including Ted Healy's relationship with them, and all of the subsequent Stooges that took Curly's and Shemp's place after their deaths.",1344902400,5,1368,4.381889763779528

4864402,5,B005S9EL3K,"What you want in a movie like this is for it to be true to the original Stooges as much as possible. Well that's just what the Farrelly brothers did. The actors look, sound and act like the original stooges (at least as close as one can get anyway). The movie incorporated many of the stooges old gags, which was great! The movie also managed to have the stooges portrayed as if they were still in the 1930's and 40's in their manner and essence. This was no small feat since the movie is set in the present year of 2012. As far as the story goes, I've heard a few complaints (not many). The story is completely adequate and very enjoyable. If you look back at the old stooge shorts you will see that the story lines were simply a series of sight and sound gags with the boys set in different places and sometimes even different time periods. There was very little continuity and plot. And those shorts were only 18 minutes on average. So here with this movie you have to fill up 92 minutes of time and keep it interesting and funny. I think the Farrelly brothers did just that. I laughed my head off throughout the entire movie and that's unusual for me.

Having grown up visiting the local cinema on Saturday mornings, where The Three Stooges were part of the staple diet, I had reasonably high hopes. Added to that, I heard a very favorable interview / review with the one of the directors on NPR, and it sounded like it might be interesting.

Having suffered through the movie last night, the bottom line is that rather than being hilariously funny, it is excruciatingly awful for the most part, with only a couple of laugh out loud slapstick moments (they'e all in the trailer... just watch that).

As for a review of this film:  I've read most of the other reviews.  Come ON, People, it's a tribute to THE THREE STOOGES, a deliberately low-brow slapstick comedy in a contemporary setting by directors who have a long history of this kind of goofy comedy.  What were you expecting?  The Godfather - Part 4?  Raging Bull 2?  Stop reviewing this movie like it had to be anything ELSE.  You're criticizing it like you were disappointed that a Marx Brother's movie wasn't as deep as Citizen Kane.  It's just meant to be a goof-ball comedy, with some modern social satire and parody thrown in, and it succeeds just fine!  The three lead actors obviously worked VERY hard to capture the original Stooge's personas and did a great job.  So just sit back and have some casual, easy laughs for awhile, and if you can't manage to bring yourself to do that, you likely need some mental health counseling and anti-depressents.",1344643200,3,1486,4.579545454545454
4864416,3,B005S9EL3K,"One thing is certain when it comes to the Three Stooges: you either get them or you don't. Those that don't never find the humor that comes from their antics. Those that do are die hard fans who love each and every slap and eye poke. These were the comedies that fueled not just one generation but several. Their short films played in theaters across the country only to later on become a daily staple for the TV generation. But their popularity waned and their recognition factor dropped. All that is about to change with the release of this new film.

The Farrelly brothers, the comedic team behind DUMB AND DUMBER, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and SHALLOW HAL, are major fans of the original Three Stooges. What they've done is attempt to recreate the stooges original form of comedy for a new generation with three new actors in the roles made famous by Moe, Larry and Curly. They succeed on all levels.

The story revolves around three babies dropped off at a Catholic orphanage. As the boys grow they unwittingly terrorize the nuns that run the place. Their antics continually get them into trouble and since they tend to run together they never find a home. When Moe is about to be adopted, he tells his new parents that the best thing would be if they took all three boys. Rather than do that, they take him back and adopt a single child.

As the three grow older they remain at the orphanage, helping out on the property and doing their best to keep things running smoothly. Then again these are the three stooges and anything they touch rarely runs smooth.

The day comes when the church decides they can no longer fund the orphanage. The children are to be slit up into foster care and the nuns placed elsewhere. The boys can't let that happen and go off in search of fame and fortune so that they can save the day. Ill prepared for the world the sisters trust them to at least give it their best shot.

As with the classic stooges' comedies, the three rarely have a clue what is actually going on around them. Seeing them seeking work Lydia (Sofia Vergara) hires them to kill her husband in his sleep explaining he wants to do peacefully. Thinking Mac (Craig Berko), the man with her, is her husband, they accidentally toss him about and land him in the hospital where they try to finish the job. This leads to a hilarious squirt fight using peeing babies in the maternity ward.

Eventually the boys meet an old friend from the orphanage named Teddy. Teddy was the boy adopted over Moe. Now a wealthy lawyer, he tells the boys to get in touch with him. As fate would have it, we later find out that Teddy is the husband of Lydia that she wants taken out. Before we get that far the boys have a falling out and Moe sets out on his own only to wind up in the reality series JERSEY SHORE where he slaps the cast of that show like his brothers. Oh how we wish that were true.

As the plot threads come together the comedy stays with the whole idea until the problems of each character are solved. The film moves along at a brisk pace and the comedy of the situation is mixed well with the slapstick physical comedy that was what the stooges were noted for.

The acting fits the tone and tribute exceptionally well. Chris Diamantopoulos does a great job as Moe, not just in looks but in attitude. Sean Hayes not only looks the part of Larry but sounds just like him as well (his bit with a lobster is hilarious). Will Sasso has always impersonated Curly and he morphs himself into the role with ease here.

The Farrelly brothers have captured the essence of the Stooges and brought them back to life on the big screen once more. Fans will be pleased with the outcome of this film which is not only enjoyable on its own merits but makes you long for the original Stooges films as well. That will be one of the biggest benefits of this film, bringing the originals to the attention of yet another generation. If you never loved the Stooges then you will probably get little from this film. If you did love them, you'll appreciate the tribute paid here. Either way if you're looking for comedy with little depth and plenty of laughs, then make sure you rent this one.",1344470400,4,4171,4.427640156453716
4864417,5,B005S9EL3K,"As an American who has been living in the UK since February 1999, I was fortunate enough to have grown up in Georgia watching The Three Stooges. And thanks to my DVD collection I still do. Therefore, I lamented the fact that the new film would not be released on the big screen in the UK until Friday, the 17th of August, well after the USA theatrical release date of the 13th of April. However, during a recent vacation in Florida, I was amazed and delighted to be able the buy the new film on DVD during the same week it was released. I still can't believe that I was able to sit and watch the film last night in my living room, along with the deleted/extended scenes and the other extras more than a week before it will be shown here in the UK for the very first time. As for the movie itself, it was well-worth the wait. The three leads are nothing short of marvelous as Larry, Moe and Curly. They so captured the whole essence of the original Three Stooges. The Farrelly Brothers are to be commended for (mostly) keeping the comedy clean and suitable for the whole family. I for one would love to see a sequel, if it was of the quality of this film. As for the delayed UK big-screen release, I don't believe that the comedy of The Three Stooges is very well known enough here to be a success. Much in the same way that a lot of British comedy would not be very widely known in the USA. I do feel that The Three Stooges type of comedy doesn't appeal to everyone, but if you are like me and are a devoted fan, you will not be disappointed in this new film.

They nail the mannerisms and vocalizations of the three so completely, it's actually a bit spooky - ghost watching on the same level as Jim Carrey's take on Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon. Problem is, those performances are blown on a tale that's gratingly predictable, horribly misdirected and woefully, thoroughly unfunny. For some unfathomable reason, the troupe is dropped without any modification into the present, where their slapstick Vaudeville act is over-amped and completely out of place. I get that nobody on the planet was clamoring for a reinvention of this particular wheel, but when the script's so desperate for validation it shoehorns in the cast of Jersey Shore for more than just a cameo, maybe it's time to take a step back and reassess. It's a total disaster, not just missing the boat but careening off the pier and plummeting to the bottom of the ocean. If this is the best revival modern Hollywood can come up with for three legends, they should take a long, hard look at their motives before they go about plundering any more graves.",1344211200,6,1219,4.809523809523809

This is genuinely funny, and should be appreciated for what it is: a very well done homage to the Stooges, with some modern touches but still keeping the heart, spirit (and eye pokes) of the originals intact.

The three actors chosen to play the Stooges did a superb job -they didn't mimic or imitate, they became. They owned the characters and did outstanding jobs in allowing the original characters to flow thru them, yet not doing mind-numbing imitations that fans would have seen thru in a minute. Look, this movie is not an effects filled, epic battles & action movie, nor is it ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" -it's the Three Stooges, for crying out loud...

I realize nothing will ever beat the original Stooges; whether it was the Shemp years or the Curly years, they will always be the best -period. This movie is simply paying tribute to the comedy and routines the Stooges are famous for. I also realize there are fans who will not appreciate or like this movie, and you know what?

Happily, the movie is quite fun and recreates the shenanigans quite faithfully.  Chris Diaminotopolous is quite good as Moe--it's almost spooky how much he embodies the mop-headed meanie.  Will Sasso's Curly and Sean Hayes' Larry are also sincere interpretations.  The sight gags are executed in the most complimentary fashion and the plot is merely a roadmap for the Stooges hijinks.  The supporting players are fun, especially Sofia Vergara, Larry David and Craig Bierko.

I saw one negative review suggest that the movie was bad because it had a ""horrible plot."" Another negative review suggested that ""the movie was too predictable."" And a very common criticism here is a reviewer saying something like ""I was never a big fan of The Three Stooges."" To those folks I say: ""What the heck are you doing in front of this movie then?!?""

The Farrelly Brother's have pulled off exactly what they set out to do: Emulate the slapstick comedic entertainment that was originally created over half a century ago by Moe Howard, Curly Howard and Larry Fine.

So this is not a documentary or depiction of the original Three Stooges lives. This is a movie with three excellent imitations of the original guys that act and look almost identical to the original guys that set out on a mission of absolute silliness with no holds barred slapstick as the cornerstone that glues the infrastructure of the film together....And that's what makes the movie great!

Slapstick isn't for everyone.

I indeed was a big Three Stooges fan, and the only reason it took me so long to see this movie was because I was skeptic that any actors other than the original could make funny again in a modern world something that was so uniquely outrageous...not just due to the slapstick, but also due to the individual mannerisms, reactions, idiocy and facial expressions that were such unique signatures of Moe Howard, Curly Howard and Larry Fine.

But the Farrelly Brothers did it, along with brilliant portrayals by Chris Diamantopoulos (Moe), Sean Hayes (Larry) and Will Sasso (Curly)! By remaining true to the simple classic slapstick zaniness that made the original Stooges comedic icons of the mid-20th century, The Three Stooges 2012 had me laughing out loud throughout the entire short 90-minute movie.

Classic Three Stooges fans will be surprised by how reminiscently hilarious this movie ultimately is. Anyone looking for anything more than eye poking, sledgehammer bonking, bell ringing, triple face smacking goofiness should move to the next movie in their queue.",1343692800,,2573,5.205314009661835
4864455,4,B005S9EL3K,"Let's get one thing straight. No one can replace the THREE STOOGES. They were a one of a kind act that will never be equaled, yet there is something funny about THE THREE STOOGES MOVIE that is a nice homage to times past.
I attended a THREE STOOGES film festival last Novemeber and Peter Farrelly spoke to the audience about his upcoming THREE STOOGES FILM. He promised that they had stuck to the stooges legacy as much as possible. Unfortunately, I had low expectations and was not convinced. I decided not to see the film in the theaters and hesitantly waited for the DVD.
My expectations were low so I think that influenced me greatly when the film was better than I expected. It is far from a real THREE STOOGES film but enough effort was made to bring their essence to the screen that I found myself laughing on a number of occasions--maybe it was simply a routine that reminded me of the actual stooges.
This is far from a great movie. The Farrelly brothers should have done better but there is enough ""nyuck nyuck nyucks"" to make this a funny film.
It is always great to see the lovely Sofia Vergara and this time she is the villain trying to hire the stooges to kill her husband. As can be guessed, nothing goes as planned. Jane Lynch is fun as a nun trying to hold an orphanage together. Lovely Jennifer Hudson is under-used as another nun. Larry David plays a crotchedly nun who has no time for or love of the stooges. There was a stroke of genius having Larry David as a nun!
Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes, and Will Sasso all do their best to look and act like the original Moe, Larry and Curly. They do a good job with their routines and gags in a less than inspired script.
No one can replace the Stooges. No one can deny that. The Farrelly brothers made a decent yet flawed attempt to bring these classic characters back to live. There are a lot of laughs in this film and a good choice if you want something funny and mindless.",1343606400,,1945,4.375690607734807

I am not sure what people who trashed the movie were expecting.  I suspect many of them did not like the original Stooges either.  These guys do a great job of re-enacting their mannerisms and gags.

Now we're ordering the DVD since this is one movie you can laugh at over and over.

All three actors played the original characters of Moe, Larry and Curly
with great tribute and fine imitation of the original 3 stooges.

4864460,4,B005S9EL3K,"I grew up watching Moe, Larry, Curly, and Shemp, so I was more than a little skeptical when I heard about the Farrelly brothers remake (if you can call it a remake). I only saw the movie advertise on television once when it was at theaters and it did not look too good. Then I read a few bad reviews about the movie, making me less likely to go see it. The movie did not do very well at the theaters, barely covering its budget worldwide. I saw the DVD for under fifteen dollars and I talked myself into buying it.

The movie opens up with the same Stooges' tune and similar opening credits. The first episode is titled ""More Orphan Than Not,"" which explains the Stooges back-story, where as babies they are left in basket outside of an orphanage. As they grow up and cause chaos for the nuns (played by Jane Lynch, Larry David, and a few others), Moe is almost adopted by a wealthy couple, but they end up adopting another orphan, Teddy, instead. Twenty-five years later, Moe (played by Chris Diamantopoulos), Larry (played by Sean Hayes), and Curly (Will Sasso) have never left the orphanage as they are now handymen, but the home that they have known is going to be closed down as the orphanage owes $830,000 in thirty days.

There are two more episodes in the movie, ""The Bananas Splits"" and ""No Moe Mister Nice Guy,"" in which the trio go to the big city to raise the money. Since they have been sheltered, they have no clue what to do, but luck happens to be on their side as a mysterious woman offers them the money, but they have to kill her dying husband. After being chased out of the hospital, they briefly run into Teddy. The Stooges are still broke but come up with a Salmon Farm idea, which turns into a disaster.

With time running out, Larry and Curly leave Moe, hoping to raise the money on their own. Then Moe accidentally gets a role on a reality series, The Jersey Shore. While looking for Teddy, so they can ask him for money, Larry and Curly stumble onto a murder plot.

I am surprised that the movie was rated PG considering that the Farrelly brothers directed it, and I am glad that did not try to raunch up the Stooges, but instead they used the old slapstick humor that the Stooges are famous for using. No one can every replace the original Stooges, but I was shocked at how well the actors stepped into the Stooges feet mimicking their voices and actions, especially Will Sasso who played Curly. The plot is simple and at times, the script feels silly, but was not that the point of the old Stooges' shorts, silliness. Even though I do prefer the originals, I did find myself laughing at the new Stooges. It is not a great film, but its fun to watch.",1343347200,,2677,4.380281690140845

4864462,5,B005S9EL3K,"You would think that it would be a relatively easy matter to remake a classic or make a new film in a classic genre. But it ain't so. Look at The Artist. Did those people never see a silent film? Did they ever sit down and decide what they were making, a silent film in the old style - or a film about making silent films - or a romance set in silent film days. In the end, they produced neither very well. (You can get an Oscar any day, just by making a film about film. The SAG members are such narcissists.)

But these guys ARE the Stooges. I am just knocked out that they captured so many nuances of Stoogish behavior. Curly's little skip and wiggle when he exits, for instance. I would not have bet even a small sum that, even had the actors sealed themselves away for months with every Stooge film ever made and practiced that they would nail the boys to a tee. Even the final exit was classic Stooges. In short, this is what you wish for, when you wish for another Three Stooges film.",1343260800,,991,4.161458333333333

The scene was harmless and funny but sadly the Studio caved to pressure and cut it.  On the Blu-ray extras there is a distant shot of Kate acting as a pool life guard but not the close-up emerging from the pool the trailer promised.  If you love Kate Upton like me, you'll be disappointed.",1343174400,2,529,4.27
4864465,5,B005S9EL3K,"Overall, the movie was a blast.  I'm a huge Three Stooges fan, having watched probably just about every single one of their ""shorts,"" or episodes if you will.  There's just something about their slapstick comedy routines that are always funny to me.

First off, I want to say the actors did a fantastic job channeling the original Stooges.  From the voices down to the motions and mannerisms, they really did their homework.  So much so, that I hope they work together again in the future, because they seemed to have great chemistry together, and judging by the special features of the Blu-ray version, they had a lot of fun as well.

As was stated in the behind the scenes extra feature, this movie was made as a tribute, paying homage to the original Stooges, as well as to hopefully let today's younger generation, or anyone who has not seen or heard of the Three Stooges, get a taste of what they were all about.  Maybe even get them to go back and watch the original Stooges' classics.

I do not know what people were expecting when they saw this movie for the first time.  For everyone giving it bad reviews, seriously, what were you expecting the movie to be? I'll admit, some of the plot was lacking, and there were a few bits that seemed over the top or overdone, but overall, it was an amazing and pretty much non-stop laugh-fest.  I like to think of it in the same vein as a tribute band.  Of course it's not going to be an exact clone or replica.  The band members or actors are not going to look, act, or play exactly like the original cast.  But you're going to their concert to hear the music you loved from way back when.  And in that sense, this movie was the best tribute song to the Three Stooges I've ever seen(or heard).",1343174400,3,1742,4.403125
4864466,1,B005S9EL3K,"I felt like I was setup for disappointment.  I was skeptical of this movie, and I didn't not go to watch it in theaters.  However, after reading many of the reviews here, I decided to watch it anyways.  The stooges did not age well, and the story line was rather weak.  This movie could have been much much better if it was just a remake of a series of the old episodes.  While it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's definitely a waste of time.  The original stooges we're dumb.  These stooges we're just stupid.  For those concerned about raunchiness, there is no worry.  Kate Upton was in the entire movie for maybe 3 minutes at best(There's more bikini in the trailer than the actual movie).  However, some scenes, especially the baby one, was just too nasty to be funny.  Good actors, for the most part.  It had potential.  But the poor writing, Jersey Shore, and stupid plot was just too much to overcome

Pros;
- It was short

Cons;
- Poor writing
- Horrible Plot
- Not enough Kate Upton

My wife was not a stooge fan and could barely stand to be in the room.  I'm a pretty big stooge fan, and I wish I wasn't in the room either.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT overall.",1343174400,6,1171,4.317972350230415
4864467,5,B005S9EL3K,"When the trailers for this film first came out, everyone I knew had the same thing to say, ""It looks awful.""

I was dumbfounded. As a lifelong fan of The Stooges, I thought the trailers looked dead on. There was slapstick, mugging, cringe-worthy puns, and ludicrous situations. ""What are you expecting?"" I told everyone. ""Dry wit and urbane satire?""

No. Look. If you love the Stooges, then you should know what to expect, and in that sense, the movie delivers. Sasso, Hayes, and Dia, Dima, Dena... whatever his name is. They all perform their characters flawlessly. Even the children that play the toddler Stooges were astonishingly good at mimicking both the look, sound, and movement of the original triad of twits. Really, when it comes down to a Stooge remake, the only questions you've gotta ask are a) do they do justice to the Stooges and b) do they keep it up for a whole movie's length? The answers are yes and yes. If you want complex jokes, subtlety, or depth, then you must not know who the Three Stooges are.

In addition to providing spot-on recreations of those lovable lunkheads, the film judiciously includes nearly pitch-perfect, bonk-for-bonk remakes of iconic Stooge scenes and jokes mixed with material updated for contemporary culture. Larry David, Sofia Vergara, Jane Lynch, and other tested comedic actors/actresses hold their own as the straight men and women to the Stooges' pummeling punnery, and the story refuses to veer from the tried-and-true Stooge formula, with our goofuses setting out into the real world to save an orphanage one eye poke at a time (the back story for how the nun-run kid's home went broke is a delightful self-gibing surprise).

My only real complaint with the film has to do with the addition of the cast of The Jersey Shore. The Stooges try a number of methods to raise the dough for the orphanage, and one of them involves joining the famed reality show. I guess this might satisfy many viewers' wishes to watch these buff and belligerent ""guidos"" and ""guidettes"" get a taste of the old Stooge medicine (which involves, of course, cartoon-style violence), but it threw me out of the film. First of all, none of those Jersey-ites can act to save their lives. Second, it adds the pall of realism (even if briefly) to what is otherwise the traditionally ludicrous level of Stooge capering. One of the Jersey-ites is smacked across the face and he cries out, ""You can't do that! That's assault!"" Then more slaps, pokes, and scrapes are administered, and this quick attempt to place the Stooges within the realm of reality quickly fades away.

Given how well-executed the actual Stooge-foolery is, this is a small bump in an otherwise pitch perfect film (so brimming, by the way, with jokes, homages, and asides that it would take multiple viewings to catch them all). If you sat down and watched an original Stooge film and then sat down to watch this, you'd probably have the same reaction to both. Either love it or hate it, this film is a respectful nod by the slapstick-lovin' Farrelly brothers to those older brothers (plus Fine) who perfected the art of slapstick in the first place.",1343174400,3,3142,4.821892393320964

4864470,4,B005S9EL3K,"I was skeptical going into this but I was pleasantly surprised.  This is purely a fun movie and beyond silly.  I have to say the three actors playing the Stooges captured the essence of the original guys.  The slapstick was very good.  The sound effects were right on the mark.  The absurdity of it all was just great.  I laughed out-loud at a number of the scenes.  The caricatures of the nuns and other ordinary citizens was priceless.  And, of course, you have to have one poor S.O.B. that cannot help but get continually injured by the side effects of the Stooges' actions.

I had to laugh at the end when the producers came on a gave a disclaimer that kiddies shouldn't do these antics at home.  I suppose today you would need such a disclaimer.  Of course, when we were kids and tried some of that, our mother would snap back, ""Well, if they jumped off a cliff, I suppose you would, too!??!""  But, I suppose kids today are not familiar with slapstick as most movies show people getting lasered or beamed to death and without those items actually existing, I suppose they pose little real threat.

On the other hand, dad probably does have a sledge hammer out in the garage.  Perhaps, the warning is a good idea.

Really, it is a fun movie and every guy I know would find it hilarious.  I don't think women generally like the Stooges.  The old story goes that you could take 50 guys ranging from 18 to 80, total strangers, don't even speak the same language, put them in a big room with a large screen projection TV, a keg of beer, and some munchies.

Literally hysterical and the perfect introduction for my kids who have never seen the Three Stooges.  Larry, Moe and Curly are back and funnier than ever. Played magnificently by Larry (Sean Hayes), Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos), & Curly (Will Sasso) we laughed in almost every scene and if we weren't laughing we were oofing and oohing. The Three Stooges slapstick comedy is perfect for the whole family.

Sean Hayes as Larry is great. These guys really learned their roles and were in fact, the Three Stooges. With a lot of the same noises, hand gestures and comedy falls as the originals mixed with some currentness like the Jersey Shore cast and woman trying to off their husbands you and your kids will love this!

Making a a trio like the Three Stooges and their humor current, isn't an easy task but the The Farrelly Bros do a great job even adding a few minutes at the end letting kids know that all the gags are fake and showing them that the guys hit each other with rubber mallets and axes and how they shouldn't try any of this at home. Pretty responsible considering the humor and the fact that this is a family movie. There is some violence for a family movie but it is all very slapstick and cartoonish.

Lots of physical comedy, lots of the 1940's type insults (such as ""hey chowderhead""), and it even had a good story too. Or am I getting the movie mixed up with the originals? If I am, that is a GOOD THING because it held true to its roots. That is all the movie had to do. In fact, the movie was sub-divided into three 30 minute segments further strengthening the connection to the originals.

I have been since I was a kid and watched the reruns of their shorts on TV until now. I, unlike some, enjoy Shemp, Joe Besser and Curley Joe as well. Most of the 190 shorts are very good to incredible. Some of the movies were pretty good and some just alright. Now flash forward to 2012. I believe the 3 guys doing the roles did a great job. Some of the facial expressions of the Moe character are great and definitely honor Moe Howard. The other 2 are incredible as well. The main reason I only give the movie 3 stars is personally I think the script is a little weak. My wife and I went to the theater to see the movie, because I had to see it and she was curious. I actually thought the ""Her face rang a bell"" part was funny. The babies urinating scene went on much longer than was needed. When we saw the movie, during the part with the dolphin scene everyone around us was howling with laughter, I guess neither of us got it. Bottom line: Are you a 3 Stooges fan?

4864527,4,B005S9EL3K,Unlike the Amazing Spider-man the Farrelly Brothers at least waited for over 50 years before making another Three Stooges movie.  People thought that it was a crime to make this movie in that no one could replace the Stooges. They weren't trying to do that.  This made a love letter to the Stooges and it succeeded on that basis.  I liked that it put the Stooges in the modern world but somehow kept them in a timeless bubble in their reactions to the outside world.  I am curious to see what is on the blu-ray.  The one fault I find is the casting of the Jersey Shore idiots as the Jersey Shore idiots.  I think they could have created a fake show and did the same thing without having to give them more money or exposure. Even only they really poked them in the eyes.  Kudos for the fake violence disclaimer at the end.  The smack-fest in the theater was like a ballet!,1342051200,2,871,4.300613496932515

4864529,1,B005S9EL3K,"...only not as pleasant!

 Imagine the movie Ishtar and combine it with Leonard Part 6. Now tack on The Super Mario Bros. Movie,mix with Freddy Got Fingered and add a heaping helping of Jaws:The Revenge, Joe Versus The Volcano and The Garbage Pail Kids. Think that would be a piece of crap? Just wait until you take a whiff of this cinematic turd.

 I honestly don't know what Hollywood AKA Shallowwood is thinking anymore when it comes to crediting the average schmoe off the street with common sense.

 First off,I'm not writing this review because I am a ""stooge-hater"" ""anti-stooge"" or think that slapstick is stupid. Quite the contrary,I grew up in the 80s and every saturday night as a kid from 10:30 at night to 1 a.m. the stooges were on channel 11. Fastforward to 2012 and we get this mess...

 1.)The stooges never emplemented ""toilet humor""--whenever I watched the trio on tv,they never farted or talked about ""boogers.""

 2.)The stooges were always about yukking it up at the cost of their own selves;they never bashed a religon and they did not promote an ideology--unless you want to count Moe Howard's take on Hitler during war time,in which case you would be defending Nazisim,in which case you would be an idiot.

 Oh yeah! What a great family movie to bring the kiddies too! Ha! Ha!Ha! A nun takes a churchbell to the head! Ha! Ha!Ha! A nun gets a stooge poke to the eyes! Ha! Ha!Ha! First off this is really dumb,because all three stooges were Jewish. Secondly whenever there was a ""save the poor orphanage from the mean ol' tax collector"" scenario,it was never tied into a religous background. This was just a disrespectful act promoted by yet another anti-Christian/anti-Catholic lemming from Hollyweird.

 Imagine how the Muslim community would have reacted if Alah took a poke in the eyes by Moe,or if Muhammad took a few jabs from Larry? The three actors who played the three stooges would have become the three dead bodies.

3.) This is Blues Brothers 2000 and The New Pink Panther all over again. John Goodman could not replace John Belushi,Steve Martin could not fill the shoes of Peter Sellers and Wingus,Dingus and FruitLoops (don't know the actual names of these ""actors"" and I don't care either) couldn't even come close to breathing life back into the old hollywood legends. How many failures does it take these film producers to learn that once the greats are gone,they cannot be reanimated--and certainly not when a new brand of ""humor"" is shackled around that persona's ankles.

If you want to introduce your kids to the comic stylings of the stooges,then show them THE REAL THING and pass on this 2012 mutilation. More fun and alot less crude garbage and militant propoganda. Oh,and I'm pretty sure Curly never tried to perform Heimlich on a dolphin....",1341964800,14,2789,4.803347280334728

I understand where people are coming from and know that the real Three Stooges are all passed now even the last few semi clones for Curly, so yes they are not the real Three Stooges.  The actors that play them in the movie I thought did a great job much better than the ""other"" three would have been able to do, now not saying that the others are bad actors but just not right for these roles.  As for the stunts and gags that were done in the movie yes they were for the most part how they were done from the old days and maybe that is why people feel they were repetitive, if they tried something new then the fans would have cried noooo that's not what they do because they never did that before. The story might have needed something but over all if you did not go in to watch the movie with the mindset of wanting to tear it apart because you think you're the biggest Stooge fan, or thinking how did my boyfriend trick me into seeing this film, you would have seen that the movie did what it should have and was entertaining.  I am sure I am not the first to say this but I feel that with the actors that were used (all three did a swell job some captured the person they were playing better than others) this could have been the new restart of the new Three Stooges back to TV.

No over acting no under acting, JUST RIGHT.

I know ALL Stooges fans will love this film and people who may not know of the Stooges will love it too.  It has a wonderful story and a moral message too.

4864532,3,B005S9EL3K,"I am a Stooges fan.  I was aghast when I heard about this project but then, after seeing the previews, I was cautiously optimistic.  If only the Farrellys had not tried to shoehorn their patented bodily function gags into the script.  They rationalized it in interviews by saying that, if the Stooges were around in today's more permissive cultural landscape, they would be indulging in the same kinds of gross-out gags.  This is a huge miscalculation.  A scene in a maternity ward is clearly meant to be an updating of old seltzer water gags but it just doesn't work the same way.  I appreciate a well executed, raunchy gag but they really do not have a place in this universe.  However, it is clear that Peter & Bobby have tremendous affection for the trio and the whole film clearly means so well that it's a bit difficult to rag on it too harshly.  But, I can't say I laughed all that much.  Maybe I chuckled here and there.  The actors all do a tremendous job.  Chris Diamantopoulos practically becomes Moe Howard.  I was most skeptical of Sean Hayes' Larry Fine, especially in the wake of Billy West's uncanny impersonation.  But he, by no means, embarrasses himself.  All the supporting actors are into the spirit of the thing but the directors just make a handful of wrong turns (i.e., the gross-out stuff, the Jersey Shore detour which will horribly date the film, the dumb prologue with the young Stooges, the awful choice of background music that undermines some solid slapstick sequences) that doom the film to failure.  Though, with one or two adjustments, a follow up film might prove to be more successful than the first.  Or maybe just as lousy.  The deleted scenes on the DVD (which are funny) indicate that there was more, possibly better, slapstick that was inexplicably excised from the film.  Why they chopped it in favor of the cliched plotline remains a mystery to me.  They really tried here but it just left me cold, personally.  Perhaps I wanted to like it too much.  It clearly works for other people (you'll note other glowing reviews) and I can appreciate that.  And, if it succeeds in turning a new generation on to the REAL Stooges, I ultimately guess it's okay in my book.",1341446400,9,2204,4.655440414507772

I have to say that the casting was perfect. All three looked and acted like the original stooges. The big difference is that the original guys were funny. In the last year there have been some awful comedies. Ones that come to mind are ""Bucky Larson"" and ""Jack And Jill"". I did find a few parts of those movies funny and laughed a few times.

4864563,4,B005S9EL3K,"When hearing about the making of this movie, I had mixed feelings. You see, my father is a huge Stooge fan and owns about every episode of the three bone heads. While I usually take my mom's side of the entertainment boat, I have always found myself enjoying the Stooges. It's more than just smacks and puns. It's the characters, their history, and their ability to make you laugh.

So when this movie came out, I was worried. Hollywood has a tendency to.....how do I put this.....slaughter TV history's most lovable characters. And when the trailer was realized I was also a little worried because of the dreaded and unneeded ""bikini nun"" scene.

But during the time of the release my father was very stressed. You see, he is a pastor and a police officer. Both jobs don't really fall under the ""fun"" category. Some things popped up at the church and county work was starting to get to him. So I thought it might be good for us to wing a visit to the local theater and take in an hour and a half of the Stooges.

Grabbed my popcorn, sat down, and my fingers were crossed....Either this movie would do justice or ruin the Stooges for everyone.....and before I could even finish my first handful of popcorn I started choking on it....from laughter....

Another fact you may want to know is that my father doesn't laugh much. He's got a gift for making people laugh and he's got an amazing sense of humor. But, he doesn't laugh that much. Well, as soon as the movie started that all changed. I have never, repeat, never heard him laugh so much. This movie left you with a huge smile on your face. They did the Stooges, they weren't just doing them, they WERE the stooges. The quirks, the gags, and the ""NUKS"" were all there.

It took me a full day to get rid of that stupid smile I had on, but that didn't stop me from seeing it again (mom dodged it the first time, but the second my dad MADE her see it). He now calls it his ""Favorite movie"".

I'm a pushover for movie with good writing....and that's not really what I saw here, there were more slaps than words. But to see the Stooges after all these years come to life again, that was priceless. Would I recommend this movie? That depends. If you loved the Stooges, you need to see this film. If you didn't, then don't torture yourself. But again, for those people who know them, and enjoy them.

Then I went to IMDB.com and my heart dropped. Three guys recreating the Stooges? With the cast of the Jersey Shore? I swore never to see it. In fact, I was thinking some form of Inquisitional type punishment should be done to the mental cases who wanted to do it!
Then I saw the trailer. And watched it again and again and again. just seeing Snooki get eye poked sold me. But the movie itself was so damn funny, such an excellent homage to the original three, that I laughed from beginning to end. No lie, I was laughing when the movie opened and the Stooges theme was played. Ok, it isn't rocket science, nor will it rend one's heart. But what the Three Stooges will do is make one laugh. And laugh. And laugh. Will Sasso, Sean Hayes and Chris D. (I'm not spelling that!) were perfect as the Stooges. A few gags were updated, Chainsaw on a ladder instead of a regular saw, but all was done with such love for the original Trio that any fan of this has to be happy with it.

To make matters worse, many attempts have been made to pay tribute to the Stooges over the past 50 years and basically all of those attempts have been done by (no offense) the comically retarded.

This time around the story falls into the hands of The Farrelly brothers, and they handle with care. A story that drives along quickly, slapping you in the face with joke after joke, the way the real Stooges always intended. No sloppy overuse of catchphrases like 'nyuck nyuck nyuck' or 'soitanly' ...theres just enough of that. The script is full of fresh and sharp dialougue, just as the classic Stooges were written. The plot involving the orphanage I believe was lifted from the 1989 Nintendo game but it works well anyway.

Imagine my shock when I read the supposedly authoritative ""Amazon.com Editorial Review"" posted at the film's page with the reviewer saying it was the Farrellys' ""weakest effort to date"" and ""terminally unfunny.""  Look, I'm smart enough to know one review is just one person's opinion, and that comedy is very personal and a heckuva lot harder to pull off than drama (what's funny to one person is often simply irritating or annoying to another), but when the review is posted on a film's page as the authoritative last word, I have to put my two-cents in.  Here's my short review:  I either smiled, chuckled, or laughed out loud through the ENTIRE running time of this film, and that very rarely happens for me, hence my 5-star rating.  Most comedies, even the best, have slow spots you wait out until the next laugh--it's often the natural flow of a film to have peaks and valleys, but this film had none for me--it was all peaks.  Every scene had something for me to at least smile at, whether it was the Stooges themselves, Jane Lynch as a Mother Superior (!), Larry David as a cranky nun (!), Lin Shaye showing up out of the blue in a small role (I love her), Sofia Vergara gamely sparring with the guys, or small touches, surprises, and sight gags that flew by so fast you knew you'd be laughing all over again when you saw it a second time (if we'd had the time we would've gladly stayed to watch it a second time the day we saw it--the friend I saw it with had as much fun watching it as I did).  The three leads were perfectly cast, and if you know the Stooges, you'll appreciate even more how perfect they are.  It's uncanny how close they are to the originals, and the entire production feels like a respectful and loving homage to them.  There is no doubt in my mind the film will spark even more appreciation and discovery of the original Stooges and their huge body of work, and that's exactly what you hope for:  that the new film not only succeeds on its own but sparks viewers' interest, appreciation, and respect for the originals.",1336176000,200,2377,4.456221198156682

I did get a little mad seeing Jersey Shore but seeing Moe beat them up made me happy. Is it bad? I've been a life long Stooge fan and no one can replace the original stooges but this is a good tribute to the boys. Very funny but does have a few moments where it drags a bit.

The slapstick humor hasn't changed a bit, and the modern actors channel the originals with decent fidelity. It's almost as if the stooges were frozen in time, while the world moved on around them.

The childhood years I watched the stooges were lots closer to the stooges' early movies (ca 1930) than to the present day. So, two things have aged in the handful of decades since: my own view of the stooges, and the stooge humor itself. Their inane slapstick no longer has the fascination for me it had when I was eight, and eighty years of movie-making largely left them behind. Although this homage appears to serve the purpose it meant to, bringing the three back to life, I'm not sure that most people (me included) really needed that.

While all the actors pull their weight in THE THREE STOOGES, Will Sasso as Curly - the star of the original act - comes more than prepared enough for his role.  Sure, he does not look a heck of a lot like Curly Howard, but he gets you laughing almost as hard.

4864593,4,B005S9EL3K,"I grew up a fan of the Stooges. I will acknowledge that they can only be imitated and never duplicate, especially Curly. While I didn't want to enjoy this film, I found myself laughing in the beginning at the first gag when an infant's stooge fingers came out of a sack and ""doinked"" the nun in the eyes. The young stooges were also a treat as they were able to imitate the famous gags and lines. One had to have some familiarity with the Stooges to catch the humor such as when they tried to revive a nun by gently slapping her (Larry David) on the face and saying ""Say a few parables"" instead of their normal ""Say a few syllables"" line. Yes, I thought that was funny. I also enjoyed the the way they used their titles and sign names as puns the way the original Stooges did in their famous lawyers ""Dewey Cheatam, and Howe"" now used in ""Car Talk"" gag credits.

There were scenes that worked and some that didn't work. Sean Hayes as Larry was the weakest of the three, perhaps because his head was too thin. There were some lines that they missed. Instead of ""Where are your manners?"" they should have used ""Where's your Emily Post."" When Curly spins around on the floor, that needs to be sped up slightly. It doesn't work in real time. The big to-do about Kate Upton in a hot nun's swim suit last about 3 seconds near the end of the film. If you are not a serious Stooge fan, you should wait for the rental.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1335052800,2,1438,4.263736263736264
4864624,5,B005S9EL3K,"How did they do it? How did they manage to revive the Three Stooges in such a flawless fashion? They even divided the movie into 3 episodes (Which all follow the same plot, but still!), making it like as if they had created new episodes of the classic slapstick comedy! Believe it or not, this movie fits right into the days of old!

While the plot may have a bit of seriousness involved (The Stooges are trying to save an orphanage where they had spent time there due to them never being adopted as kids - And there's sorta more to it, such as attempted murder), it was easily overshadowed by numerous comedy bits (Which come around just as often as in the original show), tons of clever moments, and even the casting alone (The Stooges look EXACTLY like how they were back then, and I didn't think it'd be possible!)!

There is so much to like about the Three Stooges movie that it's impossible to tell it all under this one little review. I recommend you go watch the trailers online. Or better yet, you may as well just go watch the movie right now! You will NOT be disappointed! My little brother, my dad, and I went to go see it just today. We each had enjoyed it GREATLY. I hope you will enjoy this movie as much as we did (And maybe you'd get the same kind of nostalgia my dad did).",1334966400,16,1290,4.261224489795918
4864625,4,B005S9EL3K,"I am so sick and tired of hearing every little whiney cry baby saying the intended cast of Jim Carrey, Sean Penn, and Bennie of The Bull would have somehow made the movie better than the guys they used in the movie. I'm glad the first choices walked away. It would have totally sucked. The ones who wound up doing the movie were about as perfect as you can get. The strong point of the movie was definitely their performance. The basic premise of the movie was only weakened by the outstanding portrayals of the main characters. I have to admit though most of the laughs for me came during the first half of the movie. I would say if you're a fan of the actual Three Stooges then you should at least admire the effort they put into recreating the personalities and likenesses of Moe, Larry, and Curly. I myself am looking forward to a sequel. One with a haunted house, racketeers, gun molls, and someone who will have a typical 1940s cheap line like, ""Listen toots if ya boyfriend hea doesn't start makin like a canary one of yous is gonna get it right between the eyes"" Ooooh! and a little pie fight too. If you saw this movie and didn't like it, that's cool. It does have things about it I wasn't that crazy about, but I still think there is a lot more to like about it than there is not to like. So lower your snobbery, widen your heart and take a chance on The Three Stooges movie.",1334880000,7,1385,4.269961977186312
4864626,5,B005S9EL3K,"A bow to the Farrelly brothers.  They didn't try to revamp the Stooges for the 2lst century or modernize their lunkheadedness.  They asked for and got actors and performances which uncannily resemble the original Moe, Curly, and Larry in speech, movement, and gags.  Close your eyes and you could hear the originals; open them and you'd still be surprised at how closely the two trios look alike (although Will Sasso as Curly is a lot bigger than his pals).  Contrary to the real stooges who were moaning in the real world about the gall of making a new Stooge show, this Stooge effort does honor to the original Stooges and brings their hijinks to life again.

Even Joan Howard Maurer, Moe Howard's daughter, thought the new Stooges ""had the moves down,"" and at times ""thought she caught a glimpse of her dad.""  The movie cuts both ways: if you loved the first stooges you'll enjoy this movie; if you didn't love them, this movie will likely leave you as bewildered as before.  I grew up on the Stooges and have always been a fan, even to the point of buying and reading Moe Howard's biography of the group.

This movie is funny.  It starts a little slowly with the Stooges growing up in the orphanage but quickly builds up comedic steam.  They leave the orphanage to try to raise money enough to keep it open, not realizing until later why the institution was in such deep financial water.  They get finagled into being the stooges for a knock-your-eyes-out Sofia Vergara, playing Lydia who wants to off her husband.  Along the way there's the mandatory crisis and split preceded by the most hilarious non-stop eye-poke, face-slap Stoogery ever.

Moe makes it to ""The Jersey Shore"" show as part of the ensemble.  Dunderheads whined when they saw Moe eye-poke Snooky on the trailers, not realizing that (a) he was doing it to Snooky--how great is that? and (b) he proceeds to stooge-slap, head-konk, and otherwise clobber the rest of the cast.  If Moe's turn on Jersey Shore doesn't make you laugh, then your sense of humor got thrown out with yesterday's trash.

My wife doesn't like the Stooges and finds her male relatives' worshipping of Moe, Curly, and Larry inexplicable.  But she burst out laughing until gasping several times in the movie (to my surprise).  The baby pee-pee scene was far funnier than it sounds, and she laughed until nearly breathless.  (Maybe memories of our first son repeatedly peeing on my shirts because his diaper didn't fit well over his umbilical stub came to mind.)

This Farrelly effort far outshines in comedy the old Three Stooges' feature length films (which admittedly lacked either Curly or Shemp, the latter quite funny in his own right).  It's as funny as all but two or three of the greatest shorts the Stooges made, and that's saying something.  This movie is a rarity--one that is almost uniformly funny from end to end.  (Don't forget the punning in the printed names on door windows.)  We now have a worthy addition to the Stooges' work, and I'm grateful to the Farrellys.  If they can keep their near-perfect pitch, tone and of course comedy going, here's to the brothers making more Three Stooges movies yet.",1334793600,4,3159,4.741758241758242
4864627,2,B005S9EL3K,"I don't have too much to say about the movie.  The plot was very simplistic.  There were a bunch of funny moments, but most of the slapstick made me cringe with embarrassment as to why I was watching this.  The actors did an amazing job of capturing the spirit of the 3 Stooges; however, the forced jokes, bland dialogue, and Jersey Shore antics ruin the experience.  They would have been better off making 3 mini movies with different plots instead of one.",1334707200,4,457,4.536585365853658

I had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard.  I may be somewhat persuaded, since I have always been a stooges fan.  If you like silly, funny stuff, then check out the three stooges.

4864630,4,B005S9EL3K,"Some good comedy here but let's be very clear that it is not as funny as the original comedies. The idea to update the Stooges to modern day situations has been kicking around for spme years now. It's a long overdue idea but the execution is uneven at times.
Of the 3 leads, Hayes as Larry probably does the best with his role and this is a pleasant surprise. The other 2 leads are fairly good but not excellent. A really good supporting cast adds to the movie's charms. Very enjoyable but just not as good as it could have been. Maybe a better script and actors with the great talent and range to play Moe and Curly would have been better but as is, it is still fun and humorous. A great idea but only good execution.",1334361600,,718,4.2101449275362315
4864631,5,B005S9EL3K,"Well done!!!  A clean (yet violent) movie, with constant laughs for most of the movie.  I have to admit that this is not for everyone, and is much better appreciated by fans of the classic film shorts.  It has no profanity, no inappropriate sexual references, and it even has a disclaimer at the end!  It also has some great inside jokes for adults.  I laughed my head off, especially when Curly pulled the guy's droopy pants up for him.  Hilarious!",1334361600,2,449,4.55
4864632,5,B005S9EL3K,"The Three Stooges started out as short subject films before a feature film, and it's good to see The Three Stooges back on a theater screen.

""The Three Stooges"" doesn't have an involved plot or great subtle nuanced acting, it doesn't need it. The plot is pretty basic, the stooges are dropped off at an orphanage some time in the late 70's and as they grow up they wreak havoc on the nuns running the place and of course they're unadoptable. After they grow up Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos), Larry (Sean Hayes), and Curly (Will Sasso) still live at the orphanage and wirk as handymen. Yes, I spelled it wirk because they aren't the brightest bulbs in the socket although they may stick their fingers in the socket! When the orphanage runs into financial problems the boys are sent out into the world to raise $830,000 to save it (shades of the Blues Brothers). Out in the world they're instantly picked by Lydia (Sofia Vergara) and Mac (Craig Bierko) planning to murder Lydia's husband. They give the trio a song and dance of wanting the stooges to kill Mac, but the story is a ruse to get the stooges to kill her husband. In all their bumbling good intentions to collect the $830,000 they foul up the murder plot, and provoke the ire of the murdering couple. All standard stooge fare.

There are a lot of good actors and actresses in ""The Three Stooges"", Jane Lynch, Brian Doyle Murray, Larry David, Stephen Collins, Sofia Vergara, but Diamantopoulos, Hayes, and Sasso are rightly front and center as the stooges and they do just about every classic stooge bit including a few new ones. And the usual foils of cops, doctors, lawyers, and high society matrons are the brunt of the stooges antics. A note, Moe becomes a reality star on Jersey Shore and its worth the price of admission to watch him dole out some well deserved punishment to the Shore cast.

The movie is episodic to recreate the feel of the original stooge shorts and directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly realize less is more and don't try to make this movie anything more than it is, good popcorn munching fun! Yes, it is violent, but some of the routines seem more intricate than dance routines and the violence is very cartoonish. If there are some of you out there that still aren't convinced, there's a postscript demonstrating how all the hammers are rubber, and how the eye poking is faked.

There are chick flicks and ""The Three Stooges"" may be a dude flick. I'm not a huge Stooges fan but the movie made me laugh and it was a lot of fun.",1334275200,69,2508,4.554323725055433
4864633,1,B005S9EL3K,"Oh, what might have been. The Three Stooges has had a wild ride towards the silver screen, with many big names having been attached or approaching playing the iconic trio of morons from yesteryear.  At one point, Sean Penn, Jim Carrey, and Benicio Del Toro were all but set to be a part of the Farrelly Brothers' film, but each saw the writing on the wall and ran for the hills. That's a trio that could make any piece of crap script at the very least workable, and any terrible movie watchable. Without them, though, The Three Stooges is a fail of epic proportions, and not even the most die hard aficionado is going to appreciate this level of damage done to their comedy heroes.

 It's clear what the Farrellys were thinking, hoping that they could recapture the magic of  Dumber and Dumber and slap a more recognizable name on it. Their Stooges, played by Sean Hayes, Chris Diamantopolous, and Will Sasso, are just more violent versions of Harry and Lloyd. The major difference is in the substance of the characters, and while Dumb and Dumber wasn't exactly a tour de force, there was enough in it to sustain an entire full length feature. The Three Stooges, throughout their careers, have only done skits or shorts. Watching somebody get hit in the head with a mallet is great fun....for about five minutes. After about the tenth time of watching it you'll be ready to poke yourself in the eyes and shove lobsters down your own pants.

Cleverly structured like a series of Stooges episodes, the trio are literally thrown on the doorstep of an orphanage as babies, and pay attention closely because these are the only times where a decent laugh can be found and they have nothing to do with the three stars. Larry David and Jane Lynch make up two of the nuns at who run the place, and you haven't lived until you've seen the grouchy old Curb Your Enthusiasm star in a habit and hating life. Decades pass, yet nobody ages, and because there must be a plot that involves more than falling off of ladders, the Stooges must somehow secure $830,000 to save the orphanage from going under. Enter Sofia Vergara as a scandalous gold digger looking to off her husband for his money, and somehow those orange oompa loompas from the Jersey Shore show up, as well. Why? Because the film simply isn't stupid enough, the Farrellys must completely turn brains into mush.

The occasional ""Nyuk nyuk"" does not a successful comedy make, and while the three stars may have the voices and mannerisms of the trio down pat, there isn't a hint of originality anywhere. Laughs are few, far between, and with the uncomfortable realization of watching a slow moving car wreck. A new low is reached as they wield newborn babies like weapons of mass urination in a hospital room. Does that sound like The Three Stooges? Not really. It's Farrelly Brothers humor, which is nothing like what Moe, Larry, and Curly perfected for so long. So not only is The Three Stooges terribly unfunny, but it has no clue what made them tick.",1334275200,17,3000,4.629699248120301
