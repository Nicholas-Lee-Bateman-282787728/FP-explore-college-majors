8412206,4,B0040843C4,A wonderful bout of nostalgia. I used to watch this when I was a child. It has the original Japanese opening rather than the U.S. Opening but I still enjoyed this series as much as Gundam Wing,1434844800,4,192,4.216216216216216
8412207,5,B0040843C4,"For ten long years, I've been trying to get the complete series of the cartoon! It has everything, even the ones that didn't make it to the states until a few years ago on DVD!!!! The first disc has 20 episodes, the second disc has the next 19 episodes and the third disc has the OVA's that never aired in the US, but was released later on DVD!!!!",1363564800,12,347,4.117647058823529
8412208,3,B0040843C4,"There are some things you should be aware of. The ""editorial Review"" states:Episodes: #1-39 & #1-2 (Complete Series) Audio: English, Japanese Subtitle: English Running Time: Approx. 1150 minutes DVDs: 8

First of all,there are indeed only 3 Discs instead of 8. Secondly, the box I received is different from the one pictured and the language and subtitle info is wrong. I bought this anime with Japanese audio & English subtitles being the deciding factor as to whether or not I would buy it. I had previously seen it in English years ago and was curious about how different the original version would be. When I got it, the back of the box read: -Audio: English -Subtitle: None. Despite my reading otherwise on this very page. I returned to this page and realized my mistake. I overlooked the part in the ""editorial review"" about 8 Discs on an item called a ""3 Disc Box Set"" Oops! Silly me, I actually trusted the ""editorial review"" for the item I wanted to buy. Seeing that it was on the actual page of said item and all. So what we have here is a review for a different version of the same product. Oh well, you live and learn.

As it turns out, Disc 1&2 had English audio and no subs, while Disc 3 (the OVA disc) had English & Japanese audio with English subtitles so even the product's own box was wrong.
Before you order this from anyone, just be sure to contact the seller and find out in detail EXACTLY what they're selling.",1334880000,41,1432,4.482758620689655
