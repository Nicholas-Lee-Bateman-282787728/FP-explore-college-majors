2102134,4,B0002KVUS4,"I have waited SOOO long for this season to come out.  It is the best season with my absolute all time favorite episode, ""Sweet Sixteen.""  I can still remember watching that episode for the first time.  I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was that this episode is edited from its original airing.  There are three scenes missing, they are small, but key!  The one where Laura buys her shoes (with heels to make her look taller and older) and the one where she is determined to learn to walk in them!  This is important because not too long after that we realize that it worked!  Almonzo takes notice of her and she looks down at her shoes and tucks them uderneath her.  I was really hoping that when the DVDs were released they would show the COMPLETE episodes and not the ""edited for TBS"" versions.  I'm bummed.",1098921600,48,820,4.413333333333333
2102135,5,B0002KVUS4,"This is one of my all time favourite seasons of Little House on the Prairie which ran from 1979 to 1980, and I've been looking forward to getting this one for some time. This is the season when we first meet Almanzo Wilder(Manny) and the beginning of Laura's crush which really was love at first sight. Almanzo doesn't know she exists which leads to some very interesting predicaments. Who could forget the Cinnamon Chicken with a little extra spice or Almanzo 'rescuing' ""Beth"" (Laura Elizabeth) from Nellie? The season climax is the resolution for Laura's love for Almanzo which is really quite sweet. Melissa Gilbert grows up before our eyes during this season, but we have to wait until the 7th season before they get married. This is also the season when Rev. Alden gets married, and also when, through the episode of Annabelle, that they tackle the sensitive issue of being overweight and loving someone for what they have on the inside. I am hoping that the 3 part Thanksgiving series will also be included with this DVD. I am glad to see that there are some extra features as well. Thank you to Jamie for listing all the episodes.

Aug. 2006:  When I wrote this review I did not realize that parts of the episode ""Sweet 16"" have been omitted in this dvd release.  They also didn't include the Thanksgiving 3-part series, ""The Little House Years"".  LHOTP fans deserve better.  It makes me wonder what else they cut out and it is most disappointing.",1097452800,55,1455,4.66796875
2102136,5,B0002KVUS4,"Season 6 introduces us to Ms Wilder, Almonzo and Perley Wilder, Nels Oleson's sister Annabelle, Caroline's father, and Nellie's future husband Percival. Season 6 contains 23 episodes and some of the best Little House on the Prairie episodes ever!  It also contains some of the biggest tear-jerker episodes ever.  I must admit, the quality of the sound and picture is not what I had hoped it would be.  Very poor quality.

If you read the fine print, all of the season's say they may not work after 2016 and there is no warning of this in the listing. The first five went through for me but this one I was outta luck.  I'm working on returning and will try one more time.  Also know that the digital copy is ONLY through Vudu, which is a Walmart company and a complete hassle so there's that too.

2102248,5,B0002KVUS4,"Lionsgate has released the 1st 6 seasons of the wonderful television series little house on the prairie on blu ray disc, But has decided to not release the final 3 seasons! Us fans want the opportunity to purchase every season of this wonderful show in full! in high quality, because let's face it, the quality of most tv series these days is sorely lacking in good old fashioned morals, and those shows that are of a wonderful quality that ALL the family can enjoy, should be preserved in a way that it should be, in a high quality state!

It is truly an experience!  I could knock this release a star for not including the season special, ""The Little House Years"", but this release has so much more going for it that I cannot rate it lower than 5 stars.

Well for that matter so is any episode but this especially.  This is the episode that made me realized that they do edit in syndication as I seen it syndication not long after the repeat showing on nbc that summer. I was only 11 at the time and have been disappointed with the syndicated version all these years. I always knew the fire sequence was chopped up.  What I didn't remember was it being a 2 parter because I remember the repeat showing that summer on nbc was a 2hr movie and that's where they took the syndicated version from but it's coming to me, seems like it did say part 1 and 2 the first time but still in one night. This is, without a doubt, my absolute favorite episode of lhotp and any show. This had all the drama you would want in an episode. Thanks lionsgate.

Especially if you have children this is a fantastic moral values teaching tool, while being highly entertaining.
It's great to be able to pause, and discuss parts.  My daughter especially was having me pause more than I was.  Michael Landon (God rest his soul) was a genius of a kind.  No matter how often these are watched, either old lessons and values are reinforced or new ones are noticed and learned.

2102403,5,B0002KVUS4,"This is one of my favorite seasons because this is the season Almanzo Wilder comes!  In fact, that's how the entire season starts.  He rides into the school yard and Laura falls madly in love with him right there.

Mary is sadly down-graded in this season.  We don't see much of her and know that's her character isn't going to last that much longer.  We also say goodbye to Alice Garvey in one of the most controversial episodes of all times - ""May We Make Them Proud.""  This is an episode I cannot even bring myself to watch most times.

Some of my favorite episodes:

2102451,5,B0002KVUS4,"Little House on the Prairie - Season 6

The original nine books could never have provided enough material for the nine TV seasons. New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows. The real question is: how authentically did they follow the original stories? Some fans of the original books were disappointed by these TV adaptions. New characters were introduced. Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and reach a wider audience. These books were written in the mid 1930s from her personal experiences which no historian can match. Laura lost her life savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Laura's books can see things that a teenager may miss. The economic depressions of their era are referenced implicitly by the family migrations. Young Laura would have little knowledge of these problems. An older Laura censored events that were not suitable for children's books. This was NBC's highest rated series during most of its nine years. Here are the titles of the twenty-four shows.

Season 6 was my favorite season of Little House on the Prairie and ""Sweet Sixteen"" my favorite episode.

I was slightly worried I wasn't going to be able to return it alone since I did get them at a super saver discount. Returning the one season was actually much easier then I thought it would be (thank goodness!). I had originally planned on exchanging it, but season 9 was not available from the seller so I had to go with a refund. The money was returned within a few days.

2102465,1,B0002KVUS4,"I liked the LHOTP series up until now.  The series seems to have lost its foundation and are now making episodes that are set in 1979 but wearing  long dresses.
I was repulsed by the moral message of 'The Werewolf of Walnut Grove.'  Apparently the only way to deal with violence is to get everybody on your side and start kicking.  What happened to love thy neighbour?  Do unto others?  I thought that boy would be killed at the end- this is how it could have happened.  This is not behaviour I want my children to emulate.  The mean song sung by the bully was in fact written by the real Laura, who hated Eliza and played on her weaknesses.
For some reason many of the scenes intended to be moving left me cold and I hardly know why.  In 'May We Make Them Proud' I have no idea what anybody was doing to make anybody proud.  The scene where Alice and the baby died was horrifically graphic.  Why did Mary leave the baby behind in the first place- she was right next to him.  Mary thrusting her arms through the broken glass was also gratuitous and disgusting.  Everybody whinged about the size of Mrs Olesen's plaque, then they bought one exactly the same size.
A greenbroke horse drives for a little girl but not a man?
Mrs Olesen sits with her skirt up to her knees and her legs apart- is she a prostitute?
Ma was 30 when she had her second child?  This was extremely old in those times.  She went to college?  Charles would have been lucky to make it past eighth grade, for a woman to go to college? Rare.
Ma tolerated a drunk in her house?
Ma has lost her manners.  Pa has lost his faith. The mantelpiece hasn't been cleaned since they moved in.
And Nellie has so many wrinkles around her eyes she looks like Baby Jane.
I didn't enjoy this season.  It has lost its beauty and degenerated into vulgarity and questionable morals.
I am highly disappointed.",1323302400,2,1858,4.336231884057971

I still remember as a kid watching this show from week to week with new interest in seeing how Laura was going to win the heart of her future-husband, Almanzo Wilder.  Dean Butler was a great addition to the cast, and his commentary on this DVD is very good.

However, the problem that I have with this DVD set, as with Season 5, is that it is NOT complete.  There are many scenes missing from a number of episodes.  Don't you find it odd that virtually every other TV show that has made it to DVD is done so unedited?!?  I've heard that NBC tried to pull the same thing with the first season of the Cosby Show until enough complaints to NBC forced them to make sure that all subsequent releases were, in fact, unedited.

It's a real shame that such a classic family show as this is not being given the quality that it should be.  These ""missing"" scenes are not lost.  I've seen them in re-runs on television.

This is the only reason I give three stars to this product.  It's a definite five for the show itself.  You have to wonder that if Michael Landon was alive, would he tolerate such tampering with his show?

Note: It seems that most of the TV series that are released through NBC Home Entertainment are edited.  These include Little House, Cosby Show, and Highway to Heaven from what I've seen and possibly others.",1175212800,17,1420,4.349809885931559

These years showcase Melissa Sue Anderson as one of the most amazing actresses of the 70's and 80's.  I was most anxious to get season 6, expecting the three part 'Little House Years' and the pivotal deleted scene from 'May We Make Them Proud' - where the blind boy goes into the bathroom to blow his nose, consequently resulting in the deaths of Adam Jr and Alice Garvey, neither of which are included in this collection.  Other than that disappointment - I suppose that scene is forever lost from the episode, I have not scene it in the reruns in ten years or more - I strongly suggest any new fan, or anyone trying to chose between one season to purchase, pick up season 6 first - then get 4 and 5!

It's too bad the show didn't focus more on 'Little Town on the Prairie' and 'These Happy Golden Years', where Laura sews shirts to make extra money for the family and Almanzo sort-of-courting her in his sled her when she was teaching her first school.

2102548,4,B0002KVUS4,"I have purchased all 6 seasons of Little House, and have the 7th season on reserve. If I were not such a fan of Little House, I would return these DVD's due to their poor quality and missing scenes. I kept feeling that a scene was missing here or there, but wasn't sure until I saw the ""Sweet Sixteen"" episode. As another reviewer reported, there is a complete segment of the show missing. We see Laura walking through the dry grass on her way to school and she stumbles ever so slightly as she walks. What is not shown is that directly before this clip, she has purchased a new pair of ""mature"" heeled shoes and had to learn to walk in them. Later, during their carriage ride home, ""manly"" seemingly sees a more mature Laura. Laura looks down at her new shoes, clearing feeling that they are responable for ""manly's"" new found interest in her. Having not seen Laura purchase the new shoes, a viewer might be clueless to this very important part of the story line.

I expected to have the entire UNCUT version of Little House. I am deeply disapointed to own a poor edited version of my favorite show. I noticed missing scenes in several of the other DVD's also. I gave the product 4 stars, simply because Little House is still, in my opinion, one of the best shows to ever appear on TV.

If you're fan, why are you reading this? I love this collection and these shows are still good enough to go back to prime time, I'm so bummed out there is no quality stuff like this on the tube anymore.

Be that as it may, take care of that issue and go out and buy this now. The box sets of all these DVD's are absolutely fantastic, I love to go back from season to season and see everyone grow and notice the changes in Walnut Grove. This big season Laura falls in love with Almonzo and the most rememembered, however disheartening episode, is when the blind school is burned down and Alice Garvey dies and Mary loses her baby in the fire. I still get shivers and cry during this episode everytime.  I found out that the character ""Alice"" Garvey wanted to give up the role as Alice and start a family--- so no time for acting, so what do they do? They burn her alive! Nice grand exit Alice, anyway, I think the collection is of 12-13 episodes, with some interviews with Alison Engram (Nellie) and the reverend Alden. The picture and sound is fine for the most part, although I noticed some ""audio"" distortions in  some of the episodes, it sounds like the music was coming from the rear end of a cow, but it's only noticeable on a few episodes.

I don't know if the rest are as good as this one but this one is definitely my favorite.  I've already preordered the next one.  I enjoyed this as a kid and my kids enjoy it very much too.  My boys enjoy the more action packed episodes of course and there are plenty of them.  I would recommend this and the other 5 seasons of this great show.",1100476800,3,560,4.196261682242991
2102561,3,B0002KVUS4,"I can say very little to add more weight to what other reviewers say about what a great show 'Little House on the Prairie' is and how glad I am that it has arrived on DVD.

Like so many of you though, I am rather shocked and saddened by the poor quality of the source material on the discs.

It is clear to me that no remastering has been done at all.  The programmes appear to have been transferred straight across from analogue broadcast tapes (I work in television in the UK).  Tape dropout is evident on some of the episodes so I would imagine the source to be a 1"" or Betacam SP master.  Remastering is when you go back to the original 35mm film negatives and make a fresh film print or digital tape master from that negative, colour correct it scene by scene and paint out any dirt or scratches using modern computer software.  I would love the producers of these DVDs to offer some kind of explanation as to why the barest minimum effort has been put in.  I can live with a few scratches and jumps as long as all the episode content is there and the picture is sharp and colourful, but many purchasers are reporting episdoes with missing scenes, which for a collectors boxset, is appalling.

The main fault could lie with Worldvision, the distributors of the series who may have supplied duff ex-broadcast master tapes.  Again though I'm sure all would agree that it is down to the video company to check them, and if they are poor or edited, send them back and demand better ones.  You only need to check the run time to see if it is short.  After all people are paying money for these discs.

The original runs of 'Little House' in the UK were broadcast directly from 35mm film prints and so the quality was always nice.  It is only since the latter part of the 1980's when distributors began supplying film series on videotape that the quality problems started, especially if converting from the USA's NTSC television system to the UK's PAL.  Analogue NTSC was absolute rubbish and accounts for the washed out pictures you are now encountering on these DVD's.",1100044800,18,2069,4.468085106382978

2102563,4,B0002KVUS4,"Rewatching this series has been a guilty pleasure of mine for a little over a year now. I first started watching seasons 1 to 5 on Netflix, but then Netflix inexplicitely pulled season 5 forcing me to buy the set to indulge my addiction. It's great coming home after work and watching something that doesn't assault the senses and it's also just great to relive childhood memories of watching the show. BUT, I do have to say that what everyone is saying about the DVD quality it true.  The transfers have gotten so progressively worse that at this point it is just insulting to fans to call this a ""collector's edition"". It's more like a ""let's make a quick buck"" edition to the producers of these DVDs. It's rumoured netflix pulled season 5 due to quality complaints and now in watching season 6 it's much worse. Many episodes sound and look worse than on the original broadcasts. The studio who is producing these obviously doesn't care or in reality do not own the original proof recordings. Also, the ""special features"" are a joke in season 6, they just reinvite back the same people and the interviewer is indeed beyond creepy. Where is Melissa Gilbert and Karen Grassle? Why haven't they agreed to appear in the extras? Once I'm done watching these discs I plan on doing the same thing that I did with season 5, post it right back up on Amazon for sale for another fan to buy and enjoy.",1099958400,2,1392,4.5458167330677295
2102564,1,B0002KVUS4,"The show is great, I have all the other seasons as well, but the quality of this DVD collection is again horrific. The audio is sometimes mangled, like a worn out VHS tape. The video is not much better. I do no understand this since the DVD states that they used state of the art technology to clean up/enhacing the originals. It looks like they have taken the cut-up TV tape versions and slammed them on a DVD. Certainly not collectors item quality. I'd rather pay a few bucks more for a better, much better, quality.",1099958400,6,518,4.40625
2102565,3,B0002KVUS4,"I was anxious to buy Season 6's DVD collection because one of the best Little House episodes EVER is ""Sweet Sixteen.""  After it originally aired on NBC they cut out IMPORTANT scenes from this episode to make room for more commercials in syndication.  During ""Sweet Sixteen"" after Almanzo FINALLY notices Laura in a new light, Laura looks down at her shoes under the buckboard seat and smiles knowing her new heels have made her look older finally.  If you didn't see the original on NBC in 1979 though, this scene doesn't make ANY sense!  I am so IRATE that they cut out the scenes of Laura buying high-heeled shoes AFTER Almanzo initially ignores her new grown up look.  They also cut out Laura trying to learn to walk in them.  Why on earth did they delete these scenes from the DVD when there are no commercials? Shame on them!  Also the guy who interviews ""Almanzo"" and ""Nellie"" is CREEPY!!!!!",1099785600,6,897,4.60377358490566
2102566,4,B0002KVUS4,"I just bought Little house on the prairie season #6.  I have enjoyed seasons 1 - 5, and I am enjoying season 6, but was terribly dissapointed when I noticed that the three hour special

""Little house years "" thanksgiving special was not included. ?Is there a way of obtainig it?",1099699200,,278,4.431372549019608
2102567,4,B0002KVUS4,"I have been waiting for this season to come out and I am so happy that it finally has.  My rating is not because of the show but because of the quality of the dvds, they were better than 1-5 but they still had some problems with picture and sound nothing major though.  There were interviews with Dean Butler, Alison Arngrim, and Dabs Greer, they were pretty informative and it was nice to have some extras.  There was also commentary from Alison Arngrim on Back to School Part 2.  Overall I was not disappointed and it was worth the wait I can't wait for Season 7 to come out on February 15, 2005.",1099267200,3,598,4.265486725663717
2102568,4,B0002KVUS4,"The picture quality on some episodes from this season leaves a bit to be desired, HOWEVER, the addition of a cast commentary by ""Alison Arngrim"" (Nellie) on Part 2 of ""Back to School"" more than makes up for any imperfections.
It was so good to hear Alison's insight into the goings on of the show - she even makes mention of Michael Landon's directorial anger.
I must admit that the guy doing the interviews on the Exclusive Interviews special feature absolutely FREAKS ME OUT!
Just take a look at the Interview with ""Dean Butler"" (Almanzo Wilder) on disc 2 and every time it flicks back for a reaction shot from the interviewer he has got the scariest looks on his face (almost like a ""Martin Short"" comedy skit) and he just DOES NOT appear to move (or change expression) for the first half of the interview - he just sits there listening to Dean with his eyebrows raised and his hand at his face.",1099008000,5,898,4.4817073170731705
