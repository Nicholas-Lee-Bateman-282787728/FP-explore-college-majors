2121785,5,B0002V7TZQ,"The O.C. is one of the best dramas of 03-04. You know it's good because so many shows are trying to be The O.C.! Summerland, North Shore, ( which is on the same network) what's next? Well whatever show comes along that takes place at a beach with ""hott"" guys, I will immediately think of Adam Brody and my personal fave, Benjamin Mckenzie. Not only that but The O.C. has Tate Donovan AND Peter Gallagher! Hot Guys, Hot Girls, Hot Location, whats not to love? The plot is even pretty good! Trust me... (and I've only seen like 5 episodes of the first season!) after one epi you'll be hooked. Plenty of Comedy, Romance, Drama, and Life Lessons to be learned. It's quality stuff! At least for teenagers...",1093132800,4,702,4.4921875
2121786,5,B0002V7TZQ,"So, I was hoping the Amazon description would clear up the full screen/wide screen debate. But its not even mentioned (as of today, 8/20/04). Here's what I know so far, the DVD set was and apparently still is going to be full screen. The producers and the creator wanted it to be full screen since that was how they intended to film it. Of course, people with HD have seen the Widescreen HD version, so i don't know why they're releasing it in FS (must be a creative thing). I HAVE seen some unconfirmed rumblings that the dvd set will in fact be WIDESCREEN. But I guess we all won't know until it comes out...

And to the producers of the dvd, if you're reading this, why not include the MadTV skits? and the Ryan (OUT) Seacrest show with the whole cast? And of couse the punk'd episode?",1092960000,4,788,4.324324324324325
2121787,5,B0002V7TZQ,"This is definitely a show I had no doubt a DVD release is well-deserved and anticipated.

An entertainment magazine quoted The O.C. as ""Dawson's Creek meets Hollywood Wives"". In a way this is true, but I believe there's more to it than that. It appeals to almost everyone...

The O.C. is a story about the lives of the rich and the not so rich in the Orange County (hence the title). It focuses on the lives of three teenagers who are coming of age and it delves on how each approach every adventures or misadventures they come upon usually together as friends. To some this might sound cliche and unoriginal but there's a reason why it's one of if not the hottest TV series at present.

It appeals to most, especially the teen populace, which I think makes up a big bulk of the show's fan following, because of relateability to the key characters Ryan, Seth, and Marissa. While it may have some similarity to Dawson's Creek (which I'm not familiar with since I never watched any episode of Dawson's Creek), it is unique in a sense that the characters' backgrounds are based on this place for the rich and famous and how they react to changes in their lives. It also appeals to the grown ups, mainly the mothers, because of it's being a pseudo telenovela or soap. But to the general public, it's a TV program worth watching.

Good and timely stories. Great soundtrack. The Cast are great and they made their characters believably human and not two-dimensional. All in all, it's a labor of love that really paid off.

To those who haven't watched The O.C. before, here's your chance to see what all the fuss is all about and to enjoy it the same way as most people did.",1092960000,16,1668,4.491749174917492
2121788,5,B0002V7TZQ,"Anyone that liked the OC must have this. This show is truly the best show out there.  If you have a borderline desision about buying this DO IT, you WILL NOT be sorry.",1092700800,4,167,4.0606060606060606
2121789,5,B0002V7TZQ,"and nothing like what you imagine...

In August of 2003, the FOX network premired the teen soap, ""The O.C."" which quickly went on to be the network's biggest hit of the year.  The show is about Ryan Atwood, a tought yet intelligent young-man who has the misfourtune of quickly following in his jail-bate brother and fathers footsteps.  But then he meets Sandy Cohen, who along with his wife Kristine, take Ryan into their world.  They Introduce him to a world of fortune, priviledge, and beauty.  But its not long before Ryan realizes the lives hidden deep in the sand, with kids living secret lives from their parents, and parents living secret lives from their kids.

Like most of my favorite show, I discoved the O.C. as a fluk.  For the entire summer I watched the previews and thought it looked like a horrible rip-off of ""Dawson's Creek.""  But my Tivo thought I would like it (becuase I've listed Tate Donavan as one of my favorite actors), and Tivo recorded the pilot.... THANK GOODNESS!  This show has quickly become one of my favorites.

I am glad that Warner Brothers has decided to release this series as quickly as they did (they usually wait until season three to release the first season DVD, like everwood and smallville).

If your a fan of Dawson's Creek or One Tree Hill or Dallas, this is a show for you.",1092268800,32,1322,4.6068376068376065
2121790,5,B0002V7TZQ,This is one of the best shows out there today. Trust me its worth the 50 bucks. Any true OC fan should have this DVD. I can't wait to buy it.,1092268800,4,141,3.5806451612903225

2121839,5,B0002V7TZQ,"The O.C.-one of the best shows ever and forever, and thats why: not only is it an encouraging, positive show that lifts you up when you need to watch something to forget the world and its cruelty, it does so without being destructive/not at the cost of other people/values. There is no clumsy, obvious affirmative action (which is always reverse racism underneath), there is no bashing of Europeans/non-Americans for the sake of a nasty political agenda/clumsy propaganda, there is no twisting of historical facts (especially European ones), no turning European legends into villains and so on. And yet, it is a thrilling, entertaining, sometimes thought-provoking show  yes, it can be done, and it can be done successfully and artfully. True, there have been shows about teenagers in rich neighborhoods before, true, there have been shows about unlike couplings/brothers. There have been shows about noble criminals and teenage romance. But this show unites it all in a unique and charming way, and adds a lot of heart and soul and smartness. This is not just a dumb teenie/romance/hypocritical family show, these are beautifully written, round (and perfectly cast) characters with heart and wits  entertaining and educating at the same time (without being overly didactic). This is the show I would recommend to parents to show their kids in order to show them how to behave in the world. A truly uplifting, funny and also instructive show  for viewers and writers alike, this is how it is done, you can entertain/be entertained without violence and xenophobia. A plus!!",1492387200,,1572,5.1328125

2122055,4,B0002V7TZQ,"I'm only giving it 4 stars because, even though this is a new ""remastered"" edition of the original U.S. release (as stated in the release date), it's not the newly remastered 16:9 Widescreen pressing that was included in the U.S. 2007 highly-expensive ""Beach Experience"" (28 discs) set. It is just the same ""standard version"" that was released back in 2004, in 4:3 format and with the same special features, but only packaged in a fairly big plastic keepcase. That's all.
Such a shame that Warner Bros has decided to only include the Widescreen version in a highly-expensive set, and not releasing it also as a stand-alone option, for those who already own Seasons 2-4.
I only hope the entire Seasons will get a definitive Blu-Ray collector's edition set, sometime in the near future. As that way, we can finally get a proper HD 16:9 release of Season 1, finally.",1457568000,,863,4.798657718120805

2122341,3,B0002V7TZQ,"Well, this show takes me back to my youth. I bought the first three seasons and have been watching them before bed for some time now. They are as bad as you will remember and they are as good. If you want to know how teen girls really dressed in this era, this is a great source. Marissa and I frequently had the same style and hairdos. It's weird that I never noticed it before. Marisa is also unbearable. Like Serena from GG, only Blake Lively is a likable person whereas Mischa Barton probably isn't. The whole time she's on screen I am just in awe of how thin she is, and questioning if she's pretty or just thin. This show boosted indie rock music into becoming mainstream as well as made the geeky Seth Cohen boy the new yuppy of the millenial generation. This show is not by any means good, but it is a great reflection of how beautiful people influence reality. Give it a watch. You'll be dying to head out to California and hit the tanning salon for the first time in seven years.",1409616000,,989,4.26595744680851
2122342,5,B0002V7TZQ,"The O.C. was the latest in a line of teen-centric night time soap operas that sprang up in the early-mid 2000s.  It was what I would describe as a mini ""it show"" in that it was very popular out of the gate, and had some main stream exposure.  It was not necessarily a show that you could not miss on a weekly basis, but it was talked about a lot.  The easy comparisons are to shows like 90210, Dawson's Creek etc.  There are certainly elements from those shows, and pretty much every other show in the genre that popped up in this one.  But unlike some of those, the show also made the stories with the adults interesting enough that you did not have to be in (or recently graduated from) high school at the time to appreciate it.

The first season had a lot of episodes (27 in all) and as a result the story lines were kind of all over the place.  It had a very large ensemble cast (some of whom would eventually be weeded out) and there was a lot going on with all the characters.  The main story revolved around Ryan Atwood (played by Benjamin McKenzie) who  was a good kid from Chino, but who had a bad family situation and was starting to follow his brother into a life of Crime.  His public defender Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher) ends up taking him in (initially for the weekend) much to the chagrin of his wife (Kelly Rowan).  The first part of the season really plays on Ryan adjusting to life in the rich, glitzy Newport Beach as he falls for the girl next door, Marissa (played by Mischa Barton), befriends the Cohen's teenage son Seth (played wonderfully by Adam Brody) and is always teetering on the edge of going back to juvie.

The adult stories center around the Cohen's, the next door neighbors the Coopers and Kirsten Cohen's rich real estate mogul Caleb (played by Alan Dale).  The standout from that story in my opinion was Julie Cooper, played by Melinda Clarke, who does a great ""bad guy"" character.  In the beginning of the series she was almost an over the top caricature  of the rich, snobby housewife who only cares about money, gossip and how she looks.  Clarke stole almost every scene she was in, especially when her character was basically the butt of a joke, and she became more and more central to the story.

The first season almost suffered from doing too much too soon.  They were jamming so many stories into the first season that it seemed to jump all over the place.  They honestly probably had enough material in the Ryan ""crossing the tracks"" story, and developing that to get through the season without introducing Kirsten's sister, some of the other Chino characters etc until season 2.  That said, the show did a good enough job of juggling it all, ending a couple of the story lines (even though it meant getting rid of a couple of the characters), and making things flow well enough that it did not get too hard to follow.

Overall the show was very good and entertaining.  It was at time somewhat formulaic, given the genre.  The themes mirrored many other similar shows, but thew in a Westside Story vibe and made it unique enough that it did not just seem like a carbon copy.  The writing and acting were very good.  The Ryan-Seth relationship (and all the things that stemmed from that like the Seth-Summer-Anna love triangle) made the teen part of the show work, and Peter Gallagher, who was involved in almost all the story lines set around the adults made everything else work.  It definitely had the guilty pleasure soap-opera elements to it.  Lots of skin (especially early on) and the will they/wont they bounce with the Ryan-Marissa relationship, but it also focused on more serious subjects like physical abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, homosexuality, abortion and the seemingly required adult-teenager sexual relationship.

As far as extras go, there are a few making of and behind the scenes features on the last disc, as well as some deleted scenes.  There are also commentary tracks on select episodes.  Definitely enough there for those who like to watch the bonus material.  The show is certainly not for everyone.  If you only watch documentaries and high-brow dramas, this is not going to be your cup of tea.  But it is a show that blended comedy and drama, and touched on enough serious subject matter that if you are a fan of the genre then you will probably like it.",1409443200,2,4332,4.555555555555555

ryan now has a brother, who is the exact opposite of him. tough, athletic and quiet ""bad boy"" meet geeky, comic-loving and video-playing, always talking boy from a good family. ryan also soon meets marissa, the rich girl next door, and falls for her. her boyfriend luke is obviously not very happy about that. and seth now sees a chance that summer, the girl he's been in love with since sixth grade, will finally notice him, now that he has ryan by his side.

there is no doubt that you will totally fall in love with the authentic, charming and amazing characters of the oc. the show is absolutely hilarious and especially the conversations between dry-humored ryan and sarcastic seth will make you burst out laughing over and over again.
when i was watching the oc i did everything in front of the tv and stayed up until three because i couldn't stop watching. it was bad :D
i highly recommend this show for anyone who's a teenager or older. my mother loves it as much as i do.
i do not recommend it for younger kids though because there are some rahter brutal fighting scenes in it. especially when you get to the later seasons.

all in all, amazing show. i feel like i'm friends with the people in it. which is kind of sad but also a proof that it is a really good show :D

The show was irritatingly addictive.  Within five weeks, all of my friends were watching too.  The show is ridiculous, on so many levels.  So much more ridiculous than Beverly Hills 90210, but I think that is the appeal.

The show burns so brightly the first 10 episodes that it was bound to let down eventually.  The inclusion and persistence of the Oliver story arc proves this, but, in the end, the 27 episodes in season 1 are some of my favorite television.

I was expecting a stupid teen soap with no substance or importance, but when I finally watched it I found a smart unique show that always challenged the audience's wit. It possessed clever story lines, perfect dialogue, fantastic characters, and episodes that leave you on the edge of your seat. As soon as I saw it I couldn't believe that I'd ever thought it was stupid. The commercials portrayed it to be something that it completely wasn't, the next 90210. All the seasons were good but not nearly as good as the never stop action of the first. All 27 episodes are enthralling, drama, comedy, tragedy, all rolled up in the neat little bundle that is The OC's first season. Compared to other TV shows, nothing reached the level of perfection as this season. So skeptics step aside, you may be surprised by what you find...",1219190400,,958,4.543352601156069
2122525,5,B0002V7TZQ,"The FOX Television Network scored a major hit in 2003 when The O.C. premiered on August 5. The show at first seemed to be the next logical step in updating the Beverly Hills 90210 and Dawson's Creek teen soap genre for the 2000s. In many ways it improved on the formula in its first season and used up and coming music stars to propel the action on screen, making stars of little known recording artists in the process. However, the show's quick rise to popularity is often compared to its equally swift fall. But that's not to say that the first season was a mediocre one.

I didn't catch the show during the 2003-2004 TV season, but viewed the entire season on the subsequently released DVD set. The story centers around fish-out-of-water Ryan, a brooding, bad-boy teenager who moves in with a rich Newport Beach family in Southern California. The Cohens are a family with money - mother Kirsten works for her rich father, who is at odds with father Sandy, a local attorney. It's Sandy who represents Ryan in a case and ultimately invites him into his home.

The key partnership in the series is between Ryan and Seth, the Cohen's son. The show centers around dorky Seth's relationship to bad-boy Ryan, who is sort of like the big brother he never had. The boys juggle relationships with fellow classmates Marissa and Summer, while tackling the usual blend of teen drama along the way.

I always think I've seen it all when I see a teen drama like Beverly Hills 90210, which was remixed for the late nineties with Dawson's Creek. But The OC somehow manages to be just as good, if not better, during its first season. The first half of the season was particularly good, with things slowing down after a plot involving an unstable friend of Marissa's named Oliver, who develops an obsessive crush. Other plots involve Marissa's struggle with alcohol and the divorce of her mother and father.

Perhaps the slight lag during the last quarter of the season kicked off the amazingly swift downfall of the series. In the end, four seasons aired, each with a major percentage of viewer loss in the ratings. Adam Brody, Mischa Barton, Benjamin McKenzie, Kelly Rowan, Rachel Bilson and Peter Gallagher are the main cast of stars that propelled this FOX drama into an overnight sensation that burned out way before it should have.

2122526,5,B0002V7TZQ,"This show had me hooked from the very first episode. I usually like teenager shows like 90210, Dawson's Creek, Gossip Girl...etc.  If you like those shows too...this one won't disappoint you. Not only was I intrigued by the teenage characters that the shows revolves around, but their parents also cause a LOT of drama.  One the parents actually slept with her own daughter's ex-boyfriend.  This is the type of drama that just keeps me glued.  I've only watched the first season so far and I was very pleasantly surprised that it had 27 episodes.  I buy a lot of TV shows on DVD and most of them don't have this many episodes in one season.",1216512000,,640,4.530434782608696
2122527,1,B0002V7TZQ,"Now let me start off by saying that I love this show, I really do. I even own all of the DVDs. (Yes, including this season) But I didn't always think so highly of this show, and this season is the reason why.

I started watching The OC mid-season one, largely due to my sister because she was the original OC fan in the house. And unfortunately the first episodes that I ever set my eyes on were the Oliver episodes. So now you may understand why I immediately stopped watching it, and nearly gave it up for a lost cause (until I watched it towards the end of season 2. Trey made me a fan again)

There are also a few other problems with this season. Summer is highly unlikeable, as she is nothing more than an annoying bimbo. (I love her in the later seasons though) The whole summer-seth-anna love triangle is utterly annoying and so predictable, as you already know that Seth was going to choose Summer all along, even when he was dating Anna. Ryan does nothing but get into fights with people. I mean you would think that after a while Sandy and Kirsten would realize that they really shouldn't have anymore fancy parties because they would only result in ryan fighting.

But there are also a few good episodes in this season that do make it worth watching. Such as the pilot and the few episodes afterward as you see Ryan, the boy from the broken home, finally find a loving home. And the best one of all is the one where they go to Mexico and Marissa tries to commit suicide. Mischas acting was superb in that one.

To wrap things up, ill just have to say that while this is the worse season of the 4 in my opinion, I would still recommend that you watch it (don't say I didn't warn you about Oliver though!) but if you do watch this one, just be sure that you watch the remaining seasons as well, that way you'll get to see what the show is really made of",1213142400,2,1862,4.236619718309859
2122528,5,B0002V7TZQ,"Let me start off by saying that this show is and will always be amazing. It's a classic and I garauntee will be remembered years and years from now. The first season is amazing, like no other TV show. The plots are so interesting and great. The pilot? Best episode that really gets you in the mood for the show. Ever start a show and watch the pilot, thinking, it will hopefully get better? But you won't be thinking ""hopefully it gets better"" because they don't get any better than this.

The characters, in my opinion, are the most likeable out of any TV show. With the four main ones, Ryan, Marissa, Seth and Summer, I can't say I don't like one of them. They are all unique, and I think Marissa is the best. She creates drama for the show, really good looking, and believable for teens in this generation. It really is a shame for how her fate turned out, which probably everyone knows what happens to her, but I won't say more. Let's just say I'm devastated TO this day.

Maybe that's why this show is so good. Even after it gets cancelled and you don't watch it for a while, the characters stay with you, the tragic events stay with you and they don't leave. It's an unforgettable show.

However, after the first season the show started to decrease in its quality. Seasons 2-3 are all amazing, don't get me wrong, but the first season just has that feeling. I don't know what it is. Mostly the feeling of them being rich, living in a wealthy community, ongoing parties and debutantes, the characters being fresh...everything.

The first season is the best in my opinion. But if you haven't seen this show and start from this season (which you should), you'll never stop. It's that good.

There will never be a show like The O.C.",1208476800,,1734,4.440251572327044

I also loved the relationships between the adults & figured my mom may even like watching this show. I sometimes wished my family was more like this.

I give it only three stars because I wish the show had more of the interactions between the four actors who are the leads and fewer shootings, fires, overdosing, etc.  I understand it is supposed to be a soap opera, but I find myself looking forward to the interactions between Seth and Ryan, or Summer or Marissa more than another fight, shooting or something.

2122566,1,B0002V7TZQ,"It's not pleasant to hear, but it's very important, and it's part of telling the truth. Although not without overlap and simplification, I plan to identify three primary positions on The OC's endeavors. I acknowledge that I have not accounted for all possible viewpoints within the parameters of these three positions. Nevertheless, The OC's ploys are not witty satire, as it would have you believe. They're simply the logorrheic ramblings of something that has no idea or appreciation of what it's mocking.

I'm not writing this review for your entertainment. I'm not even writing it for your education. I'm writing it for our very survival. The OC intends to create a new social class. Obdurate, self-absorbed boneheads, incontinent, crass paper-pushers, and feckless, balmy pop psychologists will be given aristocratic status. The rest of us will be forced into serving as their janissaries.

It is more than a purely historical question to ask, ""How did The OC's reign of terror start?"" or even the more urgent question, ""How might it end?"". No, we must ask, ""Is it really The OC's impression that pharisaism is the key to world peace?"" To rephrase that question, how can something that claims to be so educated and so open-minded dare to fund a vast web of brainless, antihumanist fomenters of revolution, fickle soulless-types, and juvenile blusterers? There aren't enough hours in the day to fully answer that question, but consider this: For those of us who make our living trying to fight to the end for our ideas and ideals, it is important to consider that its crude bruta fulmina brainwash the masses into submission. The OC then blames us for that. Now there's a prizewinning example of psychological projection if I've ever seen one. The OC's self-fulfilling prophecies are destructive. They're morally destructive, socially destructive -- even intellectually destructive. And, as if that weren't enough, the last time I told The OC's patsies that I want to burn away social illness, exploitation, and human suffering, they declared in response, ""But honor counts for nothing."" Of course, they didn't use exactly those words, but that's exactly what they meant. I have seen and heard enough. Now, it is time to improve the physical and spiritual quality of life for the population at present and for those yet to come. The only way out of The OC's rat maze is to detail the specific steps and objectives needed to thwart its licentious little schemes. It's that simple.",1171411200,4,2483,5.038929440389294

2122571,5,B0002V7TZQ,"The saga of a delinquent who finds himself living in affluent Newport Beach makes for must-see entertainment. Chino bad boy Ryan (Benjamin McKenzie) is rescued from jail by his attorney (Peter Gallagher) and becomes part of his family.  His wife Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) isn't sure she wants the brooding boy near her son (Adam Brody) who is the quintessential comic book geek.  And then there are the girls:  Moody Marissa (Mischa Barton), Seth's secret crush Summer (Rachel Bilson), and spunky Theresa from Chino. Marissa's troubled parents and Kirsten's powerful father have their share of drama, too.  This season had the most memorable one-liners (who can forget Summer's first ""Ewww!"" or Luke's ""welcome"" to Ryan?) and one of the most poignant season finales ever.

Teens enjoy the show's trendy music and fashions, while older viewers  consider it a guilty pleasure; it certainly is deliciously decadent, romantic, funny, shocking, and, of course, beautiful.  The secret lives of the spoiled Newpsies contrast nicely with the outsider's two-fisted approach to life, until he realizes they're not so different after all.  Season One has all the angst of high school junior year, as well as the social and financial machinations of the middle-agers.  The action all revolves around Ryan, sensitively played by McKenzie and the wonderful Peter Gallagher is strong as the noble and wise dad.

Extras are few but it's still a terrific DVD set that will satisfy your craving for all things O.C.",1158451200,8,1492,5.179166666666666

2122584,5,B0002V7TZQ,"Yes, it happened. Marissa finally attracted a little too much boy drama and it finally ended her on the OC. (Fans of the OC are actually quite upset at this and even are making 'Save Marissa' web sites all over- just Google Save Marissa and you'll see!) But the point is- she's gone. Yet after watching last season and realizing the amazing four would only be the amazing three now, I started missing Marissa. She was annoying at times oh yes, but her character was a big part of the show, and she did bring a lot of drama to the show that kept us watching. Without her who knows what will happen now. We'll have to see next time OC comes on, but I bought Season One to remember some of her best moments on the show.

That wasn't the only reason though, but it was what finally compelled me to buy the complete first season. I also bought season one because I must say I forgot a lot of what happened back then. The seasons after had so much drama to remember that a lot of season one's scenes I totally forgot. I must admit season one had some of the funniest moments, and some of the most drammatic. I got so hooked on the first season that I had the whole season finished in a week. The OC is just that addictive to me.

Is the first season better than the others? Some say so, and I guess on most shows first seasons are the best. I think the OC though has stayed quite strong throughout their whole time, and I cannot wait to see how the next season will unfold, after the death of Marissa. It will take an interesting new turn I feel.

I am a big fan of the OC overall, and I think it is a lot better than some of the other drama shows on now. The actors have actual depth, the problems and worries they have are realistic, and the show can get so emotionally charged that you can't help but be at the end of your seat and feel like you're right there with them. That is what a good show does for us, and the OC is very successful at that especially in season one.

Of Course there are Extras in the box like interviews and something like that. And the quality of the discs is also great.

I don't care for television shows, but being in the industry I received a call from one of the actresses on this show, Mischa Barton, and I had never heard of her, but I had heard of The O.C. as the billboards were everywhere.  So I cracked down and decided to watch a few episodes.  What ended up happening was I got hooked in and ended up watching the entire series.

I thought the show was well done and entertaining.  It wasn't as shallow or lame as I had imagined it might be from the billboards.  What I loved about it also is that it's not a show just for teens.  They managed to balance the teen stuff with the air time for the adults making it appealing for people of all ages.  In fact I found the adult stuff more interesting as they were so good especially the Cohen's.  The kind of family you want to meet and get to know.

I remember when this show was running and people who hadn't been to the O.C. would ask me if the people on the show are really like that in Newport Beach.  There are some similarities and others not so much.  For one, people in Newport are mostly blondes and in the show there are really only two or three blondes and one of those is supposed to be from Chino.  The Kirsten character and her father Caleb and the neighbor Jimmy were pretty accurate portrayals of those in Newport.  Newport is a rich primarily white republican city along the coast.  Although The O.C. was primarily shot at the studios in Manhattan Beach and much of the exteriors were filmed in the surrounding cities such as El Segundo, Marina Del Rey, and Redondo Beaches.  All of which are in L.A.  The opening credits of the show and the aerial shots are more Newport and the O.C, but 97% of the show is shot in L.A.

The O.C. is a guilty entertaining pleasure that I'll go back to every so often just to be transported to that elite beach city with all of its drama and beauty.",1149465600,,2023,4.207792207792208
2122587,4,B0002V7TZQ,"The O.C is a melodramatic series which revolves around the drama of a group of teenagers in Newport. It begins with Ryan arriving to Newport from Chino, when successful attorney Sandy Cohen decides to invite him into his home after defending him in a case. Sandy's son Seth becomes grateful for Ryan's sudden arrival as Summer, Seth's childhood crush begins to finally notice him. Ryan develops a relationship with rich girl, Marissa and the show becomes very dramatic, touching on all matters, ranging from complicated family issues to emotional break ups. There are a lot of parallel situations in the series to show the connection between all the issues and the show demonstrates that rich families are just as troubled as the poor.

The characters in the show are well developed and as an audience, we can easily imagine these characters existing in a real American high school. Seth represents the high school comic geek who desperately seeks attention and respect from his peers, while hopelessly in love with Summer, who with Marissa represent the popular girls at high school who everyone admires. Ryan represents the impulsive guy who thinks everything can be solved by fighting.

This is a worth while teen soap as it is humorous, romantic and intense and deals with life vicissitudes.",1149033600,,1295,5.018604651162791

2122621,5,B0002V7TZQ,"When I first saw previews for this show, I dismissed it as just another teen show that wouldn't interest me at all.  Wow, was I ever wrong!  Yes, this show's teen characters are involved in a thick plot, but the adult scene is just as scandalous and interesting!  This is not one of those shows like 90210 or any other teen soap opera.  There is plenty of enjoyment waiting for any viewer, regardless of age!

This show is centered around a few families in Newport Beach, California (in Orange County).  The primary families are the Cohens, the Coopers, and the Roberts.

Sandy Cohen is a very successful attorney with the Public Defender's Office, and his wife Kirsten is a top-level executive in her father's multi-billion dollar real estate corporation The Newport Group.  Their son Seth starts off as basically an outcast at very his prestigous college preparatory school, but that changes quickly!

Jimmy Cooper is a financial advisor with a few financial problems of his own, and his wife Julie is a self-centered gold-digger.  Their daughter Marissa is a popular and bright student who attends school with Seth.

The Robert's family does not really develop aside from the single daughter, Summer, until the second season.  Summer is popular like Marissa, and they both are spoiled Orange County girls.  Don't be fooled, though, this all changes not so far into the first season.

From premier to finale, The O.C. is, surprisingly, an extreme emotional roller coaster ride with the occasional tear jerker climaxes.  Don't be fooled like I was and dismiss this as something that wouldn't interest you.  Give it a shot!  Be warned, though, this show can be very addictive.  If you're thinking about starting to watch this show on Fox, I would suggest buying the first two seasons on DVD before watching the current season.  I would definitely suggest buying the first two seasons together simply because of the extreme cliffhanger presented on the first season's finale.  I enjoyed being able to start watching the second season's premier immediately!

So much happens in the first season, it is like 2 seasons packed into one. The OC is a great blend of comedy and drama and each character is so complex that they never get boring. Season one features a variety of situations, relationships, and events that were unexpected, funny, and mind-boggling. I highly recommend this set of DVDs and to start at episode 1 and watch in order.",1138320000,2,502,4.467391304347826

It is very well written, the story is not only very entertaining but at times also very poignant. And it has a very real quality to it: it captures late teenage relationships and school life very well.

My favorites in the show are Summer and Seth. Seth Cohen is one hilarious character! The actor that plays him is exceptional. And the cahrachetr of Summer is also outstanding. Although I like the whole cast, these two really stand out and are, in my opinion, what makes the show stand out as an original.

The adults in the series are also very good. I love the wicked and beautiful Mrs Cooper: this character is so dark, OTT and camp. She is a hoot! And I also love the Kirsten and Sandy Cohen husband and wife team: what a great couple. Sandy Cohen in particular is a great male character, full of warmth, integrity and humor. In fact most of the characters in this show are very interesting and exceptionally well drawn out. I really enjoyed this show.

His lawyer Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher) takes him home to his hesitant but caring wife Kirsten (Kelly Rowen) and neurotic and hilarious son Seth (Adam Brody) to give him a second chance in life.

I love The O.C. I watched the first episode and was hooked. The acting was great, the dialogue was great, the characters were interesting and the story kept me entertained. Though the season does stumble a few times (particularly with the whole Oliver scenario), it remains amazing through out.

Pros:

+ Mostly great acting (from Peter Gallagher, Ben McKenzie, Adam Brody, Kelly Rowan, Rachel Bilson, and Melinda Clarke particularly)

+ Great dialogue, very witty and funny (Seth is hilarious)

+ Mostly good storylines

+ Anna Stern (Semair Armstrong, the best guest star so far)

+ Completely amazing music (ie The Killers, Death Cab For Cutie, The Faint, Modest Mouse, U2, etc)

+ One of the best season finales ever

Cons:

- A few lame storylines/guest characters (ie Oliver)

- Some bad acting (Mischa Barton)

- Goes through stories a little too fast, rarely slows things down before a new problem arises

Aside from the few cons The O.C. Season 1 is quality TV. Definitely pick it up. One Tree Hill pales in comparison.

Knowing that the O.C. was not going to be comparable to The West Wing, I still wanted to try it as I read many of the customers' reviews on Amazon, and anyway it's nice to indulge in ""guilty pleasures"" once in a while.

I have watched and loved Felicity, Alias, 24, Friends, so I thought I would give The O.C. a try.

At the beginning of the season, I liked the premise, the acting was good from most actors.  As everyone else I ""fell in love"" with Seth, loved the parents, was curious about Ryan and Marissa....

After the Oliver plot, things started to go downhill.  For one thing the actor playing Ryan was reduced to opening his eyes wide everytime he would see Marissa, or rolling his eyes around when he was annoyed, surprised, in love, in hate, whatever with Marissa.  His expression did not change for 4 or 5 episodes.

Everyone gets along with each other, even if they start off being enemies.  The girls are especially angelic to each other exchanging dresses and niceties, even when feeling jealous......

One of the most interesting characters, Anna, was shipped off, once Seth and Rachel became an item.

Anyway, why go on,  the whole thing just became boring.

I forced myself to watch it until the end, hoping that it would pick up; again.  They did manage to arouse my curiosity in the last episode.  However when I read the plot lines and twists in Season 2, and all the characters they bring in and out, I am sure it's not worth it.  I will not be buying the second season.

And I'm sorry I bought season 1.

The reason I gave it 2 stars is because Seth is very funny, the actors playing Sandy and Kirsten are great, and the show tries once in a while to raise its intelligence quotient by mentioning Pulitzer prize winning books like ""The Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"", which I happen to be reading now.

The plot is basically about the bad guy (Ryan) coming to live with the rich family ( The Cohens) and falling in love with the poor rich girl next door (Marissa). Add in some amazing actors and really funny storylines (and I mean that, all the episodes had me laughing out loud at some point) and you're set to watch the show.

I liked Seth from all the characters, beacuse he was totally funny and I think every teenage guy or girl can relate to. All the episodes are jam-packed, with so much going on! You have to keep your eyes and ears alert at all times, or you might miss something.

The scenery is awesome! All the house are beautiful, and the sea is breathtaking... California looks heavenly :)

The only part I didn't like actually was Marissa - Mischa Barton. She couldn't act as well as the others, when they all seemed natural, she was really faking it. But she gets better in the later episodes.

I gave The O.C 4 stars not because of Marissa though. The supposedly 17 year old ""kids"" do nothing but party and think of partying all day long. They drive to other states to party, and come back past midnight, to wake up to another party. And by party I don't just mean over the top dresses and decoration, but also drugs, sex, fights ; the works. Yes, they do focus on work, real life, and financial problems, but still, it's too much.

While most may dismiss The OC as a nightime soap for young girls it is nothing of the sort. The OC is a show for everyone. I am a 30 year old man and I was hooked from episode one.

We learn that money does not solve all problems and in some cases makes it even worse. This show has it all.

2122660,5,B0002V7TZQ,The O.C is a great show. In Australia we love it the first season started off with Ryan (Benjamin McKenzie) going to live with the Cohens after he steals a car with his brother Trey. Kindhearted lawyer Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher) takes Ryan into his home much to the dismay of his wife Kirsten (Kelly Rowan). Ryan quickly forms a bond with Sandy and Kirstens nerdy but sweet son Seth (Adam Brody) and catches the attention of girl next door Marissa (Mischa Barton) Basically Ryan is everyone that Marissa hasn't known and he is different to everything she knows and has been brought up with brought up by her snobby mother Julie (Melinda Clarke) and troubled but good father Jimmy (Tate Donovan). Marissa seems to have it all popularity is best friends with the social butterfly of the school Summer (Rachel Bilson)who Seth has always been in love with and has the boyfriend every girl at school wants Luke (Chris Carmack) who emidetly takes a disliking to Ryan when he realises that Marissa is attracted to him. Ryan wins Kirsten over early in the season when she finds out that he is a nice kid a classic bad boy with a heart of gold. Throughout the series Ryan falls in love with Marissa and vice versa. Summer begins to fall for Seth much to her horror but once she realises Seth is snabbed by Anna (Samaire Armstrong) now Summer realises for the first time in her life she is going to have to fight for the guy she wants. She is basically a spoild snob who is used to getting everything she wants so she does every to sabotage Annas and Seths relationship which works and she gets Seth. Marissa and Ryan and Summer and Seth are two of the hottest couples on TV today. The DVD season 1 box set is a must have as it has great special features.,1125878400,,1748,4.4485981308411215

2122674,5,B0002V7TZQ,"For someone who had almost given up television altogether, The O.C. was the evil equivalent to a delicious chocolate cake during a diet, tempting me and eventually sucking me right back in.

As a twenty-something year old, I have a lot of fun watching the other twenty-something year olds play high schoolers, balanced off with more scandals that go on with the adults. And to this might I add: it's NOT a teen drama!(for goodness' sake, there's more adults in this than teens) So anyone over 20, don't be intimidated or feel silly watching this show; it's great!

Much wittier, funnier and enticing than 90210, Felicity, Dawson's Creek or any of those shows that it gets compared to. And with a much cuter cast too. I've already gotten so many of my friends hooked!!!",1125014400,2,768,4.723880597014926
2122675,5,B0002V7TZQ,"A large majority of my friends watched The O.C. and told me it was one of the greatest teen dramas to ever hit television. According to them, I haven't seen anything until I've seen The O.C. I wasn't sure if I would like it, as I didn't really like the idea of watching the lives of rich and gorgeous kids, but I decided to try it out and see if I liked it. I picked the DVD up [...], not knowing what I was in for. To my surprise, all twenty-seven episodes of the first season just blew me away. From the very first episode, I fell in love with The O.C. and couldn't stop watching to see what would happen next. It wasn't long before The O.C. became one of my top ten favorite shows.

I have to admit that at first, I hated a majority of the characters. Some characters like Summer (the gorgeous Rachel Bilson) and Julie (the sassy Melinda Clarke) were just too mean for my liking. Fortunately, as the show went on, every character that I didn't like grew on me, eventually leading to there not being a single character that I wanted killed off. And even though nobody likes a town of rich and beautiful people, there's a good supply of poor characters, and I wouldn't call any character's lives perfect. Infact, I found myself feeling sorry for certain rich characters that could buy whatever they wanted. This just shows that money can't buy happiness.

In addition to well-written characters, the actors who played them were also fantastic. Chris Carmack did a great job playing the idiotic school [...], Rachel Bilson played the perfect school [...], and Adam Brody was excellent at playing my personal favorite character, geeky Seth. Not only are the starring characters great, but so are the recurring characters with their wonderful plotlines. There's the creepy, mysterious, and destructive Oliver; Holly, the girl you thought was a good friend; and then of course, Teresa, the sexy girl next door. If the characters weren't good enough, there's also the crazy couples you'll have a fun-time shipping. Adult and teenager relationship, anyone?

I'm so glad that I followed my friends' wishes to watch The O.C. There are many teen dramas out there today, but a great majority of them are terrible--but The O.C. stands out in the crowd. If you're the kind of person that enjoys watching teenagers' dramatic lives, and you haven't already started watching The O.C., either save up money to buy the first season on DVD, borrow it from a friend, or start watching it on TV. Anything. The classic plots and characters will have you entertained for hours. Trust me, you'll have a blast watching. And as Luke says in the first episode, ""Welcome to The O.C.

2122677,5,B0002V7TZQ,"Well, I must admit when I first heard about the series, I was skeptical. It seemed to popular to be any good. However, during a severe bout of flu during which time I was glued to my couch I found myself glued also the boxset my girlfriend had. And so I watched the first 27 episodes in 48 hours curled up with lots of blankets. I couldn't stop watching as Ryan, the angry and outlandish teen, fumbled through Newport society in the first few episodes, but who was soon smoother than Seth. Every nuance of the show was original and fun and always filled with best music! The O.C. soundtracks are some of my favorite! I love being able to listen to some of my favorite music and remember funny moments that it played in during the show. All the charachters are different and fun, plus it's nice that you really get to see the kids and the parents throughout the show. Sometimes my mom watches with me, and while she's not as enthusiastic as my little brother, she certainly showed interest. I would highly recommend the first season to everyone, even the sceptics out there. The O.C. is a great show, and it's even more fun watching it the second time!",1123891200,,1151,4.433962264150943
2122678,5,B0002V7TZQ,"When ""The OC"" premiered in August 2003,I was instantly capitivated. The previews showed off this gorgeous town,great music and fresh characters-and the debut did not disappoint.
At long last,here was THE show for young viewers. Sorry,but teenagers,(and twenty-somethings)don't want to see ""Law and Order"" or ""NYPD Blue"".Unfortunately,the show was instantly labeled as a ""90210"" ripoff by cynics. This could not be further from the truth. In addition to Beverly Hills being VERY different from Newport Beach,""90210""'s characters had no depth,no wit,and did nothing but sulk. Furthermore,the men,(who ripped off James Dean)were plastic Ken dolls and never uttered anything of interest.(Except ""bro"".)
Not here!""The OC""'s characters,particularly the men,are very witty and their lines are funny and very sharp. Also,the show does a BRILLIANT job of NOT taking itself seriously. People who nit-pick it need to relax and get real! More often than not,the show is very light-hearted and funnier than any comedy around.
You wouldn't know that from the first few episodes,though. Early on,there's plenty of grit as you learn about Ryan's tumultuous backround. The writers did a superb job of deliberately explaining the complexity of his character,as well as explaining why the Cohen's have adopted him.
Once everything settles,things get even better. Ryan and Seth gel perfectly,as if they've always been brothers. It's just staggering how well they complement each other. Sandy and Kirsten are THE coolest parents EVER!But wait,there's more. Like Seth's(distant)dream girl Summer,who's best friends with Marissa,the troubled girl next door,her penthouse-to-outhouse father Jimmy,and(sometimes)ominous mother Julie. Marissa's(initial)boyfriend Luke,is another major character who does not take kindly to Ryan's arrival in Newport.(By the way,this show has the most awesome,realistic punches and fights ever witnessed outside of a ring.)
As the season progresses,the characters develop and mature considerably. Ryan cools down,Seth gets cool,rivalries and cliques disintegrate,and great new characters enter the fray.(Anna,Sandy's co-worker Rachel,Kirsten's sister Hailey,Kirsten's fruitful father Caleb,etc.)But just when things appear almost melodramatic,the baddest character is introduced...
OLIVER!The psychotic,unstable,slick,disingenuous hedonist who shakes EVERYTHING up! After he meets Marissa in therapy,all hell breaks loose! I won't say what happens,but it was the most realistic,fascinating story I've ever seen unfold on television. A chilling look inside the mind of a psycho.
Several standout episodes follow,like the superb Valentine's day episode ""The Heartbreak"",""The Telenovela""(my personal favorite), and Anna's final episode,""The Goodbye Girl"".It would be impossible to summarize every storyline and episode,simply because virtually no scene lasts more than 90 seconds. Indeed,the show is very fast-paced and a ton happens in season one. So many stories,so many characters come and go. Perhaps this explains why the second season was a bit of a slow-paced disappointment.
In terms of extras and general layout,this seven-disc set is also top-notch. The orange cover art looks great,there's a character on every disc,and it's very user-friendly. The picture and sound quality are superb,and everything seems just perfect.(Like the show!)There's plenty of extras too. Cast interviews,pilot commentary by creator Josh Schwartz,music guides,deleted scenes and various featurettes.
It's just great to see that cool,fresh,smart,original and entertaining shows are still around.""The OC"" exemplifies all of the aforementioned qualities,and then some. I can't imagine anyone watching this show and not loving it. It's paradise in every sense of the word. This is just the perfect set...and the perfect tv show!!!",1123804800,,3817,6.083487940630798

2122702,5,B0002V7TZQ,"I haven't yet purchased any O.C. item available quite yet. But just take this review into your mind. I never was a big OC fan until my brother decided it's time I started watching more shows and not just Gilmore Girls. I then watched one of the episodes airing upon FOX television, I watched it and I was sad to see that episode end. Afterwards I thanked my brother for deciding to tape me The OC and I suggested to set the next two episodes to tape upon our DVR. Thankfully, the next two episodes taped. Unluckily, my sister deleted it away from our DVR, and without getting any pleasure out of seeing the episode. However, another thankful moment occured, by the fact that she only deleted the first episode and not the other one. I watched that one in awe hoping to find something much more interesting in this episode, which I did. I found another interaction with Seth and Summer (love them two together.) the spider-man comment was just adorable and random, and at first, I didn't quite understand why Summer was so angry at Seth, what ever did he do wrong? I then figured out during that episode, they used to be a couple as well, but Seth backed out on the relationship, sadly.

I then continued watching this episode as Marissa discovers her best friend turns into her girlfriend, indulging through a relationship, tells her mother, decides to move away from home and live with her girlfriend, then realizes that this may be a mistake, left outside in the rain with her ex-boyfriend, Ryan.

Now, surprisingly, I laughed and was in shock as Mischa Barton played a lesbian, well, bisexual, as I've known her from television, and my sister's short obsession.

Moving on, I then watched Ryan go through the blood test with his  new girlfriend, and how she discovers who her true father is. That was another great part during this episode.

Now, I realize this episode may or may not be in the 1st or 2nd season, however, it made me realize this is a teen soap that certainly never gets boring. It's always amusing.

Now, I may skip forward onto the grand finale, THE KISS. Summer and Seth were meant to be. No doubt about that. But when Summer finally realized that, they all played a Spider-Man move. As Summer ran through the storm into Seth's house, calling out his name, as then she discovers Seth is asking for help as he's hanging off of the roof of his house, Summer comes running outside as Seth asked what she is doing here. Summer smerks and answers, ""Why else?"", she softly pulled down the Spider-Man mask off til his lips exposed, it's then she kissed his lips. I couldn't have asked for a better ending for that episode.

I think that this DVD will give us more and more pleasure during every episode. I certainly will buy every DVD after I purchase the last two Gilmore Girls DVD.

I was just giving you guys an example of a few episodes, I hope you'll all enjoy this DVD as much as I know I will.

Purchase it as soon as possible. Thank you for reading.",1121040000,2,2973,4.4907407407407405

2122704,5,B0002V7TZQ,"In my opinion, we are living in the new Golden Age of television. The reasons are twofold: a sharp increase in the quality of television writing and improved means of viewing series thanks to both high definition television and DVDs. The quality of writing is not just a result of a new generation of highly talented writers hitting the scene, but a tremendous broadening of what writers are able to achieve in the medium. Before shows like HILL STREET BLUES began breaking down the stand-alone episode format that had dominated television for decades, allowing a degree of character of development and a narrative complexity not previously possible, writers were saddled with concocting stories that had to be contained entirely within a 40 or 20 minute show. But beginning in the late 1980s and especially after shows like THE X-FILES, plots began breaking out of the 40 minute strait-jacket and an individual episode started picking up plot details from earlier shows, more often than not leaving much to be explained in future episodes. Though series like LAW AND ORDER and CSI continue to work with the earlier format, more shows than not now exult in the freedom of story arcs that carry over long stretches of seasons, juggling two or three or more narratives at once.

Of all the genres exploiting the new freedom given television writers, my least favorite has always been the teen or adult soap opera. I found all of Aaron Spelling's shows to be fairly unwatchable and was left cold by DAWSON'S CREEK.  Despite this, I find THE O.C. to be a delightful exception to this role. What sets this series apart from its competitors is the sharp intelligence of the writing, a first rate cast that spans a wide range of ages, an unwillingness to pander in cheap pathos, and a mildly self-ironic stance towards the genre to which it belongs. The show manages to be genuinely funny, emotionally involving, and surprisingly moral all at the same time. I'm sometimes suspicious of why some people like it, but if some like it for the wrong reasons, there are plenty of very good reasons to like it.

The most immediate reason for liking the show is the absolutely first-rate cast. Benjamin McKenzie made an immediate splash on the show as Ryan Atwood, a good kid from Chino caught in a bad situation. Physically he bears a striking resemblance to Russell Crowe, a fact that received much mention when the show debuted and even commented on in one episode. Ryan and his date have returned from seeing MASTER AND COMMANDER, and looking him full in the eye says that she doesn't understand why anyone thinks that Russell Crowe is handsome. Of course, the audience is in on the joke. Ryan is befriended by the idealistic Sandy Cohen, a New Yorker who in his youth was much like Ryan. He brings Ryan home to his upper class home in a Malibu-like community, and almost by accident he, his wife, and son become Ryan's new foster home. Peter Gallagher, an actor I've rarely liked in the past, is absolutely outstanding as Sandy, and makes him my favorite character on the show. Through the first two seasons Sandy acts as the moral center of the show, so completely driven by his principles that at times even his familial relations are sometimes threatened by them. But his compassion and determination to do what is right are downright inspirational. He is one of the rare truly good characters on television. Kelly Rowan is superb as Sandy's wife Kirsten, and Adam Brody is even better as their son Seth. One of the great cool nerds on TV, Seth also exhibits perhaps the best taste in culture on TV (how often do truly great cultural figures like Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Frank Miller, the Shins, Modest Mouse, and their ilk get mentioned on prime time?). Together Ryan, Sandy, Kirsten, and Seth make one of the most compelling families on TV. And women! No prime time television show would be complete without gorgeous women, and THE O.C. is no exception. Mischa Barton is not just a pretty face, though she is at least that. Tall, lithe, and blessed with the looks of a beautiful fashion model, she plays Marisa, more or less Ryan's love interest on the show. She is a good enough actress that she manages to make her character more interesting than equivalent characters on other shows, and the writers give her more opportunity to shine by making Marisa an individual who struggle more than most in coping with her problems. In the first two seasons of the show, she has struggled with alcohol, drugs, and sexual experimentation, and managing to be profoundly unhappy through it all. Equally interesting is Rachel Bilson as Summer, a cute but ultra-self-absorbed teen who could have been a one-dimensional character similar to Cordelia Chase in the first three seasons of BUFFY, but instead quickly develops into a more complex and interesting character (much as Cordelia did once she shifted to ANGEL) who has an inexplicable attraction to Seth (again, much as Cordelia was to Xander). To add to the BUFFY connection, the first time I saw Rachel Bilson was in the great Season Seven episode of BUFFY called ""Dirty Girls,"" in which she plays (along with another Potential Slayer) a brief though memorable part as the object of a very funny sexual fantasy on the part of Xander. Summer is a great example of the way that the writers resist turning roles into stock characters. There are also a string of excellent performers in smaller roles, including Samaire Armstrong as Anna Stern, a competitor for Summer for Seth's attentions, and Navi Rowat, Ryan's ex-girlfriend.

I'm less thrilled by Melinda Clarke as Julie Cooper-Nichol, Marissa's mother and a character who would seem more at home on DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES than THE O.C. This is typical of a larger problem: the show doesn't do nearly as good with unsympathetic characters as with sympathetic ones. If we are supposed to love them, we generally do, but if we are supposed to hate them, we do because they simply aren't likable. Instead of being great bad characters, they only manage to be off putting. Over two seasons I have failed to like Alan Dale as Kirsten's father, and Taylor Handley as the troubled and manipulative and utterly unbelievable Oliver Trask was positively awful. This is all a bit odd because many of the most memorable characters on TV have been evil or at least kind of bad. But THE O.C. has yet to produce a single excellent bad character. Perhaps that will be a project for Season Three.

My friend Tracy pointed out one other great virtue of the show to me. She noted that unlike most other series with strong teen elements, the adult story lines are at least as good. Stories involving Sandy or Kirsten or other adults are not mere throw ins, but fully equal to the kid story lines. I think this is in part responsible for the narrative richness of the show. It is not just a show for the kiddies.

As much as I have loved this show, there is still the problem with the genre. I mentioned that I don't like teen and adult soap operas, and part of the reason lies in the difficulty such shows have in sustaining narratives. A show like VERONICA MARS or BUFFY or LOST, where large-scale stories provide the framework for all of the narrative elements, have a huge advantage over a show like THE O.C. In these shows there is a sense of a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Veronica Mars in that show's first season was both trying to solve the mystery of the death of her best friend and exonerate her father from a series of false accusations. In Season Five of Buffy our heroine was attempting to confront a hell goddess bent upon killing her sister. In both of these instances the plot gave the series a unity that THE O.C. always lacks. Instead it consists of a host of smaller stories; good stories, but a multiplicity of smaller narratives that are not terribly unified. In the end, that is the only thing that keeps THE O.C. from rivaling my favorite series, the inability to tell a Big Story.

Nonetheless, THE O.C. is an exceptionally well-done series with a group of characters that are exceptionally easy to like. The first season was very good, the second season perhaps even better, and this leaves me looking very much forward to the third season.",1120867200,3,8253,4.727083333333334

2122707,3,B0002V7TZQ,"This series appeared in my video store and I got hooked after Volume I.  Somewhere along the way, the experience was like eating ice cream...addictive and pleasurable, but ultimately a sugar high.

  O.C. is, alas, limited by the restrictions of network TV. In one Special Feature, the producers explain that they can't even let the kids smoke.  Meanwhile the ghost of Tony Soprano hovers over each episode.  I keep comparing O.C. to non-network shows like Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Dead Like Me, and Sex and the City.

You know you're on network TV because everybody's NICE.  Just about every episode includes (a) at least one heart-felt apology and (b) at least one encounter beginning, ""We need to talk.""  Do teenage boys really talk about feelings?  Does anybody?  In six seasons of Sex and the City, did anyone ever say Let's Talk?  Did we feel something was missing?

The series opens with a strong premise.  Good kid ""Ryan Atwood"" gets rescued from tough circumstances. Who wouldn't want to rescue Ben Mackenzie? He's adorable -- that quirky smile and The Look.

But for a certified Bad Boy, he doesn't have enough rough edges.  He gets one lesson in tie-tying and now he's a socialite! He speaks smoothly and apologizes for saying words that are allowed on network television.  Okay, he hits people when he gets mad, but so does his nemesis, Luke, a certified Rich Kid.  So does a grown man who just lost his life savings.

Ryan faces the classic teenage rivalry -- fighting for his girl against Luke, athletic champ and bully (except in Newport, the tough-guy sport is -- water polo? gimme a break).  Ryan soon discovers a big secret that's almost too appropriate to Luke and his father.  Ah, some edge! Alas, Luke soon joins forces with Ryan to help Marissa and becomes another teddy bear.

Kirsten's sister has potential as an edgy character, almost too reminiscent of Janice in The Sopranos and Ruth Fisher's sister in Six Feet Under.  When the boys discover she's working as a stripper (after telling everyone she's got a ""normal"" job teaching yoga for Club Med) -- well, Tony Soprano and the Fishers would say, ""Good for her!""  Here, she's ""rescued.""

Meanwhile, the high school kids (who look and act more like twenty-somethings) are left alone to deal with crises that would baffle many over-35 adults.

The Cohens invite Ryan, ""Come to us when you're in trouble.""  But on Thanksgiving Day, Ryan announces plans to visit his big brother in a maximum security prison. ""Do you want us to go with you?"" the Cohen parents ask politely.

Um...you're letting a troubled high school junior visit an inmate in a max security prison - and you don't insist on going along? And you wonder why Ryan feels he has to fight his own battles?

Meanwhile, Seth lies about visiting Mexico and claims the car got vandalized in a movie parking lot.  The only parental expression comes from the mom Kirsten who promises they'll have to Talk.

This IS Southern California: isn't everyone supposed to have a therapist on call?  Ryan gets dumped into his new world, after only a short test by the formidable ""Dr. Kim,"" who seems to be the only official at this posh school (and a rather unethical official at that).

The day after the teens witness an attempted suicide by gunshot, they're sent back to school as if nothing happened.  Even Claire Fisher (from Six Feet Under) got sent to a school counselor in her public school. Only Marissa sees a shrink - way overdue! - and she balks.  Wouldn't half the school be in therapy and proud of it - not to mention the Ladies at the Club?

Some scenes are so unrealistic it's like watching snow In July in South Florida.  In one episode, Kirsten burns toast, setting off a clanging bell.  Doesn't this mansion have an alarm system with monitoring?  When the fire alarm goes off, you stop expressing angst and head for the keypad. Or you face a bunch of firemen, smirking because you'll have to pay a big fat fine for a false alarm.

Other mysteries: Who cleans the mansion? We saw one servant in the Pilot - but they need a team.  How does Kirsten have time for grocery shopping (or picking up take-out)? Can't they call to have food delivered or hire a cook?

And in the elite Harbor School, nobody seems to have much homework. Don't they compete for grades? Talk about grades? Hang out together in cliques?

But...I was hooked! I didn't want to stop watching, even when I started making notes for this review. ""Nauseating."" ""Predictable."" ""Could be an NBC sitcom from twenty years ago.""  I fast-forwarded through some teen romance scenes - but there was always another episode waiting.

Is it the show...or am I just experiencing Sopranos withdrawal?  After a few rounds of moist-eyed apologies and ""talk to me,"" I'm ready for someone to get whacked.  Or at least do something wrong and not  apologize.  Ah, what HBO could do with this material...",1120521600,4,4886,4.718676122931442

And let me tell you, they were painful. Who is stupid enough to buy into this crap? Mischa barton is the worst. Her little ""acting"" is pathetic. My mute grandma could do better.

As I began to watch the show, I noticed it was a soap opera type program. I realized that I was a guy, and guys don't watch soap operas. But now, I take that back. Yes, this show can be linked as a type of soap opera, but what The O.C. is can't be compared to anything else I've viewed on television before. It is a program that is simply addicting once you watch it. The characters, the drama, the events, the twists, etc. make this show the best show on television in my opinion.

Creator, Josh Schwartz has did a magnificant job creating a story that is compelling and filled with drama. The characters are believable, which is the most important aspect in a program. The setting for this series, in Newport Beach, California is probably one of the most beautiful places out there. The O.C. captures the beauty of Newport, as well as some things that go on that make it seem like it's not the perfect place.

The main character, Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie), is from Chino. Chino does not have any comparison whatsoever to Newport except that they are in the same state. Ryan survives an arrest and seeks the help of his lawyer, Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher). When Sandy invites Ryan into his home, the family realizes that things will not be the same in this town again. But, Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) finds a liking to Ryan, and sees him as a brother he never had. Throughout the season, the bond between Ryan and Seth grows into basically a true friendship. Ryan immediately catches the eye of the girl next door, Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and the tension builds throughout the season between the two which sends the viewers for a magnificant dramatic ride.

What makes this show amazing is the basic concepts that we as human beings can relate to. When watching the show, you'll be saying ""Hey, that has happened to me before!"" over and over again. Now, it's possible you might not have experienced as much chaos as these families go through, but can relate nonetheless. All in all, this show is aimed at teens, but adults can love it as well. Any fan of dramatic television will love The O.C. . Also, look for the second season coming out in late August.",1116979200,3,2344,4.495305164319249

2122726,5,B0002V7TZQ,"California here we come! ""The OC"" is my favourite TV show ever! It is romantic, dramatic, hot, and halarious. It's one of those shows that you don't expect to be original, but nevertheless you're drawn in and each episode leaves you hungry for more!

""The OC"" is the abrieviation for Orange County, and is set in Newport, the wealthiest, sunniest, most desirable place in California, full of spoilt rich kids. Ryan Atwood (played by newcomer Benjamin McKenzie) does not have these luxeries, let alone a home when he is kicked out of his house in his run-down town of Chino. A rebel, lost-hope and placed on probabtion, he is taken in by his lawyer Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher from ""American Beauty""), who invites him into his family of his wife, Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) and their geeky, shy, comic-book obsessed son Seth (Adam Brody). A misfit in the world of money, designer outfits and flip-phones, Ryan has trouble fitting in with the spoilt, bratty popular group that give him grief... (to which he fights back by punching them!) But on his immediate arrival, sparks fly between Ryan and the beautiful Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), and thus, ""The OC"" begins! Seth's crush on the feisty brunette Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson), dramatic love trapeziums, a crazed phsycopath, a car crash, a house fire, a drug-over dose, a blast from the past, a wedding, a divorce, a bank-ruptsy, a pregnancy, a Paris Hitlon cameo AND believe it or not SCHOOL are just some of the storylines that are visited in this 26-part series!

The chemistry between the major love items (Ryan and Marissa and Seth and Summer) is extremely strong, which is important in a show that bases its stories around their relationships. The episodes mix dramatic action with halarious scenes with fantastic one-liners. Seth and Summer are particularly entertaining!

The clothes the characters wear are gorgeous, and certainly makes you envious of these stinkin rich 17-year-olds! The music is... WOW! Music plays a huge role in the series, to the point when its essentially a character in itself. The show melds mellow rock with punk, pop and hip hop and all the songs have fantastic melodies! Brilliant soundtracks!

Finally the season's emotional season finale makes you eager for the next installment. I cried for about fifteen minutes AFTER the finale!

Ofcourse, ""The OC"" is nothing we haven't had before! Teenaged angst, relationships, marital issues and trend-setting fashions are just some of the elements that are both predictable, yet totally addictive! This show is brilliant! Fun, witty, suspensful and hot!, ""The OC"" has made internationally famous the names of Ryan, Marissa, Seth and Summer; and makes you want to scream ""CALIFORNIAAAA!"" at the top of your lungs!",1116720000,,2746,5.052980132450331
2122727,5,B0002V7TZQ,"During the summer of 2003, it was impossible to turn on the Fox network and not be barraged by a promo for this show. Naturally, I was skeptical. It looked like another random and predictable teen drama. Once the show debuted, I heard so many good things about it, but it wasn't until the cotillion episode I finally sat down and gave it a chance.

This isn't just the smartest teen soap opera in years; it is one of the smartest period. Out of the 27 first season episodes, there is not a weak one in the bunch. This is all due to the excellent writing, but mostly it is because of the ensemble cast. The parents and teens interact rather than never communicate like on some shows, and in some cases the parents have more interesting stories. In fact, Sandy, Kirsten, and Julie Cooper-the show's chief troublemaker-are my favorite characters. All the characters are very well-developed, which is a welcome surprise for a show like this. What also works well is how the show never seems to take itself seriously. This self-deprecation and flair for comedy is most apparent in the Thanksgiving episode, which is my all-time favorite episode simply because it is where the Summer/Seth/Anna triangle turns into classic screwball romantic comedy material. To me, that is the big appeal of the show. Even when most of the characters are screaming, crying, or brooding, you know something funny will happen next to lighten the mood.

If you think you won't like this show, you would be surprised. I got this set last week and my family has ended up watching it more than I have! Many people who have made fun of me for watching this show have asked to borrow it when I am finished. If you haven't yet watched it, get it now and get caught up just in time for Season 2's release in August.",1116201600,3,1782,4.565625

I started to watch the 2nd season on tv then realized i had to buy the oc season 1. I've been obsessed with the oc ever since. i am in LOVE adam brody(seth) and also find summer hillarious. The show is basically about a troubled outsider ryan who movies to orange county. There is TONS of drama and it is very addictive. The 2nd season is good but nothing could ever beat the 1st.

2122747,5,B0002V7TZQ,"The O.C. was a phenomenon from the first airing of the pilot episode not because of the hot actors, the wealthy lifestyle, or the amazing fashions, this show is a hit because it's real. Under its glittering surface lies a show of truth, pin-pointing the real emotions of real people. Those who say money will buy you happiness hasn't watched The O.C. The plot twist don't seem forced or thrown together, and the storyline is 100% relatable no matter how old you are or what ""social class"" you belong to. From the simplicity of a first crush to the extremeness of Alcohol addiction and divorce this show has touched the hearts of millions because its a show of meaning.  What I love most about the show is that the adults aren't there just to be there, they aren't authority figures that only show up when one of the kid's crazy schemes goes wrong and they get into trouble. Sometimes you become more entralled with the adults story plot than the lead teen characters'. So much more than a ""teen drama"", The O.C. is on a much higher level than Dawson's Creek, One Tree Hill or any other WB tween show because it will never try to fool you with over the top drama that's just recycled from the same predictable formula that's been used time and time again.

2122753,5,B0002V7TZQ,"It was around February 2004 when The O.C first aired in England and it drew comparisons to Dawsons Creek so I thought i'd check it out, anyway after recording the first 4 episodes without watching them I decided to sit down one Monday night and watch one or two of the episodes just to see if it was any good and what do you know it was great, from the pilot where the characters were introduced and brilliantly developed to the fourth episode where the gang went to catillion i was hooked and couldn't wait till Sunday when the next episode was on.
Anyway i'm not going to give a synopsis of the show as most people know what it is about and some of the other reviewers have done so but what I will do however is state that it is the best show on tv with good characters, a clever and witty script and all the glamour and nice locations you would expect from the Americans. What sets this show apart from the likes of Dawsons Creek and One Tree Hill is that it doesn't take itself as seriously as the other two and it is light hearted good quality entertainment that doesn't require you to have read a dictionary (Dawsons creek uses some of the longest and most complex words I have ever heard from teenagers) but isn't a proverbial no brainer. The best character on the show is Seth Cohen, his development, from an awkward, nerdy loner to having friends and dating the girl of his dreams(Summer), is an engaging and hilarious journey that shows his rapier wit to it's very best and has since become probably my favourite character from any tv show ever(Perhaps tied with Tony Soprano). The DVD box set is well put together with some decent extras and although some Americans have complained about the extras, the English usually get poor extras so the extras seem quite good. To conclude if you are after a show that is hugely intelligent and not so much fun then this may not be for you(Dawsons creek would be your thing) but if the are looking for a funny, intelligent and cool programme with one of the best soundtracks around then don't hesitate to buy this because if you are looking for the above then you won't be disappointed.",1107129600,6,2136,4.43765903307888
2122754,4,B0002V7TZQ,"Look, it's hard to review a DVD collection because, if you're interested in buying it at all, you've probably seen the show.  For that reason, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the show because lets face it, if you haven't seen the show, I doubt your going to spend $50 on my word alone.

I will say that I'm a huge fan of the show and, for that reason, I was not disappointed.  I don't watch the ""Oliver"" period that much but otherwise it was a very enjoyable season.  Also, it bears mentioning that the O.C.'s first season was 27 episodes, not 22 like normal shows, so you get quite a bit for your money.

All that said, what I will review are the extras, which is probably all I can give you that will help you with your decision.

Pilot Commentary - Interesting but I didn't learn much that was new.  This was probably the best of the extras though and it did show how much respect the producers have for the stars.

Cut Scenes - They were cut for a reason, not that they're bad but it's not the Holy Grail for O.C. fans either.

Casting the O.C. - They cast these people because they...uh...thought they were good (except for Adam Brody who they didn't think was good, but then they saw everyone else, and found that he was in fact good)

Music Track Special and subtitled episodes - I'm as happy as anyone that the O.C. has a great musical director and that she gets some screen time on the DVD but I didn't learn much here.  She's great, the music she picks is great, I agree with both those statements but 12 minutes to say that is a tad excessive.

Inside the real OC - Pretty worthless, McG gets a bunch of O.C. teenagers together and asks them what they think of the show.  They think it's cool!  That's pretty much it.

Season 2 sneek peak - Worthless, both because we're already well in to Season 2 and because it's just the commercial they played 800 times on TV.

That's about it, if you enjoyed the show enough to want to watch it again, buy the DVD.  But if your considering it for the extras, save your money.  `nuff said.",1106956800,2,2046,4.229381443298969
2122755,4,B0002V7TZQ,"There are plenty of reviews on here that espouse the greatness of The OC.  All which are true but buying a TV show's DVDs are usually for those hard core fans who just can't get enough of the weekly drama and need to have their own copies of the show so they can relive Marissa and Ryan's first kiss and Seth's obsession with Summer.  More importantly, DVDs are for the EXTRA's.  The best of the extras are the unaired scenes with the creator Josh Swartz explaining why each scene ended up on the cutting room floor (answer TIME).  It's cool seeing Sandy and Kristen discuss who their favorite Golden Girl is and some lines that ended up being cut because of Janetgate.  The featurette of how they casted each character was interesting but was basically just the casting director sitting there talking.  No interesting casting reels.  The rest of the extras were pretty weak.  I'm still having trouble figuring out what the music guide is all about? And the only commentary is on the pilot which sounds literally like Josh Swartz phoned it in.  His voice is soft and producer Stephanie's is much louder making it almost impossible to understand what he is saying.  Therefore you are constantly turning up the volume to hear him and then being blasted by Stephanie's voice.  The Season 2 sneak peak is a total joke.  It's basically the cast saying what they would ""like to happen"".  Overall the ""special features"" aren't all that special if you are hoping for something good.  But if all you care about is being able to watch 27 fabulous drama filled episodes then this is the DVD for you.  The best part is you can pause the scenes of shirtless Ryan and Seth lounging in the pool.",1106870400,3,1680,4.590604026845638
2122756,3,B0002V7TZQ,"I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could.  It's a funny show and a lot better than I thought it would be (I bought the DVD basically because of all the hype I've heard from the critics).

Of course like everyone says, Adam Brody is hilarious but at times I found he was a bit too...big, as his character, Seth, put it to describe someone else on the show.  I enjoy the familial relationships on the show between Seth and Ryan, the Cohens, Sandy and Kirsten, Jimmy and...well everyone.  Gotta love Tate Donovan and he's finally got a show that might actually  make it past Season 2.

Melinda Clarke is great as Julie, the classic soap diva and Peter Gallagher (definitely my favorite on the show) is even funnier at times than his on-screen son.  Rachel Bilson is cute and actually believable as the shallow but still down-to-earth Summer.  Mischa Barton is probably the only casting mistake on the show as she is given the heaviest stories but unfortunately can't act to save her life.

The writing is best when dealing with dialogue and has some of the wittiest deliveries on TV though it's clear that most of the O.C. slang was inspired by Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Kudos to Josh Swartchz, and other writers such as Jane Espenson (of Buffy), Erica Messer and Debra Fisher (of Arrested Development).

The only  thing about this show is that it's just smart enough to skirt the line between a satirical mocking of sappy teen dramas and becoming a sappy teen drama and as many shows stumble and fall in their sophomore year, I can see that easily happening to the O.C. especially if they continue with more outlandish teen-driven plots and marginalize the ""old people"".

Notable episodes:

The Goodbye Girl - the final scenes (esp. with Seth and Anna) were probably some of the best in the season

The Strip - a bit hokey with the poker game but for some reason Julie's almost disturbing need for male strippers made me laugh out loud

The L.A. - a cute and clever self-parody with the ""soap within a soap""",1106697600,2,2000,4.575842696629214

2122760,5,B0002V7TZQ,"""California here we come, right back where we started from, California, California, here we come...!"" sings Phantom Planet as the opening credits play for Fox's hit teen drama The OC. I can't help but feel a tinge of excitement and anticipation as I eagerly wait for the episode to begin. But wait, there's no commercials, no sudden breaking news, and after it's done the theme song starts once again introducing a new episode. I can obsess over the OC on my couch whenever I want, because I am watching the OC Complete First Season DVD Collection.

  The OC's pilot episode aired way back on July 5th, 2003, to kick off Fox's new idea of a summer season, and was an instant success. It was in the premiere that we met troubled youth Ryan (Benjamin Mackenzie) who was taken in by the Cohen family, where Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher) just happened to be his lawyer. There he meets his best friend-to-be Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) and beautiful girl-next-door Marissa (Mischa Barton). From then on, The OC hits pretty much any form of teenage drama you can possibly imagine, although sometimes a little out there, from teen pregnancy to a drug overdose to losing virginity. Don't forget the issues of the adults, however, who deal with divorce, white-collar scandals, and everybody dating each other.

  Now, I have to admit, as an OC-aholic, asking for The Complete First Season for Christmas only seemed natural. And thank God that I got it! Rarely ever am I let down by an episode, and, yes, I know my fixation may seem strange. But trust me, the DVD collection won't let you down. Because I have seen every episode aired to date, I have to say that I believe that the acting is surprisingly great, the plot lines forever intriguing, and the music simply irresistible. With new twists and turns every week of the first season, OC fans kept coming back for more, even throwing their own OC parties every Wednesday nights at 8pm. Not that I ever did that...

  And now it's finally here: all the episodes you loved and lusted over all in one delightfully colored package. The box set includes seven disks of the episodes, with about 5 episodes per disk. On the final DVD there are special features, which consist of deleted scenes with commentary, a meet and greet with kids of the real Orange County, and sections about the music selection and casting. The deleted scenes are, well... for a couple you definitely tell why they were taken out of the final episodes. Just see for yourself. The portion where you meet true products of Newport is the only let down; I found the host to be extremely annoying and the interviewees possibly even more obnoxious. It makes me happy the characters of the TV show don't have personalities like them. The segments about music selection and casting were by far the most interesting features, and my eyes were glued to the screen. I had always wondered how they found someone as witty as Adam Brody and as gorgeous as Mischa Barton. In addition, the music selector for the show gave me an inside look to choosing songs to fit a specific scene. How interesting! (And no, I'm not being sarcastic.)

  Eager to go out and check out this amazing drama for yourself? Be sure to get the Complete First Season and catch up on OC history while you follow the second season, which now airs Thursdays on Fox at 7pm. The box set will set you back at least $40 depending on where you buy it but is worth every penny. Get ready for some Seth Cohen humor and dramatically elegant parties and travel all the way from your own home to The OC by heading to your favorite retail store. Can you imagine it: watching nothing but The OC for hours and hours without end...sigh...",1104710400,3,3691,4.6183206106870225

2122762,5,B0002V7TZQ,"This series is something that is extremely overrated, but is worth watching because it contains some of the best storylines and some of the best acting. This series shows how the more ""well-off"" people live their lives...and that they are just as miserable and going through the same problems as any other person on this planet. That's what i really liked about this series..and much as people say that this it is unrealistic..IT IS REALISTIC. I live in Orange County, and yes, there are some social groups who are exactly like this cast.

In season one; so much happens. It's a bit overwhleming,  but that makes it all the more watchable. I've got to admit that this series is pretty addictive. And unlike other shows, this includes the adults into plotlines and not just the teenagers.

So, this show may be highly overrated, but it is worth watching because it has some of the most relatable and realistic storylines, and with some of the best acting.

DVD EXTRAS INCLUDES: AWESOME featurettes about casting, and behind-the-scene look at the way a episode is created and background on the cast (was previously aired on television before the second season).

Also includes unaired scenes to serveral episodes and a gag reel.",1104624000,2,1226,4.875

You can watch the episodes over and over again, and they are great every single time. I love the saga of Ryan and Marissa, and the humor from Sandy and Seth. The adult stories are interesting, unlike lots of shows when you just want to see the kids. You get sucked into it while you are watching it, and drop everything to watch it all day long. The extra features were great, and I loved watching the commentary on the pilot. I only wish they had commentary on more episodes. This is totally worth the money, and you will love The O.C.",1104537600,,709,4.182481751824818
2122764,5,B0002V7TZQ,"First off, the OC is apropriate for the youngest viewing age of 12, however it is probably most appreciated by kids between 14-18.

~The OC is an overall great show. My friend brought the First season over for a New Year's Eve sleepover, and I stayed up until 8am watching it. Everyone kept telling me about the Oc, but I only saw 1 random episode and the season finale episode out of the first season. I wasn't that into it at first. It's better if you see it from the beginning. Ryan, the main character, is great not because of how he looks but, how he acts. Ryan was arrested because of something his brother told him to help him do. Ryan knew it was wrong and didn't want to do it...Ryans's dad is in jail, his mom's a drunk, his mom's boyfriend is a slob, and ryan tries to hold everything together...the best a kid can. He is a hard worker, street smart, and tough, but at the same time you see how gentle and kind and caring and defensive of his friends he is. Everyone that helps him, he helps them too. I don't want to give anything away, but you'll really enjoy this show. It's more like a continuous movie. Seth is a good character too. Shy, funny, Seth sees no problem in trying to hang on to his childhood. While he is known as a geek, Seth is someone who has many qualities that make him a good friend. Seth doesn't act like all the slutty, rich, arrogant teens around him. Seth would rather have a few close, true friends, than 100 shallow friends. When Ryan gets to New Port, he's not accepted. He's known as the kid from a ghetto-like town, trailer trash, and a felon. What all the rich kids fail to see, is they're just as bad if not worse than ryan, but no one cares about the immoral things they do because they're rich. ALl the kids seem self-righteous.

~*Seth's dad feels there is more to ryan than just some bum. He let's Ryan stay with him for the weekend, but things don't start off to well for Ryan. Ryan deals with whatever coems his way, his mom kicked him out and then abandon him, the Cohans' are unsure about him staying with them, and Marissa, the girl nextdoor, is giving him mixed signals. Marissa can't make up her mind whether she wants to stay with her boyfriend, a real jerk, or go out with him. ~

~*The OC will make you laugh, cry, laugh some more, and it shows life as it kind of is. I promise you won't regret buying this product.*~",1104537600,2,2376,4.252212389380531
2122765,5,B0002V7TZQ,"I should let you know right now that I am 14, so I don't have an adult perspective. My best friend talked about this show all last year and after hearing from everyone how great it was (I've never heard a bad thing about it), I decided to watch this season's first episode. I was imediately engrossed by the characters and the romance, I have to say! I watched the first eight episodes one night and stayed up until 3 o'clock. I kept telling myself to turn it off, but I couldn't. Now, every week, my PARENTS, yes my parents, sit down and watch it with me. My dad even said it had some good morals?!?!?!?!?!? I also like how the adults have a major part in the story, which adds some appeal to adults. But this is not a bad show and even though most of my friends' parents are telling them to turn off that *nonsense*, I have become completely addicted to rebellious Marissa, sexy Ryan, geeky jewISH Seth, spoiled Summer, the relationships, breakups, and romance of the O.C.

Adam and Rachel looks like Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson when they go out.

I ended up purchasing this first season and I have to say I was really pleased with how good the show is. I like the fact that the show is not just about kids in high school, but also their parents and family and how they all interact. The cast is really good and believable enough to either make you love them or hate them. The show is very emotional at times and it is very addicting. I think what scared me away before I ever saw an episode was that I figured The O.C. was just another show about rich kids in California like Beverly Hills 90210 and/or Melrose place. The show is so much more than those other shows and has just the right amount of drama mixed in with just the right amount of heart. I highly recommend The O.C. for anyone who likes must see TV.

2122776,5,B0002V7TZQ,"Not to be braggadocio, but I am really getting good at picking up TV Box Sets on a whim, and loving the shows.

The O.C., starts with Ryan, a smart but troubled teen from Chino, California who gets into some legal troubles after being present during a carjack featuring his own brother.  After getting violently thrown out of his own house, he only has one person to turn to; his DA lawyer, Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher).  And thus, he is brought into the lives of the rich and snobby folks of Newport Beach.

With this, what kind of a show would you expect?  Typical bad seed troubled boy come to cause tumult among the citizens of a rich town?  NOT!

Starring the incredible Benjamin McKenzie in the role of Ryan, follow along many tribes and tribulations dealing with many problems on the inside of an outwardly rich community, such as embezzlement, alcoholism, depression, divorce, greed, theft, pregnancy, and overdose.  And then there are happier themes too, involving love, sex, and success, and it's a healthy bunch of it.  The year isn't surrounded by catastrophe, nor is it some kind of unrealistic rich utopia.

It's 27 episodes long...  But you'll wish it was longer.  Pick up the box set to The O.C., especially if you're fans of Dawson's Creek, or even the Gilmore Girls, involving the sappy love stories of DC, and the humor of GG.  This set is worth every penny spent on it.  I hate to say it, but some of you may become an unwilling fan of sappy teen drama...  But VERY GOOD sappy teen drama.",1101168000,8,1509,4.5783582089552235

2122778,5,B0002V7TZQ,"There is a secret in many American households. A secret that grown adults whisper about conspiratorially to each other in office buildings across the country. A secret that 50 year old women hide behind their hands to talk about over lunch. A secret that men desperately don't want their buddies to find out...That dirty little secret is the O.C., the show no self-respecting adult wants to admit watching, but we know you're watching it!

Fox was genius with this show in promoting it during the dead zone of summer reruns. Most of us were clamoring for ANYTHING to watch and they provided us with a smart, fun and addictive show that is just as good the second time around on these DVDs.

The O.C. tells the stories of families in a wealthy community in Orange County, California, that would be the O.C. bit for the uninitiated. There is the usual prime time soap drama, good men, bad boys, good women and absolutely terrible women. What sets this show apart isn't the plots, which are pretty run of the mill, but rather the smart dialog and excellent acting.

The central characters of Sandy Cohen, played by the gorgeous Peter Gallagher, and Seth Cohen, played by the incredibly convincing Adam Brody, are what keep people coming back to the show. These are two of the most gifted actors on TV. They deliver sarcastic punch lines and truly dramatic dialog with equal skill. Other supporting actors, like the eye-pleasing Tate Donovan, round out the excellent cast.

If you missed the first season and you want to see what the buzz is all about, pick up this set and watch it, you won't be disappointed.

2122782,5,B0002V7TZQ,"The first season of ""The O.C."" was the guilty pleasure of the 2003-2004 television series, although when it popped up in the summer of 2003 that really was more the end of the 2002-2003 television series.  After CBS had its great success with the original ""Survivor"" as a summer series, it took a while for somebody to take the next step, which was what FOX did when they offered up this new soap opera into the wasteland of summer reruns.  Actually, the first seven episodes that aired in August and September constituted a test run for ""The O.C.,"" which came back with another twenty episodes starting at the end of October.

The appeal of the show based on the early buzz and media attention was supposed to be on the relationship between Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie), the boy from the wrong side of the track who is given a second chance by a compassionate lawyer, and Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), the spoiled little rich girl who lives next door.  Basically the selling point was that he looked like a young Russell Crowe and she looked like a young Twiggy.  But star-crossed lovers have been down to death, especially with the entire bad boy meets good girl angle, and the real reason we got hooked on this show was the Cohens, Sandy (Peter Gallagher) and Seth (Adam Brody).

Clearly the sarcasm gene is dominant on the male side of the Cohen family.  When Seth is once again the target of golden boy Luke Ward (Chris Carmack), he goes down with his mouth flapping, noting that at least he does not shave his chest.  As Sandy says where he accuses Seth of being sarcastic and his son denies the charge, ""Well, it's hard to tell sometimes.""  Actually it is just safer to assume the Cohens are being sarcastic.  As the only female Cohen points out about her strange little home, ""It's just a laugh riot around here.""  She, of course, is being ironic (rather than sarcastic), because as Sandy tells Seth, ""I love your mother more than words, but not funny.""  But she's cynical and he's self-righteous, and it appears to be working out fine as long as her father stays out of the picture.

This is not to say that the others do not have their moments.  After all, Marissa does listen to the Cramps and Stiff Little Fingers instead of Avril Lavigne, but none of the others are in Sandy and Seth's league.  As for Ryan, as Seth points out he is now a Cohen, which means he has entered ""a world of insecurity and paralyzing self-doubt.""  The problem is that with Ryan around to protect him, Seth fears that he might be getting soft, but he obviously does not need to worry about forgoing the ""Seth Cohen retaliatory zinger.""

Plus, Seth's love life is much more interesting than what Ryan is going through, where he and Luke just keep punching each other out over Marissa (pay attention and you will notice that only one of the first seven episodes does NOT have a punch thrown in it).  Seth, on the other hand(s), is trying to juggle both Anna (Samaire Armstrong) and Summer (Rachel Bilson).  Of course he makes the wrong choice.  Anna already has a fine appreciation of graphic novels, whereas Summer has to be schooled in the basics of comic books.  Seth still wants Summer because he has been the girl of his dreams (if you know what I mean), and having her fall for him provides a level of validation that Anna can never hope to match, even with her Jenga skills.  She tries hard, but Summer is just not good enough for Seth.

I think the standout episode of the first season is ""The Heartbreak,"" where Seth loses his virginity to Summer only to discover that the experience was not all that he thought it would be.  Not only does Seth get a hearty pat on the back from Sandy, but his father also brings up the idea of foreplay, which compels Seth to try, try again.  Yes, there is the joke about Summer declaring they are not having sex again and Seth agreeing that they have had ""enough pain and suffering,"" but the idea that first love could be so disastrous is rather appealing.  If there is a lesson here regarding teenage sex it would be that you should know what you are doing.  None of these kids do and see what happens to them.

By the time we get to the first season's cliffhangers the only one I really cared about was Seth heading out to sea.  The relationship between Ryan and Luke ends up being more interesting than the one between Ryan and Marissa, who find a new reason not to have sex pretty much every single week.  Jimmy Cooper (Tate Donovan), Marissa's father, rips off everybody in town and still comes across better than his wife, Julie (Melinda Clarke), who goes after Kirsten's father, Caleb Nichol (Alan Dale) and ends up marrying him in the season finale.  We dislike him the most because Sandy dislikes him the most.  I do not care if Jimmy and Hailey (Amanda Righetti), Kirsten's sister, end up together because I am depressed over what happened with the restaurant and the competing meatloaf recipes.

Trash television is an important part of a balanced television diet.  You can watch literate shows like ""The Gilmore Girls,"" enjoy the take of ""The West Wing"" on important political topics, debate the wrong moves of the castaways on ""Survivor,"" wrestle with God's will during ""Joan of Arcadia,"" and enjoy the delightful wickedness of ""Desperate Housewives.""  But sometimes you just need to wallow in a prime time soap opera, and with ""The O.C."" we have one that has the constant collision of characters and plot lines with the sort of wit we usually find only on Tina Fey's half of ""Weekend Update.""",1099785600,131,5542,4.574898785425101
2122783,5,B0002V7TZQ,"Soap operas have never been for me. I never watched Dawson's Creek when it was on the air, (although I have enjoyed the DVD sets), or Knot's Landing or Dallas, or any of the typical prime time soap operas.
Something in the commercials for The O.C. dragged me in and I haven't left. Maybe it was the fact that it was one of a few new shows in a schedule full of reruns in August, but I think there was something more.
This show, while geared toward a younger audience, revolves around not only the kids, but the well-developed parental characters. These strong adult characters provide a great backdrop with which to work with and allow for a lot of stories to work around each episode.
Adam Brody is absolutely terrific as Seth Cohen. Without a doubt, he is the breakout star of this show, though kudos can also go out to Ben McKenzie for his brooding portrayal of Ryan Atwood. Brody's development over the course of the 27 episodes from geek to 'ladies' man' is quite impressive. He pulls off the whole scared little kid, yet mature young adult thing very, very well. McKenzie is also stellar, stealing many moments in the show with just the eye-piercing looks that he is capable of shooting at anyone at anytime.
Equally strong are Peter Gallagher and Kelly Rowan as Sandy and Kirsten Cohen, complete opposites, who are completely in love with each other. Exploring their complex relationship as both parents and friends gives this show a great angle that is often not found in teen soap operas.
Melinda Clarke as Julie Cooper is the perfect soap opera character. She goes from one end of the spectrum to the other in her range of emotions and her feelings. You never know what is going to come next from the mouth of Julie Cooper.
Rachel Bilson, Mischa Barton, Chris Carmack and Tate Donovan also add very important pieces to the mix of The O.C. They are the people that help to shape Orange County, contributing in varying ways to the success of the season and to the lives of all those around them.
This show thrives for many reasons. Of course there are the parties and the good times that appeal to the younger crowd. But to me, the success of this show hinges a lot on the adult relationships and the adult story lines. Creator Josh Schwartz has done a fantastic job of developing these very important characters that the fantastic actors have brought to life. Without Sandy and Kirsten Cohen and Julie and Jimmy Cooper, the stories that their kids work through would not be the same. It is obvious that the parents have a big impact on their kids' lives and that makes this show unlike many teen soaps that seem to often put the parents on a back burner. These parents get great story lines and really, Julie Cooper is the one person on the show that you love to hate.
This set is highly recommended and hopefully the second season, which recently began on FOX, will continue the great story lines and great character development that we saw in the first season.",1099785600,9,2971,4.5655430711610485

The show is filled with great characters (Seth, Summer, Anna, Sandy), great drama (Julie Cooper sleeping with her daughter's ex-boyfriend!) and a great heart (The Cohens adopting Ryan shows us the importance of family). You can always count on Seth Cohen to make you laugh, even in the dreariest episodes. But really, every episode is entertaining and just plain fun to watch. I mean, sure, we're spending an hour of our day listening to wealthy people complain about their lives, but that's the whole fun of it. I really recommend this season of the O.C. and hope that it is seen as more than a 'Beverly Hills 90210' follow-up. Even if these characters seem from another world, we can still relate to them and care for them. It's so great because I was a senior in high school when the show aired and on Thursday mornings, EVERYONE was talking about 'last night's episode'. This is a show males AND females can both watch and discuss afterwards.

I for one am very concerned about paying $50 for a set that comes with damaged disks on Day 1 and I haven't seen ANY OC sets (and I have personally seen 4) that haven't had loose disks and damage.

The characters are all great, the history is fantastic, every episode is so exciting. The O.C. had everything; drama, comedy, action, suspense, awesome soundtrack! This DVD is really worthy of $50; it's The O.C.!

To The O.C. fans, there's no reason for no buy this DVD and watch it over and over again.

There are some transcribing problems where the video slows for a few seconds. Also, this show was in widescreen hdtv. Why not make it this way for the dvd like Smallville? Heck, the menus are in anamorphic. This must have been a last minute decision. Still, these are minor complaints. The extras are decent and I am totally addicted to this show.",1099094400,8,490,4.455555555555556

I have seen every episode at least 2-3 times.

The dvd set is great.  The cover/box art is great.  The dvd extras are great as well.  They consist of Creator commentary, and music guides for certain episodes.  The only thing that I didn't like so much about the set was that at the Main Menu of all dvds it plays the same ""California"" song, by Phantom Planet....the song is great (and believe it or not my ring tone) but after hearing it 50 times it does get a little long in the tooth.

But all in all, BUY THIS DVD, you won't regret it.  The picture quality is great! Audio is also great!

1) It took forever to come out.

2) There are ""previously on..."" clips before each episode, which can get a bit annoying if you've just sat through the preceding eps.

But the set up is really nice, the extras are super-sweet (especially the commentary from Josh Schwartz, very helpful to an aspiring screenwriter like me) and even the booklet gives brief overviews of each episode written in the show's refreshingly witty way.  I hightly recommend adding this to your DVD collection.",1098835200,6,573,4.747474747474747

2122801,5,B0002V7TZQ,"Anyone who is looking into buying this set already knows how good this show is. So I'll move on to the technical stuff.

Video:

Warner Bros have really put it on for this set. The video is really nice and sharp. Colours are vibrant and there is a minimal amount of grain in the picture. It's a really good transfer that is much better then the broadcast quality. The video is 4:3 (fullscreen) and not 16:9 (widescreen).

Audio:

This set contains a 2.0 dolby surround. Voices come from the centre speaker and the music is divided over the other 4 speakers. Audio is clear and crisp. Hopefully, for season 2, Warner will use a 5.1 surround sound. This would totally fit with the show.

Extra's:

Nice behind the scenes features and deleted scenes from several episodes.

Conclusion:

If your a fan or not, this set is totally worth the money. Video and Audio is way above average. This seven disc set is a must have for anyone. If your a fan, buy it. If your not a fan 'cause you think it's just another of those teen shows, you'd better buy this set to find out how wrong you are about this show.

2122802,5,B0002V7TZQ,"my mom watched this show religiously from the first episode on.  i made fun of her for weeks, ""oooh, mom, it's wednesday!  time for your little soap opera!!*  she ignored me, and one day after i had been so frustrated with american idol, i just stayed on the couch and watched it with her.  i was instantly hooked.  with friends going off the air, it quickly filled the void that i would have had and now i am confident in sayint that it's my favorite TV show.

it may very well be more soap opera than anything else, but i like to call it a prime time drama.  after all, it only comes on once a week.  (which basically means you have to suffer through an entire 7 days waiting to see just what will happen next!  and then the hour just isn't long enough!)

the characters are so intricately written..  and written so well!  there's always a plot twist, and you have those certain characters that you LOVE and the others that you love to hate.

i watched it religiously from that first time on until the end of the season and all summer long i've been having withdrawals.

i can't wait for these DVDs to come out!  i intend to watch them over and over and over and over again.

all i can say is, don't judge a book by it's cover...  and don't knock it till you try it.",1098316800,3,1268,4.1735537190082646
2122803,5,B0002V7TZQ,"When I saw the previews of The O.C. on tv, I though there would be no way I would watch it. I watched 90210 and Melrose a bit when I was younger and also Dawson's Creek... at first. Then I felt like I grew out of those ""kind"" of shows.

But The O.C. is different. It's edgy, emotional, and hysterically funny at times. I think the actors are all perfectly cast, and the dynamic between all of them works so well, my favorite being the relationship between Sandy (Peter Gallagher) and his son Seth (Adam Brody) as well as with Ryan (Ben Mackenzie). I also agree with a previous comment that Adam Brody is half the reason to tune in... his sharp sense of humor is enough to keep anyone laughing throughout each episode. There is also some fantasic music to be introduced to with every show. Although it can be over the top at times, that's part of what makes it so fun to watch, and no matter what kind of crazy things happen each week, there is always something real to relate to.

The difference between the O.C. and other teen or night-time soaps is that it can appeal to anyone. I watch it every week with my 19 year old brother and 51 year old mom. I've even once gotten into a lively conversation about Ryan and Marissa with a man in his 70's. I was hooked after the 5th or 6th episode so it's exciting to see it coming to dvd so soon... I'm pretty choosy when it comes to buying tv series on dvd, but I can't resist this one.

2122805,4,B0002V7TZQ,"I like this show a lot. The characters are well defined - If really annoying.

Marissa is weak, a contsant damsal in distress. She couldn't handle a little humiliation and her parents' divorce - boohoo. Love to hate her -

Ryan is the Knight looking to save and cursed by circumstances just a little beyond his control.

Summer is the slightly snotty friend who is given both depth and a brain when she eventually lands Seth -

Seth is the intellectual - too smart and awkward for High school - but even his character loses something in his final decision of the season -

The parents are more rounded - at least Seth's. Love his dad. Marissa's mother is cartoonish most the time but is played with such glee that it can be forgiven. Her father - Tate Donavan goes from loser to the one stable piece of Marissa's life - So of course she must live with her mother most the time. And Seth's grandfather is just wonderfully obnoxious, KiKi... JuJu...

It's entertaining to watch them all - The banter is good and what I look for in my tv shows. Soapy as it is - The writing is a lot of fun -",1098057600,5,1088,4.282926829268293

Ive watched so many shows over the years in the teen genre who's sole purpose was to craft each show around trying to teach you something like ""dont steal"", ""dont lie"" etc.  you get the point.  But finally here it is . . . a show that says here is our characters, here is the story and thats it.

The show is actually quite amazing.  first of all its said in a nice locale instead of a normal everyday american setting.  The actors are great and the characters are even better.  Adam Brody is 50% of the reason to watch the show in the first place.  His humor makes you laugh the whole show.  And YES!!! . . parents finally are not made out to be stupid morons ala john hughes with no screen time whatsoever.  NO they actually are depicted like normal parents and a couple and have their own plot lines to follow.  And finally Summer and Anna (who ive heard will be back to fight for seth in season 2) are supremely gorgeous.

They should send her a replacement since it all falls on them, but nothing. Will not be buying from here again.",1514851200,,316,3.876923076923077

8032434,4,B0002V7TZQ,"At first, this was a little odd to me, but as it went on, I really loved it. The characters are so well written and portrayed in this show, it's hard not to like the main four (Ryan, Seth, Marissa, and Summer). Such a great first season to a well done teen drama.",1505088000,,263,3.981132075471698
8032435,5,B0002V7TZQ,"Captures teen drama perfectly, everyone is perfectly dressed and one of them actually has a good golf swing, who knew right?  Pretty formulaic and predictable and just remember they're playing TEENAGERS.  This about that for a sec and find some later pictures when they aren't playing TEENAGERS.  I actually went to a high school like this, and the tail was excellent.",1504483200,,368,5.0
