1200392,3,B00000F160,"I rented this one from our library, and it worth exactly what I paid for it. The scenery and costumes (and lack thereof) are stunning and obviously meticulously researched. Why only three stars? The film seems to be, like a gallery of Renaissance paintings, a succession of beautiful images that have no real connection or overarching storyline. We see Artemisia's story as a series of the actress' pouting lips and desperately emoting eyebrows, but have no real sense of her history or of her personality. A beautiful film to watch, and not a waste of time, but certainly nothing to inspire much thought afterwards.",991872000,3,616,4.9326923076923075
1200393,4,B00000F160,"This film deals with an episode in the girlhood of one of the first women to be taken seriously as a professional artist, Artemisia Gentileschi. Had her father Orazio had a suitable son about the place, Artemisia would most likely have had a more conventional girl's life of stirring sauces, sewing, and keeping house for Papa. (Nothing wrong with domesticity, by the way. Wouldn't mind it myself. It just wasn't right for her.) But there was no son so she worked in the family business which happened to be turning out paintings for wealthy patrons and the Church. To his credit, her father attempted to have her admitted to schools for formal artistic training, but although her talent was outstanding, her sex was against her. She sought out informal instruction from an artist working with her father. The lessons soon included training in lovemaking as well. (I, for one, would like to know what she did to avoid pregnancy! ) When her father discovered what was going on, he went ballistic. He called in the authorities which only made things much, much, worse.  The Italian landscape was gorgeous, the clothing and buildings looked real (women's clothes in period, casual ones anyway, looked really comfortable), and the acting (in clear French) was outstanding. Highly recommended",975369600,,1287,5.014018691588785
1200394,5,B00000F160,"Historical debate aside, the movie was well filmed and enjoyable to watch.  As a previous reviewer mentioned... it did cause me to read more about her  and look at some of her paintings... so the more the better!  As with many  historical controversies, looking at different viewpoints AND doing your  own research/thinking on the subject is the only way to go! ex: Did  Shakespeare really write all those plays????",969235200,2,415,4.942028985507246
1200395,1,B00000F160,"Another feminist diatribe that wants to be taken as ""serious cinema.""  You've heard it before, and here it is again:  Women rule, men are pigs.  Characters are disconcertingly one-dimensional.  Dialogue  could have been written in one's sleep; neither humor nor passion in  evidence here.  Nice (though not outstanding) cinematography; excessive use  of bronze-tone filters.  Really, if you want  yet another feminist harangue, this is the movie for you...  In a movie such as this, it would have been  prudent at least -- at the end, as the credits rolled by? -- to have  included full blown reproductions of the artist's works, which may have  sparked some genuine interest in her as a person.",966297600,4,695,5.035398230088496
1200396,5,B00000F160,"When the film came out in the U.S. in May, 1998, art historian Mary Garrard, who has written a book on Artemisia, along with feminist Gloria Steinnem put up a website attacking the film as untruthful in presenting  what they say was Artemisia's rape by her teacher, Agostino Tassi.  But as  feminist Germaine Greer points out in her chapter on Artemisia in her book  on women painters, the  Obstacle Race, the rape trial transcripts are not  transparent, and there is evidence that suport's Merlet's construction.  (They may be found in an appendix to Garrard's book.)  Garrard spins them  her way (Artemsia was raped, didn't love Tassi; Greer spins them hers  (Artemisia was raped, but came to love her rapist); Merlet spins them hers  (Merlet loved her rapist from the start). Merlet's account of Artemisia is  psychologically complex and is realy intersted in a feminism that departs  from the standard rape narrative (woman undone permanently by traumatic  experience caused by a man).  Garrrd's accpunt was savaged bya  number of  feminist reviewers, adn most recently calleneged (in a friendly way) by  Griselda Pollock in Differncing the Canon and by R. Ward Bissell in his  book, Artemisia Gentileschi. The film is one of many fictonal afterlives,  including a play by Sally Clark aind three novels, three of which have been  translated into English.  These are Anna Banti's, Marine Bramly's (the  basis for the film) and Alexandra Lapierre's.  They are entitled  _Artemisia_.  Raudi Jamis's French novel, also called Artemisia, has not  been translated.  In any case, taking Merlet's film on its terms and in  relation to alternative feminist readings of Artemisia's life and  paintings, I think one will find it intellectually refreshing in its  departures from American ""pop"" feminism, aesthetically pleasing,  and emotionally moving.  If it gets you to go read the trial transcripts  and to look at Artemisia's paintings, so much the better.",962409600,15,1953,5.193548387096774
1200397,1,B00000F160,"I knew going in that this was not the true story of Artemisia Gentileschi, but I had to see it for myself.  I can see why it was changed.  The studio probably wanted a tragic love story to feed to a mass audience and didn't  think they could handle the true story (which I think would have been just  as tragic and more effective).
I wouldn't waste a dime on this movie.  Catch it on cable if you can (I saw it on a channel called 'True Stories',  go figure).  Changing the facts of the story do Artemisia's life and work a  huge disservice.  If you're reading this review, do a little research into  what really happened, then watch the movie to see just how laughable it is.",957312000,8,676,4.2109375
1200398,5,B00000F160,"I am sure this has already been mentioned: this film is basically the reverse story of the real Artemisia Gentileschi (hope I spelled that correctly!) Well, fiction is sometimes more entertaining than truth, and  I'm sure that this is what Ms. Merlet had in mind. Very sexually graphic,  but if a viewer can see the human body as just another art form, this film  should be covered. (No pun intended.)",950054400,,401,4.7
1200399,5,B00000F160,"Being an art and art history buff, I fell in love with this movie.  It is superbly directed and the character of Artemisia draws the viewer right into Baroque Italy.  I have to wonder if this historical drama is accurate,  however- as I have always read that Artemisia Gentilleschi was raped by her  drawing instructor, Tassi.  Now I am left wondering if the history books  took his prosecution at face value, if the writer of the screenplay did  some in-depth investigating, or if she romanticized the story for dramatic  effect (I would be very interested to hear any other viewer's opinion on  this).
Whether the story is accurate or not, I felt that Valentina  Cervi did an especially good job in the leading role as Artemisia.  Michel  Serrault's role of Tassi makes me want to see more by this actor.  The sets  and costumes were also  entrancing.
If you are in the mood for a good  romantic and historic drama, this is a good one to see.  If you can't stand  subtitles and don't have a romantic bone in your body, this is probably not  for you.",940550400,10,1051,4.524064171122995

I imagine that most people are aware that women have not had the equality in many fields and this was certainly true in the art world where men were dominant, well known and admired. When a talented young woman attempts to enter this ""men's club"", especially using nude models, the reaction of the art world is hostile. The movie is photographed beautifully and the cast is exceptional.

1200433,5,B00000F160,Well acted and true to the history of women in Art. Artemesia is not for the feint hearted and must be restricted for those of younger years or delicate taste.

Some reviewers have stated that although this film is historically inaccurate (that's putting it mildly) it's still an enjoyable story. Wrong! This is a pathetic, boring, trite and familiar scenario. Why base a story on a real person and then fill it with banalities? It reminds me of another bad French biopic ""Mozart's Sister."" Artemisia was raped twice. Once by her teacher and again by the makers of this trash. Avoid at all costs!",1335571200,,499,4.813953488372093
1200436,4,B00000F160,"I enjoyed the show very much, and almost fell in love with the spirit of Artemisia. One must give the girl credit for her audacity, perseverance, and the ability to see herself beyond time and frame of the society. All feminist, political statements aside, this movie is very touching. I was touched to see how hard it was for girls [and of course, it's still hard in many societies of the modern world], to use her true talent. Anyway, I read a short bio after watching he movie. The producer and director did take some artistic license, but remained true to a large extent.

1200437,1,B00000F160,"I was so pleased to see many reviews already breaking apart this artsy soft porn scantily clad in a famous artist name.  How incredibly annoying it is to see the exploitation of the immortal artist name for the most pecuniary purposes of those who stage such vulgar garbage.  This is even beyond the discussion on rape, which indeed could have been used to obtain a contract; many artists resorted to any treachery and deceit, as Tintoretto in Scuola Grande di San Rocco (although no rape was involved there!).

What is offending here is vulgarization of art; the destruction of what was initially used to obtain profit in the box office; Artemisia Gentileschi name is used for an erotic tale in style of French beloved ""Emmanuele"", while no notion is given to her actual work.  And how poor it is dramatically - the dialogs are so dumb, predictable and primitive; and acting is to match.  I stopped after 20 minutes watching - it was becoming so repetitive and unbearable.

I give this film one star only for the beauty of costumes, while nudity could be much better filmed - so even from the erotic standpoint, this is a very poor opus.  Also, it is impossible not to give any stars, alas.

It is simply a bad movie - Artemisia or not.  What a waste of budget that could be used for true art or something useful...",1297209600,3,1316,4.56595744680851
1200438,1,B00000F160,"This movie could have some value if you look at it purely as a work fiction, if the stroy wouldn't be so ridiculous. But the director claimed it was Artemisia's true story. Of course, artists can take certain liberties in the portrayal of their subjects, this movie is not a documentary. It is a movie about a young female painter and her sexual initiation. A young women in love with the man who rapped her. (Women don't fall in love with the guys who rapped them).The fact that their names are  those of historical persons, doesn't make the story close to Artemisia Gentileschi's real experiences. And I know this movie was first advertised as showing the true story, which shows how sloppy the research must have been.  I think the director knew that Artemisia, after the rape wanted  Tassi to marry her. And this fact got the basis for the entire twisted story in the movie.

How it was in reality? She was rapped, and as not being a virgin anymore, she wouldn't be able to find a husband.  Those days a woman who was raped was considered loose, and if not married, her life wasn't easy. So, the rape victims got married to the rapists, from fear of society. Her case, her wish and fear is not unusual in this regard. In  he promised her marriage, but didn't keep his promise. There was rape trial, but of course Tassi got a better treatment,as being a man. He could testify without being tortured. She testified under torture, and if anyone reads the trial transcripts, (I did), will see it was rape.  During torture she screamed in one point, ""this is the ring you promised me!"" when the thumb screws were applied. But this doesn't mean she was really in love with him. Cultural history can be very complex, specially when gender issues are involved. What today seems as logical, was not so obvious than:  rape victims got blamed for the crime, as being the accomplice, as being the seductress. As said before, a rape victim would have trouble to find husband. In the movie her story is distorted beyond recognition.

As for me: I am not an Artemisia expert, but I did research on her as an undergraduate student, as many did. She is an icon, and many students or scholars are very interested in her. Historians, art historians, cultural historians, gender and women studies people, students or experts: she is a very attractive subject of interest and research, no doubt. Her true life story is amazing. There is a lot of information about her accessible to a serious seeker. Hey, if I was able to read the translation of the rape trial transcripts, I doubt the director of the movie would have trouble to finding them either! This movie cheapens her achievements, she was quite an exception already when young. And Tassi was not teaching perspective to Artemisia. First, her own father was a better painter than Tassi, and was teaching her the craft, and Artemisia already was a genius while a teenager. She didn't need average painter to teach her. So, I really disliked the movie, those are my reasons.

If you look for a movie about artist's life,a  fictionalized account from which you can learn something about how his/her life was, this is not a movie for this purpose. Yes the costumes are gorgeous, acting two stars, good camera work, but this it is. Unless you like a nice movie about a girl's sexual relationship, this can be enjoyable. But if you wan to see  a more satisfying movie about a painter, not the main character though, with even more beautiful pictures (they look like paintings by Dutch Masters), better acting, I recommend The Girl with the Pearl Earring. This is fiction, but never pretended to be a true story.",1226448000,4,3645,4.651632970451011
1200439,2,B00000F160,"I have done extensive research for years concerning Artemisia Gentileschi, and I am always looking for new material to share with my college students when I teach the Baroque period and the lack of women visible during that time.  I previewed the DVD when it was promptly received, and I found it totally unsuitable for college viewing; I might have even lost my job!

1200450,4,B00000F160,"The '98 French film `Artemisia' fluctuates back and forth between artsy, romantic, decadent, eloquent and profound. According to a large number of reviews preceding mine the film is greatly lacking in historical content and since I know nothing about this real life figure from the 17th century other than what is portrayed in this film I will not attempt to contradict their opinion. I will simply confine my comments to the film itself.

`Artemisia' is a dreamy, insightful period piece with the lovely Valentina Cervi in the role of the immensely talented painter Artemisia. The task of finding an appreciative audience for this film falls predominately on Valentina's shoulders. As she battles against the limitations placed on 17th century women by society at large one must be able to relate to the interior angst and anger of the highly artistic and emotional Artemisia if one is going to stay focused on the storyline. In my opinion Valentina did a superb job displaying her feelings and frustrations non-verbally through her expressive and angelic face and bottomless, unfathomable eyes. If you like her performance you'll enjoy the film, if you don't then it's time to move on.

`Artimisia' is a bit uneven here and there and probably too slow for some. However the scenes and dialogue between Artimisia and her art teacher and love interest Agostino Tassi (Miki Manojlovic) are beautifully done and make it well worth watching.",1211068800,4,1438,5.088983050847458
1200451,2,B00000F160,"I've been doing a lot of research about the artist Artemisia Gentileschi, and this movie really doesn't fit the historical data that we do have about this amazing artist and woman.

It's a beautiful movie, but the facts are just wrong, especially concerning her rape by her tutor, Agostino Tassi.  It is unfortunate that the filmmakers chose to portray her in this light, because she was such an amazing, talented, and strong woman.  This movie really dampens her strength and determination by making her into a seductress instead of a victim.",1157328000,5,543,4.945054945054945
1200452,3,B00000F160,"This is the story of Artemisia Gentileschi. According to the end of the movie, she was the first woman painter to be commissioned for her work. I decided to do a little research since to be honest, I haven't heard of her. I guess from the information I have found, this film is a romanticize version of her early life. In this film, she is shown to be a precocious minx who falls in love with Agostino Tassi, her mentor. What I've read, she was raped. I don't want to give too much away, you can Google information yourself before/after or instead of watching the movie. This film borders on pornography and to some viewers I'm sure it will be pornography. Even I'm not sure. So this will be offensive to some and definitely not for children. If anyone is interested in learning more about her, I personally would not recommend this movie. Read a book about her or check out a biography of her here on the internet.",1154476800,,915,4.420118343195266
1200453,2,B00000F160,"The movie is an evocative work of art.  I encourage people to read all the reviews if they want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view.  I agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have been made by other reviewers, but I will limit my comments to items not previously mentioned.

The DVD cover gives the false impression that this is a love story about two young lovers, a sort of ""Blue Lagoon"" from the Renaissance.  It is not.  It is misleading.

I concede a) the story is probably not historically accurate, b) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any definition, & c) Tassi was probably inconsiderate, conceited, and immoral.  But the quality of a film is not judged solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the characters.  Having said that, I do object that the movie, according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best evidence available, is not just inaccurate, but oppositional to what probably occurred.  Therefore, I critique the film for portraying itself as the story of a real person.  The movie stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical effects with fictional (or incorrect) causal factors.  And those cause-effect relationships don't seem to ring true.

Having said that, I agree with some of Richard Burt's review comments that ""historical accuracy"" may still be subject to interpretation.  It is reasonable that Artemisia may have been more adversarial speaking in a public rape trial (defending her freedom and reputation) than she might have been with Tassi personally.  And it seems too easy to just paint Tassi as a purely evil character as other reviewers have done.  There is usually more complexity and diverse/conflicting interests in most people, especially artists.

One strong objection - near the end of the film, Artemisia says, ""No one dies of sorrow.""  While there is probably some intended sarcasm in the comment, the line frustrated me.  People DO die of sorrow.  My limited experience has suggested that some of the smartest, most sensitive, artistic, and caring people I've encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow.  And the people I have admired the most are the same people who have been mortally threatened by sorrow.  Not selfish, controlling, or passive-aggressive sorrow, but rather sorrow that comes from other less obvious motivations - often unidentified & misunderstood misconceptions.  Sorrow can lead to literal death and deaths of the spirit, character, the soul, & creativity.  Sorrow is not incidental.  Sorrow can destroy health.  Or as the Angel of America in ""Angels in America"" says, ""The body is the garden of the soul.""  Sorrow is worth full attention.

The movie tries to examine the effect of Artemisia's loyalties to her father and her teacher.  The screenwriter is not bent on us assessing those relationships as simply ""good"" or ""bad""; both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad effects on Artemesia.  Her loyalties encourage her artistry and her expression.  They work to create an environment that does not inhibit or conceal her gifts.  At the same time, they are so intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices, privacy, and pacing beyond her desired level of influence.

Artemisia realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except for her father's drive and design.  At the same time, she also laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations she could participate in - in polite society.

May your loyalties encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can find.  And may the best personal truths you can find shape your loyalties.

Compare Caravaggio's ""Judith Beheading Holofernes"" to Artemisia's version of the same painting.  Her version is more violent, realistic (less idealized in posing, dirtiness, lighting, etc.).  Her version has the female servant actively helping Judith.  Artemisia's paintings show a palpable understanding of hate, violence, sexuality & compassion.  Artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and experiences she knew best.  That's why people care about whether a movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately - because we want to know what led her to her creative decisions.",1153094400,5,4288,5.183406113537118
1200454,4,B00000F160,"We all know about the magnificence of the male artists of the Renaissance, and especialy those of Italy.

Because she was female, she was not allowed to attend the prestigious art academy and so continued working on her own and with her father.

However, if the director believed that incorporating pornography in the film would make up for its lack of historical accuracy, she was sadly mistaken.  First of all, Artemisia ""was"" raped by Agostino Tassi--although she did not bring up a case against him as soon as it happened--and she never fell in love with him.  Agostino Tassi, likewise, was never the loving and caring person portrayed in this film but an opportunistic man who believed himself to be superior to all other artists of his time, and the reason he raped Artemisia was that a virtuous girl would ""pay"" a lot of money amongst friends, and the one who rid the girl of her virginity would win and ensure that the girl didn't find a suitable husband.  Yes, Artemisia did go to trial, and yes she was tortured, but all the while for her case against Agostino Tassi.  She accused him of rape--even though her father did not support her--and won her case after being tortured and ridiculed for being a ""female painter"".

1200458,4,B00000F160,"This beautiful movie is founded on historical fact. Artemisia was a real woman, immensely talented, and truly someone who blazed a womanly trail in a man's world. Much past that, it's not at all clear how much fiction mixed in to make a watchable story.

Ignoring any documentary failings, this does make fair drama. Her father encouraged and trained her as an artist into her teens. At that point, he knew that she needed other teachers, even though the schools were open only to men. He apparently didn't know that she was developing into a woman as well as an artist, or blotted that fact from his fatherly mind. He called on a talented co-worker to continue her training.

Therein lies the complexity. That working relationship was already difficult because of professional jealousies, financial power-tripping, and jockeying for the commissions that paid the bills. Throw in a beautiful young lady who's just opening the doors to womanhood, and add a French scriptwriter. The result is tempestuous, and a net loss to all concerned: father, daughter, and tutor/lover. Artemisia's eventual happy ending happens long after the last scene, and appears only as a brief note before the credits.

One point ties the whole of the movie together: the Artemisia character's singleness of mind, her total passion for visual image, even ahead of her physical passions. The father is the character that has my sympathy. He truly wanted what he thought was a good future for his daughter. I think no one was more horrified than him, not even Artemisia herself, at physical interrogation his legal action imposed on her.

If the director, in her movie had shown the very powerful piece ""Susannah and the Elders"" her theory of Artemisia's romance with Tassi would have been ripped to shreds.  Only a woman suffering from circumstance and a cruel injustice could've depicted scenes with such passion.  In the painting Susannah's face and posture show such despair and hopelessness.  Also, Judith and Holofernes (sp?), it doesn't take a genius to see the violence there.  For Heaven's sake, she's sawing his head off, no quick slice there!  Judith's face is one of grim determination.  Plus only a female director who submits passively to domestic abuse and lacks self esteem or vision can make a rape into a gentle love affair(yes, I am saying I think the director needs counseling).

However, it was a beautiful movie.  It captured the spirit of a girl who probably had a soul akin to the artist, however this story was not the story of Artemisia.  I think it is so strange that they even put her name as the title.  This is the kind of thing that history professors create to trap all of the slackers who refuse to read thier history books and try to take the easy way out by renting the video.

1200483,1,B00000F160,"Everybody else has clarified for you that the REAL Artemisia's story is not told here and is actually ""inverted"", i.e. they turn the story of her rape into a consensual love affair.
But that's far from the worst thing...I think the worst thing about this smarmy, heavy-breathing costume flick is that it makes the story of a brilliant woman painter's career into a story about who she sleeps with. And that's a terrible injustice.
The least interesting thing about Artemisia Gentilleschi is her sex life. If this film had the slightest integrity it would have at least shown her paintings. If you viewed this movie and had no other knowledge of the artist and the historical period, you would come away feeling you had watched a 17th century version of the Red Shoe Diaries...i.e., softcore porn, in this case focused on the smarmily told sexual awakening of a pretty teenage girl. Ugh.
You can skip this one... or watch if if you are an adult, but please please do not offer it up to a youngster, especially a girl, as any kind of ""life of the artist"" type of film (like the vastly superior ""Frida"" about Frida Kahlo), because this movie just sends absolutely the wrong kind of message to girls, that your sexuality is the most interesting thing about you, and talent is only another way to get laid.",1067472000,17,1301,4.660869565217391
1200484,1,B00000F160,"I cannot see why this movie was attacked by feminists. Artemisia loses her human lover, but never once is her muse endangered; her power is maintained intact. I cannot see why this movie is attacked for being too feminist. Artemisia has little to no identifiable personality: she loves to paint, and is a hypersexualized voyeur. Within the scope of the movie itself, she displays nothing in the way of power; she is continually at the mercy of her father, Tassi, and the Church, and her resistance is more petulance than spirit.
Ultimately, however, this is a movie, and must be judged as such. And, as such, I found it sorely lacking. The characters were shallow, the plot meandering. There was no sense of emotional or psychological depth; whispered mutterings about disjointed images do not count. For a movie about a painter, the visuals were eminently forgettable -- and I say that as a professional artist myself.
And, while we're picking nits, most of the clothing was just as questionably accurate as the details of the story itself. It was clearly designed for ease of removal, rather than historical verismilitude.
Which brings us back to the intent of the film's makers, and their choices in presentation. To reiterate, this is a movie, not a scholarly biography. Yet, the cover copy does flatly state that this is ""the highly provocative true story"" of Artemisia Gentileschi. That is debatable, at best, and flat out fraudulent at worst. The story presented in the historic accounts strikes me as a far stronger one: a 17 year old girl defying torture to have her rapist held accountable for his crimes. This is the story of a woman strong enough to be the first to enter the Academy. The pouting, prancing, rather stupid girl of the movie just seems to skate through, and the film does not create sufficient tension to carry the day. She neither scores a meaningful victory (her artistic success is only presented in a textual epilogue splashed onto the screen) nor does she suffer a tragic defeat (sure, she loses her lover, but she has a long, successful, and fulfilling life thereafter.) In short, there's nothing, really, to make a movie about.
Oh, wait. There are lots of naked people. That explains it.",1045785600,11,2221,4.847368421052631

1200486,2,B00000F160,"In the words of Gentileschi biographer Mary Garrard and cultural commentator Gloria Steinem, ""In the fully documented trial of 1612, Agostino Tassi was charged with and convicted of the rape of Artemisia Gentileschi. He never confessed to the crime, and on the contrary, tried to accuse Artemisia's father of having deflowered her, and to insist she had also written love letters to other men -- though she could barely write at the time. Artemisia testified repeatedly under oath and torture that she had been [raped] by Tassi. She described the event in explicit and graphic detail, and her own resistance to the point of wounding him with a knife.""

1200488,4,B00000F160,"This film is a must-see for feminists and art historians although (or perhaps precisely BECAUSE) it may make you angry.  It is a beautiful, intensely sympathetic study of the young Artemisia Gentileschi, her struggles to learn and grow as an artist in a society that makes it very difficult for her to do so, and her relationships with the men in her life.  Artemisia has no desire to be the feminist role model that she later became (how could she?  The word and concept of ""feminism"" didn't exist in her day), she just needed to paint.  The part of this movie that infuriated feminists is its portrayal of her relationship with her much older and very disreputable teacher Tassi as consensual, rather than as a violent rape, followed by a relationship in which Artemisia reluctantly cooperated because he had promised her marriage.
According to modern definitions, of course, Tassi was guilty of some form of rape, whether Artemisia said ""yes"" or ""no,"" because she was only 17 at the oldest, and he took advantage of his position of power.  But there may be some truth in the movie's version of their relationship; Artemisia wouldn't be the first or the last young woman to have a crush on an older teacher, and to try out her powers of sexual attraction without fully understanding the consequences.  It's true that the movie probably whitewashes Tassi's character in order to portray his relationship with Artemisia as a love story.  In the actual trial transcript, Artemisia mocked him bitterly when they applied the thumb-screws to her hands during testimony, saying, ""This is the wedding ring you promised me!""  If she had ever felt any affection for him, it was gone by then.  But if you allow the film some leeway for artistic license, it presents a fascinating study of how even a seemingly devastating experience like the rape trial and scandal could be part of an artist's growth.  Artemisia's later career was not that of a poor, wronged victim; she went on to become a very successful painter.",999648000,62,2007,4.825072886297376
1200489,4,B00000F160,"""Artemisia"" concerns a teenage woman in 1600s Rome who wants to become an artist.  She has the talent, no doubt, but is the wrong gender to make a go of it.
Artemisia's wonderfully supportive father, an artist himself, helps her to get some minor work painting frescoes.  But what Artemisia really wants is to learn, and to learn from the best.  Thus she approaches Tasso, a well-known artist who has a taste for the debauched (ever-curious about the subject of human sexuality, Artemisia spies on him while he is at a bordello).
It will come as no surprise that Tasso and Artemisia eventually begin an affair after her father convinces Tasso to teach her.  The affair is open to interpretation--did Tasso rape Artemisia, or did he initiate her sexually because they really loved each other?  This becomes an important point later in the film as Tasso goes on trial for raping her.
I will not spoil the outcome of the trial.  In fact, the trial is the least interesting aspect of the film.  Far more interesting is Artemisia's growth as an artist and her struggle against male-dominated artistic convention.  All the performances are sound, but Valentina Cervi as Artemisia is a wonder, simultaneously innocent and relentlessly curious.
I recommend this film for lovers of foreign films (the film is in French with English subtitles) and those interested in the subject of women artists and their struggles.",998265600,7,1407,4.932203389830509
