8459365,5,B0056AR4DK,"This is an amazing recording of an amazing orchestra with an amazing conductor. Harnoncourt is incredible in what he sees through the score and the music is just ...incredible.
Added bonus: the DVD with the rehearsal, the informative libretto..... a memory to cherish and a precious lesson in music and philosophy and life!",1519084800,,323,5.113207547169812
8459366,4,B0056AR4DK,"The film of the rehearsal is very interesting and produces some passionate playing from the orchestra, especially in Vltava (The Moldau).  Unfortunately, Harnoncourt forgot to retain the excitement for the performance.  This is possibly the dullest recording of Vltava I have heard, although it may not sink to the level of his Concertgebouw performance available online.  If you are interested in Harnoncourt's Ma Vlast, the RCA recording with the Vienna Philharmonic is very well played and recommendable; he is an inspired guide especially to the last three tone poems in the cycle.  I would buy this again only for the rehearsal film.",1491264000,,638,5.2254901960784315
