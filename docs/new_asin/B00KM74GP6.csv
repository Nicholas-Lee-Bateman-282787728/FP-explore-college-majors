8659962,4,B00KM74GP6,"Okay, ""Speck"" was lousy.  Lots of artsy camera angles, but short on truth.  A statement from serial killer Ed Kemper was attributed to Richard Speck, and the sole survivor seemed to be doing her best to get caught.  Two stars

""The Amy Fisher Story"" was well done, great cast, great acting, Amy was precocious, Joey was in denial, and Mary Jo was impaired.  Four stars

""Ted Bundy"" was based on ""The Stranger Beside Me"" and Ann Rule was portrayed by Barbara Hershey.  This movie was above average.  Five stars

""Elizabeth Smart"" was another really good movie that stuck to the real story.  Elizabeth was taken from her bed when she was 14 by a self-claimed religious zealot and held prisoner for nine months.  Four-and-a-half stars",1463529600,,731,4.768

8659967,4,B00KM74GP6,"Good four movie collection.  I wouldn't have called it horror, more like true crime.  Speck was gory and hard to watch - my least favorite movie on the disc, but I didn't know the story so it was interesting.  Drew Barrymore was great as Amy Fisher and did a great accent - This was a made for TV movie, I think.  I liked Elizabeth Smart, another made for TV movie and very well done.  Ted Bundy was good - he was such a creep. I loved this one because I didn't know about his connection with Anne Rule and I love her books.  All and all, very pleased with this collection. Please note many of these movies are older so SD video quality reflects the age of the movie.",1456531200,2,667,4.131782945736434
