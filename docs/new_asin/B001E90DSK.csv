8297134,5,B001E90DSK,"Long before James West and Artemus Gordon traveled the West as U.S. Treasury troubleshooters, Cowboy G-Men Pat Gallagher and Stony Crockett rode the video range battling crime as government agents charged with fighting injustice and bringing wrongdoers before the bar of the law.

Gallagher was played by Russell Hayden, still handsome and youthful looking after 15 years as a B-western leading man.  His partner, Crockett, was portrayed by Jackie Coogan.  Coogan was in the middle of a career that started as an extremely popular child star in 1920s silent movies, spanning through his iconic role as Uncle Fester in 60s sitcom ""The Addams Family"".  Still in his 30s when this series was lensed, the burly Coogan gets most of the program's good lines, but also shows he's as quick with a gun as he is with a quip and is just as effective in the action sequences as he is in the comic ones.

The series' action takes places throughout the West... and Southwest and Midwest and, well, everywhere from the Wisconsin lumber country to Colorado high country with side trips to Ozarks mining camps and California ranch land and manages to do so without once looking like it was filled in suburban Los Angeles.

Strong scripts, taut direction, likeable stars and interesting settings places this early Western series quite a few notches above other juvenile fare airing in the early 50s.  Ten of the series' 39 episodes are available in this set:

Safe Crackers (co-starring Mae Clarke and John Vosper)
