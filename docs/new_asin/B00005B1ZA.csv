7936327,5,B00005B1ZA,This is a good movie buy.  I like all Lone Ranger movies with Clayton Moore.  He's the best of all.,1395964800,,99,3.9
7936328,4,B00005B1ZA,"This is a great little box set of dvds. The old Republic feature edited Hi-yo Silver is a quaint reminder of the old cliffhanger, but only serves to remind us that there has only been one true Lone Ranger, Clayton Moore. The Lost Episodes disc is worth the price of admition in itself, it's great to see the various comercials and promos together with the old savings bond film.
It was also fascinating to see De Forest Kelley making an early appearance (I never knew he ever looked that young!) as well as a guest slot from Don Heggarty, before he was ""Struck by lightening"".
Well recommended.",1033862400,16,594,4.5607476635514015
