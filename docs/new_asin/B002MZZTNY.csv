8374433,3,B002MZZTNY,"A new species of insect is discovered on an island. Unfortunately, the venom of these tiny creatures causes insanity in anyone bitten by them! Meanwhile, a B-52 bomber, complete w/ H-BOMB, is attacked by swarming bugs and crashes nearby! Soon, carnage ensues, as nefarious men attempt to find the bomb, and the insects begin destroying humanity. The most interesting thing about WAR OF THE INSECTS (aka: GENOCIDE) is its diverse, unusual cast of characters. There are actual, flawed people inhabiting the island, some of whom are quite damaged. There are some truly reprehensible folks in this movie! Especially  the wicked Annabelle (Cathy Horan), a concentration camp survivor who takes on the characteristics of the Nazis from her tortured past. Her plan to destroy the planet is the black heart of the film. A very ambitious project that suffers from a miniscule budget and the merciless march of time. Released in 1969, this is certainly a movie of its period, not holding up so well today. Worth seeing once...",1491264000,,1016,5.0476190476190474
8374434,1,B002MZZTNY,"I am delighted that Sinister Cinema has begun to release so many oddball and unknown movies on DVD, but would have been, in retrospect, even happier if they had decided to skip ""War of the Insects"" (alternate title: ""Genocide"".) I watched this movie on Vicodin while recovering from knee surgery, and while that made my recently sawn-open knee feel purely blissful, it could not quench the pain this movie inflicted deep in my brain. Seriously.

The plot revolves around a US B-52 bomber with a hydrogen bomb onboard. While it cruises over a strange island it collides with a huge swarm of insects (honorary mention: worst special effect ever) that, after making some of the crewmen crazy, makes the bomber catch fire and crash losing the H-bomb in the process. Three crewmen eject, two of whom are found dead of strange injuries in a cave, and one, Charlie (Chico Lourant), who is crazy when discovered by rescuers due to an extreme case of insect taunting. Because there aren't enough elements working in the plot, a few more get tossed haphazardly in at this point. There is a communist cell working to capture the H-bomb on the island, there's a local man wrongly accused of the American's deaths by a confusing government organization with wholly unclear motives and his pregnant girlfriend's fight to free him, and there's Annabelle (Cathy Horan) who makes the rest of the plot seem linear and logical. Annabelle is a survivor of a Nazi concentration camp, you see, and that's made her mad at the Americans (for some reason), and just about everybody else too. Annabelle's also a lunatic scientist who injects certain passive and harmless insects with poison from others to make horrible mutants that will destroy mankind.

Yes, you get all this in one movie, along with exceptionally confusing dialogue (some of which may have been further rent asunder by the dubbing process), terrible acting, continuity problems galore, head-scratching direction, and enough plot elements for any ten Hollywood big-budget disaster movies. The film is bleak, dark, and nonsensical. The insects of the title are mostly bees, and are diminutive in both size and number. It ends appropriately, though not soon enough, with an atomic explosion. I would have only wished that all copies of this film were placed at ground zero prior to the detonation, so humanity would never have to face ""War of the Insects"" again.",1279411200,8,2403,4.975124378109452
