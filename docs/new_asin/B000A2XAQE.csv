8073138,1,B000A2XAQE,"This product was not as good as I thought it would be. There were good parts but overall, I was not satisfied with this movie. For a person looking for real womanization (for lack of a better word, I would not recommend this one.",1212364800,2,229,4.2272727272727275
8073139,4,B000A2XAQE,"This is a freaky, deranged, and startling character study.  A stalker is roaming the streets, using chloroform to knock out women, and then groping their naked bodies.  He doesn't rape them, just cops a feel and takes some pictures.
This low budget film drags you into a world of unconscionable atrocities.  There is a constant, uncomfortable tension as this lunatic does his deeds.  You soon realize he is suffering from severe depression, loneliness, guilt, shame, alcoholism--still you can't come close to pitying the guy.  He is not totally evil, more just mentally unstable.  His past eventually becomes evident as you realize where his problems began.
I loved the confrontation with his ex-wife.  She emphatically screams ""What do you think you can come back here, knock me out, and then f__k me?"".  Aww, no such luck.
The camera work looks like a home video job, which definitely adds to the realism and rugged feel for the heinous crimes.  The dark sound effects initially seem very creepy but do start to get a little repetitive.  The acting throughout this movie is adequate but nothing special.
This is a slightly disturbing venture but if you're looking for something significantly more evil in the same vein, checkout Scrapbook.",1201392000,12,1241,5.03921568627451
8073140,1,B000A2XAQE,"With a title like ""Bizarre lust of a sexual deviant"" you would think this movie would be creepy and edgy but what you get is a very soft core B-movie. I won't bother you by talking about the so called plot because there isn't much of one. Here's the overview. A guy knocks women out,takes pictures of them naked and then goes home...that's it. Oh yeah, he also likes to touch the womens necks and shoulders while they are knocked out. He is very careful not to actually touch the womens private areas because that would cross the line from being a bizarre sexual deviant to being just a sexual deviant. This movie is so bad i actually threw it away. Avoid at all cost!",1173484800,21,668,4.352

8073144,2,B000A2XAQE,"Sicko goes around knocking women out with some sleep agent on a hanky,strips them photographs them and then the victims wake up dazed and confused and thats about it aside from one of the victims trying to catch the sicko after she is a victim, more of a fantasy fetish film as opposed to a serious film you can tell this by the short running time of 57 minutes, which is also taken up by a long talking sequence of about 10 mins and unnessecary dwelling camera shots of the sky.",1055721600,3,479,4.274725274725275
