8495719,2,B006A8XGPC,"After this movie I guess Hollywood would no longer bank photogenic movie actors. ""Jennifer On My Mind"" goes down as another ""Love Story"" gone ""Easy Rider,"" and in that timeframe that places them among hundreds of other forgettable films dealing with the travails of the rich, materialistic hippies. No wonder Erich Segal,(script writer) vanished, he writes about 2 gorgeously blessed kids starting out with marijuana and sinking into heroin. Does that sound interesting to you? Me, neither. The locales are wonderful but undershot: Venice and an estate on the Hudson Valley, my guess. If I had $50,000 and 2 beautiful kids like: Tippy Walker, an actress that shines standing still without an utterance, and Michael Brandon and a lakeside home with a pool and a tennis court, I think I could come up with a better script than this depressing klunker. Robert De Niro in cameo as a cab driver was the only inspired actor present in the film. Barry Bostwick, so what. Watching this film was like watching the destruction of a landmark museum up close. The producers probably felt it would discourage drugs depicting two trust baby brats destroying themselves without any interfering parents or family. That it did not. It showed 2 drifting souls on vacation or at vacant, luxurious dwellings harming one another. Not much of a romantic buildup either. ""Jennifer On My Mind"" had all the ingredients of ""Love Story"" without the scaffolding of ""Camille"" to buttress it up.(In other words, Segal, a classicist, could not be original) Sadly, if you want to see cardboard characters with no personal lives, all the trappings of ""Sabrina"" without the smart, savvy script to match this is your only one-way trip. Rent ""The World of Henry Orient"" instead and enjoy the scene-stealing antics of Tippy Walker when people inhabited the scenery with hopeful lives. To have Tippy Walker and squander her heavenly essence only goes to show that Hollywood corrupts absolutely.",1358208000,3,1956,5.0588235294117645
