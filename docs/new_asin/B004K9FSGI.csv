8432617,3,B004K9FSGI,"""Vampire Warriors"" (""Jiang shi xin zhan shi"") is a Hong-Kong martial arts action about two girls Ar (Jiang Luxia) and Max (Chrissie Chau). Ar and Max are best friends, despite the fact that Ar is a vampire hunter and Max is a vampire. But Max has never sucked human blood because she belongs to a ""vegetarian"" vampire clan (like the Cullen family) led by a womanizing 1500-year-old patriarch Lung (Siu-hou Chin).

One day an evil vampire Mung (Yuen Wah) arrives, looking for the blood of vampires (not humans) so that he can be more powerful. A life-or-death battle begins.

Action sequences are decent, with some nice martial arts moves from the stars Jiang Luxia and Yuen Wah. (Yuen Wah played an evil vampire in a cult classic ""Mr. Vampire"" in 1985.) Veteran Xin Xin Xiong (impressive as a deadly assassin in ""Shaolin"") briefly appears in a cameo role.

However, the film's non-action part is very dull. The storyline itself is not bad, and the heroines' relationship suggestive of lesbianism has potential for an action movie with difference, but director Dennis Law (""King of Triads"") misses every chance to make the film interesting. (Incidentally the film's title in UK is ""Lesbian Vampire Warriors."" This is strange because there is not much lesbianism in it.)

Watch ""Vampire Warriors"" for its martial arts action scenes that are acceptable. As for the rest of the film, well ... the film's concept is good, but poor execution has ruined it.",1365292800,,1450,4.906122448979592
