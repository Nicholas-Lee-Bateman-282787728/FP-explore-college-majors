I was expecting the workout to be like most others where you simply do the workout with the instuctor. I will try to do this a few more times. But honestly you could look up the exercises and do them with an egg timer. Also i felt there were NOT enough exercises don't that utilized the pole. The purpose of a dvd (for most people) is its like have an instuctor there with you and someone doing the workout with you. At least thats what ive come to understand being apart of at home DVD workout forums. So for the price...its a bit high for the content.
Please note that i love Leigh Anns BeSpun pole dance dvds.",1489449600,,821,4.2025316455696204
