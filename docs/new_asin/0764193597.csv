3728,5,0764193597,My son loved this DVD. He sings the song all the time now. We read him the book first and he loved it. The video was even better. This one is MUCH better than others we have seen.,1269216000,,179,3.736842105263158
3729,5,0764193597,"Grandson likes it. Don't be surprised when you see images of poop. Good, educational product.",1251504000,,93,5.266666666666667
3730,2,0764193597,"This is an entertaining enough cartoon for kids to watch, and mine do, but it is only in the most tangential way about learning to use the potty. It's a fifteen-minute movie and the kid doesn't even get the potty for about eight minutes.

The fact that everything is in rhyme bugs only me. The kids don't mind, and you do turn it out. The 21-month-old likes it more than the three-year-old. It's probably not a coincidence.

We got this with a little book called ""The Potty Book"" about the same little boy with the same art. The book is of great interest to the baby, although it still doesn't really have that much to do with the potty either. The movie and the book are just about an ordinary little boy who learns to use the potty while doing ordinary things. It doesn't tell anyone how to do it.",1227744000,5,799,4.32
3731,5,0764193597,I purchased this DVD for my little boy to go along with his Henry potty training book.  It's a fun and cute movie that my little one enjoys watching over and over.,1215993600,2,163,4.09375
7788486,5,0764193597,This is a Cute video and my son loves to watch it.,1519603200,,50,3.25
7788487,3,0764193597,I was not crazy about this video. By the time it gets to the potty training part of the video the kids have lost interest.,1501545600,,122,3.92
7788488,5,0764193597,Super cute movie that really works! As they talked about big boy pottys and big boy underwear I had his nearby so he could make the comparison and was ready to try!,1498780800,,164,4.15625
7788489,5,0764193597,So cute.  My firstborn son was obsessed with this cute video and song.  He was potty trained before he turned 2.,1469664000,,112,4.285714285714286
7788490,5,0764193597,My kids love watching it and we talk about it.  We are now learning about potty training and this video was helpful to them.,1462147200,,124,4.166666666666667
7788491,5,0764193597,THis DVD was PERFECT!  My son was using the potty in no time once the song from this DVD was stuck in his head.  He wanted it on day and night for months on end.  The parent might grow tired but it gets the job done.,1386547200,,216,3.652173913043478
7788492,5,0764193597,"I've shown this video (library copy) to my son periodically since he was 18 months old to introduce the concept of potty training.  Songs are catchy, and the colors and movement of characters keep his attention (no small feat). He is now 22 months old and still working on potty training.  He seems to have the DVD memorized and was VERY excited when it arrived in the mail today. We actually bought the same potty for him that is featured in the video so that he could identify with what he sees. Sometimes he watches the video while on his potty. He always sings ""Bye-bye pee-pee, bye-bye poop"" when he flushes so he is learning.",1338595200,2,631,4.478260869565218
7788493,1,0764193597,"According to the blurb on the back cover, this movie includes a song called ""Bye-Bye Diapers"" (to the tune of The Beatles' ""Bye-Bye Love"").

It's to that tune, alright, but the words are NOT ""Bye-Bye Diapers.""
Here are the lyrics:
BYE BYE PEE-PEE
BYE BYE POOP

Need I say more?  What parent wants their kid singing THIS song in public?

And, the child psychologists who wrote this movie either had no role in the lyrics (a shame) or if they did, they need to be fired.  Because, when we potty train, we don't say BYE BYE to peeing and pooping - that stays with us for life.

This movie only played in our house for one day.  Ironically our son is looking for it everywhere because the song is so catchy, he wants to sing it all the time.  ANOTHER REASON WHY you should NOT GET THIS MOVIE.

Oh - and the movie you're looking for?  POTTY POWER",1333929600,,841,4.265822784810126
7788494,1,0764193597,This movie is absolutely annoying and my son doesn't even like the movie! My daughter who is seven was like not this again. And I only played it twice. I tried to be positive of the movie but can't. If you are trying to get your child out of the diaper it takes like 7 or 8 minutes to get to the point that you should use the toilet. It talks about doing the doo doo and pee in the diaper and to me that was making it okay for my son to stay in the diaper. Then it goes to using the toilet it to me is confusing I just do not encourage the purchase in this movie!,1333756800,,563,3.7394957983193278
7788495,2,0764193597,"Yes - our son loves this video.  However, the grammar is awful, so we'll have to un-teach the bad English, once he's potty trained......  Also - the music is super low-brow, rock-n-roll-ish.  I was hoping for a catchy tune which wasn't quite so ..... crappy..... (ha ha ha).  In general - if you don't care about the free-fall of culture and civilization, this video will do the trick.  If you do, you might want to make your own video, and sell it to the rest of us.",1289347200,8,467,4.32183908045977
