4157593,5,B003NFM3JK,"The story of ""A Christmas Carol"" and its themes haven't been fresh in people's minds for well over 100 years, which is why the new film adaptation by Robert Zemeckis is so surprising. This is, from my perspective, the definitive version - a sumptuous visual feast that in no way compromises the drama, excitement, and hope of the Charles Dickens classic. Its greatest achievement is not reducing itself to the level of jolly Christmas clichs. The streets and buildings of nineteenth-century London are brightly coated with snow, yet they betray the cold reality of poverty and despair. And Ebenezer Scrooge, having been played by many, many actors over the years, finally looks like the ancient, decrepit, bitter man I always imagined him to be; his face doesn't show the slightest trace of warmth, humor, or charm.

The film's success can be attributed to Zemeckis' love affair with special effects, which in this case involves the same motion capture technology he employed in ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf."" This allows for the creation of characters caught in that delightful gray zone between real and unreal. Some are more exaggerated than others; Scrooge - a little too tall, a little too thin, a little too hunched over - is a menacing physical representation of his own anger and resentment. The Ghost of Christmas Past, an elfin wraith with a breathy voice and a head made of fire, is as slight, slender, and soft-spoken as a candle. The Ghost of Christmas Present is a loud and jovial Father Christmas figure, whose laugh is just as big as his body, perhaps bigger. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is a silent yet frightening skeletal phantom made out of shadows.

Scrooge and the Ghosts are all played by Jim Carrey, which hardly comes as a shock since he has an affinity for variety of character and over the top performances. Other actors include Gary Oldman as Bob Crachit, Tiny Tim, and Jacob Marley, whose postmortem appearance in Scrooge's bedchamber is intensely creepy, just as it should be. Robin Wright Penn plays both Scrooge's younger sister, Fen, and his neglected fiance, Belle. Bob Hoskins plays old Fezziwig, a man so thoroughly in the Christmas spirit that he and his wife defy gravity as they dance. Colin Firth plays Scrooge's hopelessly optimistic nephew Fred, quite possibly the only person who thinks his uncle is worth addressing in a friendly manner.

As Scrooge is taken on his journey of redemption, both he and the audience are treated to fantastic aerial tours of London, with shots that swoop and soar over rooftops, through windows, and around street corners. 3-D technology, normally so unimpressive, is here perfectly utilized, allowing for one of the most immersive environments of any recent animated film. One of the most stunning sequences involves a spectral carriage chasing a shrunken Scrooge up and down dark, snowy cobblestone streets; it's not only an astounding visual achievement, it's also an exhilarating thrill ride. Harkening back to the roller coaster train sequences created for ""The Polar Express,"" Zemeckis proves that you should stick with what works best.

There are also some equally effective quiet moments, such as the opening shot, which pays homage to classic Disney animated films with the opening of a book. Other moments are surprisingly powerful, as when a grieving Bob Cratchit, his eyes red with tears, seems to be staring directly at Scrooge even though he can't really see him (Cratchit, in that moment, is nothing more than a vision of the future). I also appreciated the shot of doomed ghosts floating just outside Scrooge's window; some of them act humorously, banging their heads against their chain boxes, and yet we can't help but feel sorry for them.

The entire film embodies a darker, shivery tone - not to the point of becoming a computer-animated horror film, but certainly beyond the colorful whimsy of the average Christmas special. This, I believe, truly captures the tone of Dickens' original story, which doesn't spare the reader the hardships of destitution, disease, and loss. Consider Bob Cratchit's family; they do make merry of themselves on Christmas Day, but they also live a meager existence, and there's always the sense that, should nothing about their situation change, they could end up with even less.

Robert Zemeckis created a perennial holiday classic with ""The Polar Express,"" and I think he may have done it again with ""A Christmas Carol."" Yes, we have seen this movie before, and yes, its message is far from original. But there's no denying the fact that it's sending a good message, where love, compassion, and the possibility of hope reign supreme. There's also no denying that, with visuals this striking, it practically begs to be seen, especially in 3-D. This is one of the year's best looking animated films, so richly detailed, so sharply defined, so gloriously shot. It creates a mood, effectively evoking feelings of warmth and tenderness without becoming sappy or mindlessly cheerful. That above all made seeing this film an absolutely beautiful experience, one that I recommend to everybody.",1257552000,17,5123,5.035377358490566
4157594,5,B003NFM3JK,"""A Christmas Carol"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Ebenezer Scrooge begins the Christmas holiday with his usual miserly contempt, barking at his faithful clerk and his cheery nephew. But when the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come take him on an eye-opening journey revealing truths Old Scrooge is reluctant to face, he must open his heart to undo years of ill will before it's too late.

The cast led by Jim Carrey (as Scrooge / Ghost of Christmas Past / Scrooge as a Young Boy / Scrooge as a Teenage Boy / Scrooge as a Young Man / Scrooge as a Middle-Aged Man / Ghost of Christmas Present / Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come) is excellent! The screenplay (based on Charles Dickens' novel) & directing by Robert Zemeckis (also produced) (who also directed ""The Polar Express"" (2004, also produced and wrote the screenplay), the ""Back To The Future"" (1985, also wrote the story and screenplay, 1989, also wrote the story & 1990, also wrote the story), ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988), ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), ""Contact"" (1997, also produced), ""Cast Away"" (2000, also produced), ""What Lies Beneath"" (2000, also produced), & ""Beowulf"" (2007, also produced) is excellent!

The music by Alan Silvestri (who also did the music to Zemeckis' films since ""Romancing The Stone"" (1984), he also did the music to ""G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra"" (2009) & ""Night At The Museum: Battle Of The Smithsonian"" (2009) is excellent! The cinematography by Robert Presley (who also did the cinematography to ""The Polar Express"" & ""Beowulf"") is excellent! The film editing by Jeremiah O'Driscoll (who also did the film editing to ""The Polar Express"" & ""Beowulf"") is excellent! The casting by Scot Boland, Victoria Burrows (both of did the casting to ""The Polar Express"" & the upcoming ""The Lovely Bones"" (2009) & Nina Gold (who also did the casting to ""Bewoulf"") is excellent! The production design by Doug Chiang (who also did the production design to ""The Polar Express"" & ""Beowulf"") is excellent! The art direction by Marc Gabbana (who was a concept artist on ""The Polar Express"" & ""Beowulf"") & Mike Stassi (who was an assistant art director on the upcoming ""Avatar"", ""The Polar Express"" & ""Bewoulf""), he also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Alice In Wonderland"" (2010) is excellent! The set decoration by Karen O'Hara (who also did the set decoration to the upcoming ""Alice In Wonderland"", ""What Lies Beneath"", ""Cast Away"", ""The Polar Express"" & ""Beowulf"") is excellent!

This is an excellent telling of Charles Dickens' novel and one of the best telling of Scrooge's story ever made as a movie. This is another motion-capture hit for Zemeckis. Jim Carrey is impressive in 8 roles that were given to him by Zemeckis.",1257552000,3,2724,4.879049676025918
4157595,3,B003NFM3JK,"When you see Jim Carrey portraying a lot of characters in a movie, you get excited because you know the potential he has when creativity is allowed (The Mask, for example). Unfortunately, this movie doesn't take advantage of their star. As a matter of fact, practically anyone could have played the roles he was given with the same excitement.

The effects here are amazing, and the computer animation is wonderful. Their treatment of Marley's Ghost is by far the best of any Christmas Carol movie I've seen. It's actually scary, which is good. However, Jim's performance as Scrooge and the ghosts seems basically phoned in. He's playing the characters pretty much standard as any other version of the film. His interpretation of the Ghost of Christmas Past is actually the weakest I've seen (their decision for his overall design was strange anyway). This is one time they probably would have come off better to just let him play Scrooge and give the ghosts to someone else. Gary Oldham does a great job as Cratchit and Marley, actually stealing the show from Carrey's generic Scrooge.

Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting Scrooge to play like Ace Ventura or anything, but it would have been nice to see a little spark of fun in there somewhere. It seemed to me that Carrey was actually bored with the roles (since this was motion captured from him).

Still, it's nice to see ""A Christmas Carol"" on screen again. This is pretty much a fairly standard version of the story and probably won't be considered ""must see"" for the holiday season after this year (like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or even other versions of ""Christmas Carol""), but it was nice to see the 3D take on it.",1257552000,6,1676,4.713310580204778
4157596,3,B003NFM3JK,"I saw A Christmas Carol today at the new IMAX theater at the local AMC 24. While the screen was a little smaller than the IMAX theater I went to in the past, the less confined seating was much more relaxing and picture quality seemed to be even better. Seeing this in digital 3-D is the only way to go. This story has been told a million times before and while it's still a great one, I felt a little bored at times. I miss the days when Robert Zemeckis made films with real actors on the screen, not just the animated versions of them. I will admit that it has come a long way since The Polar Express, but those eyes still have a creepy dead look to them. Jim Carrey is very restrained, especially for him, and made a Scrooge to remember. He also plays The Ghost of Christmas Past and Present. This film is way too scary for kids. I know if I was little and saw this, I wouldn't sleep for nights. It's weird that they released this just one week after Halloween, but if you want to get in the Christmas spirit way too early, this is a very faithful adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic.",1257552000,,1092,4.180094786729858
4157597,5,B003NFM3JK,"...Sometimes creepy even. Ask the ghost of Christmas past.

Going in, I wondered what this latest version of a Christmas Carol would have to offer, to differentiate itself from other versions. Songs? Crazy characters? Turns out that a lot of the fun here is the 3-D. The ariel view  throughout becomes like a ride through the streets of Jolly old England, circa 1836. Horse and buggys, street beggars, dogs... cool stuff. Zemekis pays close attention to details throughout, giving us a great sense of the dark, dismal, and the cold.

Perfect set up for the widest array of ghostly scenes I think I've ever experienced in another Christmas Carol. Including Scrooge being chased around by a roaring Death Cab. Around Stave IV.

I have a feeling that Zemekis may have lifted a few one-liners from Mr. Magoos 1962 opus version, but other than that, he follows the book very tightly, and offers a unique interpretation of the story. He still hasn't figured out how to CGI the eyes straight entirely in his work, but he puts this sqiff to use, in characters like Marleys Ghost, who does a neat trick with his eyes in one scene... oh yeah, and when he unties his jaw.. hillarious!

I'm a big fan of a lot of Christmas Carols in general so I can't say its the best version I've ever seen; But this is a top shelf experience... see it in 3-D, so you can enjoy ""the ride.""",1257552000,2,1362,4.542857142857143
4157598,5,B003NFM3JK,"As a fan of Charles Dickens (not only the Christmas Carol but all his works) I was very excited to see a new rendition of this Christmas classic.  I had high expectations with Jim Carrey performing Scrooge and the ghosts and I am very happy to say, I was not disappointed.  I won't clutter this review with much detail about the story, afterall, we all know it.

The look of the movie in 3D is absolutely wonderful.  3D is either a success or a disappointment and in this film it's a success in my opinion.  It looks amazing, it's not just some doctored scenes with items pointing out at you...it's a full environmental experience.  The movie in its entirety is visually stunning.

The story is very well told, it starts just as the book begins with Scrooge signing Marley's death certificate and unlike many renditions there is no narration through out..the story unfolds before your eyes and is told through the characters.  Jim Carrey is wonderful as the ghosts and Scrooge, in some instances I wouldn't even have realized it was his voice if I hadn't already known it.  Gary Oldman voices Bob Cratchit, that was a nice surprise.

The ghosts travels with Scrooge were the best that I've seen and the most visually stunning, they do have an advantage with it not being live action and this also adds an appeal for younger children, making this rendition fit for the entire family. This story really is about hope and change and the ""magic"" of Christmas.  Robert Zemekis did a wonderful job here and he definately deserves a nod for understanding what this story is about.

Also one more note: we got to see a 3D preview of the new movie Avatar and three other upcoming films, so make sure you arrive early, there are several previews in 3D that are exciting to see as well, so don't miss them waiting in line for popcorn.

This film is a great way to start your holiday season.  So as Tiny Tim observed...God Bless Us, Everyone!",1257552000,4,1930,4.5726744186046515
4157599,5,B003NFM3JK,"This animated adaptation of Charles Dickens', ""A Christmas Carol,"" could well become the classic film version to 21st century kids as the Alistair Sims ""Scrooge"" became in the 1950s.  The animation is so 19th century authentic that it actually is continually illustrating the Victorian classic book.  It is true to the Dickens words and spirit.  From the beginning it is a visual-experiencing of olde London.  All that is missing is the smell of coal smoke and horse dung.

It is not just Jim Carrey (Scrooge, 3 ghosts, & more) and Gary Oldman (Cratchit, Marley, Tiny Tim) that so passionately do the unforgettable characters' voices. Colin Firth, a necessary for any top quality Victorian London story, as Ebenezer's nephew Fred's voice, is animated to look the most like himself.

Animated sets are thrilling and punctuated with moments like sliding down hilly iced-over cobblestone back streets, the coal soot patina on 1840s shops, and animated London fog looking more atmospheric than the real thing. Scrooge's bony fingers are as true-to-life as on an emaciated elderly man near death. Scrooge is himself a bit ghostly; like a more aged Lemony Snicket. And about as darkly evil.
____(Excuse the name dropping, but with any great film--it is bound to be compared to other accomplishments.) Like the aerial flight through time where Scrooge is hand-held by a ghost.  It recalls images of Mary Martin in ""Peter Pan.""

The 2nd 'Scottish' Spirit's home was a Victorian Christmas visual masterpiece of delight; and the trip through Christmas Present, more like floating with ""Mary Poppins.""  Spirit of the Future's trip adventure, however, depicted more peril than anything ""Indiana Jones"" ever encountered. Action! Misadventure! Fear!

This film is technically animated beyond ""Polar Express.""  Characters' hair, snow & ice, and the Cratchit Christmas goose are all as aesthetically fine and real as any photography.

The only negative for this adaptation to Dickens' Christmas Spirits' story is the inability to push a ""play"" button on a remote for a second viewing. I can't wait for a DVD version (next year?). For now, it's back to the box office.

IT'S A CLASSIC-both book and film.  Don't do this Christmas without seeing it.  It's perfect for our economic times: the underlying theme that Christmas is about giving and family.  Take your family (as long as the kids are beyond 2nd grade). Preschoolers and early-elementary age might be frightened.  Remember the Dickens story is a bit on the dark side till the end.

Don't leave till after the credits.  The song sung by Andrea Bocelli, ""God Bless Us Everyone"", (writers: Alan Silvestri, Glen Ballard) is at the end.  It could/SHOULD be on this year's Top-10 Christmas Song list.  Hear the words--they summarize the meaning of the story of Ebenezer.

Anyone know, is that song on a CD yet?

4157600,5,B003NFM3JK,"I went to the midnight show of Disney's 'A Christmas Carol' last night and going into it, I was really excited. I was lucky enough to see the train tour that went around the country to promote the film and even got to see director Robert Zemeckis talk about the film at the D23 Expo. I'm a big fan of the Charles Dickens story as well, of course my two favorite film versions star Kermit the Frog and Mickey Mouse.

Disney's new motion capture film is wonderful! I absolutely loved it, and I'm usually not a fan of motion capture. Jim Carrey is fabulous as Scrooge and the three ghosts. This adaptation is more faithful to the Charles Dickens classic than any other film version. In fact, it even begins with the opening of the book. And I found the 3D to be more impressive than Disney's previous 3D releases. In this film, items appear to pop off the screen and into the theater.

Overall, I loved this new version and will definitely see it again in theaters. However, I must warn anybody with small children that this film is scary. In fact, it made me jump twice. I have to say that my favorite film version is still 'The Muppet Christmas Carol,' mainly because it's fun and has a lighter tone, but this new version is very good. This is sure to become an annual tradition for families to watch every holiday season.",1257465600,4,1321,4.409836065573771

4157603,3,B003NFM3JK,"Jim Carrey.  Jim Carrey.  Jim Carrey.  Dude is talented and also a little weird and the weirdness factor is increased by the mo-cap pixelated likeness.  But despite the ability of the CGI to do more visually to make this more magical it actually feels less magical because the other side characters are not realized in important ways.  The focus and love and attention is so much on Carrey's CGI looks and mo-cap performance that they lost the heart of this film and it loses its footing.  For this movie, despite it dealing with ghosts and visions, is best when it is extremely grounded in the emotions of the characters.  And the unreality of the CGI simply detracts from those emotional elements.  It's not Carrey's fault.  The movie is a close-up focus of Scrooge and that's what they do but there's too much pandering to him and too little development of the other characters and they don't draw out his redemption long enough.  I think that every version of this Christmas and literary classic has been better.  2.75 stars.",1523750400,,1029,4.724719101123595

4157684,5,B003NFM3JK,"Just saw it now and  is certainly the best version of A Christmas Carol ever. Majestic, dark, thrilling, compelling, and with an ever powerful social message.
Scrooge a cold-hearted and tightfisted miser. He despises all that brings joy and comfort and above all denies social responsibility for the less fortunate in society. After sending away his nephew and spurning his Christmas dinner invitation and after turning dwon a request from some people from a benevolent society for a charitable donation (He says 'Are there not workhouses, are there not prison?' - arguments used by modern libertarians)  He is terrorized by the ghost of his deceased business partner Jacob Marley.
Suitably scary haunting scenes with Marley and the arrival of the ghosts. Tear jerking moments like the  feared death of Tiny Tim.and the full atmosphere created, highlights include the majestic force of the Ghost of Christmas Present , and the message of the spirits of want and of ignorance reminding Scrooge of his own cruelty.

4157698,1,B003NFM3JK,"My review is not of the content of the film, but the sound mixing on this purchase from Amazon video. My Samsung TV is a 2015 model with volume levels from 0-100. I rarely have to put the volume louder than 20-25 to hear any TV show or film adequately. I had to turn this all the way up to 80 to hear it worth a damn, and then, whenever a moment of loudness like his visit with Marley or his argument with Belle or when the Ghost of Christmas Past rockets him into the atmosphere, I have to turn the volume down by 40 notches to avoid the sound traveling to other rooms in my house.

I'm not certain if this a problem unique to the Amazon Video format of this film or the film studio's mixing of the film, but it's a pretty miserable watching experience, either way.

4157763,5,B003NFM3JK,"A Christmas Carol is one of my favorite holiday films and I own several versions of it. Disney does an impressive job with the tale, but I believe the idea of a 3D film got the best of them. First off, I am not a fan of 3D, I find it more of a distraction than an asset. There are a few films that really benefit from the process, but they are few and far between.

Many scenes are set up for 3D in this version so when watching the standard version some small scene seem a little odd. Not enough to hurt the film any, but it was noticeable to me. Disney's stays pretty faithful to the original story, but strays a bit too much towards the end. I don't mind some embellishments to breath some life into the story for children, but I found the last chase sequence to be overkill. It would have worked better to shorten the chase and lengthen the ending which seemed too abrupt. For me, Scrooges change of heart is the most inspiring event in the entire story, but in Disney's version' we never see the Cratchit family's reaction to Scrooges sudden generosity, he doesn't stop by to give Mr. Cratchit his raise or vista with Tiny Tim and the family.

The film is also a bit scary for young children, not that this is anything new for Disney, they have been giving kids nightmares ever since Snow White, Pinocchio, Bambi and Dumbo. My point is, if you're going to scare the kiddies, then at least have a little longer redemption in the ending.  Overall i really enjoyed this version and I can see me watching it during the holiday season as an alternate to the many version I own. The Blu Ray looks fabulous and the bonus material is very interesting and extensive. If you're a fan of this film, but the Blu Ray, if you're into 3D I would imagine it is very impressive.",1493078400,,1766,4.297297297297297

It may not be best for very small children, but it is more exciting for the older ones, following the story of Scrooge and making it more age appropriate. Disney may add to the story and expand some parts, but the children will learn the basic story and get the meaning that Dickens intended. References to Scrooge in literature are endless, so children need to understand his character and his redemption.",1489449600,,434,4.7105263157894735

4157778,5,B003NFM3JK,"First I will start by saying that I never give spoilers in any of my movie reviews. I keep it simple and say whether it is good or not.

I purchased this movie mainly just to add another 3D title to my movie collection. So needless to say, I had it for quite a while before ever viewing it. But now, after viewing this movie, I wish I had watched it sooner! I found the movie very well done. The story line was entrancing and at times a real treat. I would consider this to be a great movie for the entire family, although the very young ones at around 6 or younger might find it a little frightful at times. Also I must add, this movie would be enjoyable any time of the year!
 The 3D aspect was done very well. I have seen better but by no means was this done poor. There where a few times when the 3D was a little underwhelming, and I may have noticed a slight ghosting here and there (notice the pun there ;) LOL) But all in all a pretty decent 3D rendering is what you can expect. Please keep on mind that not all 3D Televisions are made the same and some 3D TV's just aren't very good at rendering decent 3D. Luckily we have one of the good 3D TV's. So when a great 3D movie is played on our television, it is a very special treat, as we can expect it to play just about as good as the theatre can provide us. I have a large collection of 3D films and have viewed most of them, so please trust my advice when I say that this particular 3D movie is a good one.

I will sum this review up with this advice. If you are at all on the fence about whether you should buy this movie or not, I would suggest you do, and enjoy it.

4157804,4,B003NFM3JK,"Not a bad version! Adheres very closely to Dickens, with a few homages to earlier movie versions.

The only negative was the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come part. There was a rather long scene with Scrooge being chased by a hearse. It dragged on endlessly and had little value to the story. Also, at the end of this scene, Scrooge shrinks down to about six inches tall and talks in a squeaky voice. Christmas Carol meets the Borrowers? I think not!

A bit darker than some versions. The Ghost of Christmas Present actually dies at the end of his scene and turns into a skeleton that decays to dust. Ignorance and Want grow up into a young thug and an insane prostitute. A good extrapolation of what Dickens was trying to say with these symbols, but a bit lurid and possibly upsetting to children (if any happen to be watching).

Overall, a great new take on an old classic. Next to Patrick Stewart's version, which is incredible, I'd say it's right up there with the best.",1486339200,4,971,4.47457627118644

I doubt that Dickens intended it for the very young.  It has some scary scenes, and Scrooge is not a handsome man.  That being said, it is a film for adults and older children (pre-teens and up).  Fans of The Polar Express will recognize a similarity in the art work.

4157835,4,B003NFM3JK,"The 3D is excellent.  It was done in the same way as Avatar and the Polar Express.  Actors motions were digitized and then they were clothed in animated skins, so there are no glitches common in 3D conversions.  The result is a very realistic 3D animation.  My only reservation is that this is a bit over the top.  The chase scene and moon shot were added for the gee-whiz effect.  The chase scene would be much too scary for young children.  They claimed that they could achieve effects that were not in the original Dickens.  Actually they added effects that were definitely not in the original.  For example Scrooge did not fall backwards flat when confronted by Marely's face on the knocker.  However the flying scene with the ghost of Christmas past is quite in keeping with the original story.  If they had omitted some of the over the top additions, they could have included things like the Ghost of Christmas present visiting miners and adding savor to the dinners of the poor.  Jim Carey not only acted Scrooge, but also the three ghosts!

It will not replace the more accurate Alastair Sim version. Now if we could have an accurate 3D version with a strong flavor of the original drawings, that would be wonderful.  I did like the depiction of the Ghost of Christmas future, but I would have preferred Scrooge clutching him and having him turn into the bed curtains, rather than tumbling Scrooge.  The ides of having Scrooge travel looking through the floor of his room was very nice, but it kept the ghost and Scrooge a bit distant from the action.  So the ghost could not sprinkle the food of the poor.",1484006400,2,1614,4.590909090909091

4157842,4,B003NFM3JK,"Of the many interpretations of Charles Dickens ""The Christmas Carol"", DIsney's is the most faithful to the original. From the very start you see that the movie is in the same time period as the book. Along with the time period, nearly all of the movie's characters fit Dicken's descriptions perfectly. From Scrooge who was described as a 'cold hearted man who speaks in a shrewd voice and despises Christmas."" To the ghost of Christmas present who Dickens described as,"" a ""Jolly Giant"" with dark brown curls. He wears a fur lined coat and a holy wreath."" Along with the descriptions of characters, the movie has a nearly identical story as the novel. From the introduction, to the Spirits' visitsit seems that Disney took some real inspiration from the original novel. Another detail that stayed exactly the same was Scrooge's character arc, from grumpy geezer to a jolly,giddy school boy. However there was one main difference, which was the expansion of the Third Spirits' visit. Originally, in the book Scrooge visits a old london pawnshop where some of Scrooge's colleagues try to sell his old posessions and later on the Third Spirit shows Scrooge his grave in the near future. However, in the movie Disney includes these scenes but adds more. Including Bob Cratchit and Scrooge's nephew's reaction to Scrooge's death. I think the movie's expansions increased Scrooge's character depth since it shows him how other people would react when he died and when he saw how happy his nephew was to see him die. This and the gravestone were the pushing point for Scrooge that finally made him want to change. In conclusion, Disney stayed faithful to Dickens' original work with several quotes, character descriptions/arcs and similar scenes. However the largest difference between the movie and the novel was the expansion of the Third Spirits' visit which increases the volume of Scrooge's transformation.",1483574400,,1904,5.06687898089172
4157843,4,B003NFM3JK,"This is one of the better movie adaptations of A Christmas Carol as it says very true to the original by Charles Dickens while still adding a nice touch here and there. The dialogue is nearly perfect, it is almost as if Jim Carry (the voice of Scrooge) was reading from the story and not a script. Other minor things such as the church bells in the background are all there as well. The plot is also very close to the original with a few touches like (spoilers) when tiny Scrooge is being chased by the third spirit riding on a black carriage or scenes that are drawn out to add atmosphere or just lengthen the movie.

Some scenes may be scary for small children such as the ghost of Marley when his jaw hangs loosely from his mouth (although this is brief and afterward the ghost then moves it up and down to talk in a comedic way). Also, the ghost of Christmas yet to come could be frightening as he looks like the grim reaper and is definitely intended to be scary. Overall, I would say 7-9 years old depending on the kids maturity would be a good age to watch this.

Is it a good movie? Yes, I would say it was a good movie maybe a little too scary for kids and overall has a sad atmosphere until the end which I thought was nice and cheery. My favorite ghost was definitely the first as I thought that ghost was most true to the original story and very close to what I imaged while reading the story. My biggest complaint is the lack of character Jim Carey gives Scrooge and that Scrooge doesn't seem to change quite as much throughout the movie as he does in Dickens original story.",1483574400,,1588,4.237623762376238
4157844,5,B003NFM3JK,"The movie was great! It was possibly the best representation of the story yet. It almost perfected the line between being dark ( to represent Scrooges point of view) and still staying very christmas like. It was just like the original story with many quotes from the book appearing in the movie. Such as Scrooges partner in business Marley being ""dead as a door nail"" and many other quotes said by the christmas spirits. They also represented the spirits exactly as how i imagined them in the book especially the spirit of christmas present with the book describing him as a very large and jolly man wearing a large robe and the movie did just that! All in all this is the best representation of the story by far and keeping the stories feel intactl.",1483574400,,750,4.562962962962963
4157845,3,B003NFM3JK,"It is a great movie!  It is very similar to the book and quotes many things from Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol.  It is about Ebenezer Scrooge, who it a very rich man, but hates spending any money.  He also dislikes Christmas and hates watching everyone else being merry during the holiday season.  On Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by the ghost ofhis dead business partner, Jacob Marley.  Later that night, Scrooge is visited by three ghosts of Christmas: past, present, and yet to come.  The ghosts shows Scrooge many things and the more he sees the more he feel happy and also worried about the future.  Once the ghosts are gone, it is Christmas day and Scrooge realizes what he has to do to change the future.  The movie has the exact same plot as the book.  I feel that there could have been more things from the book instead of the long horse chase with the ghost of Christmas yet to come, I also felt that there was to much flying around with the ghosts.  The movie was very good at showing Scrooge slowly change from being a mean and lonely person to a joyful and happy one.  There are some parts that aren't in the book at all, like when Scrooge shrinks while he is with the ghost of yet to come, it is still a good movie though.  Even though it's supposed to be a ghost story, it may be a little scary for families with younger children.",1483574400,,1354,4.329365079365079

4157879,4,B003NFM3JK,"As others have noted, the most glaring shortfall with this video is the extremely low sound volume.  I watched on my notebook, first with built-in speakers, then with wireless earphones, and then with an amplified external speaker near my ear.  The only way I could finally catch all of the dialog and phrases was to use the subtitles along with the audio.  I find that flaw a real shame, because the rest of the experience of this video is exceptional.  I almost never purchase videos, but after seeing this one on a televised broadcast a couple Christmas' ago, I have wanted to experience it again but never located another broadcast of it.  Finally, this Christmas, I gave up and just bought it.  I am not a movie critic, so can't assess the various technical criticisms of the film, but I can say that I find the ""motion capture animation"" technique extremely appealing--providing an ideal mix between pure film and animation to give a development to characters and backgrounds that can't be achieved with direct filming, and yet the sense of realism that that is not present with pure animation.  The overall result (in my opinion) is a tremendous 5-star video experience which must regretfully be reduced because of the flaw with the audio.",1482883200,,1246,4.821596244131455

4157897,1,B003NFM3JK,"I loved Polar Express and am a great devotee of Christmas Carol (must have seen the George C Scott version close to 100 times), so I wanted to give this a chance. But unfortunately, this has to be the absolute worst version I have ever seen. Someone, they managed to turn a Christmas story into a hybrid of action/adventure and horror movie, complete with chases and gratuitous violence. What is missing is the soul of the story, which is about love for one another and our world, redemption, and the meaning of Christmas.

If I had never read the book or seen any other versions, I really would be lost and not have a real clue what this story was about. There was so much missing from it, and all of the warmth has been sucked out of the story. I am amazed to see so many 5 star reviews--so I have to wonder, are these people who just like special effects and find movies like Christmas Carol boring without them? Is this a reflection of the amount of violence in our movies in general, so people are okay with Scrooge getting tossed around, chased at full speed by phantom horses (the Victorian version of a car chase), dropped from space and crashing into the floor, battered around, etc---all things that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story? The ghosts were all somewhat violent, and almost everything that happened had some degree of a ""chase"" or scaring Scrooge, or was just downright macabre. These extra scenes and add ons came at the expense of cutting out important parts of the story and developing it. The ghosts don't come to scare Scrooge, they come to allow him to revisit his life and see how he turned into the bitter man that he is, and they show him hope of redemption. He changes not because he was bullied or terrified into it, but because he sees what he has lost and that there is still time to change. But in this version, that is precisely what happens--he is attacked, chased, bullied, terrified--over and over and over--until it becomes downright idiotic. The is a beautiful classic story, and while parts of the original novella are dark, it does not need special effects. Or violence. Or spirits turning into skeletons. Or any of this other nonsense done to heighten the ""entertainment"" value.

Overall, this movie just seems like an effort by the producers to show off their animation technology, and appeal to the video game crowd, because that's what this reminded me of. We stopped it about 3/4 way through, after Scrooge is being chased by horse drawn hearse through London, and then shrinks to about 6 inches in height, goes flying through the sewers, and then takes a roller coaster ride on an icicle--just what Dickens had in mind. Fortunately, we didn't waste any money purchasing this.

Also a warning--this is not a movie to show to young children. The ghost scenes are really over the top, and will scare children.",1482710400,,2865,4.62475442043222

The images in the first 20 minutes were so disturbing within the first 20 minutes, we turned it off.  Based off the reviews, -and owing to the fact that this is a Disney movie, I thought I'd be safe showing it to my kids.  Watching a corpse's jaw dislocate is not my idea of family friendly.

4157920,3,B003NFM3JK,"This may be the first thing (other than The Mask) that I could tolerate Jim Carrey beyond five minutes. Indeed, had I not seen his name on the credits I would not have known. So props to him. I loved Zemeckis' efforts with The Polar Express so really looked forward to this one. The style he used carried over, quite well I think. And, parents be warned. This isn't Disney's Muppet Christmas carol. It is much darker, and could be scary to some. Indeed, it honors, somewhat, Dickens' subititle that this is a ghost story. What disappointed me was that a great opportunity was missed to present the entire story. If so, it might have rivaled the 1951 B&W classic with Alistar Sims as Scrooge. Instead, it was edited and in the edits, they left out one of the greatest bits in which Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past visit Fezziwig's establishment. After watching Fezziwig and his family and employees (including a young Scrooge) make merry, taking on Scrooge's attitude, the spirit scoffs at the waste of money. As Dickens wrote:
""A small matter,"" said the Ghost, ""to make these silly folks so full of gratitude.""
""Small!"" echoed Scrooge.
The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had done so, said,
""Why! Is it not! He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?""
""It isn't that,"" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self. ""It isn't that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count them up: what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.""
There is so much truth there in the power of kindness, and especially in our own society today post-election (and during). Indeed, organizational leaders might draw a lot from taking Scrooge's comments on Fezziwig to heart.  Yet---for some reason that part of the carol was omitted. Dickens' use of Fezziwig's kindness toward others was juxtaposed against Scrooge's hard-heartedness to clearly contrast the two outlooks that, at least to me, it weakens the rationale for repentance at the end when Scrooge learns the name on the tombstone.
As a result, the best I can give it is ""it's OK."" A golden opportunity was missed here.",1482364800,,2520,4.650224215246637

4157989,5,B003NFM3JK,I've seen this version of A Christmas Carol a few times now and think that it's extremely underrated. The story moves along briskly but remains true to Dickens' source material. The voice work is great and the animation is phenomenal and ultra realistic looking. Most recently watched it with my wife and girls (ages 3 & 10) and they also loved it! I highly recommend this Xmas film to anyone looking for a good holiday movie. *Side note ... it may be a little intense in some parts for the kids out there that frighten a tad more easily so beware.

4157991,4,B003NFM3JK,"To those reviewers who panned this movie because it was not suitable for children to watch should keep in mind that Dickens did not intend the story for  small children in the first place. Not being a huge fan of Jim Carrey or animated versions of this wonderful, ADULT story, I did not expect to like this very much. I am happy to say that I was quite wrong. While I do agree with some of the reviews that mentioned the long, drawn-out ""chase scene"" with the hearse (made to make the 3D fans happy, I'm sure), overall, this was a wonderful version of the story, ranking right up there with the ones starring Alistair Sim and George C. Scott (my all-time favorite). Jim Carrey was amazing as Scrooge and several other characters, proving to me that he doesn't always have to be a caricature of Jerry Lewis. The special effects were amazing, and the Spirits were downright terrifying at times - just as they should be.  Marley's Ghost was jaw-droppingly frightening (pun intended).  The Ghost of Christmas Past was both wistful and eerie, and the Ghost of Christmas Present was totally faithful to Dickens' description of him. His ""demise"" was one of the most powerful images of the movie. As another reviewer mentioned, I appreciated the film's depiction of the future that awaited the children Greed and Want. Finally, The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come was absolutely terrifying, a horrific shadow of Scrooge's future. This movie depicted 19th century England just as Dickens wanted us to see it - full of inequality, greed, want, poverty, and tragedy. ""A Christmas Carol"" was Dickens' warning to society to take heed of its actions during the Industrial Revolution - and this movie stays true to that purpose. No, I wouldn't let small children watch this - but for teens and adults, it should be a Christmas staple.",1481587200,,1818,4.746835443037975
4157992,1,B003NFM3JK,"What a piece of garbage! Completely devoid of any real Dickens. I can't believe I rented this BS. Hands down the worst Christmas Carol  I have ever seen. Whoever came up with this idea should have been shot at dawn. Ohhh Walt if you could only see what they've done, you'd probably roll over in your grave. This piece of crap is blasphemy to the author and the true meaning  of the writers intent.

4158015,1,B003NFM3JK,"In this day and age of cult classics and good bad movies getting more recognition than ever, its hard to really remember what exactly a bad movie is. In my opinion something like Plan 9 from Outer Space really isn't all that bad a movie. If people are still talking about it and showing it to others over fifty years later, it really cannot be all that bad.

In my opinion, a truly bad movie is a film that is bland and mediocre, like local microwavable frozen pizza from a gas station. Truly bad films can be films that are just being pumped out in the hopes who raking in a lot of money. In my eyes, they just to be films only horny teenagers unable to pay attention to the screen cannot consider a waste of their time.

Nothing inspires films like this to be made more than the holiday season. When you turn on the television and see some generic rom-com with the whitest people imaginable kissing in red sweaters as a generic Christmas song with a lot of bells begins to play in the background, it really makes you want to cancel Christmas and just celebrate Halloween for the second time this year.

One of the films that can easily go into this category is Disneys most recent rendition of A Christmas Carol.

To me, its very baffling that anybody would take a story that is regularly performed on stage and turn it into this over-bloated CGI animated movie that has a budget somewhere around 175-200 million dollars. As a fan of film, it is very infuriating to watch this movie knowing how much it costed and thinking of how many actual good films that couldve been made with all that money as I watch this animated film that already looks cheap and outdated seven years after being made.

The cast involved with this film is supreme and impressive, and its a shame that you have to watch them doing voice-overs for these lifeless computer drawings instead of actually performing it in front of a camera.

A big part of A Christmas Carol is watching Scrooges redemption at the end, the audience happily watching as this cold heartless man is transformed into someone with a new wind for the bright side of life. Due to the CGI animation, this transformation never really happens. Since the focus was on using the best technology imaginable and not focusing on the emotion behind Scrooges transformation, the Ebenezer Scrooge in this version feels just as cold and lifeless in the end as he does in the beginning, no matter what he says and does.
The best way to sum this version of A Christmas Carol up is that theres just something that feels very wrong about a story with themes revolving around poverty and greed being turned into this overpriced animated movie that was in a 3-D format when released to make even more cash.

A film such as this is lucky its a holiday film, because without stations needing a Christmas film to fill airtime, there is absolutely no way this movie would ever be watched after 2009.",1480896000,3,2923,4.524621212121212

A little darker than Mickey's Christmas Carol, but I imagine the original book was too. I think it was meant to be watched in 3D, it really did add a lot to the movie taking it from good to great for me. It reminds me of the 3D version of The Polar Express but more refined graphically.

4158125,2,B003NFM3JK,"I first saw this film when it was still in the theaters and when I came out, I thought ""It was disappointing to me."" I first saw the Christmas Carol from the 30s when I was 5 and I loved it! Then, a couple years later, I was introduced with a video called ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" and I admit I still love it. Now, I'm pretty much grown out of it I was pretty excited to see that a brand-new Christmas Carol movie was coming out. Yet, I was expecting it to be pretty funny and to be kind of a fun thrill ride. Then, when I went to the theater, I thought, ""Oh, I'll like it"" but I got bored in the middle. Obviously, the movie is NOTHING like a plain comedy or even action-adventure film. No, it turned out to be quite a thriller like the other Christmas Carol films, but I still thought it was kinda funny and somewhat fun.

Today, I saw this on STARZ and I seemed to have liked it a little better than before, but was still a horrible let-down for me. I guess I have grown out of a Christmas Carol, but I heard a lot of critical acclaims for this film and how it was well-received, but I know I'm not the only one who thought this film was embarrassing and generic. Well, you know, I could say that the visuals were nice, the script was flat, and some of the characters and even the ghosts were annoying. Yeah, I didn't like it at all very much.",1455667200,,1348,4.067669172932331

The only reason I docked it 1 star is because since its a Disney movie, with Jim Carrey as Scrooge, and being animated, I would think it would have more comedy lines, but it is very much like the original A Christmas Carol story, very serious, dark mood, not so much for kids except for the bright graphics.

Being a Dickens fan this is the first version that truly brings the novel and it's details into view. It is an annual see though I would say that Dickens is bit dark for small children. I would not recommend this for younger kids, but for kids a bit older and adults, this is a colorful, vivid and gripping rendition that has become my favorite.",1453680000,,517,4.51063829787234

Still a good film to watch with the whole family.",1453075200,,339,4.230769230769231
4158190,5,B003NFM3JK,"The first thing I thought last year when Disney's A
Christmas Carol hit the screen was ""Do we really need
yet another retelling of this story?""

It's easy to give Robert Zemeckis a break on selecting
this material for his capture performance animation.  What
he has created a is a very faithful retelling of the story that
takes place in a very lifelike animated world that is greatly
enhanced by 3D technology.

I sit and wonder who Zemeckis was making this film for.
Under the Disney banner, you would think that this would
be a ""family-friendly"" film.  However, this retelling is very
dark with very disturbing imagery and dialogue that comes
directly out of the book.  For me this was the downfall of
the film.  I could sit here and appreciate the fact that the
director didn't pander to young audiences but at the same
time I found that the film comes off as being somewhat
dull with very little emotion.  It's a wonderfully animated
film but I get the feeling that I'll be sticking with the more
uplifting classic versions for years to come.

Disney has struck gold with their first 3D digital release.
When you combine such wonderfully detailed animation
with 3D technology that really conveys a sense of depth
you have the perfect disc to demo to your family and friends.

There are wonderful 3D moments to savor here such as
the falling snow that often comes within inches of your
face.  The most bizarre sequence in the film is when
Scrooge shrinks in size.  I really disliked the fact that
the filmmakers went in this direction but I can see why....
it provides some of the best 3D moments in the film due
to its varying height perspectives.

Alas, the transfer is not perfect.  There is ghosting here,
and I think I have figured it all out.  For me, I find ghosting
in any dark scene that is lit by ambient light.  Pretty much
every 3D transfer I have seen suffers from this problem.
Some worse than others.

In the first 10 minutes as various characters assemble
in Scrooge's darkened shop lit only by candlelight, you can
see varying amounts of ghosting.  Take a look at the dance
sequence of Christmas Past at the 41 minute mark where
the camera pulls into Scrooge and Belle.  Belle's facial
features are clearly doubled.  The home of Bob Cratchit,
also very dark, provides ghosting problems.  Look when
Tiny Tim raises his cup and exclaims, ""God Bless us all!""
You can see that the cup looks doubled.  When the Ghost
of Christmas Future brings Scrooge back to the Cratchit
home and we watch a heartbroken Bob climbing the stairs
you can see ghosting.  Fortunately, these ghosting issues
are far more minimal than what I saw on The Polar Express.

I wouldn't say that there is much ""In You' Face"" moments
here, but the animation does make good use of having
objects protrude the screen without seeming like its going
for the gimmick.  Objects like snow, flame embers and
pointing fingers seemingly drift out of the display screen.

Presented in DTS-HD 5.1, I found the audio to be very
immersive featuring the score of Alan Silvestri combined
with a swirling amount of effect noises that cross every
channel such as the laughter of ghosts, the ""whooshing""
of wind or the clapping of thunder.  There is an incredible
amount of bass to be heard here.  Turn the audio up as
Marley approaches from outside Scrooge's bed chamber.
I advise the same for when the Ghost of Christmas
Present opens the floor of Scrooge's living room and
begins shifting the house in different directions. You can
really feel the floors shake.

CONCLUSION

You know, I should never have gone with a
number rating system.  There is already arguments as
to why I would give a top-rating of ""5"" to a 3D transfer
that has ghosting problems.

The reason is because this format is still in its infancy
and either the hardware or the studios can't get all the
kinks out that cause problems like ghosting.  So, sometimes
I have to put something that can't be easily be solved to
the side and look at the bigger picture.

I am ranking Disney's A Christmas Carol as one of the
best 3D transfers that is currently available despite its
minor flaws.  It may not be nearly the best telling of the
Dickens classic, but it certainly will be something that
you'll put in your Blu-ray player time and time again when
showing off your new system to family and friends.",1453075200,,4338,4.627450980392157

The animation is amazingly detailed and lovely, the characters and action engaging. Note two things, though:

- This is a serious story with horror undertones, it's a ghost story with Christmas themes. It's very tasteful, but it's definitely too scary for small kids.
- This takes the Charles Dickens story quite literally, including the dialog. I couldn't understand 70% of the dialog because of a combination of the English accent and the ornate, 19th century English that the characters spoke in.

Instead of fully enjoying this together, I found myself apologizing for all the frightening scenes (that were NOT in the book). Most of all, it felt like the message communicated was that scare-mongering can lead to a repentant spirit...not true. We can not be scared into long term change for the good.

I'm wishy washy about my rating and thought about giving it 5 stars, however I just couldn't due to some slight shortcomings.  I love how the movie starts and the scenery they depict.  I think the atmosphere is about as close to the book as any film could have or has come.  Finally this version got the feel of the ghosts right.  I love the Jacob Marley depiction and all three ghosts.  In particular I like the Ghost of Christmas Past.  He finally made sense.  The other versions I've seen have made lame attempts to capture the spirit of this Ghost, but in my opinion have failed.  I like how the Ghost of Christmas Present stays in the same room, but makes it transparent to see the world around them.  The Ghost of Christmas Future was equally good and I loved how they portrayed him more as a shadow.  But I don't see as much of this ghost, or the future, as I wanted.  They get too wrapped up in the carriage chase and we don't see as much of the future as we want or as is in the book.  This is one of the shortcomings.  Some other shortcomings, are that pieces are left out here and there and some parts breezed through too quickly.  This is probably due to trying to keep the movie a bit shorter, perhaps for the kiddies, which I'm assuming they were marketing this movie for.  I wish this movie was extended and included all the parts, which seem significant, to me.  It is not what one may expect for a Disney type movie, being overly silly or childlike, but portrays some of the darker parts of this story pretty well.  In the end, I really enjoy this version more than any other and look forward to it each year.  I just wanted a little more out of it.",1449532800,,1718,4.246913580246914

4158280,5,B003NFM3JK,Good movie that is a little better in 3D. Got it on sale so it was a great deal for a 3D movie. Definitely worth getting if you have a 3D movie collection. Rent it first if you haven't seen it. I consider this to be more of an adult animation than a young child animation. Every movie version of this story changes or omits things that were in the book so some may like this version. I enjoyed it. It is well done and the animation is excellent. Other reviews go into story details so I won't. Let it suffice to say it's well done and worth the price.,1445558400,3,551,4.0181818181818185

4158330,5,B003NFM3JK,"Charles Dickens is an author whose works deserve to be read. He was taken from his parents as a boy, and forced to live in a 'work-house' to pay-off his family's debt. So he knows all-too-well of what he writes. This version of Christmas Carol is visually true to the book in many ways that other versions previously could not be, largely because of new technology. The voices and even faces are provided by a tremendous collection of very well-known celebrities from the U.S. and the U.K. Allan Silvestri weaves traditional Christmas music through his own work of inspired genius,
and the result is a combination of all parts of this story that most seem to remember ~PLUS~ several surprises that will make you go and pick-up
the book to see what you forgot, or missed. Bob Zemekis is an inspired genius of the film industry. He wants to entertain the entire family and always remembers them when he creates films like this one. It is a Christian parable, a joyful one, with a warning to the hard-hearted. It is MAGIC.",1432857600,,1019,4.6353591160221

I pride myself on having seen all the film versions of A Christmas Carol, and this one was one of the lesser adaptations. While Jim Carrey is always a treat in any format, an over-the-top Marley and frightening end for the Ghost of Christmas Present make for dissonant scenes in what should be an engrossing tale. The added ""chase sequence"" - obviously composed only for those dense enough to think 3-D is worthwhile, or have the equipment to view it - plays like a quickie short film constructed for an amusement park attraction theater and then shoe-horned into the movie.

4158441,4,B003NFM3JK,"As for the purchase, it was smooth as silk and delivery was speedy, and the product arrived in perfect condition.

As for the movie, it isn't my cup of tea, but the recipient loves it and was thrilled to receive it as an early Christmas gift.  It is a version of Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol,"" and is visually very interesting, though even as an adult, I find it a bit creepy and not very Christmas-y (oddly, I don't feel the same about other interpretations of the classic, or even ""Scrooged"").  This movie includes several ghosts (shown as more frightening than in the cartoon version Disney made in, I believe, the 80's, so just because your kids love that, don't assume this is similar) and has a few moments that may frighten children under about 8, so parents, exercise caution when deciding whether to show this to your kids.

POTENTIAL SPOILER BELOW (on the off chance you are unfamiliar with the story)...

This story is essentially the same as the classic, with Scrooge being visited by his deceased business partner (whom we see, dead, in the opening scene), Marley.  Marley cautions Scrooge he must change his ways or, basically, be damned in hell.  He advises him the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future will visit him.  The ghosts visit, he eventually sees the error of his ways, and he repents.  It has been years since I read the novel so I may be mistaken, but I don't believe the book includes things such as Scrooge becoming an actual rat, running around in the sewer and underneath buildings, and I don't recall his maid stealing his clothing, though I again may be mistaken.

Overall, some people (including the recipient who watched it easily a dozen times in the two or so weeks between receiving it and Christmas) love this version, but I find it oddly unsettling in a way I have never before felt about other versions.  I recommend you borrow it from the library or watch it on tv before purchasing it, in case you feel as I do.",1421712000,,1971,4.602857142857143

The only thing that bothered me was actually the special features. In the ""making of"" featurette, they have this college professor touting how faithful this version is. She lists a few examples of things from the book that are in this movie, but none of them are actually in the book!

The plastic container was sealed, but all the four disks were dirty. Unfortunately, I didn't notice that initially and tried to play 3D br disk, which clogged the player's lenses immediately.
The dust seems to be statically charged 'cause after I cleaned the br disk, put it back into the casing and took it out the next day, it was covered in dust again.

Sent it back for a refund. Had to spend an extra $12 on the cleaning kit and run cleaning procedure a few times to get my br player to recognize and play any br disks again.",1419811200,3,760,4.277777777777778

4158530,3,B003NFM3JK,"I enjoyed parts of this version of the classic tale. I wanted to enjoy it more, but the animation of Marley early on with his jaw popping and dropping was rather disgusting and not appropriate for small children. I also didn't care for the ways they presented the first two spirits, or the unnecessary chase scene with the third spirit. The classic story is quite good enough on its own without having to take quite so many modernized liberties.

4158545,3,B003NFM3JK,"This is a movie I REALLY wanted to like.  As the movie started, I was very impressed by the quality of the animation, the careful adherence to the dialog of the original book, and in particular, the characterization of Scrooge by Jim Carey, who does an amazing job of emulating the performance of the great Alistair Sim from the 1950s version.  During the portions of the movie where the human characters interact, it's beautifully done.  When the supernatural characters are introduced, the movie goes totally off the rails.  Rather than maintaining the film's beautiful subtlety, exaggeration reins supreme, and  wild action sequences turn the whole thing into a spiraling video game.  The producers also go way beyond the book in the degree of vulgar horror portrayed.  Dicken's original has its dark moments, but in this movie, the encounter with Marley's Ghost, and the death of the Ghost of Christmas Present contain scenes that are absolutely gut-wrenching.  It's a sad commentary on our modern culture that movie producers think it necessary to add insane, frenetic action sequences that have no connection to the original story, and horror movie death scenes, in order to hold the audience's attention.",1419552000,,1211,5.142857142857143

4158592,2,B003NFM3JK,"Watched this version on television tonight because a family member recommended it. It did have much of the dialogue found in Dickens' story. If they'd stuck to that, it probably wouldn't have been bad for an animated movie. However, the screaming door knocker, the comic presentation of Marley's ghost (although probably frightening to some smaller children), the rocketing of Scrooge to the moon when he caps the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present turning into a laughing skeleton, that ludicrous chase with the red-eyed horses and Scrooge turning into the incredible shrinking man, all meant that while I might have watched it once, I won't be doing so again and I certainly will not add it to my collection of Christmas Carol movies, even if Jim Carrey did do a respectable imitation of Alistair Sim and sounded very Scrooge-like. I would have given it only one star, but since it's better than the travesty directed by Jason Figgis, I'm giving it two.",1419033600,,976,4.921212121212121
4158593,5,B003NFM3JK,"This version is different any other version of Charles Dickens's classic story that you have ever seen, how it is different you ask this movie was made using motion capture allowing actors to play more then one part. There has been many film versions of a Christmas Carol, and I hope that this will really be the last, I mean how can you make another film version having making one with motion capture. Jim Carrey stars in this film version where he plays Ebenezer Scrooge, and all 3 of the Christmas spirits. The movie opens with that opens, and revels that Jacob Marley was dead to begin with, and then you see Ebenezer Scrooge (Jin Carrey) speaks the first lines of the movie where he sees the corpse of his dead partner, and signs his death certificate, and soon he makes his way through London as the opening credits are seen, all the way to the counting house, where he enters. Then 7 Christmas Eves later, is where we get to the main action of the movie, where again we see Scrooge in his counting house and his employee Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman)  where his nephew and only living relative Fred (Colin Firth) pays him a visit where he invites him to Christmas dinner, but Scrooge refuses, and saying that Christmas is a humbug. He also a visit with collectors looking for donations, he turns them down saying he only supports the prisons, and the workhouses, and that anybody that would rather die had better do it. And he has them leave with no donation made, and keeps Bob working hard and paying him little money, and even to beg for a day off to spend Christmas Day with his family. He grants his wish and tells him to be earlier the next day. Scrooge returns home where he lives alone until his late partner Jacob Marley visits with chains, and warns Scrooge of what is to come if he doesn't change his ways, and that he will be haunted by 3 more spirits. This is where I leave you, watch this movie to see what happens. Stay tuned during the end credits to hear Andrea Bocelli sing God Bless Us Everyone the only song in the movie, but I would also like to warn that this movie is rated PG for parents that might want to get this movie for kids, to watch this movie with them.",1419033600,,2190,4.367647058823529

A wonderful, imaginative version of the classic.  Yeah, it has the CGI over-the-top moments, but those are offset by the quieter, and more interesting scenes such as the ghost of Christmas Present, or the celebration at Tiny Tim's home.
While it's updated with spectacular special effects especially tailored to pop out in 3-D, the script stays fairly faithful to the original story.

Coupled with the poorly executed animation of the characters and the bizarre uncanny valley effect, and you're left feeling more uncomfortable than merry.

4158618,5,B003NFM3JK,"I really enjoyed this version of A Christmas Carol.  Like most mo-cap animated features, the characters look a little zombie-eyed, but overall this one isn't bad and is more than balanced by the acting, technical execution, and soundtrack.  This version stays pretty close to the original Dickens story.  Outstanding cast!",1418515200,,322,5.4
4158619,1,B003NFM3JK,"Ugh,  probably the worst version of this classic story I have ever seen.  The ghosts are too scary and their voices are hard to understand, long drawn out action scenes that have no value to the story.  The entire redemption at the end felt rushed and missed key story points that other movies cover.  The animation was really creepy too!",1418428800,,338,4.583333333333333

There is a notation that some of the movies are being shipped without the slip cover. I did receive my movie with the slipcover.
This movie has some really good 3D effects... I thought that the snow was around me. Disney did a real good job of pulling you into the 3D world of wonder. This is perhaps one of the best movies that Jim Carrey has ever played in, but that is just my opinion, since I didn't like the comedy movies he did in the past.",1416960000,2,651,3.9393939393939394

4158725,5,B003NFM3JK,"Zemeckis has perfected the all-CG cast movies. This one is such a fun to watch, and to recognize the work of Carry and Oldman and Firth and Hoskins.

This movie is not that sort of CG cartoons where actors supply only their voices. It's actually the actors themselves wearing ""digital costumes and makeup"".

It's an Avatar of the fairy tales.

Watching it in 3D is 200% fun, the scale and the space of the stage is immerse!

I forgot that it is a full-CG fairy tale, it felt all so real, but not like in the Avatar, or in Tron, but like it has to be in a fairy tale - a fantasy sort of real.",1409356800,,591,4.068965517241379

4158729,3,B003NFM3JK,"A new season, a new holiday, and just in time for Christmas, a new re-telling of the Charles Dickens
novel, A Christmas Carol.
The book is one of the most filmed adaptations of all time; there have been over 60 film and TV
productions of A Christmas Carol. Personally, my two favorites have always been Scrooged with Bill
Murrary, and The Muppet Christmas Carol. There are not many ways to improve upon the Dickens book,
but I think one way is to add Muppets.
On Christmas Eve, Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by three spirits, plus his dead partner Jacob Marley, who
show Scrooge just how much life has to offer. He is warned to change his ways, or be doomed for all
time. Jim Carrey plays Scrooge (and several other parts). Carrey has always been a versatile actor, but he
really shines in this role. And as directed by Robert Zemeckis, the other big star of this re-telling is the
performance capture animation.
First introduced in The Polar Express, and then last years Beowulf, performance capture allows an actor
to dictate how an animated character moves and behaves. Actors wear a computerized suit to perform
their role, and can then be placed into any setting. The technology has been getting better with each film,
and the use of it here is beautiful. I would try to see this on the big screen for the animation, if for nothing
else.
One of the things I like best in this re-telling is that Carrey, because of the animation, also plays the roles
of the 3 spirits. Essentially, Scrooges own sub-conscience takes him on this journey. For the first time,
we can see how this story could all be in Scrooges head, and that only he has the power to change
himself.
I recommend this film to everyone, though I think kids could be scared by some sequences. Dealing with
ghosts, even during the holiday season, can be a frightening experience for anyone.",1408406400,,1852,4.615151515151515
4158730,4,B003NFM3JK,"I like it quite a bit. I would have given 4.5 stars but it wasn't an option. It's creepy, in a good way, lol. The animation is really astounding and the best I've seen. I love the story, and only in animation is there every freedom to create what your vision is. I liked that there was a bit of story left after he awoke still alive on Christmas day. Most of the time, the story just ends there. Jim Carrey did an excellent job, and my only deduction of 1/2 a star was because I thought the voice on the first ghost was a bit weird and forced sounding, and the second ghost just couldn't stop laughing for some strange reason. I didn't get the symbolism there. Marley's ghost flapping his own jaw was weird too, lol. But overall, the movie was very enjoyable, a bit creepy, and also very Charles Dickens come to life. I have watched only the 2D version. I can see that there were some scenes that were clearly designed for 3D but it doesn't take away from the standard version.",1408320000,,977,4.258064516129032

No disrespect to Jim Carrey, but how could he possibly represent Ebenezer Scrooge?  AMAZINGLY actually.  He does a number of other voices in the movie too, but what a fantastic Scrooge he helped create with his voice talents.  The animation was spectacular as well.  Everything about this movie was done with such care and talent.  Im telling you, if you like the story of A Christmas Carol, or Christmas movies, or just good movies in general, don't do yourself the disservice of missing out on this one.

4158834,3,B003NFM3JK,"I've seen most of the Christmas Carol television and movie versions that exist, and I usually end up watching many of them every year at some point -- a Christmas tradition I suppose! I had heard mixed things about this one, but I decided to give it a shot.
My biggest issue was I had trouble feeling any ""warmth"" from the movie. The characters weren't fleshed out very well, with the exception of Scrooge. It almost seemed like the dialogue and story was rushed a bit so we could see Scrooge get chased around or fly through the air some more. Jim Carrey did an admirable job as the old miser, but I had trouble feeling any connection with anyone else. Scrooge's nephew Fred seemed a bit more like an old school televangelist regarding Christmas than someone who truly cared for his uncle, Bob Cratchit seems to get very little screen time compared to other versions, and the visual style of everything was a rather big hindrance to me.
Frankly, even though the technology has obviously improved since the Polar Express days, I actually think the character design for this motion capture stuff was a bit worse. Realistic with a strange caricature edge... The characters didn't always have the emotion in their faces that I think would have improved the scene. A few times it felt like an older video game cutscene to me. However, the scenery was another matter. Even though Zemeckis tried his hardest to milk the 3D for all it was worth and turn everything into a chase or flying scene, digital England looked very sharp.

My biggest issue though, was with the ghosts. First things first, Marley would have made me wet my pants if I was a little kid. Granted, I was a pretty easily startled child, but I know lots of children are. Fair warning: they will hate this movie if they don't like scary/sudden things.  It was definitely one of the more intense Marley scenes around, and judging by the previews, I would not have guessed it was that dark in a movie seemingly targeted at families. Nevertheless, it was effective. I wouldn't have slept after that if I was Scrooge either.
The Ghost of Christmas Past was one of the most annoying and baffling takes on that character I've ever seen. I'm glad they included the cap in this version, but I would have used it a whole lot sooner on him. A combination of creepy, hard to understand, and just plain weird for the sake of weird.
The Ghost of Christmas Present was better, but why..did..he...have..to laugh... incessantly? It was so forced and annoying, but it was still a welcome change after the Ghost of Christmas Past. Once again things took a dark turn toward the end of his time, with the spirit's aging turning to the gruesome, and ignorance/want getting a little embellishment. But, I'm glad they kept the aging in there! It's an interesting part of the story to be sure.
The Ghost of Christmas Future was actually very creative and fresh. Other than the ridiculously long chase scene thrown in for no good reason, I enjoyed this part of the movie the most. Again, a bit creepy, but it's actually supposed to be. It was well done and eerie, without too many cheap ""jumps"".

All in all, it was alright. I'll stick to the George C. Scott version for a more serious and accurate tone, The Muppets for silly, Patrick Stewart for Patrick Stewart, and Albert Finney for the ""artistic liberties"" version of the Christmas Carol. All of those have heart and a good human element to them...something I found very much lacking in this one.",1388620800,16,3486,4.6375404530744335
4158835,5,B003NFM3JK,"My husband hates Jim Carrey, but he likes this cartoon.  Well done, seems true to the original in text, some of the action scenes added are annoying.",1388620800,,149,4.518518518518518
4158836,4,B003NFM3JK,I really enjoyed this adaptation of A Christmas Carol.  Top-tier voice talents and I felt like Jim Carrey nailed it as Scrooge without going over the top.  The only caution I would throw out there is that some of the scenes with the Ghost of Christmas Present may be a bit too scary for younger kids.  I'd definitely recommend parents check this out first before sharing an otherwise very good adaptation of a Christmas classic with the family.,1388620800,,444,4.666666666666667
4158837,5,B003NFM3JK,"I have been a long-time fan of the classic Dickens ghost story, A Christmas Carol and can say that after having seen this for the first time in 2012, it has become one of my favorites. ONE of my favorites, I must add - as all of the different versions have their own strengths and peculiar faithfulness to, or departures from, the original.

I have in my collection most of the theatrical versions of this story. Reginald Owen, Alistair Sim, George C. Scott, Patrick Stewart, and now the Disney version. Interestingly, I find (at least in my opinion) this version is one of the most faithful of all of the versions to the original Dickens novel as far as the dialog and scene-setting goes. Notwithstanding, the modest comedic license and the gratuitous ""in your face"" scenes that take advantage of the 3D capabilities of this release, the overall heart, dialog, and message of the original story come through with powerful and lasting impact.

I must admit, I have never been much a fan of Jim Carrey's work to date, but this movie says much to me about an actor who would take part in a project such as this and deliver an outstanding performance - visually, a digitally rendered work nonetheless, but his vocal performance is delivered with such feeling and power that makes one forget it is an animated telling of this classic story.

4158857,4,B003NFM3JK,"There are a number of sequences in this version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL that owe everything to Disney and naught to Dickens. These scenes occur most especially during the meeting with the Ghost of Christmas Future wherein Scrooge turns into the Incredible Shrinking Man for no apparent reason and thereby becomes, for all intents and purposes, nothing but a cartoon character. The way too-long chase by the ghostly coach and demonic horses is another excessive instance, reminiscent of Disney's Headless Horseman chasing Ichabod Crane. Another underwhelming because it is too overwhelming moment is where Scrooge rides the cone of the Ghost of Christmas Past like a rocket to the moon. These scenes come near to destroying the meaning and the message of Dickens' ""Ghost Story of Christmas."" Near - but thankfully not near enough.

Of course, the reason for these Disneyisms is clear: the makers of this version need to keep the attention of child viewers alert and action-happy. If I'd previewed these moments only I would have bet the entire movie was nothing but idiotic action.  Gladly it is NOT - and what remains is something quite fine and mostly faithful to its source material.

This is a very artistic film, rich in period detail, by turns intimate (such as the scenes spent with the Cratchit family) and panoramic (as in the flights through the streets of London and through Time and Space).  It is absolutely incredible how vocal and bodily performances by actual actors can be transmuted by the magic of computers into, well, a living cartoon without its actually being a cartoon.  The idea of motion capture goes back to Max Fleischer who patented the idea of the Rotoscope in order to simplify the process of animating movement by tracing frames of live action film. Fleischer utilized this process in the SUPERMAN cartoons of the early forties - and in the full-length cartoon of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS.  Technology has since then made a quantum leap with computerized motion capture - and the results are awesome and evocative.

This is an age of excess and over-the-topness in current films.  Like kids playing with new toys, many of our filmmakers don't know when to stop with the thrills of computer wizardry. This movie literally dies when it is trying too-hard to be most lively. Luckily, one can be an editor by way of fast forwarding through the inanities! Also luckily, the pluses of Disney's A CHRISTMAS CAROL outweigh the negatives.  This is a version of the classic tale that the entire family can enjoy.  The Ghosts are, yes, scary - but by keeping so much of the original dialog and main themes of the original novel this is a version that can be both entertaining and educational to anyone - children of all ages! - not familiar with Dickens' actual tale.  Recommended - if only to see Scrooge take the coins off the dead Marley's eyes lest they be sealed in the coffin and thereby wasted according to Scrooge's rapacious worldview.

Merry Day-after-Christmas - and God Bless Us, everyone!",1388016000,7,3012,4.895874263261296

There are a couple of 'additions' to help the flow, but it is a good film and does treat the book with respect.

I personally enjoyed it very much, especially the beautiful music, fantastic visual effects, and the fun ending. One of the Christmas movies which give a wonderful sense of a joyful, sincere conversion of heart.

But the huge downside of this movie is that it is not suitable for young children, and even many older children and adults may find certain scenes highly unpleasant. It has scenes which are very scary, dark, and gruesome. In one scene, probably the creepiest scene I have ever seen in a family movie, you watch a man dramatically age and turn into a skeleton over the course of about a minute while he is shouting and laughing maniacally.

I have no idea how on earth the creators thought these terrifying scenes would be loved by children. Who OK'd this?

One of the aspects I love about the movie is how close it stays to the book, but it exaggerates the scary parts. The book itself has some dark and scary parts, but the movie actually exaggerates and prolongs these, as well as adding some of its own. It would have been much better for it to tone these parts down considerably, make them more comical and less dark, and instead emphasize the happy parts, especially the ending.

There are a couple lines from the book which the movie changes to tone down religious elements (though the movie is filled with religious music and some religious imagery), and one line which is changed into an explicit critique of ""men of the cloth"". This is just another way the creators shot themselves in the foot here, because this line is sure to offend many religious people while attracting few others. Religious sentiment aside, I think it is a silly diversion which awkwardly distracts from the otherwise memorable scene.

This is a movie I will continue to personally enjoy myself, but I will never show it to children under about age 10.",1385596800,2,1952,4.679300291545189

On a flat screen, all the visual tricks used to enhance a 3D experience seem a bit contrived, but like the effects in The Polar Express, the story still takes center stage.  In some ways, Robert Zemeckis misses the point of this Christmas story and in an effort to make this film an ""experience"" for 3D theater viewers, especially children, he sacrifices story and character for cheap amusement park thrill ride.  In A Christmas Carol, the story still comes through and many elements of the original story appear that are often not included in other film versions of this story.

4158905,5,B003NFM3JK,"""...There'll be scary ghost stories. And tales of the glories of Christmases long, long ago.""

It seems a rather British tradition that Christmas time be accompanied by scary tales and ghost stories.  Some of that tradition has drifted over, and trickled down, to this side of the pond, here in the good ole US of A, and perhaps the most well-known incarnate manifestation of that tradition is in Charles Dicken's classic ""A Christmas Carol"" (the original title of which was ""A Christmas Carol. In Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas."") and its many adaptations on film and stage.  This particular adaptation of Robert Zemeckis' holds true to the scarier and darker aspects of the Dickensian story, probably more than any version I have ever seen.  Purists and fans of the book who appreciate British Christmas pastimes will probably love that part.  Idle American moviegoers thinking that it will be light, feel-good Disney fare will likely be a bit taken aback by it.

I might as well get this out of the way -- is it the best adaptation of the story?  In my opinion, no.  The 1951 version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Carol-2012-release/dp/B008UY8FI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Carol (2012 release)</a>&nbsp;starring Alastair Sim is the most moving and has the best character development.  You see so much more of Scrooge's backstory in that version -- more of his transition from being a warm, young idealist in love with a good woman to someone who fears the world too much and seeks emotional shelter in cold hard facts and becomes bent and hardened by them; the reasons of WHY he hated his nephew (Scrooge's sister, Fanny, died giving birth to Fred), why he often struggled with self-esteem and perhaps became reclusive (his father was unkind and didn't want him around, because he blamed Ebenezer for his mother's death, which of course wasn't his fault, just as Fanny's death wasn't Fred's fault),  -- and so we can empathize with Scrooge more; he becomes more human.  He becomes the best kind of villain, one in which we see our own darkness, fears, and shortcomings reflected in him.  This Disney version falls short of that beautiful backstory, and I struggled to give it five stars for these reasons (almost went with four), but it triumphs in other areas:

First, of all, it's a Zemeckis film, and that means a solid, glorious production from start to finish.  The wintry scenes are so realistic and beautiful.  There are so many themes of a classic Zemeckis flick -- flying, time travel, and of course, the amazing music composed by Alan Silvestri, which also includes some BEAUTIFUL, elegant, soaring arrangements of some traditional Christmas hymns.

Second, the three ghosts are marvelous, all played by Jim Carrey, which is to me a symbolic self-projection of Scrooge's past, present, and (tentative) future Christmases.  The Ghost of Christmas past, especially, is bar none, the most creative and artistic interpretation of that timeless, mysterious character.  If you have not seen it, I don't want to spoil it -- but the effect of that character for me, was reciprocal of the form and shape he takes -- ""luciferous"", in the best, most angelic sense possible.

The animation is superb. The 19th century London-era conditions and Christmas decorations are invitingly real.  Scrooge's harsh features and coldness of personalty are well-depicted, as are the youthful joys he later displays, post-redemption.  The animation is of course, more advanced than Zemeckis' earlier ""Polar Express"".

All in all, though not the best adaptation in my opinion, it's still a great movie, a great escape into Dickens and beautiful Christmas artistry.  For those who enjoyed the ghostly British traditions of this version, and would like to see something similar, I'd recommend the first episode of the second season of ""Lark Rise to Candleford""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Episode-1-HD/dp/B0042UIQYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Episode 1 [HD</a>].

4158906,2,B003NFM3JK,"I've seen five other versions of the Christmas Carol including: The Muppets, George C. Scott, Mickey's Christmas Carol, one with a London Humbug, and Mr. Magoo's version.

The reason for my rating on this one: 1 star for animation. 1 star for voice acting. -3 stars for the scary images.

I felt like I was walking through Transylvania at Christmas time. I've never been a fan of creepy things and this reminded me why.

Major Spoilers below:

It opens with Marley laying in his coffin. I felt that was a new way to do it, but I've got to admit, I hated it. The last thing I want to do is look at a dead man. I didn't mind Scrooge going through the streets and seeing how others avoided him. But once the ghost of Marley entered the scene, rolled his eyeballs around in his skull and flapped his ripped jaw, I was feeling freaked out. My first thought was: I'm never letting my kids see this movie!

When we get to the ghost of C. Past I was surprised to see a ghost that resembled a candle stick. When he spoke, he sounded like a hissing flame. I couldn't see his face very well (granted he was fire, but still I wanted to see more definition). I didn't like him.

C. Present started out well enough, I liked his throaty laugh. But his ""end"" was too much for me. I always preferred the fading out, shine, or sparkle effect to let the viewers know he was leaving. In this one he literally has a heart attack and DIES! He becomes a laughing skeleton! O_O!!! Then Ignorance and Want (the kids under the robes) spring up and turn into a knifing thug who's caged and then a prostitute who gets straight-jacketed and drug off screaming into the dark. If I'd been a kid, I would've ducked behind a couch!

C. Future. He was the one I expected to be scary and I definitely wasn't disappointed. But the carriage chase scene...not needed. I'm pretty sure they only stuck it in for the 3D thing they were doing at the theaters.

Overall, there wasn't enough of that warmth or happiness that you get in the other films when you watch the Crachetts, Nephew Fred, or the Fezzwigs celebrate their Christmases. I needed more of the family love and kindness, the joyful feel of celebration going on in order to care about them. Instead, I found myself very distanced in order to be mentally shielded from any another deteriorating ghost that might pop up in the movie. I couldn't even get a feel for Tiny-Tim. I felt for Bob when he went up the stairs, but that's about it.

There were three swears during the film, not needed.

When Scrooge came to himself, I was happy the film was nearly at it's end. When it was over, my mind was still reeling over the laughing skull of Christmas Present. I couldn't get that terrifying image out of my head.",1384732800,,2730,4.377470355731226
4158907,2,B003NFM3JK,"I've read the Christmas Carol many times and it is my favorite traditional Christmas movie.  For those who do not know, the story is about the redemption of a man so heartless that drastic measures have to be taken.

However, the measures taken in this movie are too drastic.  It should have been rated PG-13.  In short, they destroyed the wonderful beginning.  The film had promise, but it didn't keep that promise.  I wish I had Red-Boxed it first.

I give the talented voice-actors a solid 5.
The animation a solid 4 - because sometimes Scrooge looked wall-eyed or cross-eyed.
The script gets no stars and Disney a -6 for stamping their approval on a vastly inferior production.

Below are spoilers, but a few reasons I can't give this film a better rating.

Marley's lower jaw became unhitched during his famous rant and he had to manipulate it to speak.  Macabre and bizarre.  All previous versions of Marley had at least stirred some empathy from me, but not this one.  I liked his long chains and locked trunks better than him.

The ghost from Christmas past was a flame-headed alien with an unpleasantly sinister voice. If you read the book, you will find the ghost looked human - most of the time, not like a wandering candle.  This was never my favorite ghost, but at least the ghost showed more human qualities in the other productions.

The second is usually my favorite ghost.  What isn't to love?  He looks like and laughs like Father Christmas.  However, in this version, the ghost has a heart-attack, complete with gripping his chest and moaning in pain.  He turns chalk-white and dies in front of Scrooge - disintegrating into a laughing skeleton while the twins of ignorance and want become, respectively, a criminal and a screaming lunatic (literally).

The last ghost, the one that everyone should expect to be creepy, finally fits the bill and they did a great job with him.  BUT they added a long drawn-out chase scene involving red-eyed horses that chase an ever shrinking-in-size Scrooge who then speaks like someone that's been sucking helium.  Here, the film became a confusing collage of Sleepy Hollow and Darby O' Gill meet Scrooge!

At the end, where Scrooge is cavorting around, lightened of his decades-old burden of acknowledging the miracle he's been given, the cleaning woman freaks out and swears.  It wasn't needed and it wasn't funny.  There were no warm fuzzy feelings for me at the end.  I did not rejoice for Scrooge because it fell far short of my expectations.  I say save your money and time, don't bother with this one - watch the one with George C Scott as Scrooge.",1384732800,,2610,4.729490022172949
4158908,2,B003NFM3JK,"Even though the special effects were great, they changed the storyline too much - much more darker, and violent than any other Christmas Carol.",1384300800,,143,5.0
4158909,3,B003NFM3JK,"I have always enjoyed the story of A Christmas Carol, and I love (traditional hand drawn) animation. This obviously is computer animation and the animation is incredible. However, I was rather disappointed in this version of A Christmas Carol.  To me, it seemed to drag quite a bit to where I was losing interest. (VERY unusual for me!)  The Ghost of Christmas Past was a bit weird, in looks and in speech. I'm not quite sure what effect they were going for here but it did not work for me.  And I'm still trying to figure out why Scrooge was shrunk down to rodent size wtth the Ghost of Christmas past. (Maybe I missed something while I was losing interest as it dragged.)

I'm glad I didn't spend too much for the DVD. As much as I enjoy watching (repeatedly) the different versions of A Christmas Carol (and other Christmas movies), this is one I won't be watching over and over.

4158938,3,B003NFM3JK,"Amazon HD streaming was fantastic quality on PS3/projector.  The movie is a faithful rendition of the original story, but overall seems to lack a soul.  Many of the scenes looked simply made to wow the 3d-version viewers (can't watch 3d on Amazon streaming) and many of the more tender book moments felt plastic.  Some scenes would be quite frightening for young viewers, no doubt a strange experience for kids.  Not horrible, but far from stellar.",1372809600,4,448,4.933333333333334

It was perhaps a little too realistic as my 6 y/o ended up covering his eyes at several parts in the story. The ghosts are pretty frightening for little ones.

It is no wonder it costs $31.49.  And it seems to be that way across the board on most of the 3D movies worth watching.  Just give us the option to purchase what we want, a copy of the movies in Blu-Ray 3D format.  Now that the technology is up and running it doesn't cost any more to produce it in 3D than in 2D.  Enough of the BS!

The 2 Stars rating was because of all the BS.  The movie was excellant and on its own would have been given 4 Stars.  The sound affects especially were great.  The ticking sound made by the sleet impacting the roof tops was right on.",1357689600,,725,3.9722222222222223

If you've never seen a production of this classic tale...what the heck are you waiting for?!  It provides a VERY important lesson....one I wish the world would remember a little more often!

My personal favorite version, however, remains Bill Murray's turn in ""Scrooged"".  I'll admit I haven't seen it in awhile but if I'm remembering correctly, it's funnier.  This version (Jim Carrey) has some dark moments (I know, they all do especially when it comes to the Ghost of Christmas Future) so keep this in mind if you have younger viewers.  In fact, for the younger set, I recommend The Muppets Christmas Carol as a better introduction.  Older kids and tweens will probably prefer Disney's a Christmas Carol to the Muppet version however.

Please note...I did NOT view this in 3D...I'm sure the effects were cool though.",1357689600,,996,4.811764705882353

4159066,5,B003NFM3JK,"(A Note to parents:  This movie is rated PG for scary images.  The images are not gratuitous or 'above and beyond' the story line.  My 10 yr old watched it without any trouble.  You know your kid, I recommend previewing if you have any doubts, or check out the parent review on IMDb. They do a great job outlining movies specifically for parents.)
What do you get when you put Jim Carey, Gary Oldman and  Colin Firth in a Robert Zemechis  movie?  A great movie!  This classic story has been updated with  Zemechis' animation technique while staying true to the story.  There are some rather dark elements that I think Dickens himself would approve of.  Carey and Oldman deliver their multiple characters beautifully.  I find it ironic that Carey, who usually plays a character that makes us laugh (Mask) plays Scrooge and the 3 Ghosts, while Oldman, who usually plays the bad guy (Sirius Black, Sid Viscous, Dracula..to name a few of his brilliantly delivered bad guys..) plays Tiiny Tim, Bob Cratchet and Jacob Marley (we couldn't have all these crazy characters without giving Oldman one bad guy, could we?)  There are some scenes at are a bit darker that we are used to.  I think Zemechis had the courage to show the story as the dark story that it really is instead of trying to 'pretty it up' as has been done with previous versions.  My 10 year old son has watched it without any trouble.  If you have a child that is sensitive to dark images, you might want to preview it first...then decide.",1357430400,,1499,4.578947368421052

The only somewhat negative thing is, the DVDs doesn't let you re-size the picture to fill our 16:9 screen.  It's seems to be set in the ""theatrical size"" which won't allow adjustment to full letter-box size on some DVDs.

I'll look for one of the older offerings of A Christmas Carol, but then watch this one too.
The collection of recognizable actors and the quality of the digital animation attract me, but what knocks it out is the adherance to the original story and dialogue.

Some scenes may be too intense for small children but the message is good. Sadly, some of the effects do not transfer to tv as well as it was on the big screen but it won't notice it's missing if you didn't see at the theater.

I find it easy sometimes to get lost in the animation and forget the story which is why I give it 4 stars because even though it is amazing, it should not cause you to miss the story...but who can't help but stare mindlessly at the grotesque face of Scrooge or the chest hair of the ghost of Christmas present.

4159127,4,B003NFM3JK,"Disney's 2009 version of ""A Christmas Carol"" brings Charles Dickens' classic to vivid life with the dramatic animation over live acting that made ""Polar Express"" such an entrancing visual experience.  In the case of ""A Christmas Carol"", the effects are quite moving.  Londontown never looked so forbiding in the dark, nor so cheerful on Christmas morning.  The ghosts look as scary as they were meant to be; after all, ""A Christmas Carol"" is about motivating a stubborn old miser into better behavior.  The movie effectively captures all the essential elements of the story, including the presentations by the ghosts of past, present, and future.  If some scenes are a bit over the top, such as the exotic dancing at Old Fezziwig's, or Ebenezer's flying sequences, it's a bit of relief after Scrooge's unhappy confrontations with the ghosts.  Jiim Carrey does a terrific job behind the animation as Scrooge.  Highly recommended, as long as you like this particular style of animation.",1356393600,,984,5.1125

One scene in this movie that is missing from all the other versions is the scene of the ghosts flying through the air, and the changing face of the Ghost of Christmas Present. Although Jim Carrey has been known to over-act, he treated this work very seriously. He plays many parts, which is not apparent at all. The Ghost of Christmas Present is rich in detail and color; the way he and Scrooge peer into the present is closely follows the book. Many civic virtues are demonstrated in this work.

I'm almost 26, and this movie scared me to death.  I remember thinking, ""Ok, if I keep watching this, it'll get better"".  I was wrong, it only got worse.  When Jacob Marley's jaw broke I was shocked and horrified.  But that wasn't even the worst part.  The scariest part was when the ghost of christmas present was dying and decomposed into a skeleton with eyeballs in its skull, who was laughing hysterically.  This is NOT a kid's movie!!  If this scared me, an adult, I can only imagine how much it would scare a child.  I've had a hard time sleeping ever since watching this movie.  I have only one more thing to say to anyone brave enough to watch this movie.

The character animation is astounding. Its alive and detailed. The voice acting is top notch. Because the medium is computer generated they were able to add scenes from the book that are just not possible to include in any real acted version. It is as close to the book as you can get. I know some people see these CG movies and think they are for kids but you would be missing out if you skipped this over that thinking.

True, the scene animation and voice characterizations are stellar.  But make no mistake, this is a HORROR MOVIE packaged as a PG children's movie.  Disney doesn't care one bit about all those children aged 2, 3, 4, 5, 6? etc who were dragged into the theater by their unwitting parent and exposed to some of the most horrific and startling images imaginable.  Why is Hollywood so hell-bent on hastening our children's transition from innocence to trauma-survivor??!!!  I can say that with some credibility as I am a therapist with trauma survivors...and there is such a thing as cumulative trauma.

Many people have said it is too dark for children, I agree, even my teenager looked at me at one point, and said ""This is wacked, can I go?"" It just wasn't Muppets Christmas Carol - our forever Christmas Eve family tradition. She was disturbed. It was startling, actually, how gruesome it got. Spoiler alert - Ghost of Christmas present dies of what appears to be a massive heart attack, and then devolves into a skeleton that blows away like ash. The children in the folds of his coat reminded me of the apocalyptic stragglers from the Will Smith film, I Am Legend. It was in deed, really wacked. There is a carriage chase a little reminiscent of the Ghost of Sleepy Hollow, something not in the book, I think, and the end of that scene was very frightening. It really was too bad, would that the director has been as restrained as Carey - sometimes enough is just perfect.

4159209,5,B003NFM3JK,And it really is a ghost story that isn't for children at all. It is a little surprising that the first big budget animated version of this story is also the scariest version ever filmed. Putting the Disney name before the title probably misled some into thinking this version was made especially for kids. I love the whole film but the part with the ghost of Christmas past is pure magic. If the scene with the shrunken Scrooge being chased through the streets by the black carriage seems out of place it's because it's not in the original story. Also the ghost of Christmas present dissolving into a skeleton is another new addition to the original. These things add thrills but they're not Dickens.,1352678400,,701,4.661290322580645
4159210,5,B003NFM3JK,"I'm a big fan of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. The story has become culturally iconic around the world.
It continues to resonate in our minds, since its original publication in the mid-1800's.
This production is, far-and-away, the very finest production of this classic story that has ever been produced,
and I have seen all of them.

The animation is so life-like... so very, very real ... so detailed.  Particularly because the storyline contains imagery
of ghosts sweeping Scrooge away on supernatural trips back and forth through time... it took the power of modern
animation to bring that to life.  This production offers us that which this story has always cried out for... such other-worldly
fantastic imagery... but not in a cartoonish way, rather, in a shockingly lifelike way unique to 21st Century high-end animation.

I was also pleased to see that so many of the best lines from the book are faithfully used in this production, and Disney did
not abuse its artistic license.  Disney (amazingly) also did not attempt to secularize or ""de-Christianize"" the message
at all. It packs the strong message of accountability and charitable responsibility, and does not shy away from that
Christ-centered message, or make it more ""politically correct"" in any way.

Visually, it is just spectacular. The animation is breathtaking in its detail (especially the BluRay version).
There are not many movies that I would watch over and over again. This is one of them.
If I could only have a half-dozen movies in my collection... this would be one of them.",1352419200,2,1562,5.011583011583012
4159211,5,B003NFM3JK,"The movie is excellent, it has a very good message. Some scenes can be frightening for kids but they are part of the story, I mean, those scenes appear in the book too. Anyway, I do not recommend it to very young kids.",1352246400,,218,4.093023255813954
4159212,5,B003NFM3JK,"I will never forget watching this movie for the first time in 3D at the theater. My eyes roved about the screen, trying to take in every minute detail - which was near to impossible. Some effects made me gasp and others made my jaw drop. Robert Zemeckis is one of my favorite film-makers simply due to his unique camera angles and approaches to scene setup. This movie satisfied me in every way. I left the theater with my mind whirring, still blown away by the entertainment. The thing I like most about Zemeckis' version is how he chose (unlike many other film-makers who have adapted Dickens' classic tale for the movie screen) to focus on the fact that the story really is, first and foremost, a haunting! Zemeckis' take on Dickens' story leaves viewers with less doubt of that fact than there should be doubt that Marley was as dead as a doornail!",1352160000,,852,4.538961038961039
4159213,4,B003NFM3JK,"To fully enjoy a movie the picture and sound are critical. This is especially true for Disney's, A Christmas Carol. I first saw this on IMAX in 3D and was very impressed. I later watched it on Netflix and enjoyed it, but the experience was not quite the same. While the story, animation, and voice acting were very good, much of the emotional impact of the story was lost at home without the engrossing effects of a six story three dimensional image and 10,000 watts of sound.

However, I recently purchased a 3D TV and decided to pick up this 3D blu-ray. After watching it with the surround cranked and the glasses on I found the experience to be close to that of the theater. One drawback was that the aspect ratio was set at 2.40:1, which is the standard for widescreen cinema. As a result, the ""black bars"" were present at the top and bottom of my tv. Normally I wouldn't mind this, but the IMAX screen ratio is 1.43:1, and so to fit the full IMAX image into a 16:9 tv the black bars should have been present on the sides of the screen. As a result, there were times where I felt that I wasn't seeing everything that I should have been, similar to watching a widescreen film that has been cropped to fit a 4:3 TV. I'm not sure what the film's optimum aspect ratio was intended to be, but I'm inclined to think that 2.40:1 is not it.

There are some original interpretations of the story and dialogue, and after reading some of A Christmas Carol, it seems to stay pretty true to the book. The chase scenes did get a little tiresome. I found myself wondering how much more screaming I could listen to, or how Jim Carrey managed to carry on like that in the studio. I think George C. Scott was a better Scrooge and other renditions took on a creepier interpretation that I thought worked better for the story, but this is a Disney film created in part for children, making it all the more appropriate.

Overall I'm very happy with this purchase, especially on blu-ray 3D. The story is timeless, the voice acting is very good, the music is phenomenal, and the 3D effects are awesome. I think that the 3D is critical to fully enjoy this movie, as it doesn't quite hold up on the animation, voice-acting, and action alone. If the image filled the TV or was set at an IMAX ratio I would be inclined to give this 5/5.",1351987200,,2313,4.349537037037037

4159215,5,B003NFM3JK,"In the Victorian era of the United Kingdom, the stingy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) that hates Christmas and people loses his partner Jacob Marley in a Christmas Eve. For seven years, he runs his business exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) and spends a bitter treatment to his nephew and acquaintances. However, in the Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed ghost of the chained Marley that tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of past Christmas, recalls his miserable youth; the spirit of the present Christmas shows him the poor situation of Bob's family; and the spirit of future Christmas shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and God bless us everyone, changing his behavior toward Christmas, Bob, his nephew and people in general.

This dark adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens to the screen is one of those optimistic films that follows the style of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and it is impossible not loving it. The redemption of the mean Ebenezer Scrooge in a Christmas Eve is one of the most known worldwide novels and this animation produced by Disney Company follows the style of Tim Burton and may not be the best adaptation to the cinema, but it is indeed effective and a good family entertainment.

4159223,5,B003NFM3JK,"I will start by saying that as a child, I performed in the live performance of ""A Christmas Carol"" in the local public theatre of my hometown for several years. In doing so, I saw the play many, many times.  This was the first movie adaptation of A Christmas Carol that I have even seen that evoked the deep, visceral feelings that I experienced as a child performing in the story.  The delivery of the lines, the almost imperceptible nuances of behavior at times, the atmosphere that came with each ghost... I haven't seen those in any of the other CC movies to date. This was the only one that I felt truly captured a live feeling, like I was immersed in the story instead of just watching it. In addition, the CGI allowed the ghost experience to go beyond what is physically possible in the constraints of the stage and turn into a true supernatural experience. I especially liked the ever-accelerating aging of the Ghost of Christmas Present. He only has one day to live in the novel as well, and this version really showed it well. The gritty yet romantic feeling of industrial, Victorian England was impeccably captured as well and and truly made me feel like I was there. The ONLY thing I didn't care for was the long chase scene. It wasn't true to the novel and went on for too long. But I usually just fast-forward through that anyway! What a great adaptation; I will be watching this for years to come!",1339372800,,1412,4.490272373540856
4159224,4,B003NFM3JK,"I read A Christmas Carol when I was a kid. It was an abridged version, if I recall. So I am familiar with the story, not the book. I was watching the special features on this movie, and they were talking about how this book, even though it was written so long ago, really lends itself well to the animation process, because there are so many things actors can't physically do. And, this is the most faithful adaptation ever. Of course, if you watch the special features on any movie, even one that got horrible reviews, you will hear the actors and backstage people brag about how well they interpreted everything, what a fine cast they had, how perfectly it all came about, etc.

Well, I did enjoy the movie. I enjoyed the animation. I can't really say how faithful it was to the book because I read it too long ago. But the basic story seemed to be there. Scrooge's change from penny-pinching to generous seemed a little abrupt to me. It seemed more from fear than learning. I can agree that they did things that were physically impossible and needed animation for. But then I wonder... why did they use motion capture? They had to set up all those weird contraptions to move around the actors, and then animate most of it anyway. Doesn't that just make it all a lot harder? Like doing it twice? They said (bragged) in the special features that using all the dots on the actors' faces allowed them to capture all the nuances of the actors' expressions. But then, animators on regular computer-animated movies are pretty proud of the expressions they come up with for their characters, too. I don't really get it. Their characters didn't look any more expressive then characters in movies like Shrek. I think they just made more work for themselves. But what the heck. The actors said it was a lot of fun.

Well anyway, I enjoyed WATCHING the movie. I didn't get to see the 3-D version. I'm not a Christmas Carol aficionado with tons of things to compare it to. And I didn't have any little kids to scare. So it was a fun diversion.",1337212800,,2033,4.491891891891892

So, I rented it and was amazed.  The graphics were exceptional.  Everything was immensely beautiful.  Even more than that though, the thing I was the most pleased with was how they chose to stay faithful to the original story by Dickens.  They chose to respect his work, so I am so much the more inclined to respect them for it.  Good job all around.

The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five was for the few times they chose to abandon Dickens' story line.  There was one scene in particular where Scrooge asks the ghost of Christmas present why he chose to have all of the stores in town close down one day a week.  I assume he is referring to the Sabbath.  The ghost of Christmas present then rebukes organized religion by telling Scrooge to not blame him for the mistakes made by ""so called men of the cloth who claim to know me.""

4159244,1,B003NFM3JK,"This caricature of Charles Dickens' wonderful Christmas story was not only a complete disappointment, it was a pointless attempt at humor.  Beginning with completely skipping over Ebenezer Scrooge's walk home from his office on Christmas Eve when the first hint of something unusual happening (the ghost horses and hearse)became evident, to the Ghost of Christmas Past portrayed as a disembodied head with its skull on fire, hovering over the ghostly shoulders of a weird little body, and on to an almost total bastardization of a Christmas classic, the kindest thing I can think of to say about this film is, ""Shame on Disney.""

I was aware before I bought this DVD, of course, that the characters were not real people, but rather computer graphics, but that seemed like it might be kind of a fun film.  I have the movie ""The Polar Express,"" and there are no ""real people"" in that either, and most of the Polar Express voices belong to Tom Hanks, and that's a most enjoyable film.  But as it turns out here, Jim Carrey as the voice of Scrooge, minus that fantastic talent for visual comedy, was a real loss of what I thought was good potential for an enjoyable version of A Christmas Carol.

I agree with the statement of a couple other reviewers that there are a few questionable scenes in what would most likely be considered a children's movie since it was made by Disney, scenes that might be frightening to young children.  Having viewed this movie, if I had young children, I'd be very reluctant to allow them to watch this one.

For a delightful presentation of a different spin on the Christmas Carol movie, the musical version ""Scrooge"" is the best so far.",1325116800,4,1666,4.70446735395189
4159245,2,B003NFM3JK,"Based upon past reviews I was expecting a wonderful story and excellent 3-D effects.  This movie fails in both departments.  What I was most stunned with, in a negative way, was the corruption of Dickens' story.  How dare screenwriter and director Robert Zemeckis give but a passing glance to Tiny Tim's predicament, Scrooge's lost love, and the joy Scrooge used to have in his heart as a young man.  If the viewer had never seen any past presentations of this story I doubt they could have easily followed, what should have been, clear, emotion filled moral points. Instead, the lack of emotion generating scenes made this a cold, get it done and over with feeling the director must have had in his heart about this entire project.  The difference in volume between the soft spoken scenes and the loud special audio effects was too vast.  It was as though the dialog wasn't considered as important as the crashing and banging.  Also, the needlessly overt visual darkness of most of the movie seemed to be a cheap after thought that was used to try to add an ominous feeling since the directing and script and acting didn't do it.  Speaking of visuals, the 3-D rendering was a complete disappointment.  At best there were a few 5% out of screen moments.  Compared to other 3-D movies this was woefully lacking.  Add to that many out of focus shots and the 3-D version fell flat on it's face.  By no means ever use this movie to showcase your 3-D system to your friends.  They would leave smiling inside at their wise purchase of just a normal television.

4159248,4,B003NFM3JK,"With income-disparity at a level not seen since the turn of the last century, Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" has never seemed more timely and relevant in its spirit and message.  No longer just a quaint little tale from a distant past, the story, with its themes of unbridled greed and compassion for the poor, speaks with a renewed urgency to our current generation.

So, polemics aside, how does the 2009 ""motion-capture"" animated version of this most famous of all stories stack up against the umpteen others we've seen over the course of a lifetime (including those featuring The Muppets and Mr Magoo)?  Very well, actually.  Robert Zemechis' movie remains generally faithful to the source material, and, while it provides us with a visually ravishing - almost snow globe-like - look at a wintry 19th Century London, it isn't afraid to confront the darker elements of the tale as well (as such, it might be a bit frightening for very young kids at times).  And while one could accuse it of going a trifle overboard in its search for the requisite 3-D sensation (as most of these films by their very nature are won't to do), the movie remains forever focused on the human heart that beats at the core of the work.

Even in semi-animated form, Jim Carrey is so remarkable as the miser Scrooge (and the three main ghosts who visit him) that, in the spirit of the holidays, we're even willing to forgive him for his desecration of the Grinch a decade or so back.  And he's backed by a first-class cast that includes Robin Wright Penn, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Bob Hoskins, and Cary Elwes among others.

Therefore it teaches children to fear the unknown and slaves them to live in fear and hence weakens their full potential in life.
  The story is best suited for medieval times, when people believe in ghosts and witchery. If I should rated this movie for the special effects it would probably get a 4.5 to 5 stars. But the content in it self brings depression to people who still believes in hell and feels far short from the natural love of God. I will suggest to any one that is suffering from depression or any similar situation to avoid this movie at all cost, even if the outcome is somehow positive at the end. Shame on Disney that continues to scare young children, with a nonsense, never ending of evil versus good. Of course there are always those who love a good terror movie or a book that immerses them into a hell of fear. For them this movie is a full 5 stars.",1323648000,2,1053,4.313131313131313

I don't recall Ebenezer surfing a rooftop on an icicle or rocketing into the stratosphere after snuffing out Christmas past in the Dickens classic.

This is a prime example of a movie made solely to showcase 3D. Zemeckis has proven with Polar Express that he can make a great movie where the special effects are embellishments to a good story line. Not here. Lest you forget, nearly every scene is designed around showing off just how cool 3D can be, whether it's Marley spitting or an insect sized Scrooge rocketing down a drain pipe (I'm sorry, what page is that on in the book?)

4159258,5,B003NFM3JK,"I know that my title is suggesting a lot, but let me explain. I've had this battle about which Christmas Carol is the best adaptation of the book with many friends and most of the time, I get that the George C Scott version,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Carol/dp/B0006419KA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Carol</a>&nbsp;is the best. So I watched it and to be honest, it was a great version, but I think it had many faults. However I won't get into that here since this review is for the Disney version. Let's get to it.

THE STORY
I saw a review here stating that this movie moved too slow through the emotional scenes and too quickly through everything else. Your opinion on this may differ depending on how you interpret the book, but for me, this story is a heartfelt tale of a grumpy old man who hates happiness mainly because he doesn't have any. You're supposed to hate this man while trying to figure out why everyone around him has sympathy. Only later on when Scrooge is visited by his spirits do you begin to understand how he got to be the way he is. And right about the moment you start feeling your own sympathies, you watch Scrooge begin to ""open his eyes"". After the spirits have shown him his past, present and future, Scrooge has an awakening and realizes what's really important in life. The reason I mentioned all that is because although this book was written during part of Charles Dickens' darkside of storytelling and ""A Christmas Carol"" was (or is) supposed to be a ghost story, I feel like with today's audience, this story won't scare anyone, so it's nice to have a bit of the warm side.

Other adaptations of this story do not have much of a warm side, but the Disney version seems to capture both. The speed of this film is perfect. If you watch the other versions with the book in hand, it almost feels like the actors are simply reading their lines and jumping from one scene to the next with no time for the audience to take in what is transpiring. That's why I do not think this version moves too slow.

Unlike the George C. Scott version, I find that with Disney's version, Scrooge makes a more believable transformation in the end. Because he starts out as a feeble old man, it becomes very believable that he's only being mean because he has an unhappy side to him. This is why the people around him feel so much sympathy. It's almost like it's not his fault. To me, this makes the best Scrooge. The problem with George C. Scott is that he's already a very powerful and dominating force (and great actor), so he's already expected to be a mean person. This makes it feel like at the end of that movie, Scrooge is more or less just being nice because he has to and not because he really had a life-changing night. There's not much of a distinction between angry George C. Scott and happy George C. Scott!

Disney's version makes Scrooge very humble in the end...almost to the point of groveling (although he doesn't). The reason this sold it for me was because it made me feel like the spirits really shook him to his core. He was genuinely scared and sad throughout the whole process, thus the end reactions appear more genuine. The end scene at his nephew's house even has a bit of sadness to it. It's hard to get choked up over animated movies, but this one comes very close! I think that if this movie had been live-action, Jim Carrey might not have sold me on Scrooge only because it's hard to see Jim Carrey as a mean person. However, the way he voiced Scrooge really brings it home.

THE SPIRITS
A lot of reviews hated the spirits in this version for either being too weird, too obnoxious or too scary. I find all three of these assessments to be false. In almost every adaptation, the Spirit of Christmas Present is generally the same, but the other two vary dramatically. I found that what Disney did with the Spirit of Christmas Past (making him a candle) fit in best with how Dickens described him in the book. It made it much easier to visualize a spirit with a head glowing of bright light (the flame) and it made more sense as to why he was holding a snuffer. Granted, the comparison might be unfair to past iterations because this movie employs special effects that we didn't have in the past, but still...I think it's much better.

The one thing I liked a lot was that the first two spirits were acted out by Jim Carrey too. When reading the book, you almost want to believe that the spirits are actually figments of Scrooge's own imagination, therefore they would probably be in his own image. In this movie, they are just that and they make no attempt at hiding this fact. That in itself offered a little more to the ""coolness"" factor.

The Spirit of Christmas Future is what really makes this movie seem scary, but that's where we get into the realm of the original story being a ghost story. I really like that Disney didn't ""Disney-fy"" it too much. Of course, there is some concern with this film being too scary for young children as it deals with death and is generally a very dark picture, but keeping it inline with the story was very important and this version does just that. If you're concerned about your children, just watch it with them and explain to them what's going on. They'll understand.

THE SOUND
One of the areas where this movie excels is the sound and music. If you have the option, watch this on your home theatre system and you'll be mesmerized by how the littlest of sound will be so prevalent in very quiet scenes. I find that this adds to the drama and even creates a bit of fear in some parts. Even the voices are crisp and clear. The sound of falling snow sounds just as it would. It almost let's you hear what cold sounds like...if that's possible!

The soundtrack is just as fabulous although this film is not heavily scored. I find that it uses music in just the right places and by doing so, it doesn't drown out what's happening.

CONCLUSION
I find something I like in all versions of A Christmas Carol and I've seen a lot! However, I really loved the book and it always makes me wonder off to some cold city in England of the past where Christmas is a vibrant time during the coldest part of the year. I wonder how life would have been back in those times and I try to imagine what it would be like to live in a place like that. Unfortunately, many of the film adaptations still feel like we're on a movie set and things don't always look right. This version, however really illustrates an almost perfect collection of scenes that seem to flow seamlessly from one to the next. Of course, the fact that this movie is animated helps out a lot since they can do whatever they want with a virtual world, but that's ok! If that's the best way to tell a story like this, then so be it.

None of what I said above is meant to disregard any other version of this story as they are all great in their own way. But in the end, this has become my favorite.",1323302400,3,7000,4.4609375

4159263,5,B003NFM3JK,"First off I must say that I am generally NOT a Jim Carrey fan.  I find his humor to be crass and most of his movies are not funny to me except for a few.  However, I find this to be an excellent movie and Jim Carrey's flexibility in acting are great in this movie.  He plays a wide variety of characters, from Ebenezer Scrooge to the Ghost of Christmas Past, and the Ghost of Christmas Present, and a few more.  I was impressed with his voice overs.  The animation is outstanding and I enjoy the ""special effects"" which compliment this classic story by Charles Dickens.  I remember when it first came out in theatres.  I decided not to see it because as I have stated, I am generally not a Jim Carrey fan.  I saw it on DVD last Christmas season and was quite pleasantly suprized.
For those of you who are not a Jim Carrey fan, I must say that you should see this movie if you chose not to watch any of his other movies.  This one is NOT a disappointment or insulting in anyway.

The skin textures of the close-up shots!  The eyes capture the emotions of the characters - particularly in one scene when Cratchit and Scrooge are face-to-face on the stairway of Cratchit's home.  I loved the portrayal of the Grim Reaper as only a morphing shadow.  Wonderful creativity while staying true to the Dickens tale.  Carry does an excellent job not over-acting this part.

4159266,2,B003NFM3JK,"Watched this with the family tonight and it was nearly a complete flop. We rarely watch PG with our little ones but they had seen older versions of A Christmas Carol and were familiar with the story - this one is pumped full of adrenaline and creepiness. Really? Why? The tale is much better told for meaning than for thrills. I guess maybe those bases were covered with the earlier, and in my opinion much better, versions of the tale adapted to film.

That said the voice acting was good and I am fond of the actors involved (in general). The CGI was ... well creepy but good (in a Polar Express way). The story stayed pretty much true to Dickens' work - but it diluted it with 3D moments and action. Perhaps this speaks to the tween/teen market better than traditional dramatizations but it just wasn't really for us.

With at least four very good live action versions in circulation we won't need to view this 'amped up' version again.

4159270,2,B003NFM3JK,I found this way to scary for kids. I think this should be rated PG-13. I would never watch this movie with a child. Why did Disney make such a creepy cartoon?,1321056000,2,159,4.0
4159271,3,B003NFM3JK,"This film has been completely rendered in CGI.  As such it has some advantages over, and yet alternatively suffers when compared to, the best live action dramas.  In addition, this production cannot seem to decide whether it is to be a dark yet faithful adaptation of Dickens' work, or a pratfall-strewn, cartoon comedy.  With feet in both camps, it ends up unsuccessful in each.  There can be no question that CGI can offer a lot to enhance such a costume drama.  Every inanimate object was rendered faithfully and sometimes astonishingly.  The city of London in the 19th century was wonderfully presented.  The filming of Spirits and other spectral events can be greatly enhanced by CGI effects.  But ultimately it is the characters that sell the story.  The animated people in this production looked waxy and unrealistic.  Facial expressions lacked the sublime subtlety of reality.  Eyes were glassy and expressionless resembling audio-animatronic figures more than real human beings.  Things were not helped by the screenwriters' inability to come to grips with how they wanted to tell the story.  The pratfalls and comic chases clashed alarmingly with the dark and creepy aspects of the rest of the story.  Much of the film was a straight telling of Dickens' tale and was obviously well-researched as many details provided in the novella were accurately rendered.  Yet in its schizophrenia, the film also chooses at times to dispense with any effort at accuracy or even verisimilitude by inserting ridiculous scenes of cartoon-like quality.  If one wants a satisfying cartoon version of the Dickens tale, both amusing and touching, one need only view Disney's ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"".  In short, while at times quite accurate, its deficiencies make it difficult to recommend this film as the most accurate filmic representation of Dickens.

4159273,5,B003NFM3JK,"First, just because the Disney name is attached, do not think for a moment that this is a movie suitable for young children.  It is not.  Who it is suitable for is fully grown adults.  The visual effects are absolutely stunning, and the story is very faithful to the actual Dickens book.  Frankly, it can be quite disturbing to young viewers.  But it can also be disturbing to adult viewers in a way that Dickens himself would most likely have approved.  In fact, I think it relays the message he intended to relay: Fear death now while ye yet live and can make changes.

I knew from the moment that Jacob Marley made his deathly appearance, wrapped in chains that he forged in life, that this was going to be a moving experience.

Scrooge: ""What do you want with me?""

Marley (dragging his chains): ""Ooooh, much! ... Aaaaaahg!""

Throughout his conversation with Scrooge, he is preoccupied with looking at the chains he is bound with.  ""I wear the chains I forged in life.  I made it link by link and yard by yard.  Can you recognize it's pattern?  Can you imagine the lengths and weight of the chain you bear?  Yours is a ponderous chain"".

The ghost of Christmas past is ghostly, and his voice is like the flickering of the candle he is represented as.  The Ghost of Christmas Present dies as though by heart attack while a giant bell tolls.  And the Ghost of Christmas yet to Come is, frankly, frightening - even to an adult.  He appears as nothing more than something like a three dimensional shadow.  The kind of thing that makes me wish I had seen this one, at least, in 3D on the big screen.

The story is fantastically faithful to the original text as penned by Dickens.  The dialogue is fantastic, even by today's standards: ""Would you so soon put out, with your worldly hands, the light that I give?""

4159284,4,B003NFM3JK,"There are certain things about this animated  Disney version of ""The Christmas Carol"" that are unique and amazing.  However, there are other things that are mundane and quite lacking in creativity.  When Charles Dickens wrote this beloved tale it was told in a simple manner with a good life's lesson to be learned.  However, the lack of concentration on the Bob Crachit family was appalling.  One of the most important aspects of the Dicken's tale (besides the revival of a GOOD Ebenezer Scrooge) was the strength of this little family as they stood up to poverty with grace and dignity. Yes, there are scenes with the little family gathering about the  Christmas table, but they were  too short.  You never really get to know or understand who and what they were.  Once Ebenezer has a change of heart you don't experience the joy that such a dramatic change should bring.  It simply fell flat. Scenes with  the Ghost of Christmas Past were bright and creative and beautifully done.  Seeing young Ebenezer before he became the miser frankly fell flat.  However, it was delightful seeing his old employer and his wife as they exploded with Christmas cheer.  I felt as if the makers of this film rushed the story and the viewer was left wanting the missing pieces of a puzzle. The film is colorful and the art work is very good, but  I felt that it was only half a story being told, and wondered where the rest of the tale might be.  One does not experience the sudden wonder when the change takes place in Scrooge and you miss that.  I ""liked"" the film, but I did not love it.",1317513600,,1576,4.551601423487544

4159286,5,B003NFM3JK,"Jim Carrey stars as Scrooge and also plays the roles of the spirits - past, present and future.  Rather than his usual, silly style of acting, and what I refer to as ""overacting,"" he does a serious, Oscar-worthy job here. The film was created using stop-motion animation, similar to ""The Polar Express.""  It is like combining reality with fantasy resulting in mesmerizing characters. It must have taken a really long time to make this movie. I cannot even imagine what that process is like!

What I love about this version of A Christmas Carol is that it is quite true to Charles Dickens' original story.  Carrey portrays the misery and unparalleled nastiness of Ebeneezer Scrooge perfectly. That combined with the magic of 3D makes for a most extraordinary movie-going experience. For a Miami girl like me, it was a true pleasure being snowed upon! This animation makes you feel as if you are Scrooge himself, flying with the ghosts, running from fear and being overcome with regret. There are many creepy scenes, and for that reason I say this movie may be too scary for very young children.

The only thing I was not crazy about was a scene where Scrooge is frantically running through the streets, being chased by a dark carriage. The story line here seems to go on and on, and just when you feel relieved that it is over, the creepy carriage reappears a few more times. It did not make a lot of sense to me.

After watching this movie, I asked myself, ""What is it about these classic, overly familiar stories that keep us coming back for more?"" I think the answer is that we love what we know, yet we want to experience familiarity in original ways. Does that make any sense to you? The fact that Scrooge, a totally unlikeable, unfeeling human can face his own cruelty, be filled with regret and then change, gives us all hope for ourselves and others.

What if you came face-to face with the spirits of your past, present and future? What would you see? What would you want to change?",1317168000,,1990,4.588732394366197

While this was a different interpretation of the story, I felt that Zemeckis fell a little too in love with the technology and lost focus on what matters--the story.  With a lot of swooping camera shots and a head-scratching action sequence involving a miniaturized Scrooge, this was turned into empty spectacle, not to mention I found it a little creepy seeing Gary Oldman's face on Bob Cratchit's body.  As for the story itself, I found Scrooge's transformation forced, a product more because the makers wanting it to happen rather than arising naturally from the character.

While this version may appeal to children or anyone who hasn't seen one of the umpteen other versions of this story, it probably won't work for those us who have seen it before.

4159296,4,B003NFM3JK,"Another Christmas, and Hollywood has another remake of the Dickens' classic ready to go.  This time we have Jim Carrey playing Scrooge.  Though this might seem crazy at first, as Carrey is a comedian and this story is a drama, remember that Carrey carried the the live-action adaptation of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas.  And he does it again with this movie, which I think is the best adaptation of A Christmas Carol.  All the previous CGI-flicks directed by Robert Zemeckis has finally led to this impressive work.  The music is good, the animation is spot-on, the dialog is perfect, and the action is engaging.  The special effects are probably the movie's  highlight, but they serve the movie, allowing the film's story to be told in new ways, and do not distract from either the plot or the dialog.  And like Tom Hanks in Polar Express, Jim Carrey plays multiple characters in this movie, including the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future.  It is his acting in these scenes that show him at his best.  The movie's representation of the ghost of Christmas present was the best one I've ever seen, with an innovative way of having the ghost take Scrooge around London to show how his peers are talking about him.  Overall, probably the best Christmas movie of the year.",1305849600,,1282,4.72972972972973

I took a look at the 3d disc and the outer edge of the disc looked like the metal they write the data to was crinkled like tin foil. Amazon gave us an exchange, but lesson learned, rush to watch bluray movies you buy, as they don't seem to have good quality control. The exchange wounded up coming with a damaged case and the same crinkled ring on the 2d disc. I ended up putting together the best of the 2 copies and sent back the dilapidated mess. I should knock it more stars for the quality of the disc, but I feel it's isolated. The movie is good, a much more truthful version of the classic book. I loved it esp. all the old creaky english accents and grey palor over the whole scenery.

My overall extreme limit conclusions of this fim to others are that the makers of this suggestive
allegorial dance of death in this macabre film are as if they were on a binge of Cocaine, Heroin,
Cannabis and/or were drunk when they created such non-realistic monstrosity as this is not for
general viewings but ONLY for sick morbid voyeurs. Those involved into the indiscriminate killing
(mascaring) of the great ""Charles Dickens' Novel"" who the man himself would had came out of his grave if
he did saw that film.  At least they had some commonsense into hiding some sequences by not letting them have the real 3D Effects thus making them less gruesome.  No wonder the world is going to the dogs (so to speak) whilst the film industries, the media tabloids  and law-makers are glorifying all the lunatics on illicite drugs, booze; and criminals who are infact just law-breakers (that many of those so-called actors & actresses who were caught on drugs, booze etc and still are being glorified , we the filmgoers had lost count).Apart from this film's illogical mentalities and ill-conceived film-making perceptions; some sequences
had great & fantastics 3D Effects which would be a delight for 3D moviegoers.
I without doubt do give this movie a ""2 out of 5 Star"" rating after taking in considerations of this great
great work of Charles Dickens Novel and the few Real 3D Effects.

I was amazed and maybe even a little disappointed that I would not be able to share this movie with my grand children. That being said it definitely not a children's movie but it was a wonderful mature version of a classic. While another review , who claims to be a "" Christmas Story "" aficionado really cuts the movie as a one star movie. They themselves even admit that the dialog is inline with the writing in the book. But I myself loved the visual adaptation and enjoyed the introduction of new visual aspects of the movie. I did not see the 3d version of the movie, I'm not really into the 3d yet, but I can see how a lot of what was added to the movie would have been awesome in 3d. All that said I thought Jim Carrey was amazing in portraying all the different characters that he did. And if you take the time to view the extras on the DVD you may actually come to appreciate more just how  Robert Zemeckis (Director) did an amazing adaptation of this story.

I applaud Disney for staying true to the story & not being afraid to include the references to God (and in one instance, specifically to Jesus - the One Who makes the lame walk,  paraphrase). The animation is stellar, the voicing is fantastic, and the orchestration is the epitomy of traditional Christmas (carols about Christ's birth, etc). Andrea Bocelli's song ""God Bless Us, Everyone"" is new and exhilerating. Although this movie is mostly drama, comedy sprinkled throughout keeps it light-hearted where it needs to be.
 Some of the scenes may scare small children (they startled me as an adult!); however, if parents watch first, they can fast forward or have little ones close their eyes until those brief parts are over. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!",1294963200,,808,4.9338235294117645

The special effects are wonderful as in most movies but my children did not like this movie at all. They are 7 and 8 years old and they felt it was very scary and could not understand well the movie.

I had to explain to them the movie since the movie is about Scrooge's past life. They couldn't get it why he was old first and then he was a little boy and what was going on. The ghost part was the part they did not like at all but I guess that depends on each child. Some children probably wouldn't get scared with ghosts but mine did.

If your child is ok about ghosts, I do recommend it but I think it is a little difficult for children to understand. There is not much adventure in the movie. My children liked much more ""The Polar Express"" than this one.",1294963200,2,913,4.010989010989011

4159375,3,B003NFM3JK,"This new version of Dickens immortal classic ""A Christmas Carol"",released in Nov/09,tries to breathe new life into a venerable old tale,but unfortunately it misses the mark,sorry to say. Jim Carrey of course is the driving force/voices behind Scrooge and most of the ghosts that visit Scrooge and they have been made to facially resemble Carrey very closely. This is Zemeckis and company trying desperately to do another Polar Express,the one in which Tom Hanks did most of the voices and characters;if only this movie had had the magic that one did. Scrooge here is just a thin,withered version of Carrey. The Ghost of Christmas Past has a candle flame for a head but the face though nondescript,is still faintly Jim's,along with his unmistakable voice in an Irish brogue. The ghost of Christmas present is a huge barrel chested version of Carrey. The facial expressions of all the characters here,like many of the better animated films of recent years(Shrek for instance),are made to match the emotional moments of their particular scene,making them seem all that more real,which in turn heightens the punch.
I needn't go into the story line too much. It's the tale of Scrooge a miserly and miserable old business man who does not make merry at Christmas and despises those who do. One night he is visited by his dead partner who is there to give him a reality check and help him to straighten up and fly right before it's too late. Three visitations by spirits finally turn Scrooge around and he becomes the better human being as a result.
Director Zemeckis has used a deft touch here,following much of the original book but also trying to carve out his own little Christmas Carol niche for himself. He includes some different angles to the story like the long chase sequence with the red eyed horses and his shrinking down to Lilliputian size of Scrooge as his housekeeper sells his bed curtains and he has a tussle with a cat. I found this new stuff really detracts from the main story,as if used as an excuse to lengthen/pad the movie. I might add that I first viewed this movie in the theater in 3-D.I am so glad that the story and production values work at least as well NOT in 3-D,and were not sacrificed at the expense of hyping a new/old gimmick.
The digitally mastered picture here is beautifully crisp and clear and the breathtaking detail is phenomenal. The film is in its original a/r of 2:40:1 and this single one sided disc edition comes in a keepcase. Special features include:a look at the filming and make up process by one of its stars,a look at the making of the film and its retelling,and deleted scenes.
All in all director Zemeckis has tried and failed to do for Carrey what he did for Hanks in Polar Express. The Christmas Carol is a much beloved tale and it will continue to be so in years ahead. But there has been just too much added on in this film and it falters quite fast. Recommended...just.",1294444800,,2925,4.681553398058252

4159377,3,B003NFM3JK,"This is Disney's third version of this story following ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" and ""The Muppet's Christmas Carol"". The third time's not the charm; this rendition is my all time least favorite edition of Dicken's classic.

There's a story in Ray Bradbury's ""The Illustrated Man"", that had authors like Egdar Allen Poe on Mars because their books were burned on earth; Dickens was there because of the ghosts in this story. The filmmakers seemed to believe that this allowed them to make this more of a horror movie than the predecessors; it managed to keep a straight PG rating, but I won't be surprised if the board considered bumping it up to PG-13.

This re-telling of the classic tale of redemption is not completely removed of redeeming qualities. Technically, the special effects of this movie are great. My wife noticed two references of people wishing Scrooge good health even though the good will was one-sided at that time. I also liked this version having Cratchett tell the postscript.

However, the story is as strong as Scrooge. Jim Carey's Scrooge comes across as creepy from scene one. And the special effects are the star here, having Scrooge shrunk to mouse size at one point and being chased by ghostly horses for a long sequence.

My favorite version is Patrick Stewart's, where the actor holds his own with the special effects in that rendition. I also think Allistair Sims' was a much superior version. In fact, the Muppets was better (I haven't seen Mickey's, but I wouldn't be surprised if I like that one better as well).",1294444800,,1548,4.8522727272727275

4159406,5,B003NFM3JK,"Before I say anything else, let me get this out of the way first: If you own a 3D television and a 3D blu-ray player then BUY THIS MOVIE!!! Even if it isn't Christmas season you'll be amazed at the quality of this movie.

OK, now that my initial thoughts are out of there I must admit overall that I was very surprised with this animated take on the classic ""A Christmas Carol"". Everything from the presentation, special effects and animation was top-notch, even the way the story was presented. Although i'm not an aficionado of the original story I'm guessing this movie is more of a tribute to the original book by Charles Dickens. I whole heartedly expected a trivial Disney remake of the classic with the story taking the back burner while the technology of blu-ray 3D takes front-and-center. Low and behold it was anything but that; the 3D was spectacular but the performance capture animation of Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carey) along with the ghosts of Christmas past and present were very believable and stole the show. It is worth mentioning though that some of the secondary characters (such as Tiny Tim's family and other background filler) we're animated without performance mo-cap and it shows. This is akin to CG expressions you'll see in typical video game characters, although that might be changing (ie. compare Bethesda's ""Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion"" to Rockstar's latest endeavor ""L.A. Noire""). Anyways the quality is superb and you'd be forgiven to think that this was an actual film and not computer animation.

The other reason I was very surprised with this movie was the way in which it was presented. Instead of going all typical-Disney on this and candy coating the characters and story, Rob Zemeckis pulled out all the stops to make this a non-stop joyride of a film. Granted you'll be treated to a slow start (give it about a half hour), but at the point where Scrooge meets up with his ghosts is when you'll be glued to the television. To me this was like a Tim Burton-esque presentation whereas the original movies would have you yawning, this rendition scares the crap out of you and has you guessing what the hell will happen next! Again, I was never a fan of the original movie but this one was a surprise that instantly had me devoted as a fan of the film and the Blu-Ray 3D format (along with ""Despicable Me"" as my all-time favorite 3D movie).

Overall this is a no-brainer: BUY THIS FILM. You won't regret it. Seriously, the performance mo-cap is on par with Avatar (for the main character at least) and the way that 3D is represented in this film isn't exaggerated or cliche'. This is the reason why 3D Blu-Ray was created and it's a grossly under-appreciated movie. A must buy.",1293753600,2,2712,4.69327731092437

4159409,2,B003NFM3JK,"I am half way thru, and its been OK, but I was extremely startled by the Dig at Christianity in general and preachers specifically that the Ghost of Christmas Present slips in.
To me it appears, the addition of men of the cloth""  to a lecture on hypocrisy was meant to kick Christians, pastors, priests, etc in the shins.  And on a editorial note, it definitely takes you straight out of the movie.  Which I think is just poor script writing in general - when you watch a movie you should get sucked in - not spit out.

I am not sure if I will finish it - because of that and because all the flying around made me dizzy.  I am glad I just used my credits - I had considered buying it straight out, but I wanted to see if it was any good 1st - glad i didn't get the DVD.

Anyone interested here are the relevant passages from the book and movie.

The book says this:
""`There are some upon this earth of yours,' returned the Spirit,' who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all out kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.'  ""

The movie says this:
""There are some upon this earth of yours who claim to know me and my brothers and do their deeds of ill will and selfishness in our name.  These so called men of the cloth are as strange to me and my kin as if they never lived.  Charge their doing to them, not us.""",1293667200,3,1494,4.082191780821918

I also have several versions of A Christmas Carol and don't need then all to be the same with only the actors being different. I enjoy the retelling from the classic to the Magoo to this version.

So the reason for the 1 star is for the DVD itself. I have no problems playing DVDs on my Denon DVD-2200, but the first disc I bought would stall and freeze, showing pixels. I returned it and got a replacement. That one was even worse. I've played numerous older and newer DVDs on my player before and after trying to play this DVD.

4159412,3,B003NFM3JK,"I thoroughly enjoy ""A Christmas Carol"" by Dickens and have read it a number of times. Like all movies, this one took some creative license in its making. Despite what others have said, there are a number of segments from the Dicken's story left out. There is also a relatively long ""chase"" scene involving the ghost of Christmas future that I found...boring...and misplaced. Really? Scrooge shrinking to the size of a mouse? Other than that, the movie is in the GOOD category... not GREAT... good... not as good as TBS's ""A Christmas Carol"" with Patrick Stewart; and certainly not as great as the 1951 version with Alistair Sim...

1. The animation was wonderful - very cool to watch.
2. It was WAY too scary for a PG rated movie. I have 3 kids ranging from 9 to 3  years old and they were all terrified & covering their eyes AND ears. As soon as they uncovered them, another scary scene came along. It was one scary scene after another. They were too scared to watch most of the movie.
3. The characters use 1800s english, with accents, which was very difficult for my kids to understand. They kept asking me what they were talking about.
4. Overall, I think it was a pretty good movie, but it just wasn't made for little kids. I think it's appropriate for kids ages 10 & up. I'm giving it three stars because I feel that it was marketed to little kids, and was not appropriate. I would not have rented it had I known how scary it was.",1293408000,2,838,4.109756097560975

4159415,3,B003NFM3JK,"Actually that quote is from ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"", but can somehow describe the audio factor to this great looking movie by the makers of The Polar Express. There are alot of familiar dialogue to this well story known to all in civilization, but there are also many adjustments for the 3D generation in regards to action and fantasy. Alot of action sequences have absolutely nothing to do with the true story of Ebenezer calamity in adjusting to his new found life as a mortal redeemed in spirit by three wise ghosts who challange him not to change in light of what they have shown him. The overabundance of laughter from the ghost of Christmas present establishes the fact that only Jim Carrey could have pulled that one off without sounding tired of laughing at the end of it.
The visual trickery of floating in the room's feast peering outward below to the world as if inside a giant balloon is very effective, and a neat little gimmick, accompanied by familiar Christmas anthem.
The only trouble I had with taking Mr. Scrooge seriously as a changed man was I had a feeling he was simply an old crone who was out saving his skin from damnation, and not entirely enthused or having overcome his stupid notions of what life had become to mean to him.
In prior roles, for example, I have seen Scrooge actually look repentant, not only to save his skin, but actually wanting to become apart of civilization of which he thought he lost, and was once beside himself to regain it, and for whatever reason he could think of to do it. The ghosts themselves presented him with life of yesterday he had hold dear, the times of today with which he is apart of, and the sights of tomorrow of which he still has some control of if he decides to change his ways.
It is these ingrediants that overcome his cold spirit in a matter of a few hours, but the Scrooge presented here doesnt seem to change until he becomes frighted out of his bleak skull by falling from the heavens down to earth by himself, or grasping at the edges of his rocking tombstone eventually falling once again into the bowls of hell. These are the things that have changed this particular Scrooge, not because he has reattached his soul for the better, but rather to find a way to avoid unpleasant results by finding a way to behave from the bitter soul he once was. Never does he shed a tear, of which Scrooge most certainly did so before he became a changed man to the world. And for all the fantastic 3D visuals, this Scrooge remains cold, even in the final sequence.
And the three ghosts are the most forgettable ghosts to date, even with the elaborate effects. Strange how that worked out.",1293321600,3,2664,4.506198347107438
4159416,5,B003NFM3JK,"What would Christmas be without a visit to Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol', a story that dates back to 1843 and has been loved and read every year at this time?  There have been other films, stage productions, musicals, and family readings galore and it still holds the magic of what the spirit of Christmas is all about.  Doubtless there will be flocks of naysayers who don't buy into this adaptation by Robert Zemekis, but given the ghost story magic Dickens' created, this film takes it one step further and makes the ghostly three spirits very much alive and beautiful fanciful.

Combining the actors with animation (animating the actors might be a better way of describing the magic) makes each of the many very well known actors who portray the characters that much more credible.  Jim Carrey is at his peak as an actor in his ability to become the illusions his mind creates: he portrays all three ghosts as well a Scrooge at every level of his history.  Other actors who are transformed by Zemekis and staff include Gary Oldman as the trio of Cratchit, Marley's Ghost, and Tiny Tim, Colin Firth as the jovial nephew, Cary Elwes, Robin Wright Penn, Bob Hoskins, Fionnula Flanagan and a host of others.  The costumes and scenery are brilliantly executed.

One problem with the film that may require parental judgment is the fact that the ghosts are truly scary and children might not be able to get past the fear they instill.  But they will grow into the film as it is likely a work that will be resurrected every Christmas season as a tradition.  It is 'excellent, my good fellows'.

4159459,5,B003NFM3JK,"Director Robert Zemeckis (The Polar Express, Forrest Gump) has scored again with this excellent animated version of Charles Dickens' classic holiday tale.  Jim Carrey stars as Ebenezer Scrooge, a crotchety old man who cares nothing about others or the holiday season.  He prefers to spend his time alone in his office or home, sitting in front of the fire.  He also belittles his employee Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman), despite his young son's illness.

On one such evening, Scrooge is in his customary place in front of the fireplace when a ghostly spirit visits him.  The spirit informs Scrooge that he is the Ghost of Christmas Past, and he takes Scrooge on a journey to the Christmases he had as a child and young man.  Scrooge sees where he went to school, and the holiday ball he attended with a girl that later became his wife.  The marriage ended in divorce.  Another spirit, The Ghost of Christmas Present, shows Scrooge the events of the current holiday, including the Cratchit family toasting him for his supplying Bob with a job.  Finally, the Ghost of Christmas Future shows Scrooge close to death, and the town members are rejoicing his passing.  Also, the Cratchits mourn the loss of Tiny Tim.

All of these spirits have a profound effect on Scrooge himself.  Soon, he's singing carols in the street, skating behind carriages, and asking people for forgiveness for the way he treated them in the past.  No one is more surprised at Scrooge's miraculous transformation than Bob Cratchit.

This is an excellent movie.  I've been a Zemeckis fan for years, and my family and I watch ""The Polar Express"" every Christmas season.  I'm sure ""A Christmas Carol"" will become regular holiday viewing for us, too.  The special effects in the film are astounding, and the story contains a fine moral lesson to be learned.  Make ""A Christmas Carol"" part of your regular holiday viewing.  Your family will love it.  Highly recommended.",1292803200,,1931,4.865030674846626

But the 3D version is done beautifully. You could almost feel the snow hitting your face. It is very dark visually (at least on my 65"" Mitsubishi DLP TV played on the excellent Panasonic DMP-BDT350 blu-ray player).

I think it is one of the worst ones out there... I love the actors and couldn't believe how bad this movie was.  It was a horror flick for my little one, - Scrooge looks super creepy and the ghost of Marley is un-necessarily horifying with his mouth snapping out of joint and all... This is NOT a movie to watch with little children!  Actually, my husband didn't want to watch it much past the ghost of Christmas Past.  Many of the important parts of the story were completely left out... for example, the scene where Scrooge's father mistreats him during his youth is not in this movie at all. I also have to say that the ghost of Christmas Past is just a freaky made-up character that looks like a jittery candle with a face... not at all creative in my opinion!

4159470,2,B003NFM3JK,"In the hands of Robert Zemeckis and Jim Carrey, Ebenezer Scrooge's tale delivers moments of true emotion - frightening, heartbreaking and uplifting. Yet, neither the 3-D animation nor Carrey's multi-character act elevate this version to the status of a Christmas classic.

I preface I'm writing this review as a father of two sons (ages 8 and 6). We popped popcorn, poured glasses of Arnold Palmer and slipped into our pajamas for a family movie night. Having recently enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Muppet-Christmas-Carol/dp/B000ATQYT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Muppet Christmas Carol</a>, I hoped my sons could enjoy (and follow) a gloomier interpretation of Dickens' classic that followed the original story closer than I had expected.

Zemeckis employs the performance-capture technique previously used in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Polar-Express/dp/B000Q7ZO8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Polar Express</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beowulf/dp/B001AII4RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beowulf</a>. The animation provides some amazing visuals, making it possible for Scrooge to fly Victorian England or shrink to mouse size for an icicle ride across rooftops. The ghost of Marley and the Ghost of Christmas Future were exceptionally scary (my six-year jumped when Marley's visage first appeared on Scrooge's doorknocker). However, the animation distracts as much as it dazzles, especially during longer stretches of dialogue. Aside from the skeletal Scrooge, Zemeckis envisions the rest of the cast as a fleshy, pig-faced people whose ugliness is off-putting.

Scrooge is an amalgamation of Carrey's previous roles. You'll see a sneer that echoes Count Olaf from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lemony-Snicket-s-A-Series-of-Unfortunate-Events/dp/B0007PICAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events</a>&nbsp;and then hear a laugh reminiscent of The Grinch from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-the-Grinch-Stole-Christmas/dp/B002LMV7TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How the Grinch Stole Christmas</a>. Carrey's performances as the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future are for vanity's sake. My six-year old detected the same actor played Scrooge and the Ghosts, a revelation that only served to pull him from the narrative.

Robin Wright Penn, Gary Oldman, Cary Elwes and Bob Hoskins join Carrey in playing multiple roles. It is hard to understand why though because only Oldman, who portrays both Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit, delivers two unique and satisfying performances. Marley is gruesome (much more horrifying than the Ghost of Christmas Future), while Cratchit is endearing and childlike, especially so during his commute home on Christmas Eve.

In summary, this movie is a mess and falls well short of being a Christmas classic. Dickens classic proves beyond the creative talents of Carrey and Zemeckis, who are unsure how to present this tale. Dark and gloomy dialogue is followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-and-Jerry/dp/B0002MFGCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom and Jerry</a>&nbsp;action scenes.

4159471,2,B003NFM3JK,"Okay, so motion capture animation has gotten a little better, but more on that later!

I've reviewed a few versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" here on Amazon and finally got around to watching this one. Everybody knows the story about Scrooge by now, and I'm too lazy to go over the synopsis, but I will say much of this adaption is beautifully made and it's fairly faithful to Dickens...fairly.

I suppose we've come to expect cinematic adaptations to be a bit over the top. So when Disney and Jim Carrey decided to come out with their own interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge, we had to know there would be physical comedy, chase scenes and overt sentimentality. It certainly wouldn't have the subtlety of Masterpiece Theater (although wouldn't you love to see their take on the story starring someone like, say, Ian McKellen as Scrooge?) Anyway, over the top is certainly what we got. And I don't mind seeing Scrooge flying over London from the second story of his house, or being chased through the streets by a ghostly horse-drawn carriage, or even needlessly shrinking down to the size of a mouse. The problem is there's SO MUCH of this kind of junk involved, it truncates the spirit of the story. If you were to strip away all the goofy additional material, you would realize you're watching nothing but cliffnotes in motion capture. For example, it just seemed odd that Scrooge would get emotional about Tiny Tim's plight considering he barely had time to connect with the lad.

As far as the horse-drawn carriage chase and the Scrooge-shrinkage, the problem is they go on WAY too long! And it seems to me, the purpose of Scrooge witnessing some of these events in the future are defeated while he's preoccupied fleeing from the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come through London streets or avoiding blows from a poker wielded by Old Joe! You'll see what I mean, when you watch the movie.

Jim Carrey actually does a pretty good job as Scrooge. I just don't understand why him. It seems like any number of fine British actors could have voiced the role, or motion captured the role, or whatever the heck you want to call it. He's not particularly impressive as the Ghost of Christmas Present, however, who's maniacal laughing only annoys after a while. Speaking of the Ghost of Christmas Present, what a horrible way to depict his demise. Nothing expresses ""Merry Christmas"" like watching a jolly bearded ghost waste away to bone and ash! Speaking of macabre imagery, I know they meant to be funny when Jacob Marley's jaw cracks open, but double-u-tee-eff? I'm starting to think they missed the boat not having Scrooge resemble Vincent Price! It all would have made sense then! Oh, and I have no idea what was going on with Marley's eyes.

All the other voices were fine, except Colin Firth. An actor I normally love, he seemed to over exaggerate his vocal performance...like he was all too aware he was in an animated feature.

Now about this whole motion capture business. I know they've made some advances in the technology. And it's true the job done on Scrooge himself is the best we've seen so far. But as impressive has his character looks, everyone else still looked (as Dickens described Jacob Marley) dead as a doornail! They just haven't mastered the eyes of the characters and can't shake the creep factor. Perhaps there's something to be said for traditional animation that Robert Zemeckis hasn't figured out. Animated characters should LOOK like animated characters...exaggerated features and all. The more animation strives for reality, the more perfect they need to be in capturing the details, especially the eyes, which are called the ""windows of the soul"" for a reason.

These Zemeckis characters are still soulless creatures unable to depict the subtle emotions of Bugs Bunny, let alone a flesh and blood actor!

I wouldn't say this is the worst adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" I've ever seen as it is handsomely made and highly energetic. Plus, I was intrigued by the Ghost of Christmas Present's lecture regarding ""men of the cloth"". Still, it's pretty close to being the worst!",1292630400,5,4099,4.829059829059829

I'm not going to go into great detail reviewing the film, but Disney sticks to the classic retelling and make no mistake, Jim Carrey is an excellent Scrooge, I loved his accent and he wasn't the wacky Pet Detective...  It's a top notch movie production from start to end.  If I had to nit-pick I'd say the chase scene during the ghost of Christmas future was a bit overdone, but it's a minor nusance as this is one of the best movie-versions of Dicken's story and in glorious 3D, the closest you'll get to going to an actual theatrical production with live actors.

The 1080p 3D was simply outstanding on our Samsung Plasma display.  Incredible depth and detail.  Blows the doors off of the newest 3D version of Polar Express.

4159479,2,B003NFM3JK,"Story:
This is VERY different in many respects from the Dickens story. There are some glaring changes that really take away from the beauty of this classic story.

Changes for 3D effect:
1. The ""flying"" effect with the Ghost of Christmas Present was not, was not even implied, in the Dickens story.
2. Scrooge being chased around the streets of London after meeting the Ghost of Christmas Future.
3. Scrooge being shrunk to the size of a mouse, running around the London sewers, snowboarding with an icicle, and getting nearly pounded by Joe the rag and bones man.

Changes made for no apparent reason:
1. Many important scenes are left out that show the progression of Scrooge from greedy miser to keep of Christmas all year long.
2. The Ghost of Christmas Present dies, rots to a skeleton, turns to dust, and is blown away by the wind.

One change that really, really got on my nerves was the Ghost of Christmas Present making a dig at ""men of the cloth."" I don't know if the writer/director/producer was trying to be overtly anti-Christian here, but that's surely the way it comes off. (Which makes you wonder why they'd make a movie about the miracle of Christmas if they want to be anti-Christian.)

The result is a movie that falls well short of the great film it could have been. For one, it scared my daughter (3 years old) quite a bit; the movie is loud and spends a lot of time getting ""in your face"" for the 3D effects. Also, have I mentioned that the Ghost of Christmas Present, who of course looks a lot like Santa, DIES...and TURNS INTO A SKELETON!

There are some nice extras on the disk. I like watching the technical features about motion-capture, but I had to laugh out loud when the directors, actors, producer, etc. were talking about ""how true they stayed to Dickens' story.""

The story adaptation gets 0 stars, all the little changes add up to this being not a very good telling of the story. The motion-capture, including how amazingly lifelike the facial features came out, gets 5 stars.",1292544000,,2011,4.603351955307263

when he sees the ""Marley Knocker"". The way the Ghost of Christmas Past's Cap goes off like a roman candle sending Scrooge across the sky. The way the Ghost of Christmas Present takes him around on his visit. The way the Ghost of Christmas Present ""dies""  In the clock tower.

4159492,4,B003NFM3JK,"Because I'm a techno-geek, I went to the ""Behind the Scenes"" parts before I ever watched the movie.  While the creators patted themselves on the back about how faithful they were to the spirit (pun intended, I'm sure) of how Dickens probably visualized the movie, I had to see for myself, of course.

Then I watched the movie.  All of my comments are based on what I have always felt about this classic.

The good:
* A very good Scrooge.  Jim Carrey's Scrooge is the Scrooge of my imagination, from my childhood.  This is one time I have to agree with the creators of the film.  This was the perfect Scrooge.
* A very good Tiny Tim.  Ditto for everything I said about Scrooge, this was the perfect Tiny Tim.
*  The doorknocker. FINALLY! One that's true to the book!
*  Jacob Marley rocked. The best, ever. Dickens described the ghost of Marley as having an ""atmosphere"" about him and this movie displayed that.  This was great.
* A very good Ghost of Christmas Past. While this is quite different from what I had always pictured, I liked the interpretation.
* I'm in my late 50s and have been reading this book every year since I was a child (raised my children on that tradition), and have been disappointed with most movie characterizations of these main characters.  If it took ""motion capture"" to get there, then that's okay.  It works.
* The scenery was stellar.
* I have a blu-ray, so really enjoy the increased resolution. As expected, excellent Disney attention to detail.

The not so good:
* Miniaturizing Scrooge. Really?  Couldn't get past the silliness factor of that idea, especially since there seemed no plausible reason as to why it was necessary in the telling of the story.  How in the world was *that* true to what Dickens meant?
* The whole 3D thing was, in my opinion, somewhat overdone.  There are a lot of great parts that I feel were left out in favor of the 3D experiences which had nothing to do with the book.
*  The Ghost of Christmas Future had this whole Darth Vader-ish mojo going when they finally did a closeup of his face.
*  Considering the amount of detail and work put into the movie overall, I was surprised that the ending was so truncated.  Not *disappointed* because it was more accurate than Scrooge running around the floor with a rat (this *is* Disney, after all), but surprised.
* Little details of the book that somehow got either dropped or not fleshed out the way that I expected from a version that was supposed to be ""very true to the spirit"" of the book.

The unfleshed:
* Only one person in Old Joe's
* Fred's party
* Only one of the fund-raisers met with Scrooge after his experience
* Bob Cratchit speaking of meeting Scrooge's nephew after Tiny Tim's death
and a few others...

The deleted:
* The hearse up the stairs.
*  Scrooge's praises of Fezziwig
*  The complete breakup of Scrooge & Belle
*  Belle's family scene

There were several others, but these few scenes were very key to the telling of the story, and I feel that they were eliminated because of the 3D action gimmickry parts.

Overall, I felt that it was a very good interpretation of the book.  It may be a little scary for youngsters, but it *is,* after all, a Ghost story.  I found myself getting quite impatient with many of the parts made to emphasize the 3D effects (flying through the air over roofs and chimneys, getting stuck in the curtain rings, riding an icicle, etc.) because I felt that *some point* it detracted more than added to the quality of the movie.  I don't have a 3D tv yet, but I can see where it would be fun to watch. No, I didn't see the movie in the theaters.

I would definitely recommend the movie.  I can see it becoming a family tradition, especially if there are young children around.  I bought it to show to my grandchildren for the holidays for years to come.  Too bad there's not a version for adults.",1292025600,8,3858,4.472103004291846

4159502,3,B003NFM3JK,"I was expecting to dislike this film. The trailers for it made it seem like sugar-coated ephemera with little relation to Charles Dickens' original novella. Thankfully, the publicity was misleading. Dickens' subtitle for his tale was ""A Ghost Story."" And indeed he filled his prose with deliciously grotesque descriptions of London's dark alleyways (think Jack the Ripper's Whitechapel), a brooding sense that Scrooge has long been due his comeuppance, and, of course, the ghosts themselves. This film doesn't shy away from these darker elements of the story and perhaps comes closer than any other version to capturing its suspense. (The one exception is the classic 1951&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrooge/dp/B000SR0DDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrooge</a>, directed by Brian Desmond Hurst and starring Alistair Sim, with its atmospheric black-and-white cinematography.) On one hand, this is a plus for fans of the book. On the other hand, as with 2007's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridge-to-Terabithia/dp/B00005JPL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridge to Terabithia</a>, parents unfamiliar with the source material may be misled into thinking the film is lighter than it actually is, resulting in much disgruntlement. I fall into the former category and was able to relish the film as a genuine ghost story. Unfortunately, I found the film's stylistic and cinematic finesse often came at the expense of narrative depth.

The title sequence displays Zemeckis' eye for detail. He quite effectively evokes the Dickensian London: dirty, mean, teeming with life and social inequity. This is no idealized, picturesque Christmas town, but a city in the midst of an Industrial Revolution. Once the dialogue ensued, I was pleased to see the script was not watered-down for younger viewers, but borrows liberal chunks of Dickens' prose. Nuances in the text left out of other versions are presented here. We also see, for instance, Bob Cratchit ""[go] down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys... in honour of its being Christmas Eve"" and how ""the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of [Scrooge's] house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.""

The performance capture cinematography itself can be quite stunning. Zemeckis' intention seems to have been to bring to life the classic illustrations of John Leech and Arthur Rackham as opposed to straight realism. The result is somewhat uneven. While some of the character designs seem strikingly realistic, others (like Scrooge himself) are exaggerated caricatures. It takes some time to adjust to this half-realistic, half-illustration approach. Jim Carrey's performance (as Scrooge and all three ghosts) is impressive in its range and ability to convey subtext. At points I feel he's let down by his age (or lack of it) when his voice doesn't quite convey the gravitas of years of loneliness. At other points, elements of his shtick poke through in Scrooge's face and mannerism. Although such moments break up the heaviness of much of the film, it sometimes seems anachronistic. Overall, however, he lends genuine depth and pathos to Scrooge and mirth with a slight undertone of grim seriousness to the Ghost of Christmas Present.

One misstep in the design is Jacob Marley's Ghost, which I found more hokey than frightening. Gary Oldman's voice performance is certainly no patch on the hair-raising portrayals of Michael Hordern (1951) or Frank Finlay (opposite George C. Scott in the brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1984-television-version/dp/B0006419KA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1984 television version</a>). But the three Spirits of Christmas are imaginatively done. This may just be the first time the Ghost of Christmas Past has been depicted as Dickens described him, dunce cap and all. The Ghost of Christmas Present's aging is quite effective, evoking elements of symbolism lacking in other versions. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come gets an interesting treatment, emerging out of Scrooge's own shadow. Also of special note is the musical score by Alan Silvestri which incorporates traditional Christmas carols at key moments. At points, the music can be a little overwrought, insisting too emphatically that the audience notice aspects of the unfolding drama that might be better accompanied by silence, but generally Silvestri alternates between festive buoyancy and ghostly suspense quite effectively.

All that said, the film unfortunately wastes a lot of time on gratuitous scenes that do nothing to advance Dickens' story and exist solely to justify the 3D experience for moviegoers. I wouldn't have a problem with this (the scenes are thrilling enough on my moderately large HDTV; I can imagine they'd be amazing on the big screen in 3D), except that these scenes often come at the expense of narrative. As faithful as the screenplay is in places, a lot of good material is sacrificed for scenes in which Scrooge is flying, falling, or fleeing for no apparent reason. The most conspicuous is one other reviewers have mentioned: a large chunk of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come sequence is devoted to a scene in which Scrooge is chased by a black hearse. On one hand, this underscores the fact that Scrooge does not have many Christmases left. On the other hand, the scene was several minutes long and wastes valuable time that could have been spent on a touching moment from the book in which Bob Cratchit mentions having met Scrooge's nephew Fred at Tiny Tim's grave site. The result? The characterization loses out much of the time to the visuals. The scenes depicting Ebenezer's past and fall into his present miserly loneliness and those featuring the Cratchit family at home, for instance, feel much less developed than in other versions. Tiny Tim himself, the subject of much anxiety and affection in the original novella, gets almost no treatment here at all beyond his obligatory ""God bless us, everyone.""

This lack of characterization is what prevents this version and Carrey's Scrooge, impressive and insightful as it is, from becoming as iconic as Sim or Scott or Patrick Stewart in his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/one-man-audio-version/dp/0743563794/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">one-man audio version</a>&nbsp;or even Michael Caine in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-surprisingly-faithful-Muppet-version/dp/B000ATQYT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the surprisingly faithful Muppet version</a>. With all the attention paid to the stunning 3D effects, Carrey's Scrooge doesn't get the opportunity to be fleshed out into all of its three dimensions. Less time devoted to scenes extraneous to the action and more devoted to the preliminary damning and ultimate reclamation of his soul (the terms in which Dickens described this story), and we could had something more substantial. It's definitely not a lost opportunity. What's here is engaging and often gripping, but I didn't get the sense of catharsis I had with more dialogue-driven (as opposed to visual-driven) versions of the work. If Amazon would let me, I'd rate it 3.5 stars.",1291680000,68,7327,5.6876712328767125

Overall, I think it captures the spirit of Dickens' original work, leaving nothing out. Some may say Robert Zemeckis took too much artistic liberty with Dickens work but I staunchly disagree. The ghosts held up the mirror squarely to Scrooge's face and he had to accept his failures and the very possible consequences of continuing down the path he was currently on. the bestpart of it all though is the fact that much of Dickens' original dialogue from the books are spoken through out the movie.

Every movement/facial expression is done by the actor himself, not just ""animation"". Jim Carrey as always is amazing, but the rest of the cast is outstanding also (Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Carey Elwes). Gary Oldman as the ghost of Jacob Marley is genius!

The pseudo camera perspective was insane and the use of special effects was only because they could do it like changing Scrooge in a tiny man who could slide down a drain gutter.  This movie made no sense and either Jim Carrey has gone off the deep end or had no say in the making of this movie! Do not buy this movie unless you love twisted perversion!

4159530,2,B003NFM3JK,"This was a relatively faithful adaptation of the Charles Dicken's Christmas classic with a few seemingly added-just-for-3D visual sequences that were both annoying and slightly nauseating when watched in the non-3D Blu-Ray version.

My problem with the movie is that the last thing we need is another faithful movie rendition of ""A Christmas Carol,"" perhaps the most filmed story of all time. I was expecting a Disney twist and, I admit, a bit of kid-friendly magic, a la Robert Zemeckis' endlessly charming ""Polar Express,"" and instead got Dicksonian-prose (baffling to most children and many adults) and the occasional uninspired 3D shot, clearly done just for the wow-look-at-that effect. (The shrinking to mouse-size scene was nonsensical, never explained, and clearly done solely to add in some more 3D moments.)

My son was bored and occasionally frightened and I didn't see any point in using name-above-the-title star Jim Carrey, whom I usually despise, but here just found totally generic. (Again, unlike Tom Hanks, who inhabited every role he portrayed in ""Polar Express."") There may have been much Carrey-esque scene munching and physical angst during the motion capture shoot that created this movie, but little of it comes through in the final onscreen product, which I found dull and not even touching, the very thing the original story excels so well at and why it's been a relevant tale for close to two hundred years.

Tiny Tim is barely introduced, and only fleetingly referred to, so our feeling for his disappearance in Christmas future is limited--thus missing the heart and soul of Dicken's story--and Scrooge's redemption is rushed and not at all believable. He seems not a changed man, but rather a still-bitter man now frightened into acts of kindness by an impending demise that never before occurred to him, apparently, despite his wildly advanced age.

Taken solely as an animated adaption of Dicken's tale, the movie is so-so, with a fairly faithful plot line, but with little to appeal to children outside the high-tech computer animation. As a Disney movie, the entire effort falls flat and even the much dated, far lower budget, ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" does a much better job of introducing the story and entertaining younger children. This Carol just wasn't very special, and definitely not deserving of the Disney name. A big miss for me and my family.",1290902400,7,2389,5.133676092544987

Yet there is nothing unique enough to justify this version. It is just a hum-bug. You may be better off reading the book. This story was made as much for children as ""Alice in Wonderland.""

Now if they could have hired the actors to act instead of just twisted versions of their voices, we may have a good movie. If you think that the cheap flashy animation will make it more palatable for children, you may want to rethink. The presentation would have to be morphed in to one of those watered down cutesy things that Disney is noted for. This Marley looks like it was designed by John Carpenter.

Anyway it passes time and if it was the only version you own then it will do.

Scrooge, and ill tempered spend thrift is awaked to his social duty by three ghosts that visit him on Christmas Eve. Who will get the spirit of Christmas, and who will get the goose? (O.K. turkey)

Most people are probably aware of Charles Dickens classic story about an embittered old man being visited by three ghosts on Christmas Eve in a final attempt to salvage his humanity. Most of us eagerly anticipate the latest revisioning of this beloved tale, but its success or failure depends on if we emotionally connect to the characters enough to share in Scrooge's warm and fuzzy transformation at the end of the tale.

There were some interesting riffs off old ideas, but unfortunately this version simply didn't work for me.  The style of animation was weirdly cold and artificial - it felt like watching someone play a ""Christmas Carol"" game on Xbox or PS3. Too bad Disney didn't tap Pixar for this.

The end of the visitation by the ghost of Christmas Present added to the overall macabre vibe.

On Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by his dead partner, Marley that tells him that he will be visited by 3 ghosts who try to change Scrooge's outlook on Christmas. Christmas Past shows him how Scrooge came to be who he was, Present shows him that his nephew feels sorry for him and that Cratchit's family don't have enough money to afford a meal, and the Future shows him what tragedies will happen unless Scrooge changes his ways.

The problem I have with the movie, just my personal opinion, is it tries to alternate between serious scenes and slapstick humor and the mix just doesn't work (for me). Some scenes are recreated in a serious, dramatic way that really convey the spirit of the book.  The passing scenes of 19th century London life add a lot of atmosphere and Carrey does a great (serious) job with the voices.  Then - bam! - some visual gag is thrown in that's reminiscent of Carrey's physical comedy in other movies or a Bugs Bunny cartoon and you're thinking ""where did that come from?""; then just as abruptly it switches back to the standard dramatic story.  The physical comedy might work for little kids but the movie also has some scenes that are too scary/disturbing for young children, so who exactly is their audience?  The last straw for me was a chase scene (really, a chase scene) that was clearly thrown in to show off the particle/water/physics effects of their animation engine, as if we haven't all seen enough animated water by now; you could almost hear the programmers saying ""oh! oh! can we throw this in, it will look so cool.""

If it was supposed to be a comedy, it should have been lighthearted throughout.  If it was supposed to demonstrate that they could make a great Christmas Carol using animation (which they could have) they should have left out the shtick.",1290470400,4,1554,4.629090909090909

It is surprisingly faithful to the Dicken's original, incorporating some scenes that have to my knowledege not made it into other movie versions. My only criticism of the film regards the scenes involving the Ghost of Christmas Future. The segment is a bit over-long, ultra-harrowing, and for that reason, not appropriate for young children, although the rest of the film is.

I consider myself a ""Christmas Carol"" movie buff (of my own making of course), and this version is so close to perfect that it deserves the highest of all reviews.  For those who say that this was meant to be an uplifting story and is too 'scary', I suppose you have never taken the time to read the book.  It is a story of redemption, and of turning a miserable miser into a completely uplifted new man.  A man that was given a second chance at life...and I am sorry, but it would have sickened me to see them portray this otherwise.  In order for man to change, they must see their wrongs and the repercussions that will happen if life is continued being lived without care of others, and this is exactly what Dicken's was portraying, and what the movie came across as. To see it all 'fluffed' up and 'Disney'd' up would just be ridiculing what Dicken's was trying to prove.  I personally love the version with George C. Scott, as well as the classic with Alastair Sim, but when I saw this first last year, I knew that there was a new classic.  All the parts, minor as they may be, that have been left out of previous versions were included, and I thought that this movie hit the book to the 't' and am so glad to have this movie to pass down to others, to show what the book was truly supposed to be like when coming to life in Hollywood.  For those who feel it is too scary, I suggest you show your children Sesame Street or something of the like, because I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but guess what?  Life is not always good, sometimes it can be downright harsh....and this movie put to life what happens when a man who has been a terrible person both inside his heart and out gets a chance at redemption...a second chance to live, and if this is not something your children may understand at their young age, then you may want to just put this on the shelf for a few more years until they realize that life is not full of marshmallows and happiness 24 hours a day....otherwise, sit down and enjoy the movie of a lifetime!",1290211200,5,2248,4.221445221445221

4159582,4,B003NFM3JK,"For the past 40-odd years, my standard in filmed versions of Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" has been the Alastair Sim version from 1951. That remains my standard to this day.

Based on 1983's unsuccessful ""Mickey's Christmas Carol,"" I was prepared for Disney to once again screw up this classic tale with ""Disney's A Christmas Carol."" Jim Carrey's name emblazoned across the 3-sheets added to the sense of trepidation.

Well, I was wrong. Quite wrong, to be honest about it. This is an excellent version of Dickens' classic tale, a version that hews much closer to the book than most other versions out there, including my beloved Sim version. The fantasy elements are here given the room to be fantastic, which really works if one believes that Scrooge's journey to redemption may well have happened in his dreams, rather than in the here and now (pace Mr Dickens' admonition to his readers concerning the veracity of his tale).

Jim Carrey voices and acts most of the main characters in this version, and he's very good at creating unique characterizations that really delineate the players from each other. He is masterful in his portrayal of the Ghost of Christmas Past, somehow speaking in a way that one would imagine a flame would speak had it voice to do so. His Ghost of Christmas Present is also good, a larger-than-life figure who stands in stark contrast to Scrooge's disconnected-from-humanity self. Carrey's Scrooge is - dare I say it - loaded with subtleties that I really didn't expect from him. His voice characterization is spot on, and SO much closer to what one would expect from a faithful rendition of what Dickens penned than say, the disastrous performance of George C. Scott in his 1980's TV version of the tale.

Credit is also due to Gary Oldman's portrayal of Bob Cratchit and - even more so - his Ghost of Jacob Marley, which has to be seen to be believed. One cannot imagine a truer version of Dickens' vision than that achieved in this film's combination of acting, motion capture and animation. Spooky and VERY convincing.

The only caveat I'll voice about the movie concerns a couple of extended ""action sequences"" that were included to no doubt keep the teens and tweens engrossed in the film. Most egregious among these is the scene where Scrooge is chased through the streets of London by a hellish Ciste Bodhar. It really adds nothing to the story, even if the animation is particularly good.

Not everyone is a fan of motion-capture technology, but I feel it serves this film well, bridging the gap between live-action and animation versions of the story and maybe coming away with the best of both worlds. Robert Zemeckis and crew have gained expertise in their use of the technique since ""The Polar Express,"" and it pays dividends here.

The extras included are very interesting, especially a feature that takes us behind the scenes to see just how the motion-capture technology is put to the service of the film makers.

So this is well worth owning, even if it does get numerous plays on various TV channels during the season and - strangely - throughout the rest of the year as well. As a bonus, the singing of the song ""God Bless Us, Every One"" by the highly overrated Andrea Bocelli is limited to the credit run at the end of the film, so you can simply avoid having to hear it at all without missing a minute of the film itself!

Four stars - excellent, but just a cut below my above-declared standard in ""A Christmas Carol"" movies.",1290038400,,3483,4.724876441515651

FIVE STARS!

4159584,1,B003NFM3JK,"""A Christmas Carol"" is my all time favorite story.  I have seen every version ever made including most plays.  This is an over the top Jim Carey movie.  I watched it with my 7yr old grandson and he was so scared he couldn't sleep. All the horror took away from the moral of the story. It makes me very angry that Disney was a part of this. THIS IS A CHRISTMAS HORROR MOVIE not for children. So many good versions out there, get one of them and let Disney know this is UNEXCEPTABLE!",1290038400,10,481,4.150537634408602
4159585,5,B003NFM3JK,"One of the most impressively effective and beautiful 3D movies ever rendered for the new 3D generation.

I have to say that I saw this movie in 3D at theaters.. and it was ok. I say that because I thoroughly enjoyed it, but didn't think the 3D was as phenomenal as other films. I was hesitant to purchase it again on Bluray-3D simply for this fact, but got it through Amazon's Disney discount offer, which made the purchase at a value. Wow, was I wrong with the 3D effects.

The movie looks GORGEOUS on my 3D television. The story is amazingly well done, if not a bit creepy in some parts. It does push the boundaries of a PG film. Some parts, especially the Jacob Marley and third ghost of Christmas Future, are almost too frightening for small children, especially in 3D. But older kids (~8-10 yrs old) would probably love it, even if they do not understand what is being said. The movie uses almost exact prose from the Dickens masterpiece, therefore adults would understand the speech more than their children- after all, the original story by Mr. Charles was written as a ghost story intended for adults rather than for children. The underlying themes and ideas are great for all ages, but better understood and directed towards the lives of adults in this corruptive world that we live in.

Pay no mind to the harsh reviews of others here on Amazon, the movie is excellent. A classic! Jim Carrey truly delivers his best performance, something that my father will watch and be impressed to know that it is actually the goofy, suggestive man that he once despised as Ace Ventura. A redeeming performance on his behalf for a movie of redemption during the holiday season. Zemeckis adds his eye-candy flavor to an already well-established tale to make this a fun and rewarding experience that rivals other holiday films for the best movie to enjoy next to a crackling fire on Christmas Eve. Oscar-worthy performances by all, especially Carrey. Rewarding 3D effects that truly immerse you into the adventure. Well worth its place in everyone's holiday collection. Easily five stars.",1290038400,6,2083,4.7645429362880884
4159586,5,B003NFM3JK,"I saw this movie in 3D last year and really enjoyed it.  So, I was really glad to see it finally on Blu-ray! I have watched it twice since I bought it yesterday.  The Blu-ray quality is excellent.  If you love Christmas movies then you need to see this movie.",1289952000,,259,4.14
4159587,5,B003NFM3JK,"I took my daughter to see this movie in the theater last year. I was so pleasently surprised that Disney actually stuck to the original story with this film. It held all the humor AND the darkness of the book. Be aware that as this does follow the book, it may not be appropriate for small children. Dickens can be very dark, and scary for young ones.",1289952000,4,351,4.253731343283582
4159588,5,B003NFM3JK,"I don't often leave reviews for movies but this one I really enjoyed when I saw it with my husband last year right before Christmas. I was very impressed with the animation, you can practically see Jim Carrey's eyes starring out from Scrooge's face! I mean talk about very expressive animation! And I've always loved A Christmas Carol for the story, such a wonderful redemption story.

I have to say though that I was very surprised at some parts of this movie. Considering that it was rated PG I wasn't expecting some of the things to be in there that were in there. It had some very disturbing scenes in there that I would not recommend for small children. And while I've added this to our Christmas collection for when we do have kids I'm going to wait for my kids to be a bit older to see this one. But I still enjoyed it very much. Jim Carrey definitely delivered another amazing performance.",1289952000,3,897,4.469512195121951
4159599,1,B003NFM3JK,"I had high hopes for this movie. I expect when I watch an animated movie from Disney with my children about Christmas I do not need to screen it ahead of time. I was appaled at how scary they made this movie. Did they really need to have Marley's jaw come unhinged and flop around..and his face rearrange. This movie scared the hell out of my 7 and 5 year old children. They said it should be called a Halloween Carol. To me it was just boring. I was so disappointed and ultimately a little angry that I had to spend the night up with my children who had nightmares over it.
I would not recommend this to children under 10 at all. From now on I will make sure I either watch it first or clear it with a friend that it is ok. It is a shame I have to do that with a cartoon. I was expected something warm and uplifting, like the Polar Express. This was the opposite of that. I HATED it.",1289952000,21,884,4.0

4159602,5,B003NFM3JK,"First of all this review is for the 2 disc Blu-ray/DVD release. I saw this first in theaters, I was amazed at not only the story and digital effect, but the 3D. Disney's A Christmas Carol is by far has the best 3D effects I ever have seen. I wondered if the thrill would transfer to 2D. It did, although there is certain scenes that look a bit off obviously added just for the 3D effect. I was supprised at the bonus features. They were about all a fan of this film could expect or want they follow:
Picture in Picture: by far the best special feature on the disc. It shows the actors as they filmed the movie, black dot's and all.

Commentary:  This is meant to go along with the PIP, but it is optional. Zemeckis' commentary is a little borning but still worth the lisen.

Countdown to Christmas:A frustrating advent calender.

Capturing Dickens:  A short documenty(hosted by a VERY annoying woman) it's informative but a little too short.

On set with Sammi: a featurette were one of the cast members tell us about motion capture

Deleted Scenes: Deleted scenes obviously. They are good and a little fun to watch

Overall I would say that the special features are rather good. The only bad thing I can say is they obsess over Motion Capture too much(We get it's Motion Capture Robert)

Good Movie, although I would think twice before letting little children view it,It's probably the scariest version of A Christmas Carol ever filmed.",1289865600,,1437,4.58203125
4159603,5,B003NFM3JK,"I think the movie is fabulous, however the DVD is not. I found three skips in the disc before the opening credits were completed, and brought it back to WalMart for a replacement. The replacement does the same thing, but I sat through it and logged 9 glitches altogether, not counting a screen freeze that required ejecting the disc and restarting it. WalMart will only replace this defective disc with another defective disc so I guess I'll have to go to Disney with a complaint.

Being Disney and having Jim Carey I was expecting an updated story with some comical twists and some laughs, but there were none.  To be honest, it was boring.  The 3-D was alright, but overall the movie was a big miss.

I'll stick with the Muppet's and Mickey's versions of A Christmas Carol.",1289779200,8,434,4.308641975308642
4159605,2,B003NFM3JK,"I've loved some versions of A Christmas Carol, but for me this one is too loud and in your face for kids under 10 or so.  If you didn't see it in the theater thinking you'd save money and buy it for this holiday season, I have to say I don't recommend it.  If you want a fun family version of this, I recommend going instead with Mickey's Christmas Carol or The Muppet Christmas Carol!

I saw this in the theater with my kids and spent the whole movie helping my son cover his ears in anticipation of the next loud surprise.  When the ghost of Christmas present screams and writhes while he rapidly ages and turns to dust was a low point; it required some convincing that staying for the end would be worth our while.",1289606400,4,717,4.211678832116788
4159606,5,B003NFM3JK,"Just with the shear amount of material they included in this package, the weak sections are buried by getting a great overall product for the money.

I assume one is reading this as a fan of this version so I will skip the content review except to say this is a dark version and there are several scenes that when played in the store scared some of the younger kids. The picture quality is as expected, with flawless details and amazing depth carried throughout. The colors and saturation look exquisite and there are plenty of chances for failure with that floating candle ghost and the amount of dark alleys and rooms. The special features are a serious mixed bag though.

* Making of/Capturing Dickens, 14:39 minutes. Visually narrated by a very irritating actress trying to be funny but she wasn't. Screening it for customers had them asking to fast forward past her to get to the few good points of how they made the film, it is worth skipping this option and watching the next one:
* On set with Sammi, 2 minutes. Short but very informative look into how they did the motion capture effects with her - short but to the point and worthy.
* Deleted scenes, 6 @ 8:39 minutes with quick Zemeckis intro. All are in rough format with the actual actor face(s) placed on the animated characters. Not fun to watch as the format gets distracting. Better at that point to watch the main feature with the PiP.
* 25 Days of Christmas. Cannot stress enough the frustration and unworthiness of this feature. If you do perform this function make sure your player is smoking fast. After it loads up, 25 icons appear on your screen that when selected, a quick or fun little Christmas icon pops up and goes away just as fast, then goes back to menu. It does not let you select ahead so by the time I got to 9 I was fried.
* Blu Ray 3D info with the Lion King critters, 4:13 minutes. A marketing promo for the new format with some stock footage from the films of two of the critters. Skipper.
* Dig Copy promo.
* Disc 2 - DVD with most of the features and specs as listed on the DVD package.
* Motion Capture Picture-in-Picture during playback, optional commentary with Zemeckis. I was disappointed with this as they went with a 10% screen fill instead of a bigger shot. All scenes from credits to credits have the actual footage taken in the effects studio with the actors. Fun to watch to see how the transfers were actually done and what the actors looked like. It plays well in the store for people to see how it was all done, too much going on when the commentary was selected so left that off after the first 10 minutes so cannot review his content.

The picture was beautiful, the DTS was outstanding. Region coded A with 125 points reward card for the Disney site. A definite owner for fans of the film, but still a worthy renter for some BD testing if not a fan.",1289606400,13,2857,4.40719696969697
4159607,3,B003NFM3JK,"This movie is a good take on the same old tale we all come to love. I just didn't expect it to be a little on the scary side. Literally some scene in the movie had made me more tense than some of the horror genre itself. I came in thinking this could be a good movie for the kids on a nice cold holiday season, I came out thinking I better not let them watch it just yet. Other than that the movie itself is decent. The 3d animation seem off just like any movie that uses this photo 3d animation style. But it a good movie to own when the price is right, but I wouldn't get my hope up on it since it is Disney. This version does offer a lot though for the price.",1289606400,2,662,3.8043478260869565
4159608,4,B003NFM3JK,"Robert Zemeckis continues with determination on the path of motion capture 3d animation, and 'A Christmas Carol' is his most successful result so far. However, I think this has more to do with the beautiful, consistent design of the film and the familiarity of Dickens's timeless ghost story than with any marked advances in the animation of virtual humans that could pass for real. The fact that the Scrooge character works quite well is due to its cartoonish look, with enormous protruding chin and nose. Other characters are firmly stuck in what the industry sometimes refers to as 'uncanny valley', that area where virtual humans are not unrealistic enough to make our imagination fill in the blanks, but are afflicted with subtle unrealities that make them look like really weird, strangely repulsive real people. Mouths and eyes in particular remain problematic. The digital versions of Colin Firth (Cousin Fred) and Gary Oldman (Bob Cratchit) that we encounter are rather startling.

As an adaptation of Dickens's story for the screen, none has yet been more faithful to the original. Not only is Zemeckis textually true, but he captures the eerie atmosphere of Dickens to perfection. This is therefore a very dark, at times scary Christmas Carol, definitely not suitable for young children, I would say. On the other hand the director has allowed a few flights of fancy. The appearance of the Ghost of Christmas Past as a living candle I found quite brilliant, and the dance floor antics of Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig are bound to draw a few laughs. Other additions are less succesfull and some, such as the overdone chase of Scrooge by the Phantom Hearse, are at odds with the atmosphere of the story and apparently only there to spice up the 3d version of the film.

Jim Carrey is less of a problem than I had feared, and though he voiced the ghosts as well, I didn't even recognize him there. The continuous, joyless fake laughter of the Ghost of Christmas Present I did find pretty annoying, though.

Unfortunately, due to the fast pacing of the story (and time taken up by unnecessary additions, such as that chase scene I mentioned) I did feel that Scrooge's character change comes about rather abruptly, without allowing enough time for a believable thawing of his cold heart. And at the end a general sense of unpleasantness remained that I find hard to pinpoint and may have something to do with that 'uncanny valley', combined with the abundance of dark and  morbid imagery. Nonetheless, an intruguing excercise in gothic spookiness; and as a feast for the eyes this is quite recommendable; you won't ever see a more Christmassy London than you get here here.",1289606400,4,2672,4.878854625550661
4159619,4,B003NFM3JK,"I would rate this movie as 4 stars out of 5. Jim Carrey was excellent as Scrooge, and the animation and effects were top notch, although I felt that the use of 3D was a little forced. I did find it strange that they really didn't update the dialogue to present day from the standpoint that I felt children would be confused by it, but if you are a fan of Dicken's work it really is a treat that they didn't Disneyize the dialogue so that it would appeal to today's generation",1289433600,,475,4.173913043478261

But for the performance side, it is still something apart from the industry standard animation in his animated movies. I felt that it's really not understandable why his previous films such as Polar Express,  Monster House,  and Beowolf are motion-captured animated films that give me some scary uncanny valley experience. I would say he should use the most great merit for the animation medium, simplifying the movement to tell the story efficiently.

Of course Jim Carrey is great in his triple role as is Gary Oldman, Robin Wright Penn and Colin Firth. The atmosphere is dark and cheerful at the same time and every single scene adds to the picture.

A Christmas Carol is a great film with a great story and heart. This combo pack is the best way to see it both in HD and SD and to not pay more for a 3d bluray (which I can't use it, and don't care about it) and a digital copy (waste).

With Polar Express and this one, they are both stories which strain under his efforts to make them feature length through pointless lengthy action, over-dramatic pauses, and obvious hamming on the CG process.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, then observe as you and your friends look at each other saying, ""why doesn't he just get on with it?"", and sigh loudly as moments are stretched intolerably. There's a ""roller-coaster"" sequence near the end that made me almost walk out on it. On the upside, the performance capture of Scrooge is pretty good, and each frame looks like a painting.

Companies are always pushing new technology onto the public before their current technology is worn out.  In this economy who has 3 to 4 thousand dollars to upgrade their equipment when they already have BluRay and HD hardware.  Rich people I suppose.  With a large chunk of the country out of work who do they think can buy the new hardware.

That is unbelievable in these hard economic times to expect people to go out and buy new expensive hardware for the few movies that will be available in the theater version 3D.

I found some details in this film that I have never seen in any adaptation of the story; the story is adapted well. There are two negatives in the movie. 1)Occasionally the 3D was used solely for 'awe' factor. I can get over this one because the 'awe' factor was pretty amazing. 2)There is a scene during the Ghost of Christmas Future segment (the one where Scrooge in miniaturized) that I thought was simply added because the producers thought they needed some action before the conclusion.

STARRING: The Voices of: Jim Carrey, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Robin Wright Penn, Bob Hoskins and Carey Elwes

WRITTEN BY: Robert Zemeckis; based on the novel by Charles Dickens

DIRECTED BY: Robert Zemeckis

Rated: PG
Genre: Animation / Drama
Release Date: 06 November 2009

When it comes to animation, it doesn't get any better than the master himself; Robert Zemeckis. He changed the face of animation forever with his classic Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Years later he dazzled all of us with The Polar Express and his legendary adaptation of Beowulf. Now, he's done it once more with his latest masterpiece from Walt Disney: A Christmas Carol.

I don't know of any story that's been retold more than this one, and rightfully so. It's been around for nearly 200 years, and I'm sure Zemeckis's version won't be the last to be seen.

I'll take the liberty of assuming that everyone is familiar with the plot, and just highlight the key points: Ebenezer Scrooge absolutely despises Christmas and everything to do with it. He has a massive fortune but not so much as a single friend, and treats everyone like rubbish. Seven years after the death of his partner Jacob Marley, he will be visited by the ghost of Marley as well as three other specters (the ghosts of the past, present and future) on the night of Christmas Eve. The ghosts will show him visions of his past, present and future and the life he has lived and will live, if he does not change his twisted ways.

You get what you'd expect from the plot, yes, and you've seen it a hundred times in other forms, yes; but you have never seen it quite like this. Despite being a huge Robert Zemeckis fan and maybe even a bigger fan of Jim Carrey, I too had these same thoughts going in. But as I was, you too will be amazed.

The animation is nothing short of incredible. Several times in the film, I thought I was looking at real people and actual sets, for a few seconds. It's truly impressive. This will no-doubt be a must-own on Blu-ray! The colors are vibrant, the picture is crystal clear and the sound quality is truly spectacular.

You can see Jim Carrey and Colin Firth and Gary Oldman, hidden in the characters they voice, and it's awesome! I'm sure that the actors physically acted out these scenes at some point during the process in addition to the voice-over-work, as their physical movements are all very life-like.

Jim Carrey plays Ebenezer Scrooge exceptionally well and we have never seen the character more hideous and vial. He is terrifyingly thin and oddly hunched over and looks like he's ready to croak any second. His voice is raspy and dry and it makes your skin crawl.

If you are expecting to laugh during the film, DON'T. The laughs are scarce as this is a very heavy drama indeed. In addition to the drama, it's very dark as well, so you may want to re-think taking smaller children. The spirits are scary and there are several moments where things jump out at you and make loud unsettling noises.

What makes this so different from other versions of the classic Dickens tale, aside from the obvious beautiful look the film offers, are the moments where Scrooge is visited by the ghosts.

Robert Zemeckis wrote the script in addition to directing the film, so it is very much his spin on things. The three entities are all different from what we have seen in versions of the past and they offer a nice touch to the story, cinematically. They don't crowd the scenes they're in. They take Scrooge where he needs to go, and offer him minimal guidance and that is good for the kids; they will be able to learn the valuable lessons of this story, from seeing what's happening with the characters, versus the ghosts telling us and Scrooge the implications his actions have and will cause.

We also go on spectacular thrill-ride adventures with Scrooge as he is hurled through the streets of London, and shot into the sky like a rocket.

Zemeckis and his team of animators have created a gorgeous London for this story to unfold in. I think that's one of the best elements to animation; you can create interesting and majestic worlds for your characters to live in, without limitations to reality and visual believability.

There are a ton of animated movies that youngsters will love watching, but parents would rather have heart surgery than sit through. There are also several animated films parents don't want their kids to see due to its content and subject matter. Disney's A Christmas Carol is something parents will find comfort in their children watching, and they will undoubtedly enjoy themselves as well.",1279756800,5,4609,4.67037037037037
4159646,3,B003NFM3JK,"Taking a piece of literature and turning it into a feature film is a risky endeavor. By taking your own vision and projecting it into a form everyone can see, you're instantly setting yourself up for constant criticisms thoughout the film...""Well this isn't how I pictured this city to look at all""...""She shouldn't look like that, I thought she would be ______""...""He lived in the book, why did he die in the movie""...The more well known the book/story is, the more this will inevitable happen as well.

I mention all of this, because 2009's A Christmas Carol, will take most preconceptions of what Dickens' story portrayed, and twist them visually in some strange ways. One quick thing to note about the movie, is that only a handful of characters look ""good"" in the animation style that the film uses. Scrooge, the ghosts, and one or two other main characters look normal, but the rest of the people in this world are extremely creepy looking, almost like something you would see from Lord of the Rings.

The film opens with Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) seeing his dead partner's corpse, pronouncing him dead, rips off the funeral workers (setting his ""scrooge"" ways in action), and leaves the morgue, which starts a fly-by of the city and it's villagers while Scrooge is traveling to work. Upon arriving to his office, the movie fast forwards seven years into the future, and starts the classic tale we all know. We meet Cratchit (Gary Oldman), who is extremely creepy looking, and we meet two of the charity collectors who Scrooge decides to take down a few notches. Scrooge's nephew Fred (Colin Firth) comes to invite him to family dinner, but Scrooge quickly points out how much Christmas is worthless, and he wouldn't dare be bothered to arrive. At the end of this work shift (Dec 24th), Cratchit asks to have all of Christmas off, which sets Scrooge off into another one of his trademark fits, but is eventually allowed to spend the day with his family, only if he comes into work early on the 26th.

This is the point where the film takes a lot of weird turns, and if you truly enjoy the classic film/novel versions of Christmas Carol, you will probably not enjoy the next 40-50 minutes of the movie.

Scrooge gets home, and upon arriving to his front door, sees a ghosts face on his door knocker. He gets startled, and falls down his front steps in what looks to be a painful way. One thing throughout this movie, is that Scrooge is constantly falling/getting beat up, and it never seems to affect a man who must be 60-70 years old. While sitting in his bedroom, he starts to hear his door rattle, and then the ghost of Jacob Marley appears. By appears, I mean throws ghostly metal boxes through the door at Scrooge, and then eventually comes in after them. They talk about the three ghosts coming to visit Scrooge tonight, and Marley lets him know the times they are coming.

/* I don't know if it was just me, but if you listen to the times that the ghost gives for the visits, they don't match up with the timeline of the movie */

Marley's ghost does all sort of weird things while he's talking, such as ripping his jaw off, and then slapping it up and down on his mouth, to talk to Scrooge, and then pulls it over his face to finish the conversation. This is one of those weird moments that started to ""ruin"" the movie for me. I realize it's a retelling, and the director can do whatever he wants, but it just seems like they want to make the movie ""extreme"".

Marley's ghost leaves, and the story progresses as you would expect. The Ghost of Christmas Past (Jim Carrey), which is a ghost body with a candle's flame for a face/head, shows Scrooge his sad childhood. The Ghost of Christmas Present (Jim Carrey), is a big jovial man (about 20-30 feet tall) who shows Scrooge how much fun people can have being either poor, or without his miserable company. These two ghosts, while visually weird looking, are pretty spot on to how the original book was written.

The Ghost of Christmas Future, is the one which bothers me the most. The ghost is the Grim Reaper (which is fine), but the sequence of events involving him are ridiculous. This part (maybe 5-10 minutes), is slapstick comedy, where Scrooge is somehow shrunken, talking with a squeaky ""I've been shrunk"" voice, and falls through street drains and runs through pipes in an attempt to get away from the ghost. This scene goes on way too long, and you'll eventually find yourself asking when the ghost will finally catch him to continue the story.

After all of the visions are done for the night, Scrooge wakes up, feels proud to be alive, and runs through town celebrating his new found love for everyone. There's a few touching moments here as Scrooge rights his wrongs, but nothing that wouldn't be expected.

As a whole, the entire movie is one of those feel good Christmas stories, where you can watch it with your family, and maybe learn a life lesson or two throughout. The major flaw I see with this adaptation, as I said earlier, the visuals will either make or break this movie for you, but other then that, I have no real complaints.",1279670400,2,5118,4.583606557377049

On front of that cover, there's a blue circle sticker says ""Looking into a ticket inside to see - The Sorcerer's Apprentice - only in theaters."" After removing the shrink-wrap, I could see shiny, glossy & embossed figuring/lettering on the front slipcover and glossy/mirror on the back.

Again, where the old laughing Santa Claus & Scrooge were flying underneath the floor, I felt like my body swings back and forth.

The obvious usual suspects were included in this remake, ie, ghosts, Scrooge, Tiny Tim (briefly), friends of his through the past.......but I felt something was missing.

It is also a movie where the 3D effects seemed planned and enhance the scene.  For example, when looking inside Nephew Fred's, there is a layer of snowflakes, the layer of the exterior and then the characters in the interior.  Well done!  Carrey does a good job of being Scrooge... he is a bit over-the-top for my tastes, but not bad.  The movie got 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't find him believable as the 3 ghosts.

As far as the film itself I thought it was a good update on a classic story. While I don't consider myself an aficionado, I do know the story well and found it stayed true enough to it. The warmth and humanity of the characters is definitely still present. Then of course there is the 3D aspect, which completely blew me away. I've seen most of the 3D releases in the last year or so, and with the exception of Avatar this movie did the best job of utilizing it. Actually, I am more excited about this movie being released in 3D than any other movie, including Avatar. I'm just happy you'll be able to buy this movie alone and not bundled along with a TV.

4159665,5,B003NFM3JK,"As another reviewer stated I also consider myself a Christmas Carol afficionado.  I read the book each season and watch every version I own, which is substantial.  I find it to be quite faithful to the book exept for the few instances he mentions.  Yet, the film does contain other minor details such as the fact that Scrooge was suffering a cold at the time.  However, they do not ruin the movie for me at all.  Can I do without them?  Yes, I can but they do not in any way detract from a wonderful movie that stays very close story-wise and dialogue-wise.

This movie is absolutely gorgeous to view.  I can not wait to get this on Blu-Ray.  It completely captured the feel of an 1800's England Christmas.  I found the ghosts to all be unsettling and as my wife said ""That was actually scary!""  It may not be for kids to be honest.  And I think that was the point - this wasn't originally written for children, it is a Christmas ghost story which was a very popular thing to do at the holiday times then.  The ghosts weren't there to be nice and helpful, they were in Scrooge's life to matter-of-factly show him how he screwed up.  I never got the feeling in any CC media that the ghosts truly cared for Scrooge's well-being.

Anyways, this is now an annual staple for my holiday traditions.  P.S., I never really cared for Jim Carrey either.",1277078400,148,1343,4.376518218623482
4159666,1,B003NFM3JK,"I can say without reservation that this is the worst version the Carol that I have ever seen.
I am somewhat of an aficionado of the Carol so I really looked forward to Disney's release.  I went to the first showing of the first day of release (November 6,2009)and settled down to enjoy myself.
I had really hoped that Robert Zemeckis would work his magic but, unfortunately, like most adapters of the Carol he felt the need to ""improve"" it.  What he ended up doing was somehow removing most of the warmth and humanity from Dickens' well-loved story.
I will admit that Mr. Zemeckis uses much of the original dialogue from the book throughout this movie but most of the action is heavily modified or totally new, and is, to anyone who is familiar with the book, intrusive and irritating.  For example, in the book the door knocker changes into Marley's face and then disappears.  Here it not only appears but also screams in Scrooge's face causing him to fall down the front steps.  When Marley enters the room he doesn't just enter the room, he throws several of the heavy boxes he is chained to through the door first.
When the ghost of Christmas Past appears he looks like a candle and his head is, in fact, a candle flame floating above his body.  At the end of this session Scrooge jams the candle-snuffer over the ghost's head just as in the book.  Unlike the book he holds on to the snuffer and it suddenly blasts off like a rocket taking him high into the sky, then disintegrating and leaving him flying.  He sails past the face of the moon in a scene reminiscent of E.T.s famous scene then falls seemingly miles toward the ground before waking up on the floor beside his bed.  The whole segment is gratuitous and, quite frankly, childish.
When the Ghost of Christmas Present appears the ceiling in Scrooge's room is suddenly about 50 feet high.  The Ghost looks exactly like Jim Carrey with the beard and his expressions are the same smirking expressions that Carrey usually displays making the Ghost, at least to me, very unpleasant.  One of the things that made this segment so important in the book was that the Ghost took Scrooge around London and let him mingle with the people (albeit invisibly) to get a feel of the holiday spirit.  Here, the Ghost apparently lifts the upper story from Scrooge's house and they fly around the city in it.  Part of the floor becomes transparent and Scrooge observes everything as if on a television screen.  Yes, he sees what's going on but, he does not mingle and there is no feeling of his gaining humanity.  At the end of this segment the Ghost says that he only lives for one season and abruptly ages, dies (while still laughing Ho, Ho, Ho) rots and turns into a skeleton, then disintegrates into dust and blows away.
The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come segment is, quite frankly, very frightening.  Unlike most versions of the Carol the Ghost is mostly shown only in the shadow and becomes solid only rarely.  There is a long segment which I found to be not only frightening to a younger child but totally outside the spirit of the book, gratuitous, and frankly stupid.  The Phantom Hearse, mentioned only briefly in the book, chases a terrified Scrooge for what seems like miles.  For some unexplained reason Scrooge suddenly shrinks until he is smaller than a mouse, he slides along a rooftop smashing into icicles, then falls off the roof and lands in the bag of the charwoman, Mrs. Dilber, who is taking Scrooge's belongings to sell.  Scrooge witnesses her total lack of feeling for him and is aghast at how easily she stole things from him, still not realizing that in this future he is dead.
In the graveyard scene Scrooge, who is now again full size, is understandably terrified and, as in several other versions, he falls into his own open grave and he, and the audience, realizes that it ends in Hell.  He is, of course, saved and reformed in the end but the feeling is not that he was reformed so much because of what he learned as that he is frightened into it.
Throughout the movie Scrooge is thrown, launched, battered and generally physically abused for no apparent purpose and with no apparent damage.  The ghosts, up to and including Marley, do not seem to be the friendly, helpful and caring spirits of the book but seem, instead, to be enjoying making Scrooge suffer rather than helping him to learn.  Overall I found the movie to be cold, depressing and one of the least satisfying versions of A Christmas Carol that I have ever seen.  I own more than 20 different versions of this story on tape and DVD.  This version will NOT be part of my collection.",1276905600,105,4623,4.574545454545454

I am somewhat of a ""Carol"" buff and  I like to see different versions.  Besides....Jim Carrey as Scrooge?  Give me a break!  But after reading the reviews I thought I'd give it a try.  However, I went into the theater with my mind pretty much made up that I would hate it.

Boy was I wrong.

I was pleasantly surprised by this little gem.  Jim Carrey is no Alastair Sim (but then...who is?) but I could tell Carrey studied Sim and brought a little of Sim's portrayal into his own.  The animation and voice acting were very well done.  This film is also as faithful to the book as any version I've seen.  I liked how they showed Marley's hair agitated as if by hot air (per the book) and the fiddler at Fezziwig's party plunging his face into the punch bowl before resuming his playing (also in the book...and I've never seen this in a film before).  Another thing I enjoyed was the fiddler playing ""Sir Roger DeCoverly"".  I like this tune...it is in the book...and I expect it to be in any filmed version.  Silly...but that's just me.

I only have two negative comments...I thought the pace was a little too slow at the beginning, and that ridiculous unnecessary and over-long ""chase"" scene (with a miniature Scrooge).  That did not belong in the movie in any way, shape or form.

The 1951 version with Alastair Sim is still the ""gold standard"" in ""Christmas Carol"" films.  But this one ranks #2 on my list.  I can't wait for it to be released on blu-ray, where it will take its rightful place in my holiday video lineup.",1266192000,,1643,4.374172185430464
4159669,5,B003NFM3JK,"This is a superb movie.  Robert Zemeckis, Jim Carrey, Gary Oldman, et al. give us a movie of ""A Christmas Carol"" that, while animated, demands to be seen with the same sophistication and maturity level as its live-action counterparts.

Actually, this reminds me of older Disney films, with the visual artistry of ""Banbi"" or ""Peter Pan.""  In more modern times, Japanese anime seems to be a stylistic influence on this picture.  Jim Carrey is positively brilliant as Ebenezzer Scrooge, in addition to every ghost outside of Jacob Marley.  It is truly astounding how Carrey makes the viewer forget his claim to fame as a comedian and marvel at his vocal work, as he effortlessly runs a very wide gamut that puts him in company with the animation vocal artist masters.

Gary Oldman is also a standout vocally in three roles, as Bob Cratchit, Jacob Marley, and Tiny Tim.  As Marley, he is particularly impressive as a model of fierce repentance and conviction.

If you're a parent of a young child, please try to take the time to screen this in advance of them seeing it.  It is not geared for children, and does not make storytelling concessions for them.  Every child is different, but I am trying to give a fair warning.

This is a brilliant movie that does not sacrifice a mature Dickensian feel one bit.  It will probably be nominated for a Best Animated Feature Oscar, and I highly recommend seeing it.",1262736000,,1403,4.704918032786885
4159670,3,B003NFM3JK,"Robert Zemeckis' new ""A Christmas Carol"" story is an animated film using the art of ""performance capture,"" where actors' movements are digitally recorded and translated into CGI. So what you will see here is not Jim Carrey himself, but the computer graphic animation of Jim Carrey. Considering his superb performance as Count Olaf in ""Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events,"" I think Jim Carrey playing Scrooge in a live-action film would be a better choice, but it seems Mr. Zemeckis didn't think so.

(By the way, I have watched the film in the conventional 2-D format. These 3-D glasses are too much of a distraction for me.)

The classic story of Charles Dickens needs no new introduction. Old miser Scrooge is given a chance to reform his life through the visitation of three ghosts. The basic storyline remains the same in Disney's adaptation, but it seems Robert Zemeckis thought he needed something new to sort of spice up the content.

Besides the aforementioned performance capture and 3-D, Robert Zemeckis-directed ""A Christmas Carol"" stars Jim Carrey in multiple roles. That means he plays Scrooge (young and old) as well as the three ghosts. Not only that. Most co-stars play more than one character in Mr. Zemeckis' version. So, (animated) Gary Oldman ""plays"" the three roles - Bob Cratchit, Marley and Tiny Tim. But what is the point of doing this?

The tone of the film is also pretty different at times, compared with other versions. As some reviewers have pointed out, some scenes (especially the entrance of Marley's ghost) will be scary for kids and, perhaps, even for adults. The second half of the film contains a rather lengthy ""chase"" scene of the mouse-sized Scrooge. But do we really need this?

Obviously Robert Zemeckis, whose recent works include ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf,"" thinks the cinema's future lies in the advanced visual technologies. Whether he is right or not is yet to see, but for those who still remember Mr. Zemeckis as the creator of imaginative and innovative ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" like me, what really matters in making people happy is something else.",1262476800,,2118,4.971751412429379

The need to drive fear into Scrooge is critical to his transformation, making this inappropriate for easily frightened small children -- I did bring my 4 and 6 year old to see the movie, and it was all right, but I might not do it a second time because the effects were quite potent.  That being said, I would like to see it myself again in 3D.

Interestingly, Scrooge does seem to do a lot of falling in the movie...

""Marley was dead: to begin with.""  The story is a classic.  Many of the lines in most versions, even 1960s TV cartoons, are lifted word for word from the text of Dickens' story.  We are NOT going to get surprises here.  We should know this going in as surely as we know ""Marley was dead: to being with.""

The 3D effects in this version were a bit overdone in places.  The director seemed to forget the story in favor of the effects.

4159673,4,B003NFM3JK,"I agree with the other reviewers that the animation was outstanding. The level of detail and the visual effects were simply amazing. Concerning the 3-D effects, I would say that they made the movie dimensional, but there were not many of those ""coming right at you"" types of effects. Rather the 3-D added a higher level of realism to the movie. The only 3-D effect that seemed to come right out of the screen was the snow, and this was happening throughout a large portion of the movie. I found it distracting after a while.

I do agree that this movie is clearly not for children. It was almost always dreary and dark, and children would find it scary. In addition, something I haven't seen mentioned is that the dialogue is written as if this were an English period movie. I have to admit there were times I couldn't grasp what was being said, and this usually isn't a problem for me. My wife who loves period movies also had the same problem. I think children would get very lost quickly.

We're big fans of Jim Carrey. Carey's so unique and so talented, and he did a great job. However if you're expecting anything funny because he's playing the lead, remember that this movie does not have comedy.

Despite all of the things that are great about this movie, frankly I got bored (Please don't batter me because I'm sharing my opinion. I realize a lot of people will justifiably love this movie, but there will be others who are similar to me and will want to know what to expect).

My favorite version of A Christmas Carol is Scrooged with Bill Murray. It was funny, entertaining, edgy, creative and so engaging. It got the message across, and I enjoyed the humor. This movie version was quite the opposite: Dark, serious, scary enough to potentially disturb children, and dreary. Of course there's nothing wrong with this, but it just didn't appeal to me, or hold my attention.

Regardless, the story has a wonderful message, and this movie is fantastically crafted. Many people will justifiably love it.",1261180800,,2009,4.632022471910112

4159675,4,B003NFM3JK,"Director Robert Zemeckis continues in his fascination with motion capture, delivering both his best-looking and most successful example to date with this umpteenth version of Charles Dickens' 1843 novella.  The technology allows for two major achievements: a spectacular and colorful recreation of early Victorian London with many long takes, swoops and crane shots that are to my eyes more reminiscent of early Disney features in their smoothness and eye for detail than most modern animations; and the playing of multiple roles (all three Ghosts and all ages of Ebenezer Scrooge) by star Jim Carrey and several other cast members.

Not being previously an enormous fan of Carrey, nor of the direction Zemeckis has gone in the past couple of decades (though I remain a huge fan of the BACK TO THE FUTURE films and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT), I can't say that I had the highest of hopes for this, but on the whole both the film and Carrey won me over.  Despite the immense cost and the technological innovation of the thing, this is at heart a fairly conservative and faithful adaptation; little of Dickens' dialogue is changed and all the essentials of the story are kept though, as with every film version I've seen, some segments are shortened and others more drawn out.  The sequence with the Ghost of Christmas Present is kept mostly to focusing on Bob Cratchit and Scrooge's nephew; the following scenes stretch out the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come for a nightmarish chase sequence that for me was the weakest part of the film.  Few concessions are made to the youngest audiences, who probably won't understand a fair amount of what's going on at all times and will be focusing instead on the eye candy filling the screen, of which there is plenty - makeshift toboggan rides down the street, complex multi-layered screen compositions in the ""Christmas Present"" sequence, the multitude of ghosts floating outside of Scrooge's window, a shrunken Scrooge being chased like a rat in the ""Yet to Come"" scene, etc.  The photography is spectacular, the colors vibrant, the feeling if not Dickensian then at least...different.

But ultimately any Christmas Carol rises or falls on the strength of its Scrooge, and Carrey for the most part doesn't disappoint.  He's as nasty and venal in the early scenes as any Scrooge on record, but this film takes more care than many to show just how organic his development from lonely boy to aspiring businessman to bitter recluse has been.  He makes you frustrated, that a man so abused himself, and who has made so many mistakes, can continue down this dark path; a humanized yet nonetheless frightening and truly unpleasant venality.  And his transformation is fairly believable, though I think if more time had been spent with the second ghost, and less on the silly chase with the third it might have been even more cathartic.  The only real problem with him is that at the end he channels the 1951 performance of Alastair Sim - still the best known of all Scrooges - a little too closely I think.  All in all, fine work though, with his plasticine features and serviceable British accent finishing the characterization nicely.  Bob Hoskins and Gary Oldman do fine in multiple roles as well, really there is nothing for me to complain about in terms of the casting.

Zemeckis (who also wrote the screenplay) definitely highlights the spiritual themes of the story; there's a striking sequence where the camera pans over a church with the cross very blatantly foregrounded, and the soundtrack choices included several specifically Christian carols.  He doesn't, though, rub the audiences' noses in the religious elements, and this Christmas Carol, is, as it should be, a mix of dark pessimism at the nature of capitalism and greed, mixed with an optimism that man, even a man as desperately hollow and spiritually poor as Scrooge, really does have the capacity to change, and that goodwill towards his fellow man is the real path to salvation - on earth or in whatever heaven one wants to believe in.

For me the Brian Desmond Hurst-directed 1951 film with Alastair Sim remains the benchmark for this story, but it's no shame to fall in the shadow of that film, and Zemeckis and Carrey's work, clearly a labor of love just as much as commerce, will take it's place as a classic too, I suspect.",1260921600,3,4349,4.856756756756757
4159676,5,B003NFM3JK,"I came with an open mind. This, after all was the story my father had told us children, when we were snuggled up warm in our beds. He would plant a dining room chair in the hallway. And from memory he recited ""the story of Scrooge.""  It was a little frightening, to be lying there in darkness, a bit of light streaming in from the hallway, as your father's voice suddenly turned all funny. He became, in turn, three spirits - voices different from Scrooge's own.

Dad did that each Christmas eve. Until we grew ""too old for that,"" as he explained one year while putting his shaving soap on the tree, after putting up all the decorations, including the battered angel - the one my Mom got, that first Christmas in 1936 when Dad planted his first kiss on her lips, as they danced (he said) to English band leader Ray Noble's THE TOUCH OF YOUR LIPS.

Pardon my reverie . . . I just wanted to establish my credentials, for saying . . .

This is not merely the best version of my favorite story (Dad would tell you that; if he were alive this would be his 92nd Christmas).  No, no. This is the most amazing ""movie experience"" that I have ever known. I cannot imagine how any film maker(s) could ever top this.

They had me hooked from the opening.  The camera shows a beautifully bound copy of ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens. An invisible hand opens to the first page and those very words my own father composed . . .

Marley was dead: to begin with.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner.  Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge's name was good . . .  for anything he chose to put his hand to.  Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

We see a corpse, its eyes held shut with pennies. Scrooge himself removes them from the eyes, at the end of the scene saying, without shame to the undertakers, while rubbing the coins together between thumb and finger, ""Tuppence is tuppence!"" The subtle change in the undertaker's face -- so subtle you might miss it in the half light of the almost dark room -- is one of dismay at seeing someone THAT cheap. The facial expression borders on horror.

Out in the street, children stop playing and dogs duck into alleys at Mr. Scrooge's approach, on his way to his place of business, with its gilt-lettered sign, ""Scrooge & Marley Co.""  That will also be the closing scene of the movie, with Scrooge seen through frosty windows to be dancing with sheer, child-like joy, while outside, Bob Cratchit, for the very first time, turns to the `camera' and addresses us:

(Those very words my father composed out of thin air, Christmas 1949!)

""Scrooge was better than his word.  He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father.  He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew [and] ever afterwards, it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.  May that be truly said of us, and all of us!  And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God Bless Us, Every One!""

I could share with you a hundred little details (the sort of details that otherwise concern ""God and the Devil""). But ""Let there be light!"" sums up the effect on your eyes, as we see clearly despite only the very faintest light sources: and that is what sets this movie apart from any other ever made.

You're not conscious of it at first. Then it dawns on you. An entire scene has been done in the light of a distant street lamp.  The lamp (never seen) is about 50 feet to your left.  Your eyes are drawn to the wrought iron fence outside Scrooge's rather magnificent home.  The camera goes in tight, and the texture of the wrought iron - you know the tiny little waves made by a ball peine hammer on the surface of the metal when it was forged . . . the light from that unseen street lamp, 50 feet distant, is just enough for you to see a glint of yellow on the shiny black metal finish.

This `cinematography' - working at light levels so low, they could never be captured by a digital `film' camera - is repeated in scene after scene.  It makes the sunshine on Scrooge's face, and on Tiny Tim, held aloft on Scrooge's shoulder at movie's end so . . . welcome!  Light has been used (finally!) to underline Scrooge's utter, endless joy (your own too).

I don't know if you, like me, will sit there, tears of joy streaming down your face, watching the closing credits. Only three other people were left in the theatre as the scroll of credits reached its end. (I watched this one with my mentally-handicapped friend ""Michael"" - please see our review of the last `best' Christmas movie ""POLAR EXPRESS"").

A couple and their 14 year old son sitting just ahead of us, delayed their departure, putting on their coats, discreetly so as not to block the view of the only two persons left watching intently. As if to explain my tear-stained face, I said to the woman (an investment counselor as it turns out): ""I have to see who wrote that stirring `carol' --- a (mainly) men's choir led by a truly great tenor.  Sure enough, the music was written by the last great film score composer, Alan Silvestri. He co-wrote all those wondrous songs like ""When Christmas Comes to Town"" for Polar Express; all the great incidental music for ""Forrest Gump"" too!

The couple's son explained how the 3-D glasses work. Oh yes. His mother had opened our conversation saying, ""I actually caught one of those snowflakes"" (felt it in her hand).  Her son said (not convincingly to his Dad) ""the snow looks (better) the closer you are to the screen.""  Together, they noticed that my friend Michael was still wearing his 3-D glasses, while sipping the last of his diet coke.

""Michael,"" I said, ""is from a L'Arche home,"" waiting to see if the term `registered.' ""That's for mentally-handicapped,"" volunteered Michael.  Oh yes, and Michael agreed with me when I said, ""that's the best movie I have ever seen.""

This new version of Dickens' classic marries much of the original prose with the ability to do eye-popping scenes with computer-aided animation.  I waited to see the chestnuts that mark a faithful presentation, beginning with Old Ebenezer's opening interaction with nephew Fred:

SCROOGE:  What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.

FRED:  What right have you to be dismal? You're rich enough.

Dickens' original text is rather faithfully followed, and many scenes that previously relied heavily on the audience's imagination are more than fully fleshed out.  At appropriate times Zemeckis concentrates on important details in a way a stage adaptation could not: Marley's appearance is heralded by a single bell that begins to sway to and fro, then gently clinking, then finally loudly clanging, accompanied by every bell in Scrooge's house.

We know that Scrooge is guided about by the three ghosts - the Ghost of Christmas Past carries him out of London and over snow-covered countryside to the home of his youth.  The Ghost of Christmas Present gives a new take on Scrooge's looks at events taking place: the floor of Scrooge's parlor is rendered invisible and the Ghost magically moves the floor over London - to the Cratchit home, then to the party going on at Fred's.  The Spirit of Yules Yet To Come is ingeniously manifest as only a shadow, taking solid form only when the Spirit needs to point an eery black bony finger at the next ghastly site in Scrooge's future.

But the filmmakers must have been intoxicated with the animated ability to zoom us back and forth.  The trips listed above are interesting and, given the spirit of the tale, appropriate.  I'll even fail to criticize the transition between ""Past"" and ""Present"", a segue that involves Scrooge mounting the cap of Christmas past - a ""hat"" that looks like a stainless steel megaphone.  The cap blasts off towards the moon like the Space Shuttle and we get to see the silhouette of Scrooge flailing across an E.T. inspired broad moon face.

I cannot give a similar pass to another ""chase"" scene - Scrooge is chased halfway across the City by a ghostly hearse pulled by demonic black horses with fiery red eyes.  You remember that scene from Dickens, right?  No doubt you recall that Scrooge escapes by being magically shrunk to six inches and diving into a drain-pipe.  Mini-Scrooge is deposited into the scene where his housekeeper is rifling through his bed curtains - perhaps most distracting, six-inch Ebenezer is given a voice about three octaves above Alvin and the Chipmunk - for the LIFE of me I could scarcely understand a word he squeaked before being chased out of the room with a broom alongside a mouse.

A word must be given in praise of the voice actors: Jim Carrey is frankly magnificent as not only Scrooge, but also as the various spirits.  If you're going to make a Holiday tradition of a Jim Carrey film, choose this one over&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Seuss-How-The-Grinch-Stole-Christmas-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00006AFF5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas (Deluxe Edition)</a>. Gary Oldman brings the male Cratchits and Jacob Marley to life.  You can feel the jolliness Bob Hoskins brought to old Fezziwig, and Colin Firth is perfect as the kind-spirited Fred.

The heart and soul of A Christmas Carol involves Scrooge's transformation from lonely old skinflint to ""and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well"".  Our theatre was full of satisfied customers - but I wish Zemeckis had been slightly MORE inspired by Dickens, and slightly less by George Lucas' mantra of ""movement through the frame.""",1259971200,,4395,5.272596843615495

4159689,4,B003NFM3JK,"I actually liked Robert Zemeckis' new film ""A Christmas Carol"", which surprised me.

A few years ago, Zemeckis began to use and develop his own motion capture technology. Basically, in motion capture, an actor wears a special suit with pinpoints all over it. A special camera films the live actor as they perform and this is transformed into an animated character. This technology allows the filmmakers to create a more human animated character with more fluid movements. The main advance of Zemecki's work seems to be they are able to use this same technique for facial expressions, allowing the characters to be more emotive and responsive to the action going on, The first film using this new technology, ""The Polar Express"" starring Tom Hanks in a number of roles, is a strange film. All of the people in the film look like zombies and have soulless eyes. The second film was ""Beowulf"" and it was a SLIGHT improvement, but not much. Now, we have a new retelling of Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" starring Jim Carrey as Scrooge and a number of other characters. A vast improvement.

There are a couple of things at work, contributing to make this film more enjoyable. In the past few years, the use of Digital 3-D has exploded and it seems particularly suited to animated films. Now, some studios will only release an animated film in 3-D. Why? The premium charged for the 3-D glasses helps the box office. And I don't mind paying the premium either, because this new 3-D technology is heads and shoulders above what we are used to. I decided to see ""A Christmas Carol"" in IMAX 3-D. If I thought regular old Digital 3-D was good, IMAX 3-D is AWESOME. There is a product trailer at the beginning, which makes you feel like you are being transported into the screen. The screen size, enhanced projection and great sound system all work in concert to create an almost immersive experience, exactly what 3-D is trying to accomplish in the first place.

When I initially heard about this film and the use of Zemecki's technique, I as skeptical. I just didn't like ""The Polar Express"" or ""Beowulf"" that much. Why is Zemeckis so enamored of this technology? He can have all of the actors on one completely bare soundstage and transport them to Victorian London. It must save a fortune to not have to physically create all of the sets, props, costumes, etc.

But from the first moment of the new film, you feel as though you are being transported to a new time and place. The book opens and we see the first words of the immortal tale and a line drawing before the drawing becomes the film, dropping us next to Scrooge as he inspects the dead body of Jacob Marley, his longtime business partner.

With each new scene, Zemeckis and his team recreate a different part or aspect of Victorian London and they leave no small detail untouched. Some of the scenes look like paintings, but in a good way, lush, beautiful and evocative of a different time and place. Others look dark and foreboding, scary and haunted. These compositions really seem to come to life and help to make the story seem real and authentic.

There are still some problems with this technology. They seem to have fixed the problem with the eyes, but now the characters have this weird look to the faces. For instance, Colin Firth plays Scrooge's nephew, Fred. Fred looks a lot like Colin Firth, but they have given the character a larger chin, a Jay Leno chin. I guess because Scrooge has the same. But the chin makes his face seem odd. Gary Oldman plays Bob Cratchit and he seems to be a short man, shorter than even Gary Oldman is in real life. To accommodate for this, they have made his head more squashed and round than it is. His face still looks like Gary Oldman, just squashed and round. Each of the characters looks like the actor portraying them, with 'make-up' enhancements, but their faces seem to be stretched onto mannequins, a little like examples of plastic surgery gone bad, like the skin is stretched a little too tight. This and the combination of the odd enhancements make most of the characters seem unpleasantly weird.

Because the filmmakers create the exact look and feel of the characters, one actor can play multiple roles.  Jim Carrey plays Scrooge as an old man and at different times throughout his life and all three Ghosts of Christmas. Carrey does an excellent job and brings Scrooge to life, making him seem like the most despising miser ever. The film opens with Scrooge visiting his recently deceased partner Jacob Marley at the funeral home. Convinced his partner is dead, he pauses the undertaker and quickly takes the coins resting on Marley's eyes. Seven years later, when he returns home on Christmas Eve, he walks through his dark house, reluctant to light lamps. He gives his assistant, Bob Cratchit, a dressing down for merely looking at a new lump of coal as he shivers uncontrollably at his desk in the cold office. But then you probably know all of this already because I have no doubt you have seen at least one version of this story already.

Carrey has already proven he is an adept comedian, willing and able to do just about anything for a laugh. He has also done some good work in more dramatic roles. In ""A Christmas Carol"", he does more dramatic work giving a real depth to Scrooge and all of his personal prejudices against the poor, his family, happiness. At one point, there is an extended chase that feels odd, almost as though it has been included to up the comedy level, to ensure Carrey has access to some slapstick.

I find it odd that Carrey is listed as the actor providing the voice for the Ghost of Christmas Present. In the film, this ghost is represented as a semi-opaque black specter, very scary and very much like you would imagine a ghost to be. But this ghost doesn't have a face and I don't think he utters a single word. What exactly did Carrey do to portray this character? Stand and point?

The Ghost of Christmas Past looks the most like Carrey, like the filmmakers used his face and simply pasted it on a flame. The Ghost of Christmas Present looks like a cross between Santa Claus and Jim Carrey. What I am describing to you probably sounds very familiar, again because you have no doubt seen another version of this same story.

Zemeckis and his team have done a great job of making all of the familiar bits of the book look real and they have adapted the book in a way that seems more faithful. For instance, the Ghost of Christmas Future is a scary specter and would give anyone a fright. It actually might be the scariest representation of the ghost I have ever seen. Marley's Ghost is also pretty terrifying and the darkness, the cavernous of Scrooge's lonely, empty home has been brought to life in a way that most film adaptations couldn't even attempt. Strangely, the spaces don't only look real, they seem to have depth.

The depiction of Victorian London, at Christmastime, is really beautiful. Even the dirty, rundown, awful parts they show look like you would imagine Victorian London to be. But the good parts? These moments are what many of us think Christmas should be like. It really puts you in the spirit for Christmas.

Which makes me wonder why Disney released the film so freaking early? November 9th? I know they didn't want to compete with Avatar for 3-D screens, but releasing the film three weeks before Thanksgiving when people just aren't in the mood yet? If I were Disney I would have switched the release dates of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"". The traditionally animated ""Princess"" would have already transformed the box office. Instead, ""A Christmas Carol""'s box office seems a little miserly.",1259625600,,7695,4.656848306332843

4159693,5,B003NFM3JK,"Over the years I've seen at least a dozen versions of Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"", and this one, dynamic and evocative, ranks among the very best, I saw it in an Imax theater in three D, and the special effects were stunning. The very rapidly moving aerial views of London were spectacular with a beautiful shot of St. Paul's Cathedral. Victorian England came to life because the director had paid attention to detail, authenticity. The wintry, slippery streets of London were part of the atmospherics.
 I was never really aware that Scrooge was being played by Jim Carrey because the make-up and computer effects similar to ""Polar Express"" submerged and camouflaged the person. He did a great job, even better by my lights because I've never been much of a Carrey fan. The sharp jutting chin in the young and old Scrooge reminded me of a character drawn by Toulouse-Lautrec. Scrooge was amazingly thin and emaciated. The three ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future are all played by Carrey though I never realized until I read the credits.
 The movie was fast-paced. I have seen rather stately, pokey versions in the past, but this one zipped along as it concentrated almost entirely on Scrooge. The three visits of the three Christmas ghosts initiated by the dead partner Marley were done with alacrity. Scrooge goes flying off into space like a rocket.
 This film has a comic book or graphic novel look to it with some scenes looking like drawings, paintings that have come to life. There are some funny touches as when Scrooge balks or shows a wise guy side as he talks to the ghosts. You get the essentials of the story, a lot of action and movement, without being bogged down by some of the old familiar stuff. The Roger de Coverley dance in Scrooge's past was well done. Some of the characters in the dance sequence are Pickwickian. Scrooge's stinginess and acquisitiveness are evoked by the stacks of coins on his desk as a young and old man.
 The street scenes were cleverly recreated. Kids were rolling hoops with sticks, sliding down icy hills on their feet which Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) imitates later. Some kids hitched themselves onto the rear of fast-moving wagons and foot-skied behind, and Scrooge does it after his redemption. Of course the theme of the story is how the real spirit of Christmas can bring about redemption.
 It has a truly Dickensian flavor using some of his actual dialogue, description and narration. The Cratchits' prosaic roasted goose inspires Scrooge to send them a turkey.
For kiddies and adults in the audience the story comes alive with added dimensions. This is a reimagined version, done with originality and creativity. It may be too scary for little tots.",1259452800,,2715,4.83010752688172
4159694,5,B003NFM3JK,"I just saw this one in the theater.  I chose the 3-D showing.  You know the famous Charles Dickens' story.  It is the same basic story line, but done in the computer animation that makes the characters look about as close to human as possible, at least for now.  I almost forget they are not real, except the eyes never look quite right.  The computer graphics are phenomenal, the color is beautiful, and the picture is sharp.  If you saw Disney's Polar Express, it is the same animation quality.  It is hard for me to believe this is Jim Carrey.  It doesn't even sound like him.  He does a fantastic job with Scrooge.  I watch the Scrooge story every Christmas season, probably several times.

The story begins on Christmas Eve.  Jacob Marley has died and Scrooge has made arrangements with the undertaker for a nice wooden box.  Scrooge reluctantly pays the undertaker and whisks around to scarf up the tuppences that lay on Marley's eyes, telling a young boy that it is money (and not to be wasted).

The sun is shining brightly outside and the snow is lightly falling, providing a multi-dimensional effect while wearing your 3-D glasses.  Snow falls through most of the picture.  We hear singing and move through the streets of old London, watching the street vendors hulk their wares.  Scrooge moves through the streets, grouching the whole time.  It's what he does best, you know.  As Scrooge enters the storefront marked by the sign ""Scrooge and Marley,""  the ""M"" begins to wiggle.

Fast forward 7 years, to the anniversary of Marley's death.  We find Scrooge and Bob Cratchett working in the cold, cold office on Christmas Eve.  Cratchett is freezing his little buns off but dare not place another chunk of coal on the fire.  As a matter of fact, I think the coal box had a lock on it.  (Heck, one piece of coal is enough.  Who needs feeling in their fingers anyway?)  Nephew Fred stops by to visit Uncle Scrooge and gets the bah humbug routine.  The two gents come in, asking for a donation for charity and Scrooge delivers the famous ""Let them die and decrease the surface population"" line.

Scrooge closes for the evening, reminding Cratchett it is not fair that he be off all day on Christmas, being paid for no work, and he need be there early on December 26!  They part company, Cratchett scurrying to be merry and Scrooge grouching home to be Scrooge.

The fun begins as we see Scrooge's door knocker come alive, glowing with Marley's face!  Scrooge is seriously creeped out, even after he runs upstairs and locks everthing behind him.  As he cowers in his chair, the 4 bells above the inside of his door begin to ring, no BANG--loudly, followed by the entrance of (guess who?) J-A-C-O-B  M-A-R-L-E-Y!

Of course, like I said, you know the story.  The 3 ghosts visit and the computer animations allow for a nice level of visual entertainment as they take Scrooge to the past, present, and the possible future.  Through a mixture of heart-touching rememberances, fear, and compassion, they remind Scrooge that it is NOT all about HIM!  This story is an excellent reminder of the importance of carrying love and compassion and opening your heart to others, for without our heart-centers, we dry up inside.

This is a great rendition of the classic, I don't care how many times you have seen the story before.

Disney done it again! Enjoy!",1259193600,2,3351,4.671232876712328
4159695,5,B003NFM3JK,"Other reviewers have commented on the acting performances of Jim Carrey et al in Disney's new animated (""live action"" performance capture) version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL by Charles Dickens. I'll simply say that Carrey is brilliant in his multiple roles; he's the Scrooge for the Ages.

What I really want to rave about is the visual special FX of this production, especially the 3-D format, which will most assuredly be nominated for an Oscar. The opening sequence, in which the virtual camera soars over and through a marvelously re-created 1842 London, is worth the price of admission alone. My wife and I watched the film from the front row of an invitation-only studio screening. During a couple of scenes depicting falling snow, it seemed, through our 3-D glasses, that we could reach out and touch the descending flakes. And one is tempted to flinch backwards as the blackened, skeletal, claw-hand of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come apparently reaches out from the screen.

It's been decades since I read the Dickens classic. (At least, I think I read it; memory fails.) I suspect that literary purists may object to embellishments of the original story, and over-protective parents may judge it too dark for small children. I say to those, ""Get over it!"" The visuals will simply knock your socks off and I'd award six stars if the rating system allowed such.

You'll thank yourself if you make the decision to go see A CHRISTAMAS CAROL (2009) on the Big Screen. I'll happily go see it a second time, which isn't something I can usually say about an animated feature.",1258848000,2,1574,4.822222222222222
4159696,2,B003NFM3JK,"I don't know how many of you caught The Christmas Carol Train Tour if it came by your city, which promoted this film.  Having experienced that along with Zemeckis' previous two CGI gems (The Polar Express and Beowulf), my wife and I were understandably excited about this.  After watching the film last night in IMAX 3-D, our opinions dropped harder than a rock in my broth.  Here is the dichotomy:

Jim Carrey as Scrooge... Ok, I'm going to lose a lot of people here.  For the record, I think Carrey is fine actor, much better than many give him credit for.  However, like The Grinch, I felt he was miscast.  True, the confines of the character Scrooge greatly limited him to how crazy he can be.  However, since he also played multiple roles here, he was able to space out the energy bursts over several planes.  As Scrooge, he tried to grain his voice to sound like an old man, and it was so painfully artificial.  Also, his dialogue was often delivered in so many sporadic quips and chirps, it got really annoying.  If he was just a supporting actor in the film, I probably could have dismissed him.  However, since he was the main character, it was like a mosquito bite that just wouldn't stop itching.  His incessant laughing as the Ghost of Christmas Present was overboard and overlong.

When Robert Zemeckis mentioned in an interview a few years ago that he felt all movies now should be done totally via CGI, I wanted to cringe.  There is nothing wrong with diverting to this format once in a while, but I am SO glad than most other directors have not adopted this idiotic philosophy.  Each scene in Zemeckis' last two CGI films were meticulously crafted and were crucial to the final product.  Here, however, I felt it needlessly dragged in many spots, especially with an overlong chase scene and the sequence with the Ghost of Christmas Future.

The animation, especially the backdrop detail is truly amazing even getting down to Scrooge's nose-hairs.  However, unlike The Polar Express and Beowulf which had existed before merely as illustrations, Christmas Carol has been done on screen before several times and with a fine ensemble of actors to boot.  The Polar Express and Beowulf were fresh and original cinematic milestones.  This was not.  Having watched Alastair Sim, George C. Scott, and Reginald Owen pour their hearts out in earlier versions, they bring an emotional punch that no CGI character can EVER match.  Also with an over-emphasis on action scenes here, it seemed Zemeckis was sacrificing fluidity for the sake of showing what his computers can do.

Apparently, a lot of people like this film.  So, it looks like I'm a lone wolf here.  However, opinions are like noses.  Everybody's got one, usually with a couple of holes in it.  This one's mine.",1258761600,10,2777,4.741127348643007
4159697,4,B003NFM3JK,"From an artistic viewpoint, the new Robert Zemeckis film from the man who gave us THE POLAR EXPRESS, is another of his animated features using the motion picture capture technique that allows the actors to play several roles--and the cinematography is exceptionally well done.

JIM CARREY, as miserly Ebenizer Scrooge, looks nothing like his real self. He's a perfect Scrooge, using his voice and mannerisms to great effect, never overplaying the role as you might expect he would.

The visit from three spirits is more frightening than usual, since Zemeckis decided to throw everything he could into startling special effects--sometimes with very gruesome results. The sight of Marley's Ghost with a flapping jaw that has to be realigned by Marley is just one of the ""extra"" touches. Some of the ""spirit"" scenes are too intense for small children and more likely to frighten them than anything else.

There are times when the story remains very faithful to the Dickens book, sometimes even word for word. But when Zemeckis decides to show off what the camera can do with flying aerial scenes zooming over Victorian London, it begins to stray a bit. Biggest stray is a chase scene that has a miniature Scrooge going through drain pipes to escape an oncoming coach and horses trying to run him down.

The lovely score by Alan Silvestri blends perfectly with the on screen action and includes a number of traditional Christmas favorites. GARY OLDMAN and COLIN FIRTH do well in key supporting roles but it's really Carey's show all the way. He plays several main characters with great skill.

Not quite as festive as you might expect, it's a darker version of Scrooge, handsomely executed so that many of the scenes look like Victorian illustrations from the novel.

Warning: This is not a child's version of the tale. Parents should be advised that some of the content is too gruesome for young kids. Personally, I enjoyed it and I'm glad I stayed to hear Andreas Boccelli's beautiful voice over the end credits.

4159698,5,B003NFM3JK,I just saw this movie in the theater.  I just loved it.  The animation is so life like.  Now I did see it in 3D which was outstanding and added to the enjoyment of this film.  The story is the original story which I'm sure you've all seen some version of it and it keeps very true to the original.  It was just a feel good movie.  Jim Carrey did a good job as scrooge.  I had tears in my eyes at the end.  I buy about one movie every couple of years and I plan on buying this one so for me that is saying something.,1258502400,2,515,3.7476635514018692
4159709,5,B003NFM3JK,"Walt Disney's Buena Vista Productions and Robert Zemekis's adds twists and turns and ""magic"" to this new depiction of the Charles Dickens classic tale.  Imagine riding one of the dioramas at the theme park and watching Zemekis's perennial Christmas favorite, The Polar Express, one can imagine what to expect from this very imaginative version.

The digital technology and computerized animation spotlight this film.  But in order to experience the special effects, one must absolutely see the IMAX 3-D edition.  The 3-D glasses may be somewhat of an inconvenience, especially for those who wear prescription eyeglasses, but all worth it once viewers see the eye-popping scenes that provide the extravagance, fast-paced, and full-dimensional senses of the entire film, such as the winter snowfall that one can almost imagine touching as well as Ebenezer Scrooge glaring his notorious facial expressions; Jim Carrey does a fine job playing Scrooge as well as the almost unrecognizable Ghost of Christmas Present.  And in addition, there is certainly plenty of fun and frolicking within the film to add the Christmas spirit to one's holiday film viewing, and one scene in particular is where the Ghost of Christmas Past takes Scrooge back to revisit one of the most jubilant periods in his life where jolly old Mr. Fezziwig hosts the Christmas ball filled with music, laughter, and dancing.  And lastly, what would A Christmas Carol be like without the London city streets and their quaint Victorian dcor that adds even more sprinkles of Christmas throughout the film?

Indeed, one can go on and on about the numerous surprises throughout the film and the jaw-dropping scenes.  But after the last credit flickers on the screen, Christmas film aficionados will most likely want to see the film more than once.",1258416000,3,1806,5.18213058419244

""The Polar Express"" has become a Christmas classic to me so I really enjoyed Robert Zemeckis' ""Christmas Carol.""  To me, it was simply magical.  I've always enjoyed the Victorian London films such as ""Gaslight"" or ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" with the fog, snow, & gaslit streets.  This is really as if you're experiencing the story yourself with Scrooge.  You're transported into the story & to me, that's what makes this film special.  It's the best 3-D movie ever!

I saw Disney's A Christmas Carol in 3D at my local IMAX theatre and was swept away both visually and emotionally by the film.  The animation is wonderful, the cast was wonderful and the music was wonderful... Andrea Bocelli did a song for this movie that was absolutely beautiful.

I've always been partial to the 1930's version of A Christmas Carol but Disney's version is right on par with the earlier one.  The movie kept to it's classic roots and had just enough ""Disney Essence"" to make it fun and emotionally fulfilling.  Go see this... You won't be disappointed!",1258156800,,718,4.712
4159712,5,B003NFM3JK,"I love this story and have taught it in my English classes so I am very familiar with it.  There have been many versions but I have to admit I am a bit picky about the ones I really like.  I will add this to the list of the versions I will watch again and again.

The story stuck very closely to the book, using the same dialogue in most cases.  Nothing is lost in the story.  The characters were designed as they described in the book, which is not often the case.  The details in the homes, offices and in the city were magnificent.  It was almost like getting a history lesson in the bargain.  The movie did not hesitate to include the hunger and starvation that were a part of London in the mid-19th century.  There was a bit of comedy but it is not really a comedic book so it was kept to a minimum.  A few details were added to accommodate the 3-D but they fit in well with the movie.  Nothing vital was taken out and nothing unnecessary was added

The animation was wonderful.  The details were minute, even down the wind-chaffed red cheeks and noses of the Londoners.  At one point I could see the pores on Scrooge's nose.  I saw this movie in 3-D and I highly recommend it.  I see this as the future of movies, the effect was fantastic.  I am not a fan of Jim Carey but he did a good job in this rather than going over the top as he often does.

Highly, highly recommended although parts of the movie might be a little scary for very young children.",1258070400,,1458,4.128113879003559

(I really felt like I was roaming the streets of old London.)  I loved how they incorporated ""Hark The Herald Angels Sing"" into the movie.  I loved how faithful the movie was to the Dickens classic.  Arguably the best adaptation of A Christmas Carol.  Go see it.  Highly recommended.",1257897600,,581,4.617647058823529

Everything about A Christmas Carol, the performances, computer imagery, music, interpretation of Dicken's story is astounding.  I have seen and own all the associated films, with the exception of the 1908 version; but Zemckis' film is by far the best, because it remains true to Charles Dicken's original story. Not only is this a true companion to Dicken's story, but it also allows the viewer to see and understand the world in which the author lived and wrote.  It is not just Christmas entertainment, but an experience beyond our own.",1257897600,,589,4.87
4159715,4,B003NFM3JK,"I was worried when I learned Jim Carrey would star in Disney's production of ""A Christmas Carol"". There has never been a more perfect holiday tale and I was concerned about the possibility of an over-the-top Carrey performance. As it turns out, Jim Carrey was wonderful...HOWEVER, since seeing the movie I'm wondering what the developers of the project were thinking? The first fifteen minutes of the film had me believing I was viewing a version  that would join the Alastair Sim and George C. Scott versions in the holiday classics hall-of-fame. However, as the film continued the purity of Dickens' story was compromised with chase scenes and a shrinking Ebenezer Scrooge. Come on!! The screen time could have been better used telling the complete story and developing the other major characters...Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, his nephew Fred and Belle. These characters were crucial to Scrooge's reclamation and their importance were, for the most part, trivialized. There were stellar moments...for example, the visitation by Marley's ghost and the scene in the Cratchit home after Tiny Tim's death, but they were too few and far between. Visually the film was absolutely stunning! Some of the ""special effects"" were wonderful...others just didn't fit the story. The problem with the film, I believe, is that the target audience was not well defined. It appeared at times to target an adult audience and then it would abruptly shift to some rediculous scene clearly intended to satisfy children. If I had wanted to see a children's version I would have rented ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" or ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"". The film is basically true to Dickens' marvelous story but is, at best, a ghostly apparition (pun intended) of the original...it just didn't have enough substance. Entertaining? Yes. Worthwhile seeing? Yes, particularing at an IMAX theater. But if you love Charles Dickens' masterpiece, be prepared to set your expectations a little lower.",1257724800,3,1957,5.212698412698413
4159716,4,B003NFM3JK,"Ever since it was first published in 1843, Charles Dickens' tale of miserly Scrooge and his redemption at the hands of various ghosts has long entranced readers with its message of holiday cheer.  It has been adapted numerous times for both stage and screen with a wide variety of distinguished actors such as Alistair Sim and George C. Scott taking on the Scrooge role.  This time, director Robert Zemeckis takes on the familiar story with the help of 3-D motion capture animation and the rubber-limbed talents of Jim Carrey.  What emerges is a flick that, despite its tendency to overuse the 3-D tricks of the trade, is a very faithful adaptation of the Dickens' work in both mood and detail.  In an unusual twist, Carrey not only tackles the role of miserly Scrooge in all his incarnations, but also the roles of all three of the Christmas Spirits who haunt him.  To his credit, Carrey chooses to underplay the miser, making him more believable as a result. He's also very effective in his interpretations of Christmas Past and Yet to Come, with only Christmas Present displaying any hint of his usual penchant to overact.  Carrey is also given solid support by Gary Oldman as Marley's Ghost and Bob Cratchit, Bob Hoskins' Fezziwig and Old Joe, and Robin Wright Penn's Belle and Fan.  Colin Firth provides a nice contrast to Carrey in his role of Fred, Scrooge's nephew.

Zemeckis presents a handsome production that faithfully recreates Victorian London, supported by a wonderful soundtrack by Alan Silvestri.  Zemeckis' screenplay also does justice to the tale by presenting many of the darker themes that tend to get ignored in many other adaptations.  Indeed, it should be noted that some of the images might be considered too strong for very young audiences.  Overall, this film proves to be a delightfully strong entry into the list of worthy CAROL adaptations and definitely worth seeing.",1257638400,,1898,4.918495297805642
4159717,5,B003NFM3JK,"A stooped and crooked curmudgeon walks the streets of Olde London Towne, scaring off beggars, bedraggled but merry carolers, the well-meaning businessmen trying to provide a bit of charity, and in general, anyone who dares to make merry in his presence, including his nephew Fred (voice by Colin Firth).  That old man is Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) the sole remaining partner of the countinghouse of Scrooge and Marley. And, it's Christmas Eve, the seventh anniversary of Marley's death.

Having decried his faithful clark, Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) for 'robbing him' when he wants the entire day of Christmas off, Scrooge limps his way home to a solitary dinner. Little does he know his former partner, Jacob Marley (voiced by Gary Oldman) is coming in spirit to visit him and offer him one last chance at redemption.  Three ghosts will visit him this Christmas Eve night--if he doesn't accept them, he could end up with a fate as bad as Marley's.

""Christmas Carol"" is for the most part faithful to the Dickensian classic.  Robert Zemeckis has, of course, added some heart-breaking and fearsome twists to the three manifestations of Christmasses Past, Present and Future. He's also given Scrooge almost the face I envisioned when I first read the story many years ago.  He's a hawk-nosed, hard eyed, bitter pill of an old man who looks like he's 'stewed in his own bitter pudding' for many years. Carrey's performance is spot-on with just the right hints of humor to keep the film from getting too bleak. London is lovingly rendered in white show and industrial ash, a mix of prosperity and poverty of which Charles Dickens would have recognized and approved as a landscape for his story.  The feel of the place is so real I wanted a bowl of hot soup to warm me after.  The final glory and benediction was Andreas Boccelli singing ""God Bless us Everyone.""

This film's going to be a classic for years to come. I'm definitely purchasing the Blu Ray as soon as the disk becomes available.  One caution:  though this film is by Disney, it is not for very young children.  Some of the ghostly images scared the younger kids in the audience.

  I expected Jim Carrey to be extremely annoying voicing Scrooge, as well as playing the 3 spirits. He's pretty restrained though and that's good since he gives his best performances when he's not over-acting. Zemeckis is good at making this kind of movie but he's too good to just make animated movies. I'm hoping that his next is a live action film. I mean, this is the guy that made Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Romancing the Stone and Forrest Gump.
