2777342,3,B000NQ28IS,"I really like Don Frieson, he is hilarious. But I had already purchased his 'Ask Your Mom' stand up video before purchasing this one. So you can understand my disappointment when this one turned out to be almost all of the exact same jokes, except from 2009 and with a slightly crapper sound system. The order of the jokes is a little different...and there were a few 'mini jokes' and comments tossed in along the way that didn't happen in the 2012 video. But for the post part...it was a less polished version of the same thing. Making this pretty much a waste of money if you have already purchased and watched the latter. Why they have different names and are selling them on here as if they are two completely different videos...I am not sure. More money on the same material perhaps?",1375574400,5,788,4.5174825174825175
2777343,5,B000NQ28IS,Love Don; he's unique & funny!  Plus it's clean (no bad language); which makes it even better!  Definitely laughed my butt off!,1357084800,,127,4.7272727272727275
2777344,5,B000NQ28IS,This man is so funny.  I watch his Prozac Pilot skit from time to time when I need a laugh.  An iconic comedy skit.  Should go down in the Hall of Fame.  Price of the DVD is worth it just for that skit alone.,1349740800,,208,3.659090909090909
2777345,5,B000NQ28IS,"Sometimes comedians are funnier in ""audio only"", like how I discovered Don Friesen on Sirius Satellite radio.
I find his humor to be very funny- and ""spot-on"", and this video is a good delivery agent.
My favorite section is where he describes his youth riding in the back of his Dad's pickup.  Will crack you up.",1344384000,,312,4.571428571428571
2777346,5,B000NQ28IS,"Just as expected, funny, clean family friendly. Than you Don Friesen for doing comedy I can enjoy with my 14 year old grandson.",1272153600,,127,4.565217391304348
2777347,5,B000NQ28IS,"INEXPLICABLE is a terrific comedy concert DVD!  Don Friesen, the comedian who tries to ""explic"" things to us, has developed an incredibly funny, relatible act that bears multiple viewings.  Friesen excels as a verbal AND physical comedian, as well as does several dead-on impersonations - including George, Jerry, and Kramer in his own episode of SEINFELD.

His subject matter - finding self-depricating humor in the everyday experience and taking it to the furthest degree - recalls not only the work of Seinfeld himself, but also the great Bill Cosby.  It's hilarious stuff, delivered with a precision and assurance not equaled by most of the current crop of stand-up comedians.

Another facet of Friesen's work is that it's fairly general-audience friendly - meaning he does hit a few PG-13 subjects now and again but does keep everything pretty clean.  Not that comedy always has to be or even SHOULD always be ""clean"", but those of you out there who may be sensitive to more risque' material need not worry.  Another thing the comedian has in common with Cosby.",1189728000,2,1066,4.988700564971752
2777348,5,B000NQ28IS,"Don Friesen's ""Inexplicable"" is VERY explicable.  Allow me to ""explic"" it to you.  First off, Don Friesen is a bona fide superstar comic who belongs at the top with all the great comics of today.  His comedy is wide ranging and far reaching--and it's all clean!  His impressions are spot-on and his physical comedy is AMAZING and superb.  He has many impressions and a ton of physical humor.  Oh yeah, most importantly, his bits and jokes are fall-down funny!!!  He has a sketch comedy feel to his act.  His self-deprecating humor sucks you in and never lets you go.  You laugh with him and at yourself because you can relate to a lot of his life experiences.  The Prozac Pilot and Wussman Walking are classic and laugh-out-loud hilarious!  And don't blink, or you'll miss the joke in The Matrix mode.  Buy it now and be one of the first to be able to say that you were a true fan before the rest of the world catches on and makes him a household name and superstar!!!  As Seinfeld would say, Don Friesen is ""gold baby, gold""!",1174780800,,1026,4.451612903225806
8180592,3,B000NQ28IS,"His newer comedy special, ""Go ask your Mom"" is hilarious.  I was expecting the same with this one but, it's just ok.",1504310400,,116,4.2727272727272725
8180593,5,B000NQ28IS,Funny and clean. Hard to find these days,1468108800,,40,4.125
8180594,4,B000NQ28IS,Very entertaining and clean!,1458000000,,28,6.25
8180595,5,B000NQ28IS,"This guy is very funny and a real pro. As impressive, he works clean and that's rare today when a lot of comics think the use of four letter words and graphic body part language is ""cutting edge"" but is really just a cheap shortcut.",1429574400,,232,4.177777777777778
8180596,3,B000NQ28IS,mostly funny,1418256000,,12,5.5
8180597,1,B000NQ28IS,"Absolutely dreadful.  About as unfunny as one can get.  HOWEVER, this IDENTICAL material is re-done in ""Ask Your Mom"" (on Netflix) which was absolutely hysterical.  Maybe Don just had more polish by the time he did ""Ask Your Mom.""  I put this one in the sellback bag and bought ""Ask Your Mom"" for my ""keeper"" collection.

Don't give up on Don.  I've watched ""Ask Your Mom"" probably 10 times and absolutely crack up every time.  Just skip the original version, which is this DVD.",1416441600,,478,4.619047619047619
8180598,3,B000NQ28IS,mostly repeats of his other dvd.,1415923200,,32,4.5
8180599,5,B000NQ28IS,"We watched this video after watching ""Ask Your Mom"", and unfortunately, it was almost exactly the same, but the reason I'm rating this 5 stars is because this video has some outrageous footage that the the other video doesn't have.  If I would have know, I would have just bought this one instead.",1390348800,,297,4.60377358490566
8180600,3,B000NQ28IS,"I didn't realize the material in this video would be the same as ""Go ask you mom"" or I would not have bought it. His act is much more polished in the latter.",1389484800,3,157,3.787878787878788
8180601,2,B000NQ28IS,"This video contains much of the same content as his newer one titled ""Don Friesen - Ask Your Mom""; however, the new one does have new material and the delivery is MUCH better.  I recommend Ask Your Mom ten-fold over this one.",1375747200,4,225,4.357142857142857
