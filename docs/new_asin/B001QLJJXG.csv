8335966,3,B001QLJJXG,I rated this movie so that I can ask those of you who watched this version. I have it on a disk with English dubbing & Dutch subtitles. I want to watch it in German with English subtitles. Format is not an obstacle. Can I do this with this BD version? I would greatly appreciate it if one of you would respond to my inquiry.,1510012800,,324,4.0
8335967,1,B001QLJJXG,"I have a very expensive Sony ""state of the art"" region free bluray/dvd player. The player will play any DVD or BluRay made from any region world wide. It won't play this film though. Other people I know with ""region-free"" players have had similar problems. Had tney known the film was jinxed  they would have never ordered it.",1434412800,,326,4.620689655172414
8335968,4,B001QLJJXG,"If you liked the 7th and 8th installments of the Harry Potter stories you will enjoy this film.  It takes places in the first part of the 17th Century after one of many wars in Europe has ended and multitudes of orphans are roaming all over the face of Europe.  Krabat (David Kross -The Reader) is  one of these orphans who is enticed by a voice to come to a mill where  he becomes the 12th desciple of Meister who is a sorcerer of the dark persuasion.  He is made to feel part of the group.  The only problem is that the sorcerer ages as the year ages and to be renewed, one of the desciples has to be sacrificed. This is not a fast action film with lots of special effects.  It is a well played with an interesting story line that runs at an even pace with good effects and good acting.",1424995200,,788,4.077922077922078

8335970,5,B001QLJJXG,"Unfortunately, although the book was extremely captivating, I never really got to see the film on DVD.  The advertising had a red band across the top of the box informing the buyer that it was from the ""Hollywood Collection"" (there was no region mentioned at all) and thus one was misled into thinking that this DVD is for Region 1 when in reality it is for Region 2.  The latter is for European TVs, whilst the former is exclusively for the USA.  A Region 2 DVD will not play on a Region 1 DVD player.  I have seen the previews on the Internet and they present the same images that come to mind whilst reading the book.  My whistle was wet so to speak.  Be that as it may, I had to return this item with much regret because it failed to operate in my Region 1 DVD player.  I even wrote to one of the actors, fan sites in the hope of knowing when this DVD would be available on the American market, but no response was made.",1350864000,4,924,4.128491620111732
8335971,4,B001QLJJXG,"Krabat is a film that is essentially one of those `Fairy tales' that you use to make children do as they are told; well it is and it isn't, but it is rather good. It starts with our eponymous hero being born into an unforgiving world during the Thirty Years war that ravaged Germany, it is 1646 and Krabat has lost his family to war and famine and is now eeking a survival begging from hovel to hovel with his only two surviving friends and trying to avoid catching a nasty bout of plague. They have all three, made a pact to stay together for ever and ever and ever. Then he has a dream that tells him good things await him at a mysterious mill. So after giving it quite literally minutes of consideration, he does a runner and finds himself at `The Satanic Mill'.

On arrival he is greeted by a one eyed scary bloke who tells him `never leave the mill and always do as you are told'. He meets the lead Journeyman played rather well by Daniel Bruhl (Germanys marmite actor - that is you either love him or hate him, he is good in this though). He then finds he is one of twelve boys/young men, who all do the Masters bidding, and often have to grind strange things that come in heavy sacks during a full moon.

As I said earlier this is a fairy tale, it soon transpires all is not as it seems, but Krabat (David Kross) soon finds out that like American Express, Membership has its' privileges'! The film is beautifully shot and brilliantly acted; it also has a great supporting cast including two of my favourite German actors Robert Stadlober (Lyschko) and Hanno Koffler - the stammering Juro (both were in `Summer Storm'). There is a love interest and lots of sorcery and magic. Whilst there is some CGI it is done so well that you either don't notice or are happy to accept the illusion.

It is a two hour film but feels way shorter director and co writer Marco Kreuzpaintner is to be commended on originality and a great piece of film making. Whilst this is not the best film ever made, it is certainly one of the best in this fantasy, historical fairy tale genre (if one exists). I found it totally engrossing and can not wait to see it again as there was so much going on, I must have missed something. I can only recommend, it is in German with excellent sub titles.",1319760000,2,2274,4.308411214953271
8335972,5,B001QLJJXG,This is a brilliant film and needs to become available on DVD in the US so more people can appreciate it.  I saw it in a rare screening in the US and it is well worth checking out.  Sort of like a dark Grimms fairy tale crossed with Harry Potter and the Dark Ages.  It is beautifully adapted from the very badly named (in the us) THE SATANIC MILL.,1294185600,6,347,4.0
8335973,4,B001QLJJXG,"I viewed this movie at a European film festival and was blown away by the story and the imagery. The movie is dark and mysterious and transports the viewer into the world of this young man; Krabat. He is seduced into a life of secrets and sorcery. It is no surprize since his old life consists of death and poverty. He is then offered shelter by an old mill keeper and all he has to do is work hard. He carries with him his mother's crucifix . When it is found, krabat is told to destroy it. He buries it not wanting to lose the last momento of his dead mother. He befriends one of the young men in the mill only to be warned that things are not as they seem and danger looms. He later realizes that this life is not so wonderful. He may just be a tool used by his new master.

The cinematograpjy is wonderful and adds to the darkness of the story. This  emphasizes the luminous aspects. There is a sort of fairy tale quality that has the viewer wanting the the Krabat to get away from the mill and living happily ever after.  One realizes soon enough that this is no fairy tale and that Krabat may be buried deeper in this life than one suspects. One can't help but feel the elation, the hopelessness and the danger that Krabat experiences. Love it!",1288569600,,1250,4.2
