6256161,4,B00IBIIQTU,"""The Invisible Woman"" (2013 release; 111 min.) brings the story of how famous writer Charles Dickens falls in love with a much younger woman, Ellen ""Nelly"" Ternan"". As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Margrave, 1883"", where we see Ellen and her husband George hang out with several family friends, Ellen is asked (as apparently happens often) about her ""childhood"" (which we later learn is really a misnomer) memories of Charles Dickens. The movie then goes to ""Manchester, some years back"" (in fact, the late 1850s), where we get to know Dickens (played by Ralph Fiennes) as he is trying to turn his book ""The Frozen Deep"" into a stage play. Then comes about the Ternan clan, mother and her 3 daughters, to act in the play. One of the daughters, Ellen (""Nelly""), only 18 at the time, gains the immediate attention of Dickens (a married man, and 20+ years her senior), and a slowly developing courtship starts to play out. What will become of the attraction between these two in a Victorian society where the rules are strict? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is a tour de force for Ralph Fiennes who in addition to starring also directed this movie, his debut as a director. His portrayal of Charles Dickens brims with energy. It is amazing to see how successful Dickens was in his day, truly getting the rock star treatment of that era. Second, the performance of Felicity Jones as Ellen oozes charm from start to finish. She is a veteran of the UK film and TV industry but not so well known on this side of the Atlantic. I think that is likely to change following this performance. Third, the production itself is done exquisitely and hence it is no surprise that this movie just scored an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design. Last but not least, the movie does a great job bringing the dilemma between the feelings of the two protagonists on the one hand, and the demands/standards imposed by society on the other hand. At one point, Dickens asks Nelly to share a secret with him, and she informs him that her middle name is ""Lawless"". When she in turns asks for a secret from Dickens, he whispers ""Ellen Lawless Ternan... that is my secret"", wow.

I saw this movie in late January at the Regal South Beach in Miami, and even though I saw it at a weekday matinee screening, the screening was quite well attended (leaning heavily towards women, I might add). It may be there there is a strong demand for this movie, which is great, as this is certainly a movie that deserves to be seen. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for something that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, and learn a thing or two about Charles Dickens along the way, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray. ""The Invisible Woman"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1393891200,57,2910,4.562141491395794
6256162,4,B00IBIIQTU,"The sorrow and pain of romantic obsession are front and center in ""The Invisible Woman,"" Ralph Fiennes' opulently somber drama about a little-known chapter of the life of Charles Dickens. Based on the biography by Claire Tomalin, ""The Invisible Woman"" is the story of the middle-aged Dickens (Fiennes), by then the most famous and beloved novelist in the world, becoming obsessed with Nelly Ternan (Felicity Jones), a teenage actress in a play Dickens directs and stars in. Dickens presses his suit to Nelly, who at first is unsure of her feelings for Dickens, despite her enormous admiration for him as a writer. Dickens, meanwhile, begins acting like a madman in his passion for Nelly, deserting his wife and ordering his family and friends to accept Nelly or else.

The combination of Victorian hypocrisy and illicit love hangs over the movie like a fog, so that it is a singularly claustrophobic viewing experience. However, the excellence of the performances--Fiennes, Jones, and Kristin Scott Thomas as Nelly's mother--makes the film worthwhile, as do the beautiful costumes and sets. In the end, ""The Invisible Woman"" is the story of a powerful man driven to remake the world around him in his image, and of a young woman left in the end to find a life and identity for herself. it is a rich, complex, and--yes--novelistic story.",1393804800,46,1336,4.99103139013453

6256190,4,B00IBIIQTU,I enjoyed this film very much. The acting was good and it showed a little known aspect of the life of Charles Dickens and the culture in which he lived. Ralph Fiennes was a dead ringer for Dickens. I think my enjoyment was enhanced by having read the well-researched book by Claire Tomalin which included fascinating information about the theater scene in Victorian England and the situation of women working on the stage circuit. Having that background knowledge gives the film depth that I think it lacks in its own.,1476230400,,518,4.766666666666667
6256191,5,B00IBIIQTU,"Fiennes never disappoints as an actor but I must admit I was surprised at Fiennes superb directing and how he captured Dickens' character in so many ways....the readings (which are legendary), the little plays, the story about her....which has only become common knowledge in the past 25 years or so.  I can see how it would look that he was being cruel to his wife....but I can also see that facing the truth is important as well.  They had nothing in common at all except the children.  Times were so different then. The generosity he had from his impoverished childhood.  It was all there. Jones surprised me. The only thing I had seen her is was the rather underrated Hysteria (which was hysterical) and in which she played what I considered to be the boring sister.",1474502400,,770,4.639705882352941

If you love the chamber movies, where the custom designs and arresting landscapes will become another personage, you'll love this one. Fiennes' directorial debut is very interesting.

6256204,5,B00IBIIQTU,Good movie,1450224000,,10,4.5
6256205,5,B00IBIIQTU,"I agree with J.M Fitzpatrick. I thought the movie was exquisite both visually as well as expressively through the acting. I did not see the actress as a 'sourpuss' at all, as one reviewer mentioned. I saw subtleties in her expressions that I am afraid he must have missed. I noted a sense of emptiness we see both between the couple and in the character of Dickens' once the passion is ""spent."" Empty Silence on the part of Ellen is there again after the baby is stillborn and they 'have to' move out of the house where they stayed for a time before the baby was to arrive. That is just one level of meaning that I enjoyed discovering. There is some subtle hint of the sexual relationship which is to come with the couple when Mr. Dickens is out playing with his children during the picnic party.

The movie ultimately speaks to the value of a confession to a spiritual person or clergy in order to find forgiveness, renewal and healing which she needed. It seemed to me that Mr. Fiennes was able to express through non verbal expressions, what I read as an amalgam of attraction, regret and guilt as well as his own ultimate aloneness and emptiness. I think that there is much to explore about the silence and about what was not said by the characters. The script has ""Nellie"" state that she ""has nothing."" To Nellie, being married is what gives a woman ""something."" which is in keeping with how most women truly feel no matter what they may say these days. I think this is a poignant commentary on the true nature of being a woman who is involved in an affair with a married man and unmarried herself. I have known a situation or two where the woman gained almost nothing from her participation in an affair. And This movie is about far more than just trading in an old model for a new one.",1448236800,3,1792,4.397590361445783

We agreed this film feels so authentic,it was as if we were peering through a keyhole into the past-observing people's private lives...no one could be caught ""acting"". The script is beautifully written-Charles Dickens was a ""rock star"" in his day and the film shows the perks and the consequences. However the story centers around the young girl who became his mistress--the consquences for her and the wife he abandoned while maintaining his upright public profile. Felicity Jones is flawless in her portrayl of Nelly,the young woman who was forced by the mores of her day to live her life in secret. If you like special effects and nonstop action-this is not the film for you. However, if you enjoy the films of Luchino Visconti and David Lean,then you will love this one! It is filmed at the speed of life, giving the characters time to think and react just as we do in real situations. I could not detect a false note or a single weak link in this film....I don't think it will get much attention but to my mind it is a masterpiece.",1422144000,7,1356,4.725738396624473

6256239,3,B00IBIIQTU,"Yes, it's a clichebut with ""The Invisible Woman"" it's true. Claire Tomalin's nonfiction account of Charles Dickens' affair with actress Ellen Ternan is far better than this movie. It's not just that the film oversimplifies the story (that's inevitable, when you take a story so complex and turn it into a movie of this length), but that it drags. In fairness, you have to have a whole collection of people with world-class talent to make scenes that consist mostly of silent, meaningful looks and pregnant conversational pauses riveting. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas try hard, but in the end ""The Invisible Woman"" comes off as a stiff costume drama that never feels fully involving.

There are scenes that do work beautifully, though. Joanna Scanlan, as Charles Dickens' dowdy wife Catherine, is absolutely convincing. For me she was the heart of the movie, and walked off with every scene she was in. When she is ordered by Dickens to give Nelly a bracelet that was accidentally delivered to Catherine instead, you can watch her heart break. Tom Hollander is also great as Wilkie CollinsI wanted to see more of him.

Fiennes and Thomas are good as well, but they have a larger boulder to keep pushing uphill. They have to hint, suggest, and hesitate so much that their performances start to feel one-dimensional. I admire the determination to be true to the Victorian period, but it's possible to do that without stalling the action so often.

6256248,3,B00IBIIQTU,"The Invisible Woman is about an affair that Charles Dickens had late in his life with a young actress named Ellen Ternan. Many years younger than Charles, she was 18 and he was 45 when they met. Charles made the decision to separate from his wife Catherine and spent the rest of his life with Ellen.

The film begins with Ellen in middle age reflecting back on her youth as a member of a troupe of actresses hired to perform in a stage play at Charles Dickens' home. Charles is immediately attracted to Ellen, and she's enamored of him as she's read all of his books and thinks highly of him as a writer and person. His wife is portrayed wonderfully by the actress Joanna Scanlan. It's impossible not to be moved by her performance and unhappy circumstances. Charles begins to pursue Ellen, winning her over in time. Her pregnancy is portrayed as well as her sadness when she loses the baby in infancy. Ultimately Charles purchases a home for her and promises to visit once or twice weekly. After his death she marries a much younger man and starts a family.

Directed by Ralph Fiennes, this film is very atmospheric and has very fine acting, including Fiennes as Charles Dickens himself, and Kristin Scott Thomas as Ellen's mother. It is, however, very slow moving and dark and I found it a little bit tedious at times. Checking Rotten Tomatoes I see that critics gave the movie a 76% positive rating, but viewers only gave it a 46% positive rating. I'm not sorry that I watched it, because I have more insight into Dickens than I had before, and as I already mentioned the acting is really very strong, but I can't really give it a strong recommendation either.",1407110400,6,1663,4.558528428093646

6256254,4,B00IBIIQTU,"""Nelly, there are whispers!""  And that's what this film is: a series of heart-breaking, romantic whispers from the past.  The truth about one of our greatest writer's private life.  He followed his heart and broke the hearts of many.  In grasping for a deep love, he alienated those who loved him.  And fate repaid him with a tragedy very few people overcome.

Twists both cruel and emotional abound in this film, but the pace is slow.  SLOW.

The acting is superb.  You really have to enjoy the subtle interactions of characters, deft facial expressions, and meaning in the tone of voice.

Nelly and Dickens' love is stiff, (that's what she said), passionate, plagued by secrecy, and yet meant to be.  ""If only"" seems to be the heartbreaking theme of this relationship.  Dickens and Nelly's love bears a torturous set of parameters.  If you are a romance lover, you have to see this.

The film is not doused with a useless soundtrack.  Instead, ambient setting sounds and sparse bits of music that reflect the scenes' happenings well.  Piano, violin, oboe, etc.  Very PBS.  Touching and appropriate.

Settings are beautiful, dark, accurate.  Dialogue is meaningful, foreshadowing, foreboding.  The plot is infused with Dickens' writings.  Very well-done.

Sometimes the truth is better than fiction.  Watch it.

You might say Dickens is an overly appropriate name for this man after watching this.  But you cannot deny his passion.",1406160000,3,1432,5.012820512820513

Ralph Fiennes has never been finer - perfectly cast in both appearance and actions. I've been studying Dickens for a while, having recently completed several Dickens book courses at Stanford University, and Fiennes totally nails the role. The constant note taking, the long walks, the constant attention-seeking, the moodiness - it's all classic Dickens.

Felicity Jones is also a lovely casting choice for the young paramour with whom Dickens became obsessed. It's a well known story - how Dickens threw over Catherine, the wife of 21 years, with whom he had 10 children. Dickens was 45 and Ternan 18 when he made the decision, which went strongly against Victorian convention, to separate from his wife, Catherine, in 1858--divorce was still unthinkable for someone as famous as he was.

Dickens then sets up Ellen Ternan in a series of homes so that she could appear to be a married woman. They both knew that their choice to live in sin would be scorned by society, but they seemed unable to make any other decision. What doesn't make sense in this film, given how lively Dickens was known to be (he was after all a super star in his time), was the somber mood, dark colors and dreariness of the second half of the film. There must have been some joy in the nearly 13 years they spent together, but it wasn't particularly evident in the film.

6256263,4,B00IBIIQTU,"For his sophomore directing feature, Ralph Fiennes turns to history yet again as he brings the story of Charles Dickens' affair with Ellen Ternan to the screen. Ralph Fiennes himself plays Dickens, while Felicity Jones plays Ellen Ternan and Kristin Scott Thomas plays Elllen's mother, Frances. For me, this film works on just about every level. You have an emotionally involving story and  elegantly composed images that, when put together, produce a sumptuous period drama. Fiennes gives a terrific, nuanced performance as Dickens and, while not completely likable in some respects, is still quite sympathetic despite his contemptuous treatment of his wife. However, the film belongs to Felicity Jones who gives a deeply emotional and conflicted performance as a woman caught between her own personal dignity, and the feelings she has for a married man. Kristin Scott Thomas also does a fine job portraying the mother, who somewhat reluctantly allows Dickens to ""help"" her daughter along. I also greatly enjoyed the way this film was photographed. Whether it was captured on digital or film, I don't know, but whatever they did works. There was a very naturalistic look to the film, and a lot of the scenes with natural lighting reminded me of BARRY LYNDON. I also thought the score did a very good job of conveying a sense of unease, chaos and raw emotion that really complemented the film. Overall, while not a purely pleasant experience, I thought this film was very effective and told a story which should resonate with viewers. The only minor complaint I have is that, at first, the movie drifts between two different time periods without really announcing itself. However, I got used to it after a while. So, I can heartily recommend this to anyone, particularly fans of period drama.",1404604800,3,1792,5.033670033670034

I enjoyed the film.  It's beautifully shot, the acting, especially the performance of Fiennes, is wonderful.  The story, which is apparently factual, is intriguing.

The invisible woman in the film is Nelly Ternan, who had an affair with Dickens from the time she was a teenager and he, a middle aged man, until his death.  Due to the fact that he was married with 10 children and had a huge reputation for family values he kept the affair secret and Ternan was kept in various houses out of the public eye. After Dickens' death she married a schoolmaster and had a child and assumed the role of a proper woman.  Her husband was aware of the fact that she had known Dickens but she cut ten years off of her age, which made her just a child at the time.  The problem I had with the film was that much of this back story, which perhaps the English film viewing public would know, was not explained.  It was only after seeing the film and coming to this website that the missing information was aupplied, which made sense of the story to me. The film opens with Ternan in her later life and then gives us flash backs to her youth when she had the affair with Dickens.

The other problem I had was the misery/joy ratio was weighted too heavy in the direction of misery.  Obviously there must have been a great deal of love and joy in this affair but the film shows us very little of the good times. We don't even see much romance. We see Nelly's angst as she's faced with the decision of whether to accept Dickens' offer of being his mistress, and we see the anguish in her later life as she haunts the beaches where they once walked, obviously obsessed with his memory. Obviously, from her despair in her later life, she must have been  deeply in love with him, and he with her, but we don't see much of that.  Felicity Jones, as Ternan seems to wear one expression for most of the film, a mask hiding either her anxiety or her despair.  It doesn't endear her to the viewer and indeed Dickens, who was the scoundral, comes across as a much more sympathetic character, just because we see his joie de vivre.

The issue of having Ternan come to terms with her misery by revealing her hidden past to the clergyman which then frees her to be happy with her present life, makes for a convenient structure for the film but it struck me as oretty unrealistic. She goes suddenly from a pale, haunted looking creature to the picture of rosy happiness.

In short, the film is a little flawed but it is  still worth watching, for the insight into Dickens personal life and for  Fiennes' brilliant performance..",1404518400,2,2629,4.43035343035343

I'm usually a sucker for these Victorian era dramas.  And here we have one of our best actors, Ralph Fiennes, doubling up as director.  In addition, I've been a fan of Felicity Jones since seeing her in a little seen movie called ""Like Crazy.""  Fiennes plays Charles Dickens who falls for the young Nelly (Jones), an aspiring stage actress.  Dickens, already married with children, struggles with the adulteress relationship.  Even after he separates from his wife (Joanna Scanlan), he insists that his relationship be kept from the public.

Fiennes portrayal of Dickens is infectious as he is a champion of the people.  Perhaps the most famous non-royal in London.  Ms. Jones is equally remarkable.  On guard early on from falling for the older author she admires, Nelly eventually acquiesces to the role of a kept woman with her own house provided by Dickens, but is often lonely and forlorn.  The story is actually shown in flashback as the older Nelly has married and has a child.  Her previous relationship with the now deceased Dickens is a well-kept secret.  So back and forth the story takes us although most of the setting is in the earlier period.

The movie looks great with beautiful landscapes and often shot with a long lens focusing on the sole figure of Nelly, dressed in black walking the beach.  Unfortunately the film is often stuck in neutral.  Long gazes, unnatural pauses between a question and an answer are head-scratchers.  Fiennes takes his time to develop his characters, but the film just plods along well beyond our understanding of their place in the film.  I found the film just OK.

The Blu ray transfer however is first rate.  It seems to carry an almost sepias tint throughout especially on the interior shots.  A period that still uses candles and gas lights, it looks very authentic.  The exteriors are well done, especially those wide vistas mentioned above.  The blacks are appropriately dark.  A light grain prevails which gives the film additional authenticity.  We see excellent definition in the clothing and make-up.  Much of Jones' performance comes from the anguish we often see in the close ups.  The film has a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is also very good.  This is a subtle movie and the soundtrack is as well.  I will admit to cranking up the volume a good margin higher than my usual setting.

But, you know, in order for something to be truly torturous, it can't just be boring. There must be something irritating about it, as well. For that, there was the lead actresses face. Sort of like a rat face with buck teeth. Every time she comes on screen in a close up, you  will be sickened physically without even realizing it. Truly an ugly woman.

6256278,5,B00IBIIQTU,"As everyone knows, it is hard to face up to the fact that our idols, especially idols who existed long before we did, were flawed, something that just comes from being human, despite how immortally perfect we'd like them to be. So, as a great admirer of Charles Dickens, I approached this film with some trepidation. While his life was relatively short, he did so much with it, so my first question was why in the world did they choose THIS part of his life to focus on (his meeting and life with eventual mistress Nelly Ternan). Ultimately my excitement about this film and seeing Ralph Fiennes portray the great author won out, and I watched it at last.

While I'm not a fan of the spate of biopics in the last few years that don't exactly show the subject at their finest hour (The Queen, the Iron Lady, etc,), based on Fiennes age, choosing to set the film in earlier decades before he met Nelly seems illogical. Despite expecting to dislike the film and hate Dickens even more for his cavalier and tumultuous personal life, Fiennes allows Dickens to come off as a man who did some morally reprehensible things in his personal life yet with enough humanity in him that we almost forgive him for it. He presents a very human portrait, and while there might not be a strong moral value in the story, it at least gives us a glimpse of a very complex and intriguing personality.

Ralph Fiennes always gives a beautifully acted and perfectly nuanced performance in every film that he is in, and this one is no exception. He is a master at losing himself in his roles and making you forget that he is only an actor, and as Dickens he is at his most convincing. Having read a lot about the real Dickens I feel qualified to say that he is the only person alive today who could possibly manage it. Physically, he looks so much like the man that it is almost uncanny. From the glint in his eye to the high, noble forehead and bushy beard, it really is quite amazing. He brings Dickens' manic energy and lively spirit so perfectly to life that the first time we see him in the film was quite a surreal experience for me. Talk about bringing history to life! Due to the subject matter, I expected that the only view of Dickens would be his darker side, but I was happy to see his good points touched on as well, such as his crusades against the poor and his fun-loving, playful side. He shows Dickens as a real person, not a caricature, and I honestly believe the reason he was passed over for an Academy Award was for the fact that he makes it look so natural and effortless.

Felicity Jones is also a real stand-out as Nelly Ternan, Dickens' young love interest. She effectively pulls off playing a character from age eighteen through thirty-seven (though in real life Nelly claimed she was only twenty-three), and gives a compelling performance as the young, untalented actress in awe of the great older man, whose mother was willing to let her youngest daughter become the mistress of a rich man to help secure her comfort and happiness. I surprised myself by actually feeling greater sympathy than I expected for her, due in great part to Jones' great performance. She is shown struggling, both with her growing feelings for a married man, and the moral implications that acting on those feeling will have, rather than giving right in, a refreshing contrast to today's modern-day female characters who do just the opposite. She is especially powerful in the scene where she is forced to face Dickens' cruel treatment of his wife Catherine, who delivers the bracelet mistakenly sent to her but is really for Nelly, and later on when Nelly confronts him and even rejects his first hesitant advance.

While their relationship is one that most people wouldn't approve of, at least it is actually shown to develop, unlike today's films where men and women know nothing about each other before being involved romantically. She and Dickens are drawn to each other out of sympathy, and come together more out of an emotional attraction than a physical one. Fiennes has refreshingly a light touch regarding Nelly and Dickens once they become lovers, not lingering as much as most modern-day movies often do on the tawdrier aspects. All in all it was much less sensationalized than I expected, and showed more of their mutual support for each other than anything else.

Tom Hollander likewise makes for a wonderful Wilkie Collins, not only in appearance but in character as well, and was another great addition to this film.

Fiennes directs with much of the same touches he gives his acting performances: intense, emotional, slightly gritty, accented with slight whimsy, and is the most powerful in moments of quiet. He curbs overacting and allows the unspoken feeling to come through the eyes, making for a quiet yet moving film with superb, naturalistic performances.

The color and style of the period is perfectly represented in colorful yet muted set design and costuming, which Fiennes as director took great pains to remain faithful to. The string-heavy yet sparingly-used soundtrack, played mostly at the emotional high points, is beautiful and evokes the Victorian era perfectly. All in all, this film felt less like a movie, especially a modern-day one, and more like a true window into the world of the 19th century. Hats off to Fiennes for pulling this off so effectively.

As for the pacing, I didn't feel that it dragged at all, clocking in at 105 minutes, which is quite tidy for a biopic.
There were few things in this film to complain about, but I found the intermittent flashbacks to be too distracting and broke up the flow of the main story, and, perhaps I am a prude, but I could have done without the brief love scene between Nelly and her husband.

To sum up, despite the subject matter, I liked it in spite of itself, and found it to be a very good film, with great performances, great production values, and incredible direction, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates history or good acting.",1400803200,3,6018,4.675165250236072

6256283,3,B00IBIIQTU,"I wanted to like this film. I'm fascinated by the elements Victorian England with its moralistic Dickensian contradictions - colonialism, slavery, poverty, repression, excess, etc. And while this film has shadows of these elements, it's mostly that  lots of shadows. Murkiness and shadows.

As the film opens, the camera follows hard on the heels of a young women walking briskly up a vast vacant wind-swept stretch of picturesque English shoreline. We follow as she approaches a large lone rambling beach house atop the dunes. She enters to a cacophony of children on a stage caught up in buzz of thespian activity. Theres a flash of Dickens' name on the script from which the young woman is apparently directing the children's play. There's a mention of Dickens name from the man we later learn is her husband. The mention elicits a shadow, the first of many, to cross the womans face. Later, much later, we learn she is/was Dickens mistress, Nelly Ternan.

Throughout the film, the viewer is forced to parse through the shadows and speculate about relationships and the progression of time. Future/former, past/present, alive/dead  the moody murkiness of this film is its hallmark. To lessen the guesswork and increase your enjoyment, I recommend reading a little about Nelly Ternan prior to watching this film. She was a remarkable woman in her own right who managed to salvage a degree of semi-respectability from the shipwreck of her own life following her thirteen invisible years in the shadow of the great Charles Dickens.",1400198400,2,1531,5.063492063492063

Her mother and sisters had a talent. She had none. What else was she to do?

6256311,4,B00IBIIQTU,"How times have changed! 150+ years ago, quite before the paparazzi, twitter, the social media, the celebrity gossip magazines, television news reportage, and the new frankly open sexual market, having an affair of the heart was considered as much a scandal as any crime.  Men had mistresses but they remained in the shadows and were not acknowledged much less accepted by the public eye. Claire Tomalin selected this topic as it applied to Charles Dickens and wrote a novel about it: Abi Morgan transformed it into a screenplay and Ralph Fiennes both directed and starred in this period piece. It may take some concentration on the part of the viewer (the time sequences are jumbled unnecessarily) but THE INVISIBLE WOMAN is a fine period piece.

The time is in the 1850s and Charles Dickens (Ralph Fiennes) is a famous writer, reader, and public image - and he is married to his boring obese wife Catherine (Joanna Scanlan) and has a large cadre of children. The beautiful Nelly Ternan (Felicty Jones) is an modestly talented actress who catches the eye of Dickens and Dickens, unable to tolerate his intellectually unstimulating wife,  takes the educated Ellen as his mistress with the cooperation of her mother (Kristin Scott Thomas). Aware of the taboos of society the love affair develops slowly, Nelly influences Dickens' writing, but despite their passionate love for each other - Dickens feels sensually satisfied and Nelly has a life few women of her time can enjoy - the affair blossoms, in secret. Needing to remain `invisible' despite the fact that the couple escapes the eye of society and Nelly gives birth to a stillborn sired by Dickens, Ellen becomes revolted by Charles' emotional cruelty and determination to keep her secret. In that conflict, Ellen must judge her own role in her life and decide if the price she pays is bearable. They remain lovers until Dickens death at which time Nelly marries and has a family, but Dickens will always be a shadow in her past.

The settings and costumes are appropriately dark for that period, the acting is first rate (including significant characters portrayed by John Kavanagh, Tom Hollander, Amanda Hale among others), but the film gets bogged down at times with editing problems and with the flipping of times that confuse the story rather than enhance it. It remains a fine period piece that deserves wider attention. Grady Harp, April 14",1398211200,3,2402,4.9528535980148884

In fact, Nelly was a 19th century girl of 17 when Dickens met her, not a 21st century young adult with the self-assurance portrayed by Felicity Jones.  While the acting was excellent, the screenplay is disappointing.  It was difficult to feel sympathy for the character of Dickens' wife as she was portrayed here.  In fact, she was treated with heartless cruelty by Dickens, although she still loved him.  The film does not make clear that he banished her from his bed, then his home, and refused to allow their nine children to live with her.  Instead, he put them in the care of her sister, who took his side, and then published a column stating that Catherine was an incompetent mother who had never loved their children.  He died an early death from years of intensive reading tours which he did to make the money to keep Nelly and his many separate households afloat.

6256325,3,B00IBIIQTU,"'I so loathed the old man's touch, ' Miss Ternan is quoted as saying in respectable old age, after she, at age 37, had passed herself off as a 23 year old in order to marry.

And so that fact might account for the absolutely bloodless portrayal of Nely Ternan toward the writer in this depiction of Dickens' mid-life crises.

Dickens, in fact, deserved it,  casting off his wife for the crime of getting fat and complacent after having ten of his children [ how many other pregnancies did she have, I wonder?]. The absolute cruelty with which he publicly denounced her,  insisting his children side with him and have no contact with their mother was a true abomination, particularly in the case of a self styled champion of social causes.

 Giving the best performance in the film, Joanna Scanlon brilliantly portrays Catherine Dickens, who no doubt swallowed a great deal of bitterness along with her emotions [ and lunches]  as she shared the hyperactive Dickens' life and bed for over twenty years. Ralph Fiennes gives Dickens depth and dimension yet in the end emerges as a callow fame monger primarily concerned with his social standing, reputation and wealth.

 Baby faced and rabbity lipped Felicity Jones with her modern good looks, which in no way resemble the real Miss Ternan's, pouts, stomps, cries, looks mournfully into empty space, strides across desolate beaches while bringing little of the intelligence Ternan was known for to the role. Whoever decided to make her blond and thus more doll like made a huge mistake. Additionally she looks all of twelve in her later scenes where she would have been in her 40's.

The sets and costuming are quite nice, the supporting players fine, except for Kristen Scott Thomas, in a much too subdued performance, odd considering Mother Ternan was in effect her no talent daughter's pimp, helping the romance along when she finally acknowledged the fact Ellen would be better off as a kept woman than on the stage.  Otherwise the script is deadly dull in the first half hour, while Dickens extemporizes and stars in a  boring play.

While I usually like flashback, the result is emotionally distancing--and the lack of real story line [ a strange choice considering the subject was Dickens] in favor of lingering shots of Jones' upper lip, romps through the countryside and walks across stormy beaches leaves a lot to be desired.

Perhaps it would be better to leave the lives of artists alone and concentrate on their work, and considering the legacy Dickens left, and how often the BBC televises his books, there is a great deal with which to keep us entertained.",1397779200,42,2618,4.8408071748878925

He is now  in a loveless marriage,  but  the man is still looking for someone appealing to sleep with. The acting is amazing as always with Ralph Fiennes, but something is missing and I think somehow it is passion.

6256331,5,B00IBIIQTU,"When one hears the name Charles Dickens, one thinks of some of the greatest and beloved works in the English language, DAVID COPPERFIELD, OLIVER TWIST, A TALE OF TWO CITIES, A CHRISTMAS CAROL, GREAT EXPECTATIONS and many others.

One does not think of this average-looking man with a long beard as being the pop star of his day, nor does one think of him as having a mistress over twenty years his junior.  Yet, all that is apparently true.

Screenwriter Abi Mogran adapted Claire Tomalins revealing book, THE INVISIBLE WOMAN, which tells the story of Nelly Ternan, a 19-year-old actress of limited talent, who inadvertently enchanted the renowned author, husband and father.  Dickens would, with cruelty, separate from, but not divorce his wife of many years, and secretly keep the young Nelly in comfort for the rest of his life.

The film, directed by Ralph Fiennes, who also plays Dickens, is presented in flashback from the standpoint of an older Nelly (Felicity Jones), now married but still being haunted by the memories of her clandestine relationship with the great man.

The cast, which includes Kristin Scott Thomas (as Nellys mother), Tom Hollander (as author Wilkie Collins) and Amanda Hale, is excellent, as is the cinematography of Rob Hardy whose beach landscapes, in particular, are magnificent.  The film received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Costume Design.

THE INVISIBLE WOMAN is, indeed, a handsome, emotionally involving rendering of a fascinating story.

The Blu-Ray/DVD combo-pack from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains extras: audio commentary by Fiennes and Jones, a SAG Q&A with the two stars, and their Red Carpet appearance at the Toronto Film Festival.

6256332,5,B00IBIIQTU,"All young girls should be required to view this cautionary tale about older men who decide their wives and the mothers of their children are too old, dull and fat to make the grade and who then seek to salve their libidos with a piece of crumpet.  In this case, the toast of London, the eminent author and amateur dramatist, Charles Dickens, casts his middle-aged eyes upon the dewy 18 year old Nelly Ternan who is, at first, resistant to his charms.  But these old dogs have been around the block and learned a few tricks.  They are, in the end, sexual predators.  Young girls are often frozen in their tractor beams like deer in the headlights.

  And so it goes for Nelly.  Charles whisks her off to France where they can pursue their idylls until Nelly bears him a stillborn bastard and Charles is called back to civilization by the need to give readings to earn money.  On the way back, their train derails and Charles is forced to abandon Nelly to avoid notoriety and scandal.  She is always marginalized, never legitimized by marriage.  He installs her in a house near Windsor until he dies.  She remarries but never divulges the truth about her relationship with Dickens to her new husband who only knows him as her ""childhood acquaintance.""

  This sumptuous movie, beautifully done, chronicles Nelly's tortured and guilt-ridden conscience.  She is near a breakdown.  Older, smoother lovers cannot be forgotten and are often used as a yardstick against their younger competitors.  She is flooded with the memories of the affair and death of her child.  Fortunately, she is able to unburden on an understanding local curate.  It is the saving of her.

  Fiennes is brilliant as the energetic, eternally youthful, charismatic, seductive and narcissistic Dickens.  He may have feelings for Nelly but his real focus is on his writing.  His literary characters are more real, their suffering more exquisite, than the damage he inflicts on the people around him.

  Nelly, eternally scarred by her past with Dickens, struggles bravely to carry on in her new married life as a wife and mother.

  Sexual predation by the old on the young, with its lasting consequences, is also brilliantly told by Susan Howatch in her novel ""Scandalous Risks.""",1394928000,14,2246,4.862433862433862

8640614,3,B00IBIIQTU,"Three years late watching this movie, I finally sat down and streamed it on Amazon  The Invisible Woman.

Charles Dickens.  A name known by many, and an author who has gone down in history.  Married and having sired ten children of his own, his now fat wife no longer interests him in spite of the fact hes an older gentleman.  His treatment of her in the movie is atrocious, and whether fully true, Im not sure.  He announces in the paper that he has separated from his wife.  At home, he has a handyman board up the door that adjoins their bedroom.  His wife is well aware that his affections have turned toward an 18-year old young lady, who is an actress and a mediocre one at that.

The movie, having received a not-so-warm reception upon release, is a bit odd.  Directed and starring Ralph Fiennes, I will admit he did quite well portraying the exuberant writer who loves his audience. His joy in life is telling a good tale that makes people think and tugs at the heart of its readers.  Nevertheless, on a personal note, his pursuit of the young Ellen Nelly Ternan is born from her admiration of his skill and love of his work.  Apparently, his fat wife does not possess the ability to adore him for his pen and brilliant mind, unlike Nelly who gushes with girlish adoration.

Of course, this is the Victorian era and men had mistresses.  Nevertheless, the obvious truth behind closed doors was not flaunted because society and religion knew it to be a scandal and sin.  Thus enters the silent woman, who cannot tell the world of her affair with Dickens.  She is kept hidden and well-cared for by the author, splitting his time between her and his adoring fans.

The movie portrays his mistress, Nelly, as a pining and broken hearted woman who looks upon her past with sadness.  Now married and with a child of her own, her lover has died and life has gone on physically.  The movie attempts drags us through her depression by multiple long walks on the beach as it flips back and forth between the present and the past.  The flips don't always work, and perhaps its the way the tale focuses on her blues that makes it irritating.  Dickens coldness toward his wife and treatment is an abomination to watch, which takes your likeness of him as a man and turns it stone cold.  There are extremely slow and painful scenes of intimacies between the two, which itch your finger toward pushing the fast-forward button.

Nevertheless, the scandalous tale of Dickens true-life romance with an eighteen-year-old girl when he was forty-five, is an interesting peek into a man that many admire.  What is the truth behind it all?  If you read some of the reviews on Amazon, youll discover quite a few historical corrections regarding the affair and how it all played out in real life.  As for this version, I felt no empathy for Nelly or Dickens.
