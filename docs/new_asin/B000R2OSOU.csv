8198439,2,B000R2OSOU,"""Ligalig"" a.k.a ""Anxiety"" was starred,written and directed by Cesar Montano. No question that the film was a homage to the French Film entitled ""Haut Tension"" a.k.a ""High Tension"". Watching it from beginning to end, we are reminded of the French film just like in almost all parts of the movie with respect to mood,elements of story,characters and plot twist.

One great thing about it is we get to see Cesar Montano's great performance being a highly talented Filipino actor. What makes it bad are a lot of things. These includes the comedic and melodramatic elements of some scenes that were included in Ligalig. They were obviously out of place in a homage film like this. The comedic scenes only made some of the characters look impertinent and silly. As for the melodramatics, it only made the viewer get introduced to some unwanted and out-of- place elements. Had this been eliminated,the film would just be okay. More violence and less conversations would have made it better. Unfortunately,the presence of comedic and melodramatic scenes turned it into a parody unnecessarily rather than a purely homage or better yet a Filipino version of the French film. Sad but true. Cesar Montano should learn not to combine these elements in the future should he direct and write another screenplay for a violent and horror film like these mentioned to become a great director just like he is a great actor.

The use of stylish overdrive was very much excessive. Some were definitely far from being subtle as viewers can see these special effects being used. Here's hoping that the filmmakers should learn to use them wisely the next time around.",1485302400,,1643,4.949275362318841
