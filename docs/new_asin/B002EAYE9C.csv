And Dennis Morgan's singing, especially with Lucille Norman, is beautiful.  Never heard Lucille Norman before, but she has a beautiful voice.  Love this video.",1268006400,7,280,5.488372093023256

The movie was clear and the entire family enjoyed it together. It is great to have it , if one likes old time comedy musical..I am happy to add it to my video library.",1518393600,,304,4.0
8367242,4,B002EAYE9C,"This 1951 Warner Brothers musical stars Dennis Morgan, Gene Nelson, Tom Conway, Virginia Mayo, Virginia Gibson, and Lucille Norman. The three women are a sister act (though they are not related) looking for fame, fortune, and love in Las Vegas. The plot is pretty standard as musicals go, but the songs and dances are quite good, especially ""Tip Toe Through The Tulips"" (Tiny Tim's theme), which is sung and danced by Nelson, the two Virginias, and Norman (although she sings in the number, she leaves the tap-dancing to the other two ladies, who are excellent). The other number that is a highlight is Mayo's sultry jazz-dance rendition of ""Birth Of The Blues."" Dennis Morgan and Lucille Norman, who have more of a classical background, have the best singing voices. Other songs include ""We're In The Money,"" ""When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,"" and the title track.

This musical is not top-tier, but is entertaining. Three and a half to four stars.",1507939200,,945,4.90625

8367246,5,B002EAYE9C,"Painting The Clouds With Sunshine was released in 1951. It starred Virginia Mayo, with support by Dennis Morgan. A good musical, song and dance film. Fans of Virginia Mayo will like this the most.",1485820800,,196,4.794117647058823
8367247,3,B002EAYE9C,"A purchase to honor sentiment. I always liked Gene Nelson. Not sorry I got it, but it really isn't one of the best movies.",1480809600,,122,4.125
8367248,5,B002EAYE9C,"I have always enjoyed the old musicals and have quite a large collection, i  would recommend this movie to all my friends.  ,",1400198400,3,125,4.391304347826087
8367249,4,B002EAYE9C,"""Painting the Clouds With Sunshine"" is a lively, fun-filled and star-filled musical!!  I had seen Virginia Mayo do some dancing in ""The West Point Story,"" knew of her history of dancing, and wanted to see more!  Although she is short, her proportions are ideal for a good choreographer, especially her lovely legs.  Virginia Gibson had done a nice ballet-type dance in ""Tea For Two,"" but I had to look twice in this movie to recognize her, as she must have lost a little weight.  She is a good ""hoofer,"" too. Lucille Norman I had seen in ""Starlift.""  She has, of course, a beautiful soprano voice.  Her classical voice was actually wasted on some of the simple song-and-dance numbers; however, the song ""Jealousy"" was perfect for her!!  Unfortunately, in this movie, Dennis Morgan with his higher tenor range, shut out her singing in the latter part of the song.  They did not blend well.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the musical, ""Painting the Clouds With Sunshine,"" very much and I would recommend it to anyone who likes song and dance musicals!",1313107200,6,1051,4.730769230769231
