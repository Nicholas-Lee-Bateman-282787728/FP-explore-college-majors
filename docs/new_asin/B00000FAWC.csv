7922138,2,B00000FAWC,"This video is more of a promotion for the opening of Denver's International Airport than an airshow video.  The background music for the acts showcased is too low-key, with the effect that very exciting maneuvers  draw nothing more than a yawn.  I am not pleased that this video is  promoted as an airshow video, with no mention of Denver International  Airport anywhere on the package.  We have one of the world's best airshows  here in Houston every year - so I know what I'm talking about.  Don't  bother with this video.  The stars I gave it are primarily for the Red  Arrows (England) and the Rocky Mountains in the background.",953942400,10,632,4.654545454545454
