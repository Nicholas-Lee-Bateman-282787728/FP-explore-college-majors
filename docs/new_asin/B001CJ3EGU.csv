8287924,5,B001CJ3EGU,"I was impressed by this DVD as I consider it one of the TOP DVD's (not the best though) created by World Air Routes. We begin with the exterior walkaround of the A330 followed by a flight from Dusseldorf to Beijing. The cabin presentation was somewhat disappointing but the last 2 flights (roundtrip from Dusseldorf, GERMANY to Male, MALDIVE ISLANDS) was the best part of this DVD as you can truely see a clear view of how the island and its ocean looks like. Overall I would recommend this DVD.",1220918400,,495,4.511111111111111
