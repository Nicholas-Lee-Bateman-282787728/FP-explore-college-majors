3653059,5,B001JAHPOY,"Where is season 9, CBSHE? Where's breathtakingly beautiful scenery filmed on location at Lake Tahoe during the summer of 1967 (the ""summer of love""), classics like ""Showdown at Tahoe,"" ""The Late Ben Cartwright,"" director Bill Witney's swan song ""Sense of Duty"" (but also the debut of charismatic ""Candy,"" played by the late, great David Canary), and Michael Landon's directorial debut, ""To Die in Darkness""? Please, please release this great season and remaster each episode from original film elements so we can see every little detail! Please, please include an abundance of great special features like rare photos, cast commercials and audio commentaries. Please don't short change us (and if you're considering going the cheap DVD-R route, as is rumored -- DON'T). A classic like BONANZA deserves first class treatment -- only the best from CBS. I thank you.",1465344000,4,862,5.253623188405797
3653060,5,B001JAHPOY,"I am 21 years old. Yes... young people are interested in bonanza, and other old shows. And I would like to see all the season of bonanza released. They have already released 8 of the 14 seasons. Since they are this far into the job, they might as well finish it.",1464998400,7,262,4.1568627450980395
3653061,5,B001JAHPOY,"Please get the rest of the Bonanza seasons out on DVD so we can complete our collection. This is one great western TV series that the whole family can watch and enjoy without being confronted with sadistic violence, foul language or unnecessary nudity. Please finish the DVD collection for the all the Bonanza fans!",1461196800,3,315,4.851851851851852

SPREAD THE WORD BUY THE OFFICIAL BONANZA DVD RELEASES NOW, for A HOPE IN THE REST BEING RELEASES SOONER RATHER THAN LATER!",1455667200,3,309,5.866666666666666
3653063,5,B001JAHPOY,"For the most part I no longer buy ANY show unless it is a complete set of the entire series. I got tired of being left hanging, or worse the last few seasons never being released but then a full box set  comes out forcing someone to re-buy what they had already. This is the root cause of poor sales and the companies have not figured it out yet. (Ironically it is of their own doing, and greed makes them make less money!). You can't change where we are now with Bonanza (season8). The best solution is to come out with a PARTIAL BOX SET of all the remaining 6 seasons. Everyone who is dismayed would snap it up (as it would give definite closure) and then spur sales of any single prior seasons they don't have.",1455494400,6,713,4.204379562043796
3653064,5,B001JAHPOY,"Dear CBS Paramount.
I own all 8 seasons of Bonanza that you have issued so far, LOVE THEM!
Ready to buy Season 9 - 14.
Please hurry up, I can hardly wait!",1455062400,13,154,3.84375
3653065,5,B001JAHPOY,"I cannot understand why they are holding off on releasing future seasons of bonanza.
I read that there is a moratorium on remaining seasons of bonanza and gunsmoke because some networks still play the later seasons of these shows.
I still have hope that they will continue some day releasing the remaining seasons.
Please guys just release them.
It can't just be a matter of low sales?
I see hundreds of tv shows released.
Why the cold shoulder to these tv classics?
Ok I get it there aren't as many people watching them as there used to be but come on be nice and release the remainder.
UPDATE Gunsmoke season 12 being released in Sept. 2016!!
So where's Bonanza Season 9!!
Let's go we are getting excited!!",1450396800,19,708,4.582677165354331
8312231,5,B001JAHPOY,"I really want this and the rest of the seasons 9-14 to finish the whole series. This is the classic I shared with my father and so want to enjoy the rest to perfection. Uncut.  including the final season premiere episode. ""Forever"" when Little Joe gets married. Even though it is a sad episode since she dies and they are mourning Hoss... it is still a beautiful story and I really want to see it uncut as it was shown originally.  all the episodes need to be finished.",1523923200,,469,4.318181818181818
8312232,5,B001JAHPOY,CBS...please release rest of Bonanza .  It's not fair this great show has not fully been released.  Give fans the rest of Bonanza please!!!,1517270400,,139,4.75
8312233,1,B001JAHPOY,"CBS WALKED OFF ON THE JOB OF COMPLETING THE TV SERIES. THIS IS NOT RIGHT AT ALL!!!!!  IT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL TO
START A JOB AND NOT FINISH IT. CUSTOMERS WILL BUY BOOTLEG COPIES INSTEAD BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR JOB!
I WANT TO COMPLETE THE SERIES.",1512518400,,253,4.06
8312234,5,B001JAHPOY,"Where  is  season  9?
I'll  buy  it  on  DVD  just  like  I  bought  the  first  8  seasons.  In  this  season  we  get  to  see  new  characters.  I  enjoyed  Candy's  character,  who  signs  on  with  the  Cartwright's.
I  have  been  enjoying  all  8  seasons  since  I  got  them,  Its  been  almost  2  years  since  they  released  season  8.  I  would  love  to  have  season  9  too.",1502323200,11,391,4.076923076923077
8312235,5,B001JAHPOY,What's the studios problem!!! Has Bonanza ever been off the air? They can't say it's not popular. New generations discover it. Plenty of garbage shows being released. Maybe someone only made a small killing of money and wanted more so not releasing it. I'm sure it revolves around greed somewhere! Would a petition help,1502236800,,319,4.925925925925926
8312236,5,B001JAHPOY,I can't wait any more for the 9 to 14 seasons come out. I am so excited. So come on let's get it going.,1492128000,,103,3.3333333333333335
8312237,1,B001JAHPOY,"Why oh why won't  the powers that be"" proceed with releasing the remaining seasons of Bonanza? So many of us have seasons 1-8 and would dearly love to complete our collection. It is purely BAD marketing to withhold the remaining episodes. We would love to have the ""powers that be"" to act professionally and at least give us an explanation that is logical!!",1486598400,,357,4.666666666666667
8312238,5,B001JAHPOY,"Come on now. This is utterly ridiculous. I own seasons 1- 8, and being the true fan I have for most of my life, desperately want the remaining  6 seasons. PLEASE realize this is hurting so many of the TRUE fans, like myself, not releasing the rest of the series. You have already made it past the halfway mark. Why not just finishing it up???",1475020800,4,342,4.2615384615384615
8312239,5,B001JAHPOY,Please release the rest of the Bonanza series!  I will buy them! You can make a lot of bonanza fans very happy!,1471478400,,111,4.045454545454546
8312240,5,B001JAHPOY,"When can we expect seasons 9-14 of Bonanza. I live in Australia yes you have lots of fans here, we all love the shoe BUT WHEN are the final seasons going to be released? Why do they keep showing as not available? Whats the problem? Has the re-mix machine broken down, or are there some hard headed executives somewhere just being recalcitrant, and ignoring the fact that millions of fans are pleading with them to release the rest of the series.",1467072000,3,445,4.506172839506172
