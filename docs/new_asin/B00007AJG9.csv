1804669,5,B00007AJG9,"Found this movie on TV one late night and recorded it on my DVR.  Was a little hesitant, but this movie is awesome, and I AM a movie snob.  Sure, it is low budget, and the effects are not like Transformers or Terminator 2, but the idea is great and it's got a really cult classic feel.  I was SO bummed when we switched DVR's to a newer model and I lost the recording, so I just had to purchase it.  I swear I've watched this movie 20 times and every time I'm excited.  It's a little bit of steampunk, a little bit of sci-fi, and a lot of interesting ideas.  Don't let the bad reviews fool you, if you're into those oddly cool, off the wall type of flicks, you're going to love this one.  Trust someone who considers herself a HUGE movie buff, and actually I am a screenwriter as well.  Watch this movie, I dare you!",1361664000,,816,4.088050314465409
1804670,2,B00007AJG9,"I SEEN FAR WORSE MOVIES THAN THIS.  I LIKED IT!  I THOUGHT IT WAS ENTERTAINING.  BETTER THAN A LOT OF THIS GARBAGE THERE MAKING NOW! HELLO!!!! I HOPE THEY DON'T MAKE A REMAKE OF THIS ONE. OMG...  I THOUGHT I SEEN A PIC OR A POSTER SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE ""REMAKING"" THE MOVIE ""THE THING"", AGAIN. THIS WILL BE THE 3RD TIME. I HOPE IM WRONG.",1317427200,,337,4.138461538461539
1804671,5,B00007AJG9,The movie showed up in a nice time frame and in great shape.  Thanks for a product that is in the shape you say it is.,1234310400,,118,3.5384615384615383
1804672,1,B00007AJG9,"Okay... I am not a movie snob - I can suspend my expectations and just enjoy some mindless entertainment. I think Chris Farley is hilarious. I stand up and cheer during Starship Troopers.

But there is NO redeeming quality to Subterano.  I am completely shocked that some other reviewers gave this movie anything more than the lowest rating.

On paper the plot /could/ be interesting  - hey, video game turned real, sounds good right?  Wrong. The execution is awful, the ""effects"" are 70's quality, I want to kill every one of the characters (especially the whiney one who knows the videogame), every action scene is the same (avoid the bad guy to get to the next parking level), and the bad guy is some not-scary radio controlled car.

It is the WORST movie I've ever tried to watch.  And not worst like comically bad, or so bad it's good, but simply not-laughing, dead-serious, ""why the heck am I watching this?"" bad.

Really. There is no point in watching this movie. It is awful.",1189382400,6,983,4.641618497109826
1804673,3,B00007AJG9,"I enjoyed this movie.. But before I ordered it, I checked this movie have subtitle in english or closed caption.. Because I am deaf myself and require closed caption.. It said have both subtitle and closed caption.. I was excite and bought it. But I am so disappoint and this movie not have subtitle and closed caption at all. That's BS!

Message for deaf people: Don't order this movie!",1167350400,,387,4.608695652173913
1804674,1,B00007AJG9,"This film really is a must see, if only because it is so darn bad.  It is easily a hot contender for the worst film of all time.  A single star would be far too generous.  Now, to be fair this might be considered a sort of OK childrens' film - if general ineptitude is a qualifying characteristic of many in that category (except for all the good ones of course) - but even then its R rating clearly puts it beyond the gaze of any would be toddler film buffs.  The R rating was a genuine surprise.  In Australia it was screened as a 'world premier' last new years eve.  It was late (but not late enough), and after the only profanity uttered, the character actually apologized for swearing!  Really this film is a future cult classic and should be seen either directly before or after Return of the Ring, for the sake of contrast.",1152921600,,830,4.282051282051282
1804675,4,B00007AJG9,"austrailian movie based on a virtual reality video game gone bad.
very cool characters and FX make for a really fun movie.
movie is set in a parking garage, each level of the parking garage representing each level of the game.  must see movie in my opinion.  very cool sci-fi flick, check it out.",1051056000,2,296,4.462962962962963
1804676,3,B00007AJG9,"Subterano from teh way teh cover box is designed looks like a cheesy horror film.  However once one pops in the DVD they soon realize that they are instead watching an action sci-fi thriller.
Subterano is an Australian made sci fi movie.  The plot revolves around a group of people thrust into a situation they can't control when they are trapped inside a car park at the main HQ of this toy corporation.  These people consist of four kids, an old man, a security guard, and two ex-lovers/revolutionaries.  What happens inside the building is some psycho who created this program to imitate the game Subterano, a game notoriouse for never been beaten.  THe characters must travel through seven levels and survive the traps set all in an attempte to escape.  One bye one the cahracters get picked off as egos collide, paranoia kicks in, and hatred grows deeper.
Overall this is one of those direct to video titles most will pass up as garbage.  However in it's degense it does have it's share of wit and thrills and for the most part I would probably rent again (or maybe buy someday).  Subterano is a good mid afternoon thrill ride for a rainy day or a sleepover.  Just remember that you may have some trouble finding this title.",1042675200,2,1229,4.626728110599078

7974810,5,B00007AJG9,"I like this movie. Even if it seems a lil weird, it is still entertaining to watch. Sometimes you need a movie, that's not exactly like the others, that you can just sit back and watch.",1470528000,,185,4.166666666666667
7974811,5,B00007AJG9,I know its chessy but I love it. Got what I wanted. No complaints.,1410912000,,66,3.7857142857142856
7974812,2,B00007AJG9,"This could have been a campy fun movie with some social commentary about how we objectify people when dealing with them remotely through the internet.  Unfortunately, the slow pace and foolish video game motifs made this movie painful to watch.",1381104000,,244,5.1
7974813,3,B00007AJG9,Can't say much one way or another about this one.  Typical 50-60s horror movie.  Watchable but a good book might be more interesting,1381104000,,132,4.695652173913044
7974814,1,B00007AJG9,This is one of the worst movies ever made don't even think of watching it unless you're into trying to get through the worst movies ever made.,1377648000,,142,4.296296296296297
7974815,3,B00007AJG9,"Good players, decent special effects, a few good twists and turns, but very short on location as the entire thing is filmed in a sub basement",1376784000,,141,4.461538461538462

7974817,4,B00007AJG9,"It was okay. There was action. A sort of ""Tron""-based movie except the the game enemies come into the real world.  Plenty fine for free and if you have nothing else to do, but I'd never recommend purchasing it.",1370908800,,210,4.384615384615385
7974818,5,B00007AJG9,A great cast...an exciting movie from start to finish.  It's about a group of people who are held inside a locked building trying to find a way to stay alive.  They are part of a game plan...and have to find a way to survive.  I loved it!,1363305600,,238,4.0212765957446805
