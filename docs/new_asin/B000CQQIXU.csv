8100690,5,B000CQQIXU,Great review for someone who loves the history of art!,1407888000,,54,4.5
8100691,5,B000CQQIXU,I was very happy to replace the VHS set I owned of this item.  Thanks for carrying these hard to find items,1385942400,,107,3.8636363636363638
8100692,4,B000CQQIXU,"This set of 6 DVDs offers a very good look at the periods of Art:  Late Medieval World, Baroque, Renaissance, Rococo to Revolution, Romanticism, and Impressionism/Post-Impressionism.  Art historians analyze painters and their work and tell how the culture of the times affected each.  For those wanting more detailed information about different schools and artists, there are other sets from Kultur which complement this overview very well.  If you enjoy art in a non-academic way, then I think you will enjoy this set very much.",1256342400,6,529,5.261904761904762
8100693,5,B000CQQIXU,"The value of the set is in its systematic approach to the subject. If you have genuine interest in history of impressionism this set will definitely provide. My only grudge that I wanted some entertainment and not mentoring.
If you like it my way check&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beethoven-Symphonies-1-2-3-4-5-6-and-Art-Galleries-of-the-Time-2DVDs-3CDs-Ultimate-MosaicDVD-Collection/dp/B001ETLY1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beethoven Symphonies 1,2,3,4,5,6 and Art Galleries of the Time, 2DVDs+3CDs Ultimate MosaicDVD Collection</a>&nbsp;and it is superior in image quality.
The set is nice if you are looking for methodical exploration of arts. If you are looking for an educated entertainment and excitement look the other way.",1219795200,3,778,7.376344086021505
8100694,4,B000CQQIXU,"this is an amazing box set very worth the price. if you are an art lover or even someone who just appreciates it, get it. it's very indepth and gives you great insight into the world of western art. i mean, 6 DVDs for such a low price is just unheard of these days. don't walk, run out and get it, or order it right here. :)",1140566400,8,324,3.8507462686567164
8100695,3,B000CQQIXU,"This is a very clear, well presented series with carefully paced and measured commentary. Good experts, they keep it simple. I received a good understanding of - very importantly - the attitudes and surroundings of the artists and how that affected their creativity. Good general exposition of how western art developed and diversified, as well as the techniques used through the centuries. Strong present-day location film, pleasant tempo and music. Representation of the painting and sculpture perfectly adequate, colors and line nicely presented.",1140566400,12,549,5.626506024096385
8100696,1,B000CQQIXU,This is where the sharpness of DVD should shine through.  In this presentation we have a miserable failure.  The pictures have NO definition.  They look like there were cut out of a third rate newspaper.  What could have been a glorious addition to the DVD art catalog ends up being trash not worth the $54.00 deeply discounted price.  Look elsewhere if your looking for the Landmarks of Western Art.,1138924800,26,400,4.739130434782608
