8670351,2,B00M58FRDK,"Surprisingly stupid, I thought. While it has good practical effects and gore, it suffers ultimately from poor pacing and boring dialogue. I am a fan of SOV horror as well and know the ropes of low budget horror. I just thought this was kind of bland. When the review on the box is ""Goosebumps by way of Frank Henenlotter"" -- you can't help but have high expectations. It was nothing like Goosebumps or Frank Henenlotter. Even with that review aside, the movie just doesn't cut it... I'd only buy it if you can get it cheap or if you're someone the film just happens to appeal to.",1504396800,,579,4.420560747663552

8670353,2,B00M58FRDK,"Drew (Michael O'Hear) has a succubus issue in the house he wants to sell. The film is not designed to be horror or suspense, but rather a low grade comedy that attempts at laughs through bad special effects and a dysfunctional cop ( John Renna). The sound was uneven. The plot was supposed to be funny, but there were no LOL moments. Debbie Rochon enters at about 40 minutes into the film. Dry Bones is a song reference sung to the tune of Dem Bones.

Guide: F-bomb, sex. Bad rubber special effects nudity.",1441324800,,506,4.440860215053763
