6476386,5,B00L9CDUAK,"The box set shown is for the 1987-1989 TV show, featuring Linda Hamilton, Ron Perlman, Roy Dotrice, Armin Shimmerman, Jay Acovone, Ellen Geer to name a few...............
.BUT the actor names featured in the description, say Actors: Jay Ryan, Max Brown, Austin Basis...which is the new Beauty and the Beast series with Jay Ryan and Kristen Kreuk..
Please can we have a clarification on exactly what we would be pre ordering please?? I would hate for the fans of the 1987 show to purchase this and then get the Jay Ryan BATB version. I am a huge fan of the original beauty and the beast show, so i am very concerned about the actors named in this set.",1408752000,32,650,4.516949152542373

6476421,5,B00L9CDUAK,"I loved this series of Beauty and the Beast. I remember watching it years ago but had forgotten a lot.
This story shows what true love is when you fall in love with each other based on compassion, inter strength, and good character. This type of love quickly grows into a true soul mate. This type of love reminds me of young teenage love when each one gives their whole heart to each other.
It very hard to find this type of good writing when it comes to a love story these days. I will love you if only out of site, I will love you if only in darkness by night. I found love in you when others would have only judged by your outward features
I wished I had purchased this serial years ago. I'm 100% pleased with my purchase of this serial.",1504569600,4,741,4.117241379310345

6476426,5,B00L9CDUAK,"I never got to see the whole series when it first aired as I moved to a place with no reception, but I loved the episodes I did get to see.  What a delight to now watch the entire series!  Okay, it was done in the late 1980's when TV shows were under strict rules and no one had cell phones.  That being said, it is a wonderful and otherworldly romance, sweet and heartfelt even if it takes Vincent and Catherine  a really long time to finally fulfill their love.  Well, yes, there also is a good deal of violence, but the good guys mostly win and we get to listen to some lovely poetry.  And, oh boy, there's nothing I loved about it better than having my name said over and over in Ron Perlmans', as Vincents', warm honey swirling into melted butter voice.  Ahhhh!",1501718400,2,766,4.205479452054795

6476460,5,B00L9CDUAK,This was a series that my father told my mother about and she fell in love with it.  It's a shame that it only lasted 3 seasons and I think it would have gone longer if Mrs Hamilton had not chosen to leave after her pregnancy.,1486166400,,226,3.9130434782608696

6476462,5,B00L9CDUAK,"Bought this item as a gift and I can't wait to watch it. I have watched it on Netflix and now I am happy to say I have it on dvd to watch over and over again. I rememer watching this show when I was really young with my parents and was so disappointed when it was no longer on tv. I love the romance between these two characters. This show was like a nightly soap opera but I don't recommend this show to the younger kids. This show has the lawyer with the cops trying to put the bad guys away and then you have Vince (the beast) who lives underground and has a connection with the lawyer (Linda Hamilton) and they share a love for each other that only grows over time. It is almost like that forbidden love which makes it that much more enticing but overall the story is very well written for being aired during the 80's. Some people may say the series is corny but when I think back to the 80's, this series was one to watch and I look forward to watching it many times and remembering when....",1485648000,18,996,4.086734693877551

Set was a bit different than pictured, but still good. Discs are on a removable flip-page holder inside a large, plastic clam-shell case. The only paper in the set is inside the body of the clam-shell case. It has front and back set images, similar to the ones Amazon has pictured, viewable from the outside.

6476491,3,B00L9CDUAK,"I'm reviewing the actual DVD not the quality of the material (the show is wonderful). I'm very disappointed that the content has not been remastered for widescreen TV. The episodes play in the old ""square"" format of tube TVs.  I don't mind the grainy quality, but the aspect ratio is what bothers me. To get a widescreen view I have to change the aspect on my TV manually, which sometimes leaves actors with half their heads off. If I'd known this before buying and opening it to watch, I would have waited hopefully for a better version.",1461456000,3,538,4.546391752577319

6476494,5,B00L9CDUAK,"I've read a lot of complaints from reviewers who've said an episode from the third season, ""Legacies"" was missing from the individual season DVD and from another box set that's available.  Heads up to everybody, that episode is on this box set.

I've always loved this show.  I bought several episodes when they first came out on VHS, then bought the first season on DVD.  It's great when an old TV show is put into a box set, that way, you don't have a bunch of DVD's laying around.

The only down side is that there's no ""Play All"" option on the Second Season DVD's.  After an episode ends, it goes back to the main menu and you have to do episode selection.  The up side is that there's several episode introductions by the show's stars, Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton.  There's not a whole lot of interviews with those two together so that was a plus

All in all, a great show and a great box set, and all the episodes are there.",1461024000,6,933,4.316091954022989

6476533,5,B00L9CDUAK,"I am a long-time ""tunnel dweller"" and have loved this series since its first appearance on television.  I long ago purchased the three  individual season sets, but was always put off by how unlike the lead character the pictures on all of the DVD covers were.  Vincent looked particularly ugly, and not like himself at all!  am delighted to now have all three seasons of this beloved series in a beautifully presented boxed set, even though NO NEW material appears on any of the DVDs themselves.

When I purchased this, I was confused by the fact that the description appearing on Amazon for this DVD set gave the names of the actors in the current (poorly) reimagined incarnation of Beauty and the Beast on television, not the ""classic"" series featuring Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton, which this indeed is.

My individual season DVDs are now going to a local senior center, where the romantic and heartbreaking story is a big hit with some of the residents,  I am delighted with this boxed set and happy to share the story of Vincent and Catherine!",1416268800,35,1050,4.704918032786885
6476534,5,B00L9CDUAK,This is a great series that ran from 1987-1991. Lasted only three seasons. You have the cast wrong. Jay Ryan is the pretty boy that plays Vincent in the CW bad reboot. Actually it is not a reboot but a loosely ( very loosely) remake of the original.,1415577600,,249,4.208333333333333
