5047770,4,B0071LEQ1A,"Ryner and Ferris have returned home after dealing with the Alpha Stigma incident. They begin to realize that Sion is being taken over by a darkness inside of his soul. Sion is using ends to justify his actions. Ryner and Ferris have not totally realized that he is behind some of the tragedies that are befalling the people. It won't be long before his true nature is revealed. But Ryner and Ferris are loyal friends. They will not abandon Sion, and hopefully Sion will realize that no end is worth sacrificing his friends.

This anime is pretty good. I like the characters, voice actors, animation, and soundtrack. The story is also really good. The big downfall of this series is that it just sort of stops in what should be the middle of the story. There could easily be another whole season after this. Nothing is resolved, and the world is in more turmoil than it was in the beginning. I could give this anime 5 stars if it didn't just stop where it did. There could be more to come. You never know. But now it reminds me of how Berserk just dropped off in the middle of the story and never finished. Even so, This anime is worth watching. Lets just hope they continue it.",1361750400,4,1177,4.423963133640553
5047771,5,B0071LEQ1A,"It is kinda pointless to write more about the story. The people before me have done that already although speaking from a personal POV I must say I really liked it. It is one of the few series that does not rely on pointless and idiotic fanservice with panty flashes and boob exposure.

The set contains BOTH a DVD set AND a Blue Ray set so even if you haven't a blue ray unit you can still enjoy it until you can afford a BD player.

Another good thing is that both the DVD and the Blue Ray set work perfectly on Region 2/B machines. In other words it will work just fine if you have a PS3 unit from Europe. (It works perfectly on my slim PS3 and my unit has official firmware and is not modded in any way to bypass protections and stuff.)

The same goes for the first part of the set. http://www.amazon.com/The-Legend-Legendary-Heroes-Limited/dp/B0071LEN3Q/ref=cm_rdp_product

All disks will run on region 2/B machines.

So for anyone still unsure I say feel free to buy it. You won't have troubles watching it.

Small detail that I must clarify though. I am using an HDMI cable and HD monitor to watch it and it works fine. However I can NOT confirm it will work on old TV sets that can not support NTSC signal.",1359590400,,1214,4.397321428571429
5047772,5,B0071LEQ1A,"I first stumbled accross fan subs for these and well I watched all the episodes.  I loved it, in fact I think it beat my love for neon genesis Evangelion which was my favorite all time series.

I found fan translations of the novels at baka tsuki... Unfortunately, most of the books remain untranslated, they're in dire need of translators at baka tsuki.  I read the 5 translated volumes of Dai Densetsu no yuusha no densetsu and it takes the story much further than what the anime presented.  In fact, the anime itself is just the first and second volume of the first series of books Densetsu no yuusha no densetsu... Basically what I'm saying is that that's probably only 5% of what occurs in the books.  The amount of detail and plot twists that are presented in these books are just absolutely phenomenal.

I'd come close to call it the harry potter of the east if anything.  Honestly if the books were translated and if the anime  continued on i'd say it could potentially beat the harry potter series as good as they were.  You are truly immersed in this story and there's sooo much that happens and so much that can potentially happen.

Now i'm pending on translations that happen every 4-6 months for one measly chapter or two.  At this rate I think I'm better off learning japanese or chinese to just read these series ( and i've thought about it multiple times, unfortunately i don't have the time i used to anymore).

Anyways, if you're looking forward for a fun experience that brings in rich content a ton of mystery and somewhat a more harsh reality in a story as opposed to what the west ussually presents us with, definitely buy these dvds and watch the anime.

However, just keep in mind the series will only give you a glimpse of what the books are about.

I really hope someday someone actually does official translations into english for the light novels.  There's tons of volumes with a lot of side stories and rich content, it just beats me why no other studio like Bones hasn't taken over the project yet.",1359072000,,2028,4.532967032967033
5047773,4,B0071LEQ1A,I absolutely love this series. It quickly became one of my favorites. The only bad thing about is that it didn't have a conclusive ending. It left alot of questions unanswered. Fingers crossed that one day they'll dub the rest.,1356652800,7,227,4.7
5047774,5,B0071LEQ1A,"Loved it, they should have continued it. There is a manga about it that continues on. From what i read from wikipedia about what happens in the manga, its different. The anime is still very good. its worth it.",1356480000,,209,4.384615384615385
5047775,4,B0071LEQ1A,"Adventure, political intrigue, action...all this and more can be found in FUNimation's Blu-ray release of ""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" (Densetsu no Yusha no Densetsu), an anime adaptation of Takaya Kagami's popular Japanese light novel series.

Originally featured in Dragon Magazine and presented with illustrations by Saori Toyota from 2002-2005, ""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" has received a light novel sequel, plus two spin-off series (a collection of short stories) plus drama CD's and a Sony PSP video game.

A 24-episode anime TV series was produced by ZEXCS and both parts will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment in April 2012.

The anime series was directed by Itsuro Kawasaki (""arc the Lad"", ""Noir"", ""Venus to Mamoru""), screenplay by Kiyoko Yoshimura (""Chocolate Underground"", ""Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing"", ""Gravion""), character designs by Noriko Shimazawa (""Final Approach"", ""Otoboku"", ""Bleach"") and music by Miyu Nakamura (""Utawarerumono"", ""Manyu Hiken-cho"").

VIDEO:

""The Legend of Legendary Heroes"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1). The anime series does feature beautifully painted backgrounds (as one would expect from an adventure-based series) primarily trees, clouds, surroundings areas, while the series does focus a lot on closeups of the characters. There is CG use when the characters display their magical powers but for the most part, the series looks good on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for the lossless audio, you get a English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 mix. The English dub has a better dynamic range (considering it's a 5.1 lossless track, while the Japanese version is a 2.0 lossless track) and due to the complexity and many characters featured in this anime series alone, FUNimation Entertainment brought out their top guns to provide the voices of the characters.

The Japanese soundtrack is also very well done especially when it comes to the more emotional moments, the voice acting is stellar. But the English dub has the advantage because of it's 5.1 mix but if you prefer to watch it in Japanese or English, both soundtracks are excellent and should appeal to Sub/Dub anime fans.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes: Part 2 comes with the following special features:

  Episode 21 Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Joel McDonald ADR Director and Eric Vale (voice of Sion).
  Episode 24 Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Ian Sinclair (voice of Ryner) and Luci Christian (voice of Ferris).
  Textless Opening Song - Featuring the opening theme ""Last Inferno"" by Ceui.
  Textless Ending Theme Song - Featuring the ending theme ""Filament of Light"" Takagi Ayahi.
  FUNimation Entertainment trailers

JUDGMENT CALL:

Who's side will you choose?

This is the storyline of the second half of ""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes"".  Where the first half featured various branching storylines of various characters of the fantasy/adventure series, the second half now focuses on protagonist Ryner Lute.

Ryner has pretty much aligned himself with Sion because of his fight for peace but when Sion's own staff and also Sion himself knows that in order to accomplish peace, you must take out those who can cause trouble to the land and that includes those who are possessed with the Alpha Stigma, that includes his best friend, Ryner Lute.

The second half of the series actually becomes quite exciting as we see so many things working against Ryner, may it be Sion (who is constantly battling himself due to ""The Mad Hero"" of whether or not he should kill Sion), Lucile Eris (who wants Ryner dead because he sees his sister starting to develop emotions for Ryner), Miran Froaude (who wants Ryner dead because he feels Ryner is what makes Sion to week and compassionate) and the list goes on.

So, for fans wanting something deeper and a bit more complexity with their anime series may enjoy ""Legend of the Legendary Heroes"", a storyline about warring kingdoms, political corruptness, action/fantasy/adventure, etc.

""Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" incorporates lot of fantasy elements that people are used to seeing in an anime series, sword fighting, magic-use and in the case of this series, plenty of violence. While watching the series, while there are protagonists and people who seem they are evil, every characters has their flaws. For example, Sion wants to fight for peace, but in order to achieve peace, one must do the unthinkable in showing people that you have great power.  And in the greater good, he must eliminate even his best friend Ryner. Ryner is a person who hates war but when his Alpha Stigma is used, he becomes a killing machine.  No one is perfect in this anime series.

""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" is a series that viewers will want to watch without any distractions because of the amount of characters featured in the series. Granted, with each branching storyline, there is a good amount of character development that allows the viewers to understand motivations and why things are happening like they are.

Despite the complexities of this anime series, you get a bit of seriousness and humor. For example, storylines that related to Sion are often serious and emotional, while storylines revolved around Ryner and Ferris (non-battle sequences) are often comedic as the two are like a ranting couple and despite the pain that Ferris puts Ryner through, the relationship between these two characters are hilarious, until you get to the battles and things can get very serious.

As for the Blu-ray release, the series looks absolutely wonderful in HD but I wish the series was self contained as a complete collection instead of two separate parts. As for special features, you do get a few audio commentary from the English dub voice actors.

""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes: Part 2 turned out to be a wonderful second half.  While it did focus primarily on Ryner Lute, it's no surprise as his storyline is quite centric to the other branching storylines in the series.  But if there is one problem I have is why hasn't there been a continuation of this intriguing anime series?

After watching ""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes"", you can't help but want to watch more because the series ends when everything is starting to become so exciting and so good!

The fact that ""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" in Japan has continued to exist via 11 volumes, followed by another 9 volumes for ""The Great Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" and another 11 volumes for ""The Legend of Legendary Heroes Anyway"" and five volumes for ""The Legend of the Black Fallen Hero"", not to mention a web radio series and video game, it would be a shame if in America, our introduction to this anime series begins and ends with this anime series.  It's like watching ""Lord of the Rings"" and the two films after were never created.  So, I really do hope a second season is created!

Overall, ""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" has turned out to be a wonderful, complex and addictive anime series!  And there is no doubt that once this first season is complete, you will be wanting even more.  But for those who are looking for a deeper and entertaining anime series on Blu-ray, I highly recommend giving ""The Legend of the Legendary Heroes"" a chance!  Recommended!",1352332800,,7390,5.025430680885972

5047779,5,B0071LEQ1A,"This review covers the whole series (Part I and II) and contains no spoilers.

- Introduction -

These 24 episodes are a prelude. A prologue. This anime is an adaptation of the light novel series. It is an excellent series nevertheless, in anime or light novel format.

Unfortunately the light novels which cover the story after these 24 episodes, as of now, remain largely untranslated. The story gets so juicy after 24 episodes. But. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginning.

Ryner Lute and his friend Sion go to a military school for the poor and the orphaned. They train for war as tools for the nobels. The setting is much like Europe, multiple nations, multiple war fronts, and tension between all kingdoms/nations.

The school is sent out on a mission. I won't say how it ends, for it would be a spoiler but it's not too interesting. In fact, it is rather predictable. The anxiety and constant fear of the red headed main female character gives it away.

Ryner is arrested after the battle and is tortured for being an Alpha Stigma, a powerful magician-berserker. Sion is chosen to be the hero of the battle and the red headed female is released in exchange for Ryner's freedom. (The red headed female is such a minor character I can't recall her name.)

Ryner spends years writing a thesis in regard to legendary relics of power. Sion, now king, discovers this thesis and spares Ryner from the death penalty (given automatically to Alpha Stigmas).

From here Ryner meets Ferris, a bishoujo that is a demon with the sword -- and dango consumption.

I think that's enough summarizing. Let's get into why this anime is so good.

- Characters -

Ryner and Ferris both have lazy and laid back personalities. Whereas Sion has a workaholic drive and endless ambition. This foil creates a fun and comedic atmosphere. Ryner and Ferris slack and Sion gets on their case for being such slackers. All three of these main characters change subtly throughout the anime, then at the end you can see the accumulation of all the subtle changes. It's drastic. They've changed. And it changes the relationship dynamic. Bonds are broken and bonds grow closer.

In short, the characters are fun and memorable.

- Plot -

You won't be disappointed with the plot. There are political elements (corruption, struggles for the throne, crises, alliances), constant war (nations fighting against one another, major powers rising, weaponry), and how the characters play into these worldly events. The characters featured in this anime are major power players. The world moves around them in this anime. They are the strongest and they are the most powerful. The most powerful change the world.

- Packaging -

The packaging for this anime is rather nice. Individual slots for each disk, a decent box, and a small tarot card bonus for each Part. The special edition for Part I includes a red box inside with some neat character art, but both Part I and II have lackluster art on the outer boxes. Part I's special edition box's backside is akin to the DVD covers. The DVD covers feature main characters and also decorate the inside. They're alright. At least consideration was taken into decorating both the inside and outside of the DVD case (whoops, I forgot, I meant Blu-ray case). The DVD's/Blu-Rays are nothing special. Blue themed disks for Blu-ray, red for the DVD's. The art on both is just an Alpha Stigma symbol. Not exciting but it works.

Can you tell by now? I'm sure you looked at the product picture and could figure it out. Part I and II are a combination of Blu-rays and DVD's.  So you get to watch the whole series in either Blu-ray or DVD quality. Yippie. It's a nice bonus.

- Quality -

I won't review the quality aspect of this release. I don't have time anymore to watch the whole series again (for the third time) but I can tell you that it should be good. Come on. It's Blu-ray.

8508431,5,B0071LEQ1A,"This is a really enjoyable series whether you watch subbed or dubbed.
The one downside- and the reason why so many reviews mention that it feels incomplete- is that the manga writer died. What I have been told is that the way Japanese copyrights or at least ownership of the manga and subsequent adaptations remains with the original writer and is passed to his or her family upon their death. So the animation company can't finish the anime without permission from the family and they haven't given it to them.
That being said you won't regret taking the time to enjoy this show.",1409875200,,580,4.640776699029126
