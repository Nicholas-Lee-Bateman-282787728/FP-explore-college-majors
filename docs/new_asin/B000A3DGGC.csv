2356167,4,B000A3DGGC,"This is a great yoga DVD for people looking to do more of a yoga workout than a yoga relaxation due to the pace and structure.  If you are looking for a good 10 minute yoga routine for relaxation, try the original 10 Minute Solution with Michelle instead.",1140739200,10,255,4.3125
2356168,5,B000A3DGGC,"I really like this workout , I didn't buy it for the 10 minute segments because I think doing Yoga for this short amount of time isn't really effective but for a 50 or 40 minute workout (if you want to omit 1 segment) it's pretty good. I felt really energized after doing it. The abs segment really reminded me of pilates and has a mix of boat variations and more. My favorite segment is ""yoga burn"" which is a fast flow of yoga postures (not sun salutations!) like rolling on your back to plough pose then rolling back to standing for a few times and more, it was really fun. While there are no really advanced poses here, you can definitely work up a sweat if you do the whole thing but I wouldn't recommend this for beginners. Lara is a very good and likable instructor her cuing is also good ,the only minus is that there's no savasana at the end . All in all if you want a non intimidating and energizing yoga workout it's definitely a good choice.",1140480000,32,953,4.241758241758242
2356169,4,B000A3DGGC,"I really enjoy this dvd, each section may be brief but it is exactly what I want.  I find these workouts to be relaxing & great to use after strength/cardio workouts or alone on off days.",1137542400,8,187,4.194444444444445
2356170,5,B000A3DGGC,Lara is one of my favorite instructors. I find myself going back to this workout as well as her Pilates workout over and over. This DVD is excellent. The yoga poses are very relaxing and thorough. The Yoga Burn section is challenging and alot of fun. The 10 minute sections make them easy to fit in before bed or after a run. Excellent!! Hope to see Lara in another video soon!,1133568000,9,377,4.323943661971831
2356171,5,B000A3DGGC,"Lara Hudson has designed five excellent 10-Minute yoga workouts, each with a different focus. Basics and Burn are total body energizers which will challenge your strength and agility with smooth-flowing standing poses. Buns & Thighs uses standing poses to build leg strength and improve your balance, as well as a few floor poses to target inner thighs and core. Abs focuses on improving core strength with challenging poses on the floor. Flexibility & Relaxation thoroughly stretches out the legs, hips and torso with more poses on the floor.

The 10-minute workout concept works very well for yoga, especially if you want to branch out and get more yoga into your weekly schedule, without cutting into your regularly scheduled cardio or strength workouts. If so, this DVD allows you to easily add just one segment to another workout for added strength or flexibility work. However, if your focus for the day is yoga, the versatile DVD program menu also allows you design a custom yoga workout of up to a 60 minutes.

>>>> Workout Details
Basics:
The first run-through is pretty slow, so you can learn the vinyasa pattern and warm up, then pace picks up. Begin seated for breathing practice, 3x, then stand for two versions of the sun salutation.
Basic sun salutation vinyasa is done twice: mountain pose, forward bend, back extension, high plank, low plank, up dog, down dog, forward bend, forward extension, stand while reaching arms overhead, bring hands into prayer in front of chest, and return to mountain pose.
Repeat this vinyasa twice more, each time adding leg extensions in down dog, and warrior 1 on each side.

Buns & Thighs: standing and floor poses at a faster pace, challenging your balance
Opens with chair pose, then moves into the second version of the sun salutation vinyasa above, this time adding warrior 2 after warrior 1 on each side. While holding each warrior 2, you straighten and bend the front leg 3x before continuing on. After the last plank, instead of going into up dog, you lie face down on the floor to work the inner thighs by opening and closing the legs slowly 2x, adding arm sweeps 3x, then one last torso lift with hands clasped behind back.
After a quick break of catback & childs' pose, you stand up to continue the vinyasa, adding chair pose with a twist to each side after the back extension. The final vinyasa adds high crescent pose on each side, holding and straightening the front leg 3x before continuing on.

Abs: all poses on the mat
Begin seated on mat for boat pose (v-sit with hands holding onto backs of thighs, shins parallel to floor). Next, extend both legs 5x, then place hands on floor behind your hips, lower down onto your forearms, again extend and retract both legs 10x.
Lie on your back with both hands under your glutes for double leg lifts 5x. Next, lying with legs bent in chair position and arms extended forward, upper crunch 10x, then oblique crunches L 10x, and R 10x.
After a full body stretch, work the obliques with side-lying double leg lifts 10x, and two holds before switching to the other side.
End with two challenging poses: begin in Boat pose, then roll upper back down to floor while extending both legs 10x. For the grand finale, Lara does some wrist rolls in prep so you know it's going to be tough. Begin in a face-up bridge or table-top, then lower your glutes, but don't let them touch the floor, rather, keep pushing them backwards while straightening your legs until your butt is behind your arms and you're balanced on your hands and heels (It's like Cathe's ""levitation"" move in Core Max, but with straight legs instead of crossed legs.) Alternate between the bridge and the ""levitation"" 5x, then stretch the abs with Cobra and Childs pose.

Burn: standing poses flowing to floor and back up
Begin with the opening sun salutation vinyasa from Buns & Thighs, including the leg extension in down dog, warrior 1 & 2, and adding triangle pose, and warrior 2 & 1.
After doing each side, hold high plank for 5 breaths, then do side planks on each side (on feet & one hand).
After childs pose, knee for camel pose slow (kneeling backbend) then swoop forward putting chest on thighs with arms extended behind, alternate these two poses 5x.
""Up dog, down dog flow"" alternating each pose 5x.
Stand in mountain, then a challenging chair pose vinyasa: start in chair pose, then lower glutes to sit on floor and roll backwards onto shoulders (not neck), extending legs overhead, then roll forward, into standing forward bend with hands clasped behind back, lift quickly into chair pose. Repeat 5x.

Flexibility & Relaxation: seated and lying poses
Seated: butterfly stretch (bound angle pose), lateral bend over L leg, spinal twist same direction, untwist in opp direction, repeat on R side. Lie face up for bridge pose, then extend both legs, R knee to chest, hold R big toe with peace sign fingers for ham stretch, then inner thighs, lying spinal twist, repeat on L side. Finish with corpse pose.

>>>> Fitness level
Experience with yoga would be advised for this workout because the poses, although very well-cued, are meant to flow smoothly, so you need to be able to get into a pose pretty quickly and transition to the next one quickly too. Although the Basics segment sounds like it should be easy, it moves along at a good pace, and the sun salutation, with many up dogs and down dogs, requires good upper body strength as well as wrist strength. A few poses at the end of Burn and Abs are quite challenging -- definitely something to work up to. Flexibility & Relaxation is the easiest segment, and doable by all levels, because it's goal is exactly that: flexibility and relaxation. If you're still struggling with balance in Warrior poses, can't step into and out of down dog quickly, or can't hold Boat pose, you may want to avoid frustration and try an easier yoga workout.

>>>> Instruction & Cueing
Lara does an excellent job of cueing the poses and each breath. Lara is encouraging in a laid-back way, and seems very confident and knowledgeable in her instructions. Her delivery is calm and low-key as she leads you smoothly through each pose, step by step and breath by breath. She offers technique pointers and frequently explains the fine points of each pose, allowing you to make adjustments as needed. You don't need to watch the TV at all, which is very helpful, because often you can't...or at least you shouldn't be turning your head to see the next move.

>>>> Set
Studio with wood floor, peach walls, opaque windows. Plants and fitness equipment scattered against the walls.

>>>> Crew
Lara is alone on camera, so there are no alternatives shown for some of the harder poses, although she usually shows an easier version first which you can stick with if needed.

>>>> DVD features
Main menu has three choices:
Create a Personalized Workout: choose up to 6 segments from this Menu, to play in the order you want, segments can be repeated

Pick One Workout: play one segment at a time, when done you're sent back to Pick One menu to choose another

Play All: segments play in this order: Basics, Buns & Thighs, Abs, Burn, Flexibility & Relaxation

Choosing the order of workouts
If you're going to do all 5 segments in a row, start with Basics as your warm-up, then do Buns & Thighs and Burn (in either order, doesn't matter which comes first). Abs works the core with challenging moves, so it's best placed after the standing segments, so that you're not trying to balance or perform moves quickly with pre-fatigued abs. Flexibility & Relaxation should always be placed last.

For a well-rounded half-hour yoga workout, start with Basics to warm-up and get energized, then depending on your goal for the day, put Buns & Thighs, Burn or Abs in the middle, and end with Relaxation to gently and thoroughly stretch you lower body and torso.

Upward dog
There are a lot of upward dogs in the three standing segments. It takes a lot of upper body strength to lift your hips and legs off the floor until only the tops of your feet are resting on the floor. You can always modify this to a cobra pose (lifting only your torso off the floor, leaving your hips grounded). However, you'll be surprised at how quickly you'll build strength if you keep at it -- so don't give up! One caution: don't overarch your lower back in up dog (or in cobra either) by tilting your head backwards or pushing your chest forward. You'll notice that Lara's upper torso is perpendicular to the floor in this pose, her shoulders are directly over her hands, and she's looking straight ahead, so she doesn't have an excessive arch in her lower back. It helps to practice this pose sideways to a mirror a few times, so you can see how far backwards you're leaning.

Balance help for Warrior poses
Lara gives an excellent cue for the back foot in Warrior position. She cues you to put your weight on the outside of the back foot, which helps to engage the quads and lifts the arch off floor. If you've ever had trouble balancing in warrior, this cue should help you feel more solid in that split-leg stance.

As a matter of fact, lifting the arches of your feet off the floor in any standing pose helps to align the knees properly, engage the quad muscles and improves balance. Beryl Binder Birch, in her excellent book, Power Yoga explains the basic foot stance this way: ""The weight of the body is distributed in three places in the foot -- in the ball of the foot behind the big toe, in the ball of the foot behind the third and fourth toes, and in the center of the heel."" Beryl suggests that flat feet (fallen arches) which are often treated by prescribing orthotics for one's shoes, would be better corrected by doing yoga -- ""by consciously and repeatedly shifting the weight toward the outside of your feet throughout practice, thereby developing and strengthening the arches.""

If you have trouble with balance during yoga, you'll find that concentrating on pressing down through these three points and spreading your toes wide against the floor, will automatically lift the arches of your feet and improve your ability to balance on one foot for Tree or in split stances like Warrior, Triangle or Crescent poses. It will also enhance your feeling of groundedness in Mountain and Chair poses.

Double leg lifts (Abs)
Having your hands under your glutes should help to protect your lower back for this exercise. If you feel any strain in the low back, stop lowering your legs at that point. As your abs get stronger, you'll be able to get your legs lower safely. Remember that Lara has been practicing yoga for a long time and is quite strong. If you can't lower your legs as much as she does, that's ok. Recognize your own limits and adjust the move accordingly. You can do this exercise with your knees bent as much as 90 degrees and still be working the ab muscles. You can also lift and lower one leg at a time.

Boat pose roll back with leg extensions (Abs)
This exercise has a Pilates feel to it, and can be very challenging for the low back. In Pilates, you start with your upper back on the floor and curl up, whereas here you start seated and lower down to the floor. If you can't smoothly curl up and down as much as Lara, limit your range of motion when you lean back.

Bridge/table-top swing-through vinyasa (Abs)
If you have a long torso and short arms, you may have trouble holding yourself high enough off the floor to bring your glutes backwards. To make this easier, rest your hands on two yoga blocks or two thick books (I used one yoga black and my paperback copy of Gray's Anatomy) to give your glutes more clearance for your swing backwards. (I couldn't do this at all when I had my hands on the floor, but the extra clearance I got from the books made this vinyasa quite doable. (I surprised myself!)

Chair vinyasa (Burn)
If you're not flexible or nimble enough to sit on the floor directly from chair pose, roll back and forward and return to standing all in one smooth move, you can modify by holding the chair pose while Lara does the roll. This is a very advanced move.

2356172,2,B000A3DGGC,"I was excited to get this DVD because of all the short targeted workouts it offered.  My problem is that the pace was too fast for me to actually learn yoga and get anything out of it.  I think they've taken what should be at least a 20 minutes session and crammed it down to 10 minutes.  The are no workouts for different levels, it's just all the same.  After trying the ""Basics"" and ""Buns & Thighs"" sections I was afraid to even see what the ""Burn"" would be.

Another issue I had is that when I programmed my own workout I mistakenly chose the same routine twice and it let me. It wasn't until I played it and got to the repeat that I realized I'd done this. I'm not a fitness expert and don't know if it's really good for my body to do these workouts in any order I'd like.

Overall, I'd say that if you are already familiar with yoga, are flexible and in good condition and want fast workouts that are fast paced, then this might be ok for you. I returned the Pilates one unopened.  I'll stick with the other Pilates DVDs I have that are better suited to me and offer me tons of options in ready made workouts at different lengths, and at different levels of difficulty so I can progress comfortably.",1133136000,17,1205,4.21304347826087
2356173,5,B000A3DGGC,"This DVD was so great. I am a Rodney Yee Yoga fan, but I really enjoyed this one. Lara is so clear and her form and instruction are great. The Yoga burn section was amazing! What a challenge and very cool that you can just squeeze in 10 minutes anytime. Perfect!",1127865600,7,262,4.1568627450980395
2356174,3,B000A3DGGC,"Lara Hudson is a good instructor and she does a good job here, she cues everything really well, but to be honest it's a bit too short.  For experienced yoga fans, you may be disappointed (unless you want a quick hit if you're running short on time).  If you are a beginner then skip this too.  You are never in one posture for a long lengths of time so that's why it's not the best for serious yoga heads, but if you travel or are a busy mom then go for it.",1126915200,8,457,3.9456521739130435
2356175,5,B000A3DGGC,"I'm one of those people who is always on the run and looking for a quick moment in the day to burn some calories without getting overly exhausted... and this video hits the spot! I was a fan of the teacher (Lara Hudson) from her other video and this is an even better addition to my workout regimen. Her cueing is as strong as it was in the Pilates version of the 10 minute video series and once again, this is the kind of video that you do again and again and never get bored with. She continually shows you a slightly more advanced version to keep the work out challenging and the video fresh. As I travel quite a bit, this will be another great element to my ""on the road and in the hotel"" work out. Definitely a great fitness video with some excellent instruction.",1126051200,4,768,4.2312925170068025
2356176,5,B000A3DGGC,"This DVD is perfect! Its a good work out! It has it's challenging levels and basics. If you're heavy into yoga, this maybe level one for you. Those who are beginners or familiar with yoga, or do it because the stretches are good for you and to release tension- you will like this! Perfect 10minute blocks to add on to your work out routine or do the whole DVD. Glad I bought it!",1478304000,3,378,4.191780821917808
2356177,3,B000A3DGGC,"I have very fond memories of doing this video during the holidays super early in the morning before work when it was still dark out. I'd light my Christmas tree, roll my mat out, and pop this into the old DVD player. Actually, looking back, this might be one of my first introductions into the world of yoga (though, I admit, it still feels pretty Pilates-centric to me). Lara Hudson gives easy to follow directions (as she does in all her videos). It's got five great segments:
1. Yoga Basics (which really is about as basic as it can get; essentially a step by step guide on sun salutations)
2. Yoga for Buns and Thighs (lots of chairs, planks, and warrior variations)
3. Yoga for Abs (this is where it felt like we veered from yoga and started doing pilates)
4. Yoga Burn (a really smoothly paced vinyasa flow; my favorite of the segments - I usually did it twice through)
5. Yoga for Flexibility and Relaxation (basically ten minutes of stretching)

All of that being said... unfortunately, as I've mentioned in other 10 Minute Solution reviews, these videos just aren't necessary anymore. You can find these videos all for free streaming on Youtube now. You can find all sorts of yoga options actually, so I'm not sure I would recommend this to a brand new practitioner.",1478217600,4,1275,4.616740088105727

2356179,4,B000A3DGGC,"I got this yesterday and I got the pilates one today. I was not able to make it past the basic part. This was a lot harder than I expected it to be. But I am out of shape and not flexible anymore. So I think as long as I keep working on it, it will end up being a good dvds. The pilates was a little easier for me to do and it was definitely a hard workout. Both dvds they make it look simple, but for out of shape people who can lose some weight they are both hard. But get it, it just means you have to work at it to be able to actually get through the whole dvd. I did end up ordering the yoga beginners 10 minute solution. I think since I am not use to doing it, it could be better to do that one first and feel a little less awkward. But if your serious about getting in shape and more flexible I think both this yoga one and the pilates will really help accomplish that.",1471219200,,876,3.766304347826087

2356184,5,B000A3DGGC,"I am addicted to this DVD. I'm 58 years old and in relatively good shape for my age. I do the last segment, Flexibility & Relaxation, every day as my cool down regardless of what workout I do, as well as on rest days, or days that I just don't have the time for a full workout, Its the only time of the day that I feel completely relaxed and pain free. I really hate to move after I've finished I'm so relaxed! The other 4 segments are also great, but I rarely do the Basic segment anymore as its mostly a tutorial on some very basic yoga positions. I would not really call this true yoga. Its more quick workouts using basic yoga moves as the base. That being said, it is effective, especially for someone my age. The Buns & Thighs segment really gets your quads burning, Yoga for Abs also gets your core working, Yoga burn goes at a little faster pace with repeating variations of up/down dog positions and for me is more of an upper body workout.

I usually do the 2nd workout first because I think it involves more stretching then do the others (2-1-3-4-5).  I love the variety and feel like I'm targeting multiple areas.  I also like her personal approach.  I am not a morning person and sometimes have no patience for overly perky cheery videos.

2356212,3,B000A3DGGC,So ive lost 45 lbs and im looking for toning exercise.  Most ive tried still felt dancy bouncy cardioy. There are segments of this video that feel great for toning. Alot of twisting and exaggerated movements. You will feel the leaness in your body.,1422316800,,248,4.636363636363637

2356216,5,B000A3DGGC,"Great for beginners, I love that you can do just the first sequence to un-wind from a stressful day, or when I have time I will do all together for a moderate level workout.  I really like Laura Hudson, she has a calming demeanor but not annoyingly so.",1410912000,,252,4.25
2356217,4,B000A3DGGC,"This is a hard core work out, even if it is only 10 minutes.  It is a bit hard to pick up the steps, but you have to keep telling yourself to give it time.  Just like if you were in a class, it takes time to learn it.  But better than the public class, no one can see you screw up.  Basic moves keep you moving until you get everything down.  You will work up a sweat even with those basic moves.  If there would be one thing to improve, there should be a better warm up/stretch.  It is well worth the money though.",1407110400,2,515,3.8476190476190477
2356218,3,B000A3DGGC,"I love it because I have time for about 10 minutes and the moves are just right for what I am looking for. However,  I can't get it to let me pick individual sections. I have to go through the series to get to what I want. This is really aggravating.  Maybe I got a bad dvd?",1406937600,,274,3.789473684210526

2356220,5,B000A3DGGC,"I love this yoga program so much. I originally came across the program on Netflix streaming, but at some point it was removed. I used to go through all five, 10-minute 'work-outs' every single day, and wanted to get back into that routine. I paid $8 for the DVD and I would have gladly paid as much as $25. From start to finish Lara's instructions are very easy to follow, easy to go easy on yourself or to push yourself, and you can get what feels like a complete 'yoga work-out' in an hour. I have tried other yoga video programs, and sometimes the instructor moves too fast and I can't get a good breathing rhythm down, some are too slow. Lara's movements and breathing timings are perfect for me. I cannot more highly recommend this DVD.",1405036800,,741,4.416058394160584
2356221,5,B000A3DGGC,The instructor is calm and helpful in explaining the poses. You can choose which workouts you want to do in what order and this is great for me because I don't have time for long workout sessions. This is great for beginners.,1402617600,,225,4.380952380952381

2356223,5,B000A3DGGC,I originally found this when it was on Netflix but they pulled it off and I couldn't live without it.  The format is great for beginners but it can easily be made more difficult as you progress.  I love the 10 minute portions as I often only have time for ~30 minutes so I can pick the sections I most want to do that day.  The only minor issue I have is that it's hard to progress through the chapters on my streaming device (PS3).  You have to just time the fast forward to hit the new chapter.,1398384000,,496,4.030612244897959

2356225,5,B000A3DGGC,"These ten minute dvds are a must have for a working single mother of a toddler. In the mornings before fixing breakfast, preparing lunch, bathing and doing other chores prior to work, I exercise with these. I just need ten minutes. Love it. I have the pilates dvd too. Please note however that I was fit before and during my pregnancy so I did not have much weight to loose. I just maintain my fitness level.",1395360000,,408,4.381578947368421
2356226,5,B000A3DGGC,The only thing I would say is that 10 minute yoga doesn't mean beginners. I had to start on some easier less intense material as a newbie and then move up to this. Otherwise a great workout for anyone pressed for time.,1394496000,,218,4.214285714285714
2356227,5,B000A3DGGC,"This DVD has become my new favorite in my video rotation.  It is appropriate for a beginning or intermediate level of fitness.  You can always adjust your level to what is being demonstrated, either making it harder or easier.  The first section is a good warmup, the second is a great workout for legs and buns, the third section is an excellent ab workout, the fourth is a mix of stretching and leg work, and the last section is stretching.  I usually do the first 3, then the stretching section.  My legs start burning in the second section but it is not so hard that I dread doing the video.  Having 10 minute sections is crucial to my workout right now because I am kind of lacking motivation...Thinking of doing a 40 or 50 minute workout sounds hard to me right now, but with these videos I never think of my workout like that; I just focus on each 10 minute section, and they go so quickly I barely notice the time passing.  And even though they are only 10 minutes, they are effective workouts.",1393459200,,1002,4.383783783783784

2356230,2,B000A3DGGC,"This dvd is definitely not for anyone who is either a beginner, or takes yoga seriously.  So much of yoga is about breathing, and this presentation gives very little instruction on that.  Lara Hudson is strong and flexible, but does not do a good job of teaching.  She snaps from one difficult posture to another, but does a poor job of bringing her viewers along with her.",1387065600,3,373,4.537313432835821
2356231,5,B000A3DGGC,"Although I'm a relative newbie to yoga, I am old hand when it comes to the 10 Minute Solution workouts.  Lara's motivational and easy to follow instruction started me on a long term love for Pilates, and her yoga dvd does not disappoint.  It's impossible to find excuses to skip the practice when the time commitment can be as little as ten minutes.  I particularly love the yoga burn segment; it's become a constant in my workout routine.",1386979200,,439,4.602564102564102

2356233,5,B000A3DGGC,"I love this whole series. You get a great little workout that still feels challenging, but is short enough to cram into the tightest schedule. You can always do 2 or 3 in a row when time allows for a longer workout as well.  The menu settings make it super easy to string together as many of the segments together as you like into one ""program"" that will play through.  highly recommend.",1381276800,,387,4.361111111111111
2356234,4,B000A3DGGC,The only workout thatI didn't care for was the first one.  It was a waste of 10 min.  They should label it a warm up.  The last four wirkout I enjoy.  The instructor is easy to follow.  I had workouts down after one try.,1380844800,,220,3.909090909090909
2356235,2,B000A3DGGC,The instructor was fine but the moves were uninspired - too many plain step touches. Not sure if the weighted belt does much good.,1379980800,,130,4.458333333333333
2356236,5,B000A3DGGC,"I'm a bit of a workout fiend, but have never really gotten into yoga despite trying a few different classes and numerous DVDs.  Always seemed too much of a stretch session, but not much of a workout.  After trying Laura Hudson's Pilates DVDs, I decided to try her yoga DVD and I am so glad I did.  It is a great workout and seems to loosen up my lower back which has been a bit of a problem for me from all of my exercise.  Would recommend it highly.",1379980800,,450,4.022471910112359

Her routines are balanced and doing just one doesn't leave me feeling like I'm missing something. It's great!",1378684800,,281,4.035714285714286
2356238,5,B000A3DGGC,"I love this video. I recommend it to anyone who wants to start doing yoga. It is broken up into five 10-minute segments which makes it easy to do a full workout or just squeeze in some abs.

Also, I use it in combination with other 10 minute segments on youtube to have some variety in my home workout.",1377129600,,302,4.11864406779661

2356241,5,B000A3DGGC,"Lara Hudson does it again! I really enjoy her seemless yet challenging movements. I am an immediate yoga player so most of the movements are quite simple for me. But I look forward to it on the day I feel less energetic to do Jillian's. I find the exercise very refreshing and I enjoy the stretches yoga gives to the body, especially after other intense types of exercise. Highly recommend this DVD to complement other cardio, circuit training, or weight lifting DVDs you might have!!!",1374019200,,485,4.7176470588235295

2356244,5,B000A3DGGC,"I love the flexibility (haha) of this DVD - do a long or a short workout depending on your day.  The verbal cues are great, which is important because you can't always look up at the screen.

It will only play from the beginning and you have to watch the whole video or try to fast forward to find what you what--- a time waster.  Also, from what I can see of the video there is a lot of pilates included not just yoga.",1371340800,2,403,3.902439024390244
2356247,5,B000A3DGGC,"Prior to using this video, I had never done yoga before.  And I have to say, the first time that I tried this routine, it easily kicked my ass.  I was sore in places that I didn't even know I had.  But that was just proof of how out-of-shape I was at the time.

The fact that the routine is separated into 10 minute blocks is just perfect for my busy schedule, and it made it much easier for me to talk myself into exercising consistently.  (Okay, I'm tired, so I'll just do the first 10 minutes today.....Well, I might as well do the next 10 minutes........Oh, wow, I finished the whole thing.  That was quicker than I thought!)

Once I had built up strength and gotten the hang of it, I could easy power through the whole 50 minute routine every day or every other day.  And I'm not exaggerating when I say that after two weeks of using it almost every day, I lost 18 pounds.  It was incredible!

Now that I'm in better shape, I only use it about once a week or so, but overall I've lost 27 pounds (which has made a huge difference since I'm only 5'2"" tall) and I can fit back into my cute college clothes again.  :)

I can't recommend this video enough; if you use it consistently, you'll see an unbelievable difference in your body!",1370563200,,1236,4.212765957446808

2356250,4,B000A3DGGC,"I would give this an extra star except that it definitely isn't for beginners. She does go a bit quick in some of the moves, which I don't mind but might deter someone with less yoga experience. Other than needing some yoga basics before doing these routines, it has been a great DVD for me.

I was looking for something quick and simple that I can squeeze into my morning and this is doing the trick! I feel like I'm getting a good start to the day with her routines. You can also combine any of the routines, in the order you want, which is very helpful. The routines will play one after the other in the order selected. I highly recommend this DVD if you are trying to squeeze a little yoga into your day and have been to some yoga classes in the past!",1368316800,,755,4.171232876712328

I love her energy and her clarity.  Most yoga instructors go too fast or too slow.  She really separates the 5 segments well.  Just be prepared to switch your mat a few different times. Great workouts and I feel really fit when I'm don't.  I usually start out with the last segment, the Relaxation and Flexibility segment, because that segment helps me relax and get flexible to better be able to complete the yoga practice.",1367625600,,599,4.440366972477064
2356253,4,B000A3DGGC,I've gone to a couple of live classes and this will never be at that level-but it does provide 5 10 minute segments to get going at home.

2356256,4,B000A3DGGC,I love this DVD. As a beginner Yoga person I need something gentle and not too complicated! This works for me. I have other 10 minute DVD's and so far so good.

I was looking to incorporate more Yoga into my workout cycle, so I bought a few different yoga videos, including a relaxation routine because I have trouble getting to sleep.  I don't know why I even bothered buying the other videos because Lara is seriously the best instructor I've come across.  Her routines are perfect.  The workouts are a little more quickly paced than other yoga videos which I liked because I feel like they are a more intense workout.  It was still clearly a yoga workout though, focusing more on poses and stretches than repetitions.  Also, her relaxation routines are awesome (though I still feel like the relaxation in the Pilates video is the best I've done).

2356280,4,B000A3DGGC,"I really liked this video.  It was my first experience with the 10 minute solutions series and I found it so easy to use that I started trying more of them.  What I like about the 10 minute videos is that it feels like you're done really quickly, even if you do 3-4 because each seem totally different due to the instructor wearing different outfits and there's a short warm up and cool down for each one. You sort of trick yourself into thinking that it was really fast so you keep on going. But if you don't, studies have shown that even 10 minutes help! One thing I've found with this particular video is that certain steps focus on only one side, so I just try doing the opposite side for a few of the reps-working the brain as well!  I like the instructor and the moves-she's positive and the moves are easy to follow.  I would not say the moves are ridiculous as a previous reviewer stated, but they are somewhat like the ""light hits"" on certain radio stations vs. the rock stations. :) It came with a weight belt too.  I haven't tried using it with other videos but I don't know why it couldn't be used with them as well.  All in all it is a workout I return to on a regular basis.",1352419200,4,1188,4.18859649122807

Lara Hudson is awesome, gives easy to follow instructions, and keeps it short and sweet.  As an added bonus, you can combine and stack each of the workouts together to make it into a full or complete yoga work-out.  Thanks for this awesome DVD.",1341619200,,420,4.2784810126582276
2356288,5,B000A3DGGC,"I love the 10 Minute Solution series of DVDs because they provide 5 different workouts that all somehow fall under a certain theme just as dance or pilates.  With this yoga DVD, Lara Hudson leads viewers in five various workouts that each work your body a different way while still using yoga to do so.

Yoga Basics is the first workout and is a perfect intro into yoga for beginners.  Although people who have never done yoga before may just need to watch the first time, Lara goes slowly through basic yoga postures before speeding them up just a bit.  It's an excellent way for people to learn and perfect some foundational yoga moves.

Yoga for Buns and Thighs is a lower body challenge!  Using yoga moves that are much like squats and lunges, Lara leads viewers through an excellent sculpting workout.  At the same time, she manages to stretch the legs so that you won't be too sore in the morning.  Lower body is my strength, and I still feel the burn every time I do this workout.

Yoga for Abs is my favorite workout on here.  It perfectly both tones and stretches by entire abdominal region.  Lara expertly teaches some new poses that target the abs.  Once again, you won't be too incredibly sore the next morning because of the way Lara stretches while sculpting, but you should still feel your abs working through the entirety of this segment.

Yoga Burn is supposed to really get your heart rate up as you move more quickly through already-learned poses and new ones, too.  It's probably the most challenging section on the DVD.  You will do a lot of moves that flow back and forth, and you will probably be sweating by the end of this workout.

Yoga for Flexibility and Relaxation calms down your body and releases stress.  There are a few poses that I can't yet do that well because I'm not that flexible, but Lara does a great job (in all the segments) of giving beginner modifications for difficult poses.  I love this section and am usually ready to sleep by the time it's done.

Overall, I love this DVD.  I personally prefer it to the other 10 Minute Solution yoga DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-Beginners/dp/B001KJNKGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for Beginners</a>&nbsp;(also found here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-For-Beginners/dp/B0048FMKC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga For Beginners</a>).  Even though that DVD is supposedly ""for beginners,"" I think this one is more novice friendly while still presenting an excellent workout for yoga veterans.  This is one of my favorite yoga DVDs, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a diverse yoga workout!",1341532800,,2696,5.177829099307159
2356289,4,B000A3DGGC,"As with Lara Hudson's other DVDs for Pilates, I've found the 10 Minute Solutions for Yoga a great way for me to fit yoga into my busy life.  Can do all 5 segments or - if I've hiked or cycled already that day - just do the segments for abs and for flexibility (often times I start and end with the flexibility segment.)  I am a beginner at yoga and like the way Lara explains what to do, offering modifications for those with knee or back problems.  She is not too slow or fast paced, so I feel challenged, never losing interest.  It has given me the confidence to try other yoga DVDs.",1340582400,,585,4.150442477876106
2356290,4,B000A3DGGC,"I was surprised that I actually felt this workout, I expected very easy yoga, and while it isn't them most advanced, there are times when my muscles are definitely on fire. I use this (and a couple other 10 Minute Solution DVDs) in addition to Insanity which I do every day, and it's great to have a 10-minute option after 40-60 minutes of ""insane"" cardio.

My only con is the ""mood"" of the DVD. When I think of yoga, I think of low lights, quiet music, and serene ambiance. You definitely don't get that from this DVD. The trainer is very peppy, the lighting is very bright, and it just doesn't have that normal ""yoga feel."" This is something I can certainly get over for 10 minutes though.

Overall, pretty good!",1339372800,,714,4.442748091603053

I HATED to work out before I found these. I have gone from 2 of the 10 minute workouts to 6 10 minute workouts in a very short time and now I cant wait to get home from work to get my next 6 segments going. The instructors are great!! Lara Hudson and Jessica Smith are my faves!!!!! I recommend this series to people who HATE to work out.,1338249600,,495,3.8627450980392157
2356292,3,B000A3DGGC,"These exercises are effective, and the routines are easy enough to follow, although Lara Hudson does not always explain how to do the movements and poses.  I suggest watching the DVD all the way thorough before you start the exercises, especially if you are new to Yoga.  I have had a few Yoga classes, and I have Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners DVD.  The exercises on this DVD are more difficult than the beginner Yee ones.  In fact, Hudson does  some poses that I can not do at all. That said, the routines are only 10 minutes each, and they are all well worth the effort, even if you need to sit out a couple of the poses.  One good thing about Yoga is that sitting cross legged and  breathing is part of it, so you can always do that if you can't do a pose.",1334275200,,761,4.171232876712328

2356298,4,B000A3DGGC,"I'm very pleased with this DVD. I'm a beginner, although I've taken a few classes and used a couple of DVDs, - just not consistently. So my goal is to get a basic yoga routine down and to learn the poses and positions by heart. I actually had this DVD years ago, but lost it, and am glad that I returned to it. The 10 minute exercises are a perfect way to break me in - if it's anything too long, at this point, I honestly wouldn't have the motivation for it. But because you can build upon your routine by choosing more 10 minute exercises, I can set realistic goals for myself. What I'm starting to do now is to replay the first five minutes of the yoga basic routine, then go through it completely, and then choose the separate Yoga for Relaxation and Flexibility routine. So I really enjoy how much I can tailor this. If you don't have a lot of time, like myself, this is really perfect.

Sometimes, she does go fast, but I think that challenge may be needed when you're doing yoga at home - there's no real instructor to push you, after all.",1305417600,,1046,4.23

I also know that just doing one of the ten minute ones will be a great quick way to get some strength, not to mention, better circulation, leaving me feel more energized and positive. The poses aren't advanced yoga, but if you are at all out of shape, they are plenty of a workout! I am really happy with this purchase.

The warm-up is okay, the stretching sequence at the end is very disappointing and everything else is so bland I barely remember the sequence after doing the whole DVD three times.

The short segments don't really flow one into another very well, so doing the disc from start to finish doesn't leave me with a feeling that I just completed a wholesome full-body workout.

Overall, this DVD almost turned me off yoga altogether. I was lucky to find better yoga workouts elsewhere, this DVD however is not a keeper.",1300752000,,703,4.571428571428571

2356305,4,B000A3DGGC,"I've been loving yoga lately and trying out a lot of different yoga DVDs.  This is my most recent, and although I didn't like it at first because I thought it was too basic, I've learned to love it because its simplicity allows me to easily add 1 or 2 segments at the end of an extreme cardio or strength workout.  Angie Stewart is the instructor, and I've never seen her leading any other workouts.  She has a calming voice that is relaxing without being monotonous, but her cues aren't that good.  She will get her right and left sides mixed up and call out the wrong one, and she also isn't good about explaining the moves.  This lack of explaining will make the DVD a little difficult the first few times for an extreme beginner to yoga, but if you have ever done any kind of yoga before you should catch on just fine.  Like all DVDs in the ""10 Minute Solution"" brand, there are 5 10-minute segments that can be done one-at-a-time or mixed together.

Energizing Flow Yoga - This workout is meant to invigorate you and perk you up at any time in the day.  I didn't find that it did that immensely, although I do feel some energy after doing this section.  Moves included are: breathing, plies, cat/cow stretch, a move where you flow from child's pose to cobra and back again, downward facing dogs, some crescent lunges, chair poses, a hamstring stretch with the strap, and more.

Yoga for Strength and Toning - This section is supposed to sculpt your muscles while stretching them at the same time.  I wasn't sore the next day, but while doing this, I was definitely working, especially in my legs.  Some yoga poses in this segment are: sun salutations, crescent lunges, downward dogs, planks, knee crunches while in plank, a back exercise facedown on floor, a side plank on your knee with a leg lift, a tricep stretch with the strap, and more.

Core Strength - If you want an effective ab workout that isn't too intense, then this will be great for you.  It really works your abs enough to make them sore if they aren't in shape, but if they are in shape, they will still get worked to a lesser degree.  Moves included: breathing, side bends with strap and then cat/cow on the floor to warm up abs, some extensions and pull-ins with the knee and arm while on hands and knees, some oblique crunches (strange in yoga), boat poses, planks, and side planks, stretches for abs and arms, and other ab-oriented exercises (some of which, like the crunches, don't seem to be really yoga-ish).

Yoga for Balance and Flexibility - Intended to improve your coordination and create limber muscles, this section has stretching exercises that will challenge your balance at the same time.  You start out with a swan dive down and up then move onto moves such as warriors, triangles, a lean forward on one leg, a roll down using the strap, a boat pose with the strap, a lean forward while stretching the hamstrings with the strap, twists, and 1 or 2 other poses.

Stress Relief Yoga - Finally, this segment provides yoga that stretches out your body while relaxing you.  Every time I complete this segment, I feel cleansed and ready for bed.  You start off this segment with bends forward with a flat back then do yoga stretches including a hurdler's stretch with the strap, a leg extension to the ceiling while lying on your back with the strap, a quad stretch while lying on your side, some bends from side-to-side while sitting down, and more.

Like I've already mentioned, this DVD comes with a strap, which is very much like a belt.  The thing is, while it is helpful in some of the poses in order to get deeper and feel a better stretch, it is unnecessary as you could easily use a towel.  Also, the strap is used for only about 1/8 of the entire exercises done; it's not a large part of the yoga practice at all.  I find it to be unnecessary for this DVD, and it makes the DVD way too expensive.  I love the DVD and recommend it highly, but I recommend getting just it and not the strap, even if that means getting it used.  The strap is an additional cost that is frankly not worth it.  But, like I've said, the DVD is fantastic for beginners and intermediates to yoga, and I absolutely recommend it!",1297987200,8,4196,4.47244094488189

2356307,4,B000A3DGGC,"QUESTION FOR OTHER DVD USERS: I finally purchased this dvd because I found out you could personalize your workouts. However, once I've completed the personalized workout, it won't let me run it again. Every time I try, it says ""Congratulations. You have completed your personalized workout.""

Even when I go back into the main menu and try to re-create the workout, it gives me this message. The only way to do another personalized workout is to remove the dvd and insert it again. And then sit through all of the various warnings.

Is anyone else having this problem? Do I have a defective DVD?

[...]

I really like this! I've only done the first 10 minutes. I'm a beginner (I've taken 1 ""basics"" class and 2 ""Mommy & Me"" classes before), and I find this challenging. I'm pretty out of shape (just had a baby, and I've never really had an exercise routine), and the first 10 minutes kick my butt. I've been doing 10 minutes of yoga every day, now, for almost 2 weeks and it's gotten progressively easier. Once I can do the whole 10 minute routine easily, I'll move on to the next 10 minutes and work my way up to the full DVD.

To mix it up, I got another 10 minute Yoga DVD (a beginner one), and I find it to be MUCH less challenging... which I don't like. This one is much more invigorating and harder to do. (I still mix it up, though, so that on the days I'm tired, I do the beginner one) I also find the woman on this DVD to be much less irritating than the guy in my other one and I like that she always tells you when to breath. (in the other DVD, the guy will say ""Inhale, bring your arms together... now do this. Now do that. Now do this,"" and he never says when to exhale and he won't mention inhaling again for a while.)

This instructor says ""Inhale, bring your hands together. Exhale, lower your body. Inhale reach up"" etc...

I like it because it helps me to focus on my breathing.

One other tip: This is on Netflix, so I just stream it for free every day.

I'm now a busy mom and the idea of having short workouts to get into sounds like just the thing for me. So I started by trying this Yoga workout...

It's fantastic. I'm not new to yoga (and, as a caveat, I must add that a total beginner may be a bit frustrated by this workout, since she moves pretty fast; it seems that a bit of familiarity with yoga is kind of a prerequisite), but I haven't done yoga workouts regularly for a long time. This workout really worked me! My heart rate got up, my circulation got really going, and I got that wonderful feeling that comes over me after a yoga workout, like everything is well stretched and relaxed, yet well strengthened. Her instruction is clear and precise, with no annoying ""chattiness"", and the combinations are well put together to make the most of each 10 minutes. Again, keep in mind, that it does move fast, but I was impressed at how substantial each segment really is. They truly mean it when they say that you can get a lot from the 10 minutes! However, doing all 5 at once is a stellar workout! For a DVD workout that is 5 years old, it is still very relevant and not outdated seeming at all.

I can see myself getting a lot of excellent workout time with this DVD, and I'm very excited to try many others in the 10 Minute Solution series. This is a super option for me someone like me whose only option is to work out at home.",1282867200,,1795,4.276470588235294
2356316,4,B000A3DGGC,"I have been doing this dvd for about a month and really like it.  I just do the ten minute segments and alternate between the buns & thighs, abs and yoga burn.  I don't do the basics because I already have yoga experience.
Lara Hudson is pleasant to listen to and the poses are easy to follow.",1276905600,,293,4.12280701754386
2356317,5,B000A3DGGC,"Great for a beginner, or intermediate yoga user. Quick way to get a nice stretch and strengthening in. Use the video for a quick, 10 minutes or the whole video for 50 minutes.",1271203200,,175,4.333333333333333
2356318,5,B000A3DGGC,"I purchased this DVD after taking a few Yoga classes.  The classes were great, but something that I could not afford to continue.  I have had two spinal column surgeries and Yoga has been recommended to me by several doctors I have seen.

This DVD is great because it is broken down into five 10 minute sessions.  You have the option to pick and choose the routines and combine them for a personalized yoga workout.  I especially like the fact that if I only have 10 minutes, I can do that portion of the DVD without going through all the routines.

This is an excellent DVD for all ages!",1270771200,,588,4.348623853211009
2356319,3,B000A3DGGC,"10 Minute Solution Yoga by Lara Hudson is fifty-four minutes and was released on DVD on September 6, 2005. This video is more geared to people who are in shape, flexible, and thin. Since I don't fall into any of the above categories, this felt more like an intermediate yoga video. The main reason I bought this was to replace my VHS version of Denise Austin's Hit the Spot Easy Tone video; look likes I am going to hold on to that one a little bit longer then I expected. The DVD is broken down to five different sections:

Yoga Basics-Start with three breaths sitting down and then go into mountain pose. Yoga poses in order of appearance: Sun Salutation, high plank, low plank, Upward facing dog, downward facing dog, prayer pose, and Warrior One pose. Basically you are doing the Sun Salutation repeated times.

Yoga for Buns & Thighs-Start standing up with you hands in prayer pose. Yoga poses in order of appearance: Chair pose, high plank, low plank, upward facing dog, Downward facing dog, Warrior One pose, Warrior Two pose, and child pose. There are two other poses\movements that she does not mention by name.

Yoga for Abs-Starting down. Lara's V-sit exercises may be difficult for those people not in shape. Yoga poses in order of appearance: leg lifts, boat pose, table-top pose, snake pose, and child pose. Yoga for Abs segment in my opinion is difficult for to do if you are out of shape. If you are healthy, but not have workout in a long while, you might be able to do this segment.

Yoga Burn-This routine starts in mountain pose. Yoga poses in order of appearance: high plank, low plank, Upward facing dog, Downward facing dog, Warrior One pose, Warrior Two pose, side plank, child pose, camel pose flow, prayer pose, Up dog Down dog pose flow, chair pose flow, and roll down. Yoga Burn is done at a quicker pace.

Yoga for Flexibility & Relaxation-Start sitting down in the balance ankle pose. Yoga poses in order of appearance: side bending stretch, seated spine twist, bridge pose, hamstring stretch, and inner thigh stretch. When it comes to the hamstring and inner thigh stretch, a towel, belt, or strap may be needed for those you cannot reach their toes.

The first two I had no problem keeping up with and then came Yoga for Abs for which I could only do half of the segment. Yoga Burn is done at a faster pace does require some arm strength to hold a pose for about a minute. When Yoga for Flexibility & Relaxation came on I felt I was participating in an advance game of Twister in the first half. Also I felt that Lara should have told her audience that a towel or strap might be needed for the leg portion of the segment. 10 Minute Solution Yoga by Lara Hudson gets a C- for not putting some kind of warning label on it.

2356320,5,B000A3DGGC,Another 10-Minute Solution success! Lara Hudson does a great job of walking the viewer through the basics of yoga. The sequences she puts together are wonderful for stretching out and de-stressing. Perfect for anyone who sits for the better part of the day.,1269475200,,257,5.0
2356321,5,B000A3DGGC,I love her!! I have 3 of the video's she is in. She isn't annoying!,1268870400,,67,3.533333333333333
2356322,3,B000A3DGGC,I just got a simliar product today but haven't yet got to use it...same family of products except I got the one with the yoga mat and then another 10 minutes workout vid with two resistance bands. Bought both at Target today in the clearance area for $3.74 each. Thought it was an awesome deal!,1267142400,,294,4.363636363636363

2356324,3,B000A3DGGC,"I got the dvd and strap last weekend.  I'm new to yoga and some of the poses I could not do, but with time I might improve.  The downward dog pose hurts my toes and trying to move my feet to my hands was next to impossible.  Some of the moves remind me of Pilates.  It's all right, but the instructor could go a bit slower.  That's my feeling.",1265500800,2,343,3.9130434782608696
2356325,2,B000A3DGGC,"I've done other TMS workouts and really enjoyed them, so I thought I'd try yoga. First off, unless you have never, ever done yoga before, Yoga Basics is a throw-away. It's just a series of sun salutations, almost identical to ones you do in the later sections. Yoga Burn was the only truely enjoyable section, although it didn't fully come through on its claim to raise my heartrate. It did you up a bit, but not enough to burn anything.  Yoga for Flexibility was fine, TMS is not really known for their stretch routines. In both of the toning workouts I was distracted by the instructor. Lara is clearly a pilates teachers who quickly learned some yoga postures for this video. This does give me hope for her pilates videos at least. Overall, I think that this is a yoga workout for people who don't like yoga.",1258156800,7,811,4.517006802721088
2356326,4,B000A3DGGC,"I already have one of the ten minute solution yoga workouts and it is slightly challenging for a beginner, but I'm really glad I ordered this one when I did, because I had just reached the point of needing to be challenged again.  Probably for someone who does yoga all the time this wouldn't be that hard, but for me, as I am learning, it is a perfect next step.  There are a couple of exercises I'm not sure I'll ever be able to do, but I'm having fun trying.  I love the ten minute solution format and have many of the videos.  It works well for this one as well.  I like to mix and match my segments with all my 10-Minute solution videos.  Sometimes I just use Lara's ab workout or buns workout with other easier videos.  Sometimes, if I have time, I work through the whole video.  Either way, it's enjoyable.  For a good, short yoga workout, the yoga burn segment is great.  I like her stretches, too.  The last segment is one I combine with other videos as a cool-down, stretchout.  I find her manner pleasant and her instructions easy to follow, and she does offer alternate positions for the harder poses.  I feel that at the rate I'm progressing and the amount of time I have to exercise everyday, that this video will be useful to me for a long time.",1255564800,,1260,4.288135593220339
2356327,5,B000A3DGGC,"Lara Hudson is a well known instructor specialized in Pilates. Hatha Yoga in most of its versions like Vinyasa, share many mechanics of movement with Pilates. I practiced Yoga before but been out of it for many years. I was looking for a quick pick me up DVD so that I would have no excuses for practicing Yoga 3 times a week. This DVD is excellent, thankfully I came to it open minded. Lara is very easy to understand and shows amazing form and flow in her movements. This is not a begginers dvd. The 10 minute title migth mislead some buyers. There are 5 extremely efficient routines here but I would rate them quite challenging for some coming new to Yoga. This is not a profound study of Yoga and its link to body mind and soul. I knew it when i got it. For that you are better finding a study group or a recognize Yoga center like Sivananda. My hope is that by getting into de physical part of Yoga with the help of this DVD, I will wake up again my interest into the more profound parts of Yoga like meditation.",1254614400,,1017,4.220512820512821
2356328,4,B000A3DGGC,"This was the 1st 10-minute solution DVD I ever bought, just because I was getting bored with the two yoga DVDs I already owned.  I have to admit that, the first time I did it, I didn't like it very much because it seemed very easy and all the poses seemed very rushed.  However, I have turned back to this DVD after I experienced an overuse injury in my lower back and cannot do any high-impact exercises; I am now seeing this DVD with new eyes, and I have to say that I enjoy it very much.

The good:

1) Some very nice, easy-to-do poses.  I can't stand a DVD where the learning curve is too steep.
2) The 5 10-minute segments go by SO fast, before you know it you've done the entire workout.
3) The variety of the routines is very refreshing, and you get a good solid beginner's/lower intermediate workout if you do all 5 segments.
4) If I don't have time for 50 minutes, I like being able to pick and choose the segments, and design a 20- or 30-minute workout.
5) The instructor is not annoying, but encouraging.  She knows what she's doing (call me crazy, but I like that in an instructor).

Needs improvement:

1) You do have to have some basic knowledge of yoga poses, because the instructor sometimes just says the name of the pose and then does it with no ""preview"" of the pose.  Her cueing could also be much better.
2) The poses go by *very* quickly; I often felt like I was trying to catch up to her.  However, I'm sure that will go away the more I do this workout.
3) It comes with a yoga strap, but I feel that it wasn't used very much or to its fullest potential.

If you want more of a power yoga workout or you want an intermediate/advanced yoga workout, this is probably not the DVD for you.  However, seeing this through the eyes of someone who still wants a workout but doesn't want to aggravate an injury while it's healing, this DVD is excellent at providing a low-impact workout that still makes you feel like you did some work AND some good for your body.",1246060800,4,1978,4.245333333333333
2356329,5,B000A3DGGC,"This DVD is great.  It is really a great way to unwind after a long day or even if you are feeling irritable.  And 10 minutes is just enough time to accomplish your goal.  If you are busy, but want to get some ""me"" time in, this DVD is perfect.",1241308800,,244,3.84
2356330,5,B000A3DGGC,"I like this yoga workout, is more of a workout, with pilates moves in the abs part. Very good for yoga beginners, the instructor explain basic poses and the series Sun salutation.",1239148800,,179,4.625
2356331,4,B000A3DGGC,"I liked this video but the 1st 10 minute segment whipped me. I am not new to yoga but it has been several years since I took a class. I bought this video so I could enjoy yoga again. I think this is not exactly what I was looking for.
Regardelss of that, the instructor is clear but fast. She does not give you the 'soft' or 'easy' poses but the full-fledged whoop-your-bootie pose. I was sweating bullets at the end of the first segment and had to stop.
It is definately a work-out. It's flowing but intense. I was looking for something calm and relaxing with lots of breathing in the poses. This is not for you if you are seeking the same. Be prepared to work hard with this one.",1237161600,,681,4.166666666666667
2356332,5,B000A3DGGC,"My daughter inlaw gave me this kit for my 53rd birthday knowing I wanted to do Yoga again.  So after 2 months, she challenged me to a daily 30 minute workout for the month of March.  I love this workout video, and most of all the way you can design your own workout to fit time constraints and energy needs.  I am proud to say I have made the time to do a daily workout!  My grandaughters, all under the age of 15 have been doing a workout as well.  I find the moves very fitting to your personal level of ability.  I also have done Rodney Yee, and love his workouts too but find the strength level especially  challenging for beginners. Angie's dvd is a good place for anyone at any level to begin their personal inhome workouts.  Challenge a buddy and get going!!!",1236643200,6,766,4.23448275862069
2356333,3,B000A3DGGC,"I got this at Walmart for a cheaper price (strap included), just wanted to point that out. I wanted to get a similar video with Randy Yee (sp?) but this seemed like a better bargain. I may consider ordering one through Amazon because there's some available with low prices, but I digress.

  Anyway, I enjoy this video for vaious reasons. First, I like how all of the workouts are 10 minutes long. The instructor gives you the most important exercises in a simple, succinct manner that's very helpful. I also like how you can personalize your workout by making a mini playlist of the mini exercises to your liking. That way you don't have to click on another video after the last one ended. Another reviewer said that s/he didn't like it because most of the exercises are the same. I agree and disagree. There are some poses that are routine for all of the exercises but I think that's a good thing to remember the poses, to stretch the muscles, etc. ONe thing I must warn those who consider buying this product, beware of the Core Strength Training one. It's basically the most intense workout, in my opinion, because it focuses on your abs. There's a pose that I could never do no matter HOW HARD I tried (and believe me I did try). So, don't say I didn't warn you.

Another little thing that I didn't like was that sometimes the instructor goes too fast, but that's probably just me not trying to catch my breath and trying to do the pose correctly.

Though certainly not a master of yoga, I've tried it in high school for the first time. I was thinking about getting a DVD that was for toning the body and was meant for Intermediate members but bailed because of the price, and because I thought I might hurt myself, so I bought this. While I was familiar with most of the poses, this DVD was challenging in a good way, and I assure you that it'll be challenging in a good way for you too.",1235865600,12,1893,4.381766381766382
2356334,5,B000A3DGGC,"This is the first video that I ever used for yoga.  All the movements give a great stretch and really engage all muscles.  I would suggest this video to anyone who does not have a lot of time to work out in the day because the personalization of the workouts are great! Also, the strap allows stretching more in the muscles than I could by myself.  I have already been able to see results in my legs and butt and it has only been two weeks since I have received the video.",1235606400,8,472,4.108695652173913

The different 10 minute workouts are great for my schedule.  I usually just do 1 or 2 - It's challenging enough, but easy to follow.  I have definitely noticed a physical and mental difference in myself - and it's helped improve my posture too!
My roommate recently moved out for the summer and I couldn't handle not having this DVD anymore and had to get my own copy!
I'm sure there are other great yoga DVDs out there - but I'm a happy with this one :)",1213142400,,629,4.08130081300813

2356339,5,B000A3DGGC,"This DVD contains quite the whole body workout. If you think yoga is just stretching & relaxation, think again. This one is more about building & toning muscles.

2356340,3,B000A3DGGC,"Although it is decent, if you want yoga, look for a yoga dvd, from a yoga teacher. I like Lara Hudson in her Pilates series, she also looks better in those. Many Yoga dvds have expellent filming as well. The studio backround is not nice. And even if exercises are almost ok, a yoga teacher would convey some more things that make yoga so special.

She takes you right into it, giving you enough time ot master some poses and get a good workout, without bogging you down with too much repetition or talking.  I had no background in pilates or yoga before trying this series of dvds, and I now feel really confident and am in much better shape.",1187136000,,425,4.578947368421052
2356345,5,B000A3DGGC,"First, this is a very EASY TO NAVIGATE DVD that lets you CHOOSE which 10 minute Yoga exercise you want. Each mini session is just 10 minutes, a plus when you are short on time! This Yoga is just right, not too hard and not at all boring. In fact, after I did each session, I felt like I really got a good workout and yet I was so relaxed! This has 5 sessions, each at just 10 minutes:
1) Yoga Basics - This is JUST RIGHT for stretching, postures and breathing, a great way to start the day is just 10 minutes!
2) Buns & Thighs - Just the right level for a good leg and buns session. I could feel the difference after just a couple of sessions! Loved this one.
3) ABS - Not a boring ABS like some I have tried. Great that is is Yoga and not the regular ABS exercise. This kept me going and still felt great after the session ended. Just after a few sessions, I can SEE and FEEL a big difference in my ABS.
4) Yoga Burn - This is FASTER and more intense all over session for the total body. I do this every other day.
5) Flexibility & Relaxation - Great STRESS BUSTER after a long day at work. Sometimes I use this for a tonic to refresh and go out for the evening, other times, I save it for right before bed. Either way, it gets my muscles to relax and knock out any kinks in them from the day! *This is my favorite session on this DVD!
***Just so you will know*** This is a SUPERB BEGINNER DVD, and you can choose one of the five to do for just 10 minutes or as many as you want, the menu lets you customize the Yoga session. If I could give this one 10 stars, I would! *And all of the 10 minute line are wonderful!",1185840000,4,1616,3.9148936170212765
2356346,3,B000A3DGGC,its nothing personal with the dvd i just found this type of yoga really boring and slow. i much prefer her ten minute pilates dvd.  the dvd format is really good though as it gives you four 10 minutes exercises to do at your discretion and the option to order your exercises in preference as a personal menu.  haven't used it much but will be a great back dvd for exercise if im stuck for time.,1179705600,3,394,4.171052631578948
2356347,5,B000A3DGGC,"I love this DVD and I love Lara, the instructor. I adore the music and the workouts are great. To the person who said these run over ten minutes --- not so. A few run just a few seconds over but they stay right at ten minutes.

That said, I love the fact you can build your own workout with the press of a button on the DVD player. You can do just one workout, or two or all of them. If you need to work on your abs, you might select the Basic and the Abs, for example. You can, if you choose, personalize your workout. That's so cool.

The music is what I'd call New Age --- very nice and motivating. And loud enough to enjoy yet not so loud as to disturb.

Lara has a nice voice. She's friendly without being giddy. She's a good instructor.

The workouts are challenging. They are vinyasa, which means they flow. They are similar to the workouts you get with Baron Baptiste and Byran Kest.

Vinyasa is a breath-synchronized movement. When used to describe a style of yoga, Vinyasa means that poses will flow from one to another in conjunction with the breath. It's such a wonderful way to move and to feel at peace with the world and yourself.

Lara doesn't really give modifications. But those of us who do Yoga know to use them and even a beginner should know to work within his or her own limitations and not to try and do what someone else does. Yoga, like all exercise, should be done to your own degree.

I highly recommend this DVD to ""anyone"" at any level of Yoga. It is a real workout and you should get a lot from it. And you can personalize it to meet your needs and the time you have available. I wish all DVDs and all workouts were as good as this one!

Do yourself a big favor and buy it!",1176076800,10,1704,4.126888217522659
2356348,5,B000A3DGGC,"I hesitated to practice yoga since the last time I joined a yoga class years ago. It was too slow, too hard, and too boring. I didn't feel like I got any exercise. None of the poses made sense if not alreay impossible to do.

BUT!! With this DVD, it changed my viewpoint downside UP. I started with 10 mins for the basic. I felt it was hard, but challenging hard, not like impossible. So, I felt motivated. Then, the 2nd time, I tried mixing the basic with buns and thighs. I couldn't believe slow moves with a lot of deep breathing could get my heart rate going like I went jogging (I was a fan of aerobic exercise in general. I believe sweats and shortness of breath are the signs I have exercised). Then, I tried it all (yoga for abs, yoga burn, yoga for flexibility and relaxation). I mixed and match to any 10, 20, ..., 50 mins I want to.

Yoga got it all for my definitions of exercise WITHOUT me feeling super-tired and could barely do anything afterwards. It's low intensity so my legs/joints do not get hurt doing yoga. A week after, I noticed I slept better, fell asleep fast, woke up refreshed, I did not need that many hours of sleep to feel rested (I now go to bed at 10/11pm, wake up at 5am! with full energy and feel too lazy to sleep more :) ).

The instructor makes yoga interesting, challenging, and not boring. Her voice is not too soft (you know what I mean if you've seen FitTV Namaste Yoga). She doesn't make my exercise feel like a nap time. I now in the 5th week of it, and I'm getting better at every poses (not perfect yet because my legs and back are not that flexible from not stretching enough for years and years).

Give it a try. You will know the different in yourself. Your weights, your shape, your size, your mood, your attitude will all improve! The DVD makes this all possible. Now, I'm 5lbs lighter and the weights are going off slowly, but surely.

For those who already know Yoga (those non-beginners) might not like this DVD because its levels are towards beginner with good explanations of poses' names, how to breath in each and every move, etc. It's a great basic that will last with me for at least several months to come.

By the way, the instructor is not a super-skinny woman. She is lean, yet got curves. She doesn't make me feel jealous or wonder how on earth one would ever want to be like .... (those other exercise maniacs).

I also bought her Rapid Results Pilates. I tried twice. I liked it ok, but I liked yoga more. Another one I bought is 10 min solution: Fat Blasting Dance Mix. I thought I would like it the most because it's the kind of exercise I was used to all my life. I tried it twice. It was as good as expected.

2356349,4,B000A3DGGC,"I purchased 10 Minute Yoga to follow Lara Hudson's 10 Minute Pilates. Both dvds are good core workouts. 10 Minute Yoga is moderately more challenging and faster paced routines. The Yoga relaxation routine is more enjoyable and better for stretching than the other dvd. Easy to learn, no yoga background needed.",1168819200,4,310,5.098039215686274
2356350,4,B000A3DGGC,"This is a great DVD, and if you're anything like me- you will use it often.  I love being able to get a quick (10-30 min.) session in before work.  That's all you need to feel strong and flexible!  If I want a good workout and to feel more slim and toned- I do yoga burn, buns & thighs, then abs.  Lara is great.  She is not annoying, keeps you breathing, and challanges you.  Great place to start or to get quick sessions in as an intermediate.",1166227200,4,445,4.057471264367816
2356351,5,B000A3DGGC,I love using this DVD to exercise at home; I can use just one routine and still feel like at least I did some exercise even though it was only ten minutes.  Mostly I've used the Abs and Flexibility sections.  The Flexibility & Relaxation routine is very soothing.,1162512000,3,263,4.458333333333333
2356352,1,B000A3DGGC,"This is not what I would call yoga.  It has much to much of a workout mentality to it and it does the same poses over and over again.  When the instructor modifies poses, there is no one to demonstrate the modifications and some of the transitions between poses seem dangerous to me.  I do yoga videos a lot and this is not one I like at all.  I will not be doing it again.  This has none of the soul of yoga.  I much prefer my Crunch Yoga DVD with the two workouts on it.",1156118400,10,472,3.8645833333333335
2356353,5,B000A3DGGC,"I agree with the reviewer who described this as more of a yoga workout.  I thought the abs section was very effective.  The boat pose variations really targeted the lower abs.  The bun and thigh section was fast paced and my legs were shaking after the chair poses, crescent pose and warrior varations.  I liked that Lara told you the name of each pose.  Yoga burn was tough for me, especially the ending move where you sit,roll backwards and then stand up all without using your hands.  I had to cheat on that one! I'm not very flexible and I found all the sections to be a little challenging.  The basics and relaxation segments would be good for beginners because Lara moves a little slower here. Overall, the instruction was clear and Lara has a nice, calm demeanor.",1155081600,5,770,4.536231884057971
2356354,5,B000A3DGGC,"This was my first yoga experience.  Overall I enjoyed it very much.  I had to make quite a few modifications for poses/moves that were too difficult for me, but I kind of appreciated that because it gives me something to work for.  Otherwise, I might get tired or bored pretty quickly.  This poses a challenge and clear goal for me to ahcieve.  I'm glad I bought it and look forward to mastering it.",1152576000,5,399,4.410958904109589
2356355,5,B000A3DGGC,"I haven't opened it as of yet, as I'm busy packing to move....I figured if I use it once for 10 minutes, it basically only cost me the dollar a minute to be trained to do Yoga!",1142726400,,176,3.7837837837837838

8073936,4,B000A3DGGC,"I like this.  I have 3-4 different 10 minute solution DVDs, mostly with Jessica Smith - who I also like.  I needed a yoga DVD so I could get some stretching into my 10 minute morning work out.  This one is good.  The Yoga Abs section is particularly notable -- she comes up with ab work that's different from my other 10 minute ab workouts.  It's slightly Pilates-like and novel enough that I don't feel like I'm doing the same old thing.",1489190400,,438,4.2926829268292686

8073940,4,B000A3DGGC,The DVD content is good but the DVD I got doesn't work properly. It won't let me select multiple work outs to mix up my routine. Only plays from beginning to end so you have to do work outs sequentially or fast forward.,1484784000,,219,4.116279069767442

8073942,5,B000A3DGGC,This workout is great. It is easy to follow along with and is great for a busy working person. This allows for me to get in my yoga in only 10 minutes. I like that this video has 5 different workout. I really enjoy the back one back it helps my bad back. I would recommend to the others.,1481846400,,287,3.8813559322033897
