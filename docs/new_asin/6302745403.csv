The film credits roll in a reverse direction, as if to symbolize this movie. The film opens on a highway at night, a woman is running down the road looking for help. A sports car stops to pick her up, she is crying. A police patrol is looking for a woman who escaped from an asylum! Mike Hammer tells them the woman is his wife. Later a big black sedan cuts them off and captures them. Christina is tortured to death (off screen), then she and Hammer are put in his car which is pushed off the cliff. When Hammer recovers he is questioned by the ""I.C.C."" about what happened. Hammer is a PI who specialized in divorce actions with his beautiful secretary Velda. Upon his return to his office we see a 1950's telephone answering machine. Then Hammer goes to meet a client. He learned the name and address of Christina's roommate. (We hear a trolley in the street.)

Someone sent a gift car for Hammer. He looks it in the mouth and removes the extra features. Hammer then learns about some new people, and finds out more. He visits a rich man who tells him to drop the investigation. But trouble is his business, and he continues to look for something. Christina's friend Lily is afraid, and asks Mike to hide her. Then Mike's friend Nick is murdered. Velda talks about how some people are always searching for the ""great whatsit""! Mike visits a bar to drown his sorrows. A message told him that Velda was abducted. At the office Mike is abducted and taken for a ride. They give him sodium pentothal to get him to talk. But Mike escapes from this trap. Later Mike finds a key and figures out where it belongs, and finds a very hot secret.

When Mike goes to visit Captain Pat Murphy he gets a big surprise. Another body had turned up. Mike goes to visit an art gallery after hours, and finds a connection to the leader of the pack. There is an exciting ending after Gabriella opens the forbidden box. [Did ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" copy this ending?] The director used a number of odd camera angles for this film set in Los Angeles. It is a sort of low budget film whose violent action is played down and off-screen. [Does it remind you of some TV programs from the 1950's? The search for a missing object may remind you of ""The Maltese Falcon"", a better novel and film.]",1423526400,,2296,4.384976525821596
