2509400,5,B000E8M0SI,I am biased as i am a big Johnny Cash Fan but  I enjoyed this show. The acting isn't all that bad. It is a light movie you don't have to think too hard to enjoy it. If you don't like Johnny you will not like this movie.,1189296000,4,219,3.5625
2509401,4,B000E8M0SI,"Because I'm such a pool freak, I can get into any billiards movie. Although this movie had a decent plot, it didn't show as much pool playing footage as I expected. Definitely NOT a ""Pool Hall Junkies"" type movie.",1184630400,5,213,4.487179487179487
2509402,5,B000E8M0SI,Great film. Johnny Cash as the Baron. Great story and great acting by Cash. If you love Cash buy this,1179014400,2,101,4.1
2509403,5,B000E8M0SI,"The acting was so, so in this movie, but I have always liked Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, so it was nice to see them in this movie together. Also as a Christian and a pool player (and founder of ChristianPoolPlayers), it was nice to see a movie with no cursing and that had a theme on playing pool in tournaments and not as a hustler, as hustling seems to be a given in other pool movies.  I also liked that this movie had one of Johnny's lines say, ""Hustling is stealing"".  So I say get the movie enjoy it and then enjoy some wholesome pool.",1170979200,11,547,4.102803738317757

2509408,4,B000E8M0SI,I bought this for rainy day viewing and I still have not had an opportunity to view it. But Johnny Cash and pool . . . it has to be at least entertaining.,1395705600,,154,3.696969696969697
2509409,4,B000E8M0SI,I really liked this movie but I'm a Cash fan. If your not a fan you might not like it as it is an old movie. It does have some twist to it.,1394064000,,139,3.242424242424242
2509410,3,B000E8M0SI,Mr Cash kind of just acted like himself with a pool cue as a prop.  It was written for TV.  The Man in Black saves the day.  Redeems himself to his kid and June Carter Cash.  I recommend this movie it was fun.,1369267200,,209,3.7906976744186047

2509413,3,B000E8M0SI,"An okay clean movie, not one of the Cash's better ones. Not enough pool shots for my liking, unlike The Hustler and Color of Money.",1303171200,3,131,4.28
2509414,1,B000E8M0SI,Bought it because of Johnny Cash.  Would not give it as a gift to my worst enemy....,1262822400,2,84,3.9411764705882355
2509415,5,B000E8M0SI,"I have looked high and low for this movie for years. I'm the little kid writing on the chalkboard in the beginning of the movie. No one anywhere had this movie but anyway the movie with the CD is a great combo. If you haven't seen any of Johnny Cash's films you got to see this one. June Carter Cash and Claud Aikens is in it also. This film was a memorable moment in my life. Johnny, June and Claude were all very down to earth nice people. Thanks Amazon!",1232841600,6,456,4.0777777777777775

I never heard of this movie, but loved another movie he did, so I chanced buying it. I am glad I did. It's a wonderful and heartfelt  story, with June Carter Cash as his estranged wife and Johnny as a professional pool shooter.  Ya just Gotta See It!!",1413158400,2,377,4.208333333333333
