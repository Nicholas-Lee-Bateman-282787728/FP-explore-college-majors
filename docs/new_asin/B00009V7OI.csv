1891278,4,B00009V7OI,"I used to own the Two - Disc R3 version of this film and decided to get the R1 Digipack release for distinctive packaging and to re-view this classic this coming Xmas (a tradition of some sort). to my surprise, the R1 transfer is the same with R3 release. the only noticeable difference is the transition of menus which in R1 is animated.  the audio-video transfer is average for this classic. Read DD4.0 and not so pristine video presentation.

nevertheless, this is an interesting addition to one's collection... a film about challenging traditional family values in a ""discomforting"" environment.. in a two disc digipak.

still hoping for a better transfer this year...",1109462400,,672,4.982142857142857
1891279,5,B00009V7OI,"It's very hard to know where to begin when praising both this movie as well as the double ""digi-pack"" DVD of it. Julie Andrews gives a very strong performance as Maria, a misfit nun who is turned out into the world by the Reverand Mother to see if she really wants to be a nun. Her singing range of  4 octaves is beautifully displayed at the end of the song ""Do-Re-Mi."" Christopher Plummer is well cast as the Captain von Trapp who is not too likeable--yet is charmed into being a man again be Maria's infectious inner and outer beauty. The rest of the cast is well chosen and the viewer is treated to a rare screen performance by Marni Nixon; Marni dubbed vocals for Deborah Kerr in The King and I and she did dubbing for My Fair Lady and South Pacific as well. The second disc contains two fantastic documentaries about Salzburg, the city in Austria where many scenes were filmed, as well as the production and history of the film. The history of the real-life von Trapp family on whom the story is based is well laid out with revealing interviews from family members themselves. In addition, the cinematography is superlative. Very honestly, I cried at the end of the film and I NEVER cry--it's THAT touching! This is NOT a film to be sneered at as being sugary sweet. It's a classic tale of good triumphing over evil as the von Trapp family flees Austria to escape the Nazis.(...)",1086480000,8,1384,4.470355731225297
1891280,5,B00009V7OI,"I was one of those people that would never give this movie a chance . All I kept thinking was the NBC commercial with Julie Andrews running on a hill singing ""the hills are alive with the sound of music."" How dreadful the prospect of ever seeing this.
I initially bought this for my wife, who loved it, and because of this kind gesture, I was forced to watch it. To my suprise, I loved it. It's not a corny musical but a musical with romance, humor & suspence. What more can you ask for? I loved it so much I bought it on DVD for superior sound and picture quality, which I got with this DVD.
I have to thank the ""Sound of Music."" I have become more open to many other older movies.
The acting is superb by the main characters. The children's acting is off at times, but I don't exprect much from kids from that era. No big deal. And yes great songs that will stick in your head long after you have watched it.",1073433600,3,910,4.089385474860335
1891281,5,B00009V7OI,"This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever made!  The Sound of Music has a combination of wonderful cast (Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, Charmian Carr etc., etc., etc.,) It also has stunning views of Austria and is one of the most romantic love stories.  I have seen many movies and musicals and not one of them inspired me like the Sound of Music.  The DVD is great with lots of extras just like the Five Star edition.  Its packaging is beautiful and the widescreen version of it is amazing.  The Sound of Music is a must for anyone that ever set foot on this planet.  This is not America's most loved and cherished film for no reason.  Everyone needs to see it at least once and I would strongly suggest buying this stunning classic.  R&H's last musical was their greatest.  The Sound of Music is packed with wonderful songs, everyone one of them classics, known around the world.  ""Edelweiss"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""So Long, Farewell"", ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""The Sound of Music""... these songs are all classics that will continue to bring a smile to chidren's and adult's faces for years to come.  There is something about it that just makes you smile and watch it over and over again.  The wonderful morals of love conquers all, and what trusting in God can do ring loud and clear. Whoever came up with the slogan ""The Happiest Sound in all the world,"" back in 1965 when the movie came out was definatly right.  This movie still is enormously popular even today and it proves that the Sound of Music clearly is still, and forever will be, ""The Happiest Sound in all the World!""",1072051200,2,1600,4.591549295774648

Their travels around the world and eventually coming to my home state of Vermont.and living in Stowe.

1891302,5,B00009V7OI,"Julie Andrews, the Austrian Scenery, the Children, the Music. The Hills will live on forever in this Superior Classic Musical. Everyone should be treated to watch this movie.
The 40th Anniversary Edition has a special treat, you can set it to play with Robert Wise (director) commentary, and only on this edition can you listen to the entire musical score with the entire spoken track removed (including the songs).. At the start of the movie he will tell you so. If he does not, then you don't have the correct edition. In later editions, he will speak through some of the background score.  I found this to be the best part of all the dvd editions, which is omitted from the blue-ray editions as well. If you listen to any part of it, do listen to the background score when the baroness leaves and  leading up to the gazebo scene (Something Good). It's magical.  In later editions of DVD format and all Blue-ray editions, the Robert Wise commentary has been updated as I mentioned above, the ONLY version that I know of, which offers the entire musical score is the 40th Anniversary Edition.  Of Course, by far, the best picture quality is the newly restored 50th Anniversary Blue-ray in 1080p. This is the second major restoration to the film.",1450137600,4,1246,4.675799086757991

1891304,5,B00009V7OI,"So much comes to mind when I think of THE SOUND OF MUSIC. It is jubilant, heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting to the spirit, this film demonstrates and is a tribute to all the goodness there is in the world and what life has to offer and what we can strive for. I saw this film when I was a little boy and well it was good I suppose but it has grown to mean much more to me with each passing year. There is goodness and love and tragedy in the world as I have now come to realize but when your spirits are low you can return to this film and remember and savor the lessons you have learned and reflect back and see parallels in the images that you once never truly saw. For a film that is greatness I suppose. Someone recently reintroduced me to this film and it has taken on a whole new meaning for me. Happiness is where you find it and make it. The one character that left an indelible image with me was Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte). Captain Von Trappe (Christopher Plummer) implores him to ""Come with us."" Rolfe had his chance to live life as a human being but he chose otherwise and in doing so gave up his chance for happiness. As a viewer, choose happiness and indulge yourself in this film. You will truly take away something of value each time you view it.

Such great talents are associated with this film. The prolific Robert Wise once again demonstrated his vast array of directorial talents (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, EXECUTIVE SUITE, THE HAUNTING, WEST SIDE STORY, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW, RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP) being able to produce yet another gem regardless of the genre. That is a rare thing and Wise certainly seemed like the man for that job on this film given his gentle demeanor and eye for good storytelling. Screenwriter Ernest Lehman is another prolific talent with screenplays for EXECUTIVE SUITE, SABRINA, NORTH BY NORTHWEST and THE KING AND I to his name. Production Designer Boris Leven also was another prolific fellow with production designs such as GIANT, JOHN PAUL JONES and WEST SIDE STORY to his name. The entire cast is excellent. Julie Andrew's nave yet intuitive qualities as Maria matched against the outwardly stern and overtly proud Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trappe, who's personalities must eventually come together in order for them to become life loved partners is brilliantly performed by these two. Particular note should be made to Richard Hayden's performance as Max Detweiler Von Trappe's friend otherwise talent agent who acts as the liaison with the audience with his wry visual expressions.",1424822400,,2552,4.658536585365853

1891310,5,B00009V7OI,"The movie is a classic, one that we watch as a family every year. It's great to be able to talk about Nazi Germany with the children so they understand somewhat what the Haloucost was. Apparently a lot of American teenagers have never heard of Adolf Hitler or mass murder of hundreds of thousands of innocents.

But I digress. The movie is well done, funny in parts, and the singing is lovely. It's fun to see Julie Andrews as a young woman (despite the worst hairdo ever). :)",1318896000,4,476,4.409090909090909

i love watching the special features that this comes with. it's so interesting to see how the real Trap family lived and what happened in their life and to hear them talk about it. and also to see the actors/actresses tell their sides of the story.

So amazing to see that helicopter descend upon Julie twirling it just makes my heart leap everytime I see it. The story we've all heard her tell about the downdraft from the copter endlessly leveling her until they got the shot always comes to mind when I see it.

7993261,5,B00009V7OI,"What more can I or anyone say about about this classic musical that hasn't already been said? Visually it's glorious. It's entertaining, comforting, intriguing, and inspirational with a heartfelt message of independence, endurance and humanity. This movie also depicts a"" PG rated"" glance of the rise of Hitler's nazi Germany and the Von Trapps escaping the third reich. Of course this movie fictualizes aspects of the Von Trapps, their daily lives and careers as singers and how that came to be and their exiting Austria and that's just fine. The true story shines its way past the areas of fiction and you walk away feeling you've gotten a realistic glimpse of their actual lives and circumstances. All the actors do a fine job fleshing out their roles and because of that you can't help being drawn into the story of the Von Trapps. I have absolutely no criticism of this movie. I highly recommend this movie for all ages.",1522368000,,925,4.823899371069182
