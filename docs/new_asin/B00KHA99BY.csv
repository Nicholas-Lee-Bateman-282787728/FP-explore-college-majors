NOT Good. I am a unhappy customer.",1403568000,23,136,4.074074074074074
6428400,3,B00KHA99BY,Very disappointed that there were no subtitles.  The actors mumble most of the time and it is hard to understand them.  Could someone please tell me how Linden was all bruised in the first show of disc 3.  I even went back to the last show in disc 2 thinking I missed something.,1403222400,20,278,4.2075471698113205
6428401,2,B00KHA99BY,"The season is 5 stars! Love this show.

But man, the packaging reminds me of a bootleg. the cover art is poor in quality. You can literally see bad photoshop and pixelation on the cover. The Disc art is bland. No bonus features. No subtitles. The video/audio quality is normal/average id say.

So if you only care about watching the show than this item is fine. I do appreciate amazon doing these MOD things for the less popular shows that don't get their own real dvd releases... but man, just a bit more effort would go a long way! At least make the price match the worth of the product. This is currently $22.46 as I write this review... The price should be $9.99-$12.99 tops!",1402444800,50,679,4.424
6428402,5,B00KHA99BY,"First, let me highly recommend this season of ""The Killing"". The first two seasons had plenty of missteps and issues, but season three is a masterpiece. I got my girlfriend to watch it without having seen the first two seasons; it's completely accessible to those who want to simply skip the first two lackluster seasons. I'd rank this single season even above ""Top of the Lake"" and ""True Detectives"". The writing, directing, and acting is flawless every episode. Mireille, Joel, Amy, Bex, and Peter knock it out of the park.

That said, the packaging for this set is just horrible. It isn't available on bluray, and I would've thought this was a bootleg copy had I not known better. The cover is printed in low quality with pixelation and the DVDs have barcodes on each of them. If Netflix or anyone else ever releases the whole series on bluray, I'll gladly buy it!

Can't wait to see season four on Netflix! Season three had quite the cliffhanger!",1402099200,18,950,4.682634730538922
6428403,5,B00KHA99BY,When The Killing was taken over by Netflix I was very worried that season 3 would not find it's way onto DVD. I am a collector of physical media and do not believe in streaming content if I can get a physical disc. I have been waiting for this release for a few months and I can't wait to see the next chapter of the series. Thank you Amazon for your continued support of the medium. As the previous reviewer mentioned it would be nice if the set included subtitles but overall I have no problem with the set if it's of the same quality as Season 2.,1401667200,14,549,4.092592592592593
6428404,1,B00KHA99BY,I don't understand-season 1 was great and had sdh-season 2 I couldn't watch and now season3 is also a dvd-r and without subtitles--there is so few good stuff worth watching and now more and more is being put out on dvd-r which as now subtitles and quite often sub-standard sound.  They're doing the same with seasons 3 and 4 of The Glades even tho the 1st 2 seasons had sdh--beware,1401062400,19,381,4.442857142857143

6428445,5,B00KHA99BY,"Genius writing by Veena Sud (who also wrote ""Cold Case"" -- one of my & my husband's all time favorite police procedural TV series.)
Bleak cinematography fits the mood of the show. I've been to Seattle on various visits, have relatives there. It's a Great town so don't base your pov about Seattle on The Killing.
Joel Kinnaman (Snabba Cash, Arn: Knight Templar etc.) is fascinating as a complicated new detective. He's a vegan, health food nut former (?) meth addict with snappier patter than Bogey ever had. And that's saying a Lot. His character, Holder, develops beautifully & you So want him to succeed.
Mireille Enos plays a character deep & intense. It's sometimes hard to watch what she goes through with her son & other situations (no spoilers!!) Her background, having spent some time in a psych ward', makes her all the more compelling. It's beautiful to see that lead characters can have ""flaws"" such as broken minds. (I speak from experience, I have bipolar disorder, PTSD & OCD & I worked at a major city's Police Detective Unit. We're out there!)
The story line---very young prostitutes being murdered---is such a tangled web there is no way my husband or I (huge afficiandoes of this genre) could figure out who the ""bad guy"" was.
Peter Saarsgard is incredibly tragic as a man about to be executed. His case is ultra complex, too. He is a brilliant actor. I could watch him sit & breathe. His cellmates are talented actors, too. As are the prison guards. No shortage of gifted actors in this series!
Gregg Henry (so amusing in ""The Riches"") continues with a lot of boistrous bluster but he is no dummy--he's got a lot in common with Columbo (including the raincoat). He is following a trail while acting lackadaisical.
Bex Taylor-Klaus kicks a*** as street urchin Bullet. This  actor had us captivated the moment she hit the screen, interacting with kids like Twitch, Lyric & others (all young actors who are super talented).
Every actor does excellent work in this entire show, from season 1 onward. The writing is at turns funny, quirky, horrifying, tender.
The solution is beyond shocking. It is absolutely mind-blowing.
Cannot give enough accolades to this show.",1459123200,,2181,4.831550802139038

I don't know what there is not to like, other than the cliffhanger ending, which Netflix fixed by making a 4th miniseason. This show is crazy underrated.",1435363200,,303,4.846153846153846

6428487,4,B00KHA99BY,I like the acting of Mireille Enos and the story in general,1433894400,,59,4.0
6428488,4,B00KHA99BY,"There are really two parallel stories going on in the third season.  They are parallel for most of the season and eventually intersect once the whole story plays out.  The first is the case that was alluded to during the Rosie Larson investigation that put a man in jail (and eventually on death row) for killing his wife picks up in the final days before his execution.  The parallel story is about a serial killer who stalks and kills young teenage prostitutes.  I do not want to give too much away, but it ultimately leads to Linden trying to reopen the investigation of the original case because of the similarities with the current investigation.

Like was the case in the first two seasons the acting in the show was very good.  The writing was solid, for the most part, but the show did fall victim to trying to be too cute with the misdirection about the identity of the killer and got downright dumb in a couple spots.  Namely around the inability of the police to immediately find out information on one of the suspects and that person's actions after he became aware he was a suspect.  It made for a dramatic episode yes, but took a lot of suspension of disbelief.

The season ends on somewhat of a cliffhanger, which was initially disappointing after AMC cancelled the series for a second time.  Luckily Netflix did a 6 episode revival to tie up loose ends and included a tie back to seasons 1 and 2.  There was also a final crime to solve which was also done pretty well given the very short amount of time to let things play out.  And thankfully they did not get as intricate with the misdirection in that story as they did in seasons 1-3.  I am including that information here because it is hard to tell if that will ever see the light of day on DVD.

I think part of what made the show good also hurt it in some ways, in that it was almost too much of an ensemble cast put together with mostly character actors.  There was no one true star in the bunch.  In fact Joan Allen who played a role in the final season was probably the biggest star to appear in the series.  That is not to say the actors were bad by any means, far from it.  You bought them as real people, sometimes flawed, with real issues, but I think the presence of more star power may have saved the show from cancellation.

For those who do get these DVDs.  Like the second season release, this is just the episodes on DVD-R.  A total no frills presentation with no extras.  If you have the other seasons on DVD then you may just want this for your collection, otherwise you will be fine just watching the episodes online.  If you liked the prior seasons of the show you will probably like this season too (and the final season should you stream it).",1433289600,,2733,4.347140039447732
6428489,5,B00KHA99BY,This has been one of my very favorite shows of all time.  They keep you enticed and guessing the entire time.,1433289600,,109,4.190476190476191

6428493,4,B00KHA99BY,"I would have loved to rate this 5 stars but, gosh, almighty, I cannot stand any character who goes around being rude and sarcastic all because she had a bad childhood.  Really, I thought we as adults had outgrown the premise that a rotten childhood does not give anyone the right to be undesirable when it comes to working with or for people.  If the lead would have smiled a little bit more she may, I say may, have been more palatable to this viewer.  By  the time I got to the second season, I was sick and tired of the depressed, soulful, images of Sarah thinking who knows what kind of thoughts.  Really, writers, you can do better than this.  What's worse is that someone chose to have her partner falling in love with her.  Oh my god!!!!!!  Please!!!!!  I don't know of any man who would put up with her except out of pity.  Pity is not love.",1431993600,,849,4.25
6428494,5,B00KHA99BY,"This show is not a light easy watch. It's very dark (both visually & pschologically dark)
and it's very moody. These things will affect the way that you watch the show. Everything from the actors clothes, their makeup, the weather on the set, and even the music will have you a little tense.  It is a very well written show. So if you can take dark and moody I would recommend it. An excellent scripts with lots of twists and intrigue with excellent acting

There was no special features at all for the set. Why so stingy?

6428527,3,B00KHA99BY,"The acting is fine,likeable like the Sweden original.
Also I would like to thank the people who picked this up from oblivion.

Now for the Downside. The Third Season shows how expensive elecricity  is in America. The foreboding,brooding Scandivian/Seattle  light is overdone,so much you cannot see most of what is going on!
This began a guessing contest between my wife and I in the last quarter of an hour!
Also why did this version depart in plot so much from the original?
The story line became a little unfortunately comic,especially at the end[we had already guessed the'new' villain at the begining of Disc Three].
But why a big bad cop here?Too predictable
We also cheered when the two leads said that they had had a shower after two discs!
And when Holder ended the disc abruptly with  a tragic 'Oh No!' we could hardly believe our ears or eyes..
Those who know the Scandinavian version will know how much better the plot holds up there.
That said,this is a fine version with a  lot to go for it without eclipsing the original. The moving stories of the promise of youth and potential lost on the streets from abusive and uncaring homes ring very true from great young actors.",1420416000,,1184,4.673076923076923

6428597,5,B00KHA99BY,"I thought that Season 3 was a notch below Seasons 1 & 2 but am still giving it 5 stars. Seasons 1 & 2 seemed to have a numerous twists due to a larger variety of potential suspects (probably because the story encompassed 2 seasons and 26 episodes vice Season 3 which contains 12 episodes).  Season 3 was a more straight forward story (although it did contain some twists) containing two main arcs,(1)  the serial killings of young girls and (2) a death row inmate (played brilliantly by Peter Sarsgaard) awaiting execution for the killing of his wife.  The whole mood of the Season 3 is pretty dark as most of the scenes take place in seedier parts of town or in prison. The acting all around is excellent and the characters feel very authentic.

Just a note on the DVD-R discs which is a Media On Demand product from Amazon. The DVD-R discs played perfectly on my Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-Ray Player. There was absolutely no problems with the video or sound on the 3 discs (12 episodes). The video picture quality was equal to the Season 1 and 2 discs in my opinion.",1409875200,2,1065,4.446153846153846

  I was a little worried about this order because of the number of reviewers who said the audio was bad.  When my copy arrived the audio was terrible.  Amazon made it super easy to return however.  A driver picked up the return the next day and my replacement came the day after. The audio was just fine on my new copy.  Amazon is the most user friendly company I've ever dealt with.  (No, I don't work for them.)

  As for season three, it is great to see Holder and Linden working a brand new case. It has all the great atmosphere, plot twists and cliffhangers I loved in the first two seasons.  I haven't seen the last two episodes but its all ready worth the price.",1408320000,,714,4.246268656716418
6428624,3,B00KHA99BY,"One other reviewer used the word ""bootleg"" to describe this DVD release. I concur, that's exactly how it appears, even though it carries the official 20th-Century Fox logo.

I'm sorry I can't give this release 5 stars, as this is most definitely a 5-star series, one of the best series in many years, but after a proper Blu-ray/DVD release of the first season, the 2nd and 3rd seasons have been treated in a very shoddy way. The 2nd season was available for a while in a DVD-R release, clearly identified as such in the Amazon product summary. This release is not identified as a DVD-R product, but that's exactly what it is! Hence the appropriateness of the ""bootleg"" analogy by the reviewer Nick N. I bought both this and the 2nd season in a store, and both are DVD-R with the most basic packaging and NO EXTRAS, including no subtitles - which is a real liability, since some of the characters do not enunciate clearly.

The sound is fine and the picture quality on the whole is fine. But why this series has been treated to such shoddy DVD releases is simply incomprehensible. Several viewers turned away from the show after the first season, seemingly upset because the story of Rosie's murder was not resolved and continued into a second season. Their loss! But was the studio influenced by these negative reactions and declined to release proper DVD/Blu-ray editions of these two seasons? Very sad, and quite unique in my experience for a studio to resort to cheap DVD-R releases, what you would expect for ""bootleg"" products.",1407974400,2,1532,4.734082397003745
6428645,5,B00KHA99BY,"The darkness continues...it may be my imagination, but Scandinavian series have a dark, dreary and magnificent undertones. The Killing continues with its two undeniably flawed characters that draw the viewers into understanding and identifying with them. Series one was intriguing but was ragged on because the murder of the young girl wasn't solved until season two (unlike REAL murders that are solved in 42 minutes) but it gave its viewers so much more insight into all the characters. Well worth the time and effort. The Bridge, Wallendar are other series with those undertones that both frighten and yet captivate the audience.",1407628800,6,632,5.267326732673268

6428669,5,B00KHA99BY,I like a series like this one because it keeps you guessing until the very end.  The acting is superb and they keep you interested.  It always has some nice twists and Mireille Enos is fantastic.  She's plays a dedicated police detective but is really human in that she has personal problems and sometimes cant balance work with her personal life but the show doesn't drag that out.  The episodes are well written and the directors are excellent.  I really like how this season ended but it leaves you excited about the next season and wondering what will happen to her.,1404950400,4,570,4.603960396039604
6428670,4,B00KHA99BY,"I enjoyed the first two seasons of Veena Sud's THE KILLING mostly because of the breakout performances by Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman as Dectectives Linden and Holder, respectively, and certainly not because of the interminable (and tremendously anti-climactic) mystery of who killed Rosie Larsen. I also liked the supporting performances of Billy Campbell, Michelle Forbes and Kristin Lehman. The various subplots of the first two seasons were far too distracting overall, and ended up being a whole lot of sound and fury signifiying very little. However, when the show was saved from cancellation the first time to give audiences a third season, they went in an entirely different direction, and it was a direction that was far more compelling, and had a lot more to say about the characters and the environment they inhabit than the two previous seasons. Sadly, though, it ends with with a finale that is so infuriatingly rote that it extinguishes almost everything that made season three its strongest season yet.

As the season opens, Linden is now working for the Transit Authority after leaving the police department, but Holder is still there with a new partner (the always terrific Clark Gregg) and they're investigating the murder of a teenaged runaway. Holder brings the case to Linden and she notices an eerie similarity between this case and a case she closed years before. The man she helped convict, a violent offender named Ray Seward (Peter Sarsgaard), is now on death row awaiting execution for the murder of his wife, whose death has uncanny similarities to the runaway's death. Linden returns to the force to assist with this investigation with the help of Holder and the new lieutenant and her former partner/lover James Skinner (Elias Koteas) after Linden discovers 17 bodies of other runaways that have been missing for months and years in some cases. The season also shows the point of view of some of the young runaways and the lives they've had to lead. There's Twitch (Max Fowler), a pretty-boy runaway with dreams of being a model or actor; Lyric (Julia Sarah Stone), a beautiful young girl in love with Twitch and wants to run off with him, and Bullet (Bex Taylor-Klaus), a tough young lesbian in love with Lyric. As the investigation deepens, the show has the usual diet of false leads and red herrings, but the real feast of this show comes from the interactions with the runaways and the employees of the prison where Seward is being held, and the tragic reality of their situations. Seward maintains his guilt in the murder of his wife and insists he dies by hanging. Linden is racing against the clock to find the one piece of evidence that will exonerate Seward and clear her conscience. After the death of one of the runaways, Holder spirals downward, falling back towards addiction. But when the mystery killer is finally revealed in a shocking penultimate episode, the finale is enough to make you rip your hair out as it blatantly lifts almost every moment from a much more famously brilliant and shocking serial killer thriller finale.

Enos and Kinnaman are still incredibly strong, but are overshadowed by the likes of Sarsgaard and the amazing work of Bex Taylor-Klaus as Bullet. Koteas is one of my favorite underrated and underused actors, and his performance is far better than the material he has to work with. The best episodes of this season are actually some of the best television of last year, with the Jonathan Demme-directed ""Reckoning"" which has a devastating scene with Linden and Holder, and ""Six Minutes"" as Seward is about to meet his fate at the gallows.

But the finale, ""The Road to Hamelin"", is such a terrifyingly obvious ripoff of David Fincher's instant classic SE7EN (the killer's speechifying during a long car ride with one of the main characters, their quasi-religious inspiration behind the killings, and the main character's resulting actions) that it just becomes insulting. The first eleven episodes had almost a WIRE-esque quality as it not only showcased the anti-procedural police investigations, but also explored the sociological aspects of a largely-forgotten segment of every major city's population as well as the workaday aspects of what it's like being a guard on death row. It was SO good and SO powerful that the conclusion makes it all the more painful.

Netflix decided to save this show and its REAL final season is becoming available soon, which will partly deal with the fallout of this season's finale, but I just don't know if I'm willing to give it a try because I don't want to go through another season of great television that has such a devastatingly awful ending.",1404864000,4,4666,4.947704081632653
