In the mid-eighties, Paramount had allowed the ASCAP rights to ""Goodnight, sweetheart"" to lapse, causing a video version to  be released with inferior replacement music. ALL of the excised music is back,and the sound is tremendous. I've never heard this episode look or sound better.",986169600,11,476,5.012658227848101
1093528,5,6305910529,CITY is the Best TREK episode Ever. Need I say more? The dramatics of this episode have never been matched. They never will be. They don't make them like this anymore.,971481600,,167,4.419354838709677
1093529,5,6305910529,"Having gotten into Star Trek via the feature films it was a surprise for me to see how much better the series was, and especially these two episodes  here. And that's saying a lot because I definitely loved many of the films.  Here are the most important reasons:
- The story. The reason why a  science fiction film can be outdated in 2 years is not because the special  effects have developed so much in that time, but because the story wasn't  interesting or good enough. While the movies have to cator in part to the  people who have never seen trek, and to the whole ""action  mentality"", these episodes from the 60's manage to bring some  fantastic stories that have you at the edge of your seat for the lenght of  it (and wanting more afterwards :)), not to mention laughing histerically  at the same time. This is the reason why they will never be outdated. A  vivid example of this is to see the klingons as they were in ""Search  for Spock"" and here in ""Errand of Mercy"". In Search they are  more like barbarians and ruthless killers rather than intelligent and  interesting adversaries. Seeing ""Errand of Mercy"" made me look at  Klingons from a whole different point of view. My only explanation for this  would be that the movies are simply more action oriented... and plus, that  style of filming from that time made almost obligatory for better acting  and scripts. Why? Well, can you actually imagine a close up of a Klingon in  a conversation where you were looking to find expressions in the eyes,  etc., to see his/her feelings/intentions in Search for Spock? I certainly  cant! The Klingons are better depicted in ""The Undiscovered  Country"" than on ""Search for Spock"" (especially by the great  acting of Christopher Plummer) but I found this episode to be the most  interesting depiction of them by far, and there was room for much more  even!
- The relationships between the cast members, in the case of this  volume of Kirk and Spock. I see them in a different light now. It is really  amaizing to see them working off each other, the little gestures in the  faces that mean so much, the great friendship, their incredible humor, etc  etc. While in the movies there was drama, humor, and hints of all this,  here you get to see first hand their relationship, not just the characters  but the inmense chemistry of these actors. A single close-up probably tells  more than a whole feature film.
- The Scenery. One of the aspects that  surprised me the most. I could never understand why the movies didn't  utilize better and more varied locations/sets. I think when the story takes  place in different places and not primarily on the spaceships it is always  an enhancement. It takes you more on the ""Journey"" and in  actually feeling that you are there. Here, the stories take place in many  different locations, the most important ones beign a very epic-like ancient  one on ""Errand of Mercy"" and the other on a 1930 setting in the  USA. This was just a delight for me and I finally felt that they had  utilized the full potential and posibility that this incredible concept of  ""Star Trek"" had given.
In regards to both stories, I won't say  anything specific because its much more exciting to watch them without  knowing what to expect. In any case, that info can be found in many places,  including here. However, I will say that they are very well written,  thought provoking, exciting, with tons of humour, drama, and anything  anyone could ask for. ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" is  probably more of a movie than the 6 feature films combined. As I said in  the title, this is Trek at it's best.
One final thing. I used to think  for many years that Star Trek wasn't for me... only to see a Next Generation  episode and liking it a lot... then I thought the older movies/cast weren't  for me still... only to see the films and love them even more... and  finally, I still thought that the original episodes couldn't live up to the  movies only to learn they were inmensily better. So if you are pondering to  get this or not, STOP THINKING ABOUT IT AND DO IT!  Odds are you will  turn into a fanatic like me :)",969408000,2,4138,4.5386702849389415
1093530,4,6305910529,"The late John Colicos of ""Battlestar Galactica"" fame shines as the Klingon commander Kor in ""Errand of Mercy,"" an episode which has an ambiguous title. Whose ""errand"" is it anyway - the  Federation's? As it turns out, the mercy is shown by the Organians who act  to prevent an interstellar war, establishing one of the political  cornerstones of the Star Trek future history. Given the significance of the  so-called ""Organian Peace Treaty"" which is referred to in many  later episodes, I always felt this  episode was too subdued; we don't see  the two starfleets in space and the Klingon occupation forces on Organia  are small in number. Still, Colicos' scenes with Shatner are well acted and  establish the aggressive nature of both captains, a theme which comes up  again and again. DVD lets us see the fog around the Organian castle as well  as the writing on the Klingon occupation notices - they're printed in  English!
SF writer Harlan Ellison is known to have hated the TV  adaptation of his story ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" and we  can see why. Although it is undeniably one of Star Trek's more emotionally  powerful episodes (Bill Shatner's last line still sends chills up and down  my spine), as a science fiction story it does not hold up to repeated  viewings. But this is a strong pairing on DVD; if only there were more  interactive options and liner notes. By the way, somebody goofed on the  package design - there's a photo from a different episode  (""Metamorphoses"") for ""City on the Edge of Forever.""",964483200,9,1529,4.741444866920152
1093531,5,6305910529,"This DVD installment of Star Trek features two episodes which are a must for every fan.  Those with friends unfamiliar with Classic Trek would do well to show them these two episodes.  Their friends will be instantly  hooked.
Errand of Mercy was Star Trek's first story dealing with the  Klingons.  The late John Colicos, best known as Baltar from Battlestar  Galactica, was given a virtually free reign to create the look of his  character.  He saw Kor as a futuristic Ghenghis Khan, and that template  prevailed until the redesigned Klingons appeared in the first Star Trek  movie.  Under Colicos' masterly performance, the Klingons are shown to be  barbaric, militaristic, brutal, but not ENTIRELY evil.  Kor recognizes the  value of valor, and laments that duty requires him to kill Captain Kirk:  ""Always it is the brave ones who die.  The soldiers."" He is also  perceptive enough to recognize that Klingons and Federation members are  more alike than Kirk would care to admit.  This is further demonstrated by  the surprise ending, which hints at the events of Star Trek VI The  Undiscovered Country.  The plot development at the end, involving the true  nature of the Organians is an effective and original twist.
The City  on the Edge of Forever is considered by many to be Star Trek's finest  episode.  The screenplay, based on a story by Harlan Ellison, is craftily  writted and paced.  It is also Star Trek's best time travel story.  Starting as a chase through time for a deranged McCoy, the victim of an  accidental drug overdose, the story takes an abrupt turn toward lighter  fare when Kirk and Spock arrive in 1930 New York City.  After Kirk meets  Edith Keeler (Joan Collins) and recognizes a kindred soul, the story seems  headed for a romantic conclusion.  Kirk at last seems to have found true  and pure love.  Then, what the audience least expects it, Spock lowers the  boom:  Edith Keeler must die, or history will be altered and humanity will  be subjected to another Dark Ages.  The superb writing--most of the  dialogue was by Gene Coon, one of Star Trek's unsung heroes--is backed up  by top flight performances by Shatner, Nimoy, Collins, and the late  DeForest Kelley.  Is it a stretch to say that 50 years from now, Collins  will be remembered for this role, rather than for Dynasty? The lighting for  the 1930 portion of the story looks unusually subdued for a Star Trek  episode, but perhaps the filmmakers were trying for a Depression-era look.
Paramount has done a very good job with sound and picture transfer.  Images are sharper, colors more vibrant, and flesh tomes more realistic  than before.  There are two small mistakes on the box cover:  Despite the  disclaimer, the original music for City on the Edge of Forever (based on  the pop tune ""Good Night, Sweetheart"") has been restored for the  DVD.  The VHS version featured much less effective music.  Also, one photo  on the back cover is from the second season episode,  ""Metamorphosis.""
I envy those who are seeing these episodes for  the first time.",963705600,27,3044,4.841487279843444
1093532,4,6305910529,"In Errand of Mercy, We finally meet the Klingons. One of the longest and most influential trek villians (and then allies), it is wonderful to see their debut. Kirk and Spock have beemed down to Organia, a strategically  important planet in the battle between the Federation and the Klingon  Empire. Kirk orders the Enterprsie too get the fleet, and it is up to the  Captain and First Officer to prevent the Klingons from seizing Organia. The  episdoe becomes an ultimate game of wits and risk. Who's manipulating whom?  A must see!
In ""The City on the Edge of Forever"", Joan Collins  guest stars as Edith Keeler, as 1930's social worker. Dr. McCoy, in a  halucinatory and paranoid state, beams down to an orbiting planet, and  jumps through the Guardian of Forever. He alters the timeline, and suddenly  the Enterprise is gone. Kirk and Spock have to go after him to undo the  pollution to the time line. In 1930's earth, Kirk falls in love with Edith.  And he has to make the ultimate choice: The future of humanity or his love  for Edith Keeler. An ultimately definning moment for Kirk, this episode is  a trek favorite.
Just to see Edith and to see the Klingons alone is  enough reason to buy this DVD. The quality of the sound is particularly  wonderful - and the images are clean and sharp.
What a wonderful addition  to the Trek DVD library!",963446400,,1347,4.5966386554621845
1093533,5,6305910529,"The original Star Trek was far superior to the followups for many reasons  and City on the Edge of Forever, the pinnacle of that series.  Harlan  Ellison's legendary feud over script revision with Gene Roddenberry is well  known, and supposedly the original script is even better than the one used.  Nevertheless I've not seen any other TV script that approaches the  profundity of this.  Kirk and Spock track Bones through a time/space portal  to 1930 and meet Edith Keeler, a person who changed history after being  saved by Bones.  Kirk falls in love with her, but has to decide between  love and the Allied WWII victory.  This whole episode is thought  provoking, the characters are believable, the fact that this was done in  1967 shines through in its creativity and emotional intensity.  Such  a contrast to the ridiculous follow-up series and films.  All episodes of  the original are worth seeing, but this is the best.",960768000,13,928,4.877419354838709

Galway and Chekov beam to the planet's surface. They find that accelerated aging has taken place, killing most of the colonists.  Chekov is terrified when he discovers the first body. The only survivors, an elderly couple who claim to be in their twenties, die shortly after meeting the U.S.S. Enterprise crew. When the landing party returns to the U.S.S. Enterprise, the aging acceleration begins to affect the entire crew... except Chekov, who remains unaffected. While Kirk wants to remain in orbit around Gamma Hydra IV until a cure can be affected, one of his passengers, Commodore Stocker, wants to proceed to Starbase 10 where he feels the best medical aid can be found.
Each person on the U.S.S. Enterprise begins to show the effects of old age and soon Kirk is unable to command, as are Scotty and Spock. Command falls to Commodore Stocker, who, while an efficient desk officer, has no deep space training. Thinking he will save time, Stocker plots a course through the Romulan/Federation neutral zone on his way to Starbase 10. The Romulans are waiting and begin an attack.
Stocker, panicked and inexperienced, has no idea what to do.

We get two of the best episodes from the season here and although the believablility factor is stretched quite a bit on ""City..."", ""Errand of Mercy"" is an excellent episode too.  In the former, we get a Hugo Award winner and in the latter, we get to meet the Klingons for the first time!  Both are great reasons to pick up this volume which represent the best of what Star Trek had to offer from its first season.  In ""Errand ..."", superior beings teach representatives from the Klingon Empire and the Federation an important lesson about coexisting and about settling differences non-violently, something we could all still learn from today too.  Overall, the plot is very good as well as the acting.

""City..."" has become over the years one of the all-time favourite episodes of all Trek fans and I like it too but I have some trouble accepting some of the dramatic licence that this story expects us to take.  For example, when Bones makes his unfortunate leap into the past and changes history, I can't understand why the Enterprise as well as the landing party didn't cease to exist as well.  In any case, if you can ignore this one point, the rest of the episode is a real gem.

1093850,5,6305910529,"""The City on the Edge of Forever"" is great drama presented during Star Trek's phenomenal run in the sixties.  The story was genuine and unique for the time and addressed the issue of time travel quite intelligently..Based on an original story by Harlan Ellison, this wonderful episode starred the beautiful Joan Collins in a sensitive and touching role as Edith Keeler..a social worker who's death has an impact upon history.

The chemistry between William Shatner and Joan Collins works well in this episode and Shatner's acting is very subdued but very effective..He conveys his emotions quite effectively in his closeups!  I can understand why this particular episode is considered one of the best in the series!  Every time I used to run across it as a rerun I would find myself stopping what I was doing to watch it!  Now I have it on DVD and still enjoy watching it!  One of my favorite scenes is the close up on Joan Collin's face when Spock was trying to explain what he was trying to buid with all the the tubes and antennas chirping in their bungalow..Her expression is priceless!  I loved Joan Collins in this role..I wish she would have done more in this vein..

The Guardian of Forever was a unique design and worked very effectively for the show..It must have been quite a feat putting together all of these props for this show..

I would say I am a true Trekkie in that I have read practically every autobiography written by the cast and all the supporting books on the show..I can say honestly that I have seen all 79 episodes at one time or another in my life but now that they are available on DVD I plan on rewatching them and adding my favorites to my collection!

Also DeForest Kelley was superb in this show!  DeForest was a brilliant actor who has made such an indelible impression as ""Bones"" McCoy..In this episode his frenzied state of mind is portrayed convincingly and his scene with Joan Collins is one of the best in the series in my opinion.  This show had it all..great writing..great directing..great acting!!",1109894400,,2041,4.654596100278551

This episode introduced the Klingons, who are portrayed through sharp characterization and skillful acting rather than with the smoke and make-up that would be used on later Trek incarnations.

After history is catastrophically altered by a deranged McCoy, Kirk & Spock must go to THE CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER (1930's New York) to set things right, but find their mission intertwined with the fate of a woman (Joan Collins) with whom Kirk has fallen in love.

1093852,5,6305910529,"Gene L. Coon's Errand of Mercy and Harlan Ellison's City on the Edge of Forever (extensively rewritten by Coon, Gene Roddenberry and story editor D. C. Fontana although it's true to Ellison's original concept)are two of the finest episodes produced for Trek. I would argue the point that City is the best (there were others equally as good if not better and, in fact, Ellison's original script was much, much better than the version that was shot and aired). The former was totally Coon's creation. Coon was the unsung hero of Trek writing many of the original series finest episodes and using his experience as a hands on writer/producer to help Roddenberry fine tune his vision for the series.
Essentially this is a conflict between the Federation (read the United States) and the Klingon Empire (read the Russians or Chinese however you want to look at it). It details a power struggle over a backwater planet where each group wants the planet as part of an ongoing power struggle. Kirk wants Organia to join the Federation as they are strategically valuable. The Klingon Empire invades the planet. They know Kirk and Spock are there and threaten to kill the inhabitants one at a time or in groups unless they give up Kirk and Spock. The Organians refuse as they've got a couple of tricks up their sleeves.
City dealt with time travel. The Enterprise discovers a planet that is almost unstuck (to borrow from Vonnegut)in time. There are portals all over the planet that provided the original inhabitants with gateways to the past. Accidently injected with a powerful but dangerous drug, McCoy loses his mind, attacks crew members and escapes from the ship. Kirk, Spock and a landing party pursue him. They discover the portals, their purpose (they're intelligent and alive in a sense) and McCoy at the same time. McCoy travels into Earth's past to escape the landing party and, somehow, changes the past so World War Two is won by the Axis powers. The result is a stranded landing party and a nonexistant Federation to save them. Kirk and Spock choose to travel to the past to undo whatever damage McCoy has done.
Featuring top notch art direction, effects (for 1967), performances (Shatner is, for the most part, very restrained and very, very effective in both)and direction, both episodes rate highly in the Trek canon and science fiction. City won the Hugo award and Ellison's original (much more emotionally complex)script won the Writer's Guild of America Award (where it was pitted against all episodic television shows submitted for that year).
While City IS a classic and a great episode of Trek, you owe it to yourself to read Ellison's original script which has been published as a trade paperback with introductions by original series writer David Gerrold, story editor/writer D. C. Fontana, Next Gen writer Melissa Snodgrass, actors Nimoy and Walter Koenig. It's a great piece of writing and it's a pity that it has never been produced. Errand, on the other hand, is fairly close to Coon's original conception (although Roddenberry may have had a hand in rewriting it).",1062374400,2,3085,4.911877394636015

1094014,5,6305910529,"I think everyone will agree that Volume 14 is definetly one of the most popular Trek DVD's to date.  The reason being well it's actually quite simple: (1) The debut of the Klingons and of course (2) One of the best Trek episodes ever.  So I can easily say that this is Highly recommended before going into great detail about the episodes.
The first episode here is ERRAND OF MERCY which features the debut of the Klingons led by Commander Korr (played by John Colicos).  This episode finds the Enterprise races to Organia to prevent the Klingons from taking over the planet.  However when they arrive the Organians refuse the help of Starfleet and pretty soon the Klingons invade the planet.  A frustrated Kirk tries to reason with the stubborn Organians who will not allow the Klingons and Starfleet to fight.  Both sides completely unnerved later find out that there is more to the Organians than meets the eye for they are a far superior race compare humans or Klingons.  A classic!
The next episode is one of Trek's finest CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER is easily one of my favourites.  McCoy goes insane after consuming a drug accidently and beams down to a planet with a bizarre Time portal.  When the crew beams down to catch him McCoy jumps into the portal and wisked off to the past altering the course of time to the extent that the Enterpirse no longer exists.  Kirk and Spock go back in time to find McCoy and end up it the early 1930's during the depression.  There Kirk and Spock await for McCoy to show up and they befriend the beautiful social worker Edith Keeler (played by Joan Collins).  Kirk begins to fall in love with the woman and Spock later reveals that in order to set time straight again Edith Keeler must die unfortunetly.  This episode is a powerful drama and easily one of Star Trek's finest episodes ever.  A true classic.
Bottom Line: these episodes must be seen.  Both are excellent and belong in everyones collection!  Highly recommended!",1026950400,5,1969,4.614942528735632
1094015,5,6305910529,"STAR TREK was always at its peak when exploring either the complex sociology between the cultures of different worlds OR the intimate lives and their defining moments of the crew of the USS Enterprise 1701.
In Volume 14, you get one lucky DVD that covers both.
In Episode 27 (ERRAND OF MERCY), you get a layered sociology story of not one, not two, but three different cultures: (1) the Federation, a democracy; (2) the Klingons, a dictatorship; and (3) the Organians, a culture entirely devoted to non-violence.  When these three cultures meet, they clash in ways rarely explored in the realm of science fiction yet alone television drama.  While the episode features a handful of laughable moments (everything in Klingon and Federation property turns 350 degrees, at the Organians control, when the two empires are about to go to war), the writing gives the viewer something to seriously think about when it comes to cultures interfacing.  Whose rules ultimately win out?  What social morales should be dominant?  Why must there be a single victor?  One truly inspired episode.
In Episode 28 (CITY OF THE EDGE OF FOREVER), the viewer is treated to what is, arguably, the finest hour of Trek ever produced: Edith Keeler (played almost whimsically by Joan Collins) must die while Kirk, Spock, and McCoy -- all of whom have traveled back in time to determine what single event changed the course of history -- watch on helplessly.  For a trio that has dedicated themselves to peace at all costs, it's one shocking finale.
The DVD transfer is superb, as usual with these Paramount reissues.  The Dolby 5.1 is excellent, and, despite a few grainy scenes, all looks beautiful in the world of Star Trek.",1022198400,,1698,4.89198606271777

That episode in my opinion is the best episode out of all the 79 of Star Trek the Original Series. I like the time travel concept, specifically the time/space portal that both Kirk and Spock are forced to travel through to bring back the ship's doctor ""Bones"" because he jumps through before they do and when Spock and Kirk jump through into 1930s Earth they have to wait until enough time has elapsed before they catch up with him. He has travelled weeks into their 1930s future. Kirk falls in love with Edith Keeler and Spock tells Jim she must die. Later they find McCoy and he tries to save Edith from getting hit by a truck but Kirk stops him, knowing she has to be sacrificed in order for millions of people to live. By the time they all travel back through the time portal again and return to the moment that they left(scotty tells them they only left a moment ago)Kirk is not the same man. Naturally because of his loss. He says.""Let's get the hell outta here.""Science fiction and television just doesn't get any better than this.",1015286400,4,1224,4.420353982300885
1094017,5,6305910529,"I remember distinctly one day in grade school, towards the end of the school year, when we were all herded into one of the larger classrooms, and were shown ""The City on the Edge of Forever"".  I don't know why they showed it to us, but it was probably to cover a state-mandated day of classes when the teachers had run out of things to teach.
I personally have lapsed into and out of Trek-geekdom.  (Basically, I decided one day in college that if you accept the concept of a warp drive, you have to accept that the rest of physics is bollocks, and what's the point then of dickering over technical consistency).  This episode, however, remains one of my favorite, and, in my opinion, one of the best hours of television ever created.  Possibly this is simply childhood nostalgia, but I think it is something more.
""City on the Edge of Forever"" is a character study that requires a relatively low level of suspension of disbelief with respect to the pseudo-science.  Once you give the writers the benefit of the quasi-mystical Guardian of Forever (not a big leap), you can sit back and enjoy the drama and pathos.  Joan Collins' Edith Keeler, an idealist as far removed from her later roles as night is removed from day, holds our interests as arguably the only woman in the entire canon of the original Star Trek series to engage Kirk's heart, rather than his loins.  The interplay between Spock and Kirk, both humorous and serious, captures our attention as they slowly realize that the future hinges on the sacrifice of someone who is basically innocent and pure of heart, who acts as her conscience dictates and with whom Kirk has fallen in love.  Much has been said about the ending, and the choice of who makes the hard choice at the end.  And in the end, I feel they got it right.  Dramatically, it means far more for Kirk to have been the one to make the hard choice rather than Spock or McCoy.
One of the differences between ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"", the two greatest science-fiction franchises of all time, is simply this:  ""Star Wars"" tends to focus on the people, whereas ""Star Trek"" has an often unpleasant habit of focusing on the technology.  The ""Star Wars"" movies have spaceships, lasers, and all the rest, but how they actually work is mostly irrelevant to the story.  (Which is why the introduction of the ""midi-chlorians"" was such a huge mistake).  ""Star Trek"" has tended to focus as much or more on the science and technology than the people, resulting in a very mixed product quality.  ""City on the Edge of Forever"" is one of those Trek episodes that recognizes that it is people, not technology, that make for engaging drama.  As a result, it is a Trek episode that even strangers to the cult of Trek can appreciate, and a truly immortal hour of television.",1008374400,4,2783,4.5919191919191915
1094018,3,6305910529,"""Errand of Mercy""
Lawrence M. Bernabo's review of Star Trek #27, &#8220;Errand of Mercy,&#8221; which aired on 3-27-1967, threw me at first, because he is an Amazon Top 10 reviewer. So I read it and went with it. But then I got to thinking about the episode and how wrong it was in so many ways. This was rather a weak episode, and I don't care if Harlan Ellison did write it.
In brief, the plot, such as it is, is this: the Federation contacts a strategically important planet, Orgonia, to warn it of a coming Klingon invasion and beg it to ally itself with the Federation, but the Orgonians aren't interested, and Kirk and Spock are stranded there because Kirk has sharply ordered Sulu to take the Enterprise away. The Klingons then come to conquer the planet, and though Kirk is dressed as an Orgonian the Klingon leader recognizes Kirk as different, more like himself. When he finds that it is the famed Captain Kirk of the Starship Enterprise, he can barely control his glee and plans to put Kirk under his mind-scanner to learn Federation secrets. The seemingly powerless Orgonians then free Kirk and Spock, who, uncharacteristically, don't stop to consider how it could be possible, and the two stage a little rebellion that promises to be very bloody. But before the blood really begins to gush, the Orgonians come to tell them that they cannot allow the barbarian war to continue, and that they have made all of their weapons everywhere in the universe inoperable. Kirk and the Klingon both start babbling about their right to make war. But no one anywhere can touch weapons of war because the Orgonians have made them too hot to handle. So they are forced to quit fighting.  Oh--and the Orgonians also tell them that they find contact with the lot of them disgusting because it is so far beneath them and their peace-loving ways. Then, while the lowly humanoids stand with mouths agape, the Orgonians metamorphose into shiny spheres of pure energy and disappear. Fin.
This episode (...) in so many ways. First, it takes Kirk and Spock way too long to realize that the people they are dealing with are not what they appear to be. It's actually clear from the beginning when they approach them about the coming Klingon invasion and they are so superbly certain that they are not in any danger. They are obviously accustomed to interstellar visitors, yet they aren't a bit frazzled by Kirk's horror stories. And it's not till the end of the show that Kirk and Spock get it, which doesn't ring true. The crew of the Enterprise have seen a Q-like entity become a little boy to his far-out parents; they have seen their own crewmen turn into psycho-kinetic super beings, they have seen all sorts of beings who are not what they seem--yet here they take what they see at face value. It doesn't compute. What really seems un-Kirk-like is his easy evaluation of the Orgonians as being cowardly, sheep. He even goes so far as to tell them to their faces that he despises them, which is so out of character. Kirk and Spock are made out to be BIGOTS in this episode, which denies their spirit, from all of the prior episodes, let alone the rest of the series. Their characters are sacrificed in order to dramatize the political enthusiasms of the writer: USA and USSR are equally stupid and evil; the Cold War is dumb; etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum. It (...) that an episode of this visionary series was sacrificed to suit the writer's dumb politics.
Furthermore, what I really find objectionable about this episode is that Kirk, Spock and the Federation are equated with the Klingons, as if democracy, individuality, human rights are nothing, interchangeable even, with the crushing values of military dictatorship. What (...). It's grating to see Kirk and Spock denigrate the Orgonians, when in any other show they would not have. This undercuts the meaning of the whole series. All of the episodes prior to this show the valiant crew of the Enterprise as being earnestly in search of new life to appreciate and contact. What about the Prime Directive? If they had really taken this Orgonia for what it seemed, an arrested archaic civilization, they would never have just beamed down and laid it all out in plain language. This show just doesn't hang together! You see Kirk acting like a war-maniac so he can be equal with the Klingon military governor. It doesn't fit!
This show strikes me as one in which they had a big gun writer on board and the producers didn't have the courage to demand that the integrity of the show be maintained.",1007251200,,4538,4.693851944792974
1094019,5,6305910529,"Volume 14 of the Star Trek DVD Series offers two of the show's most controversial episodes, albeit in different ways, but both having to do with considerations outside of the particular episode.  The Federation and the Klingon Empire have started fighting again and the Enterprise hurries to Organia, a strategically important planet.  Wanting the cooperation of the Organians, Kirk and Spock beams down and find the universe's most passive people, who are not at all concerned that the big bag Klingons are coming.  The Klingons do show up, stranding Kirk and Splock on the planet where they are disguised as Organians and get to witness the arrival of Kor, the Klingon military governor.  Kirk and Spock begin a two-person resistance movement, blowing up Klingon supplies.  The Klingons retaliate against the population, but then Ayelborne, leader of the Organians, decides he has had enough of all this nonsense.  One of the things I most like about ""Errand of Mercy,"" is that it is one of the few times that the Enterprise encounters a race of superior beings who are not seriously flawed in some way.  This also becomes one of the most problematic episodes in Star Trek history, because the Organian Peace Treaty makes it impossible for the Federation and Klingon to go on killing each other.  In theory, anyhow (you have to admit, they have the enforcement capabilities); in practice, the two civilizations would continue to have fun with each other in future Star Trek episodes.
Then we come to what is clearly the most famous, most admired and most controversial Star Trek episode, ""The City on the Edge of Forever.""  As I would think most people know by know, McCoy goes back in time through the time portal of the Guardian of Forever and changes history.  Kirk and Spock follow to set things right, ending up in the U.S. during the Great Depression where they learn that the focal point in time is Edith Keeler, a social worker: Because McCoy will save her life, Edith will lead a peace movement that will delay U.S. involvement in World War II, allowing Hitler time to create the atomic bomb first and win the war (which is not a good thing).  Unfortunately, Kirk falls in love with Edith and does not want her to die.  Originally written by Harlan Ellison, who has published both the original script and his side of what really happened (that's an understatement), the only thing everybody can agree on is that changes were made in the script.  The biggest difference in the two versions has to do with which character prevents Edith from being saved: in the episode it is Kirk, but in the original script it is Spock.  Ellison's point was that Kirk was willing to sacrifice the future for love; the powers that be maintained their hero would not act that way.  Ironically, these two opinions are enshrined in the second and third Star Trek movies, where we go from the good of the many outweighs the good of the one (Spock sacrifices live to save the ship), to the good of the one outweighs the good of the many (Kirk save Spock at the expense of his career).  I have to admit that I very much like both versions; it was years before I stopped crying when I watched the end of ""The City on the Edge of Forever.""  Yet as great as that ending is, with Kirk having nothing to say about what has happened except ""Let's get the hell out of here,"" what Ellison was attempting was even more operatic.  Ultimately, what hurts this episode the most is not the great debate over which version is superior, but that Kirk would have a different girl on a different planet for what seemed like every other episode during the rest of the series, which undermines his (supposedly) epic love for Edith Keeler.",1003017600,2,3706,4.684129429892142
1094020,5,6305910529,"Without a doubt, two of the best of the original series.  Even in the light of the well-written episodes of The Next Generation these stand out as pioneering sci-fi TV.
So far, this is the only one I've bought in this newest format.  While I give the episodes 5 stars, I would give the picture and sound quality 1 star.  It's disgusting how much money Paramount has made off of this show when you consider how absolutely terrible the quality of the DVD's are.  With the technology now available, there shouldn't be any lines, blips or crap in the picture, but now and then, that's exactly what you see.  And there are no special features on the disc and a truly primitive packaging design that any 1st year art student could have done better.  Paramount really dropped the ball on this re-re-re-release.
I realize that greed is cool again, but I for one would spend a little more money (on top of the already ridiculous price) to get something professionally and lovingly remastered and packaged onto the relatively new DVD format.  But, very likely, they will, so I suggest you hardcore Trekkies wait for the ""Golden Jubilee Director's Extra Special Rodenberry Estate Approved Cut Anniversary Edition"" re-re-re-re-release which some marketing schlubb is probably working on somewhere deep in the bowels of Paramount.",997056000,3,1317,4.905405405405405
1094021,4,6305910529,"Well, I'd have to admit that it'd be an understatement to say that this particular volume contains two of the series' most historic eppies. The first show, 'Errand of Mercy', introduced us to the original Klingons, who looked more like members of Genghis Khan's Mongol horde than the ridge-headed warriors of the movie & NextGen/ DS9/ Voyager fame. And of course there's the Organians, whose outward appearance & apparent level of technology belie their true power, which proves to be far greater than the combined might of the Star Fleet and Klingon Forces.
Then there's 'The City on the Edge of Forever', Trek Classic's most celebrated & controversial episode. It featured an early appearance by 'Dynasty' mistress Joan Collins, who played the tragic love interest of James Kirk. How... original!
 Then there's the controversy: writer Harlan Ellison's fight for creative control of this particular Trek has become Hollywood legend, and still garners debates to this day. I've always enjoyed hearing & reading about this battle, especially Ellison's venomous statements about Gene Roddenberry. Even after nearly four decades, he's still got a beef about the whole affair!
But the main reason I watch the show nowadays is to look for flubs, continuity errors, & left-in bloopers. And 'City' has one doozy of a moment. After the cordrazine-maddened McCoy runs into the past, he meets and gives a quick medical once-over to a vagrant, then passes out. The bum takes advantage of McCoy's state, and swipes the doctor's phaser. Here's where the weird part comes into play: in the long shot where the vagrant is fiddling with the weapon's controls before vaporizing himself, you can see that the middle finger of his right hand is missing a knuckle. Then it cuts to a close-up showing his hands working the dials & buttons, and the knuckle miraculously reappears!
At least with James 'Scotty' Doohan, they made a (mostly successful) effort to cover up his slight lack of manual dexterity. But, I guess a different standard applies if you're only a one-episode bit player...

1094023,4,6305910529,"Little more needs to be said about the vibrant and mint-fresh visual quality of these two excellent television episodes. Star Trek has never looked better, and the superb cinematography and music of The Original Series (much better than any of the show's later incarnations) are at last presented in a medium which do them full justice.
The same can't be said for the packaging. Though this may seem a trvial concern, one can't help but feel that the DVD packages (slicks) were put together by young hotshot-trendies who may not have ever seen an episode. The strange choice of typography, not to mention the colours, the incorrect use of photos (surely there are enough Trekkers around to proof this stuff; I estimate it would take the average Trekker 0.2372 seconds to spot the ""Metamorphosis"" photo on the ""City"" slick) and the lack of special features on the DVD makes one feel a little short changed. Compare Star Trek to the ""Contact"" DVD with its multiple audio tracks and commentary. It would have been great to have Shatner or Nimoy or any of the others do some audio, or perhaps a music-only track. Why not some rare stills from each episode (as with the Space:1999 or Thunderbirds DVDs), or some ""making of"" text a'la The Twilight Zone. At the very least, use the classic font for titles and a colour scheme more in keeping with the art direction of the series, rather than the dumb ""hip"" look we have now (out of date by tomorrow afternoon).
The episodes themselves both deserve five stars. This was a great program and one that is sorely missed.",990489600,4,1558,4.710622710622711

Through a series of events he goes through a portal to old earth (depression era). Some how he changes history and the Enterprise disappears.

Read the book on Harlan Ellison's Manuscript first (ISBN: 1565049640). This is not a serialization of the program; it is the original written script. You will be surprised at the transformation from a Harlan Ellison novel to a Star Trek episode (28).

To fit the mold of the series McCoy replaced a drug dealer. The first thing Harlan asked was that if clothes were stolen that they did not look like they were miraculously a perfect fit. And Spock stops Kirk from saving Edith. Kirk would have given up the future for love.
