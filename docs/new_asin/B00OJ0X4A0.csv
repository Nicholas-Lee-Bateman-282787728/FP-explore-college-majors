6752875,4,B00OJ0X4A0,"We just finished watching the 3rd season of this series, and it is again a terrific show.  The only reason I downgraded the 3rd season is because the discs only had closed-captioning capabilities and not subtitles.  Let me state that closed captioning can only be used if your DVD player is connected to your tv with component cables, and not via an HDMI cable.  Because we have our DVD player connected via an HDMI, we have to have subtitles on any DVD disc.

I suspect that many people now have their DVD players connected via HDMI, which makes closed captioning capabilities eliminated.  We must have subtitles.

Because I had ordered seasons 1 & 2 previously and they came with subtitles, I assumed that season 3 would also have subtitles.  My mistake.",1429401600,5,756,4.7251908396946565
6752876,4,B00OJ0X4A0,"If you like Episodes 1 and 2 you will like this one as well. Fun Showtime serial show.  See the other Joey, not the friends Joey.  Hilarious.  Fie mature audiences.",1428451200,,164,4.4
6752877,5,B00OJ0X4A0,"I had never seen Matt LeBlanc before simply because I never watched ""Friends."" So I can solely judge him on this show and he is hilarious. He plays himself, much like Larry Davis does on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" But the two actors are quite different comedic personas. LeBlanc is everything you would expect a good looking successful acting success to be. He is the essence of self centeredness. However, you can't help but like the guy. Into his life come two British tv writers, a husband and wife team. They are used to the accent on quality UK tv. This is their first time in Hollywood. They have never met anyone quite like LeBlanc, or even worse, their producer, played by John Pankhow as the smarmiest producer Hollywood has ever created. The woman playing the producer's assistant has gotten a bigger role in each and every season and she is quite good too. All in all, these people in Hollywood as seen through the eyes of two London tv writers who never had to work on anything but quality tv, is as funny as it gets.

Everyone on this show is very, very funny. I only wish it had more episodes in each season. These non-network  shows have much shorter seasons than the 22-24 episodes you'd get per year of a hit comedy like ""Frasier"". 8-10 episodes per season is the best you get on ""Episodes.""",1428451200,2,1305,4.52542372881356

8683878,5,B00OJ0X4A0,"This show is funny.  Matt LeBlanc, Tamsin Greig, Stephen Mangan, and Kathleen Rose Perkins were awesome together.  This show is for mature audience, funny for the adult, but not teen or younger children.  I can't wait for season 4th.",1496880000,,233,4.923076923076923
