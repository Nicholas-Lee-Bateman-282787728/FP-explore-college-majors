2639528,5,B000HOJR6C,My son enjoys this movie and he tends not to be scared of the bad guys.  Since buying this movie I have only watched it 50 times and still I can sit through it.,1210723200,,160,3.7058823529411766
2639529,5,B000HOJR6C,"For people of all ages, this cartoon is a wonderful show. I remember watching as a child and even now as an adult I still enjoy watching it. It is one of the great movies that I will be passing down to my children.",1186963200,6,214,3.8863636363636362
2639530,5,B000HOJR6C,"I read the other reviews below and have to disagree. I quite enjoyed this episode. It isn't really a movie but a hour long episode of the show. the care bears mainly featured are: Tenderheart, Funshine bear, Grumpy bear, and for you hugs and tugs fan out there Hugs and Tugs. Basicly the story is about (who else) the nutcracker who just happens upon the carebears while they are on a caring mission. That caring mission then turns into a huge adventure when the carebears and the nutcracker try to save toyland from a evil vizier. the side story involves hugs and tugs and a young boy trying to find the perfect christmas deceration for the carebears christmas tree. I thought this episode was really well written and is well worth the money. esp. for those of you who like hugs and tugs and can't find many episodes of the show with them featured in them. by the way, for those of you worried about your kids being scared by the vizier, don't worry, he isn't that scary. basicly this episode of the carebears is just what it says on the box, ""A Heartwarming Treat for the Whole Family"" (or at least for your kids if you don't like carebears). the only thing is is that while it is the christmas episode, christmas dosen't figure into it quite as much as you might think. The elements are there but it isn't as important as it is in other show around the holidays. I personally Recommend This Episode of the carebears to carebears fans of all ages.",1177545600,15,1449,4.451127819548872
2639531,5,B000HOJR6C,While not the best care bears show it was funny. I also liked how they were trying hard to appeal to boys as well.,1168819200,,114,3.7916666666666665

2639533,5,B000HOJR6C,if you have little kids it is so cool to wacth this with them and i  would wacth it all the time i mean i am 17 years old and when i wacth this movie i feel like a little kid again so buy this and you and your kids will love it trust me,1168128000,,236,3.290909090909091

2639556,1,B000HOJR6C,"The description on this movie needs to be updated - in a big way!

""Get ready to enjoy your favorite holiday treat, only sweeter. Join the Care Bears as they bring to life the classic tale of the nutcracker, as only these bears can."" - That's not what this is at all.

I don't know what I expected from that - something along the lines of the Carebears act out the Nutcracker. I should have read the reviews first. The evil guy scared my child to the point we turned it off. She has watched the ballet several times. The scariest thing in the ballet is a mouse king who is knocked out by a ballet shoe to the head. I would definitely not recommend this for kids under 7 or 8.",1417392000,,675,4.106060606060606

2639593,2,B000HOJR6C,"My wife grew up with both the Care Bears and the Gummi Bears. She could watch these things around the clock for hours on end. With that said, I did not. I came from an early period, when Christmas presentations were still the old films ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"", as well as the TV greats ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Frosty the Snowman"", by Rankin/Bass. If she were to review this, it would be through the ceiling with love and memories, so I thought I would, instead, review it, since I'd purchased it for her and the fact that I am not biased in the least (meaning I am not a fan, yet I do not have any reason to despise the bears). The movie seems a bit plodding and has really nothing whatsoever to do with The Nutcracker. However, if you love the Care Bears, you may enjoy this one, too.",1358208000,,828,4.280254777070064

2639619,2,B000HOJR6C,"Amazon did a great job with shipping and packaging, so this review is in no way meant to be critical of them, just the product.  The characters are adorable, and the story of the Nutcracker is told in a unique way (though there are some scary parts, even for my 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 year olds, which probably could have been portrayed in a bit different way).  Sadly, the quality of the visual experience is absolutely terrible.  Grainy, sometimes disjointed; pretty bad animation to begin with, but even that may be forgiven were it clear and sharp.  Neither is true, unfortunately.  Would not recommend.",1294185600,,600,4.6761904761904765
2639620,5,B000HOJR6C,"The Care Bears,the Nutcracker,not a combination I  expected much from. I was delightfully wrong. It does have a few intense scenes (ask Braveheart,knock on wood)but nothing too scary. In fact the bad guys(you dirty rats) are a bit humerous. Let's not
forget about the good guys. Besides the Care Bears, the Nutcracker and Sugar Plum Fairy work together to triumph in the end.
Toyland must be saved!
  This would be a nice movie to watch on a cold stormy night with the ones you love.",1293148800,,483,4.658823529411765
2639621,5,B000HOJR6C,"Great movie! Reminded me of my childhood, and my 3 year old daughter loved it too. The little carebear that comes with it is a nice size for her, she calls it her baby care bear.",1290297600,,178,3.9722222222222223
2639622,5,B000HOJR6C,"I used to love the Care Bears when I was little, and got this for my daughter. She really enjoyed it and now my 4 yr old cousin insists on watching it every day, if not more. This is a cute, fun Care Bear version of the Nutcracker that both little boys and girls will love, and parents can tolerate. Anyone who says ANY Care Bear movie/video is too scary must have extremely wimpy kids. It's CARE BEARS for Goodness sake. If we all never let kids know there's bad people in the world they'll be more harmed than if they know early on.",1284508800,,534,4.144230769230769
2639623,5,B000HOJR6C,"I have never been a fan of the care bears growing up but I grew up watching this one I love it. The story is about a prince who has turned into a nutcracker by an evil vizier and he gathers up a little girl named anna, her little brother peter and the care bears to save a place called toyland from a bunch of evil rats and the evil vizier. Great movie and recommended for everyone.",1282780800,,382,3.9740259740259742

2639625,1,B000HOJR6C,"My 3 year old has a REALLY BIG THING for Carebears! She loves them and wants to watch them all the time. The only problem is that she was introduced to the ""newer"" version of the Carebears. She loves, ""Oopsy Does It!,"" and, ""Big Wish Movie.""

She got this movie for Christmas and while it did hold her attention for maybe 10 minutes, she got tired of it. It just doesn't have the same colorful effects, and it doesn't hold their attention. It seems very bland compared to the newer ones. So my daughter would give this one thumbs down!

As an adult, I really like the newer ones better too. They are much more creative and the stories are great. The Nutcracker had me wanting to go to sleep.

On the other hand if your looking for the older versions of Carebears, then this might just be what your looking for.",1235088000,,810,4.315789473684211
2639626,5,B000HOJR6C,"This is not the classical tale of the nutcracker.  If you are looking for the ""real"" version, you won't find it.  The teacher in the film even says that there are MANY retellings of the original version and this is simply her favorite.  This is the Care Bear's adventure with the nutcracker/prince in Toyland.  It's a great movie for families, or even for those adults that have grown up watching these movies.  It's nice to revisit them.",1230249600,,438,4.636363636363637

From a cinematic standpoint? Not a masterpiece. But for good, clean family fun and nostalgia, I give it the highest ratings. The look on her face when she opened it was well worth the price.",1521763200,,354,4.298507462686567
