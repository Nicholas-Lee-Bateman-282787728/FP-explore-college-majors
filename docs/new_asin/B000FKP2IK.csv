8125257,2,B000FKP2IK,I liked to listen to Dangerfield and his one liners.  Ordered this DVD and was VERY disappointed that there is little of Dangerfield on it.  This disc is mostly other people talking about Dangerfield.  What a disappointment.  I would not recommend this to someone who wants to listen to Dangerfields routines.,1306713600,,309,5.0
8125258,5,B000FKP2IK,"I actually remember watching this variety show the first time around, it was hilarious then and even better now.  If I remember correctly, Rodney was just hot off of Caddyshack and got good friend Bill Murray to join in on the action.  Rodney, as always was gold, and never missed a funny beat.  I had to watch the bit with Rodney as the Mikado's Lord High Executioner 5 times because I was laughing too hard.",1164931200,3,409,4.426666666666667
