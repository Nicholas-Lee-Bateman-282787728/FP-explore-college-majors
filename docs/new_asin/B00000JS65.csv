1238487,5,B00000JS65,"If you've found yourself caught up in the whole McCourt heritage like I have,  you will definately want to add this to your collection.  The film is touching and entertaining, and is a hidden gem for people that have read Angela's Ashes and A Monk Swimming. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.",1095638400,11,300,4.537037037037037

1238489,5,B00000JS65,"I just saw the dvd today and I enjoyed it very much. It's a great addition on Frank and Malachy's books. Do not expect it to be some sort of movie, because it simply is not. The four brothers tell you all about their 'adventures' in New York, about Frank being a teacher, Malachy working in several bars, being an actor, his career as a gold smuggler etc.
I really enjoyed the part where Frank and Malachy did a part about their past on stage. They showed some tape. I wish they could bring that out on dvd. I bet that it will be great for a good laugh. Malachy is real funny.
I also enjoyed Mike's story. Though he was pretty serious (of course), I think you can have a great laugh with him too. And Alphie, he did tell his story, but I wish he told more.
Maybe it's because he is not mentioned very much in the books. Well maybe he will tell his own story in a book someday?
Last, hopefully they will put the McCourts in Limerick on DVD, so that I can watch it too.",1009584000,22,967,4.0680628272251305
1238490,2,B00000JS65,"Very disappointing. Disjointed effort on behalf of a McCourt nephew. Seems  more like a school project rather than the touching journal that resulted  in Angela's Ashes. Some frames are out of focus(not an effect). Too much  focus on Malachy, not even-handed. Turned a well-intentioned story into a  drudgery. Not even enough photos that would have made the difference.",965865600,6,369,5.310344827586207
1238491,5,B00000JS65,"The McCourts of New York is a great companion piece to Frank McCourt's memiors, Angela's Ashes and 'Tis, and to Conor McCourt's earlier film, The McCourts of Limerick. Its glimpses of the lives of the four McCourt  brothers are funny and touching. The film gives not only a look at the  rollicking past of the brothers McCourt but a personal look at what their  family tragedies mean to them now. If you loved reading Angela's Ashes as  much as I did, you'll want to see this wonderfully human documentary.",950227200,40,506,4.651685393258427
1238512,5,B00000JS65,This is a really excellent video. It proved to be very helpful with my research project on the McCourt family.,1335657600,,110,4.55
1238513,4,B00000JS65,Nice video. It was good to see one of my favorite authors on film and with his Irish family. But you have to read the three books first to get a sense of the author Frank McCourt and his life.,1288051200,2,192,3.825
1238514,5,B00000JS65,"I am a huge fan of Frank McCourt's books (Angela's Ashes, 'Tis, and Teacher Man) and this film actually goes into greater detail regarding the family dynamic. Not only between the brothers and their mother, but also the personal struggles each one encountered and how they overcame. I absolutely loved this DVD!",1270598400,,311,5.0
1238515,3,B00000JS65,This video gives you more info about the McCourts...but you have to be a true fan to enjoy it.,1259452800,,94,4.0
1238516,5,B00000JS65,This is a continuation of the McCourts after coming to America.  Why hasn't anyone made a movie (or movies) about this family after they left Ireland?  This is a wonderful saga of the McCourt family.,1253232000,,199,4.6571428571428575
1238517,5,B00000JS65,"While reading Frank McCourts' 3 memoirs of his growing up years and teaching years, I found this DVD on Amazon.com which was produced by his nephew about the four McCourt ""boys"" in New York.  I became addicted to his fascinating story.
There is another one of their life in Limerick which I ordered in VHS.

They are each interviewed and tell their stories of arriving in America and getting acclaimated....Frank through hard work and schooling and poverty...Malachy through charm and luck and personality and the younger brothers, Mike and Alfie, because their older brothers had paved the way for them.

All four had alcohol issues ironically similar to their father and struggled with that problem for years.  How they survived at all is the mystery.

There are insights into their mother's personality which show how she was more bitter and unhappy and unloving than I had earlier realized.  They make no apologies or whitewash the truth.  It was interesting to see and hear in their own words the brothers that Frank McCourt described in his three books.

The bittersweet humor, memories and closeness of the brothers made this an enjoyable story.",1251417600,3,1152,4.994764397905759
1238518,5,B00000JS65,"This documentary was interesting to me because I saw it right after reading both of Frank McCourt's books: Angela's Ashes and Tis. So, I was interested to see what the documentary offered. Since then, I read Malachy's book.

What this documentary offers is a brief summary of what happened to Frank and his three brothers after they had all arrived in the United States as young adults from Ireland. Frank's story I knew, but nonetheless he's always interesting to hear, not just read about. His brothers, which look similar to me with their pudginess and white hair, all have some interesting tales to tell. The Irish make good storytellers, that's for sure.

Near the end of this 70-minute program is a very dramatic scene when the brothers get together to find the grave site of their sister who had died shortly after birth. Frank shows he's the most sensitive one in the family.

All in all, if you are fan of the brothers' work, this a nice documentary of a very interesting family. I would watch it more than once, just on its own merit.",1237420800,2,1044,4.632432432432433
1238519,5,B00000JS65,"I certainly enjoyed the Mc Courts of New York, The price is right and was in excellant condition(possibly new).",1208217600,2,111,4.894736842105263
1238520,5,B00000JS65,"After visiting Limerick, Ireland and taking a literary walk about the book by Frank McCourt, Angela's Ashes, in January, I wanted to learn more about this amazing family.  This picks up with their life here in the US. This documentary with the family themselves telling the story is very real and emotional.  I did watch the movie version of Angela's Ashes and then watched this documentary and it really answered questions that the movie left unanswered for me.  One of the reasons I have gotten so interested in these people is because the literary tour I took in Limerick was conducted by a childhood friend of Frank McCourt and lived through the story as well.  I would recomend this documentary and Angel's Ashes to anyone that is interested in how a family can overcome the most difficult of times just by being strong and sticking to what they believe in.",1204416000,3,862,4.726666666666667
1238521,5,B00000JS65,"If you love the movie ""Angela's Ashes"" as much as I do, please buy this companion piece. Anyone with immigrant ancestors or who comes from a family where a father was absent due to drinking and a mother had to struggle to keep going for her children can appreciate the poignancy and introspection offered. There is a hauntingly beautiful song at the end of the documentary that speaks volumes about what life was like for Angela and it is a song that unfortunately still rings true today for thousands of mothers around the world and here at home. I am not even Irish (I'm Italian) but it is something to be appreciated by all.",1173744000,12,627,4.508771929824562
