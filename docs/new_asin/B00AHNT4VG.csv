8551700,3,B00AHNT4VG,"You need getting used to John Ford's humor, but his unintentional humor, though very rare, is priceless. You can't approach Seven Women in the same way you approach his masterpieces. The only way to save this film is to lean back and enjoy the performances of Mike Mazurki, Woody Strode or Betty Field. After a while you know this must be the picture John Wayne took as a model for his own Green Berets. Well, the picture quality of the Spanish DVD isn't much to brag about, but it is anamorphic widescreen and better than the average Spanish DVD. And there is an interesting short making off following the trailer. I bought it at Spanish amazon for 6 Euro. Now it costs a fortune.",1382227200,3,681,4.5
8551701,3,B00AHNT4VG,"John Ford directed this Mongolian western with an almost exclusively all-woman cast. A group of women gathered at a godforsaken mission have to fend for themselves against barbarian marauders and lecherous rapists. The women have their faults but the few male characters seem to be played by Godzilla AND Megalon, or perhaps Joan Crawford's discovery, TROG! Against these wooden and unappealing leading men the women get to emote while their world turns in on them. Anne Bancroft (taking over from an unwell Patricia Neal) comes off best as a tough doctor who gives herself to the men to save a baby. Margaret Leighton as den mother at the mission overacts outrageously, but someone has to to save this film from long drawn out boredom. Flora Robson has little to do but wonder why she's in a film with ""Lolita""'s Sue Lyon, and Betty Field, Mildred Dunnock and Anna Lee make up the numbers and are largely indistinguishable from each other. One of Ford's lesser efforts.",1380412800,2,970,4.884848484848485
8551702,4,B00AHNT4VG,"Hard not to like a John Ford film.  I did not know what to expect from this film and was pleasantly surprised.  Well done.  The question has been asked as to why Ford's later films usually are not as well received by the public.  Even ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", considered by many to be a classic film, did not do well at the box office as most of his earlier films. I would like to read the definitive answer to that question. I think this is a good film, not on the level with ""The Searchers"" but well crafted and focused on the 7 women.  The two men, Woody Strode and Mike Mazurki were important although peripheral to the story and their dialogue shows it. I think it is worth the price and the soundtrack is in English.  Perhaps with a little humor to balance out the film more people would have paid to see it.",1374883200,2,825,4.189873417721519
