8449660,2,B004ZEDJAK,"Federer is a great tennis Player if not the best ever. This video is not good enough, and annoying due to the cut and paste Editing of the original Ad plus TV video. You will not enjoy the game while you will notice the sudden stop, followed by the after Ad events.",1383091200,,265,4.115384615384615
8449661,4,B004ZEDJAK,"Federer is an overhyped tennis player from SUI. Roddick is an American hero and one of the best tennis players ever. This was a nice match that Roddick let Fed win. The editing on this tape is BR-utal & stinks more arse than 4 day old stir-fry in my parents' fridge. In short, if you're feeling sentimental about Roddick (and that's totally fine) then go ahead and buy this.
If not get a DVD featuring the best of all time - Novak Djokovic. That's right, the Serbian Prince - The Djoker. Call him maybe!
Djoko for life. Enjoy retirement Andy. You are awesome too, just not as good as Djoker.",1346544000,,591,4.381818181818182
8449662,3,B004ZEDJAK,"It goes without saying that this was an enjoyable match to watch.  However, be aware of the following: (1) This is simply a copy of the CBS coverage - no better than if you videotaped it.  NFL scores actually scroll at the bottom of the screen.  2) Abrupt cutting from the end of one game to the start of another.  Half the time you don't even see the players get back to their chairs (which is why this is only 120 minutes long), and (3) Non-stop talking by announcers Dick/Mary/John through all the points.  Personally, I just find this annoying as I prefer the BBC coverage - but that's just my preference.",1318809600,2,609,4.401785714285714
