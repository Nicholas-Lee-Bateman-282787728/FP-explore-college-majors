8357279,5,B001GT9DTS,"When They Cry Vol. 4 & 6 are by far some of the hardest standalone series DVDs I've ever seen (or haven't seen, 'cause I've yet to see someone selling them). But I hope someday I can find at least one of them for sale.",1322006400,2,218,3.8666666666666667
8357280,4,B001GT9DTS,"This is one of the greatest shows in the world!!! But i personally think the english version is for people who can't read subtitles!!! The voices do not fit the characters and the actors cant...act! And I hate the way they say Keiichi's name. Kay-AY-chi. It is pronounce KAY-chee with a lot of emphises (sp?) put on the ""eii"" part.
But anyway, a great anime no matter who voices it. It may seem confusing but the next series (which will hopefully be dubbed soon) will set things straight for you!",1232064000,2,496,4.522222222222222
8357281,5,B001GT9DTS,"This show is indeed not for the weak of stomach. Also, if you can't stand the thought of children killing children it is also not for you. Otherwise, this anime is wonderful. Very suspensful. It keeps you scratching your head until the very end but is very satisying in its ending. At first I got annoyed with the seeming ""Groundhog"" theme but it sorts itself out in the end. The animation is very simple but i think that was done purposely to make things seem cute and simple despite the horror and mystery really present.
The only thing I can really complain about is Rena's voice annoyed the living daylights out of me! But she grows on you after awhile",1231372800,3,656,4.475
