2702307,3,B000LC4CVA,"The girls that sing in this dvd are not really good, I was somewhat bored while watching some of the songs but mairead nesbitt is a very talented artist and her performance kept me glued to the tv, lisa kelly is also very good, the participation of these two artists is the only reason i bought the dvd and cd.",1165881600,3,310,4.183333333333334
2702308,5,B000LC4CVA,This program has been running on all three PBS station in the San Francisco Bay area for the last week. This is the only program that I have ever watched over a couple of times.  I have seen every presentation.  The count must be about twelve.  Every one of these young women has a beautiful voice and all are very beautiful women.  I can't wait until this dvd is commercially available. Most of my music collection is Celtic music. I have over 90 celtic cd's. This will certainly will be one of my favorites.,1165881600,9,509,4.382978723404255
2702309,5,B000LC4CVA,"The music, the setting, the MAGIC!  I was lucky enough to be at Slane Castle for the filming of this DVD.  It was truly a magical experience. As usual, all the girls were phenomenal!  The castle in the cool damp air, the lighting, the fire & smoke, the beautiful gowns, the angel voices - it was a fairy tale come true!  The DVD captures that magic and takes me back to Ireland. Thank you Lisa, Orla, Chloe, Mairead, Meav & Hayley for bringing such beauty to this world! David Downes is truly the musical genius of our time!",1165795200,40,524,4.316326530612245
2702310,5,B000LC4CVA,"I just saw this show on PBS and it's wonderful.  Such beautiful music and performances.  Highly recommended.  I would say tho that the run time listed for the performance must be a mistake as the PBS airing, which excludes some tracks found on the dvd, is exactly the same run time as the dvd, so the dvd must be closer to 90 minutes.  Just a point of information.",1165708800,11,364,4.3088235294117645
2702311,5,B000LC4CVA,"Celtic Woman. Need I say more? I just caught the new concert, and WOW. What more can I say. I loved their first CD and their new music is just as good, if not better. What wonderfully talented young women. Their voices are amazing, single or together, their voices shine. Mairead can play the violin with such grace and ease. If you are a fan of Celtic Woman but have not heard their new music, pre-order the CD and DVD now. It is worth the wait to get.",1165622400,20,453,4.159090909090909
2702312,5,B000LC4CVA,"I am a lifelong musician and especially love Celtic music. It has such a magic to it, and I love the stories they tell. These lovely ladies were phenomenal singers. Beautiful spirits with totally classy presentation. I believe just about everyone knows a lot of these old classics no matter how young or old you are. The energy level was phenomenal! Although I'm a happily married man, I did fall in love with the gorgeous violinist! What a performer. As she played (incredibly well) she danced and flirted with the audience and I might add some of the guys watching really got into it!  All in all, an incredible experience. I'm buying the DVD as soon as I can. Do yourself a big favor and buy it! p.s. the band was the highest excellent standard of musicianship and very lively too!",1165449600,21,784,4.560283687943262
2702313,4,B000LC4CVA,"I haven't seen the original Celtic Woman concert.  I watched this one on PBS, mainly because I wanted to see Hayley Westenra, one of my favourite singers.  To my surprise, Meav is one of the regular members of the group (I have two of her older albums).  So I was familiar with two of the singers already, even though I didn't realize it!  All the voices blended very nicely, and the harmonies were incredible.

I would give this concert 5 stars, except that one song, ""Sing Out"", was very off-putting.  It was almost like Christian rock, and I really don't like that kind of music.  The concert recovered after that, though.

I would definitely like to see this show again, but on DVD so I can skip through the song that I didn't like.",1165449600,46,736,4.440298507462686
2702314,5,B000LC4CVA,"When I DVR'd this show on PBS, I expected the usual PBS musical fare, heavy on education, short on entertainment.  Whoa!  Big surprise!  These 5 women are nothing short of captivating, and the supporting cast, especially the two percussionists, obviously got carried away by the magic of the concert.  I don't speak a word of Gaelic, and the songs these ladies sang in Gaelic simply knocked my socks off, especially Maev's version of Dulaman (hope I spelled it right).  The concert was held at night in front of an ancient Irish castle, and for the lucky concertgoers, there was truly old Celtic magic in the air that night.  See this if you can, it's an awesome experience.",1165449600,,674,4.717948717948718
2702315,5,B000LC4CVA,"My DH told me to be at the T.V. at 8PM sharp last night because he had a surprise, and WOW I forgot all about the PBS special last night. The Celtic Woman were on and it was they're New Journey concert.  I think that it was better than the first concert if that is even possible.  All six girls were at they're finest and I really enjoyed it and the songs were great. All the girls were more relaxed around each other and Chloe's voice has greatly improved as ever, Lisa,Orla and Meav were fantastic as well. Haley the new girl fit in as well. Finally Maire'ad what can I say about her but great.  Now I'm not sure if I should buy the DVD first or risk trying to find the CD at the store or pre-order that as well. AH WELL, decisions",1165363200,60,733,4.041379310344827

CD player refused to play it. I hadn't noticed that forcing it off the spool had apparently cracked the disc and it refused to play.
I order another just like it the next day..I hope I won't have to destroy this one by forcing it off the center spool...if it sticks, I am sending it back

2702408,5,B000LC4CVA,"By far my favorite musicians and music is Celtic Woman!  All of their music and performances just hit all the right chords for me.  This is music unlike any I've ever heard, experienced, or seen.  These women give real performances - so full of passion, heart, beauty, and soul. They are SO talented, gifted, professional, and blessed!  My goodness - wow! :)
Everyone of the songs are masterpieces and are powerfully and perfectly done. Some reviewers complain about the choices of songs and even (shocking to me) about the concert, saying some songs were corny or too familiar or that their original concert was better.  Really, lol? Then I'll buy that one too.  :)  Don't let these reviewers discourage you from owning a rare gem.
The only song I was familiar with was 'Over the Rainbow' (Judy Garland's famous Oz song) and it was STILL AMAZING and beautifully done by four of the singers, but other than that, EVERY SONG was fresh and new to me. I love Celtic music in general even when it's only instrumental: what makes Celtic Woman so special and unique is that not only does it have the beautiful and lively instrumentation by Mairead with her violin (along with some amazing drummers) it also takes many songs that are familiar to lots of Irish and Scottish peoples (though unfamiliar to most Americans like me) and redoes them in such a fresh, amazing, and beautiful way.
This is an amazing assortment of music and song: there's EVERYTHING on this DVD concert!  If you want some lively, playful, romantic songs, there's 'At the Ceili,' 'Spanish Lady,' 'Dulaman,' and more.  If you want some powerful, moving, and inspiring songs there's 'Caledonia,' 'Shenadoah,' 'You raise me up,' 'The Prayer,' 'The Blessing,' 'The Voice'... And if you are looking for songs that are just deeply sad and yet so beautiful and sweet, there's 'Lascia Ch'io Pianga,' 'Danny Boy,' and more.
EVERY SONG on here is overwhelmingly beautiful and beautifully done by some amazing performers.  Hayley's piercing sad eyes and soaring voice will melt you when you hear her sing the profoundly beautiful and sad 'Lascia Ch'io Pianga,' and Meav mesmerizes as she eloquently and playfully sings 'Dulaman.'  (Meav - is well-spoken in Celtic and Gaelic languages and she articulates and sings that song in original Gaelic SO beautifully that it makes you want to learn the language yourself.)  :)
Mairead is a rare, fiery, beautiful Celtic flame. She is JUST AMAZING with her performance, dancing, and violin. (It's hard enough to learn the violin, and to play all kinds of pieces as fiercely and powerfully as she, but on top of that: she's DANCING WHILE SHE DOES IT!  Lol - again: wow!  :)
Orla shines throughout and while singing and playing her harp in the beautiful 'Carrickfergus,' and Chloe is amazing in 'The Prayer' and 'Panis Angelicus,' and more.
It's hard to pick a favorite performer/singer as I dearly love them all and they all look and sound like angels, but I have to say that Lisa is just a wonder to behold!  All my favorite songs (both in the concert and in the albums I own) are done by Lisa and she is just gravitating with her heartfelt performance and overwhelmingly gorgeous voice. (I could listen to her sing 'Caledonia' everyday!  She's just so beautiful and amazing.)
There is absolutely NO BAD singers, songs, or performances on this amazing 'New Journey' DVD.  EVERYONE is an amazing, beautiful, and flawless singer and the vocals/music/songs are SO GOOD it's hard to put into words.
Celtic Woman 'A New Journey' (as well as their 'Songs of the Heart' concert) is invigorating and relaxing, spiritual and lively, tender and bold, flirtatious and elegant, exciting and serene, deep and simple.  It's historical yet personal; cultural yet universal.  It's profoundly sad, and yet, profoundly beautiful, uplifting, and hopeful. It's all these things and more!  What a group, what a people, what a concert!  :)
No wonder Celtic Woman are so successful worldwide!  (Meav's vocals/music in Asia is considered 'Healing Music.')  That's exactly what Celtic Woman's Music is. In this busy, harsh, and stressful world that we live in, Celtic Woman is like an Answered Prayer coming out of Heaven: their music just renews the soul and refreshes the mind, putting a smile back on your face and a relaxing sigh back in your heart.",1454803200,,4323,4.899862825788752
2702409,5,B000LC4CVA,"Big fan of the Celtic Woman and Celtic Thunder. This DVD of the Celtic Woman was great, and it is something I like to watch when there isn't anything decent on TV, which for me is 75% of the time.",1454716800,,196,3.925

2702447,5,B000LC4CVA,"Ihave not viewed this DVD yet but watched the live concert some time ago. As this is the same as the concert I watched on the PBS Broadcast System fundraiser, I already know it will be great. I had the pleasure of watching/listening to a live concert in Spokane, WA, a few months ago and firmly attest it was great, with four standing ovations and encores. These women and backup (especially drummers) are professionals and put on a show. The fiddler is especially brisk and lively and carries the show on her own. BUT the signers are also wonderful in their own unique styles. As a 72 year old man who's favorite singer is the beautiful, entertaining, and fun Katy Perry -- Celtic Woman is my next favorite music.

2702592,1,B000LC4CVA,"Added to my background video atmosphere at this year's St. Patrick's Day Party.
After 20 minutes, my guests were begging me to turn it off.
What's wrong with it?
It was not entirely the musical selection, it would have been tolerable,
but rather the presentation that was so repulsive.
It offended the sensibilities of my guests and I agreed with them.
Are they Celtic women? Hard to tell.
Celtic women don't have blonde hair, do they? These women do.
Is that Celtic music? Not sure; some sort of mutation thereofmaybe.
Wardrobe issues: What the  ?!
Apparently ""Celtic Women"" shop at Prostitute Boutique and Skank Outfitters.
Do not bother checking out this DVD; there's no reason to. It's horrible.",1426550400,,699,4.923728813559322

These super talented ladies, with their wonderful music sing like I imagine the angels in heaven will sing. There are many albums out, and I have bought five of them to play while reading on my Kindle. Their lilting Irish voices blend as one, high and pitch perfect. Calm but not insignificant. The songs are diverse and their interpretation sometimes makes me nearly weep. If you are looking for excellent music to relax by, instead of the racing rock that has its time and place as we age, look no further. Let these women's amazing, beautiful music accompany you while traveling, or just reading. It is joyful, calming, intelligent and pitch perfect. I am new to them, but will be a lifelong fan.

Second, capture a pixie that can play a fiddle like none other, even while twirling, skipping, running and dancing.  Third, Find a castle in the countryside of the Emerald Isle and turn it into a stage, complete with a full orchestra.  Fourth add wonderful percussionists high on turrets, fabulous and colorful gowns, David Downes on keyboards, a great production staff and a highly receptive audience.  Then mix in some spice in the form of the great Hayley Westenra.  Turn them loose for 24 of the most classic and revered Celtic tunes and you have more than an evening of entertainment.

I'm sure it's all the pretty girls, but he stopped to watch for a second.  He didn't get up again until the DVD had finished.

2702881,2,B000LC4CVA,"Where to begin?

This dvd has all the great Irish classic songs like Shenandoah and Scarborough Faire.

The music director has a truly great career ahead of him arranging elevator music. The music is sanitized of all the power of good Irish music in favour of cheesy staging that went out of style in the 1960's.

The female backup singers appear to have been dressed in the winners from ""Ireland's ugliest bridesmaid's dresses"" competition.

The female singers in this production are so very talented.  They deserve something better than this.",1384128000,,544,5.0

She has played Suzuki violin for over a year and wanted to take those lessons so she could dance around, flipping her long hair, just like the violinist with Celtic Women.

Celtic Woman is one of the rare occasions where a producer or producers put together an ensemble that really clicks,  and works out as well as Celtic Woman has done.  I have to admit that 'Orinoco Flow' is mesmerising and these ladies make Irish Gaelic sound so amazingly smooth and beautiful; the written language is almost impossible to pronounce,  and the language seems very difficult,  but they make it a wonder to hear!

2702948,5,B000LC4CVA,"I think this disc captures about the very best of the Celtic Woman troupe. All artists are at their prime in this DVD. With the exception of Chloe, who should have been a lot slimmer to be in the midst of those pretty girls. But more damaging was her ever constant holding-up of her dress, indicating she was not at ease wearing those beautiful feminine dresses.

Here, Hayley deserves a special mention. Despite her youth and being a new member of the troupe, she performed exceptionally well. She had the voice, look and style to make up for whatever shortcomings there were in this DVD. Hayley's soft femininity supplemented the regal Meav. As Lisa's sweetness complemented Orla. As for their singing voices, what more can one ask for. Except perhaps if Celtic Woman could persuade Suzan Erens (Holland) to join them.

Overall this DVD earns the full five stars.",1358899200,,865,4.798657718120805

2702972,5,B000LC4CVA,"thoroughly enjoyed the celtic woman: a new journey--live at slane castle.  oh, to be in the audience.  this is a delightful dvd that i will play often. especially when i need my spirits lifted.

i especially enjoyed the bit of choreography blended with the vocals for both the stars of the show and the choir.  as i work my way through their catalogue with my voice teacher, i have the artist in my head singing along which helps tremendously.

now if they would perform in either redding, california or ashland, oregon so it would be easy to go and enjoy their performance.

2702989,5,B000LC4CVA,"ANJ  is a pure joy from start to finish. Their first concert at the Helix was good enough for people to want to hear more, but ANJ put the Celtic Cuties at a new level. From a rousing opening number to the inspirational finale- everything was executed with beauty and precision.  Mairead Nesbitt is a fairy-like wizard with a stringed instrument. Lisa Kelly's ""Caledonia"" is the song that made me fall in love with her. Chloe does not disappoint. Orla is sweet with her ""Kerrickfergus"".  Hayley Westenra simply blows the audience away with her two solos. And MY last but not least is the incomparable Meav Ni Mhaolchatha!  Her ""Dulaman"" is fun and flirty and beautiful. Her ""Danny Boy"" is the standard for all other attempts at this song. And Meav's duet with Hayley, ""The Last Rose Of Summer""  is still the best CW duet to this day. And there have been plenty of great ones to follow. David Downes is the producer/director- a sensitive, quiet genius who knows how to make all those wonderful ingredients work well together. A must have for any Celtic music fan The only negative thing is relatively minor and that is that on my DVD, the ""closed captioning"" doesn't work.  Otherwise the DVD is of adequate quality production- wise.",1340409600,2,1231,4.702325581395349

This is a great performance performed by a marvelous orchestra and six very beautiful and very talented ladies!!!!! Their voices are simply angelic!!

I am looking forward to seeing this group in person as soon as they come near my area.  I feel uplifted and truly entertained every time I look at this DVD and listen to their beautiful performances and song renditions.  It is with profound pleasure that I rate this group as one of the best female vocal groups in the world!  David Downes, their conductor, is magnificent in his leadership of this group.  He presents them in a most favorable light and shows off their vocal skills magnificently.  What joy I derive every time I see and hear this group sing.

2702996,4,B000LC4CVA,"The setting (Slane Castle) was impressive and added great atmosphere to the performance.
The members of Celtic Woman have varied and beautiful voices, and the pieces they sang demonstrated their skills, singly and as a group.
I have loved the fiddler since I watched her with Michael Flatley's troup. Her skill is fantastic, and she looks like she is having the best time!
The beautiful and colorful costumes and gowns, the talented instrumentalists, plus the ancient background make this a memorable and enjoyable treat for ears and eyes.
The only things I found lacking were: more enthusiasm and participation from the audience,(or perhaps I am just used to American audience response, and found the Irish more subdued in contrast); and a bit of Irish step-dancing would have rounded out the show!
Anyway, a great, entertaining DVD.",1328486400,,834,5.139705882352941

2703018,3,B000LC4CVA,"The setting was fantastic and most of the music was equally wonderful. The ladies just have such beautiful voices. As with all of the Celtic Woman DVDs, there is no option for closed caption.  Most of the music does not need it. However, again as with all of their DVD releases, there are some songs that do - at least for those of us with hearing impairments.  While I love the music, this will probably be the last one I purchase, and it is simply because they use a recording company that refuses to try and meet the needs of many people that could use the closed caption option.

I did not appreciate their dresses with breasts hanging out, or low cut dresses.  The violinist does not wear a slip so at times, if she is in the right light you can see-through her dress.  Very immodest and offensive.  They have such sweet voices, but all that sweetness is turned to trash by the what they wore.  I did not appreciate my husband receiving this as a gift.

My favorite is 'Spanish Lady' in which all five voicalists (Chloe, Orla, Hayley, Lisa, and Meav) and Mairead the super energic vilolinist/dancer participate.

I have tried to enter my comments on the Celtic Women website but there is no place to do so. If the subtitles had been present I would have rated this DVD 5 Stars.",1276387200,,749,5.198347107438017

2703097,5,B000LC4CVA,"Came across Celtic Woman through browsing Youtube choral groups. There was a freshness and purity about the singing that put the group way ahead of others I had listened to. Tone, pitch, production were so well matched and blended so well, with no one trying to outshine the others, that it was a delight to listen to. Unity of voice and interpretation that would be very hard to match. The violin accompliment and solo peices from Mairead was like watching a sprite flit across the stage. The energy of the Irish music was matched by the singers to the point where it was impossible to keep my feet still. The Blane Castle concert gives my irish soul a lift every time I play it.

2703098,4,B000LC4CVA,"I picked this up as I had missed some of the songs from the original live performance that were not on the Greatest Journey DVD.  If you like Celtic Woman, you will love this one, as it has the original four vocalists (Chloe Agnew, Lisa Kelley, Orla Fallon, and Mav N Mhaolchatha), plus Hayley Westenra and, of course, the ""flying fiddler"", Mirad Nesbitt.  The setting is marvelous and the performances were outstanding.  There appear to be two versions of this DVD, with the one I have missing one track (Orinoco Flow?) that the other apparently has.  This was the only disappointing thing about the DVD.  The video is better than that of their most recent ""Songs from the Heart"" DVD that was apparently recorded in high-definition and then ""down-converted"" to standard DVD format.  None of that here, as the video is sharp and the audio is crisp and stunning.  This one should be in every Celtic Woman fan's video library.",1270598400,,924,4.7375

The show features Celtic Woman's strongest line-up yet with the inclusion of the STUNNING voice of Hayley Westenra.

The DVD also features Celtic Woman's best track-list to date. Whereas I found the other DVDs contained a few too many uninspired numbers, there are a truckload of terrific tracks on this little beauty. Impossible to pick a favourite.

The setting for this show at Slane Castle is a visual stunner.

The romantic setting of Slane Castle in Ireland coupled with the clear voices of Chloe Agnew, Hayley Westenra, Lisa Kelly, Meav Ni  Mhaolchath, and Orla Fallon with the incredible instrumentation of Mairead Nesbitt on fiddle, makes for a winning combination.
I can promise you that if you like Irish music this DVD is a ""must"" for your collection and it's one performance that you and your family will enjoy over and over again.",1267747200,,504,4.7272727272727275
2703115,5,B000LC4CVA,"About 4 years ago I was wandering around a large DVD store where I work in Lower Manhattan.  It was St. Patrick's Day week and they had a DVD playing on the tvs in the store of some lovely women singing various songs, together as a group and by themselves.  I recognized some like ""Beyond the Sea"" and ""Over the Rainbow,"" others I did not know.  I probably should have bought the DVD there and then, but I did not.  The next day I went back again and the same DVD was playing.  I purchased it this time and so began my love affair with Celtic Woman.  Since that day, I have purchased all their other CDs and DVDs, I saw them in concert the last 2 years at Radio City and will be seeing them again at the end of this month and 2 weeks ago I was thrilled to meet them in a personal appearance in honor of the release of their latest CD and DVD.
I have watched ""A New Journey: Live at Slane Castle"" more times than I can count and it is impossible for me to say anything negative about it.  So I will just talk about some of my favorites.  First of all, 3 of the women on this DVD are no longer with Celtic Woman: Meav, Orla and Hayley.  However my favorite, Lisa Kelly, is promenently featured.  I have seen her do the songs ""Caledonia,"" ""The Blessing"" and ""The Voice"" probably hundreds of times, she is a beautiful and charismatic performer with a great voice and stage presence. (I was so excited at meeting her in person two weeks ago that I basically blacked-out on what I said to her.  She is just as lovely and as friendly in person, with that great smile, as she is on the DVDs.)  Meav, a beautiful blonde with a lovely soprano voice is always fun to watch with her fun and sexy number, ""Dulaman.""  If you want to hear two really beautiful voices, watch the duet between Meav and Hayley Westenra on ""Last Rose of Summer.""  Another fun song and dance number with Lisa, Meav and Orla Fallon is ""At the Ceili.""  It is wonderfully entertaining.  Chloe, the baby of the group, just keeps getting better and better and she has matured into a marvelous performer on the latest Celtic Woman DVD.  Hayley Westenra, already a star in her native New Zealand, does a lovely job with ""Scarborough Fair.""  I love the numbers where the girls all sing together: ""Spanish Lady,"" ""Sing Out,"" ""Mo Ghile Mear,"" and finale of each show ""You Raise Me Up.""  Finally what can you say about the beautiful blonde fiddler, Mairead Nesbitt?  To watch her dance around that stage, a massive bundle of energy in such a small body, playing that fiddle is a joyous thing indeed.  She is the heart and soul of this group.
I have never tried to review this DVD before because I love it too much.  If you have never seen this DVD before, you should purchase it immediately.  And you will become as entranced as I was when I first saw it four years ago.",1265846400,3,2822,4.283018867924528

His favorites are Chloe and Hayley: when they are on screen, he lays his head on my lap and can't stop smiling. We watch the concert quite often because he likes it so much, and I don't get tired of it either.",1259884800,,417,4.346153846153846
2703138,5,B000LC4CVA,"I have in my possession the Celtic Woman audio CD for awhile, but only recently purchased the DVD. I remember the emotion that came over me listening to the music two years ago while watching the tele, and me literally taken over by their music. The girls sing with all their heart and they are very talented. Songs that particularly struck a chord with me are 'New Grange', 'Granuailes Dance', 'Dulamann', 'Carrickfergus' and 'The Voice'.

I have only a sliver of Ulster-Scot ancestry in me but this album was all that it took to bring it out in a mighty roar or just the soul of someone who knows good music when he hears it.

If you cherish Irish culture as I do and appreciate songs of passion, feet that move to a tune (Mairead the Fiddler could easily be African American with her ability to dance, uninhibited), and the sound of a symphony in perfect rhythm then Celtic Woman is A MUST!

2703139,4,B000LC4CVA,"The PBS special, that I originally saw this concert on, had ""Orinoco Flow"" as the 4th track, but it's not here. More than that, the disc pauses in the place where the chapter should be. Unlike the other reviewer, when I ordered the DVD the track list had been updated and did not include ""Orinoco Flow""; however, I didn't notice. I just assumed this DVD had the full concert. Needless to say I was very disappointed.

This is the only reason I'm giving 4 stars. Otherwise it's a solid 5.

One odd thing I noticed is the DVD itself and its sleeve shows a copyright year of 2009! The concert was performed in 2006 with the DVD released in 2007. I don't know if this means it's simply been reissued (as with alot of DVDs) or if there's an older disc out there with the track on it.

UPDATE: I said the track list had been updated and ""Orinoco Flow"" was not included but as it turns out there are two listings for this DVD. One has the correct info and the other does not.",1258243200,,968,4.221621621621622
2703140,5,B000LC4CVA,"Extraordinary.  The Celtic Women at their best.  This will be an excellent reminder for those of you who have seen their show in Toronto few years ago.  The decor is almost the same despite the fact that, in Slane Castle, the show takes place outside in what seems to be a beautiful night. I particularly enjoyed Mairead, the fiddle female Elf for whom gravity is just a word or so it seems.  She is so light, so fairy like.

Off course, the rest of the troop, singers and musicians, is great too.  Without them, the show wouldn't be what it is, Excellent.

One can never go wrong when buying their music in whichever form.  But, seeing them, is such a delight.

The result is an entertaining show enhanced by the by the Aontas Choral ensemble and the Irish Film Orchestra.  When I was in Dublin, my Irish friends told me that most of the Irish people could sing (although the Welsh say that they are the best), well this DVD certainly proves it. I definitely recommend it to all real music lovers who like to hear angelic voices sing the likes of The Prayer, The Voice, You Raise Me Up and the sublime Panis Angelicus. These renditions are complimented by such lively pieces as Granuiale's Dance, Sing Out and Spanish Lady.

I'm not always a fan of the camera angles they used, but some of them were really interesting and were staged well. My big complaint is that they seemed to feature Chloe an awful lot. Not that she's bad or anything, but every other camera switch seemed to have Chloe, if there was any chance that she was on stage. She's a beautiful girl, but there are five other women on stage, too. :) I'd like to see their stage presence more.
And, I'm a musician. I want to see the orchestra and the background singers. I want to watch David Downes conduct. I really enjoy seeing different conductors' style and how they do cues and what-not, but that's probably because I also conduct.
The production is set beautifully. Slane Castle is a background to die for, and if you like Celtic Woman and their music, then yeah, you'll like it. If not, then you probably won't.",1249776000,,1004,4.521978021978022

Chloe with ""Panis Angelicus"" Maec in ""Danny boy and Dulaman"" and laast but nor least Orla in ""Newgrange and Carrickfergus"" The sheer talent of these five soloist is beyond compare but as a group they fit each other like a glove. Listen to ""Spanish Lady"" and ""You raise me Up""The first will have you laughing and the second crying. An Album for any serious music lover. And I even spoke about the energy and talent that Mairead brings to the stage. That little fiddle player has more energy than the Energizer bunny.

A  wonderfull DVD.  You can appreciate their wide  vocal range by listening to their West Side Story rendition done without musical accompaniment.
Before this, I couldn't believe a fiddler could dance and fiddle at the same time.
The setting at Slate Castle and the editing of the DVD was  excellent. If you listen carefully, you will see that the drummers(2) balance out the orchestra and singers beautifully.

My guess is that the people that will like this DVD and CD as a top five star rating would generally be a marginal audience of traditional Irish Music without the big stage production to sell it.  I suppose it is just a matter of taste and there is nothing wrong in liking big stage productions.  But there is also nothing wrong in a preference for Irish Traditional Music the Irish traditional way in a much simpler and friendlier pub style form as roots music.

Between the two projects of this producer, my preference would be High Kings.  That is a simpler production that includes a pub style sing along for the ""Irish Rover."" If there are more productions in the future, I would certainly encourage taking this direction.

I have been involved in playing and listening to Irish Traditional Music for decades.  The pub can offer what they call ""craic""  (pronounced ""crack"") in Ireland, or an atmosphere of community fun and friendship.  This was captured in Danu's DVD ""One Night Stand.""  This was captured in the Cheiftains DVD ""Water from the Well.""  This was captured in Dervish's two DVD's, ""Midsummers Night Session"" and ""Live from Johnny Fox's.""  On CD, this is captured on ""Music from Matt Molloy's.""  I would also have to say the DVD ""Ragus"" presents a small theatre production PERSONAL approach to the same type of music.

Mairead, the fiddler, has such a distinctive and beautiful style of playing I find myself (not literally) throwing rocks at other fiddlers. I don't believe she ever hits a bad note. The orchestra is also first-rate.

The individual voices of each of the performers were really lost in this production.  Between the background singer and the orchestra, it really destroyed the very thing that made them so attractive to me.  So very sad.",1219276800,,347,4.830508474576271

A beautiful and palpable chemistry among not only performers but also audience was presented and showed while the event took place.

My favorite vocalist was Hayley, though I also like Chloe and Meav.  And what can I say about Mairead?  She is a joy to watch, even on more solemn moments like when she accompanied Hayley on ""Lascia Chio Pianga"".  But one highlight for me was Lisa's singing ""The Voice"", rivaling ""Orinico Flow"" as my favorite cut.  I also enjoyed ""The Prayer"", ""Scarborough Fair"", the wonderful aca pella arrangement of ""Over The Rainbow"", ""Lascia Chio Pianga"", ""Spanish Lady"", ""Somewhere"", and ""You Raise Me Up"".",1209859200,,605,4.825242718446602

Helps us appreciate the work that went into/goes into it. Its agrivating that these women are still forced to all the 'fake staging' while they are singing. I guess that is done to make sure each of the stars get equal billing, equal face time? Their concert is amazing. The singing is incredible! Everything is so beautiful! Go out to see them if you can - but if you cant, get this dvd (and the previous one too!) and have a Celtic Woman night with your family or friends.",1209340800,,598,4.348214285714286

For this DVD I am likely to repeat me a little..., but before I will give my direct point of view, which I felt when I put it in reading: Very beautiful image 16/9, sound DTS!... Here all is splendid. set, the symphony orchestra, actors in general!. The voices is smooth but a great control of the spectacle, it are at the same time resting and leave a little the place with the daydream, any fate of the beaten paths!. I appreciated the title: ""Scarborough Fair"" well interpreted and... accompanied with harp!... sublime!. Title 13: ""Lascia Ch' io Pianga"" of the Baroque!, would not be this of George Frideric Handel?!. I appreciated to see again Mairad that I could see in truth in a spectacle of Michael Flatley: ""Feet of Flames"" a treat. For the continuation, the analysis is very close to the DVD of ""Celtic Woman"": Live At the Helix Center in Dublin, Ireland.

2703604,4,B000LC4CVA,"The Celtic Woman show, New Journey is a credit to the talents of the 6 beautiful women and to David Downes who arranges the show.  The addition of Haley Westenra is an added plus.  A solid performance all around and worth adding to your collection of Celtic Woman DVDs and CDs.

I noticed that there is a difference between the DVD and the PBS show in that there are different crowd shots and that the titles to the songs appear on the PBS version before each song and not on the DVD version.

In addition the Celtic Woman company offers a 17 minute video on the DVD. entitled ""Behind the Scenes at Slane Castle"".  This was excellent and I would like to see much more of this inside look.

My chief fault is not with the show or any of the outstanding performances from the girls, but with the producers of the DVD.  There is a glitch between songs at about the 57 minute mark which causes the DVD to freeze for a moment.  While it does not occur during any performance but rather during an crowd applause shot, it is highly annoying as speaks to poor quality control on the part of whoever mastered the DVD.  I returned the first copy of the DVD I received hoping this was just a fluke, only to find that the fault exists on the replacement copy I received.  In light of what you have to pay for a DVD at full price this kind of sloppy production control is uncalled for.  This sort glitch also appears on the DVD ""Christmas Celebration"" at the 51 minute mark.  I fully realize that edits have to be made to a concert DVD to weed out excess time but these cuts should be seamless and not distracting to the enjoyment of the performance.

If you can tolerate this glitch then add the DVD to your collection.  If not wait for a used copy to be offered for sale.

I rate the performance a 4 out of 5 only because of the poor way in which the DVD was made and not a reflection in anyway of the performance of the girls.",1198713600,2,1916,4.210958904109589

2703651,5,B000LC4CVA,"This dvd is one of my newest but already  it has earned its place as my favorite, one I will never let go. My husband and I saw parts of it months ago on the PBS special. We liked it and looked around found it on Amizon. For some reason or another we couldn't buy it right then. Flash forward many months. My husband has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's Disease. We have been hospitalized for several months, several hours away from home and friends. (Well, he has, but I stayed there with him the whole time.) One day in October,I was puttering around on the computer and I came across the link I had saved for this dvd, and I ordered it. By the time it came and I drove home to get it it was almost Halloween. When I brought it to his room, he insisted that we watch it immediately. By this point in his disease proccess he was unable to stay awake for very long, unable to stay focused very long. He was scared, because he knew his body was dying around his brilliant, beautiful mind. From the moment this dvd started, the first strains of music, the first girls began to sing, he was captivated. He did not drift off or waver away from the performance even once. These women have such gifts, but I am sure they don't know what a gift they shared with my husband and I that night, and for several nights to follow. For just a few hours, we were not in a hospital, we were not battling a terminal illness, we were just us again.
Music, theatre and performing had been my husbands whole life, and this concert was able to take him back to that place. We watched and listened to the dvd many times over the next week and a half. On Sunday evening, November 11, he was tense, tremoring, wouldn't wake up, but couldn't seem to rest either. I put in the dvd of Celtic Woman. From the first notes of the music he visably began to relax. While all of the ladies were singing You Raise Me Up, though I thought him to be asleep or unconscious, a tear rolled down his cheek. I let the concert play at a low volume the rest of the night and the next day. He remained calm and peaceful throughout. At about 4:45pm,November 12, my husband laid down his arms and stopped fighting, went quietly with death as if it were an old friend come to lead him home. He will always be a part of me, and I will always be greatful to Celtic Woman for making his last days peaceful ones.

Ok, as for a critical review, the music is breathtaking. The women all sing beautifully, each bringing their own unique sound to the table.  Mairead is one of the most talented fiddle performers I have yet to see. And you will note that I say fiddle performer, not fiddle player, because she does not mearly play, she truly performs, flying across the stage and all about dancing and jumping while never missing a note as she is playing. The show is visually pleasing, stimulating yet soothing. The set is well thought out, suitably showcases the ladies, but also the many parts of the band and the choir. The use of so  many cameras and great angles make you feel as if you are really there, and assures that each person involved gets their moment on film.  I give it 5 stars! It is deserving of more, but that is all that is available on the Amazon reviews! BRAVO!!!",1195171200,7,3231,4.264274061990212

What do these vapid, lip-syncing, saccharin elevator-Muzak Stepford Wives have to do with Celtic anything? It's like the Brady Bunch morphed with Laurence Welk on St. Patrick's Day in Disney World. Very scary and artificial; having absolutely nothing to do with the spirit of good Celtic music that I love. Run away as fast as you can and find some real Celtic music elsewhere if you have a micron of good taste. You'll not find it here. Yikes!",1194825600,9,534,4.752688172043011
2703653,5,B000LC4CVA,"We saw the show on PBS and just had to send for the DVD. It's an absolute delight and we loved it. My husband is english and I am german, and this type of music, combined with the flavor of ancient days, is right up our alley. Especially when it is so well done.",1194480000,,262,3.8703703703703702
2703654,5,B000LC4CVA,"To hear Chloe, Hayley, Lisa, Mairead, Meav and Orla even once is to understand why the Ladies of `Celtic Woman' have spent 100+ weeks in the #1 position of the music charts. To see them against the background of historic Slane Castle, the site of musical concerts going back decades, is a treat to the senses far better experienced than described.
 From their introductory collective `The Sky and the Sea and the Sun' through the evocative `You Raise Me Up' they carry the viewer as a participant on a magical tour that will have even the most jaded coming back for more.
 Mairead: If you have only heard this powerhouse on CD you might imagine she performs standing still; nothing could be further from the truth! This dynamic sprite seems to fly across the multi-level stage, performing with boundless enthusiasm that draws the audience in from her first instants and holds them for a stunning collection of performances. This All Ireland Fiddle Champion makes the difficult appear easy; her `Granvaile's Dance' is a joyous romp that will leave you breathless; her every appearance carries with it a boundless energy that sweeps the stage and audience in staggering counterpoint to the stately moves of her companions, while her counter punctual `Shenandoah' and `Pacific Slope' showcase her talent and must be seen to be appreciated.
 Chloe's `The Prayer' will move you to tears; her melodious voice carries a fine depth of emotion, while her rendition of `Panis Angelicus' is equally at home in a towering cathedral or small chapel.
 When Lisa sings `I don't know if you can see the changes that have come over me' she is telling us more than her longing for `Caledonia'; to look at her is to understand the biggest change of all. Filmed in August 2006, this delightful lady was expecting a great gift indeed. (#3 is due in March 2008, which is one reason she is resting during the American tour.) The longing she conveys in `Caledonia' is poignant, while her `Blessing' is filled with such love you feel she is speaking directly to you.
 As Orla tells us of `Newgrange' she brings us back to the days of Druids and mystic Temples, her stunning voice carrying us willingly to a world of past glory. Fluent in Gaelic, as are several of the others, many of her performances are in that evocative language; you do not really need to know the words to be carried by the feeling (though [...] does provide translations). Her `Carrickfergus', when she accompanies herself on the Irish Harp, carries such emotion you long to be with her to its sad end.
 Meav's `Dulaman' is just one of the Gaelic renditions which this stunning lady brings out in all its beauty so well that you do not need to know the story of love to be swept along by it. `Danny Boy' never fails to arouse emotion and she carries heartache and longing with a voice that fills the room and the heart.
 Hayley's crystal voice brings new depth to familiar favorites such as `Scarborough Fair' while her `Lascia Ch'io Pianga' evokes heartache and the longing for true love.
 Their multitude of varying combinations not only showcase their ability to work as a team but carries their individuality as well. Even when singing in chorus each lady's voice can be heard, more a cooperative effort that one of being subsumed into the whole.
 The delight these ladies bring to their performances brings you into the scene with them, but whether collectively or individually there is no `Lead Performer'; whether through the wistfulness of `Over the Rainbow' or the joyousness of `Sing Out' or the unabashed sexiness of `At the Ceilli' or `Spanish Lady', they are Celtic Woman.",1193529600,4,3632,4.789137380191693

But when I sat down to watch it with her I enjoyed it so much that I made her watch it again with me. Their harmony is so smooth that even when they are singing a capella you at first think the orchestra is still playing. Their harmonic version of Over the Rainbow is so magnificent that Judy Garland will be spinning in her grave at 500 rpm!",1192579200,,426,3.9651162790697674

I am really upset about it because I may have easily just stored them until December and then sent them out to people I love - who may or may not have let me know they were blanks.

If you are a sound or production tech, I highly recommend watching this just for the quality of the recording, micing, and staging. I personally would have EQed the violin a little differently, but everything else was a wonderful natural sound.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the sound was a few microseconds off from the video. Hardly noticeable to the average viewer, but extremely annoying to those of us who do notice. Also, there are no subtitles, but it has a subtitle track. The subtitle tract doesn't work, but it is there.

I can just imagine the irritation of those who sweated and agonized over making this such a wonderful presentation only to have the DVD processing company mess up the sound sync, and the subtitles.

Perhaps they fixed these flaws in later releases of the DVD, but I've verified that the version I have is due to a production problem. It isn't due to a flawed disk, or DVD player.",1189641600,,1069,4.552083333333333

2703833,2,B000LC4CVA,"This DVD (not so much the CD) really is a bit over the edge....The Stepford Wives Do Celtic Music???...the guy pounding away wildly on the drums...the 3,000 extra singers...the constant awkward fashion show runway walk down the stage....the costume changes..the castle....waaaaaaaaaay over the top for my tastes...and the inappropriate CONSTANT switches to the audience reaction...this entire production was monsterous....I know that I will be the ONLY person who makes any of these points and that PBS stations from L.A. to the Suez Canal will broadacast this thing forever in membership drives... but this DVD is just not crafted to these wonderful singers....I just couldn't believe it.

I have every CD any of these women have done individually and I would highly recommend those CD's along with the original DVD and all the Celtic Woman CD's....but this DVD is so bad.

This is CELTIC music which relies more on simplicity and beauty...it was like sitting in a dentist chair WATCHING the tremendously talented Haley Westenra suddenly be thrown into this group as if she needed to do this to advance her own career....it was shocking if you have followed Haley's career over the last few years to see her as part of this overblown mess..I think this was a step backwards for her.  She seemed out of place.

The gal jumping around with the fiddle like some sort of adult elf was just about the ""my god, what next?"" limit for me...until they focused on the wild bore Caliban guy trying to break his drums...banging away like he was smashing huge boulders.....

Looks like a bunch of Wall Street people got a hold of good thing (as they did with the Olympics and soon with NASCAR) and then said if a little is good..than an avalanche of it is better...no matter if it descends into bad taste...

The ""good thing"" here are gorgeous women who can sing very well.....that should have been enough on its own merits but instead what we get here on this DVD is every cliche known to man.

Cringe...and then cringe some more...

Sure it will sell but I hope the next time around all those handlers understand the words subtle and nuance. This  DVD is like watching a war documentary.  Again..the music on the CD is OK..but this DVD uber production is just so overblown that it leaves you dazed and beaten up...how they could have managed to do that with Celtic music is nearly criminal.",1181692800,6,2380,4.782926829268293

Anyway, this is a really good collection of music, and the performance is good enough to warrant owning both the DVD and the CD.

A word of advice--if you want to buy the CD as well, buy the one with bonus tracks--some of the best songs of the show (such as At the Ceili and Spanish Lady, as well as Mairead's Shenandoah) are only on that CD.

I am still amazed at how well Mairead can play the violin--while running around (barefoot, usually) on the stage. Chloe, Hayley, Lisa, Meav, and Orla are all incredible singers, and the background singers and instrumentalists are terrific as well.

Lovely to look at; wonderful to hear, Celtic Woman is a group worth seeing and I'm pleased to be able to say that my wife and I just saw them live and couldn't have been more pleased.  If you cannot get to one of their concerts, owning this DVD is the next best thing.

I challenge you to watch /listen to this DVD without tapping your foot or nodding your head in rhythm to the music.  It is just one of those things.  The Celtic Women don't hurt your eyeballs to watch either.

I have given their CD's to two people so far and will probably do so again.  They make excellent gifts.  I'd give the DVD's but the CD's are cheaper.

I must admit that while I do like this title, their first production (smartly performed inside) made the bigger impression on me. While the girls still did a great job, the cool evening weather just barely affected them I think. If I can see their breath on video, they must have been cold. The song selection remained varied. Still Irish in nature, not as many tracks as in the original would be 'recognized' by the casual listener. That's okay though, after all a sequal often is intended for the avid fan who already is fancied with the group. Then again I may just be fancied with Lisa ;-) Either way, I was happy with the purchase and having it as an addition to the collection. You will too!",1178928000,,781,4.3561643835616435

The orchestration was as beautiful as ever, as were the singers themselves, but I found the selection of music to be disappointing (Over the Rainbow?) after the notable hits in their first concert. The best numbers this time were the three repeats from their original recording (Oronoco Flow, Danny Boy and You Raise Me Up). I'm sorry to say that frequent costume changes and more of Mairead's energetic and beautiful fiddling couldn't compensate for an uninspiring repertoire.",1178668800,7,641,5.114285714285714

With the 23 cuts on the DVD, there is something for everyone.

These women have such pure tones.  A true joy to listen to and the fiddler is just fun with her antics.  All eye candy and not bad on the ears either.  How old is Chloe now?

I hadn't seen Celtic Woman before, but I knew of them through my music teacher, so this second concert was the first I'd seen. My mother got me the CD and I listen to it all the time. It's in my car, on my mp3 player, on my computer, and I watch the DVD all the time. The girls sound like angels and everything is so tasteful and beautiful it really does spoil you for all other types of musical performances. CW was just recently in my home town and I wasn't planning on seeing them in person, but a friend of mine was so my mother and I got togehter with my friend and her mom and I was BLOWN AWAY! Everything was PERFECT! The songs, the beautiful dresses, the instrumentalists, the lights, everything! So now I'm on a Celtic Woman high and hopefully I never come down off it. It's so wonderful and peaceful. You have to see this and if you get the chance to see them live, go for it. The new addition of Hayley Westenra is lovely, too. I am now a big fan of hers. She stands out quite a bit among Meav, Orla, Chole, Lisa and Mairead. Check all of their solo CDs out too! You'll be pleased!",1176076800,2,1169,4.064935064935065

But what made it so great was the outstanding performances of the ""Girls"". ""A New Journey,"" does not have the cozy, personnal feel of the original. But the ""Girls"" do an even better job of presenting these beautiful arrangements in a more dramatic way. The Slane Castle and set are terrific, the costumes are fabulous, the ""Girls"" could not be more lovely and conductor David Downs and crew are truly spectactular. Every detail has been carefully thought out. I do not know of anything out there, that compares with the experience you will have, over and over, as you watch this video.

The scenery, being in front of a real castle, gave the show a special feel of magic. The special features at the end of the DVd give an insight into what it takes for a production like this to come together.

2704274,5,B000LC4CVA,"Incredible! Fabulous! Phenomenal! Since receiving this CELTIC WOMAN LIVE AT SLANE CASTLE DVD, I have not only all but wore this out but also got to catch CELTIC WOMAN live in concert (in Uncasville, CT and Nashville, TN). They are unbelievable! I can't get enough. In fact, rather than flying back to Connecticut after the Nashville show, as I was scheduled to do, I instead got on a plane for Raleigh, NC, to see them two more times there! (In Raleigh, ROW A both nights, literally four feet from the edge of the Stage and six feet from the girls)! Now, having seen CELTIC WOMAN live in concert four times, in a matter of three weeks time no less, all I can say is ... oh my God! Angels! If you have any kind of heart at all, how on earth can you NOT fall in love with these six Angels? Angels sent straight from Heaven. Unbelievable voices and talent! Wonderful performers. All the lovely ladies of CELTIC WOMAN possess much talent and all have done tons of work of this very nature. They all have solo albums, some have performed in theatre and does it ever show when they are on stage, right before your very eyes. Tremendously beautiful ladies, tremendously beautiful voices, stunning gowns worn by the ladies. The stage sets and backdrops and all the lighting is incredible! David Downes has done a remarkable job. CELTIC WOMAN has in fact opened up a whole new world to me, a world of new music as well as a world of Irish/Celtic/Gaelic history. Buy their CDS and DVDS (especially the most recent ... Live At Slane Castle DVD) ... AND ... go see them live, if you possibly can, while they are still (as of this writing) on Tour all over the USA and Canada. This is remarkable talent folks. You could not have imagined voices so beautiful could ever exist. I never fell in love with any musical performers as fast as I did these lovely, talented ladies.

The backdrop at the Slane Castle really adds to the ambiance, and the cameras do a great job of capturing close up and all the action.  At the Ceili is my favorite; it's just fun to watch the routine and costumes.  I think what really sells this for me is that everyone genuinely appears to love performing the songs, and the five voices and fiddle are just fantastic by themselves and together they equal more than the sum of the individuals.",1174780800,,612,4.342105263157895

I believe that if that person could adjust their dvd player, they too would have no problem.  Many people do not know that you can do that.

This works best for me as something to have on at the end of the day.  One doesn't have to watch it intently; it serves as a good audio/visual wallpaper while one winds down.

Whern it finished, we played it again. And again the next day. No kidding. This is powerful, lovely stuff that will move you, regardless of your heritage or ancestry.

2704518,5,B000LC4CVA,This was a great presentation which I originally saw on public television.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered a copy of the DVD for myself and ordered two more as gifts.  The music is wonderful and the setting (Slane Castle) unique.  It's a great program for anyone who's drawn to Ireland and it's music.,1173312000,,306,4.428571428571429

2704520,5,B000LC4CVA,"First, I'll review the negatives:

1) As a singer, I was quite disappointed with the way the girls are directed to perform - their chests are puffed out and their arms are held painfully bent behind their backs. It's just poor technique and visually unappealing.

2) The costume designer has serious fashion issues. While some of the dresses are very fitting and attractive, the ones that weren't lovely were beyond terrible. For example, what's worse than a giant gold ball gown, a big purple bow at the bust and a white lace shawl on the heaviest of the girls (Chloe)? She's a beautiful girl, has a sweet voice, and she actually has a fine figure - but the costumes make her look quite large. They also put extensions in her hair that looked quite fake.

3)The choreography was very ""stagey"". It was too rehearsed, not only in the group numbers, but in the girls' solos. They all have such beautiful and distinct voices, I would have liked to have seen their individual performing styles as well.

But, before you think I'm a total Nazi...If you're Celtic Woman fan, this DVD is a must have. It's filmed at the lovely Slane Castle in Ireland - the perfect place for a concert. It is visually just stunning. The music is absolutely gorgeous, made even better by their very talented fiddle player (whose very Irish name I won't even attempt to spell!) She's like a little wood nymph! The ladies are bright and beautiful and are in top vocal form. I am so pleased with the addition of Hayley Westenra to the Celtic Woman clan. She was a treasure in this show.

2704612,5,B000LC4CVA,"The original Celtic Woman concert music spent more than 80 weeks on the number 1 spot on Billboard's world music chart.  There is no doubt that this album will claim that spot also.  This concert filmed at legendary Slane Castle in Ireland in August 2006 is a masterpiece.  David Downes has once again shown his brilliance in bringing traditional Irish and contemporary tunes together is a delightful performance that you will watch over and over again.  Chloe Agnew's The Prayer is absolutely beautiful and flawless.  Mairead Nesbitt's Granuaile's Dance is spirited and has the audience absorbed in the music.  Mairead's energy is contagious and just adds to the fact that she is a first class fiddle player.  Lisa Kelly with her captivating smile and grace are highlighted in Caledonia and The Voice.  Orla Fallon's haunting rendition of Carrickfergus will stir your soul as if she is plucking the strings of your heart.  Meav Ni Mhaolchatha's  rendition of Dulaman and Danny Boy show her mastery of the Irish language and feeling that go into making an Irish tune alive with feelings, warmth, and soul.

The addition of Hayley Westenra as the 6th Celtic Woman this year is certainly icing on the cake.  Her rendition of Scarborough Faire is amazing.  Normally I don't like it when people do this song, but Hayley sings it with such passion that you will be speechless.

The truth is, there are 6 beautiful Irish ladies with extraordinary voices and abilities, 12 exceptional background vocalists, an orchestra of the highest class of musicians, and one brilliant and talented composer/conductor all assembled for a night of exceptional tunes that you will be humming and singing for days after.  You will feel as though you are right there as part of the audience at Slane Castle when you watch this video.  Buy this DVD and prepare to be amazed by beauty, grace and music that can only be described as ""a little bit of heaven.""",1172707200,15,1931,4.877300613496932

2704644,5,B000LC4CVA,"Ever since they began conquering the world a couple years back (or at least the part of it that watches PBS) Celtic Woman has owned the top spot of the Billboard World chart, with each disc knocked off only by their own projects. This concert will only further entrench them in that position. It is utterly fantastic.

Even with those breakout CD sales, the core of their success has lain in their concert presentation. The CDs have been like talismans that invoke the concert experience and keep it fresh until you have time to sit and watch it again. But the stage is where they truly rule.

The first video was beautiful, ethereal, and occasionally almost spiritual. But ""A New Journey"" adds one more element: Fun! Only fiddler Mairead Nesbitt did any real moving and shaking in the original. The vocalists were - apart from gracefully walking up and down ramps - fairly static. This actually lent itself to the otherworldly quality of the show but also subtracted color from the ladies' personalities.

Well, they are alive and in living color in this show. The greatest benefit goes, hands down, to Lisa Kelly. More than the other vocalists, who hearken primarily from classical and traditional roots, Kelly's background is predominantly in musical theater. Her skills in dramatic presentation, audience connection, and dance are unleashed here and she absolutely relishes it. And Nesbitt? Her already energetic presentation takes off into the utterly dynamic.

This shift is apparent in all the performances. Meav Ni Mhaolchatha, only months removed from maternity leave, seems to find a whole new level of projection and assurance and it suits her. And the addition of the nearly operatic Hayley Westenra gooses everyone's vocal game up another notch.

If I have any nit to pick, it may be in the set list's frontloading of the new material. But that's a minor quibble. All in all, it's very impressive.",1171670400,8,1910,4.95625
2704645,2,B000LC4CVA,"I must say that I was very disappointed with this DVD; perhaps the young ladies had reached such heights with their original DVD and show Celtic Woman, they could only fall to the earth. I have viewed the original DVD so many times the DVD actually skips.

After absolutely enjoying the concert when they visited the D.C. area and wearing out the original DVD, I assumed this was the reason they had chosen to includ Hayley Westenera. I am an admirer of her work as well her piece de resistance being Pure; so I received this DVD with great anticipation.

What a disappointment; so disappointed that I have viewed this DVD only once. The performances were hollow, contrived and uninspired in stark contrast to the original DVD. The muzzle that was placed upon Hayley Westenra was puzzling. I'm very happy that I bought this product at a reduced price on Amazon; had I paid full price I would have been pi..ed.

Lisa was beautiful as always, singing ""Caledonia"", ""The Blessing"" and ""The Voice"". Meav was outstanding in ""Dulamen"", ""Last Rose of Summer"", and ""Danny Boy"". Orla, with her mysterious voice, sang ""Newgrange"" and while playing her harp sang ""Carrickfergus""; both pieces brought chills up and down my spine. Chloe, seventeen now, and always a crowd pleaser, sang ""The Prayer"" and ""Panis Angelicus"". Mairead, who always gets the crowd going, played ""Granualle's Dance"" and ""Shenanduah-The Pacific Slope"". She sure can play the violin and move at the same time. Quite a sight to see!! Then there is Hayley Westenra, the new celtic women. She sang beautifully ""Scarborough Fair"", ""Lascia Ch'io Pianga"" and also sang  ""The Last Rose Of Summer"" with Meav.

The opening piece ""The Sky and the Dawn and the Sun"" was sung by all and Mairead played her violin. It was so moving to see!! Other pieces as ""Orinoco Flow"", ""Over The Rainbow"", ""Beyond the Sea"", ""At the Ceili"", ""Sing Out"", ""Spanish Lady"", ""Somewhere"", ""Mo Ghile Mear"", and ""You Raise me Up"" were done by four or all five women.

I can see doing ""You Raise Me Up"" again because that is their ""Good-bye"" song, but ""Somewhere"", ""Orinoco Flow"". and ""Danny Boy were on the first Celtic Women, and I would of perferred different songs instead of the same. That was the only thing I found disappointing.

Also, at the end, when the other women got their flowers, I will always wonder if Mairead got floweres too??? Carrying her violin and flowers would of been awkward, I know, but she could of managed it. She did such a superb job throughout the show, she deserved flowers too!!!!",1171152000,4,1758,4.909090909090909
2704673,5,B000LC4CVA,"... because it is difficult to pick a starting point.

I think my DVD is nearly worn out already- and I have only had it for a few days...

I was originally utterly blown away by the original Celtic Woman DVD, so when ""A New Journey"" was announced, I was almost beside myself. Not just at the thought of more from the 5 girls, but the fact Hayley Westenra was to join them. Now, being a Kiwi, I am unashamedly biased when it comes to Hayley. That lass is pure golden syrup for your ears! So her inclusion in this new production is so much more than just an added bonus for me. Dare I say it, but her vocal prowess almost upstages the other 4 vocalists...

The next delight was to see Mirad Nesbitt getting considerably more stage time. It would be criminal to give her any less of a presence in anything she is involved with. Her performance here would have to be her best on DVD so far- and I have been an avid fan since I first saw her in Lord of the Dance. She is just fantastic. As an earlier reviewer commented, it is almost worth buying the DVD for her performance alone: dancing, twirling, spinning, duelling with bodhrans or gracefully providing a lead-in for some of the slower pieces, she is easily one of the finest Celtic fiddlers in existance.

Overall, however, this definately at least as good as the original concert. Lisa excells herself, giving the impression that she is really enjoying herself. Mav still has a real mischievous sparkle in her eye, especially when she is singing in Gaelic. The only piece I am not particularly fussed with, is the same on both DVD's: ""Orinoco Flow"". To my mind, it lacks the depth of Enya's original- it sounds like they are merely skittering around the top of it. But, to be fair, there would be little point them replicating Enya perfectly. It would defeat the purpose of them performing it at all, if they cannot put their own slant on it, I suppose. Everything else is simply fantastic. A rating of 10 out of 5 stars.

No, once you adjust to the new setting (and Slane Castle does provide a very picturesque backdrop), you will be spellbound. If you are not, then you probably have wooden ears and glass eyes...

I am already impatient for the next show.",1171152000,5,2211,4.433497536945813

Though not present, I also count once part timer Dierdre Shannon as she subbed for Meav in the live performance I was fortunate to see in 2005.

Now, several people have metioned that in this performance like Celtic Woman v. 1, the girls lip synced all the songs.  I noticed towards the end of this DVD it seemed more apparent than ever.  Logistics in mind, this  is NOT an unusual tactic with such a large scale interpretation involving so many singers and musicians.  Same goes in the making of a movie musical where all singing is lip synced.

2704679,5,B000LC4CVA,"Celtic Woman: A New Journey by [...] ~ Miami, Florida

They are young, they are beautiful, full of life and full of talent:  The Celtic Woman just released a second album: ""A New Journey""

In their first concert, they were only five girls: four vocalists and a violinist, a wonderful creature fallen from Heaven for our utmost happiness.  If Paradise exists, I picture it full of angels like Mirad Nesbitt (not necessarily 77 for each warrior...) playing harp or violin!  This is a small blonde with wonderful long hair (I would swim across the Atlantic just to see that hair!) who reminds me of all the poets I have read evoking the nymphs of the woods:  She hops, she jumps, she smiles, she turns like a spinning top, while mastering her fiddle like Paganini.  She alone would justify the purchase of this DVD.

But there is more.  A fifth vocalist (Hayley Westenra) has joined the original four (Chlo Agnew, rla Fallon, Lisa Kelly and Mav N Mhaolchatha).  All of them are lovely, have great voices, and sing in great harmony.

The concert opens with a presentation of the six girls plus David Downes, the Musical Director.  This is followed by a beautiful view of Slane Castle in Ireland, where the concert is staged, under a violin melody played by angel Mirad.  All five vocalists soon join her in a beautiful song with a rich orchestration.

Unlike Andr Rieu's concerts, where numbers are often separated by Andr's jokes or explanations, there is no wasted time here.  The public is still applauding that the next number is already rolling.  The whole concert is thus only 1h30; a plus for businessmen in a hurry...  All others will be able to run it twice after dinner, as I did myself last night.  A supplement shows lovely views of Ireland and Slane Castle.

You will hear immortal songs like the ""Orinoco Flow"" (Number 5), ""Scarborough Fair"" (No. 8, interpreted by the newcomer: Hayley Westenra), ""Over the Rainbow"" (No. 10), followed by ""Beyond the Sea"" (11), ""The Last Rose of Summer"" (No. 17), ""Somewhere"" (the famous song from ""West Side Story"", No. 22) and this masterpiece called ""You Raise Me Up"", which closes the show.

Most numbers are richly orchestrated with plenty of drums and a choir in the background, like ""Caledonia"" (No. 3), ""Newgrange"" (No. 4), the ""Orinoco Flow"", ""Dlaman"" (No. 6), At the Cili"" (No. 12), ""Sing Out"" (No. 15) or ""Spanish Lady"" (No. 18).  These few numbers alone would justify the purchase of this DVD, but I think I already said that about Mirad...

There are a few notable exceptions like ""The Blessing"" (No. 7), interpreted by Lisa Kelly with a discrete piano melody by David Downes, ""Lascia Ch'io Pianga"" (No. 13), a languorous classical melody with lots of violins in the background or ""Carrickfergus"" (No. 14) interpreted by rla Fallon while she plays the harp, or ""Panis Angelicus"" (No. 16), interpreted by Chlo Agnew accompanied by a violoncello and soft violins, with a discrete choir jumping in later on.  And let's not forget ""Shenandoah"" (No. 19), a violin solo by Mirad (no jumping this time: she is grave like a grown up person) with David at the piano.

Remember the famous ""Over the Raimbow"", created by Judy Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz"" in 1939 and wonderfully interpreted by Suzan Erens in Andr Rieu's ""The Flying Dutchman""?  Well, you will hear a new version ""a cappella"" by four of the girls.  And, trust me, you won't miss the orchestra.  They will do it again with the famous ""Somewhere"".

When I was fifteen (many, many, many moons ago...) my professor of classical guitar in Havana used to say that the best number is always the one that closes the show.  Well, this is still the case.  Just like the first concert, this one ends with the same number: a masterpiece written by Rolf Loveland and Brendan Graham and made famous by Josh Groban titled ""You Raise Me Up"":  ""I am strong when I am on your shoulders, you raise me up to more than I can be.""

But, after all, didn't Oscar Wilde say it already in ""The Portrait of Dorian Gray""?:  ""Aimer c'est se surpasser"" said the French translation that I read with my students in Paris ~ To love is to transcend yourself.",1170547200,26,4136,4.684210526315789

2704712,5,B000LC4CVA,"Celtic Woman opened my eyes to Celtic music. This DVD picks up where the other one left off.
Orla does a wonderful version of Cerricfergus, which is also on her first solo effort. Cerrickfergus reminds me of The water is wide, which also appears on her first solo CD.
Orla plays the harp very well and to me has the best Celtic accent of the bunch.
Meav does a version of Dulaman, which to me is possibly the finest song on the DVD/CD. Dulaman reminds me of Si Do Mhaimeo i. Meav also does the Last Rose of Summer with Chloe. This song is subpeb. Meav is well known throughout the Celtic world and it's no wonder why.
Meav's voice is in top form. When Meav sings she seems to flirt with the audience in a very playful manner.
Lisa does Caledonia and The Voice which are also outstanding performances and are well worth the listen. My Blessing is another song that she does and it is nothing short of superb. Lisa remains my favorite vocalist of the bunch.
Mairead to me again steals the show. She does a poignant version of Shendoah and then leads into a very lively version of Pacific Slope. She also does a wonderful version of Garnuaile's Dance. Mairead like the first concert is a ball of fire and a delight to watch. Mairead has to be seen to be believed. She is a show within a show.
The biggest problem with me is the additon of Hayley Westenra. Hayley who does have a nice voice, in my opinion adds very little to the group. My biggest problem is her version of Scarborough Fair. Scarbrough Fair of course is a traditional song. The original version had around ten versus.
Hayley only sings the same three verses that Simon and Garfunkel used on their version, infact she only does two of the verses. For me this is a real disappointment. I was hoping for a more traditional arrangement, instead of a remake of a popular song.
Another problem for me is the version of Somewhere over the Rainbow.
Even though the song is sung in A capella and has good harmony, it seems out of place to me. At this point the concert loses its Celtic charm and becomes Hollywood for one song. There are also remakes of songs from the previoius Celtic Woman CD such as Orrinoco Flow and Your Raise me Up. As much as I like the songs I really don't think they  need to be repeated on this performance. I know they are very popular and were sung on the performance. These young women are possibly the most talented singers in the world. It at least would be very hard to argue that.
This overall is an outstanding performance. It is at least as good, if not better than the first. At a time when great music is very hard to find, this is a real gem. Sit back take a deep breath and relax.",1170374400,7,2674,4.31610337972167
2704713,5,B000LC4CVA,Pure class and beautiful music (and women). Feeds my distant Scot-Irish roots. Love it. Will watch many times in the future.,1170374400,7,124,4.9523809523809526
2704714,4,B000LC4CVA,"Slane Castle is the perfect backdrop for the second Celtic Woman concert on DVD.  The castle is all lit up and the Celtic WomEn are in top form.  This was the first appearance of Hayley Westenra as the newest member of CW.  I have to admit when I heard she was joining the group, my first thought was ""if it's not broke, why fix it?""  I will tell you now, happily, I was wrong.  I really enjoyed listening to her sing and thought she made a nice addition to this group of extraordinarily gifted women.

The music is as wonderful as I had expected and I watched the DVD twice today.  I had the opportunity to see Celtic Woman in concert this summer.  There were several songs that they performed that night that I had never heard them sing.  I remember thinking, I hope they are going to record these.  They did.

The one song I really wanted them to record was ""At the Ceili"" a fun little song about women going to a Ceili (party) and seeking out men.  It is upbeat and impossible not to want to clap along or tap your foot.  Meav, Lisa and Orla sing that song and they really look like they are having a good time doing it.

Another favorite was the ""Pacific Slope.""  Mairead is playing her fiddle, with the accompaniment of two dueling bodhran players.  I love when they do that.  The audience is clapping along, while Mairead is dancing around barefooted.  She is quite the performer.

I really expected to hate the song sing out, because other reviewers talked about how cheesy it was.  I didn't hate it.  It's a little chipper, but it didn't make me want to hit the skip button or anything.

This is a wonderful DVD and Slane Castle is a beautiful backdrop.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the repeat of songs from the previous DVD and CD.  They once again performed Orinoco Flow, Danny Boy, Somewhere and You Raise Me Up.  While I love those songs, I was sorry to see them appear again.  The arrangement and everything remained the same.  I would have preferred four new songs.",1170288000,79,1986,4.355191256830601

Their voices are beautiful.....favorites are Lisa,Chloe & Hayley. The last song, ""You Raise Me Up"" brought tears to my eyes. First time I saw Celtic Woman was on a PBS special in '05. They are touring the USA again. My boyfriend got tickets for their Tampa concert. We are really looking forward to a wonderful evening.",1170288000,7,434,4.576923076923077
2704716,5,B000LC4CVA,"Celtic Woman - A New Journey: Live at Slane Castle, Ireland(2007)  is an excellent piece of musical videography.  The girls which include Hayley Westenra, a powerful signer in her own light, all perform a masterfull piece of production put together by the team of video director Declan Lowney, and orchestra director David Downes.  The DVD is excellent.  The girls are talents in their own rights including the high-spirited fiddle playing of Mairead.  The set that surrounds the historic Slane Castle is wonderfully put together, that binds the background of the castle, orchestra and group together.  The Celtic Woman group is a must see if they are coming to your area on their upcoming tour.",1170288000,4,695,5.052631578947368

I have ordered another copy just in case the original gets damaged.,1170201600,3,355,4.159420289855072

It has a mix of everything you could call Celtic with an awesome rendition on the ""Irish Fiddle"" or violin to a mixture of beautiful songs from each of the artists. The CD's are available from each of the artists and I would recommend them also. Don't miss this one when it becomes available.",1169078400,13,426,4.083333333333333

Appearing with the four talented Irish singers, and incredible fiddle player, is a young woman from New Zealand named Hayley Westernra.  IMHO, she brings the production its fifth star.  Her voice is incredibly clear and hauntingly beautiful.  I'm sure they'll sell more copies because of her.

I was immediately captured by the celtic music and the beautiful voices of all of the women in the production.  I think that the Celtic Woman show has been one of the best kept secrets in the music world.  I immediately ordered four of their CD's and DVD's.  The addition of Haley to the program has really improved the show in my opinion.  By the time the show was over, I was in love with all of the women in the production.  If you like angelic voices, unbelievable harmony, and a wonderful variety of traditional and classical songs, you will absolutely love their DVD.",1167350400,39,710,4.333333333333333
2704735,5,B000LC4CVA,"First of all I'd just like to say, that critics are really a pain in the butt. It's unbelievable how this group has been called the ""New Stepford Wives"", and their sound is ""nausiatingly pretty."" As a musician you are always taught that your proficiency must be like the instrument itself. You must become so much a part of the instrument that you can produce music as though that instrument were alive and doing it all by itself. Here you have an example of pinpoint note efficiency and all the performance points that go with singing and performing being done at the top of the game. But I guess in an America where mediocrity is king, it's not a good thing to be professional. I suppose Michael Jordan was just too good on the court. Joe Montana shouldn't have been such a winner. Celtic Woman needs to be more average and raw so the critics will like them.
Anyone who wants to see how music is to be performed and sung needs to grab a copy of this video or the CD. There's enough mediocrity out there,  haven't we had enough of it?",1167264000,13,1035,4.362694300518135

Everyone should juts listen and see just how amazing this outstanding group of woman are!!  They need to get a real taste for themselves!!

This is just the opposite of Riverdance, the first edition was by far the best.  This edition is so MUCH BETTER than the first one, that it's almost like watching a totally different group of womyn.
