8182076,5,B000NVRONC,"This is fantastic! If you want a break down of WHY Chinese medicine works the way it does and WHY it is divided into five seasons, this is for you. It will walk you through how your body works and how you can restore it to full functioning naturally. It's a wealth of information that anyone can use. The instruction is clear (the English is accented, but there are subtitles), logical and easy to follow. Great stuff.",1422835200,2,418,4.441558441558442
8182077,5,B000NVRONC,"Each of the dvds in the 18 hour, 6-dvd collection ""Understanding Qigong"" is another masterpiece by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming!  The purpose of this work is to help the student understand Qigong, and each dvd effectively addresses a key aspect of the subject ""Qigong"" in a way that is truly educational and valuable for the student's understanding and development.  All of the information provided in each dvd is so important in developing a foundation upon which to build all future future Chi development and/or Martial Arts training. I would highly recommend that the interested student purchase the entire 6-dvd set for their own benefit.  The student will also find that these works are referenced as the source of ""further in-depth information"" in other of Dr. Yang's amazing works.  As in all areas of life, an effective and powerful end product requires an effective and powerful foundation upon which the end product is built.  This work by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming offers the student that foundation.",1418947200,,999,5.104294478527607

8182079,5,B000NVRONC,"There are no other sources like those from Dr. Yang.
I teach Qigong and Taiji and I have many of Dr. Yangs books which I recommend highly. The books are often a little difficult to read but in these DVDs everything is clear, organized and sequential. Start with DVD 1 & 2 when you want more just keep going! Dr. Yang has so much knowledge it is quite amazing.

When I started reading his books about 12 years ago I found him a little hard to get into. After watching 7 or 8 DVDs I find him kind of charming, in other words, he grows on you. After watching so much of his stuff, I feel like I actually know him as one of my teachers, even though I have never met him. All of his DVDs are like attending a personal workshop/seminar, and you can watch them over and over!

The truth is, he knows this stuff inside and out, from scientific to spiritual. Another truism is this... No one else will give you as much information, period.",1358640000,3,930,4.189944134078212

8182082,5,B000NVRONC,"Understanding Qigong DVD4 is the latest and most bountiful DVD of the Understanding Qigong series.  Master Yang's understanding of Qigong has grown exponentially over the years, evident in the fruits of his labors, DVDs, videos and books that he has shared with his students and readers.  Fortunately, along with his growth in knowledge is equally strong growth in passing along the knowledge in ways that the average student can assimilate and find useful in their lives.  I've always believed that true teaching involves being able to bring the student to an understanding of the process involved, as opposed to being able to merely recite the correct answer.

Over the years Master Yang's ability to pass on an understanding of the ""key"" to the knowledge being presented, has grown along with his own understanding.  Many people claim to extensively study or practice the particular art or skill that they profess to embrace.  Yet when you see the fruits of their efforts, they are not healthy or bountiful.

Master Yang cites the numerous ancient texts that he has studied in his quest for mastery. When his teaching products are reviewed, it becomes obvious that he can ""walk the talk"".

He is able to link the ancient Eastern knowledge with equally valuable modern Western knowledge.  Master Yang is truly a dynamic and committed teacher.  His dedication to the sharing of correct knowledge is something I am so thankful for.

One basic theme of this DVD is ""Use it or lose it"".  Just as stagnant water is not healthy, the body also needs to have movement to keep itself healthy.  Due to today's modern society the majority of people have lost their daily contact with nature and live in an artificially designed world.  Master Yang explains how in the past roads were not flat and smooth, but were hilly with rough and bumpy sections.  Walking on this uneven surface helped the ligaments, tendons and connective tissue to stay strong and flexible.

The roads that many people use today for jogging and exercising are perfectly smooth and flat, consequently resulting in only a small part of the connective tissue being used and strengthened.  In a similar vein, I've always believed that people that work out with free weights are stronger than those who use weight lifting machines.  In free weights, the person has to balance the weight from side to side and forward to back, as well as lifting the weight vertically.  With a weight lifting machine, it balances the weight for you, resulting in less of a workout for the connective tissue.

Over the years I've found that persons who lift free weights have more ability to neutralize a Qin Na move on their wrist than those who use machines for weight lifting.  This is due to the strengthening of the connective tissue and muscles when having to balance the weight as well as lift it.

Master Yang provides very powerful arguments for linking lack of movement to modern day medical problems, such as cancer.  Someone very close to me who was not exercising had reached the point where she could not lift her arms above her head.  Within a year or two she developed breast cancer.  Master Yang talks about how important it is for women to learn upper body exercises to heal the body and prevent cancer from developing in the first place.  Men are advised to use their legs properly in order to help prevent colon cancer.  Corresponding exercises are demonstrated and explained for the various yin organs of the body.

The exercises on the DVD are excellent.  Even if they were just demonstrated, with no explanation, it would be a wonderful collection of valuable, effective and useful exercises.  But Master Yang goes much further than just a demo tape, he provides extensive and thorough explanations of the various movements and their specific health benefits for the various yin organs.  This is not someone just mimicking the movements and putting out a video, but rather a master who is taking the time and energy to properly and fully present the material.  Master Yang's growing understanding of these concepts is so very much in evidence while watching this DVD.

Master Yang tells a personal story about his mother experiencing the beginning stages of Alzheimer's Disease and how she began to lose her memory.  After not seeing her for a few years, he was surprised to discover that she was no longer having problems with her memory.  His mother told him that when she realized she was beginning to have memory problems, she would make a practice every day of trying to memorize phone numbers of all their friends and relatives.  From using her brain every day in such a manner, it became more active, more electricity (Qi) was reaching the brain, and her memory became healthy again.  When you use your muscles or your brain, you make electricity and oxygen move in your body.  This leads to a healthy organism and helps prevent problems from arising as you grow older.

 Master Yang provides information about the role of fascia, which being a poor conductor, separates and shields different parts of the body which operate at different energy levels and different functions.  Fascia surrounds the diaphragm, which is a good conductor, expanding and contracting constantly second by second throughout the day and night.  Master Yang points out that a good conductor sandwiched between poor conductors satisfies the definition of a battery.  This is the middle dan tien.

In the upper half of the body are found the lungs and the heart, surrounding the heart is a sac, which is referred to in Chinese Medicine as the pericardium.  The Chinese doctors believe that the pericardium is so important that it is not part of the heart, but rather a separate organ.

Master Yang explains that the heart is like an engine, and the pericardium is like the cooling system.

I like the fact that master Yang does not denigrate the Western modern science alternative, but rather, showing that it is a part of the whole, it can be used to further our understanding of how the channels in the body work, or to better see the structure of the meridians and the vessels.  Master Yang states that the Chinese theories on energy are two thousand years old, and he believes that modern technology can enhance this ancient knowledge.

Even if you are experienced in Qigong, or a beginner, start with DVD1 of the series and watch them in order.  And then, most importantly as Master Yang points out, ""just do it"".  A wonderful series on Qigong and a necessity for anyone studying internal martial arts/external martial arts or body energy work, such as Qigong.
