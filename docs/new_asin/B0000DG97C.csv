8000981,1,B0000DG97C,"Hard to believe how any company could botch a World Cup Finals soccer highlight package, but this one does. The DVD is incredibly clunky to scroll through as the on-screen menu is like some Buckminster Fuller incomplete geodesic dome. Do I press the ""up"" arrow or the ""right"" arrow to scroll to the next header?
Very annoying.

The actual highlights on the copy I had just jumped from 1978's group that had Argentina in it straight to the second rd. Maybe it's the copy I had but what of the other groups?

Then there is this function that allows you to pick a team and thinking it'd show all that team's WC game highlights when I picked ""Holland"" and all I got was the 1978 Final.

Plus this select-a-country feature only included eight nations over the three World Cups.

The extras are laughably bad. The ""Game"" asks you to choose one keeper, defender, midfielder and forward to guess what their dream team was. Boring!

The ""Quizz"" (yes, spelled incorrectly with that extra ""z"") has the exact same ten questions every single time you go to it.

The ""Bonus"" has the Best Goals with no play-by-play so, unless you are like me and can recall these players, you'll have no idea who scored the beat goals featured. It also features only three goals from 1978 and Scotland's Archie Gemmill's slalom through the Dutch D is not one of them.

The Stats has something called ""attacks"" of which Argentina and Holland both had ""15 attacks"" in the 1978 WC Finals.

The ""Surprise"" is about the only good thing as it has Maradona doing some amazing ""keepy-uppy"" juggling with a tennis ball.

Be assured this is not the official FIFA World Cup films but just some hackneyed version wacked together and put out with little rhyme or reason.",1238976000,,1726,4.632786885245902

The quality of the production is poor but I give it 3 stars because of the content. The narration isn't that great either, he keeps repeating the same phrases.",1116288000,7,314,4.7272727272727275
