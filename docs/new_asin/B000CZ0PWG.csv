8102312,2,B000CZ0PWG,"I hoped this film was a cogent examination of redemption. It turned out to be a recitation of every bad trait ever demonstrated by French males. Egotistical, self-centered, self absorbed braying asses are shown at their worst! How did this thing ever get past the editing crew is beyond me! Surely a turkey looks like a turkey...even in the editing room! Rent a Betty Boop retrospective!",1358121600,,387,4.878787878787879
