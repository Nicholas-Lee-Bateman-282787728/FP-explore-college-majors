6398455,4,B00K1G4RMA,Jack Kelly carried the show himself and did a good job. It don't know why james Garner left the show after year three. He is most identified with the series.,1404604800,2,157,4.266666666666667

6398457,5,B00K1G4RMA,"5 STAR QUALITY FOR PICTURE AND SOUND, ANY MAVERICK FAN WILL WANT THE FINAL SEASON.
I NOW HAVE ALL THE SEASONS AND I CANNOT FAULT ANY OF THEM APART FROM THE PRICE OF NUMBER 3 WHICH I EVENTUALLY PURCHASED FROM AMAZON MARKET PLACE. I AM NOW COLLECTING SUGARFOOT AND CANT WAIT FOR SEASON 3 TO COME OUT. I AM HOPING SOON THAT BRONCO AND LAWMAN WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON.",1402876800,6,362,4.260869565217392
6398458,4,B00K1G4RMA,"At last Jack Kelly ( the longest serving Maverick ) gets the DVD cover to himself. As a child I always loved James Garner and still do. However as an Adult I can see that I underrated Kelly. I now regard him as highly as I do Garner. Many will disagree and Garner will always be remembered as the star. Kelly given a good script handles the dialogue beautifully and his facial expressions when cornered are a delight. Season 5 is Maverick finally winding down as Warner Bros lose their grip on the western genre. Despite that one can still find much to enjoy in these episodes and with the bonus of Peter Breck as Doc Holliday as well. I am glad to complete my collection and thus far have never had a problem with any of the pressed DVD-R sets I own ( and I own almost all the WB sets). So for the fans of Maverick then buy, enjoy, savour.",1399852800,45,840,4.191358024691358
6398459,5,B00K1G4RMA,"Amazon Prime's videos of this series are the BEST DEAL, especially for those that need closed captions! Season Five's episodes are FUN as are the second half of Season Four. They regain the quality of the first and second seasons. Jack Kelly's performances are excellent and the scripts are extremely well written. Several episodes rank with the best of the five seasons of which I own on both DVD and Amazon Prime. The Prime advantages besides closed captions are that they can be downloaded for play later when no Internet is available and viewable on portable media players. I use both an iPad and iPhone with downloaded episodes for times when no internet is available! I am currently chuckling about the LAST EPISODE of this last season!",1479513600,3,742,4.850393700787402

6398463,5,B00K1G4RMA,"James Muirden's book reflects old school astronomy. Part I deals exclusively with equipment: telescopes, binoculars and observatories. Part II is about the solar system. Part III is about the stars. So much has changed since Muirden's book was first published. Astronomers now accept that the moon was created when a small planet crashed into the earth while the solar system was young. The earth absorbed the smaller planet and reformed while a portion of Earth's crust was thrown into space to coalesce as the moon. Furthermore, it is now accepted that all the craters on the moon were caused by the impacts of meteors, asteroids and comets. Impacts are the rage. It was once thought the dinosaurs died off due to slow changes in the earth's environment. The new astronomy says the dinosaurs died quickly as the result of a collision with an asteroid. Muirden's book is most relevant in its discussion of total lunar eclipses, and I will refer to it prior to the Great American Eclipse of August 21, 2017. Muirden treats the photosphere, chromosphere and corona in ways that have stood the test of time.",1464134400,,1105,4.882978723404255

6398479,4,B00K1G4RMA,This DVD completes my Maverick TV series.  The story lines or plot were quite good but it didn't have the same gusto to it as the first three seasons did.  James Garner left quite a big hole when he departed from the series.  I recommend this DVD for the avid collector to add to their library.  Warner Bros. knew how to keep the viewers interest in following their TV series no matter how long or short each series ran.,1424304000,,420,4.2784810126582276

6398481,4,B00K1G4RMA,"Some good stories, but Garner was the best Maverick!  Jack Kelly's Maverick was stiffer and not as clever, so the stories tend to follow 2 or 3 plots over and over.  Robert  Colbert's Maverick was childishly naive and totally unbelievable as a member of the family,  OK for those who want to collect the complete run.",1421107200,,317,4.607142857142857

6398490,3,B00K1G4RMA,"When originally aired, the fifth and final season of Maverick consisted of 13 new episodes starring Jack Kelly interspersed with repeats of selected episodes from seasons one and two starring James Garner. The fifth season DVD therefore contains only the 13 new Kelly episodes, making it rather expensive compared to seasons 1-4. The episodes are in English only, with no subtitles, and no extras. While the episodes are enjoyable, none are particularly outstanding. I would therefore recommend this DVD only to fans of the series who already have the first four seasons and want to complete the collection. Fifth season guest stars include Jack Cassidy, Reginald Owen, Peter Breck, Jim Backus, Richard Loo, Marie Windsor, John Dehner, Andrew Duggan, Sig Ruman, Mickey Shaughnessy, Robert Wilke, Ed Nelson, and Charles Lane.",1412467200,12,824,5.346153846153846
6398491,4,B00K1G4RMA,"Maverick WAS James Garner. After he left, it was never quite the same. But Jake Kelly as brother Bart carried on the series well after Garner left. Not as good as the episodes with James Garner, but still good and recommended.
