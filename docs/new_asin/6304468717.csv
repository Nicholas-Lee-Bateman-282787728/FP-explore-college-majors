7872387,5,6304468717,"This is an awe-inspiring (VHS) show from NOVA.  Among other things, it explains how the bear's system functions during so-called hibernation.  That biochemical process stuns and humbles me.  The mother bear can still birth and feed the newborns while still in the cave.  Although not a recent show, it still has much to offer.  This NOVA show is not at all dry; it is well-produced and informative.  Why is it that animals keep getting smarter, the more I learn, as I get older?  I will be curious about what global warming does to the black bear's natural life processes.",1381363200,,572,4.717171717171717
