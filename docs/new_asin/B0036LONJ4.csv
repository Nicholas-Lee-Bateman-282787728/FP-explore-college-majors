8434586,4,B0036LONJ4,"I was looking for a cardio DVD that gave me a good workout but didn't require weights or a lot of jumping for days when my muscles and joints needed a break.  This DVD fits the bill; the complete workout is about 60 minutes long and does a good job of keeping my attention by mixing up moves and intensity.  It's not exceptionally challenging but does keep my heartrate up and doesn't have the problem I see with a lot of DVDs where the instructors make you pause for lengthy explanations of the combos.  There are three instructors:  Tracey, Joseff, and Jerico, who rotate throughout the video to guide you.  The moves were basic, well-mixed (with upper and lower body) and easy to follow; all in all a good routine if you're looking to have fun and sweat a lot but not get your heart blasting out of your chest.  There are options suggested for taking it easy or amping it up with plyometrics.
It also allows you to chose from premixes of 20, 30, or 40 minutes for days when you're short on time, and there is a bonus abs/upper body section.",1320451200,,1043,4.3782383419689115
8434587,2,B0036LONJ4,I work out about six times a week and am an advanced exerciser.  This workout barely got my heart rate up more than for a few minutes here and there.  It was not very fun or intersting. It was one of my least favorite of the many videos I've done.,1307404800,,247,3.92
8434588,5,B0036LONJ4,"I would not recommend this for beginners or those with no kickboxing experience. This is a very cardio intensive workout, if you're looking for intensity than this is the workout for you. Tracey,Josef and Jericho, all co-lead. Jericho and Josef, really shine in this workout, Jericho is strong, beautiful and had some very cool creative moves, while Josef is  precise and really knows his stuff. The cuing is fair,the music is really good and on beat. For most people this workout will get your heart rate up till the very end. Lots of plyometrics and kickboxing drills. If you don't want to jump stay with level 1 and still get a tough workout without ever leaving the ground. Up for the ""Challenge"" and want to jump than go for level 2 it's up to you. The only negative I have is there is NO cool down just stretching, so you'll have to do that on your own, that been said this is a really good kickboxing workout with zero dread factor that will have you smiling and wanting to do it over and over again",1269561600,3,1006,4.437837837837838
