8290063,3,B001CU7OH4,"This work stated that there are 35,000 taxidermists in the US.  The work is not entirely gushy; it acknowledges that some, especially women, find the practice barbaric.  However, it says others deem it art.
It tries to provide a history to the practice.  It speaks of tanning and leather.  I wonder if they just stole from their leather episode and therefore cut costs.  But then it points to the Ancient Egyptians who mummified pets.  Well, I wouldn't say that's similar as the pets were wrapped up; their skins weren't on display.
The work speaks of the evolution of materials.  This episode was so important to me because I never knew that most stuffed animals are the animal's head but a false torso.  The older works are made of wood, but now taxidermists can use plexiglass.  It says many used arsenic on smaller animals, and sometimes died working with that material.  This reminded me of mercury and the phrase ""mad as a hatter.""  (This also reminded me of the Curies who worked with radium, or something like that, and then died of it.  Well, that's what Lisa Simpson said!)
Some of the interviewees are characters.  The first main interviewee has a thick Brooklyn accent, or something like that.  He sounded more like Rocky Balboa or Danny DeVito's character on ""Taxi"" than some expert.  Later, the German physician who created the Body Works museum exhibit is interviewed.  He looks boney like actor Peter Weller and his accent may remind some of Mike Myers' Dieter.
The work said as species die out, more hunters are taking photos of animals and then having taxidermists make replicas with no real body parts.  I love the green aspirations of that, but then why not just buy a fake and not go hunting?
As mentioned before, the Body Works exhibit comes up.  I like how this suggests that the next subjects of taxidermists will be humans ourselves.  However, these objects focused on muscles and venal systems.  They weren't just human bodies displayed like bear rugs are.  It's not quite the same thing, but I love where the took the message.
In a way, I think the program allows viewers to come to their own conclusions about the practice.  This didn't make me want to go hunting or to outlaw the field.",1332720000,,2215,4.713541666666667
