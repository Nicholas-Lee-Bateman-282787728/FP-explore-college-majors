8415507,5,B0043YXFK6,These dvds were bought for a Christmas gift for my mother and she loved them. The only problem she found in them is the one of the seasons she said the last 2 discs in it were backwards. Basically disc 4 was marked with disc 5 label and disc 5 was marked with disc 4 label. She figured it out pretty quick and now when she watches them she knows to watch them in the right order. But other that they were great and She loves them totally and can't wait for seasons 7 and 8 now. Great Deal.,1327622400,,489,3.9494949494949494
8415508,2,B0043YXFK6,"The shipping on this product was fast. I was glad that I didn't have to wait that long. However, when I opened the package there wasn't anything keeping the DVDs from moving around during transit and when I started to inspect the DVDs, two of the cases were broken and four different discs were scratched. The breaks and scratches are minor and the DVDs still work as far as I can tell, but when something is advertised as brand new I expect there to not be any flaws with the product once I get it. Point and case, I won't be buying from this seller again.",1304294400,7,557,4.264150943396227
