4240461,1,B0040J1RZE,This was the lamest christmas DVD I have seen in a really long time. I don't know why Dean Cain was on the front of the DVD he only had about 8 lines in the whole movie and his character never really made sense. They had too many story lines going on that none of them made any sense. Do not waste your time or money on this DVD this year!,1291593600,4,339,3.788732394366197
4240462,3,B0040J1RZE,"I initially decided to watch this movie because I saw that Dean Cain (who I am a fan of from his days as Clark Kent/Superman from Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, but once I saw the film I realized he had a very small role in the film. I saw quite a bit of trailers prior to the film airing on TV and each trailer only mentioned Dean Cain. I am also a fan of Emmanuelle Vaugier so I decided to watch anyway, but the promotion of this film left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. As for the film itself, I guess it was okay, but I found myself bored throughout it. I don't think the story was engaging enough for me to truly enjoy the story. I also felt like some of the issues in the film were kind of contrived and this is coming from a person that enjoys most Christmas films.",1291593600,14,790,3.9130434782608696
4240463,4,B0040J1RZE,"I don't know about anyone else, but there are times through out the year (Thanksgiving, Christmas etc.)where I want to watch a good cheesy movie. I thought it was cute though some scenes were a little over the top, but over all I liked it.",1291161600,2,239,4.333333333333333

The acting terrible.
The scenes clumsy.

4240466,4,B0040J1RZE,"I bought this because it was new on Amazon and we wanted a couple of new Christmas movies this year.  The format of this is like a made-for-TV movie--88 minutes running time.  This is very cute and tame, but I would rate it PG only because little kids might not enjoy it like they would a Toy Story or other kid's movie.  Good for 8 years old and up, I'd say.  Some small incongruencies in the story line that are not too noticeable unless you are very critical.

Cute story about a young woman who goes for a job interview as an advertising executive, and she ends up being hired as a nanny instead.  Fun, predictable, just a nice movie to watch when little eyes and ears are around.  No profanity, no nudity, no politics, just a simple Christmas romantic comedy.  Fun movie for a slumber party for young preteens and teens.  Good backup movie to show during family gatherings to avoid fights because most people have never seen it before.",1290988800,49,940,4.450292397660819
4240467,2,B0040J1RZE,"I was curious to watch it since I find this actress extremely attractive and having Dean Cain there as well. I expected it to involve more holiday romance but was disappointed. First of all I thought she was going to romance Dean Cain but the characters were all screwed up. At least the end was good but I still regret having downloaded it. People, wait till it comes out streaming on Netflix don't buy it.",1290988800,,407,4.44

If you think the male actor Dean Cain shown on the cover us the romantic lead in this movie , think again!!! He's not!!! And there is zero chemistry - none at all !!!- between the couple in this movie. Oh how it dragged on, oh how it bored me and oh how I feel duped.  Is this an advertising ploy??

4240531,4,B0040J1RZE,"Ally Leeds is an ad executive who loses her job in mid-pitch to a new client for something that is not at all her fault.  She needs a job to pay the mortgage or she'll have to return to Ohio -- a fate colder than California.  With hope all around her she interviews with another ad agency, one of the best, and winds up getting a position as a nanny.

  It took me several viewings to begin to appreciate this movie.  It is not the greatest Christmas movie I've ever seen; it doesn't have dialogue that will make Shakespeare fans sit up and take notice, and it has another ad executive in it.  I was beginning to think there was a sale on ad exec positions in movies -- ""Eve's Christmas"", ""Angel in the Family"", and ""Single Santa Seeks Mrs. Claus"" all have ad execs in them but in this case it's a necessary thing.  The plot revolves around Ally's job.

  It is a pleasant hour and a half's worth of entertainment.  I liked the music -- lots of it and, if you like popular music, you'll probably find a few songs you like.  Some of the plot was not the most believable -- do they really fire ad executives just for losing one account?  And the dialogue was nothing special, but it wasn't that bad.  And there were some nice scenes and just a few pleasant surprises here and there.

  In short, it is a very nice film, if not a great one; something that you can enjoy watching with the kids.",1420243200,,1390,4.220532319391635

The first time I will admit I was a bit distracted, because I was cooking while watching on our kitchen tv. So about half way through I turned it off. The second time I put it on, I started from the beginning.. esp since I had paid money to watch it instantly. Yet i couldn't get through it again. The acting was so stiff and fake feeling.. and the story line just didn't capture my attention. It was painful to watch.  I didn't get to the end.

It was sweet seeing her go from ad exec to nanny and how it played out.  I am not sure how realistic the storyline is though, since she's going from a great job to a nanny job.  I guess it could happen, right?

4240598,5,B0040J1RZE,Ive read many reviws by people who are disapointed that Dean Cain has such a small role in this movie. While I have to  agree with that I have never been a fan of his outside of this movie. Not to get negatitive here but the whole superman thing has been done to death. Anyway we all have an actor or actress we don't care for but there seems to be an exception to the rule. That having been said lets get to the movie. One reveiever was upset that the nanny let the kids eat junk food have fun and undermined the mom aka her boss. I read this after I ordered the movie. Then I watched it once it arrived and the first thing I thought is I would have done the same thing. The mom had the kids eating healthy which I conceed is a good thing but not all the time. They were also on a schedule to the point of being robots and weren't having fun. The one time they did have fun it was at the nannys expense. Now I don't consider pancakes junk food as a general rule but after youd been eating what they had I guess they would be. One thing I forgot to mention is that after several years of having them the parents had stopped having Christmas parties and the kids wanted to have one again. In the end they got what they wanted. So did everybody else including the nanny who almost lost her boyfriend because of a white lie. Merry Christmas,1322611200,,1337,4.0643939393939394

4240601,1,B0040J1RZE,"I love Christmas movies and have a rather large collection.  This movie, however, did not make it into my collection.  I was disappointed in its message.  The Nanny undermined the mother of the kids she was watching.  I believe the mother should have been more fun and loving.  I truly do, but I do not think that the Nanny should have let the kids eat junk food and participate in activities that the mother was against.  In the end, the mother changed her ways and was feeding her kids what she had considered junk food earlier.  The Nanny ended up with everything she wanted.  The mother became more fun like the Nanny.  Great.  Alls well that ends well - except that it left me not liking the Nanny for undermining her boss.  Also, I like Dean Cain, but the cover is misleading.  Cain plays a very, very small role in this film.",1312675200,6,832,4.401315789473684

movies with Dean Cain. However, he didn't really have
a major part in the movie as was lead to believe. The

overall the movie just wasn't that great.",1292803200,2,320,4.35

4240607,4,B0040J1RZE,"Dean Cain has become quite a christmas movie fixture.  His double DVD presence this year is welcome and Nanny For Christmas is charming.

Executive Samantha needs a nanny, and up and coming professional Ally(Emmanuelle Vaugier) is job hunting.  Becoming a nanny turns her life around with Dean Cain entering the picture and while the film is marginally predictable, it is enjoyable.  Romance flourishes and this family friendly film comes recommended.

Why watch the Grinch, or Santa Claus this year...Saddle up a new DVD and look for Nanny for Christmas.

Keep them coming Anchor Bay, we need more like this.",1291766400,24,609,5.101010101010101
