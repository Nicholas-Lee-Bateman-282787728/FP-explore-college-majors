1829833,5,B000087EZF,"I like Adrian Paul in this and Highlander and enjoyed watching the TV series, thats why I bought this.  I don't think it's in this but, Inever saw the final episode of Alien Tracker.",1360800000,,182,4.352941176470588
1829834,5,B000087EZF,"MOVIE CAME REALLY FAST. WILL ORDER AGAIN FROM THIS PERSON. THE MOVIE AND COVER  WAS NEW AND
THANKS ALOT, SMOOCHES.",1359244800,,114,4.7
1829835,5,B000087EZF,Well worth watching.  Good adventure film with lots of action.  Grab some popcorn and settle in for a good time.,1354406400,,112,4.55
1829836,1,B000087EZF,When I was doing a search I asked for the series Tracker. The year it was on I loved it. I thought I was getting the 8 or 10 episodes that was on Sci Fi. What a waste of money. If you hadn't seen the seies you wouldn't have a clue what that dvd was even about. I haven't seen any of these repeats on Sci Fi or I would record them myself. I will definitely be more careful in the future as to what I am getting.,1306454400,7,410,3.6704545454545454
1829837,5,B000087EZF,"thanks for sending so quick, its a good cinema film, I like it very much.",1252713600,,73,3.933333333333333
1829838,1,B000087EZF,"With  such immortal lines as ""Take my life force please"", this is without question one of the worst ""fims"" ever made. The acting is so terrible you initially think...""Oh No, this is one of those 1:00 a.m. softcore cable porn filcks."" Which is a perfect segway to explain the only legitimate reason to see this film, homo-erotic eye candy. Adrian Paul who for some unknown reason is found wandering the road looking like an underwear designer's wet dream, spends half of the movie half naked. Tied up on an ""exam"" table bound at the wrists and ankles, and wearing nothing but his skin-tight Calvins, our hero is ""ripe for the taking"", and wouldn't last a minute in the Castro. Surrounding him are guys in military uniforms, ready to ""turn up the heat."" At any second you expect that grinding  music to start and the evil military men ""have their way"" with our hapless and helpless alien. If eye candy is the objective, then it's worth the cheap price. If the viewer is looking for thought provoking science fiction, look somewhere else. And in the meantime, who knows there may be a sequel entitled ""Alien in the bunkhouse"", but until then this will have to do.",1125273600,12,1160,4.6536585365853655
1829839,2,B000087EZF,"When I ordered this I thought I was getting the pilot plus one or two other episodes from the TV series tracker, what I got was a poorly edited attempt to make a movie from the bare bones of three episodes (the pilot and two episodes from near the end of the series). In order to fit these three episodes into 143 minute running time they cut the episodes to the bare minimum, yet for some reason left in five minutes of flash backs that made perfect sense for tv episodes that are shown weeks apart but much less sense when we had seen scenes less than half an hour before. What really made me mad is the fact that they didn't include the last episode in the mix, so all you have is a poorly edited movie without a true ending. You would be better off recording the episodes off of the Sci-Fi channel while waiting for them to release the full season.",1048464000,94,852,4.201219512195122

7980018,2,B000087EZF,"as the last review have said this is a piss poor try at making a dvd the only reason why iam giving this any stars is the fact its a great show secondly at least someone made a dvd of this movie granted its horrible but your be surprise at how many other tv shows or movies that never had a dvd much less a vhs or blue-ray just look at Oliver & Company that took overly way to long to even come out on dvd the movie its self was in theater twice normally with a movie in theaters it would be release within a few months not this movie this is taken from wikipedia

Home media
Despite its financial success at the box office, the film was not released on home video despite being one of the most requested Disney ones.[23] After its theatrical re-release, it was released on VHS on September 25, 1996 for a limited time.[24] It was later released on DVD on May 14, 2002. A 20th Anniversary Edition DVD was released on February 3, 2009, and a 25th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray was released on August 6, 2013.

so as you can see this is why iam giving it 2 stars i do think alien tracker should be alot more cheaper for a new copy 3 or 4 bucks rather then 10 being the fact this is more like a movie rather then a tv show as it is suppose to be",1468281600,,1240,4.016194331983805
7980019,2,B000087EZF,Was a little disappointed.  Thought it was the whole syndicated series that lasted for a year.  Instead it was a 2 hour mish-mash of several episodes condensed into a movie version.  The result was an unfulfilling mess that didn't do the series credit.  The series was beginning to pick up speed just before it was cancelled; this showed none of the better efforts and little of the character bits that made the original shows fun.,1453939200,2,431,4.706666666666667

7980022,5,B000087EZF,"I rated this 5 stars because I bought it as a gift for someone who loved the show.  She's been wanting it for ages and when I found it, I got it for her birthday. Personally, I know nothing about but to her it's a 5 Star.  That's why I rated it that way.",1407024000,,254,3.685185185185185
7980023,3,B000087EZF,"If you like Adrian Paul, this may be worthwhile.  But this was originally a television series, and they very unskillfully cobbled together some of the action - so it is disjointed, redundant scenes, and not really well tied together.  Just a way to make a quick buck off the unwary consumer.  If the entire series were available, I'd buy it - but this was a waste of money - even to see Adrian Paul.",1396224000,4,399,4.364864864864865
