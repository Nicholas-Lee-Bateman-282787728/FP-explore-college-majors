1966429,5,B000127GFY,"I have the following WAVES: Virtual Vacations DVDs ...

- The Best Caribbean Beaches

- The Best Virgin Island Beaches

- Hawaiian Dreams

- The Best Florida Beaches

I just received my DVDs today and love them so much that I had to hurry to write a review.  The quality of the DVDs is BEAUTIFUL.  I feel like I'm almost there on the beach and listening to the ocean in person.  The DVDs are taking me back to my recent cruise where the first and last thing I heard each morning was the sound of the ocean.

These DVDs are going to be PERFECT when I'm relaxing and falling asleep or even just reading a book or walking on my treadmill.  They're an instant escape for your mind to a happy, tranquil place.

I hope everyone enjoys them as much as I am going to!

1966430,5,B000127GFY,"Highly recommend Caribbean Beaches!  I've never been to the Caribbean but feel as though I have after viewing this great DVD!  Images are crisp and clear, and the water looks so inviting and realistic -- if I get just a little closer to my TV screen,  perhaps I might even be able to feel the waves lapping at my toes.  RX for a stressful day:  pour yourself a Margarita, pop in the DVD, crank up the sound of the ocean waves, turn on your ceiling fan (for a cool simulated ocean breeze), and you're there!!!!!",1088985600,16,510,4.326315789473684
1966431,5,B000127GFY,"This dvd lives up to it's claim. The picture is sharper than the other ones were and the sound is crisper. This dvd features beautiful beaches and I do mean beautiful from the Caribbean,Bahamas and the Virgin Islands. The waves on all of these islands is lapping and in most of the footage you see full ocean views and waves washing on the shore and pulling way back. You also see some sunsets. Due to the sharper picture the waves look very blue and green and clear toward the shore. Also the breaks are a lot shorter and quicker than the Califoria and Hawaiia ones. Here's a more descriptive look at what I saw in these.
Day 1
Abaco
Shot 1
Full ocean view. You see the back of the ocean to the sand with lappers that wash upon the sand and then pull back.

The bonus features on this dvd are as follows:
Island and Day Selection
Preview trailers which consist of video clips of the Hawaiia and California ones as well as the Caribbean,Bahamas,Virgin Islands and the Florida One. The Florida one is very beautiful and breathtaking from the quick clip it shows.
Beach Subtitles Turn this on and it tells you were your at on each island.
Loop Play
When you watch this dvd it is like you have your own private beach on the caribbean. It is very relaxing and the future ones promise to bring more views. The Bahamas one will feature lighthouses. The Virgin Islands will feature diving pelicans. I can't wait to see that. Caribbean Daydreams will have 6 9 minute scenes and is loopable. Judging from the Florida trailer the Florida one will have some nice looking waves and white sand. And I love the new look of the coverart with the blue skies in the background. Also these are just with natural sounds with no music or narration. I also recommend the following wave vacation series dvds to go with these.
Vol 1
Hawaiian Dreams
Vol 2
Hawaiian Zen
Vol 3
Californian Dreams
Vol 4
Californian Zen
Vol 5
Inspiring Moments Best Of Califoria and Hawaiia waves with quotes
Vol 5c

Now available! The Best Bahama Beaches This features a thunderstorm over the ocean. This will be the first ocean wave video were you get to see an actual storm over the sea. It also features 2 lighthouses. Amazon should have this title shortly as it is already available from the publisher.

1966432,5,B000127GFY,"I really enjoyed this DVD. I just returned from a relaxing trip to the tropics and on my return was almost immediately confronted by all the stress that accompanies a normal life in the US. It was so nice to to have the new Carribean Beaches DVD from Waves.
I really like the realism of Waves the best. I travel a lot and Waves brings back all the great sights and sounds of my vacations, very relaxing. I hope they do a Thailand edition.",1070928000,5,438,4.226190476190476
1966433,5,B000127GFY,"This must be the next set of beaches in the series.  I have the California and Hawaii vidoes.  I find this product to be an improved version of ""Waves"". The dvd has many upgrades including a sharper picture and sound.  I like the quick transitions that seems to flow more and with less graphics.  It is no longer ment to be watched in 10 minute segments.  This new DVD flows through all of the segments quickly, easily, and effortlessly with a simple fade in and fade out between segments and without the graphics. ( six in all)
I alert others that this is not an IMAX film, rather it is a Digital Video and stereo sound.  I find the product to be an intimate time on the beach like a daydream with  the lapping of waves...its still beautiful and soothing like the entire series just a bit more mature.
I don't mind telling all of you, that as a relaxsation DVD, I can put all the stress of my life aside as I watch this spectacular view in all its' glorious color, refreshing sound, suspended beauty and natural surroundings.  I am so impressed with the quality and serenity of these beaches.  I have begun to save my dollars so I too can see this marvilous place for myself.
Thank you for putting me at rest anytime I find my life unravelling at the seems.  Your series again has helped me to cope the day to day axiety of working in a big city.

1966442,5,B000127GFY,"I used this when I was a stay at home mom. It was great to have something on in the background but none of the annoying noises and commercials of TV. Plus it kept my baby calm and happy. I was able to spend quality time feeding her and playing with her, without having my attention torn away by what's on TV. I'm one of those people who need something on (TV, radio) in the house to feel connected to the outside world.",1384128000,,419,4.0602409638554215
1966443,1,B000127GFY,"for the price of $20 it did not live up to my expectations.
The packaging broke as I was opening it.(that parts no big deal)
2. on the dvd it is blank, nothing written on it, nothing on either side??.
3. This DVD is NOT in HD. on my pc this dvd is very blur..
4. there was no sound? and my PC sound device is working with other dvd's.
you've got to realize that this dvd was produced in 2003 and the tech
was not as good as of today 2013.
I would return this and get my $ back, but it's not worth the time and trouble.
I'll just take the $20 loss on this one.

1966450,1,B000127GFY,"I made a huge mistake ordering this based on reviews.  It is very poor quality and doesn't look good on my 55"" HDTV.  It only fills a small portion of the huge screen.  Not what I was expecting at all.  If you don't have a HDTV then it might be okay but after experiencing true HD in Bluray this is a big disappointment.",1357689600,2,320,4.031746031746032

Why the breaks?  thats not in nature.  I do think the quality is good if you are just watching on a small screen.  Not sure about a big one.  It does not seem high quality.

1966455,5,B000127GFY,These virtual vacation dvds are really great.  They offer a variety of scenes and make you feel as if you are on a wonderful Caribbean vacation.  Of all the virtual ocean dvds out there these are some of the finest.  Really great photography and videos.  Buy it and go on a vacation in your home....very relaxating.,1323302400,,315,4.571428571428571
1966456,4,B000127GFY,beautiful secenery but a little long time spent on each scene! and waves mostly very slow and calm not much variaty.,1319155200,,116,4.571428571428571
1966457,3,B000127GFY,The Caribbean side of this tape is nice but repetitive and just sand and water over again.  The Hawaiian side of this same tape makes it worth buying because it is beautiful.,1314748800,,174,4.4375
1966458,3,B000127GFY,Beaches are beautiful but TV (not wide screen) format plus low resolution is poor. These beaches need to get a BluRay version newly done in wide screen.,1313280000,,152,4.666666666666667
1966459,5,B000127GFY,"I bought this dvd because I wanted to see ""moving pictures"" of beaches, not just magazine pictures.  I watched the dvd for the 1st time on a cold rainy night and I was transported right to the beach.  As the package stated I could almost feel the warm water lapping at my toes.  And I love the fact that there is no music or narration, only the sound of the water, birds and palm fronds. The dvd came with a bonus Hawaii disc.  I was a little disappointed in the Hawaii disc but the Caribbean disc more than makes up for it!  I'll definitely explore the other virtual vacations and I totally recommend this dvd to anyone who appreciates looking at gorgeous water.",1267574400,,663,4.357723577235772
1966460,1,B000127GFY,"I am very disappointed with this DVD. I bought it purely based on the high reviews that it was given. This was a big mistake. The picture quality is terrible. The picture is very grainy and not at all sharp. I have a very nice HD widescreen tv, so I was hoping for clear and sharp images. This is not at all what I got. Also, there are no options to choose from like other DVDs offer. The only thing I liked about this DVD was the sound of the waves. I watched it once, and I doubt I will ever view it again.",1230336000,10,508,3.894230769230769
1966461,4,B000127GFY,"The only reason I didn't give this a 5 is that it would be much better in high def and day six has some boring scenes involving staring at large rocks on a beach.  On my Mac, the scenes look great.  On my old TV, I would agree with some of the other viewers in that it is pretty much like watching somebody's vacation video, albeit a well done video.

It would be nice if it was broken into a morning, day and evening section instead of 6 short days.  Just when you get into relaxing into a beautiful sunset, it flips to bright day light.  This is a very minor point...just a nice to have.

It is incredibly relaxing and well done.  Most of the scenes are breath taking.  You almost feel like you're there.  I very much recommend it.",1230249600,7,733,4.141843971631205
1966462,5,B000127GFY,"Beautiful beautiful beaches.  So much so, that we've started researching the locations for upcoming vacations!

The soundtrack alone on the video is perfect as well.  Sometimes I just turn the sound on and leave the tv off just to hear the waves all day long while I'm working around the house.  Really sounds like you're living at the beach!  LOVE IT!

The video automatically shows various ocean/sands scenes for a few minutes each and then moves to the next scene (not really looping).  The sound quality is very good - sounds like the ocean - actually peaceful - not annoying.

It's not a bad video, but the quality isn't anything to write home about.  It's kind of like somebody's home video that's been put to DVD.  Not bad, but certainly nothing amazing.",1139875200,39,395,4.213333333333333

The beaches and waves are very relaxing and soothing.  I sat down and watched the whole thing on my widescreen TV as soon as I took the disc out of the media mailer.  The visuals were spectacular!  I only wish there was a function that splashed my feet whenever the waves lapped past the bottom of my TV screen!
