8457221,1,B00551WVK6,"One reason for the poor quality is that this isn't pressed from a master the way nearly all commercial DVDs are. It'se a DVD
 +r or DVD -r that's burned (the way you can burn them on your computer). Really fuzzy - even the titles are unreadable.",1438128000,,245,4.212765957446808

8457223,1,B00551WVK6,"This was obviously a VHS to DVD transfer, rather than a DVD being created from film.  Therefore the quality is very poor, unless you're watching on a 19in TV.  With modern large screen TVs the quality is unacceptable.",1417132800,,217,4.684210526315789
8457224,1,B00551WVK6,"Overall, I love the ""Carry On"" series but this has no business being part of the collection or even using the iconic title. Horrible script, terrible acting, amateur directing, and an atrocious attempt on capitalizing on the Emmanuelle theme.",1391644800,,242,5.230769230769231
8457225,1,B00551WVK6,The dvd is a terrible quality. it is fuzzy on the screen and is a very poor quality. We would return it but the cost of postage from Australia is not worth it. Amazon should consider not listing products from this seller with such poor quailty products. We are very disappointed,1361232000,2,278,4.470588235294118
8457226,4,B00551WVK6,"it was a very early carry movie, the start of the dvd was out of forus, my first thoughts was its a pirate copy, but i am guessing its just be copy from film to dvd, overall it wasn't too bad. very uper class speaking so couldn't follow it completely. but it still was well worth watching.",1349395200,,289,4.087719298245614
8457227,2,B00551WVK6,"I agree with Elais' two star review, not because of the technical quality of this print, which I haven't seen, but because of the inept quality of the film, itself.

The Carry On's were an extraordinarily inventive comic series, spanning twenty nine films over a twenty year period. Famous for their naughty (not dirty) humor, richly creative in the use of the double-entendre (A: My good man, you must be circumspect! B: Oh yes, sir. I was...when I was a baby!), they are true classics of British comic cinema. After the initial series of black and white comedies lampooning several British institutions, such as the national guard, hospitals, schools, police force, etc, with their gang of misfits creating havoc everywhere, their color series turned to lampooning film genres and history; many of these films are classic comedy in every sense of the word.

Though little known here in the US, they should be seen by every fan of film comedy. The target audience of the films was the 'blue collar' worker; certainly not the 'white collar' audience, who probably thought them beneath their dignity. But the 'average Joe' found them marvelously entertaining in Britain, and no doubt, our blue collar average Joe would, too. The complete collection is available fully restored on DVD, and well worth the modest price for a 30 disk collection; unfortunately, it's only in a British Region 2/PAL release, requiring a region-free/PAL compatible player (available here on Amazon, and elsewhere on the Net.)

But as with many series, the last few ran out of steam in creativity, and the creators' last gasp was a film lampooning the softcore porn film industry, which in the eyes of most all Carry On fans was a real loser of a film. While the films' stock-in-trade had always been naughty (again, not dirty) humor, this film was considered by most to be an exercise in bad taste.

So bad, in fact, that Barbara Windsor, who played the perennial bawdy party-girl character, refused to appear in the film. I'm still amazed that brilliant character comedienne Joan Sims was willing to have her name associated with it.

Perhaps a film about the wife of a French diplomat who, in order to secure her husband's job, decided to run around naked and seduce everything that moved could've been made funny. This one was purely tasteless. Though later titles in the series often paid more and more attention to the female anatomy for gags, the nearly fulltime naked antics of the central character in this film drew more head-shaking than laughs from viewers.

Though surprisingly not as humorless as the second to the last title, Carry On England, this one can also be easily ignored and viewers can finish their watching with Carry On Dick, the last of the truly great titles. A 'completist' may want to watch this one, but he, too, will likely be disappointed with this embarrassing waste of time.",1325376000,7,2885,4.889570552147239
