2678259,4,B000JMKKN6,"I rented this because it looked like a good old-fashioned romantic love story, and I love Christina Applegate. Also, Johnathan Schaech is pretty hot in the smoldering sense. It was completely romantic and chick-flicky, and I really liked it. It's all about letting go of the past and letting yourself heal to move on in life and love.

The whole movie has kind of an overcast sadness, and that's what made me want to watch till the end because I was sure it had to get better. It was light and humorous in several places, though...seeing the romance bloom between Suzanne and Matt was nice and sweet. I got attached to them as a couple.

I had a hard time accepting Matt's new love interest because of Matt and Suzanne's relationship, but in the last scene she redeems herself with the last line of the movie. I do think the ending was kind of rushed, but it did suit the story.

Recommended for romantics everywhere. I've read reviews on here that say it's a pretty good version of the story brought to life so I'm going to read the book soon so I can compare myself.",1225756800,,1068,4.438775510204081
2678260,1,B000JMKKN6,"I read Patterson's book based off this story. The book was great and well worth my time reading it. It is a very short book but I grew so fond of the charactors in the book I forgot for a mintue that they were not real.

The movie could not have sucked more. I did not like any of the charactors. They did not follow the book very much. They did not build the charactors up like the book. It was a complete waste of my time.

The ending was sad like the book but not as touching as the book. The build up sucked and I really had a hard time with the love part of it. The actors seemed to hate each other and there was no chemistry whatso ever between them.

I could not have hated this movie any more than I did.",1193011200,4,712,3.863013698630137
2678261,3,B000JMKKN6,"This film is a based on the novel, written by James Patterson of the same name.  It's clearly from beginning to end dominated by then Christina Applegate's husband Jonathan Schaech (plays Matt Harrison) and Kathleen Ross Perkins (Kate Wilkinson), with Christina Applegate (Suzanne Bedford, Matt's original wife) completing the ensemble.  Primarily placed in contemporary Marth's Vinyard, and having reasonable production values, Suzanne (new town doctor) and Matt (town handyman, house-painter and self-effacing unpublished writer) basically have a peanut butter and jelly style romance, lights-out sex (!#$%$@!), get married and have a baby in that order.  Jumping ahead a few years, Matt, who is completely depressed, somehow finds the initiative and has the incredible luck to make it big with a New York publishing house.  He then is quickly lassoed by his desperately lonely editor, Kate, who falls in love with him at their first luncheon---even before they're served water, I think.  But don't worry, this technically doesn't create a classic love-triangle.  Whew! This does get complex.  So forget about the plot...

Fundamentally, it's a constant swing between the present and the past, with about twenty, best-fit-possible, flash-backs.  Plus, Kathleen Ross Perkins provides a stunning anchor performance.  I think Jonathan did his best to play a manic-depressive but he was probably just too confused as to whether he was playing the ""then-now-past"", ""recent-forgotten-past"", ""historical-past"", ""recent-future"", ""present-time-now-timeline"", ""future-future-present"", or what....which would be confusing for anyone!",1189987200,4,1624,5.931330472103005
2678262,2,B000JMKKN6,"This was so NOT a 5 star movie... it was OK at best, but that's about it. I've heard many people loved the book, but the movie really flopped. My husband called it ""cheesy"" and we both thought the build-up to the ending, although the surprise (won't spoil it here) was certainly sad... seemed to be one of those movie endings that they run out of money and ideas and wrap it all up in 5 minutes. In fact, this would have been a better movie if it were a 30 minute vignette.",1185753600,5,473,4.096774193548387
2678263,5,B000JMKKN6,"This movie is so amazing, it shows how a heart may be healed no matter the difficulties that happened or how past events influenced a present painful situation.

Performings are brilliant, locations are really well chosen, that really make you get into the plot. It's a very nice version of the actual book.

I just love it!",1172620800,12,324,4.666666666666667

2678277,4,B000JMKKN6,"I really enjoyed this movie!  I'm looking for some information about the soundtrack though.  What's the song about 57 minutes in, when they are dancing outside the party, right before she has the baby?  Who is artist performing the song?  I can't seem to find this information anywhere.  The lyrics are partly: ""give me a map of the sea; give me a boat and a blessing"".",1393804800,,369,4.53030303030303

2678283,5,B000JMKKN6,"Get ready people, this is a tear jerker. Nothing is as it seems to be. It shows you just how unexpecting life really is. There's a wonderful lesson to be learned here. Take each day as it is given, & make the most of all the love you can share to each other with all your heart. I thought the acting was superb; I cried through it many times, but was happy at the end when they both were together. A movie for all couples.",1344384000,,422,3.976470588235294

My daughter reccomended it, and I was supposed to record it when it was on TV and forgot.  So I thought well, go online and find it.  Amazon had the best price, and I ordered through a 5 star supplier.  It arrived sooner than expected.  I am truly happy with the whole experience.

Knowing the story did not prepare me for another 'waterfall'! You cannot help yourself; you will get sucked into this story and you can't escape it until it's over! At first, I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch the movie, because I had my doupts about Christina Applegate playing Suzanne, but I am impressed! She is perfect for this role. Anyone who watches this movie and keep a dry eye doesn't have a heart! This movie clearly deserves more than 5 stars!!!",1226361600,,592,4.390909090909091

Matt is bland and annoying, Katie is obnoxious and not how she was described in the book. If I was James Patterson I would be very upset. It seemed like the writers for this movie took images from the book and flipped them around in a way that left the plot line constricted.
