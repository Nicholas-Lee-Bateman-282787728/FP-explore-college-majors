3863223,5,B0027BOL4G,"""Food, Inc."" does more than serve as an expos on the United States food industry--it connects the dots between the nefarious, contemptuous business practices of multinational corporations and their best friends, the compromised government regulatory agencies such as the USDA, FDA, and EPA, who have in the past been led by folks well connected within the very industries they are supposed to regulate.

But let's hold on a minute.  Filmmaker Robert Kenner's documentary could have been just a dour, paranoid investigative piece and still told the truth. Instead, Mr. Kenner has made a colorful, fast-paced, and well-documented account of the state of the food supply in our country; the unintended consequences of the efficiencies, short-cuts, and technological methods inherent in factory farming; the insidious insider relationship between the meat industry and the agencies that should be regulating it; and the health effects, including diabetes, of consuming processed foods and fast foods.

Naturally, the culprits behind the curtain (e.g., Smithfield, Monsanto, Perdue) would not appear on camera, not because they are cowards but precisely because they are so powerfully connected, and have legions of lawyers and enforcers (yes, like any bully, these outfits do use intimidation), and are moving to control free speech and criticism of their practices.

The counterbalance to the doom and gloom comes from interview with small farmers; with entrepreneurs in the organic food business; with the brave folks who have tried to make a stand against the food industry; and with those experts who are striving to be modern day Paul Reveres in the face of mass indifference.

Kenner uses photography and imagery to make his points, and he interlaces this film with scenes of amazing beauty and graphic cruelty. ""Food, Inc."" is not an easy film to watch, and it should not be. Kenner uses the final frames to deliver some to-do's for those who want to respond to the film not just in conversation but through action. As trite as it sounds, if you can only see one movie this year, go to this one. (When the negative review start cropping up for this movie, it would be interesting to see how many of those are from food industry insiders and their minions.)",1242864000,623,2259,5.127717391304348
3863224,5,B0027BOL4G,"Robert Kenner's movie is a perfect illustration of F. William Engdahl's book `Seeds of Destruction', which explains how international agribusinesses are trying to monopolize vertically and horizontally (and profit from) food production on a world scale.

The world's food chain is built mainly on heavily subsidized and, therefore, cheap corn. In fact, all humans chew corn the whole day long from bread over meat (all animals are fed with corn) to deserts and drinks. Transnational corporations are even trying to learn fish to eat corn. Corn becomes nearly a food monoculture.
A particular transnational company even developed through genetic engineering highly efficient corn seed which it patented, thereby creating a nearly seed monopoly. Buyers cannot use the produce of the seeds as plant seed for future harvests. The company's own inspection force controls with hawk eyes that its clients buy new genetically modified seed every year. Some of the company's supporters and former directors occupy key positions in US governments and government administrations (FDA).

The movie shows the disastrous effects of intensive farming on animals, as well as the health and environmental risks of diminished standards at livestock farming and slaughtering houses.
Fortunately, some biological farmers show more respect for their animals and for their clients.

At the end of the movie, the makers give a perfect list of recommendations for those wishing to eat `healthy' food.

This movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.",1241222400,240,1561,5.359183673469388

This movie deals with issues that each and every one of us faces every day--without even knowing it. Covering all sorts of food-related issues, from animal cruelty to the agricultural triumph of corn, this movie will leave you more informed than you were before, and will empower you to make a difference, at least in your own buying habits.

3863275,4,B0027BOL4G,"Is food safety a concern of yours? It certainly should be, but through the industrialization of the food industry and the tendency of politicians to accept donations from large food corporations and look the other way, food safety is being compromised. This trend toward less oversight in pursuit of business interests is the subject of Food, Inc.

I heard about this documentary many years back but never got around to watching it until now. And now that I have watched it, I can say that there is much good educational material here about food manufacturing and the corporations behind it. A food processing plant is an assembly line operation and safety standards are not always followed. Exposure to bacteria and inhumane practices are a regular part of life in the food industry and some of the processes in place to protect the employees and consumers are not as effective as they should be. On the farming end of things, there are issues as well, like questionable ethics regarding the use of genetically modified seeds, the proper way to treat animals, and other concerns. These are covered in Food, Inc., and some of the scenes are disturbing.

There are, of course, two sides to every story but Food, Inc tends to focus on one side, accusing the food industry of hiding the truth as it continues its daily pursuit of profit. However, like the film points out through its use of captioning, several of the largest food producing companies were invited to offer a rebuttal, but all refused. It would be interesting to hear what they would say, as it seems extremely difficult to defend such practices.

The message of this movie is that more regulation is sorely needed to ensure safety but there is another message, and that message relates to you and I, the consumers of food who have the ultimate say. If we make greater demands on how our food is prepared and insist on better treatment of food service employees and animals, then change will occur. Like any business, the food industry has to pay attention to consumer trends and desires and if we, as a whole, start to refuse to eat foods produced in a less than ethical way, the corporate giants will have no choice but to listen. With corporate pressure on the political system and the tendency of a large percentage of politicians to side with business, this is probably our best course of action.

Americas food industry is not without its problems and Food, Inc does a good service educating the people on these important concerns. It doesnt offer a balanced approach, but it does expose some of the important ethical concerns and it serves as an effective call to action.",1510444800,,2641,4.759825327510917

3863329,5,B0027BOL4G,"This documentary of Food Inc. by director Robert Kerner was actually an unexpected discovery and I admit that I am far from the target audience as my husband and I care more about getting the cheapest and tastiest food to maximize the amount of time our food supplies last. This documentary is informative yet may be slanted more towards people who care more about eating the healthiest andor what type of natural ingredients are in the food. There is nothing wrong with this as the documentary shares the heartbreaking story of how a woman went on a crusade to pass stricter food laws after a food situation hit close to home for her (most people who have a heart might get emotionally moved by her story). I am just stating my guess on who the major target audience/demographic may be for this Food Inc. documentary. Some of the other details in this informative documentary that is Food Inc.;brands such as Land O Lakes, Stouffers, Lays, Kellogs etc. are shown. There are references made to the McDonald Brothers in the documentary, food brands such as John Morrell, Swift, Mbpxl, Armour, chicken companies such as Tysons and Perdue, some chicken farmers are interviewed, various food items that can be made out of corn such as cereal brands, syrup, cheese,juice, twinkies, batteries, salad dressing, coke drink, koolaid, charcoal, various fast foods, peanut butter, condiments etc. and much more information. Tysons Grower Vince Edwards is interviewed and Carole Morison, a Perdue grower is interviewed. Some of the other multiple people interviewed in this documentary; Troy Roush Vice President American Corn Growers Association, Larry Johnson Center for Crops Utilization Research Iowa State University, Michael Pollan author of the book Omnivores Dilemma, Allen Trenkle Ruminant Nutrition Expert at Iowa State University, a person interviewed who looked to be the manager of Polyface Farms in Shenandoah Valley Virginia, Beef Products Inc (BPI) in what looked to be the location of South Sioux City Nebraska, mention of USDA building in Washington D.C. etc. I did feel that I got a bargain out of the expansive amount of details that are packed into this Food Inc. documentary by Robert Kerner.",1499558400,,2202,5.1024930747922435

I grew up in different country. We used to complain about meat and why it's so expensive. When we moved to the USA I was pretty surprised how cheap chicken meat here. I admired that farmers are making affordable prices to buy meat. Unfortunately, I was mistaking! I do believe there are some real farmers who produce fresh meat. Now I rather buy 1 pound ground beef from a good trusted farmer rather than trust those Fake Farmers !!!",1488844800,,503,4.478260869565218

It's a great video to watch with kids maybe twelve and up who won't be disturbed by the sight of our awful factory farms.  The big corporations in the food industry are playing hardball with farmers, and the result is we're a less healthy nation, in part because it can be cheaper to buy fast food than to buy produce at the supermarket.  The animals suffer, the farmers suffer, and the consumers suffer.  But there's so much more to the film -- it's full of details about many aspects of our food system.  Ultimately the point Food, Inc. makes is that each of us has the power to transform the way food is produced in this country.  We exercise this power every time we purchase food.  This documentary has definitely transformed the way I think about buying food.  From now on, I'm going to shop more often at the local farmers market.

Remember the Chicken Fast Food COMMERCIAL that has a COW with a sign that says ""Eat more Chikin"" ... after watching this, you might even cut back on the chicken too and Eat More PASTA.  This documentary and others like it, should be watched by the general public (and even kids in high school).

More companies are ADVERTISING ""PASTURE RAISED"" as HEALTHIER FOOD AND MORE HUMANE TREATMENT OF LIVESTOCK.

Remember all of those E-COLI OUTBREAKS that you hear pretty often in the news. These are oftentimes, huge animal feed lots with animals eating corn out of a trough while living and walking in mud and excrement (where the E-COLI comes from) ... And the chickens have a PAINFUL life starting at day one until they're slaughtered, living in closed barracks with NO LIGHT.  Unlike story books or family farm of a hundred years ago, there are NO COWS WANDERING CONTENTED THRU SCENIC PASTURES WITH GRASS AND FLOWERS.  First, comes CORPORATE PROFIT, COSTS and EFFICIENCY then the PUBLIC MARKETING.

The film brings out alternative, REALISTIC viewpoints, such as local CO-OPS of family farms for people who may be concerned about HEALTHIER food and MAYBE the Humane treatment of livestock (at least for their DAY TO DAY LIVING CONDITIONS) for most of their life.
Consider that COWS, PIGS and even CHICKENS are at the SAME LEVEL of Intelligence, Feelings and Emotions as your FAMILY DOG or the HORSE that you ride on vacation.  Just because we ONLY SEE what's left of them in the SUPERMARKET PLASTIC WRAP, does that REALLY make it  ""HUMANE"".  At least consider supporting those (smaller) companies and Co-Ops (Meat and Dairy) who try to give their livestock a relatively decent life.  You don't have to become a vegetarian, but maybe eat pasta of fish more often and READ the MARKETING LABELS more carefully.

*** Go to the Internet Sites for ""ORGANIC VALLEY"" and ""VITAL FARMS"" and NESTFRESH"" as an example and find out WHICH SUPERMARKETS support these Co-Ops.  You might pay an extra dollar or two, but supporting the right thing to do has to start somewhere.

3863435,5,B0027BOL4G,"This documentary, is crucial for anyone that consumes food. Food Inc., documents the modern day industrialization of our food system, and how this has had an adverse effect on the health of the nation. As a consumer of food, I appreciate learning where my food comes from and how it is being treated, from farm to plate. This documentary uncovers the disgusting conditions that modern day factory farmers leave their animals in, and how some farmers are being exploited by large companies, like Monsanto. It also shows, how the pricing of food has an effect on the health of lower income families. They show one family, and how it is much cheaper for them to buy fast food, rather than purchasing fresh produce. This documentary had very convincing graphs and statistics to prove their point. I am a huge fan of this documentary, and how they went further than regular documentaries to find the truth. If you are looking to educate yourself on modern day conditions of our food system, this documentary will do it. Before first watching this, I wasn't aware of the extent of how poorly food is produced, and how many people are being taken advantage of in the process. Now, after seeing it I feel like I can make, more informed and educated decisions about where I purchase food and how to prepare it. For those looking to show a food documentary to their children, I wouldnt suggest this one. It has very graphic imagery of animals being slaughtered and how they are being abused in the process. Overall, I believe this documentary shows the reality of our food system, and the major effect it has had on us as a society. If you show this to anyone, it will be an eye opening experience for them.",1481414400,,1697,4.641196013289036

3863443,4,B0027BOL4G,"""Food, Inc"" is a really influential movie, as it got me thinking about how healthy I really am and what I need to change about my diet. It caused me to reevaluate the foods I eat, and it was very eye-opening.  ""Food, Inc"" touches a lot on meats and what exactly is in the meat we are eating.  Many people are aware of what is in meats, which is why many people are vegetarians, and why I will most likely become one after watching this documentary.  However, meats were not the only thing mentioned in Food, Inc..  The documentary also made clear to the audience that there are things we should not want in our systems, such as chemicals, in basically everything we eat, including vegetables and fruits.  The purpose of this documentary is to inform the public with information we may not be aware of when eating every day food.  ""Food, Inc."" talked about supermarkets and corn, meats such as beef, chicken, and pork, processed foods, and industrial farms.  The audience was able to go behind the scenes to see how all of these different foods are made.  After seeing this documentary, I believe the main focus is to make people aware of what these foods contain and what they can do to your body.
 Food is obviously a crucial part of everyones lives, as it should be.  Everyone needs food to survive, its delicious, it gives you energy, and can benefit you in many ways.  However, when you devour food because of its deliciousness, you can lose thought of what exactly you're eating.  I now realize that some of the snacks I eat that I once considered to be healthy such as grapes, bananas, or cheese sticks, probably had some sort of chemicals mixed in, as well.  The documentary tells us that even though we think foods like tomatoes that we buy at the store are good for us, they are picked when green and then ripened with ethylene gas.  If we were not taught about what is in our food, we would be unaware and would not be trying to avoid foods that we used to think were okay to eat.  I know that some families do not have the option of eating healthy due to money issues, but if families are able to, I believe it is important for everyone to start changing how they eat because not only will it make people feel better, but it will improve our country's health in the long run.
 For the past two years, I have been sensitive to gluten.  I know I cannot speak for everyone, but generally when people are diagnosed with celiac or a gluten allergy, they are devastated.  After all, there are so many great foods out there that have gluten in their recipe!  So what do these people do after their diagnosis?  They go to the store and buy everything they normally eat, just the gluten free version (e.g. pasta, pizza, cookies).  Some people even go on gluten free diets because they hear it is healthier.  After watching ""Food, Inc."", I got to thinking and started researching gluten free processed food.  It turns out that some gluten free processed food can be even worse for you then the original, because of all the added chemicals.  Over the past two years, I have had to make major adjustments to my diet.  I do not always eat gluten free labeled foods such as gluten free bread or pasta because I personally don't like the taste, but also because I can avoid gluten simply by eating whole organic foods with no gluten in the recipe.  Being allergic to gluten has made me a much healthier person, or so I thought, but after watching ""Food, Inc."", I am second-guessing my food choices all over again.
 I believe that the producers of the foods we eat should make it very clear as to what we are eating and what the exact ingredients are in our food.  It is not fair to the consumers that we should have to feel skeptical about what we are eating and have to worry that we are not being told the whole truth.  In order for producers to make us more aware, they should have to include very detailed labels on the foods they produce.  Once that is done on their part, it is our job as the consumers to read the labels and educate ourselves on the foods we are consuming.
  Overall, ""Food, Inc"" was an extremely eye-opening documentary.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to understand what is in the foods we eat regularly, and if they would like to find out how to change their diet to become a much healthier person.  ""Food, Inc"" has caused me to reevaluate the foods I consume, and I am extremely grateful for that.",1480636800,,4439,4.426108374384237

3863487,5,B0027BOL4G,"Food, Inc came out over seven years ago, and in that time I've seen the food industry change so much.

This documentary is about the food industry, and how the major meat and poultry manufacturers grow and get their products to us. It's eye-opening in the way the animals we eat are treated as a commodity and not given a second thought to their feelings. They are just products in an assembly line. It discusses the dangers in terms of disease that arises from the conditions these animals are forced to live in, and the power these manufacturers have. It also documents a growing movement of farmers who are growing their own free-range animals and treated humanely.

As someone that just came back from a trip overseas (Laos), in a country of basically independent farmers, I've seen free roaming cows, chickens, pigs, and other animalsthis is how they should be treated. It's not only for the animal's sake but it really all comes down to taste. I've never tasted food this delicious. The care the farmers provide to their animals shows in the end. I've tasted organic meats from Whole Foods, and I've tasted meats in Laos, the difference is immediate, Laos meats tasted even better. I had to ask my parents what they put in their food. ""Nothing,"" they said. ""Not even salt and pepper?"" ""No"". (The truth is they use some MSG, which has an inaccurate reputation. MSG isn't bad for you. Glutamates are naturally occurring in all kinds of foods. In the words of Anthony Bourdain, Chinese restaurant syndrome was created by racism.) In any case, with or without the MSG, it was still a step up in taste compared to Whole Foods.

Food, Inc starts as a sad tale of an assembly line industry but ends up looking hopeful as the consumer's voices have spoken as to what we want: organic food options, and we're willing to pay for it. I'm glad the market is listening and giving us more humane and healthier options. Recommended.",1478304000,7,1923,4.666666666666667

3863734,5,B0027BOL4G,"This will change your life!  For most Americans, the ideal meal is fast, cheap, and tasty. Food, Inc. examines the costs of putting value and convenience over nutrition and environmental impact. Director Robert Kenner explores the subject from all angles, talking to authors, advocates, farmers, and CEOs, like co-producer Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation), Michael Pollan (The Omnivore's Dilemma), Gary Hirschberg (Stonyfield Farms), and Barbara Kowalcyk, who's been lobbying for more rigorous standards since E. coli claimed the life of her two-year-old son. The filmmaker takes his camera into slaughterhouses and factory farms where chickens grow too fast to walk properly, cows eat feed pumped with toxic chemicals, and illegal immigrants risk life and limb to bring these products to market at an affordable cost. If eco-docs tends to preach to the converted, Kenner presents his findings in such an engaging fashion that Food, Inc. may well reach the very viewers who could benefit from it the most: harried workers who don't have the time or income to read every book and eat non-genetically modified produce every day. Though he covers some of the same ground as Super-Size Me and King Corn, Food Inc. presents a broader picture of the problem, and if Kenner takes an understandably tough stance on particular politicians and corporations, he's just as quick to praise those who are trying to be responsible--even Wal-Mart, which now carries organic products. That development may have more to do with economics than empathy, but the consumer still benefits, and every little bit counts. --Kathleen C. Fennessy",1454803200,3,1619,5.299610894941634

With the combination of how our food is manufactured, yes manufactured. through its feed, lack of clean space and grazing, and to maltreatment is it any wonder we have enough to nourish us anymore. The one thing manufacturers have not realized is how to add the all the vitamins, antioxidants,minerals, micro and macro nutrients to our food that only come with growing, nurturing and keeping the land and livestock healthy. Real health from fresh air, sunshine, and humane treatment that keeps produce and livestock at it best.

3863919,5,B0027BOL4G,"WHAT IF THERE WAS A CURE FOR OBESITY, CANCER, ALZHEIMERS, ADD, & AUTISM, BUT BIG BUSINESS WAS HUSHING IT UP? Can't say enough about this video. I wish it were required for students, but the threat on our economy by the things it shows would shift around some wealth in a big way. And Big Business carries a Big Stick in Washington. The final point is, if we want change in the food industry, we vote with every meal. Changing the industry may require a financial burden on families, but the government will not make the changes when people would rather eat unhealthy food cheaply and save their money for diet pills, prescription drugs, and cancer treatment.

This video goes hand in hand with FED UP, which deals with sugar and hints at the mum-order put on Michelle Obama when she tried to make the nation aware of the problem.

Also recommended follow-up is the book BRAIN MAKER by neurosurgeon David Perlmutter.  This explains the inner workings of the gut and its effect on neurological problems like Alzheimers, Autism, and ADD.  He calls Alzheimers Type 3 Diabetes.

3864025,5,B0027BOL4G,"Food INC. is an informative and educational examination of America's food and agricultural industries. There are but a small handful of corporate farms who grow or raise our food that you find in just about every chain grocery store and market stretching from cost to coast. As incredible of a feat as it may appear, ""peer through the veil"" as it is stated in the documentary. Our food is controlled by these very large, multi billion dollar industries and what you see isn't necessarily what you get. From raising genetically modified live stock fed on all corn GMO diets and fed/injected with antibiotics and growth hormones to the GMO Monsanto corn and soy beans that are grown and used in virtually EVERYTHING the average American consumes. After getting this small bit of information....you will be scared (or at least very, very weary) of shopping at your local grocery store or market. Food Inc. is an educational study of awareness made available to the average consumer, ""this is what is in your food, this is what you are eating, and these are the people who are feeding it to you and getting RICH off of you and your dwindling health"". It just doesn't stop there, the economic costs of corporate America controlling  America's food also has its costs. Neighboring countries and countries of trade suffer as smaller family farms can't compete with the production of what these corporate farms can crank out and thus ""go out of business"".People's very livelihood comes to an end and migrant workers who are urged to come to America (often as undocumented workers) work  virtually as slaves and then thrown to the wolves when it suites the company. You and I all ""pay for that"" and it is a vicious, repeating circle that seems to have no end. I urge anyone to see this documentary and you will think twice about the food you eat and what you buy. You will be asking yourself who it is really benefitting, and I guarantee you...""It isn't you or your family"".",1430438400,2,1965,4.742690058479532

I think this is a must see in order to understand how our food industry is controlled by a few large corporations. And it is daunting to see that we could easily be eating cheap and contaminating foods all in the name of profits. It is frightening and discouraging  to see how those small companies or family owned businesses who get in the way of those few large companies or don't adhere to their rules can be quashed so easily or worse bankrupted.

3864103,1,B0027BOL4G,"This movie is not a documentary. It's a morbid  fairytale that's as much based in reality as a fiction movie that was inspired by true events. The filmmakers exploit your emotions with images of animals being abused (much of which is illegal activity and never happens unless someone with a camera is there instigating it) and farmers done wrong to drive home a point about how you should let Jim-Bob down the road grow your food instead of someone that's been doing it for four generations and abides by government regulations. You think all those Midwestern farmers are just gonna move all over the country to be everybody's local farmer?

Anyway my biggest problem with this movie (and lots of other documentaries) is their REFUSAL to consult experts in these matters. You never see agricultural college professors or researchers in this movie because they knew these people and their annoying ""facts"" would get in the way of their point.

I haven't watched or read any other films/books by the people involved in this production, but none of this was really new to me, either. The film was better than I expected, and more balanced that I expected. The tone seemed very pragmatic. Rather than shrieking ""oh my god can you believe what these people are doing?"" it looks at how the American food economy came to be this way, and why it continues. The one thing I wish the film dug into more was the legislative side of it. We heard a lot from farmers and consumers, but nothing from the lawmakers who make the decisions for what kinds of agriculture to subsidize. I assume -- and hope -- that their motivations are deeper than just being paid by lobbyists to vote a certain way. Lastly, I liked that there were a few glimmers of hope for the future in the story.

I found it to be not only shocking but it goes along with several other documentaries I've seen about our water, our rights, etc. Money runs the country and people just don't matter any more. It was terrifying to see that woman  who lost a son having to watch what words she used for fear of being sued. I watched Oprah go through her ordeal with the beef industry and thought that's just crazy! Well, it isn't crazy at all, it's our reality! To actually have ""seed police"" hounding the farmers like KGB agents? Not even being able to talk to their friends? I can't imagine the fear these people go through with the high-powered, money saturated companies just waiting for them to make a wrong move, and knowing eventually they're going to get the ax anyway. I think the world is being controlled by sociopaths, no conscience, no empathy, not a care as to what they're doing. It's unbelievable.",1424304000,,920,4.609756097560975

3864187,5,B0027BOL4G,"Food, Inc. is a documentary directed by Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Robert Kenner. It examines the current state of America's food supply, and suggests that the over-industrialization of food production is making the nation sicker by the moment. Also,it analyzes the proliferation of chemical additives in ""natural"" foods, looks at the relationship between the lack of nutrients in the American diet and the nation's rising health care costs, and offers tips for system detoxification.

The film's first segment examines the industrial production of meat, calling it inhumane and economically and environmentally unsustainable. The second segment looks at the industrial production of grains and vegetables(corn and soy beans), again labeling this economically and environmentally unsustainable. The film's third and final segment is about the economic and legal power, such as food label laws of the major food companies, the profits of which are based on supplying cheap but contaminated food, the heavy use of petroleum-based chemicals, and the promotion of unhealthy food consumption habits by the American public.

For most Americans, the ideal meal is fast, cheap, and tasty. This documentary examines the costs of putting value and convenience over nutrition and environmental impact. It explores the subject from all angles, talking to authors, advocates, farmers, and CEOs alike. If eco- docs tends to preach to the converted, it presents its findings in such an engaging fashion that it may well reach the very viewers who could benefit from it the most: harried workers who don't have the time or income to read every book and eat non-genetically modified produce every day. Also,it presents a broader picture of the problem, and if it takes an understandably tough stance on particular politicians and corporations and its just as quick to praise those who are trying to be responsible.",1423699200,,1899,5.433898305084746

3864192,5,B0027BOL4G,"We all need to eat food to survive the question is what is in our food that is exactly what this film talks about from different angles first of all the corporate control angle: TYSON, CARGILL, SWIFT, & NATIONAL BEEF CONTROL 80% OF THE BEEF MARKET, and now we move over to THE PORK MARKET OF WHICH 80% IS CONTROLLED BY TYSON, CARGILL, SWIFT, & SMITHFIELD. Rather than farmers working for themselves, now they're called GROWERS, VINCE EDWARDS IS A TYSON GROWER WHO HAS A CHICKEN FARM, CAROLE MARISON IS A PERDUE GROWER, SHE HAS THE INNER COURAGE AND CONVICTION TO CRITICIZE PERDUE SHE SAYS ""THIS IS NOT FARMING THIS IS MASS PRODUCTION LIKE IN A FACTORY."" A typical grower with 2 chicken houses has borrowed over $500,000 and earns about $18,000 a year.
Did you know that 30% of farm land in the U.S. is being planted with corn, here are a few products that have some form of corn in them: KETCHUP, CHEESE, TWINKIES, BATTERIES, PEANUT BUTTER, CHEEZ-ITS, SALAD DRESSING, COKE, JELLY, SWEET & LOW, SYRUP, JUICE, KOOL-AID, CHARCOAL, DIAPERS, MOTRIN, MEAT, AND FAST FOOD, corn is also a major part of animal feed for cows, even certain fish feed has corn ingredients in it.
Here are some interesting points made in this film:
1. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN EATS 200 POUNDS OF MEAT PER-PERSON PER-YEAR.
2. RATHER THAN HAVING COW FARMS WE NOW HAVE CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS(CAFOs) THESE COWS ARE FED CORN NOT GRASS.
3. REMEMBER THE E-COLI OUTBREAKS-COW MANURE IN BEEF.
4. IN 1972 THE FDA CONDUCTED APPROXIMATELY 50,000 FOOD SAFETY INSPECTIONS.
5. IN 2006 THE FDA CONDUCTED 9,164 FOOD SAFETY INSPECTIONS.
6. IN THE 1970s THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SLAUGHTER HOUSES IN THEU.S.( I PERSONALLY REMEMBER THE SLAUGHTER HOUSES ON 14th STREET & 10th AVENUE IN NEW YORK CITY) AS OF 2008 THERE ARE 13 SLAUGHTER HOUSES IN THE ENTIRE U.S.
A very compelling segment of this film is when BARBARA KOWALCYK & HER MOTHER BECOME FOOD SAFETY ADVOCATES FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF BARBARA'S 2 & A HALF YEAR OLD SON KEVIN, HE DIED FROM AN E-COLI INFECTION. This film also talks about the connection between fast-food and diabetes:
1. 1 IN 3 AMERICANS BORN AFTER THE YEAR 2000 WILL CONTACT EARLY ONSET DIABETES.
2. AMONG MINORITIES THAT RATE WILL 1 IN 2.
There is also a very interesting segment about the monstrous corporation MONSANTO, at the end of this film there are easy to follow suggestions of how this fight against the food corporations can be fought and won by us the everyday paying customers, every person in America needs to watch this educational and informative DVD film.",1423008000,,2554,4.754504504504505

I do think we should require food producers to be humane and use chemicals the least as possible, I think many fail to see the positives. We can afford to feed lots of people and famine has essentially been eradicated in our country. Less than 100 years ago, this wasn't the case. The bottom line is that we care about such issues covered on this film because we can afford to. I highly doubt any third world country would care. First world problems. The reason we are fat is because we eat too much andove too little. Lambast the auto and oil industries, too. ""Organic"" is a label that means very little. If one truly cares, it's best to grow your own and eat very little meat, which, organic or not, is bad for you in large quantities and very bad for the environment.",1414972800,,862,4.3602484472049685

There is no reason why animals raised  for our consumption should be tortured and abused while being raised.  Sickening.

If more people would only educate themselves on this issue, so much change could happen - for the good, of course.  Not only by getting rid of factory farms but also by reducing the diseases humans get from eating so many corrupted foods.  Even foods we thought were good for us.  Yes, apples are good for us but not if they are contaminated with so many pesticides and other chemicals that tumors pop up in our intestines.

Michael Pollan obviously stars in the movie and is going to be very good for his very lucrative speaking business - good for him, he should spread the word on what's going on in each and everyone of our kitchens. If this movie is even half right and it's conclusions, it's still frightening.

The majority of Americans simply don't know what goes on behind the scenes in the corporate dominated and consolidated food industry specifically designed for mass production and to supply McDonalds - who buy 25% of the beef in the US. Staggering.

I hate spending $5 for an organic carton of milk, don't like the hassle of buying locally grown food and have been to about 2 farmers markets in my life, but I've completely rethought my ways after watching this movie. Highly recommended.",1406678400,,1006,4.7371428571428575
3864522,4,B0027BOL4G,"I really don't like activists.  In my opinion, their sole purpose is to make sure the supposed ""problems"" they're exposing never go away, so they can stay relevant.  Really.  Think about it.  What does the anti-GM activist have to live for, once his friend obama outlaws GM crops?  Oh wait...that's right...obama's USDA just gave the green light to GM alfalfa.  Oh well.  The battle will continue.

Having said all that, it's important to note that this film was made in 2009--when the Bush-hate was still fresh on every leftist's mind and the new dawn of enlightenment had just begun.  It's a well-done documentary with good production.  But basically it's just the typical ration of red meat for the anti-Perdue, anti-Monsanto faithful--perfect for a screening at Acres USA, right before the Mark Kastel plenary session.

It has all the elements of the sort of anti-corporate, conspiratorial dreck that poisons unbiased thinking and creates unnecessary mistrust.  The farmers who are being ""dominated"" and ""victimized"" by Monsanto's seed suppliers.  The chicken producer who has the courage to speak out, but not the courage to quit such a reprehensible livelihood and do something better for her kids, herself and her planet.  The Hispanics (presumably immigrants) who don't make enough money to buy their kids decent food and have to resort to Ray Kroc's evil empire for sustenance.  Yep.  It's about food, but manages to flirt with immigration reform, too.  There's more than one reference to George Bush in it.  Of course, there's no indication of how legislators in food-producing states are influenced by those industries, so we'd never know if one of the courageous democrats was actually tainted with money traceable to Tyson or Syngenta.

I just can't take it seriously when Joel Salatin, the sanctimonious rock-star of the homesteading movement, tells the cameras how there's no need for mass meat processing, when everybody can be fed by butchering chickens and hogs piecemeal--then claims in the next segment he has no desire to expand his operation.  Which, by implication, is the model of better, safer, more ethical meat production.  I mean, wouldn't you want to show people how to do that, if that's what you think is best? You know, make it the industry standard?  Nah.  I guess not, if doing so means you'll lose market share on those $3/dozen eggs, and those lucrative speaking engagements.

It sure would be nice if these crusaders who are so worried about where we get food would be as interested in finding out how our corrupt government has made every aspect of business more onerous, difficult and cumbersome in this country.

3864535,5,B0027BOL4G,very good..I have poultry houses and it really takes guts for someone to do what Carole Morison did.  What you hear her say and what you see in the film it is the unfiltered truth.  It ain't grandma's chicken coop like on the packaging.  The romantic image and the harsh reality are worlds apart  One thing I learned was the tremendous amount of government welfare these companies receive through subsidies paid to individual farmers.  Not sure any other industry can buy supplies at less than production costs.  No better return on investment than to stuff the coffers of a few politicians in the right slots.,1405382400,,610,4.761904761904762

3864537,5,B0027BOL4G,"I bought this film from Amazon, and, later, bought a similar film titled FORKS OVER KNIVES. I thoroughly enjoyed them both. My late sister and her husband owned a farm in western Illinois. We didn't talk livestock in depth, but I do remember taking tours of her farm and appreciating the clear, clean farm air -- even near the pigpens. I also remember Monsanto from living in the St. Louis area for years.  This film, however, shed new light on farm-raised animal products and on the Monsanto company.  It made me realize what my sister and her husband might have had to deal with . . . and what other farmers endured when dealing with Monsanto and the modified corn seed.

It also made me stop eating meat.

Even starker than this film is FORKS OVER KNIVES.  FED UP is another recent film which we saw in a movie theatre. If these three films don't make you start to read labels and ease your eating of meat . . . and sugar . . . good luck.",1405123200,4,941,4.293785310734464

3864662,5,B0027BOL4G,"This is the second time I have watched this excellent documentary, and it was just as fascinating. It breaks through common myths and misconceptions about how our food gets from ""farm"" to table and winds up on grocery store shelves. Do you envision happy cows grazing in the sun in a lush, green pasture when you drink that glass of milk or eat a hamburger? Think again!

 Food is a giant industry controlled by a handful of greedy corporations. Those ""sunny pastures"" look more like concentration camps, where animals stand knee-deep in their own manure and can barely move due to overcrowding. They are given antibiotic-laced feed to help them survive long enough to go to the slaughter house, and some are actually fed parts of other dead animals. As for that milk that does a body good, did you know that a certain amount of pus is acceptable in the finished product?

This film also explores the industry from the viewpoint of the factory workers, who bring hidden cameras into some of the largest meat production facilities in the world. What they reveal is sad and shocking, both for themselves and for the animals.

I have never been a vegetarian or an animal-rights activist, but this film has really opened my eyes. I have decided to make much more conscious choices about what I eat and to start giving my money to local farmers and companies that still have a moral compass.

I have been disgusted with the food industry for some time but the truth is our ignorance has contributed to the problem because if we wouldn't buy it this could not continue.

The health of the population is at risk from a number of new conditions brought on by filthy, diseased, over medicated , and brutally treated animals.  Water systems in a number of middle-American communities are contaminated by agricultural runoff.  Even animals deserve a better existence.
Those who would like to change these practices are bankrupted or otherwise intimidated by powerful chemical and agribusiness legal teams and lobbyists.

There is a great disconnect between our grocery store purchases and knowing where this food is coming from and being pumped full of chemicals, hormones, pesticides, etc is alarming to me!

What I found the most interesting (read disturbing) was the treatment of the animals that are bred and raised for food. Tyson and Purdue should be heavily regulated and fined for the disreputable practices they appear to be using to keep their chicken farmers under their thumb. It was extremely brave to the one person to allow access to show her chicken sheds to the film crew. And beef, besides being penned in and restricted they are mainly fed corn which also turns out to be one of the main culprits in the fattening of America.

The portion of the film that shows the one farm in Virginia that raises their animals in a more natural environment with no corn feed was extremely interesting. The cattle eat natural grass and then drop the manure which naturally fertilizes the soil to grow more grass and also attracts bugs and insects for the chickens to eat as they follow in the path of the cows feeding. Very natural and super efficient.

That farm gives tours and has an event in July to show people just how they operate. Planning to visit it to see the more natural method of raising our food animals. We should respect the animals that provide us with our food and this seems to me to be the way to do it.",1396483200,,1327,4.479338842975206

The ugly: They push ""buy local."" Great...except MOST Americans can't afford farmer's markets, they can barely afford fresh fruit and vegetables. Plus, they don't address some basic problems. For example, I live in Chicago. If I only bought local I would never get an orange or banana. Cheese would be a challenge, but oh boy would I be drowning in cereal crops...you know, the things that make us obese and cause heart disease.

3864838,4,B0027BOL4G,"Food, Inc. is a documentary film that looks to expose what the reality of the food industry is. The film presents multiple sides of the food industry, which include crops, food processing, and food labeling regulations. The film focuses on major food companies and how their actions and methods have affected consumers and the way the marked has gone forward in bettering itself.
The documentary begins by presenting how many of our meats are processed; specifically chicken and beef. We are taken through the process of how chicken is farmed and delivered onto our plates. At first it seems that farmers will allow the viewers an insight look into how they're poultry is actually delivered to them, but many refuse to be interviewed or back out due to fear of losing major contracts. One farmer allows camera crews to get a look into how these chickens are raised. The farmers reveal that the chickens are engineered to grow faster, within 48 days, in order to meet the necessities of the many corporations. Most of these chickens have never seen sunlight and as shown in the documentary, they cannot even hold themselves up due to the extensive growth of their internal organs. The reason behind why many farmers continue with these inhumane practices is revealed to be that many are in debt and are afraid to speak up in fear that the will lose contracts that they need in order to stay inn business.
 The film transitions into the grains and vegetable production portion of the food industry. Its main focus is that of corn and how many uses have come from it and what we can expect from it. Due to many laws that protects and subsidize the price of corn there seems to be a large abundance of corn, as represented in this film from 2008. The large of abundance of corn has allowed many scientists to engineer high fructose syrup that consumers take in which could be found in many of the products to this day. However this has begun the phenomenon of cows being corn instead of grass. This has resulted in e-coli bacteria being found in meat. When the cattle eat corn, they become more at risk of creating these bacteria. Also since they are contained in smallholdings, they tend to stand in feces, which do not help in keeping them bacteria free. This is done because many investors in the food industry want meat to be produced cheaply, so they too can buy it cheaply. The documentary presents McDonalds as on of the culprits, since they buy most of the beef in the food industry and profit the most from it.
 The film turns its focus on the American family and shows how they are the main ones being effected by all of these discrepancies being caused and overlooked by not only the food industry but also the FDA. We are taken into the day of a family whom seems to relay on fast food as a primary source of income and seem to validate this with by making a claim that a hamburger for a dollar a day would be cheaper than them getting vegetables at a grocery store which are usually by the pound and for more than a dollar. Also the narrator of the documentary presents very real facts about the rising health risks and diseases that are incorporated with eating processed meats and how it is no longer just affecting older individuals, but also the youth.
 The documentary also covers the legal side of how meat is produced and the regulation around it. It follows a few advocators who are attempting to change things for the better, but also seem to start becoming frustrated in how things are not taking place fast enough. The documentary places its fair enough of emphasis of how the USDA has lowered its inspections since the 70s even though the market for meat has grown larger.
 The documentary does a great job of showing its argument and representing the negative side of how the industry is handling things; however it does give a glimmer of hope when interviewing many advocators and farms who oppose these newer methods of raising meat produce and growing crops. It even goes as far as attempting to reach out to representatives of Tyson Foods, Perdue farms, and many other companies but were turned down. The documentary does a really good job in showing and stating its facts, not only through narration, but also representing facts and visual evidence gathered from many different areas in which these factories can be found. What film could have included was different areas of America where processed food was contributing to the obesity the greatest. It focused on maybe one or two families that were affected by the produce, but not enough people were focused on to give a fair representation of the population. This film does not credit itself for breaking into the scene, but it does give supermarkets or retails stores that sell poultry and crops, the credit they deserve fro trying to progress and move forward with becoming more health aware and attempting to provide better foods for the public.",1395100800,,4929,4.681660899653979
3864839,4,B0027BOL4G,"In Food Inc., director Robert Kenner takes a muckraker's approach as he examines the ways in which health and safety are overlooked and ignored when it comes to food production. This shocking expose shines a dim light on the many unfortunate truths about large scale food production taking place daily in the United States.

 Our nation's entire food production is controlled by only a few multinational corporations. These companies put profit ahead of consumer health and wellbeing, causing the nation, as a whole, to suffer. Kenner highlights the fact that only four companies control 80% of our meat today whereas in 1970  six companies produced 20% of our meat. This giant shift throughout the years is as alarming as the presence of contamination and lack of nutrition in our food today. Perhaps the most saddening story in Food Inc. is the story of a young, healthy boy who ate an E-coli contaminated burger and died only 12 days later. The lack of regulation and standards when it comes to reducing pathogens in meat are what prompted groups to fight for the legislation of Kevin's Law, in memory of the boy who died from E-coli.

 This documentary exposes the fact that industries don't want you to know the truth about what you are really eating.  In Food, Inc., only one ""farmer"" agreed to filming in their chicken houses. The reality is that food is produced in factories, not farms. Corporations have taken sickening steps to generate profit. Food, Inc. pulls on viewers' heart strings as clips of large numbers of cattle forced together in tight spaces are shown and chicken houses of thousands of chickens living in complete darkness for their whole lives. A standard chicken is born and grows fully in three months which has been cut down dramatically to 48 days. These chickens are also fed genetically modified food to make them fatter, faster. It is hard to shake the inhumane and unsanitary conditions imposed on the livestock. The cruel circumstances that these animals have to endure are hard to watch  at many points in the documentary, but the effect this food production has on human beings has taken an even more devastating toll.

 Food, Inc. opens with the thought provoking sentence, ""The way we eat has changed more dramatically in the past 50 years than in the previous 10,000 years."" Now, more than ever before, we are oblivious to the food we put in our bodies. Kenner jokingly states that there are no seasons in the supermarket anymore. Any type of food is available year round, thanks to genetic modification. An alarming 70% of processed foods in American supermarkets contain genetically modified ingredients. Nowadays, our food is drowned in sugar and refined carbohydrates, leaving the list of what is okay to buy and eat rather short. For many people though, the quickest choice is usually the one that wins, every time. A hungry family in the documentary is fed by a fast food restaurant for only $11.42. Although terribly unhealthy and high in calories and carbohydrates, it is the most cost effective decision for them. A trip to the grocery store only discourages the family more, as they do not have enough money to buy the expensive fruits and vegetables. We are subsidizing food that makes us sick. Because of subsidized corn, it's less costly to buy the double cheeseburgers and sodas instead of the nonsubsidized head of broccoli.

 Who we are as a nation is redefined as we become overwhelmed with a large population of obese. By 2030, 42% of Americans will be obese. If that isn't a wake up call, I don't know what is. It is sad to learn about the large number of obese children as well as the rising rate of diabetes in the U.S. In a teen advocacy group portrayed in the documentary, almost everyone raised their hand when asked if they knew somebody with diabetes. It quickly becomes a reality check as we wonder if healthy homemade meals are now a thing of the past.

 Food, Inc. details the ways in which corporate giants look for ways to increase efficiency and profits with destructive consequences for consumers. This jaw dropping expose revealing e-coli contaminated beef, chickens too large to walk, pesticide flooded vegetables, and ammonia washed beef are only a few of the factors that make up what's become of modern day food production. These grim and unsettling facts lead to a long list of health issues including obesity and diabetes as the most prevalent. Although unfortunate to learn more about the often overlooked factors that affect animals, workers and consumers, it is informative nonetheless. After an extremely eye opening 90 minutes, the film ends with a positive message to its viewers. This unhealthy food system can be changed by the people living within it. By purchasing food from companies that treat its workers, animals and consumers with decency, and buying organic, locally grown fruits and vegetables we can pave the way for future generations.",1395014400,,4935,4.902877697841727

We are so busy trying to eat healthy that we never stop to wonder how these animals are being slaughtered for our consumption; we just want it and the manufacturer provides it but at what cost?  These poor animals are enduring the worst treatment I've ever imagined and I couldn't be more upset at not choosing to be vegan earlier in life.  I had no idea they slaughter baby chicks just because they are male, the unGodly mistreatment of cows, female chickens, pigs, etc.  This video exposes some things but not all.  After researching further, I found some outrageous videos of how they really handle the chickens, cows and pigs; most being cut, skinned and scorched while still alive.

There's more to the cost of food than the $$ at the checkstand: the suffering of the animals, food additives like hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, GMOs, reduced health benefits from grain-fed vs grass-fed meat, etc.  It makes me want to search out more locally grown food and produce more myself.  I already have chickens for eggs and may try Free Ranger chickens for meat- they are bred to free range yet still put on weight fast enough to be used for meat.  The production of this film was excellent- it should have won awards.  Just checked.

We try to educate them about our choices, but excuse the pun, we don't feel it is fair to force our choices down their throats. If we had raised them this way, that would be a different thing but to force them to make a switch at this time, is not something we feel comfortable doing. My daughter had to leave the room while watching the slaughter house scenes. It upset her that much. I told her I was sorry that it was so disturbing, but ""now that your old enough, you need to know the truth about where your hamburger and steak comes from.""  The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is that I think the documentary tries to cover too much ground. It is a bit too long and could use some editing. Also, although it obviously tries not to take sides on political parties (republicans vs democrats), I think it does in a way that is unnecessary and in doing so runs the risk of polarizing some who will reject the message as just another documentary driven by a political agenda. It isn't a big deal, but I could have done without some of that. Otherwise, it is a powerful and worthwhile documentary that will push many out of their comfort zone and force them to think in new ways about what we choose to put in our bodies.",1389312000,3,1404,4.2781954887218046

All that is left in the area is huge, sicking, milking ""factories"" where the animals suffer (as well as the workers) therefore not producing a safe product! WAKE UP PEOPLE!

Its so sad to see that the farming region of the USA is truly being forced to grow GMO corn, GMO soybeans... These are Round-up ready seeds full of BT toxins that are causing this next generation of kids to have an increase in all sorts of auto immune diseases, allergies, cancers etc. Most farmers think it is great to buy these seeds (or their only choice!) but when it turns into food and enters the grocery stores/fast food chains in the form of bread and cereals, etc. I will be the consumer who will never buy it. This type of ""food"" should be labeled!

If animals are not allowed to roam and eat what they were created to do then how can that possibly be healthy for us? Every time we purchase something that is ""on sale"" we are voting on it. It is the law of supply and demand. We have found a farmer who follows Joel Salatin's method of farming to be environmentally conscious and treat the animals humanely.

Sure, we would all love to be able to buy grass fed, GMO free, locally grown,  free range, etc. meat and vegetables. But like everything else, it comes down to dollars and effort. I own a BBQ food truck that sells pork, chicken, and beef. I checked around with all of the local beef and pork producers in my state. The cheapest I can get grass fed beef brisket for is $6.02 per pound. I currently pay $2.26 per lb. If I bought the grass fed, I would have to charge $10.50 for a sandwich to cover labor and food cost to make any kind of profit. And while there might be a few people who might pay this, I can bet I would be out of business in no time. I would be willing to pay $3.50 lb for brisket, but that would be as high as I could go.

Maybe all of the local farmers could pull together and find a way to get the price a little closer to the grocer and it might take off. This is how Redbox put the movie stores out of business. But for now, as soon as folks see this film and they are pissed\scared enough to start eating in this way, they will see the very high price and it is back to the supermarket.

It seems like every film student is making a documentary these days, from the evils of nuclear power, gas fracking, the mortgage crisis, etc.. While some are entertaining, they do not offer any viable solutions. The last documentary I saw that proposed real solutions was ""Death by China"". To the next young documentary maker, remember: anyone can yell fire, how about picking up a hose?",1388102400,3,1678,4.188854489164087

It was late and I didn't watch all of it because I had to get to bed, but I was glad to get to preview it for possibly using it at school in my FACS class. I have heard a lot about this video and several teachers do use it. It is actually quite frightening to think that one company can control the US food supply by controling the seed.

It is so sad that farmers are getting bullied and that Monsanto is so corrupt, it is unbelievable!  I thought we were supposed to have more choices and not forced into eating or doing what we don't chose to.  I am sure we can all try to grow our own food, but realistically most of us will have to go to the supermarket and buy GMO food.

It also generally describes the current dysfunctional food subsidy program which virtually guarantees that too much of the wrong foods and not enough of the right foods are produced and distributed. The current obesity epidemic is a direct result of the imbalance.

They are never treated or seen as animals but more like meat product that is not dead yet but will be soon so who cares. I can still hear the chickens in the chicken house without any light at the beginning of the movie. Yes, I cannot stop hearing their cries, the horror those poor animals must endure in total darkness. How can anyone be so cruel toward animals? We hear and read about people being arrested for ""animal cruelty"" when it involves dogs, cats, etc. Why aren't these corporations and their ""farmers"" being arrested for animal cruelty? Part of me wishes I had not watched this movie. It is so disturbing. I already buy mostly grassfed, free range and organic. But now I will NEVER eat the eggs or flesh of animals raised this way.

Not just for the cruel way the animals we eat are treated but for the health aspects.  Who wants to eat meat full of stress hormones like cortisol and full of steroids and antibiotics??? Not me and definitely not my kids!
They also have a very nice piece about a farmer in the midwest who is farming the old fashioned way.  Animals are treated humanely and slaughtered humanely.

Live animals like cows, chicken, pigs, lobsters, etc. are treated as parts of a machinery to be chopped and processed. Mass production and assembly line techniques adapted from the industrial world when applied to the food industry has its pros and cons. Most poor folks working long hours or with multiple jobs, can't afford or don't have the time to cook their own meals. The fact is, reasonably good quality staple food for the poor and the common man in the USA and Canada is the cheapest in the world based on our per capita income levels. An average lower middle income or below minimum wage earner living in an urban city in North America can have a high protein and high carb content meal for less than $6 (i.e. little less than an hours minimum wage in most states) at a fast food chain. One can buy a whole roasted chicken for $6 and a dozen eggs for $3 at most retail groceries.

I will never buy or knowingly eat any chicken from Foster Farms or any meat from any of the other places that I recall from this documentary.  I am not, nor will become a vegetarian, but I'd prefer to eat animals that lived normal, happy lives in natural surroundings, were treated with kindness and dignity, and ate normal food.

The other thing about the documentary was seeing people working horrible, soul-killing (not to mention often dangerous) jobs, being mistreated as much as the animals, and other people having to scrabble for work and having to work very long hours at low paying jobs so they have neither the time nor money to fix and eat even mildly healthy food.  Their bodies are giving up the battle to stay functional and vital by their 40s, and I wonder how they will live in the next 10 years with no health and no resources or safety net.  I have no leanings towards a socialist society, but this situation is very wrong and I don't know the solution.  I know one thing:  I will never complain about my well paying, normal work hours job with benefits ever again.  I don't like going to work as I have lost interest in what I do and find it boring, but I needed this reminder to realize how really, really good I have it, and stop taking what I have for granted.

3865484,2,B0027BOL4G,"Food comes from gulags for animals. Even plant life does not escape scrutiny.

The thing that I did not expect was the push to tell you that the FDA has no teeth in the matter. It is defiantly a different FDA that I dealt with in the medical device industry; they carried guns and badges.

A lot of the film was tearjerker stories. Deaths and poor people eating while driving. We get to watch animals getting dispatched.

Not sure where they are going with the small section in the center of the film about Wal-Mart going organic. There is a Monsanto police story catching farmers saving seeds; it is sort of a mini McCarthy film.

The rest of the film is an updated version of the Russian film ""Earth"" (1930) where the nasty government made the proletariat use tractors to pull their plows.

Bottom line is everyone has a choice. Exposs only sell films. There is nothing revolutionary to justify wasting the time viewing.

First I cut way, way, way back on sugar (not completely ought though.) I lost about 10 lbs in about 3 weeks. Then I bought a ""Hamilton Beach"" Big Mouth Pro Juicing Machine. I lost 20 lbs the first week doing the detox method (juicing fresh, almost all organic veggies and a little fruit.) I was not hungry, though I still had some cravings for sweets, steak, etc. It is important to know that I never let myself get hungry. I drank the 16 oz juice 3 times a day for 21 days snacking on cut up fresh veggies when I felt the need. My weight loss stalled a little, then slowly started moving again. It has been 6 weeks now and I currently have lost 40 lbs., went from a 38"" waist to a 34."" My shoes are now laced as tight as they will go and are now slip-ons. I feel & look healthier. I have a better attitude now and my doctor took me off most of my meds. He said over time, I may get off them all.

Honestly, you do have to have drive, enthusiasm, and determination. However, you do NOT have to be hungry and want to make sure you are not hungry. Otherwise you trigger a starvation involuntary bodily response to store fat due to the bodily perception of food shortage. This is only one reason why ordinary DIETS DO NOT WORK!

Are you tired of your life as it is? Hungry for dramatic change? GET BUSY! I am NOT sorry I decided to change.

They were dumbfounded. It kept their attention without being ""preachy"". I think kids smell baloney when grown-ups are exaggerating or being overly dramatic, it turns them off. This movie does the opposite. I am an MD with an Anti-Aging and Weight Loss practice, so I recommend the movie to my patients all the time. I live in an area where the grocery stores don't carry grass-fed beef, never mind the butcher shops. This movie inspired me to find sources of good, grass fed meats, and free range chicken, direct from a farm co-op. It shows you the scam behind the labeling in our supermarkets. I believe, as do most doctors in my field, that we are nutritionally depleted and over-fed, not unlike the cows you see in this movie. My patients come in with so many digestive problems, so much inflammation in their own systems, so much stress, so many allergies, they can't lose weight... they all think it's somehow their fault. They believe TV commercials. They believe they can eat like their parents did. This movie shows them that our food supply is nothing like it was when we were kids. It shows the way our centralized government and lobbyists control what we eat in a way that would be impossible to do in places like Europe, where there is no one government, and hence, no real lobbying going on that would affect the entire continent. Perhaps this is the real reason why ""French Women Don't Get Fat"".  I wish we could get schools to show ""Food, Inc."" in their ""Health"" classes. I doubt it would be considered politically correct, but I feel that middle schoolers would benefit much more from watching this in class, than watching their teacher show them how to put a condom on a banana.

Not accurate: portrayal of Monsanto and grains farming. ""Where am I supposed to get my seeds?"" says one farmer. There are plenty of non-Monsanto seed companies. And the whole whining about how only 6 seed reconditioners exist in Indiana? Maybe that's because reconditioning existing seed doesn't result in the bushels/acre that new seed does, and farmers are smarter than that. As for GMO/non-GMO, you would be hard-pressed to find any non-GMO corn or soy anymore in the US, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It has been happening for years by all seed companies.

3865577,5,B0027BOL4G,"This gives a brief but very important and almost never publicized view of the sickening and unconscionable, wasteful,polluting and oversized food industry. What man does to animals,the environment,other people;  enslaved in sickening and dangerous, bloody jobs in slaughter and meat packing;farming where they are exposed to chemicals and toxic heavy metals used by the agricultural industry,or trapped by the cycle of debt and spending in production that is too big to be manageable, proves what a monster man is when man dominates,controls,manipulates,enslaves;brutalizing and destroying the lives of animals,other people,and the environment.

In Food Inc,in the brief scenes where live animals are shown,you see a farmer talking about his animals,who aren't in CAFO's or factory farms,and the chickens who are being slaughtered by being placed,upside down with their heads sticking out, in a cone shaped decapitator,all scream and cry when they're being unmercifully murdered,one after the other. The man seems like he's human and he seems glad his animals aren't in the horrible industrial food chain/slaughter/processing system like most animals slaughtered for food are. Yet he hears and sees them helpless and slaughtered. (I think he was in Farmageddon,another agricultural-practices DVD also). But his idea is more the quality of his food not being so toxic and polluted and unnatural, as the food-products from the mega-operations and unmanageably big producers are;the animals and their lives aren't his topic. They still are slaughtered for food and he pulls the entrails out of a freshly slaughtered chicken as he's speaking. In Food Inc you also hear the cow's voices and see the cold brutality as someone tries to make a sick or lame cow,a 'downer cow' stand up,prodding with an electric cattle prod,shoving with a fork lift. The cow is crying and helpless and in fear. Trying to escape what will only be very evil and cruel and inhuman,when she is finally brutalized and moved,either by force or hoisted,live,by one leg,by a chain which will yank her up till she's dangling,head down and brutalize her. A scene like that is at the beginning of Glass Walls,a 13 minute DVD and youtube video,narrated by Paul McCartney. You don't see the cruel brutality that I know they do to downer cows,in Food Inc.

In Food Inc you see the 'killing floor' at Smithfield slaughterhouse and they mention it by name,then all you see is pig after pig,unconscious or stunned,still and unmoving, coming down a large,stainless steel ramp like a wide,play ground sliding board. Though what you don't see are pigs who are very much conscious,going through the boiling water, screaming and going through the slaughter process and skinning, alive,like happens on a regular basis in every type of slaughter. The stunning doesn't always work. Chickens. Cows. Pigs. Turkeys. Goats. Lambs. Sheep. Nobody cares what they do to animals who are destined to be skinned and ripped apart in slaughter. The animals aren't stunned when they should have been,or the way they should have been,or the animals regain consciousness. But nobody cares and nobody has time to give that tiny human act of not sending a fully conscious animal through the slaughter process. Another animal is coming through to be stunned and ripped into pieces,sliced and skinned,gutted and decapitated,in the nightmare gore of brutality,to stock grocery store meat shelves.  You see illegal immigrants,workers at the slaughterhouse,getting rounded up and taken from their home, by ICE. And you see a man taken to court by Monsanto for ""cleaning his own seeds"";he had to abandon his fight because he ran out of money to pay his legal fees;someone said fighting in the courts is like seeing lady Justice holding the scales and,whoever piles the most money on,wins. And you also see,and hear about common items in grocery stores,and about GMO products and Monsanto. And one part that talks about successful organic
Merchandising.

Our industrial food chain is unnatural and wrong. And so many foods are unhealthy and unnecessary.

Food Inc tells people what I doubt they know. And also tells people something they need to know,and to start thinking about. And to start considering,and to start changing,and to start doing something about.",1379635200,,4287,5.260233918128655

3865579,3,B0027BOL4G,"This documentary contains some important facts about our food production, but unfortunately is comes across as a anti-Monsanto propaganda piece. After watching Food, Inc, I asked two farmers I know well about Monsanto. Both of them thought Monsanto was the best thing for farmers since the tractor. Every farmer I've met since then I also asked about Monsanto and none of them had a negative opinion of Monsanto. So who do I believe? Farmers I know who use Monsanto products? Or people filming a documentary?

No more calls please, we have a winner.

After talking to my farmer friends, I began to research Monsanto some. Generally I found out they were acting like every other big publicly traded corporation. So why do the environmentalists consider Monsanto more evil than Satan? And more evil than, say, Apple or Microsoft or Bank of America or Comcast. I don't know why.

In any event, after talking to my farmer friends, I decided this film was really propaganda and not a documentary. If you strip out the anti-Monsanto part, it does make some excellent points. I recommend you watch this film, but realize the Monsanto parts are half-truths and should be ignored. The parts about animals are spot-on.

We also need to remember that Round Up does not take nutrients out of plants nor does it harm us. Organic is not safer. Things that make our food grow faster take nutrients out of food and harm us. But not pesticides. Consumer Reports said that.",1379462400,,1455,4.808

Watch and learn and become proactive. Tell Monsanto and the food industry that we don't want GMOs in our meat or produce. Know what you are eating.

3865630,5,B0027BOL4G,"Frankly, I was surprised at how professionally and understandingly this film was handled. The truth is that there are two sides to this story: Hungry people demanding cheap food & those who supply our food!
  There are too many people in the world and we are wiping out our natural resources. With this in mind,  there are bound to be ""problems"" in/with a system that is forced to supply massive amounts of food-and then pushed to make it ""cheap"" as well. So this film quite proficiently hits these issues and manages to try to give life to both sides. The slant against corporations is both reasonable and a bit tough. The truth is that our family farmers could no longer feed the world with organic technology. The romantic notion of going back to horses & oxen pulling plows vs. or not using fossil fuels and toxic chemicals dies a bit harder with each new life people choose to bring in to the world.
  There is a section on how the animals are raised before being slaughtered that is quite vivid and rather rough for young people to watch. I found myself at the edge of tears. There is a cruelty involved, furthered along by watching illegal immigrants kicking some of the chickens that get in their way. But then, ""we the people"" are still demanding fast food, fresh food, cheap food...and this is how it is made.
  One issue that came up in the movie that should make freedom lovers grimace, was the part about corporations/corporate lobbyists now passing bills that outlaw filming of such enterprises, encourage corp. lawsuits against individuals who speak out and (in many cases) forcing family farmers out of business/off of their lands by setting them up for mass sales and then pinning them down with large debt and the threat of pulling said business from them if they do not concede.
  Overall, this documentary will not leave you smiling over the state of our food supply, but then again, a little reality goes a long way. And if you live in a city, I question how you would raise your own ""fast food"" beef, poultry & pork-perhaps in a darkened, sound-proofed garage?

It's hard to walk away from GMO products or brands that abuse animals and farmers, but I'm making progress slowly. I'm buying more local stuff from local farms, which helps them (plus is nice to establish a relationship with the farmer instead of buying veggies from the supermarket where you have minimal human contact).

This movie definitely opens your eyes to what you are actually putting into your mouth. We all know that the food companies are crooked and that they have been treating farmers like crap, but to actually physically see it and hear from the farmers themselves is a whole different ballgame.
There is a part in this movie where they are showing you the inside of a cow's stomach, and I just wanted to throw up. And the way that the chickens are raised and how they don't even have the strength to take five steps was just appalling. I am just like everyone else, I put too much trust into food and I need to start paying more attention to what I am actually eating. This film will have you spending a lot more time at the grocery store examining your food, which is a good thing.

The documentary seeks to trace where the food in the grocery stores in America comes from (there's little to no representation of food internationally - except when food production in USA impacts the world.).

After setting out with this goal, it locks onto the key ingredients in the food (and what appears to be variety), and how they are produced - thus farms are shown (and therefore corn and soybean production - from seed to harvest), and meat production (beef, chicken, pork - from growth to slaughter).

3865662,5,B0027BOL4G,"This is one of the few movies in theater out there that was not designed to be entertaining. No, it was designed to be informative, and I am hecka glad it was made. This movie is important. It may even lead to major changes in the food industry.
Look at it this way. It's real simple. Right now, companies hold the most power in America, greater even than the government's in some places. But unlike the government, the company's goal is not to protect the people. No, the goal of the company is one word: profit. And when that ends up doing the opposite of protecting the people, ends up doing widespread and massive harm, the company doesn't care as long as it can get away with it. Because of this, companies need to be watched like a hawk in order to be safe. There are two groups that can watch the companies and keep them in line: the government, and the public. But with all the power that companies hold, they can influence the government to look the other way when it comes to everything that's wrong with the food industry. They can even get the government to help them, by creating subsidies to keep the foods that are the most harmful to us (corn, mostly) cheap, and by defending the unsanitary, harmful, and downright disgusting practices of the food industry in the court and in Congress. So since the government is obviously unhelpful in this matter, the only ones who can help the people are themselves. However, until recent events, the public was completely blind to what was really happening to the food they ate. Even with news reports of massive salmonella and e. coli outbreaks, even with diabetes and obesity on the rise, nobody seemed to bat an eye. But with the rise of books like The Omnivore's Dilemma, and movies such as this, the public is finally starting to realize the truth of the food industry. At last, major revamps are coming the way of the food industry. Just by watching this movie, you are doing your part to help. One thing's for sure: I NEVER want to eat another hamburger.

As a side note, the food industry is only one of many. ALL companies are motivated by profit, most, by nothing but it. Just look around your house. 99% of what you see was manufactured by a company. Perhaps it's time that we start to take a better look at what's really happening in America--not just in the food industry.",1372291200,,2339,4.503529411764706

We were even amazed at the governments and the politicians who are VERY involved in this huge business industry of our country! Many people involved with/working for Monsanto, also work in the white house as they decide how marketing the processed food continues! This is really unbelievable that our food industry is not about making us feel better at all. It is about Making Money using chemicals & preservatives & GMO to get the attention of our taste buds! The administration of President Bush, Clinton & probably Obama is very unfortunate as they are all ""IN"" on promoting the manufacturing of continued processed foods, hormone induced & mistreated animals, and really how disgusting all of this really is.

Although I am not sure that was the point of the film, it was useful in discouraging meat intake, (especially considering studies showing vegetarians live longer).  Although I am not to that point yet, this film does make me look more carefully at my future food choices which is not something I can say about most films. It is likely after viewing this that I will cut back even more on meat intake and I will definitely buy more organic products. Although some big food processors declined to be interviewed, the filmmakers were fair in giving WalMart credit for the organic purchases they have made, showing they were willing to give positive reinforcement to big businesses making an effort to be more environmentally conscious. Unfortunately, most of the big meat processors don't fall in this category. I have to say I have not eaten chicken since watching this film although conditions in California have improved for the birds. The film is depressing but it also points out that consumers have the ultimate choice in deciding what to eat.

3865677,5,B0027BOL4G,"I got this a few years ago when the movie was making the rounds at the theaters and I missed it there. I just realized I hadn't reviewed it, and thought it might be of value. I will say in all honesty that if you are a die-hard cow/chicken/pig eater with a, ""ain't nobody gonna tell me different!"" mindset, no offense but just move on. I say that because you won't like what you see if you sit through this movie. It will disturb you, perhaps gross you out, and you will likely think that you wasted your money. But, if you are having doubts and concerns about what the big industrial food production machine is dumping down your gullet... if your health is suffering for no apparent reason and your weight is out of control, watch this, preferably more than once, and then tell me you're not affected. This movie does not necessarily advocate a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle, but it does expose many of the hazards and--to be blunt--outright atrocities committed on other living things in the name of efficiency and price point and 'consumer demand'. Personally, it changed the way I eat, the way I view food and decide what to put in my mouth. It changed where I go out to eat and what I order when I get there. The movie motivated me to drop 30 pounds and generally focus on my health and who I give my money to. And it genuinely scared me when I learned the scale and tactics used by those who would prefer that I maintain the status quo and keep my mouth shut.

The average person must see this to learn what goes on in the food chain before meals hit their table. Everything they see here will surely affect how they buy and consume food from that moment on. This was produced in 2008 before Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) gained momentum in the industry. I hope they bring out another look at the food industry with GMO's now threatening our health. The other thing I hope the producers take on is how American food, once the worlds standard for nutrition, is now banned in many countries because of unhealthy additives, preservatives and chemicals the rest of the developed world banned from their food.

Although, some things were not mentioned, the United States Government is still paying farmers not to grow food, when there is so much starvation in this earth. And do not let me get started on this Mosanto seed fiasco. Down the road, genetically engineered anything will prove to be a curse. Man always corrupts when he tries to play God. Back in the late fifties, all of our grown crops were good. There was no such thing as organic. Milk only had 3 days code for instance. Then some shrewd mind got to thinking, ""lets pull all the good stuff off the shelves, and all the good ingredients out of the food, hide it for awhile, start pumping the consumer with a bunch of fluff, put it in a nice package, cut the weight down, raise the prices twice a year, make a handsome profit, then re-introduce the good stuff back into the mainstream, call it organic  and charge triple for that!""

3865777,5,B0027BOL4G,"I heard of ""Food, Inc."" five years ago when Michael Pollan was on Oprah.  I started eating more organic just from the information shown on the program.  Now, five years later, I have now recently transitioned my diet to a vegan diet.  I've been eating a whole-food plant-based diet for the last 3 months and feel so much healthier. I have chosen to eat this way primarily for health reasons, but also out of fear of GMO's.  Knowing that our farm animals are fed a diet rich of GMO corn and we are what we eat, I have become concerned of what eating animals fed a GMO diet will have on our health.

 As I was browsing the health documentaries on Amazon, I stumbled across this DVD.  I remembered seeing it on Oprah and wondered why I had never bought it.  I think a few negative reviews had turned me away.  I'm glad I finally made the decision to purchase it and watch it.  The film reinforced my belief about food.  Food should be natural, real, the way our grandparents and ancestors ate.  Without chemicals, and genetic modifications.  This film gave me another reason to eat an organic plant-based diet, your risk of getting E-coli is greatly decreased.  The movie really made me think.  Most of us take for granted how important food is to us.  We all know we need it for life, but most of us never think about what we are actually eating and how eating something can effect our health for years to come.  Or even cause death in a few days.  I don't want to feed my kids burgers unless it's one I made at home using grass-fed meat. I'm not paranoid, just aware and cautious and this film gave me reason to be.

In summary, I enjoyed it.  I'm going to share it with my friends and family.  It was well-made and very informative.  It was entertaining.  I think it's important for everyone to know what America's food industry is really doing.  I was very happy to see them make many mentions of Monsanto, a company I already didn't trust.  You do have a choice.  You choose what you eat 3 times a day. Buy Local. Buy Organic. It's that simple.",1369353600,,2046,4.360742705570292

3865873,5,B0027BOL4G,"This movie really opened my to why I had suspected food in USA is poisonous to consumers. I have often wondered why it is dangerous to feed honey to babies in USA, yet ever where else around the world, babies eat raw honey and honey comb. Reason being the food in USA is poisoned by the manufacturers in a game to cause consumers ill-health and cause them to be dependent on drugs for solutions to eating poisoned foods.

Once in 1997 a friend of mine came to visit USA. On a trip to Walmart, she observed to women standing side by side blocking the aisle; these women were approximately 3 feet wide. We had to go the next aisle in order go around them. When asked what caused them to be this large, I replied, ""processed foods in USA are poisonous and unhealthy for human consumption"". The same can be said regarding feeding domestic animals human food. Human food in USA is the number one cause of cancers and tumors and untimely death of pets. If the food is not good for the pets why eat it? It is only in USA that food is bad for pets. All over the world, what people eat, their pets eat.

Definitely Food Inc gives the viewer an informed decision on choice of food products. Unfortunately, many are addicted to the ""natural flavor"" and ""artificial flavor"" found in most foods, and with their bellies overpowering their will, many will eat their way to disease and death.

I recommend this movie for all audiences. My advise: watch the movie, consider your health, change your diet, read the Bible and get right with God; live better, eat smarter. For those that argue against the Bible dietary laws; has not following the Bible's laws helped anyone who is unhealthy? Think about it.",1366761600,,1688,4.509803921568627

I've always been against the subsidization of corn and soybeans, but I had no idea how much the large corporations are embedded into our government. It's sickening, but for sure worth knowing.

Although I knew most of the info presented in the movie and generally eat organic and avoid processed sugar, flour, etc., transitioning my family to my eating habits has been a slow evolution.  This movie revved things up a bit and I'm pleased to say that after watching it, my son has become outraged at McDonald's and Tyson's -- even sneered at the fact that KFC advertises the fact that they use Tyson's, as though it were a good thing.  I definitely recommend it for families who want to make their kids more aware of what is going on with our food supply.

I would have liked to have seen some details about some positives they see the market and what they think could change to fix the problems that exist.  Seems like subsidized corn is a huge issue and causes lots of the mess they talk about in the film but why did that occur (historically) and what keeps it going today?  That's not really mentioned in the film and I would have liked to see more of that.  Overall, reminds me of a modern day 'The Jungle' and hopefully it has the same impact to change regulation and create a better food industry with less concern about pleasing the companies so they get a larger profit.",1363564800,,735,4.382352941176471

I was curious whether this would be a propaganda type movie. Afterwards, my belief has been proven to be correct. In just my lifetime the food we eat has gone through a change that our bodies are not able to deal with. It makes me ill to think that its our government and a few conglomerate companies that just don't care about American's health. Yea I know, its all about making more money. I applaud the few that would put their livelihood on the line to get the truth out and pray that our methods in growing and producing food will go back to the way it was done over 50 years ago. Thanks for the education and now at least I can modify the way I eat so that it won't have such a terrible effect on my body. I will share this with family and friends.

Im now shopping locally, searching out organic farmers, Im researching Monsanto and I am paying more attention to the ethical treatment of animals. I have to say, especially to someone like me in a very small town who does not have access to a large supply of organic foods, this subject matter can be very depressing. It seems as though people are shocked and then move on and forget about being angry. It leaves you feeling like you need to do something, but you cant really do enough all at the same time.

They ought to be shut down or forced to send cows out to pasture. They are directly responsible for the many deaths from ecoli in this country. FDA inspected meat NO MORE. Seems like 20 or 30 years ago, I would regularly see a blue inspection stamp on meat. I haven't seen one of those in years. Now, I know why. Only a fraction of commercial meat is inspected. I knew in Canada 30 years ago not to eat U.S. meat because their standards are so poor. I've been in the U.S. for around 20 years. Recent trips to Vancouver and Toronto convince me that Canada still has high standards versus U.S. very low standards. This documentary proves it.

3866121,2,B0027BOL4G,"The polemical nature of the film sometimes works to the disadvantage of its aims, cinematically and, also dialectically, as there is a whole digression on the finding of E. coli in certain foods which is simply not an issue that has to do with the production of food organically or not, but on the subsequent handling of it, for such can easily occur in organic products, as well as genetically engineered or factory farmed. That the film makes hay of this point, and uses the death of a child to make it, is a bit disingenuous, but the film also deals with the lax regulations that make such outbreaks inevitable, and the outfall from the death, which includes industry attempts to defeat the law, year after year, and disallow government inspections of processing plants (ah, the joys of deregulation!). Contrapuntally, the film also shows a farmer who raises his chickens in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and slaughters them humanely, and in the open air, only to get slapped by federal authorities with claims that his chickens are unsanitary, whereas processed chickens are dipped in chemical baths- a classic case of the insanity that often accompanies the mix of government and big business into any area, even as the government's inspection of such businesses has decreased by over 80% in the last four decades. The film also details Monsanto's CIA-like attempts to intimidate and extort small farmers into a feudal serfdom via their legal department's patent infringement harassment, as well as `food libel laws,' and the gaming of the system by paying off legislators in many countries to write laws favorable to them.
  That stated, Food, Inc. is a classic mixed bag- too long on Left Wing nostra when it should have concentrated on what it did best- feature raw information which is undeniable.",1359676800,,1811,4.953947368421052

The ""typical"" American family portrayed in the movie, reminded me of my own. In the sense that the fast food is cheap. However I'm against them saying vegetables are expensive.

3866128,3,B0027BOL4G,"I was interested in this documentary ""Food, Inc."" not because of accolades heaped on the movie - it was also Oscar nominated - but because of the overwhelming response from the viewers. Nearly 1,000 reviews on Amazon site! Now that I watched Robert Kenner's documentary film and I think I was pretty disappointed with the film for the following two reasons.

Narrated by two famous authors Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser, the film offers inside view into the American food industry that is often shocking, but I think ""Food, Inc."" is trying to bite off more than it can chew. Food poisoning cases alone, especially those caused by E. coli O 157 (often deadly for children), deserve more time.

Another problem I found with the film is something related to most recently made documentaries: tendency for dramatization, or the usual ""good-guy vs. bad-guy"" conflict. We are asked to take one side of the argument, which is easy to do, but that doesn't make us really think about the issue that could be more complicated and messy than some of the film's interviewees suggest.

I was not impressed with ""Food, Inc."" probably because I have seen Nikolaus Geyrhalter's ""Our Daily Bread"" first. The film does not tell: it just shows. It is slow and some might find it boring, but to me its fascinating visuals are more convincing.",1358899200,,1326,4.832599118942731

3866136,5,B0027BOL4G,"It isn't an over exaggeration to call Food, Inc. one of the most powerful and timely documentaries ever filmed. What is more important to life than health, and what more important factor is there to health than the food that we put into our bodies? This documentary examines what has become of the streamlined food industry that has resulted in a very small number of companies and distributors controlling the majority of the food eaten by consumers. In fact, Food, Inc. blisteringly exposes the fact that what looks like variety on the shelves of supermarkets is just an illusion for the consumer.

One of the more incredible takeaways from the film is the explanation of how much weight the purchasing power of a company like McDonald's holds. If McDonald's is the number one purchaser of beef and potatoes in the nation, and they want something changed in farming, fertilizing or the feeding of cows, what do you think is going to happen? At the end of the day, you might not be eating McDonald's fries, but chances are you're eating potatoes cultivated according to McDonald's specifications. Another problematic take-away is the understanding that the skewed nature of our agricultural system (both in business and politics) makes it much harder for impoverished individuals to eat healthy instead of resorting to the dollar menu.

Food, Inc. covers the entire spectrum of agriculture, including the aforementioned streamlining of the food industry, the ill-advised use of corn to feed cows that weren't meant to digest such food, the confrontational business tactics of GMO companies like Monsanto, and all of the consequences to our health - both physical and economic. As an alternative, Food, Inc. looks into the organic food industry and the more sustainable farming practices of those involved, such as Polyface Farm in Virginia. Despite all the current issues with our agricultural industries, informed consumers are starting to make decisions about their eating habits that are forcing companies such as Walmart to start carrying more and more organic foods. Food, Inc. encourages us to stay informed, and tells us that we have a choice in this matter by voting three times a day with the decision of which foods to eat: Buy organic; Buy local.",1358121600,,2258,5.067204301075269

The growth of our nation...in both individual size and weight and gross national product is a direct impact of this centralization of the farming processes.  The film's producers note that in all their investigations, those who were investigated were invited to present their views and declined.  I'll give away the ending: think about alternatives within your control to minimize the effects of food production system that may be taking us in the wrong direction.

I tell you what, this is real life that scientist are playing with...our lives. After seeing Food, Inc all I could think about was that up until my 29th year in life I had no problem drinking milk and then all of sudden while in Kosovo I sat down to enjoy a nice cool glass of milk with my chocolate chip cookie. By the time I had finished eating and started making my way outside to my domicile I grew increasingly ill, I vomited so hard that I hurdled over in convulsions and my sides were caving in. By the time I reached the medical facility I had spots all over face and my eye had a contusion.  I was told that I was allergic to milk. WHAT! That was in September 2000. After that sometimes eating scrambled eggs made me puke, while sitting at the table I'd have to run to the toilet. I was angry, I couldn't understand what had happen to me concerning diary. I switched to Soy milk and soy products; stopped even eating my beloved eggs and less bread. Since that time, I am now diagnosed as vitamin D deficient (2011), my level of vit D is 14 the normal range is 32 or so, which is strange b/c I ate my share of vegetables. Since seeing this documentary and others like it I am drinking and eating more organic Non-GMO products. I even drink milk...NON-GMO MILK and I'm eating eggs again (No added Hormones, No Antibotics, Cage Free and Non-GMO) along with other foods that I had to stop eating b/c I was feeling sick to my stomach, sluggish and over bloated. I feel like my life has been saved. Thanks be to God.  I am willing to pay more for organically non modified food...natural food, in order to be healthy. They are even crossing fish DNA in our tomatoes in order to enable them to withstand cold winter frost (youtube). WTH!
I think it's an all out shame that food grown and sown naturally is costing us more at the grocer, when it should be the other way around. When I see something that reads FDA approved I want to scream in disgust. When I see something with the little green butterfly or/and Non-GMO on it I feel so relieved and on the inside I exhale and thank God. We can't all grow our own vegetables and raise livestock so for heaven's sake thank God for the organizations that are for the people not only for the dollars.

3866174,1,B0027BOL4G,"Food, Inc. (Robert Kenner, 2008)

You know, I really thought that Michael Moore was going to be the absolute worst filmmaker I could ever be exposed to, a kind of halfwit court jester who diesn't realize he stopped being funny long ago, if indeed he ever was.  Unfortunately, Moore's baffling popularity has spawned imitators who don't seem to have glommed onto the fact that Moore at least did have a sense of humor, however questionable. Enter TV documentarian Robert Kenner, turning in his first big-screen feature, a ridiculous piece of one-sided propaganda that barely warrants the term ""documentary"", and I say this as someone who entrely agrees with all but two of the points being made here (more on that later).

Plot: factory farming is bad, mmmkay? And the evil megacorps who practice it are bent on taking over the world, no matter the cost in human and animal misery, muhahahahahahahahahaaaa!

Yes, I'm serious. The main difference between Monsanto and Gru (the main character in the delightful animated film Despicable Me) is that Gru eventually grows a heart. But I guaran-damn-tee you, if Robert Kenner could have found a way to work in some sort of unsubstantiated allegation that Monsanto, like Gru, had hatched an attempt to steal the moon, he'd have thrown it in here. This is a guy with a chip in his shoulder, a very big one. He's got a life-sized grudge against big corporations, whether they be restaurant chains (McDonald's, of course, is singled out), big-box stores (while the film provides a pretty comprehensive list, of course you know he's specifically going after Wal-Mart), factory farmers (Monsanto, blah blah blah) and their lobbyists, and the government, who are needless to say puppets dancing to the megacorps' tune. And like I said at the top of the hour, you know what? I agree with him about most of this. I'm as anti-factory-farm and pro-locavore as the next guy. And I teared up at Keith Kowalcyk's story just like pretty much everyone else who watched this movie--though I wonder if Barbara Kowalcyk understood the terrible irony of her statement that she doesn't want pity, she just wants people to listen, when half the movie that's just gone by is all about inciting people to pity in order to soften them up for Kenner ramming his message into the frontal lobes of his viewers with all the subtlety of a captive bolt pistol (google that if you don't know what it is, but here's two hints: it was Javier Bardem's character's favorite murder weapon in No Country for Old Man, and it is very germane to this discussion).

As for those two places where Kenner got it horribly, horribly wrong, as a side discussion: first off, the long stream of text at the end of the film, which is put there just in case you, the viewer, are too stupid to have gotten all the bullet points while, you know, actually watching the movie, starts off with an exhortation to buy organic. This despite having shown us a scene less than twenty minutes before of the CEO of Stonyfield Farms ushering a rep from a prospective buyer around an organic foods fest, pointing out all of the companies represented there that are now parts of megacorps. (""Kashi is Kellogg's?"" ""Yes."" ""I didn't know that."") They seem to be taking an ""any regulation is better than no regulation"" tack in making this exhortation, as so many people do (you will see ""buy organic and only organic!"" advice in at least half the diet books published in the past ten years), but the simple truth of the matter is that the guidelines for a product being certified organic by the American government are not only lax, but constantly shifting. The movie opens with a brief discussion of how the American public is misled by companies having images of farmers and red barns and all that malarkey on their products... and then at the end of the movie the filmmakers are allowing themselves to be misled by that damn-close-to-meaningless ""certified organic"" label in exactly the same way, and because they're offering themselves up as skeptics, they're duping you into the same boat. Take a different piece of advice from that text stream: buy local, instead (and while you're at it, watch the vastly superior locavore documentary that came out soon after this, Ingredients.)

Second: in yet another piece of knee-jerk-reaction-dom, and one that has very quickly become almost as prevalent as the ""buy organic!"" scam, these guys are of course anti-GMO. And that is a much, much, much longer discussion than the one above, one that we don't really have time for here, but I have commented on it at length in other reviews (most explicitly in my review of Vegan Cooking for Dummies, q.v.). To lay it out as briefly as possible, it's ridiculous, and arbitrary, to attack GMO and embrace ""certified organic"" when they both have exactly the same amount of research done on them vis-a-vis risks and benefits of consumption. It shows a kind of selective blindness that should raise red flags in your head--though with this documentary, those flags should already be up and waving long before you get to the GMO section.

I think the film industry needs to adopt the same standards the book industry did a decade or so ago, when the rise of the memoir caused book publishers to create an entirely separate category that is now known as ""creative nonfiction"" to distinguish things that are actually true from things that are seen through rose-colored, jaundice-colored, or psychedelia-colored lenses a la Augusten Burroughs/James Frey/Elie Wiesel/etc. Food, Inc. falls firmly into whatever category they would decide to create; it is nonfiction, but it is so one-sided that you can't help but wonder how much the filmmakers massaged the data, how many editorial tricks were used on the footage, how many interviews were left on the cutting-room floor in order to make sure that anything that might have made this film balanced was excised. It's offensive--and again, I say this as someone who agrees with almost every premise presented here. Actually, now that I think about it, the fact that I agree with them makes it even worse.

No matter what, it's messy, so I don't get very worried about feed lots and slaughter houses.  With the amount of killing that's going on each day, it's a surprise to me there aren't more contaminations.  Oh yeah, Having Eric dress in farmers attire, struck me as disingenuous.

I almost stopped watching when it began to rant about treating workers better and how industrialization animal husbandry was bad.

The part about Monsanto, bugs me.  How much?  Will it change my diet? no.  Do I hate the concept of monopoly?  You bet.

This very well-done and well-documented serious documentary will probably not turn any reasonable person into a vegan overnight, but it will probably encourage him/her to begin buying only organic things and shop at the farmer's market where the meat is made in a decent way... They show how the meat industry have come from one of the best jobs one could possibly dream to have in the US during the forties to an industry where 4 companies control 80% of the meat market and where they have agreement with the police so they would not arrest more than 15 illegal workers a night so it would not disrupt the ""assembly line""... They show that this job have become so dangerous nobody want to do it anymore; the giant slaughterhouse located in the city of Tar Heel, who is one of the poorest city in the US, have to bus in workers from a 100 miles radius... They also underline the problem of genetically-engineered food; those who don't care about that kind of food will learn that the company Monsanto who produce the genetically-modified seeds have private investigators and are prosecuting farmers if their fields are ""contaminated"" with patented Monsanto seeds; the farmers then have to prove in a court of law that they didn't plant these seed intentionally, that they're present only because all their neighbors have some... It should be noted that the company Wal-Mart among others is one of the very very few who accepted to collaborate to the making of this documentary. At the end they show there's hope for the future since organic food is one of the fastest-growing area in the USA currently; as they say ""you can vote to change the situation; three times a day""...

It makes you aware of where your food is coming from and what they do to it before you get it.  It was also good to see and hear about the farmers who are still trying to treat their chickens and cattle well including what they feed them. If we hadn't seen it with our own eyes through this movie, we wouldn't have believe how cruel these animals are treated.  We are not trying to be vegetarians but we will be more careful what we buy.  We will only buy pasture raised chickens and cattle instead of what the most of the supermarkets are selling.  The animals are not only treated better...they are being fed what they are suppose to eat and not that GMO cornmeal. What they eat is what goes in our bodies. We all need to know what we are eating.

There is so much more to be learned by watching ""Food, Inc."" ... so much more than I ever imagined was happening in the food industry. Personally, as a former fan of chicken, watching the part focusing on that particular industry was extremely disturbing.  Images and sounds that are hauntingly unforgettable.

I recomend that everyone see this movie and demand a better, safer product from the industry leaders.

This film highlights the corrupt practices of major food companies, including Tyson and Monsanto. Viewers get an insight into animal cruelty, GMOs, and the exploitation of farmers. To my surprise, it didn't advocate veganism, but I think that makes it more appealing to a larger audience. If you watch this movie, you won't be coerced by propaganda. You will simply be given information about what you pay for. This movie is excellent and even my boyfriend, who does not care about eating healthy, loved it.

3866234,2,B0027BOL4G,"I agree that most of what is in this film needs to be said.  However, it needs to be said in a different manner.  The film ignores many of the realities of mass farming.  For example, there is a cattle farmer in the film who is proud that he produces organic meat but then states that he doesn't care how far people have to travel to get it.  In essence, he ignores that cattle production (and most other food production) is done in the Plain states for cost and/or climate reasons.  Raising the amount of cattle in the northeast (and other populated areas) where land is expensive and more densely populated, is most likely not a reality.  While I'd like to be proven otherwise, I was hoping the documentary would be more comprehensive on this obvious point.

Additionally, there are many leaps of faith in the film that you would have if you were to accept it at face value.  For example, much of the narrative of the film relies on the filmmaker himself reciting facts without referencing any source(s).  Or, as another example, the mother who tragically lost her son to E. Coli refers to two other recent deaths without citing a source of the illnesse.  Outbreaks of E. Coli have been linked to a number of sources, although the film suggests it is mainly the cause of runoff from cattle.  This makes the film seem very impartial and opens it up to much criticism.  I really wanted the film to support the views I already had, but all I could think of is how other people would view this film as a flimsy attack.",1347321600,4,1516,4.452898550724638

I'm vegan and choose organic over non when possible... even household products, I will buy those which are more environmentally friendly.  I am one person, but if we all did the same, we would have a huge impact, as the filmmaker suggests.

Unfortunately, after watching this documentary, and the brilliant use of both facts and parallels to the tabacco industry of the 1960's and 1970's, I have to say that I am absolutely disgusted and disappointed.  Not in the Cargills and Monsantos.  I am just cynical enough to expect that behavior. Business tends to be ethically neutral at best.  I am most disappoined and disgusted at our lawmakers and government agencies that are tasked to counterbalance this ethically agnostic behavior with a genuine protective and benevolent interest for the public they were hired or elected to protect and serve. If government is truly abdicating its role as the protector of the citizens of this country, and allows monopolies like the Monsanto soybean seed monopoly to perpetuate, we are better off not paing the taxes to support this continuing behavior.

After watching, I am both saddened by the state of the food we eat and the condition of the institutions responsible for our safety.

Hmmm, to be shamed by the elite because of where you get your food, or even which food to eat is almost like a nightmarish sci-fi movie.  Pollan sure goes out of his way shame the lower-class laborers by telling them they are not eating the right foods.

3866259,3,B0027BOL4G,"There are a lot of negative feelings I'm sure viewers associate with watching ""Food Inc."" I personally was left with feelings of impotence and hopelessness.
The final message, as so many documentaries are won't to do, states that ""you"" the consumer has the final say and the power to change the market. While this is of course true in theory and in essence, it does not always play out that way. I am more than likely to simply buy the cheapest available version of any product I desire or need. I want my grocery list to feed me for the longest time for the least amount of money, and that is that.
As a young person with a small amount of money at my disposal, that is my policy. It is tough to imagine so many other Americans who also only have a small amount of disposable income doing anything other than buying the cheapest product available.
This is not to say most Americans equipped with the knowledge supplied by the film wouldn't try and buy organically farmed products, it just means that most will not when it comes to saving money and feeding their families.
""Food Inc."" is extremely moving. But I can't say there is much I am willing to do to change the market given my current status. If I had more disposable income, as my parents do, I would certainly buy organically, and I believe most other concerned Americans would. If the government subsidized organic produce instead of protecting corporations like Mansanto, this would all be so much different.

It shows how meat is processed, critical conditions in which animals are kept in big farms, and how much farmers are paid.

3866267,5,B0027BOL4G,"Late in the table coming to this film but as an organic eater and grower, I felt I needed to see it. It was horrifying to see how much control lies in so few hands of our food supply. Particularly appalling is that Monsanto make criminals out of innocent people who choose to grow their own seeds (and presumably organic farmers too).

Easy to see how the poor are disadvantaged in this situation. With the food supply being so grotesquely altered, and then subsidised, is it any wonder that illnesses like diabetes are going through the roof.

A wholesome reminder on a personal level to adhere to a healthy, organic (when one can afford it) diet, and to always take a sceptical view of the authorities.

Wholly endorse the sentiments at the end and would encourage everyone to take responsibility for what they put in their mouths, demand organic and demand that the government, the FDA and the multinationals like Monsanto GET OUT OF OUR KITCHEN.",1339286400,,949,4.704819277108434

The small American farmer is under attack as well. While I admit I'm a vegetarian and so may be biased, I'm vowing to buy more organic whenever I can.

3866272,5,B0027BOL4G,"Everyone should see Food Inc. It is inspiring, informative, instructive, and hopeful. It gives you tools and information about what people can do to get involved and make changes in their own lives and possibly become activists for changes in the United States Food Industry. If you are looking at your plate and you don't care where your food came from out of fear, this is your movie. My husband and I overhauled our whole diet because of this movie. We buy all our meat from a local farm that delivers to our city's farmers market and we joined a vegetable and fruit co-op. We pay a yearly fee and pick-up our share of local farm organic, not genetically engineered produce every other week. We don't eat any GMO corn, GMO soybean/soybean oil products, GMO SugarBeets,GMO eggplant, or GE franken-fish salmon!
The only topic I was seriously disappointed that FOOD Inc. did not expose was the factory farming dairy industry, so I will touch on it. In this bazarre and age old practice, cows are abusively artificially inseminated, to keep them perpetually pregnant, so that they can produce milk and milk by-products {yogurt, cheese, butter, ice cream} and the by-product of the cruel dairy industry is the bull dairy calf who has no economic value to the farmer. [Nope, I am not VEGAN] They are pulled from the mother cow at birth and this unweaned animal is sold for ""bob veal"", ""pink veal"" or ""white veal"".  Cows are like women. They can only produce milk if they are giving birth. Does that sound organic to you? If you enjoy dairy, look out for the leukemia virus, paratuberculosis, Salmonella, E. Coli, staphylococcal infections, juvenile diabetes, pus & blood. If you want to take your chance on all of that stuff, how about Monsanto's Bovine Growth Hormone that the FDA claims is safe for human consumption. Canada and Europe don't agree and they will not allow USA dairy products to be exported to thier countries. Doesn't this sound like our FDA, big business, and advertisers to promote a product to you like ""milk it does a body good"" when in all actuality this most bizarre practice is disease ridden and detimental to your health? I invite you to google it.",1337385600,3,2172,4.746031746031746

Could someone please tell me why we, or someone, cannot sue Monsanto for trespass or herbal rape, for their products contaminating things we want and try to grow on our own property without their interference, organic or not?  Frankly, if they ever remotely *dream* of coming after me for growing real food, the way it is meant to be grown, I'll slam them with such a return.  They deserve no better.  I DON'T want their ills in MY food.  If their garbage trespasses here, they're in for it.  I certainly don't want it here, and it is their responsibility for keeping it from crossing property lines.  Serious.

Or are they so omnipotent that such distinctions don't matter?

Piff.  Right now I'm just a backyard gardener, with too much shade to count (though I do what I can), but watching this film, I'd ANGRY and not going stand aside when truth counts more.

3866276,2,B0027BOL4G,"Understood, the movie documents super big food corps, and I'm in agreement that food manufacturing becoming huge business is  not good for the consumer or the animal food sources themselves.  In fact, ""pretty-ing"" up and fattening up our food sources has consequences that reaches us at the cellular level and can cause health problems.  Not to mention tampering with seeds has created a world where seeds must one day become less varied and must ultimately be bought rather than gathered, and that's scary in the biblical sense.

That said, the average city folk that watches this may get the impression that all dairies, all ranches, all chicken farms etc treat their animals inhumanely, that all animal farms are corrupt.  The average busy person is not going to meditate on the fact that this may be a select few companies or that it's big business. In fact, are all food corps this corrupt?  I really don't know, b/c I don't see w/ my naked eye whether there are corp farms that do run ethically.  But I do know that coming from a farming town where dairies are a big business  here, that these dairies and their cows are in plain sight.  I drive by them daily, I see them daily.  Heck, I can just stop my car and walk up to the fence if I wanted to.  I talk w/ the dairyman, I've spoken w/ chicken farmers, I've seen their chickens, our kids go on fieldtrips to these farms and get educated.  And what I see are very clean cows, clean dirt, clean food, and farmers that care very much about their investments.  I've NEVER seen a sick or obese cow wandering around, they are taken care of immediately, b/c they're valuable to the farmers.  Each cow cost money, and healthy cows make money.

Please keep your mind open and realize that is film is not granite and not total reality.  It's one filmmaker's perpective.  Just b/c it's on film doesn't mean it applies to the vast majority of farms.",1333497600,4,1897,4.548672566371682

Where your food comes from and why you should care
What the animals go through
What it can do to your body
How it's hurting the farmers
Who is profiting from it all.

It's very multidimensional. Rather than just focusing on how certain food is bad for you, but it also focuses on how it got there, and who is suffering.

Long story short: it will send you to the farmer's market and organic section every time. It's a shame that many people can't afford the extra cost involved with doing so.

A movie that will knock you off your foundation and change the way you eat.",1332633600,2,624,4.3076923076923075
3866279,4,B0027BOL4G,"I've always liked knowing where my food came from.  Even if it does give that creature a face, I think it makes me appreciate everything more. That being said, life happens and I find myself shopping at the regular supermarket more and more due to finances and time constraints.  And I've gotten away from purchasing my food from local sources.  Watching this movie reminded me of just why I adopted those better practices in the first place, and its time to start getting back to doing so.

There are several parts to this movie involving the food industry, but they all have a prevalent message.  And indeed, the first couple words of the documentary kind of sum it all up with expressing how people have changed what they eat more in the past 50 years than they did in the 10,000 years before then.  And really everything is focused on Corporate farming and how much it has changed the family farm.  They explore the way animals are butchered, to how they are kept, to even how seeds are grown and the controversy behind seed saving.  As a warning, when the animals are butchered it is directly shown, as is a lot of other hard images regarding animals and how they are processed.  If you have a weak stomach, or sensitive disposition, I'm not sure you could handle this film.

There are several interviewees in the film, from farmers that grow their products organically, to those who take place in factory farming, to a woman who lost her child after he ate contaminated meat.  Her story is actually the one that really sticks with you in this movie.  Because nothing really happened after her son died to prevent future things from happening.  But she keeps fighting for government officials to pass ""Kevin's Law"".  A law that will give the USDA the power to shut down factories if they fail safety and health standards too many times.  It should be noted that all the major food corporations were offered to be interviewed and offered rebuttals in this film, and all declined to be interviewed or even to talk to the filmmakers.

But the interviews with everyone else are just as informative.  I especially liked the farmer that did things low scale and slaughtered his animals outside, himself, and knew exactly how he was raising his food.  And his cows got to eat grass, so I imagine they were pretty happy cows.  With all the talk about ""pink slime"" lately too its made me want to buy a freezer and just go out and purchase a side of beef and process it myself.  Which really I should, it would make me appreciate the work behind that burger I grill.  The movie actually did get into a little about hamburger meat is made and processed putting a visual to the information out there available in print.

There is some political discussion in this documentary.  But nothing specifically pulling out a certain party and putting it under the microscope.  It more goes for certain individuals and where they worked before getting government jobs.  It also explores what effect big corporations and lobbyists have on food laws too.  So if politics is a topic that gets you riled up, I'm not sure if this would be a good fit for a movie for you.  But honestly, I do think people should get riled up about their food.  Its what we survive on and we should be putting the best into our bodies, and we should be making those decisions intelligently.

On a separate note the cinematography in this movie is very good.  I liked the effects they had and the way they shot the interviews and showed the footage they had gathered.  It was very professionaly done.  The music on the other hand was less than stellar.  It reminded me of a funeral parlor and while it fit the dreary tone of the whole documentary, I would have preferred there be no music at all.  It just took away from their message because it was too dramatic.

Very informative. although it may turn you to vegetarianism for a few days after eating it.  But its information that should be out there and available for people to make their own decisions regarding what happens with their food.

3866281,5,B0027BOL4G,"one of the most complete movies about americas current food industry. it shows us tyson and perdue chicken houses which most americans have ate before and shows you how they are raised in dark rooms in doors. it shows how the animals are being abused and what they are fed. it shows us corn and what our goverment is doing to have ridiculous amounts of corn grown and nothing else. corn is used for everything. its fed to animals and fed to humans, almost every processd food in the supermarket and fast food contains corn and hows its killing us. and it shows monsanto, the company which gentically modifies our seeds and bullies local and small farmers.
in this movie you will get a chance to see a rare free range livestock farm in virgnia of joel salatin. its beautiful and such a awsome farm. however most americans have not had a chance to eat fresh food like this. so if your wondering why are over 70% overweight, why were are over 30% obese, why so many americans are sick and have diabites then watch food inc. see the story how many of us don't have the choice to eat local and fresh food becuase the corporations how only giving us thier choices. the FDA who was suppose to protect us and the supreme court has monsanto's peoples running it.

3866296,2,B0027BOL4G,"Around 3/5ths through this hole filled documentary, a presumably Hispanic (likely Mexican) family expresses their role in this thing.  I find their particular lot in this largely their own fault.  Racial connotations aside, your time, and theirs, are one's own responsibility.  No one but one's self dictates how one's time is spent.  If one chooses convenience, over some degree of responsibility, he or she no longer truly has the right to ""bitch"" about it.  ""No time to cook"" implies a degree of neglect of one's children.  If this occurs regularly, then that person officially is trash.  Over $200 in medication, counterbalanced by an informed diet really only implies a large degree of responsibility lacking.
  We know the governments the world over have failed in the stewardship of their people. Well, cry about it, or take action?  A legitimate question, considering the loudest protestors rarely are accountable for the plight they decry (thus their noise serves only to agitate the cattle, instead of spending money on feeding the masses what they feel is proper).  It's a simple thing, complaining, and lamenting.  But at the end of the day, it's all our fault.  All legislature allows room for interpretation. And all therefor are allowed by us, the majority.  Big money means nothing if a retail vendor chooses not to accept some currency or another.
  You are to blame for the acts shown in this film.  You are to blame for your poor health, and all political failings. You are the devil you denounce.  You are the evil politician.  Because you would rather discuss it, or complain, instead of banding together with like-minded folk, and acting.  One such crowd though, will act so foolishly, and lack so much wisdom, they are little better than the poor treated so-and-so that they would support- while sitting in front of a T.V., and buying ANYTHING advertised. You are more suitable for food than the cows.  Which sadly (for all of us) seem somehow more possessed with logic than man.  I hope your cancer is as brutal as the complaints you lodge on others.

3866300,5,B0027BOL4G,I really got a lot from this film.  I found it to be non-preachy from an anti-meat perspective and over all very informative.  The reviewers that did not like the film may likely fall into the category of those who just don't want to hear the truth.  How can you argue with the fact that the USDA doesn't inspect nearly the amount that goes into our food supply that it needs to? How can you argue that it was okay to fail to announce a recall of meat that was known about 16 days before a young child died from e coli poisoning? I thought the film was very well done and promoted much thought after watching.,1328227200,,609,4.188034188034188

have come of changes in food production, I just stopped watching.  Really a bunch of do-gooder libby libs that see no value in more efficient food production that allows us to eat a wider variety of foods more cheaply.

I went from a meat eater who only sort of thought organic food was a good idea.
To a firm believer that farm to fork was the way to go, and the only way to avoid some of the nastiness that gets into our meat.
Seeing the way animals are treated (more like a science experiment than a living breathing thing) will make you realize that McDonald's isn't necessarily doing you a favor by having a $1 menu.
The rate in which Americans are becoming unhealthy and overweight is astonishing, but Food Inc really puts it into perspective.
My favorite part of the movie is with Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms (in Virginia) and he is just the most intelligent and profound thinker.

3866306,5,B0027BOL4G,"Just looking at the cover of this DVD will give you an idea of what lays ahead; however, the magnitude is astounding.  What you think you know, and what you actually know are two total worlds apart and this DVD proves it.  It takes what we have heard in the news and looks deeper, opening the doors to issues that have long since been considered taboo to some.  Images of abuse, neglect, and blatant disrespect for not only the animals, but also the farmers, workers, and environment by big companies is brought to light.  Companies like Perdue and Tyson, major retailers of chicken products, are just two of a handful of names that are mentioned and investigated.

This DVD gives you an all access pass into the inner workings of our food systems.  They take you by the hand and then throw you head first into the ugly truth behind the pretty packaging that you find in supermarkets.  That farm and cow you see on the label is actually a plant that uses a false front to hide the horrible treatment of both animals and, in some cases, the employees as well.  Cows stuffed so closely together that there is no room to breathe, manure all over the floor, caking their legs and their hides, as they are forced forward to the slaughter.  Chickens locked away with no light, forced to eat foods that make them grow too fast.  Their bodies are so heavy that their bones, which have been unable to keep up with the accelerated growth rate, can not handle the pressure.  They lay in the floor after only a couple of steps, and sometimes, they never again get up.  Workers wade through the mass of chickens who struggle to  get out of there way as the men and women retrieve the dead carcasses of the chickens and throw them to the side to be collected and dumped.

The world runs on the principle of supply and demand.  With the introduction and advances of the fast food industry, the meat industry has been hard pressed to come up with the supply to meet the demand.  The answer they have chosen not only affects the animals, but us as well, though we don't know it.  The food companies have done a wonderful job of laying a veil over our eyes, preventing us from seeing what exactly goes into our food and how it gets from point A to point B and then to us.  Food, inc. rips away the veil and it will leave you speechless.

I must warn you, though.  If you are easily upset or queasy, be careful when watching this movie.  It is interesting, informative, but also intense.  I will recommend it to my family and friends in hopes that they too will see what is happening and move to make a change.  This film shows that we can't depend on the government to change the standards, only ourselves.

If you watch it, don't forget to see what it is trying to show you.  Take a deep look and install these images in your memory for when you go to the store next time.  When you're standing before the meat section, internally debating about what you want to fix that night, stop and read the label.  Look for where it is made, what is in it, and keep going from there.

Watch.  Listen.  Learn.

Most importantly...

Apply!  Apply what you learn to your future choices so that the food industry has no choice but to change the way they handle our food.  The substance that goes in not only our mouths, but the mouths of our families.

It is not a movie to make you become vegetarian, but lets you see how the subsidized farming has replaced the family farmer and how regulations are killing the smaller but healthier farms. This movie opened my eyes to so much more! OMG...really? After seeing this, my shopping habits changed yet again. My family has been fervent about growing our own food and getting out of the ""chain store"" shopping as much as we can afford. It is a very well documented and presented movie. Not as gross as the PETA films, but certainly gets the point across. Just a side note: My husband and I were in Texas last year and we drove past some cattle ""fields"" similar to those shown in this movie.

Because of the reviews here, I purchased this fantastic documentary back on 9/5/10 for $22 & Amazon.com was gracious enough to also throw in there a free digital copy of the document for me to instantly stream while I was waiting for the Blu-Ray to arrive. As mentioned before by others, this documentary about the food industry is a raw-and-in-your-face fearless revelation about the inner-workings of the food industry & how the ""garbage-in-garbage-out"" adage is most true. This documentary not only gave me second thoughts about how the animals are treated but, even more so, how WE are poisoned (in the literal sense....just watch the part of the young boy that died)& condemned to avoidable & preventable illnesses due to how the food industry ""feeds the nation."" Others have successfully ranted about how horrendous this is, so I'll just say that this documentary effectively sheds light on all fronts of the food industry, products we purchase at the grocery store, down to fast food & chicken nuggets.

I also feel like there needed to be a message near the end about the real solution being to keep things small and local.  This is the key to avoiding control by big companies and government.

However, it presents a small fraction the information needed to give the viewer a complete picture of an enormous industry.  It doesn't even make any apologies for it.  Worse yet, what is presented as fact is most often opinion.

I don't know when it became commonplace for documentaries to be so one-sided, but the trend has ruined the genre for me.  I assume it started with Michael Moore, but who really cares.  Not a single time in this show did the director have anyone present a dissenting opinion.

I do not like WalMart, or its reasoning for why they are the largest buyer of organic food in the world (it was strictly a business decision, i.e. demand), but at least there is demand and WalMart, however horrible their employment practices and other business impacts, is at least ushering in what I hope will be an organic and local food revolution.

Oh, and everyone from the millionaire to the family on welfare needs to be able to purchase it as well.

3866334,1,B0027BOL4G,"This movie is a classic hit piece with no effort to present an unbiased review of the food industry. They say that they gave corporations opportunities for their input but I seriously doubt it given the effort this movie makes to purposely make them look bad.
  Probably one of the most telling parts of this movie is the chicken farmer that ended up losing her contract with the food industry. They paint her as a victim of the food industry's greed but the first thing I noticed when they showed her chicken barns where the lack of air circulation. She didn't have fans keeping the chickens cool and they were dying because of it. They showed some dead but I would bet that more chickens died on the way to the ""Big Five"" due to the additional stress of being loaded and shipped. The corporations can't have farmers delivering to them dead stock. But this movie made little mention of this but instead focused its attention on her plight and the ""bad"" corporations who put her in this situation, only there are numerous other chicken farmers who were making money.
  These type of people who produce these movies always look for victims and exploit them. They will put little or no weight on the victim possibly being responsible for their position. When you see this, take the entire movie with a giant grain of salt. They have an agenda and don't care what the truth is. No wonder the corporate bosses wanted nothing to do with this hit piece.
  Its so sad that our young generation is so suseptible to this kind of propaganda. They make sure that the one side is painted as evil while the other side victims. They make sure that the evil side is faceless and not human. They make certain that their viewpoint cannot be countered.
  There is some knowledge to be learned in this movie but the overall theme is just garbage. No corporate boss wants to put contaminated or questionable food into the market. There is no way they could know that it wouldn't come back to their family or friends.

I would not have known to question any of these recommended fitness techniques had I been formerly encouraged by family and culture to ""eat vegetables to sweep the toxins away from your stomach.""

Really opened my eyes quite a bit and felt quite sorry for the lone farmer who just wanted to sell non-GMO soybeans and had his whole life turned upside down by evil Monsanto. I wonder how anyone has any morals or a shred of dignity working for that company. Shame on you Monsanto!

I'm sure as people demand healthier food, Monsanto will jump on the bandwagon, hire this guy they financially brutalized and have him show them how to make seeds that are not Genetically modified.

3866375,5,B0027BOL4G,"I remember when I was in school, from Kindergarten unto Senior year of High School, there was always a poster in the lunch rooms that featured on the banner: ""YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT"". Followed by the current alignment in the food pyramid.

Today, with factory farming and Corporate food manufacturing extending even to farm crops that are chemically manipulated, radiated, in order to produce a more voluminous product for the ballooning consumer population, is it any wonder that old lunch room posters proclamation still rings true?

We are what we eat.

And that goes a long way to explain the cancers that plague our eliminatory organs;bowels, colon, rectum, stomach. As well as our impotence, given the byproducts that we absorb when we consume the flesh of animals that have been plumped to market beyond what nature and a decent diet would allow. Steroids, testosterone, estrogen, growth hormone, anti-biotics so as to stave off the infections factory farmed animals risk acquiring while warehoused for fattening and butchering.

The videos of sick cows being forklift prodded toward the stun gun so they can be killed and butchered and cut into pieces so that their dead flesh can be injected with red dye and placed under plastic wrap to look fit for the table.

Chickens, save for Purdue farms, who are fed a diet that includes their own excrement (Talk about you are what you eat!) and are also injected to be fatter, plumper, and produce a fatter bird for the price of a meal.

Is it any wonder then that women suffer breast cancer, and reproductive organ cancers? And the number one killer of women is heart disease?

Do we actually think byproducts of big business farming isn't going to affect us?

We are what we eat! And we're reaping what we sew.

This movie will wake you up so that the next trip to the grocery store, hopefully, makes for an informed consumer. And if you're fortunate enough to afford it, it could be a trip to an organic fresh foods supermarket, where free range meats, with no chemical saturation, are sold. Where free range eggs, milk, butters, cheeses, don't promise a meal with huge detrimental side effects on the menu later.

The only reason this big farm business flourishes like this is because we the consumer keep buying into it. And for our money? We suffer and die from the ailments our organs suffer because they simply can't handle the side effects of America's present day diet and food manufacturer.

It's worth doing the research and shopping responsibly, even if it's more expensive on the budget, than to pay the price of an affordable diet later, when the cost is far more deadly to the self than it was to the pocketbook.",1315785600,,2678,4.762419006479481

3866377,1,B0027BOL4G,"""Beware of the sound of one hand clapping.""  That is, the first side
of a story always sounds credible until you hear from the other side.

I really enjoyed watching Food Inc. twice.  Amazing cinematic production
and very entertaining. Although I disagreed w/ 90% of the film, it did
make some good points, and certainly promotes conversation.

I think the movie misses the biggest point of all: Americans are
hedonistic, pleasure-seeking folk who want their cake and to eat it too,
and now we're overweight and looking for someone else to blame rather
than practicing *self control.*

My take?  There's a lot they left out of the movie.  I believe people
should be given an *objective* view of the facts and then make up their
own minds rather than being presented only one side.  For example,
consider the following.

1.  First, let me say that in 2001 I converted over to organic food
to become healthier.  It didn't take me long to figure out that the
large organic farming companies are just as greedy and deceptive as
the conventional companies.  Many false claims are made to promote
their very expensive products.  After a while, I realized I wasn't
getting any healthier and didn't have enough money to keep buying the
organic, which has never* been shown to be healthier than
conventional produce.  The moral of this whole story?  ""Follow the
money trail.""  For example, the raw milk craze is based on people who
stand to make millions of dollars.  Raw milk is a highly lucrative
business and people are dying from drinking it, unfortunately.

2. Everyone believes producers put hormones in chicken feed. . . if they did,
the companies would go out of business because hormones
*don't work* in chickens as in beef.  It's throwing money down a hole.
Chickens grow off bigger today because we've bred them to have larger
breast muscles and have bred for faster growth, just like we've bred dairy
cows to have large udders and small muscles.

3. The angry chicken farmer woman in the movie refused to retrofit her
chicken house w/ a tunnel ventilation cooling system.  She wanted to
keep making her $25,000 per house profit ($100,000 for four houses)
and not put money back into the system.  The poultry companies
cannot afford to let those old school people keep their contracts
b/c the birds w/ open sided houses are much hotter and
uncomfortable, and it takes more feed and more time to grow the birds
off.  Very inefficient.  Tunnel ventilation-cooled poultry houses are
like air conditioning.

4. The movie presents a false image of poultry farming as taking
advantage of the farmers.  Some of the richest people in the south are
chicken farmers.  Currently, you cannot contract w/ a poultry company
unless you build (1) six chicken houses x $25,000 profit each =
$150,000 profit/year,  (2) ONLY a 15 year mortgage, so in 15 years,
you OWN the place and all you have to spend is upkeep, and (3) the
company brings you all the chicks, all the feed, a veterinarian, any
medications you need, and then picks the chickens up after 4-7 weeks.
There are hundreds of people who have left highly lucrative careers in
the south to go into poultry farming because they could make more
money there.  Now get this. . . On top of all of that, most people w/6
houses hire a farm hand to run the farm for them, then the farmer only
has to work 10 or 20 hours a week.

5. Remember the poor pitiful family that wouldn't cook their own food
at home?  They would spend $12 for hamburgers and sodas in their car,
but said that broccoli was too expensive at $1.29 a pound.(??)  For $5
they could have made 3.5 pounds of cheese broccoli.  ""But I don't like
cheese broccoli"" someone might say.  ""OK, well, that's why you're
fat,"" I might say.  Just because a person doesn't like eating healthy
food, doesn't mean they should blame their health problems on others.

Furthermore, the oldest daughter of that family had upper and lower
*BRACES* on her teeth.  So, the family could afford $6,000 to
straighten her teeth, but couldn't pay $3.87 for three pounds of
broccoli and now they blame everyone else but themselves for their bad
choices and the father's diabetes.(?)  Also, the oldest daughter had time
to go to a psychological support group counseling session to help her
deal with the fact that her father has diabetes, but she doesn't have
time to cook her family some beans and rice.(??)  Some Asian friends I went
to college with claimed they could eat for $30 a month.  How?  They
bought 40 lb. sacks of rice and cooked rice and dried beans.

6.  A large part of the movie was related to GMO soybeans, which
allows farmers to grow record levels of soybeans on very small pieces
of land.  Why do you think 90% of farmers use the GMO soybean seed described
in the film?  Because they have greater yields and make *more money*
than with the old seed.  Companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars
developing and promoting these products (which is why it is patented)
but now the guy who cleans seeds isn't willing to respect the company's
intellectual property rights and isn't willing to change with the
times.  Furthermore, GMO crops have never been shown to be harmful to
us or the environment.

7. The American Meat Institute is the trade association (spokesman)
for the meat industry.  It speaks for the companies so they won't get
in trouble and get sued.  AMI has requested since 1998 to be
interviewed by the producer of Food Inc. and to be included in the
2009 movie, but Food Inc. denied them this.  An articulate,
intellectual response to their ideas would ruin the whole show.

8. If America went 100% organic, we would have to deforest the country to grow
enough food for everyone.  Modern agriculture is many times more efficient
than we were 100 years ago, meaning we are using less land than we would be
using under the old system.  Thus, modern farming is more environmentally-friendly
with regard to carbon emissions, greenhouse
gases, and land usage.

9. Some supermarket chains have been pressured into only selling milk
from cows that have not been given hormones.  The fact is that hormones
*do not* enter the milk of the cow.  The meat?  Yes.  The milk?  No.
What does this mean?  It means the supermarket chains now use milk
produced *less efficiently*, requiring more feed, more land, more
money, and more natural resources.  Reducing hormone usage in cattle
reduces milk and meat efficiency which leads to a greater environmental
burden.

10. The movie demonizes raising cattle in feedlots.  The fact is,
cattle are pasture-raised (grass-fed, hay-fed) for years and then for
the last 5 months, they are fattened up in feed lots.  It has never
been proven that grass-fed cattle lead to lower cases of E. coli than
feedlot cattle.  Currently, there is an E. coli strawberry outbreak
in Oregon.  Guess where they traced the E. coli back to?  DEER feces,
from grass-fed deer.

11. Another myth is that hormones in conventional beef are causing
girls to mature faster.  The fact is, girls reaching puberty is
contingent on the amount of *body fat* they have, because excess fat
leads to excess hormone production in the body.  That's why female
olympic gymnists often don't reach puberty until they are in their
20's, because they have almost zero body fat.  A fat adolescent who
eats only organics is going to reach puberty BEFORE a skinny
adolescent who eats conventional hormone-produced beef at every-meal.
Why are girls reaching puberty faster today?  Because our society is
overweight.  Weight problems are at epidemic proportions in grades
3-6, thus the situation w/ the girls reaching puberty earlier.

12. The world's population is growing at 1.2% a year.  We can't afford
to go back to the old inefficient system.

13.  The current scientific data says that conventional vs. organic foods
are equivalent in nutrition and safety (except for unpasteurized milk,
which is more dangerous).

Are there problems with the modern system?  Certainly.  We can go over
those sometime, if you like.

My Recommendations?

First and foremost, hear both sides of the story.  Beyond that:

1. Don't overeat.  Don't get diabetes or heart disease.  Excess body
fat is also the single *biggest* predictor of contracting cancer
(besides smoking, of course; also alcohol contributes to 7 known types of cancer).

2. Cut back on saturated fat and refined carbohydrates (e.g., sugar,
white flours, breads, pastas, crackers, chips, potatoes).

3. Eat high fiber (buy the high fiber or double fiber bread, fiber
cereal, etc.) including more fruits and vegies.

4. I take sugar-free generic brand Metamucil every night and with high-fat meals (fried foods, pork, beef, cheese, etc.)  It
contains soluble fiber that *sucks up* fat like a sponge so your body
won't.  It will lower
your triglycerides and lower your LDL bad cholesterol and raise your
HDL good cholesterol.  In the past year, I've increased my good (HDL)
cholesterol from 40 to 60 with fiber + 2,000 mg niacin a day, and have
dropped my triglyceride levels from in the high range to the low
range.

5. Remove *PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED* oils
from your diet, which contain trans-fats - bad.

6. Exercise 30 min. a day.",1315526400,199,9184,4.812020460358056

3866379,4,B0027BOL4G,"Here are two facts about myself I'm going to share with you to put this in perspective. Fact the first...I am a fan of food. I don't just like to eat per se but I like to experience and try new foods. I am a foodie if you will, but I am in no way a food snob. This is the obvious fact as evidenced by my ever expanding waistline. The other fact is that while I enjoy documentaries, I try not to watch ones that have a political undertone since I get all fired up about them. I don't really watch the news for that same reason. Politics are bad for my mental health. So it was with some slight trepidation that I watched ""Food, Inc.""

Let me start off by saying that you should never trust a documentarian. They usually seem to have an agenda and it often times seeps into the film itself. So with that in mind, ""Food, Inc."" is a film about the way we eat. Or more correctly, the way our food is produced and packaged and brought to the consumer. It is a fascinating subject because it is something that effects every person in the country but it is a topic that most of us never stop to consider. The film touches on many aspects of the food industry: the industrialization of farming and the changes to reality that it has brought to our farming communities, both physically and economically; the virus like spread of corn into all of the products we eat which is often not immediately apparent to consumers; and the genetic tampering and short-cuts the food industry has taken to give the consumer what it wants at the cost of nutrition and, as a consequence, our health. These points are presented well and are thought provoking.

But the real revelation of the film, at least for me, was the depiction of the food industry as a shadowy and powerful cabal in the US government. According to the film, they have positioned themselves into power by exempting themselves from trust laws, keeping their operations a strictly guarded secret, and paying low wages to employees who work in dangerous and filthy environments. All of this leads to risks to the health of the public at large. What is truly shocking, if true, is how the food industry has effectively made the USDA and FDA powerless to regulate and enforce sanctions on them. Realizing that they have made organizations that are meant to protect us toothless in the pursuit of capitalism is, well, part of what gets me all fired up and why I try to avoid these things.

The above is contrasted by images of the local farmer, the organic grower, companies that care about the well being of the public and the environment. So the message is to eat local, eat organic, eat seasonal, stop The Man. (By the way, this is spelled out explicitly in an interminable ""you-should-do-this"" sequence at the end.) And that is my main problem with the film. I understand they are trying to get a message across. But they only pay lip service to the negatives, if at all. For one, the film does touch on the expense of eating organic and local yet it is a short segment and incomplete at that. The fact of the matter is that it is significantly more expensive to buy organic and local products. Many families simply can't afford to do this. The film seems to suggest that this is also the doing of the food industry. While the industry does play a part, the flip side is not significantly explored. Also, zero mention is made (from what I recall) of what organic produce does to the population of the world at large. I have heard jokes told that for every ""progressive"" yuppie enjoying their organic apple, 100 people are dying of starvation in the third world. The simple fact is...if all we produced was local and organic, we couldn't support the worlds population. Who knows if we could even support our own. While it is all well and good to say it is better for your health, I'm sure those starving appreciate your moral stance against a genetically modified kumquat.

""Food, Inc."" is a good film and I encourage you to see it. Listen to what it has to say but don't go off the deep end and keep it in perspective.

The first hour focuses on the massive changes that have occurred in the ways that food reaches the American consumer. While our food packages often picture small farms on their labels, much of our food comes from a few large companies. Food, Inc. comments on a number of alarming practices that these companies use to increase food production and cut costs. Viewers will not look at their food in the same way after watching Food, Inc.

Unfortunately, as mentioned, the filmmakers try to cover too much ground and Food Inc. loses focus in its final 30 minutes. Among other topics, the film covers the use of illegal immigrants in the food industry and includes a long segment on Monsanto's attempts to corner the market on certain seeds.

There are arguments by the food multinationals that at current food production levels (bushels/acre) there is not enough arable land to feed the world's population. The key to ensuring food supply is increasing the efficiency (bushels/acre) of the land so that enough food can be produced.

It's as if we are eating a ""notion"" of food and not the actual original God given morsel.  It's really really depressing watching this video.  This earth makes more than enough food to feed everyone organically well on this planet, yet, the large corporations are running our food system from seed to the supermarket and therefore control quality (or lack thereof) and pricing.  Wish we could all share what God intended for us to eat on this earth; his natural food in it's natural state.  Greed is the reason behind altering corn seeds/plants, implementing HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup) in just about every product, steroids and hormones in meat, and other non-necessary chemical additives.

I'm no vegetarian (although I'm thinking of becoming one) but just doesn't make sense to me why these huge corps pump chemicals into our food!  It makes me want to scream. Worse yet, taste an organic piece of fruit and then taste a pesticide sprayed chemically altered one and see which one tastes better.  The organic strawberry would win hands down.  Organic food isn't just good for you, it tastes better!

Oh well, I'll step off of my ranting soap box, but, we must all make a change when buying food.  If we each bought one organic item everytime we shopped, maybe these corporations would have no choice but to compete for having the best organic food and produce.

My personal experiences at stock barns, farms, food factories, grocery stores, restaurants, etc., was realistic and many times a horror, but this movie shows us what our country has come to and what the average consumer isn't aware of, is complacent to, or just plain apathetic about.

It shows us who's running the country in regard to what we are dependent on... FOOD. It should kick the mentality of intelligent people into not buying into the propaganda we are fed, and becoming less dependent on the buying that we now experience. Peoples' lives are apparently not as precious as the almighty dollar. Our government is also slacking off by letting this go on by not putting more people with integrity into the jobs associated with our food consumption system. Animals as well as humans are being degraded and treated less than inhumane. Putting thought back into how we live now as compared to 50 years ago, may rattle some cages and the truth may get them to show some real patriotism and caring about others in this country.

I think that watching this movie would be educating as well as motivating to any human being who watches it! Diseases and health issues are rampant and this movie gives us a glimpse into that. What I really admire, is that this isn't a PETA documentary, but written by an omnivore just like me.

Balancing food quantity, quality, and safety is no doubt a delicate balancing act that has global hunger implications -- I only wish this film covered more of that topic instead of simply slamming the food industry. Our food supply may not be perfect, but let's face it; it is the best in the world by a large margin.

I had no idea that I was being 'corn fed' by eating what I thought was healthier choices.  My mind was blown away when I learned of all the products that contain corn; ketchup, mustard, mayo, fish and more.  The products that contain corn (and a ton of chemicals) are endless.  After watching the movie, I was so fired up that I was just learning where my food came from in my 30's I decided to write a health blog, I have given health talks to women and I have hosted several weight loss competitions.

You only get one body, and at least in the near term, we only get one planet.  We better start acting like good stewards of God's Creation.  This is not a shunning of capitalism, nor science, it is the lack of a good feedback loop in the process of improving food delivery.

I buy organic, not just because I think the organic methods are always better, it is because of the additional scrutiny in the process of the delivery of the food.  I think that companies built around quality make a better model of how products should be produced.  I think they treat their workers better, take more care in the creation of the food since they know the ""organic"" label is valuable, and they treat their animals better.  Labeling is what allows consumers to vote with their dollars.

It is indefensible to think we are not allowing food to be labelled properly and allow the end consumer to know what they are buying!  This is the feedback loop to tell the producers what the consumers expect.  The ""Free Market"" does not work when the labeling is insufficient to allow for this essential feedback loop.  Our government is corrupt, without a doubt, and we need more accountability and transparency in this process.

The Monsanto lawsuits are the most disturbing thing in this movie, I agree that a company can protect their patents for a period of time, to allow for fair compensation, but using the legal system to financially subjugate individuals that participate in the food delivery chain is a perversion of the law!  This is very disturbing, this may be why we have the second amendment.

Our government is a product of the populace, Thomas Jefferson put it best ""Whenever people are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own government"" -TJ

We are responsible, we the voters must assert our rights to good food, humanely raised food, good governance is our responsibility.

Film makers like Gore and Moore believe their audiences aren't smart enough to figure out the issue, so they resort to pandering and preaching. They overlook contrasting viewpoints and only present what they believe to be the facts. Their documentaries work on an emotional instead of a rational level and should be treated as short, bizarre films only. Documentaries by nature should be informative, innovative, and as balanced as can be. This simple formula eliminates many of these baised and unbalanced films and simply aren't worht the time. They are only viewed by people who already support that viewpoint.

3866426,1,B0027BOL4G,"A friend highly recommended the movie, so it was particularly disappointing.

More government regulation of food is what got us to a few companies processing most of our food in a few facilities. Government regulations in the name of safety mean small farms and small processing plants cannot afford the mandated equipment. Big companies can lobby government to get rules written and subsidies for their products. Stop subsidizing corn production and stop diverting corn to make ethanol.

If corporate managers and directors at competing companies are not accountable when they have to keep their customers from migrating to non-industrial farming, what makes the film makers or their on-screen speakers think that the USDA can do a better job if there were just more laws?",1306022400,23,773,5.225806451612903
3866427,5,B0027BOL4G,"I saw all the great reviews and decided to watch this movie and it was certainly worth my time. The movie was not only entertaining, but also very informative and educational.

This movie really brings to light the injustices and disservice that the US food industry (Tyson, Monsanto are some of the corporations named in this movie) is doing to our nation and our people. Throughout the movie, you see the fear and threats farmers and ranchers have to deal with from the food industry. You see how much of the food industry is controlled by a few big corporations, and how they have infiltrated our government and agencies such as the FDA. Food companies refuse to label food from cloned animals. The movie even tells of a story about a young kid who died because of E-coli in his hamburger meat. And we all thought that technology is supposed to improve our lives...

But there is hope. Ultimately, things are based on economics, and even corporations like Wal-Mart will respond to consumer demand for things like milk from cows not treated with rBST (growth hormone). Every time you purchase something from a grocery store, that's a vote from you telling the grocery store, and the food industry, what kind of food product you want.

The current food production system is based upon utter cruelty to animals, exploitation of unskilled workers, and it keeps the lower-income masses ill and obese. It's all founded upon corruption.

There must be spiritual and moral ramifications from eating food from this system. I also wonder what it does to our bodies. A week before watching this, I read a news article that American kids are reaching puberty now at hitherto unknown ages: down to age 8. Could it be from all the hormone-laced meats?

Many cannot afford the alternatives, but for those who can, buying fresh, cruelty-free, free-range, grass-fed meats and organic fruits/veggies is the way to beat the system.",1302998400,,798,5.178294573643411
3866441,3,B0027BOL4G,"Like the food industry, this movie falls short on presenting the science and statistics. There are several interesting sights, as well as some that will shock you pretty hard, but that's where the positives end.

Many stories were so slow and had so much repeated scenery that the whole film could've been compressed down to 20 minutes, leaving plenty of time for more detail. The organic section was confusing and was unclear in presentation on position. The end points to each section of the film delivered in interest, only to give way to a new topic entirely. There were only a few statistics in the film, i.e., those related to premature diabetes and costs. Much of the science is left uncertain, i.e., high fructose corn syrup is brought up as a topic, but then left unassociated with the rest of the film.

I was also frustrated to see ""Person XYZ declined an interview"" for every other person. Seriously, why the hell even include so many people if they wouldn't sit down with the producers? Go out there and find other people, and preferably people who can pop a story full of information. I feel like I paid my ticket for the show just to find out it's closed due to maintenance.

Two of the movie scenes were really dumb. As for the 10-minute immigrant video in the style of ""COPS"" - are you kidding me? There has to be a better way of showcasing ""companies paying immigrants below minimum wage"" than spending 15% of the film on gun scenes like these. As for the other scene, the dollar menu family of four who can't afford to eat, seriously that was just pathetic. If you're fat and can't afford to eat/not enough time... swap for skim milk or eat less.

Overall, the film feels like a string of loosely-connected partial interviews and hidden camera videos that have either a comical or sleepy feel, and sleepy in the not-detailed-enough sense. While the film showcases the evils of the food companies, this film has its own evil of selectively having you fill in the blanks... a lot of blanks. I have no idea what Eric Schlosser was thinking when he visioned an industry-changing 90-minute film, but I doubt this was it. Just save yourself and go read Fast Food Nation.

Mainstream Media and Hollywood offer much needed services for the world; however, it's still refreshing to get the ""Little Guys"" opinion every once in a while, if for no other reason to ensure we gain a COMPLETE picture of our surroundings. First thing is first, THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES. Instead, this movie outlines that while bigger companies grow in size and develop ways to feed LARGE amounts of the population at a RESONABLE price point, that inevitably compromises must be made. Unfortunately, as you watch this movie you are made aware of how drastic these Compromises are, and how they affect the Quality and Nutrition of our food supply. It also adds that every time you choose to buy food that is produced for the `MASSES"", that you are in essence ""casting your vote of approval"". Conversely, if we choose to buy from local farms and natural/organic food processing plants, we will encourage this behavior. If enough of us make this choice, one day the Big Companies will see a chance to make money and will start investing into more appropriate food practices. Another disturbing fact the movie points out is ""the average distance food travels before it gets to our grocery stores"". With the average distance ranging from 1200-1600 miles, that made me wonder what would happen if there were a few ""Temporary"" disruptions in this food chain. For example, bad weather, high gas prices, trucker strikes, terrorist attacks, ect. It just seems to me that if we continue to rely on the Inefficient System that these Big Food processors use to feed us, we are setting ourselves up for failure. I would rather spend MORE MONEY NOW and ensure a healthier existence than spend MORE MONEY LATER for medications and hospitals bills from the poor quality of food that I ate while I was young!",1301529600,,1895,4.851851851851852

While illegal immigration is not a valid point here...it does have implications in the long run. In Nebraska,Wisconsin and Iowa we do see large companies hire illegal aliens (exploiting them and bringing crime, poverty and complexity into this society).

3866464,5,B0027BOL4G,"""Food Inc.""- released in 2008 - is a excellent report on the American Food Industry, how it evolved from small farms to big mass production slaughter houses and genetically engineered feed and animals.  Everything is bigger, faster, cheaper, and causing unintended consequences.  Because of all the salt, fat and sugar in the fast food industry, America's children are in a Type 2 Diabetes epidemic.  Diabetes is hitting children and younger ages.  The food system is skewed toward obesity.  The treatment of animals in big corporate farms is disgusting.  I applaud Robert Kenner's docuentary that exposes the detrimental effects on our population, environment and health.  I never realized how corn is used in so many products and that cows are herbivores by nature.  We feed them and other animals corn to make them fatter faster.  Genetically developed chickens are top heavy and rased in squalid crowded conditions.  This film will definitely affect the way I eat.  And of course there are people in power with special interests that feel no gain in protecting the average American against e-coli and bad food production.  Food is getting more and more expensive, due to drought, floods, higher oil prices to transport and overpopulation.  There may be no motivation to end this industry rife with monopolies and lax interpretation of laws.

I have been buying organic and green products for quite some time. It is more expensive but isn't everything else too cheap? I have become more conscious about the whereabouts of everything as I don't want to die from food poisening or cancer anytime soon.
Who is to blame for the death of children who have died in agony over contaminated meat products? What should we learn from little Kevin's death 12 days after he ate an ""innocent"" hamburger (contaminated wih e-coli)?

I've always been an animal lover, I work with shelters, and of course have my own pets - but honestly, now that I KNOW what goes on, and have faced the truth, I will never eat meat again.

3866484,5,B0027BOL4G,"This DVD tells a story that is appalling to people concerned with truth in general and with their and others' health. Are the facts in the story true? I believe they are because there are a number of confirming books, videos, and magazine articles that tell similar stories. So, if the story is true, then the situation regarding many foods sold to the public in the United States is appalling. I suspect the situation is the same to at least some degree in other countries so the story concerns all of us. I mean who really has faith in the mass-produced foods imported from China or Brazil? Have you ever seen the videos of Pangasius fish farms in Vietnam or  salmon farms in Norway and the ones the Norwegians have opened in Canada? What is truly scary is the extent to which we suspect the corruption of some of our representatives in Washington and some key officers in the federal agencies meant to protect the public. With the disastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens' Union case which opens the floodgates of corporate and self-interested money that can be spent toward political ends, whose influence was confirmed absolutely in the recent Congressional elections, we, the public, are left exposed and unprotected unless we take action ourselves.
How can we take action? Stop buying processed foods, farmed fish, non-organically raised meat. Buy organic from trusted sources. It will cost more money but then you know that you need to reduce the volume of food that you eat so do it now and save some or all of that additional cost.
No amount of public outrage will persuade a representative to vote against the interests of a corporation that finances his election campaign because our system is such that he has no option to get elected or re-elected. No amount of public outrage will change our overly technical and procedure-heavy legal system that allows a hugely wealthy Monsanto to financially exhaust a farmer whose non-GM fields become polluted by wind-borne patented GM seeds and spores. The only way to cause change is to stop buying these terrible products and by-products and make market forces do the work that we can no longer trust others to do for us. We'll become slimmer and healthier at the same time.",1296777600,,2239,4.815584415584415

So the fact that I generally love documentaries surprises e.

Food Inc was one I put off for a very long time. I'm not naive - and maybe that's why I did put it off - because I know just enough. But seeing is different than knowing.

Super Size Me and King Corn of two of my favorite documentaries. Food Inc both picks up where they left off and becomes the missing piece of the puzzle. I expected to be challenged and horrified by Food Inc, but I didn't expect to be as moved as I was.

Some of the statistics and facts presented are staggering. Animals housed and fed to become the end product that are so heavy that their legs can't hold them, diseased animals tossed into the meat mix, A semi-solution that is not taken wherein the cattle being fed a different diet for days could kill 80% of the e coli bacteria. Farmers carrying debt of a half million but making a mere 18K a year. Larger corporations refusing to make statements or appear on camera. Those are almost enough to paint a compelling picture of serious issues.

But there's more....the family who eats dollar hamburgers from a fast food outlet based on budget restrictions of both time and money. This same family is shown in the grocery store lamenting the $1.29 per pound price tag on broccoli and when a daughter looks longingly at pears, they are weighed and rejected because $.99 price tag per pound would only buy them two or three pears. However, pop was cheap. The father was diabetic. The mother explained that $260.00 a month went to his two diabetic medications. They had to make a decision between food that might make them all healthier and medicine to keep him healthy.

Then there was the political activist who became one when she lost her small child to e coli from tainted burger.

I could go on but I won't.

If you are concerned about what goes into your mouth, and the mouths of those you care about, you need to look further into America's food supply and Food Inc could be a good starting point.",1296604800,,2250,4.420289855072464

These corp's mandate that chickens not see any light, ever, so that the public may never see the abuse imposed on them.  These chickens and pigs, crowded with their siblings and parents, in NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP FASHION, WATCH each of their associates, one by one, be brutally and heartlessly murdered, while they SCREAM BEGGING TO LIVE.  The pigs are killed in one factory at the rate of 2,000 per HOUR--dumped ALIVE into a big bin on top of each other into a bin below, as though they are garbage.  What doesn't kill them in the dump, kills them when a big metal CRUSHER COMES DOWN AND CRUSHES THEM ALL INTO A DEAD MASS (like they demo. automobiles).  The 4 corp's do what they do because a humane fashion wouldn't make them as rich.  They'd rather be rich than not poisoning us, feeding the animals grass, not shooting them with growth hormones etc. It's a life changing outrage that needs to be addressed, STARTING WITH ALL OF US REFUSING TO BUY THEIR PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

One point that was raised is the fact that $1 menu places are more affordable than healthier food in a store; a direct contributor to the growing epidemic of childhood obesity. A lot of the argument may remain dormant unless parents can get their kids away from the video games and insist they get some exercise. Lots of other points are raised, and should be considered.

3866506,4,B0027BOL4G,"What did I know before genetic modification and its effect on the public before I initially viewed this film?  What's more, what did I know about the factors involved with mass production of our nation's (and world's) food supply?  In all honesty, not too much. Though, I did a brief research paper/documentary film, while a student of biology in high school (in the mid 1990s) on the moral and scientific implications of genetically modified produce that was being engineered and churned out into supermarkets on a nation-wide (as well as global) scale. The idea of tomatoes ""immunized"" with protein derived from fish enzymes, to make them bigger, redder and quicker to ripen on the vine was almost a joke - but, a very bad one indeed. When you watch FOOD, INC. it sobers us all to the reality (and danger) of mass production on the consumer's side, as well as those directly engaged in production and distribution (farmers, companies and stores that carry food laden with GMO's and hormones, etc).

We are presented with stark contrasts, in this piece of documentary insight. On one hand, we see the source of our nation's meat - chickens, pigs, cows - in almost unlivable situations, while cooped up in rooms that are barely breathable, where sanitation is non existent and the ethical/business practices of the parties responsible are nothing short of appalling. Visceral imagery is presented of hormone and water plumped chickens, who are all entrapped in one dark, cold, dirty silo, barely able to move a quarter of an inch. They are then heartlessly prepared for the market (execution style) with no consciousness of the effect of breeding and killing practices and how they might ultimately effect the health of the consumer eating them, fried and dressed, on the dinner table, just a month or two down the line.
We see appalling depictions of the reality of pig farming (details so disgusting I will not divulge here), as well as the effect of super powers (like Monsanto) on farmers in the Midwestern United States, as well as on a global scale. By now, many people are well aware of the evil and tremendous amount of power that this company wields in our world - agriculturally speaking. I think it is safe to say that 75 % of our nation's food (as well as food that is mass produced internationally) comes from production companies that buy seed (or are made to buy seed) from this company. Unless, of course, the consumer or market/grocery store has access to locally grown, non - GMO based produce (that doesn't merely mean ""organic"" sometimes).

The film also examines how people have gone organic over the decades, how it got started with companies like Morningstar Farms (distributors of soy based products - like veggie bacon and buffalo wings) and Stonyfield Farms (distributors of yogurts). Though, it is intriguing and even inspiring to see how the two (aforementioned) companies got their start in their industries, it is also a cautionary reflection of the ""go Organic"" approach to mass production. Morningstar Farms is owned by Kellogg Company (cereals, etc) and Stonyfield Farms sells their products to Walmart. As I learned of this, I couldn't help but feel cynical.  Also, where do you suppose Kellogg gets their supply of grain for, say, corn flakes?  I will let you come to the answer of your own accord.

Watch this film - it will shed some light on a very important topic - our food, how it is being produced in this ""Fast Food Nation"" and why (to paraphrase the old adage) we truly are what we eat.",1290643200,,3530,4.824793388429752

  Well when I was seven years old that worked pretty well at getting me to shut my mouth at his fathers bad cooking and just eat it. Now that I'm an adult I would rather not eat poison, and I most certainly don't want to feed it to my children (as a side note my childhood friend feeds his children much better than his dad fed him as well). Food INC. is nothing short of eye opening, jaw dropping, in your face proof that the food industry is not to be trusted. Not only is our food supply tainted with bacterial killers while the industry refuses to truly fix the problem, but we are being sold poor health as well. Farmers are being told to raise chickens in a certain way which they know is not healthy for the chicken or for us. Cattle are being raised on corn based feed that promotes ecoli growth, and they are being kept in unsanitary conditions which also can impact our health. They industry has created soy beans that are immune to round-up (you know so they can spray that same round up on the crops to kill the weeds but not the soy beans). They are shaking down farmers to force them to buy their hybred crops or be eliminated from the market, and forced into bankruptcy. The amount of eye opening scenes come one after another.

Most of these changes were simple enough to make and actually taste better then some of the other stuff I got. I just wish it was cheaper to eat healthy than it is to eat crap food.

3866526,5,B0027BOL4G,"This isn't Michael Pollan's film, but his comments nevertheless stand out to me. Pollan's logic is irrefutable. Has anyone heard a cogent rebuttal to him from Monsanto or Tyson's or the Iowa Farm Bureau? No, they just fume about how ""food activists"" are taking cheap shots at the good and noble and virtuous occupation of farming. Their standard mantra is that American farmers produce safe, cheap, and nutritious food. But they cannot have it both ways--declining to be interviewed and then charging food journalists with unbalanced reporting. They do not answer the hard questions about modern agribusiness (it's not farming anymore) because they cannot.

Two contrasting images stand out for me in the film. One is the image of the coldly efficient slaughterhouse. The other is of Joel Salatin butchering chickens. Are the images morally equivalent? I think not. There is nothing intrinsically evil about slaughtering animals. But the modern mega-slaughterhouse is evil. (Cue Iowa Farm Bureau  rebuttal mantra.) CAFO's are evil. Local processing is the way animals should be slaughtered. (Cue USDA warning on trying this without jumping through their regulatory hoops.) And it isn't just the slaughterhouse that is evil. The whole industrial-agriculture production system is morally corrupt, including the regulatory apparatus. (As noted in the film, the ""regulatory apparatus"" tried to close Joel Salatin down.)

I like the end of the film alot because it offers practical recommendations. It is very simple. The recommended action is: vote with your pocketbook. Change your buying habits. Find new food sources. Stop buying what is unhealthy, start buying what is healthy. Buy local.",1286064000,,1688,5.4106463878327

This is a tremendous amount of food that has to be produced on a daily basis. What this film reveals is the dichotomy between the mass food producers and the small producers.

The small producers are seen as the ethical heroes who want things to be done in the clean old fashion way. On the other hand the massive food producers are seen as ruthless unethical businessmen. Graphic images of cows up to their knees in their own filth, and illegal immigrant workers with fingernail infections are seen. But the reality is that the small producers can never meet, or even come close to the vast daily demands for food.

There is an obvious problem here, if it is not addressed soon there can be some sort of food borne illness that can quickly spread, killing untold numbers in its path. After watching the movie (because you won't be sure what parts of it are staged) you ask yourself, what can we do about this? Most of us will quietly say nothing and after 15 minutes go on to the next movie.

3866563,5,B0027BOL4G,"I am a PROCESSED-FOODS CONVERT, thanks to this amazing documentary, and subsequently others similar to it in nature.

Before, I mindlessly went about my daily life, buying processed foods and easy take-out for too many years, being a busy working mom with two kids in two activities at a time. Hey, they wouldn't put anything to compromise our health in those boxes. Yeah....right....

Since about April of this year, I've been researching & learning about natural foods, enzymes and how incredibly valuable they are for us all, and most shockingly, what's happening to our food supply right under our very noses as we go about our busy lives, assuming everything is just fine.

There is so much MSG & HFCS (High fructose corn syrup) in the majority of processed foods, which so many of us are eating AND feeding our children, not to mention the genetic modification of the very seeds we need to sustain life, which this film documents and explains very, very well.

Companies are patenting and modifying the very DNA of the plants we eat and feed our livestock & poultry. Let that sink in for a moment. One of those also makes a very potent & popular weed killer. Hmmmm....food supply owners AND poison factory? The same company? Hmmmmmm...

If you educate yourself by buying growth-hormone free, antibiotic free, non-genetically modified 100% ORGANIC vegetable, dairy and meat products, you VOTE WITH YOUR DOLLARS & the producers will get the message. The first documentary I watched on the subject was Food, Inc., and is a real eye-opener. This led to the viewing and further investigation of others. The more I uncovered, the more upset I became, but then I empowered myself again, as I am in charge of what I put into my body!

I also got the KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus 5-Quart Stand Mixer, in Black, at the same time, to make this new lifestyle choice less a chore & more doable. It's the best kitchen appliance I've ever owned, and makes cooking from scratch easy, peasy! Clean up is also a snap. This all came together for me because of this movie, and Michael Pollan's ""Food Rules"".

The Fannie Farmer cookbook, recommended to me 15 years ago by my sister-in-law as a must-have, truly is a must-have! You will not be sorry, and even the pickiest of eaters will not be able to get enough.

***IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WANTING TO LOSE WEIGHT:

It has been my experience that eating REAL food without added fillers, preservatives & other chemical alteration FILLS YOU UP much faster than the processed stuff. MUCH! You'll have a lot of food left over when you cook and eat this way - the way we were meant to, so stock up on some freezer containers or a vacuum sealer. I got both.

Doctors & alternative health practitioners stress that we should eat natural sugars, not artificial sweeteners. Eat actual, natural foods from this Earth, without all the added nonsense, and you'll naturally eat less.

3866567,5,B0027BOL4G,"When I saw, ""from the makers of the Inconvenient Truth"", on the case, I thought, ""I'll never watch that"". Global warming (the man-made kind) is complete BS in my mind, and unless we resume testing atmospheric testing of h-bombs, I am very unlikely to change.

I say that only to illustrate the apparent inconsistency in giving this documentary 5 stars.

Film-wise, the film is very well done. The real-life characters were well chosen and seemed to be good down-to-earth Midwestern folks. That lent a lot of credibility IMO. Politically (a reason I do not watch similarly themed documentaries) I thought it more balanced than most. True, Bush 43's mug was mentioned as well as some in his administration, but Clinton was mentioned too.

It wasn't all-corporations-are-evil, all-the-time either. I liked the balance of one farmer who supposedly does it ""the right way"". Here, we could see the slaughtering of chickens, and to some this may appear as bad as the mass-production style of killing, but leaving the distinction up to the viewer was a good choice. I also liked the organic company who does business with Walmart. The CEO's sense of win-win, that is, making a profit while still adhering to the mission of no pesticides, fertilizer, etc., was a good choice too for the film.

The food system is so out-of-sight and out-of-mind in our lives that only the staunch nutritionists I know realize any of the things mentioned in the film. Consequently, I believe most of it is definitely true. One can certainly argue that it is impossible to feed 6 billion people without assembly-line techniques being employed. That is process-oriented change stuff though. When they start altering natural evolution at my expense, that is where I walk over to the ""enough already"" side.

The one thing this documentary does for me is confirm a belief I already hold: The United States government is nothing but a huge multi-trillion dollar whorehouse. Corporations pay the pimps (Lobbyists) who buy the whores (Congressmen, Senators, and the White House) who in turn forces their slaves (The American People) to bend over and take it.

This film achieved its objective I think as I will not be able to look at another food product again without reading the label and *this time*, researching what those unpronounceable ingredients are and how they affect my body.

Sometimes this means passing up some of those great sales on chicken and tons of other products...Oh...and since watching this DVD we have vowed never to purchase another Tyson product again.

3866575,5,B0027BOL4G,"Food, Inc. will change the way you think about food and where it comes from. This documentary on the food industry delves into the business behind food production and the dark side of farming.

A few multi-national companies control the vast amount of food production and dictate how farmers and growers run their operations. Though the documentary interviews individual farmers and workers, the huge corporations all seemed to decline to be interviewed.

The documentary shows chicken growing productions where enormous chicken houses without access to light are a primary method for producing chickens. The conditions inside the chicken houses are disgusting and chickens are packed together with little room to move. They are fed hormones and antibiotics which reduce the chick to adult gestation period from 70 to 49 days. This growth is so rapid that the internal organs and body structure are not equipped to support the chicken.

The documentary also shows enormous feed lot cattle productions where cattle are fed corn though the natural food is grass for cows. The cows stand in large amounts of their own manure which makes it much easier to spread Ecoli to the cows and sometimes ends up in the final product.

Workers at a pork processing plant in North Carolina are interviewed to discuss the poor working conditions and what seems to be uncaring nature of the company towards it's workers. The conditions for the animals when they are growing are poor as well. They are  confined to a small cage rather than free to roam. It seems to be a mass production factory rather than an operation with good quality control and safety measures.

Large fast food operations such as McDonalds want virtually identical products every time and this has resulted in cookie cutter production of food instead of the production of cows, chickens, and pigs. Their high demand for identical factory animals has pushed the concepts of mass production feed lots and encourages unsanitary conditions through cost cutting.

There are now patent laws protecting specific strains of seeds which some companies have used to wield virtual monopoly power over farmers. One example mentioned in the documentary is the company Monsanto who controls 90% of all soybean production and forbids farmers from saving seed forcing them to continue purchasing seed from the company. The company resorts to strong arm tactics and regularly sues farmers and seed cleaners to further secure their monopoly under the auspices of protecting their soybean patent.

The government officials responsible for regulating the food industry often have direct ties back to the major companies so there would appear to be a strong conflict of interest in enforcing regulations.

A law called Kevin's law, named after a 2 year old who died following eating hamburger infected with Ecoli, has not become law yet but has had various versions proposed over the past 5 years. If passed this would give the USDA the ability to more closely regulate the meat and poultry industry to reduce pathogens in meat production and potentially shut down plants that breach health regulations. Feel free to contact your congress members to let them know of this proposed law.

As an alternative to mass production, examples of organic farming are presented. The animals are able to interact with each other and walk around freely similar to how they might in the wild. They eat natural foods rather than being force fed corn. A very articulate and humorous farmer name Joel Salatin, owner of Polyface Farms in Virginia, has fully embraced this style of farming and runs a very successful operation. He talks about letting chickens be chickens and allowing the pigness of pigs. Though organic food costs a bit more, proponents say it taste better and is better for the eaters health. Large corporations such as Walmart and Target have begun selling organic food and this will help with economies of scale and cost reduction.

Throughout the documentary I found myself going ""woah, your kidding right?"" I won't say that I'll never eat fast food again or purchase non-organic but it definitely gives pause towards thinking about where the things you're eating come from. I definitely recommend this 90 minute video to everyone wanting a behind the scenes look at the food industry.",1282089600,,4322,5.081805359661495

However, grass-fed ribeye steak is currently $19.99 - $27.99 per pound.  How can I afford that?

So there's a balance between mass production food and price.  Nevertheless, I'll be eating organic grass-fed beef, and if I can only afford grass-fed ground beef, so be it.  But we need to vote for healthier and more humane food through our purchases.

By the way, most people only think of ""organic"".  There's a few more things that we need to think about as consumers of food:

1.  Organic (this only means that non-organic pesticides and fertilizers are **reduced**)
2.  Locally grown
3.  Non-GMO
4.  Non-irradiated
5.  Grass or pasture fed, if meat

The ominous revelation of one multi-national company taking control of all the seeds in the world and crushing anyone who stands in their way is breath-taking. The callous disregard of small children dying of e-coli in favor of relaxed inspections and regulations for the sake of profits is painfully shown through the eyes of a conservative Republican mother turned food safety activist. All it took for her was the death of her two-year old son to learn the hidden story.

Definitely it educates the consumer about how what they eat is produced. The good as well as the not so good sides of it. I used this DVD in my class to generate a discussion about the highly commercialized agriculture vs less commercialized agriculture. We all know that it's a challenge for a farmer or an agricultural operation to produce a product economically and efficiently with low cost and deliver it in the marker for a profit. This DVD deals with producing something faster, cheaper, in bulk and deliver it to the consumer oftentimes compromising environmental sustainability and consumer health. On the other hand, it also gives a great picture about how some other small scale agricultural businesses are done taking care of aforementioned problems. It also speaks well to the food safety related issue that is very important in the current time as we see a lot more plant and animal related products are being recalled than it used to be.

3866622,5,B0027BOL4G,"Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes with your food before it reaches your plate? While most of us might not realize exactly what goes into our food, or at times not even think about it. But director Robert Kenner and his production team seek to bring out the truth about what goes on behind the scenes of the food industry and make it transparent so we all know the truth about what goes into our food so we can make more decisions about what we put into our body.

There's a lot of mystery in what goes on with our food. Whether it's ingredients we have no idea what they are, or whether it's the general process through which our food goes through, there's a lot that we don't know. The food industry hasn't really helped us in finding out either. Shrouding the farms that work for major industry markets in secrecy, and restaurant chains fighting tooth in nail to avoid giving us nutritional values for the meals we eat it seems as though the food industry as something to hide.

As depicted in Food, Inc. the food industry does have a lot to hide. Not only do the ingredients that go into our food seem less than savory, but their deplorable treatment of stock animals, farmers, and workers are enough to make anyone sick to their stomach. The filmmakers don't just attack their query though, they try to present both sides of the story from the consumer to the market leaders, unfortunately in the case of the market leaders they more often than not decline to be interviewed. And while this documentary might not answer all of our questions about the food industry, it definitely does a great job at helping us realize that things must change.

In the end Food Inc. doesn't just tell us about our food, but how the industry has changed things in America altogether. From appointed government officials who formerly worked for big name corporations and have influenced legislation on their behalf, to the food industry's influence on illegal immigration this film approaches all aspects of the trade. I highly recommend this film, not only to open your eyes to what your eating, but to help you understand how and why things need to change.

I already buy organic meat, chicken, milk, etc. but I am taking it to a whole other level after seeing this video.  It makes you look at the products in the store without the rose-colored glasses.

I'm also so glad I watched this and learned about the horrible treatment of the people that work for these companies and the horrible treatment of the farmers! These companies need to be held accountable for their actions.",1275782400,,547,4.561224489795919
3866624,1,B0027BOL4G,"I enjoyed Eric Schlosser's book FAST FOOD NATION, so I thought I would enjoy this.  Wrong.  That book was coherent, entertaining, and reasonably well-argued.  This one jumps from point to point without giving time to contradictory viewpoints, or even acknowledging they exist.  I couldn't even get through the title sequence without yelling at the screen.

These are not in any particular order:

First of all, showing animals slaughtered is not an argument.  It never seems to occur to the filmmakers that many people are already aware that the animals they eat live short, awful lives in dark, cramped quarters -- and yet have no problem with it.  It was as though the mere sight of animals being butchered was going to be enough to put one off one's meat, but this is not the case for many people.

Second:  the filmmakers look at data points only, not broad society-wide statistics.  The tale of the young boy dying from a freak outbreak of E. Coli was just that:  freak.  The movie made it seem like thousands and thousands are dying.  You're telling me that a billion-dollar industry needs to be shut down because of freak outbreaks now and then?

Third:  never seems to occur to the filmmakers that the USDA might have some reasons for some of its requirements.  Take the prohibition against preparing meat in the open air.  It seems to me that one possible reason for this stricture might be, uh, flies and the effects of sunlight on raw meat.  But oh no!  The USDA is presented as a evil troll who hates sunlight and open air merely because it hates all joy and life.

Fourth:  There was a boatload of irrelevant arguments thrown into this movie.  Am I supposed to feel guilty eating a cheeseburger because workers are forced to ""do the same task again and again""?  Sheesh.  Welcome to the modern world!  That's how things are on my job, which has nothing to do with food.  And what about this:  the way the food is manufactured, we are told, has implications for ""how corporations see other cultures.""  How is this relevant?  I don't care!  Corporations have always seen other cultures as resources to be exploited:  that's just in the nature of a corporation.  Even Apple, the darling company of liberals everywhere (bafflingly, to me), has no problem setting up grim factories in China, then selling the wares in shops in Riyadh.

Fifth:  Does it ever occur to the filmmakers that if they got everything on their wish list, the population of the earth would have to decrease by a few billion?

Sixth:  According to the filmmakers, if you are fat, that's not because you have no self-control:  it's because these evil conglomerates cleverly design food intended ""to press our evolutionary buttons.""  Thus, we're helpless!  Okay, let's take this reasoning over the area of women dressing.  Nearly every day I see women walking down the street in mini-skirts and high heels and think, boy, I'd like to hit that.  Why, the way she's dressing is pressing my ""evolutionary buttons.""  So does the responsibility lie with me to control my urges, or her . . . to veil?

Seventh:  This film was the first I had ever heard of ""food libel laws.""  I did some looking into them, as the way the film characterized them struck me as fishy.  You can't criticize a cheeseburger in Colorado?  That didn't sound right.  No, what it turns out to be is you can't make unsubstantiated claims about food being harmful and cause food industries and workers millions of dollars unless you can substantiate your claims.  If you can, though, it sure as shootin' is legal.  What you can't do is simply fire off wacky, unprovable accusations and send everybody into a panic.  In this way, the food libel laws, where they exist, are similar to libel laws against humans:  you ARE CERTAINLY ALLOWED TO SAY NEGATIVE THINGS in a public forum as long as they are a matter of public record or can be backed up.  The filmmakers absurdly moaning that ""you can't criticize food"" is misleading:  they are deliberately conflating the idea of CRITICISM with UNFOUNDED ASSERTIONS.  Many, since the establishment of food libel laws, have since pointed out all sorts of stuff about what's in the food we eat without getting into hot water BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO BACK UP THEIR CLAIMS.  That lady interviewed on screen obviously couldn't, so, without knowing much more about her situation, I can only assume it was a good thing that she was gagged.  There's more, though:  the ""food libel laws,"" whether just or injust, must be a good deal weaker than the filmmakers characterization of them.  After all, this very film was replete with unsubstantiated accusations and yet I actually bought this DVD in Colorado.

Having said all this, I do agree with some of the some of the movie's points:  agricultural subsidies are a cancer on the economy and yes, our food is too cheap and its price needs to rise so that the full social cost of living as we do can be clearly apprehended.  But when it comes to those points, I came to be convinced of them from reading other sources, not from seeing the arguments in this film.

Wouldn't it be great if the DVD makers were forced to release this film with a commentary track with a couple of tech guys from the USDA responding to what you're seeing on the screen?",1275696000,126,5271,4.685589519650655

3866638,5,B0027BOL4G,"This is a must watch for everyone in America who eats meat. It's really a disgust to see the other side of our food supply controlled by I'm sure a few LARGE businesses. My wife and I now buy very little meat from Wal-Mart and the grocery Store. We bought a deep freezer and got on the internet and to out surprise there was several people in a thirty mile radius of us in the same movement we wanted to head and we found local beef, pork and chickens we now purchase. We have shopped around some and already found prices comparable to Wal-Mart prices too. We found a lady who sells eggs for a dollar a dozen all we want. We just bought three quarters of a cow at four dollars a pound of edible meat and when you average ground beef all the way up to sirloins and t-bones I'd say that was a pretty good bargain.

Use common sense and research around starting with this movie. Then use common sense and tell yourself your body can't take all these antibiotics and hormones they pump full in your food supply just to get it raised faster and bigger all for one purpose to them - to make more money. Don't take my word for it and maybe this movie won't even convince you but please don't just call it a conspiracy theory and blow it off like I've already had family members and friends do to me.

First, after watching this, I'm glad I don't like beef because I definitely wouldn't after this. The food industry is another example of corrupt big business takeovers, which is pretty much in every industry. Actually, it's kind of frightening that, not only can someone patent a seed, if that plant's seed spreads into your land through natural means (you know, like the way seeds spread for millions of years before humans started playing around with them), you can still get into trouble and the burden of proof seems to be on you as the accused...so much for the constitution but we know how much that means in this day and age anyway (i.e. the Patriot Act amongst others, go ahead and check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-End-of-America-Director-s-Cut/dp/B001IX4CC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The End of America: Director's Cut</a>, that's another disturbing one).

After watching this, I almost want to just start hunting and growing my own food except that a big corporation may come in and accuse me of patent theft somehow and force me to hire some high priced lawyer to prove my innocence. All that said, this is a real eye opener and I think everyone in America should watch it.",1273795200,,1338,5.28169014084507

3866719,5,B0027BOL4G,"This award-winning documentary along with the documentary ""King Corn"" had a profound effect on me and has permanently changed my lifestyle and diet. I am not a counter-culture, idealistic college student--I am a retired college professor who was in the health professions my entire career. What has happened to our food supply as a result of providing ""abundant cheap food"" in the U.S. since 1973 is eyeopening and a wake-up call to each of us regarding what we eat and support through our food dollars as individuals and as a nation. ""Our bodies are not just what we eat but what we eat, eats"". The control of U.S. agriculture by a very few large agribusiness companies; limiting the number of crops grown and varieties; the modification of seeds and trademarking life forms has implications that could prove diasterous not only to us but the entire world's food supply.

Organic foods and sustainable farming offers people an option to purchase and eat foods which are not loaded with pesticide and herbicide residues; to eat and drink dairy products, eggs and meat animals that are not loaded with growth hormones to spur production and to put weight on quickly to maximize profits of the huge companies; to decrease the potential of causing ""superbugs"" resistant to antibiotics caused by the administration of continuous antibiotics to keep food animals alive under unnatural and horrific conditions being fed #2 field corn (which they would never eat if allowed a normal life before slaughter for food.) Cattle evolved to eat grass, not grain and the effects on the animal are known but ignored--our beef today contains only 60% of the protein it contained in the mid 1950s thanks to meat packers wanting the highly marbled (read fat)beef. Fish farmers are even trying to get salmon and tilapia to accept #2 field corn feed. The high fructose corn syrup and other products from #2 field corn are in almost all of our grocery products on the market--even those items we do not think of as being sweet. I no longer wonder why people have such a hard time losing weight when most of us eat a diet loaded with hormones given to animals to put on weight quickly and high fructose corn syrup in almost everything we eat.

The U.S. government does not allow genetically-modified food to be labelled; as a result a number of European countries will no longer import certain foods from the U.S. since they require the labelling of genetic modification to grains, fruits and vegetables.  No one (no one) knows the long term effects of using bacteria and viruses to introduce foreign genes from other species into food we eat.

The health risks and costs of ""abundant cheap food""---what it has done to small family farms that did not go along with big agribusiness practices; the requirement of more and more pesticides which may be partially responsible for the abandonment of hives and death of thousands of our pollinators esp. the honey bee. Principles of organic farming which enriches the soil, is better for the farmer, farm animals and us is more expensive than what most of us have been eating everyday.  As a consumer and someone concerned about the implications of standard, modern agricultural practices, I am willing to pay more for the farmer to farm organically--I support fair-trade and believe the farmer and his family need to be to support themselves and their way of life.

As a result of the documentaries my diet is now as much organic as possible; I no longer eat beef, pork, chickens, dairy or eggs produced by the big food processors. I now read labels on the food products I buy to make sure I am not ingesting sweeteners made from #2 field corn. I try to buy wild, Alaskan salmon rather than farmed or Atlantic salmon. I believe my diet is now more nutritious and tastier than ever before.

However, we both agreed afterwards that the movie was actually pretty boring. It just didn't have that ""pop"" that I expect from a good documentary. I wasn't horrified by the conditions in the various slaughterhouses, I wasn't surprised that a big company like Monsanto would find a way to protect their intellectual property rights, I wasn't surprised that corn is in a lot of foods. What I was surprised by, though, was that the insane and environmentally INCORRECT use of corn to make ethanol wasn't even brought up when they talked about corn. Why wasn't that even mentioned? Using corn to make ethanol has raised the price of food, is worse for the environment than just plain gas when a spill occurs, and in the long run does more harm than good to our environment.

I also have the book and am hoping that the book is better than the movie. I expected that after seeing this, I'd want to change my eating habits, but it didn't have that effect on me at all. maybe the book will.

However, the makers of ""Food, Inc."" should have been more graphic in portraying the cruelty to animals. They should have made camouflaged, concealed cameras to make secret videos inside of the slaughterhouses, just like the makers of ""The Cove"" did.

I was also pretty upset about how some of these workers are being treated.  My favorite part was the small sustainable farmer in Virgina.  He was so right, if we were willing to pay a little more for the food that we put in our bodies, we could go to that type of farming for most of the country.  I felt so bad for the mom who lost her 2 year old son.  As a mother of an almost two year old, it makes me think twice about what I may buy at the grocery store or what I give her when we eat out.  It is amazing to think that we may complain about the cost of meat (especially boneless chicken breasts) yet stock up on cans of soda which are 4 for $10.  Overall, this was a very eye opening movie that I think everyone should see.  It wasn't enough to make me go vegetarian, but enough to change the way I purchase food.

3866759,4,B0027BOL4G,"This is the first time I'm reviewing a product - ever. I had resisted watching this documentary for a long time as I thought it would be biased, in-your-face and gruesome. In fact, it was well organized, balanced and insightful. After watching this, I realize that I can make some small adjustments in my own life. Not only to be socially responsible, but also, for my own health.

I will not get into how sad or heartbreaking it is to see the animals suffer. Hopefully, we can all agree that at some level, suffering solely for the sake of greater profits in just not humane.

However, on a practical or even selfish level, it is not in anyone's interest to see our food source be controlled by a handful of corporations. If profit is the main goal, and power is concentrated in the hands of so few (corporate big heads who don't see or live with the consequences of their decisions), then you end up with policies like cleaning your food products with ammonia or ecoli in your ground meat. The fact that a family of 4 can more easily fill up at their local fast food joint (under $12) rather than buy vegetables at their local supermarket or that local farmers are so dependent (and indebted) on their corporate customers indicate there are deep rooted issues with long-lasting consequences.

However, as the film makes clear, consumers do have a voice by choosing to buy certain items (i.e. organic, locally produced, free range chickens, grass fed cows etc.) because this translates into profit and profit talks. I would recommend this film to everyone.",1271635200,,1557,4.695970695970696
3866760,5,B0027BOL4G,"This video was so thought provoking.  So few of us have a good idea where our food comes from or how it was produced.  Most of our nutrition education is limited to TV commercials selling us ""healthy"" fast food or ""natural"" factory-farmed fat-filled meat products.  And then we wonder why America is the fattest country in the world.  It's true that about 1 in 3 American kids born today will end up with Diabetes Type 2 at some point.  DM Type 2 isn't just something annoying that prevents you from eating cookies: it's a terrible disease, a top cause of blindness & amputations, and a very high risk for cardiovascular/HTN problems.  Just like the family in the video illustrated DM Type 2 is very costly to control.  Their medications were ""hundreds"" of dollars a month.  Yet they continue to eat fast-food at most meals.  What they don't understand is that $200-$300 a month goes a long way into buying healthy food choices.  Food can be prepared in advance, then frozen, so time is no excuse.  People just aren't educated on what not to eat.  And when the only ads we see are from big agri-business, no wonder we're confused?

I am deeply troubled by the increasing food industry power.  They've already taken away 1st Amendment rights: it's now illegal to openly discuss food production/industry topics (even if they're TRUE), if the discussion hurts the corporation's sales figures.  How is this even constitutional?  This is the same government who has cut USDA inspections down to a fraction of what they were decades ago, even though population and food intake only goes up.

I also am troubled that in light of the role of lifestyle in health, that nobody is talking about diet during our current healthcare debates.  Why didn't part of the new Health Care bill touch on things brought up in this movie?  And why are my tax dollars being used to provide feed corn to feedlots at below market cost?  Corn has been so cheap that people are even burning it to heat their homes (corn stoves).  How about we stop wasting tax money on corn and if we want to subsidize something that counts, we use it only for healthy food choices such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, foods free of HFCS, non-factory-farmed animal products, etc.

The movie is interesting.  I think if you buy it for your whole family to watch, you won't get bored.  It is thought provoking.

When such services receive any government money (federal, state, local), our tax dollars pay for all or part of the cost of meals for students, hospital patients, soup kitchens, child & adult day care, assisted living, and such. Therefore, FOOD,INC and Jaime Oliver's Food Revolution should be required viewing for: everyone in the food source to consumer chain; and every parent and student grade 4 to post-graduate and in skills training; plus those in government jobs paid directly with public monies (our taxes); and those paid indirectly by a private employer receiving public monies (especially the various education, health and human services). Those that we depend on must have the knowledge to make informed decisions that do not harm us, especially for our children, vulnerable adults and the uninformed.

We need to be a healthy nation again in our persons and our politics. We must end the Republican/Democrat/ Corporate Monopoly. Never vote to reelect or retain anyone.

I bet your State Constitution doesn't have any reelection provisions either. ...""for a term of ___ years"" and ""their successors"" means they may not succeed/follow themselves and are never to hold that position again. Only the President may do it twice in their life. Vice-President may not. ""Running Mate/VP Candidate"" is also unconstitutional. I bet your state primary elections also allow only votes for Republicans and Democrats. Let's restore our Founder's coalition government. So in November general elections vote only for persons that won't accept money from and were never in the Republican/Democrat/Corporate Monopoly. Send the message: we want only true civil servants who work to protect and benefit us then return to private life. Never complain if you vote to reelect/retain again.

3866766,4,B0027BOL4G,"I haven't even seen this movie but I can attest to the fact that slaughterhouses are grim places and the beef industry a sad one, indeed.  After hauling cattle and hogs in a tractor-trailer to these charnel houses I have seen with my own eyes the impersonal, utterly depressing truth of factory farming.  The sweet momma cows who have given up their babies year after year until they can no longer produce 26 gallons of milk per day are then consigned to the hamburger trade.  They load up well since they are used to being handled and their udders, grossly distended from having not been milked in anticipation of slaughter, sway awkwardly.  As a former nursing mom I felt so sorry for this condition which I know from personal experience to be painful!

Sometimes they would go down in transit and the kill plant would chain the cow's legs and drag her off the truck then lift her in the bucket of a front-end loader.  I remember one's udder leaking milk onto the dung-encrusted floor of the trailer ( We clean them but they fill up fast! ) in below-zero temps, leaving a frozen reminder of her service to mankind on the eve of her death.  It seemed obscene to trample the remnant of life-giving milk in the process of unloading the rest of them.

While waiting to unload once I observed the cows go into the building, then somewhere within the next 30 feet behind the closed doors they met their deaths.  Then the bloody hides, so recently clothing a living creature, rose up a conveyor belt and fell in a heap into a dump truck to be taken to a tannery.  Every 40 seconds or so a fresh hide emerged from the building, steaming in the chilly air.  Talk about gluttony!  And all I could think about was the fat, oblivious masses of people gorging on fast food with no thought where it came from.

I no longer eat hamburgers, hotdogs, bologna, or any other kind of processed meat that is ground up and reformed  ( I WILL NOT let my son eat chicken nuggets! ) because the sanitation practices necessary to a wholesome product seem unattainable to me with a workforce whose native language is not English.  The illegal immigrant situation is yet another aspect of this scenario; illegals can be forced to work in hideous conditions for fear of being turned in.  The little Latinas who worked in chicken plants when I hauled a reefer ( That's a refrigerated unit to you stoners out there! ) couldn't believe that a WOMAN was driving a truck all by herself.  When it dawned on them, they invariably burst out in broad smiles.  I hope they saw a way out of an abusive relationship or something by seeing me do that; apparently some illegal men have been known to terrorize their women the way employers terrorize them.

At any rate, the food industry needs to be rethought from top to bottom.  Thomas Jefferson himself envisioned a nation of small-holders,each with his ( or her! ) own farm, each capable of self-sufficiency.  I'll be buying this movie ASAP!",1271462400,2,2954,4.556818181818182

I was shocked,overwhelmed, and saddened by what I saw! I watched this film with my 24 year old daughter, and 26 year old son.

Even back then, there was concerns by the local farmers of the impact of the corporate farm on the food industry. I doubt any of them, however, would have imagined to what extent our Federal Governments would have facilitated the deterioration of public health and food safety in their support of corporate food production, over that of the family farm operation.

On a brighter note, I very much appreciated that there remains a glimmer of hope that we, as consumers, and in cooperation with the dedication and courage of individual farmers who are willing to speak up and return to traditional farming methods and values, have the power to right what has become an unimaginable wrong within North American society.

Yet, even as the documentary shows you the good, the bad, and the ugly of our food industry, they manage to do so in a way that doesn't come off as preachy or condescending.  You journey through several different farms, from huge, stifling factory farms to an ""old-fashioned"" farm where cattle still eat grass and the chickens still see sunlight.  You meet farmers that have been put impossibly deep in debt by the demands of the industry that contracted them, honest people that were prosecuted and denied their livelihood when they committed no crime, and a mother who lost her son to tainted meat and continues to fight for stronger regulation of the industry.  You're shown the facts about where our food comes from, how it's made, and how it reaches us, and at the end there is a very simple message--by shopping smarter and choosing food that has been produced humanely and sustainably, we have the power to change the food industry for the better.

This movie makes a person question the way food products are created and if the FDA is still open for business.

I didn't order the dvd, I watched it online so I won't review the item or shipping, but the movie itself is very informative and scary at the same time.

One reviewer complained about the fact there was no scientific experts. Well, knowing that the FDA had among its members ex-employees from Monsanto or other Companies (who returned working for them), I wouldn't fully trust the experts, unless they are independent, which won't really happen. How independent or free are we? We cannot even know if we're eating meat from cloned animals because the Big Companies don't want to ""scare"" people? We cannot have all the information to make our decision. We cannot even say ""I won't eat this or that"" because the Food Companies can sue anybody because it hurts their business? And what about our health ??

How is soda cheaper than water? How is a burger cheaper than ONE red bell pepper? (hamburger 1$, 1 red bell pepper $1.89 in Houston, and it's not even organic!?).
Where do these E.Coli outbreaks come from? How come cows don't even eat grass anymore? How come the FDA is powerless and cannot event close down a ""factory"" which had E.coli contamination? Why? why? why?

Almost 2 years ago, we watched ""the world according to Monsanto"" and I was disgusted by their way of doing business, hurting financially the farmers, changing our food, the official regulations etc... and so we made some personal changes.

After watching ""Food Inc"", I won't turn vegetarian or ""hippie"" but for sure, I'll pay even more attention to what we eat and how the food is produced. I hope the American People will wake up and fight for the right to have better food and better information, otherwise, I am afraid the next step might be ""soylent green""...",1270684800,,1805,4.7025316455696204

But complain I will.

This ""documentary"" is a brainwash session prepared by and for people who have blinders on. Like any true propaganda film, facts are mixed with inaccuracies and incomplete information, so that the viewer is left with a wrong impression of reality, or an unstated blatant lie.

An example of incomplete information is the treatment of corn, and how it's used by Big Bad Businesses. The movie presents corn as the source of American obesity, without regard to the countless studies that show that primary causes for obesity are a dramatic increase in caloric intake and lack of exercise. The standard applied to causality between corn and obesity is such that one could equally well say that spoons are the cause for obesity in America.

Strangely the ""documentary"" has no actual scientific experts offering opinions, perhaps because such interviews were not deemed necessary, or their content ran contrary to whatever agenda the producers have.

One underlying tone is that Big Bad Corporations are out to get the farmer and the consumer, and that they are enabled by Bad Evil People, such as anyone appointed by President GW Bush. The producers don't seem to find it inconvenient to gloss over the fact that agricultural policies and the Big Bad Corporations depicted go back decades, not just the 8 years from 2001 to 2008, and that appointees of Presidents Clinton and Carter are of necessity engaging in the same Bad Evil activities.

3866837,5,B0027BOL4G,"I was a little surprised that this film didn't focus more on the actual conditions of our factory farms; but then I imagine it's getting ever more difficult for outsiders to get inside these facilities.  What did surprise me was the degree of ruthlessness exhibited by one company in particular - Monsanto.  I realize that companies in general play ""hard-ball"" when it comes to their business practices; but this company has taken that concept to a new high in attempting to corner the soybean market - which it already has about 95% of anyway! It summarily sues any farmer who hasn't bought its genetically altered seeds if any trace of those seeds show up anywhere in that farmer's crop. And, given the nature of the crop pollination process, it's virtually impossible for some of those seeds not to show up in just about every farmer's crop.  Monsanto simply sends its army of lawyers out to shut the independent farmer down - something which, needless to say, the farmer cannot return since, even if some of his seeds show up in the genetically altered crops, he cannot afford such a legal juggernaut.  Another interesting aside concerns one of our Supreme Court Justices, who had once been a Monsanto attorney - and who, instead of recusing himself when a case concerning Monsanto came before the Court, actually wrote the majority opinion!

3866839,5,B0027BOL4G,"I have been aware of Food, Inc. for some time, but watching it kept getting lost in the shuffle.  Now that I've finally watched it, I'm sorry that I let it get lost in the shuffle for so long.  Saying that it is one of the most important films you'll ever watch seems rather bombastic, but I'm serious about that claim.  I had already begun to change my buying habits at the grocery store and to begin to consider what I am putting my body and the bodies of my children, and this film made me more convinced than ever that this is not only the right thing to do, but also the only responsible thing to do.

What was really telling for me was how the major corporations that were examined (Tyson's, Monsanto, etc.) refused to comment on the film.  When we walk into a U.S. grocery store, we have certain expectations about the quality of our foods.  When a film like this starts to poke holes into those illusions, and the major corporations concerned with these products refuse to comment, what should we, as consumers, think of their lack of response?  The current climate in the U.S. has shown us what happens when capitalism is allowed to run amok, when the dollar becomes more important than the person who is holding it.  It's not overstating things to say that what's going on in the food industry right now is every bit as alarming as what was going on in our financial institutions.

I think what this film best illustrates is how our politicians (on both sides of the aisle), our government, and the heads of the departments we've entrusted to ensure our safety (USDA, FDA, et al.) have routinely sold us out for the sake of the almighty dollar.  The production of food has become so industrialized in this nation that the focus has shifted from ensuring safety to turning a blind eye in order to ensure the continued padding of the bottom line.  If Upton Sinclair could see what's going on today, he would despair over how we've learned nothing from his groundbreaking work, ""The Jungle"".

My one issue with this film is its delicate handling of the new organic food industry.  I have switched to buying mostly organic foods, but I often wonder if this really is the solution to the problem, as it claims to be.  As these large organic companies (Stonyfield Farm, anyone?) start to grow to conglomerate status, do we run the risk of finding ourselves right back at square one?  I think the producers should have considered taking a harder look at these companies as well.

Still, this is a film that is essential.  If Americans do not stand up and demand to know where their food comes from, demand to know why current practices are accepted, we all run the risk of a public health disaster.  This may sound dramatic, but one need only look at the rampant e. coli outbreaks to see that the proof is literally in the pudding.  We have grown far, far too complacent about the things we put into our mouths, trusting to regulatory agencies that are no longer operating under the mandate of ensuring public safety.

The best lesson anyone can take from this film is that each and every one of us has the power.  Yes, these are huge corporations that command legions of lawyers and billions of dollars in profits, but where do those profits come from?  If we vote with our wallets, if we refuse to accept the presence of cloned meat and bio-engineered corn products in our foods, these companies will have no choice but to stand up and take notice.  We all need to go to the grocery store, pick up a container, read the ingredients, and walk away from anything that has unnatural ingredients in it. In this way, we can all become agents for the changes we want to see effected.",1269734400,3,3682,4.520361990950226

It helped me make better decisions about food quality and I plan to watch it every now and then to remind me of why I don't eat certain food anymore. I would have given it 5 stars if it were a little faster in its delivery and they probably could've gotten a lot more intense footage if they let people and locations remain confidential.

I wish everyone could see this video so they would know what is being done to make food cheapest and fattest, and what is put into the food that they eat.  I think if the public was more aware of processes and origins of their food, they could make better choices, and vote with their money to buy less factory-like made food until some of these processes and procedures were no longer profitable.

As I watched these factories where animals spend their entire lives packed in so tight to each other that they can hardly move and they hang out all day in their own urine and feces, where it's impossible to clean the waste out due to the packed conditions .... I wondered how in the heck could any of these animals be truly 'healthy', and how does it benefit people to eat an unhealthy animal?  A lot of the animals we eat are sick!  How can that be good???

This movie touches on many problems in our food industry.  For example, genetically modified foods, how we may end up eating cloned animal meat if we don't speak up to congress and the FDA, how there are only a few companies controlling most of the food industry and how that power and money are influencing our government and railroading farmers, and of course, how inhumane these animals, and the workers who process them, are treated.

The most eye-opening things for me were: 1)if you feed cows grass for 5 days, they'll clean themselves of 80% of ecoli bacteria, but instead of doing that, industries ""cleanse"" our meat with AMMONIA, 2)policy makers and judges are not in bed with these corporations, they come straight from these companies to these very important political positions, 3)the USDA no longer has the power to shut down factories who repeatedly have tainted facilities, 4) corporations can now patent life and therefore can sue others for using/reusing their ""seeds,"" and will take farmers who don't use their seeds to court accusing them of this crime just to send a message, and/or to put this farmer out of business and in process these lawyer/companies are able to obtain EVERY BANK TRANSACTION that farmer has made in the past 10 years (I imagine the companies then go after the people with whom the poor farmer/seed cleaner has been in business).

What I found disappointing was the lack of information in this video, but it is a movie, not a mini-series.  As I said, ""it touches"" on these different issues, but there's much more to know - I guess the watcher should be smart enough to do more research and read some books.  I would've like have seen in this video, ""why is corn so harmful to digest by animals AND humans? how can the stress these animals are in, especially before the slaughter, affect us? what happens to these small organic companies who get bought out by corporations but keep their ""organic"" identity? how exactly does a food become ""genetically modified"" and what may be the consequences to our health? how close are we (or are we already there) to having our food come from cloned animals? what other ways is the farmer, who's grass-feeding his beef, helping the environment/ecosystem?  are other countries running their food industry in the same way as us or does the US already control them too? how did Oprah win the fight against these monster food lawyers?

If nothing else, after seeing this video, I want to do MORE than just buy local and/or organic, I want to speak up and speak out against these monopolies and the politicians who support them - why aren't they considered monopolies!?! I like cheap stuff, predictability, and consistency just as much as the next person, but people have to use their head and ask, ""at what cost?""

I've had an allergy to beef for the last 15 years and never knew why.  I am buying grass fed beef now and have yet to have any reaction, which tells me its not beef but maybe the hormones or antibiotics or the ammonia they wash the beef in or maybe the dye they use to make it look red.

3866886,5,B0027BOL4G,"I thought that, considering the food companies themselves were unwilling to be open to scrutiny in this documentary, and present more of their side of the picture, the film managed to be remarkably balanced and objective.  Naturally, it behooves us all to be somewhat aware of the ""factory system"" that is involved with the food that sustains us.  I guess what I find so remarkable is that the system works so well, not that it has failings, considering the level that the U.S. has become dependent on just a few large companies.  On the other hand, the tragedies were also included and put into perspective.  That the system is so large and inflexible that it cannot be corrected when humans or animals are being abused is discouraging.  In getting some feel for the enormity of the food industry, I guess the ultimate question that lurks at the boundaries of this film is whether or not we are getting close to (or perhaps have exceeded) what the ecologists like to call ""carrying capacity"" for population.",1267833600,,1008,4.7701149425287355

3866888,5,B0027BOL4G,"What an eye opening film. I applaud the filmmakers and participants who have told this much needed story. I am upset and disappointed at how these companies, the government, and consumers have allowed creation of scientifically generated foods to land on our tables. We all, at some point, have contributed to this horrible production of food. I believe consumers have had the least involvement in this madness but hold the most power for change, as the film indicates.

The two stories that stood out for me were the mother/daughter team who lost a son/grandson due to E-coli, and the owner of Polyface Farms (I belive his name was Jim). I applaud this mother/daughter team and my heart goes out to their cause. I just loved the enthusiasm and devotion of Polyface Farms to maintain a 'natural' ecological focus for what he produces. Polyface educates us as to the importance of why we should eat organically. And don't forget those GMO's (not associated with Polyface)...you've got to hear about that one!

I was already on course for eating well, but this has just put me over the fence as to why I should eat organically. I could go on and on about this subject but you need to see for yourself and make your own decisions. A MUST SEE. Well done!

We've been moved to eat grass fed beef and organic chicken and eggs, and looking into a local co-op.  I already have been making many things at home to avoid all of those corn based ingredients (it's hard enough to avoid HFCS and sugar!), this just puts us on a faster track to being even more decisive in what products we buy.

3866943,5,B0027BOL4G,"I thought I knew a lot about the subject of food in this country, but this movie really opened my eyes further that I had anticipated.  Most people probably don't even want to watch this movie because they don't want to know the truth, but that's just it - this is our reality and we're kidding ourselves if we stay in the dark.

Anyway, after seeing this movie, I no longer have any desire to eat meat unless I know exactly where it came from and how it was raised, which is really expensive (even in a Northern California, farm town with plenty of sustainable and organic farms).  So, watching this movie has proved the best diet, since I no longer look at food as casually as I once did.

Spoiler Alert! I think the most enlightening part of the movie for me was seeing how skewed our food purchasing system has become that fresh vegetables are more expensive than Sugary soda and hamburgers. Weren't meat and sugar supposed to be the expensive items?  Well they are, but thanks to subsidies, poorer Americans are basically force fed crap until they get diabetes or a heart attack.

Oh, I could go on, just watch the movie, you won't be the same afterwords, but, you owe it to yourself to know the truth.",1267488000,,1207,4.4389140271493215

Its no wonder low income families flock to cheaper CORN-fed, corn-derived foods and skip the vitamin enriched pricey produce.

It is no wonder why so many diseases have taken a hold on our lives. Its truly terrifying to think that something as simple as eating a hamburger can kill you.

3866983,4,B0027BOL4G,"Although highly informative and essential viewing for those interested in where, how and what's going on with the food that lands on their dinner table, FOOD, INC. follows in the footsteps (often lockstep) of another interesting treatise on American corporate food culture,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Future-of-Food/dp/B000V5IOWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Future of Food</a>.

Essentially, The Future of Food focused more directly on the Monsanto Company and how the first patent on a living thing (seeds) has changed the face of agriculture. Food, Inc. similarly rehashes this theme and includes the same information regarding Monsanto's strong arm tactics in keeping their patented seeds out of the hands of farmers who haven't purchased it. The problem, though, is you can't control the wind, and when seeds fall off trucks, or a few fly from one field to another, there's no way farmers can control it. And this is where Monsanto has done the unthinkable: they've built a group of strongmen attorneys to go after those farmers who's crops show Monsanto seeds, but haven't purchased them (nor tried to steal them, I might add). This strong arming has resulted in farmers being dragged through the court system at tremendous expense. And when you're David fighting Goliath, the odds are not in your favor if it takes two years to get to court and your attorney fees begin mounting.

But where we begin to diverge in the two films (The Future of Food versus Food, Inc.) is in the meat department. Food, Inc. delves much more into the problems with the mass production of chickens, beef, and pigs (the three main meat staples) and how we've modified these creatures to fit our increasingly bad appetites and diets. Tyson Foods is one of the largest suppliers of chicken meat (you've probably seen their labels at your local store), but did you know that the chicken you're eating was born, grew and slaughtered in less than three months? And that the chicken you're forking into your mouth right now could probably only stand up, taking two or three steps, then collapse into a panting, feathered heap? Do you know why? Watch this film and learn.

Another alarming trend is in beef industry where cattle are no longer allowed to graze, but are held in pens, wandering around on piles of manure, and being fed corn. Why? Because corn puts weight on much faster, but it also causes certain intestinal bacteria to flourish and, maybe mutate. Want to know why we've had so many E.Coli outbreaks in the past few decades? Watch this film and connect the dots.

The brightest part of this film is that it is NOT anti-meat; it's anti-corporation. Big time. But only when it comes to our food. It wants you to learn why it's so important to shop at your local farmer's market. Why foods that are out of season are out of season FOR A REASON. Why corn has become so pervasive in our diets (and what its doing to our food and, in consequence, to us). Why free-range meat is much better for you (including the bacteria count). It wants to know why you're not asking why.

This is a good eye-opener for those who eat at McDonald's every week (or day) and to those of us who shop at Piggly Wiggly or Safeway. Check out the meat before you bite into it.

Even though Food, Inc. gave some good (but repetitive) information, it was a bit long. I think the film makers could've gotten away with about 15 minutes less time and made it just as effect in getting its message across. Still, I'm looking more closely at my food, which is what they want you to do.",1266883200,,3597,4.850162866449511

The film is biased, when it needn't be, incomplete and poorly executed.  For example, we see the grass farmer slaughtering his chickens, but in the Ominivore's Dilemma, this grass farmer is much more that someone who raises grass-fed chickens.  He raises an entire eco-system, one that should be discussed and promoted.  He also raises cattle and pigs, but his prohibited from slaughtering those animals on his farm.  This is never mentioned.  His story and the way that he farms is so much more interesting than the entire Food, Inc. film.  In so many scenes, I was saying to myself, ""Yes, but . . . ""  Yes, but that thought is incomplete, yes, but you could say so much more, yes, but what about this fact or that fact.  Essentially, Food, Inc. is lazy and superficial in fact and form; it is the People Magazine version of the Omnivore's Dilemma.  It will turn off people who it is meant to appeal to and others will simple render it a poorly done polemic.  A much better film is ""The Future of Food"".",1266883200,72,1158,4.622549019607843

The sordid method of mass production and the repulsive ways used to bring the food to our table as cheap as possible is beyond abomination.  Yes, I knew that mass production requires putting the livestock in large bins. What I didn't know was that overcrowding was to such an extent that animals were living on top of one another. Compassion and the humane treatment should be exercised whenever you are dealing with any livestock.

As our food industry's corporations become more powerful, we come face-to-face with the little guys (small farmers and organic growers) who try to offer the public alternative choices...and how they were met with lawsuits and threats from these corporations.  There's nothing I need THAT BAD where I have to give my business to any company that uses threats!

So now that I have this knowledge, what would I be doing differently? I won't be buying meat packages in bulk from my supermarket, that's for sure. I will be buying organic meat products from now on. Yes, they are more expensive but I'll be buying in smaller amounts. When I prepare meals for my family, it'll be quality over quantity.  And I think that's a very good thing!

If you are interested in this topic, then I also highly recommend ""In Defense of Food"" and ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" by Michael Pollan.

After reading Pollan's books and viewing this documentary, I'm starting to think that the current food crisis (or as Pollan calls it, ""edible food-like substances"") is actually more urgent than climate change (both are urgent, but this food crisis is creating an epidemic of diabetes, obesity, cancer, and more).

It is also outrageous how U.S. policy is helping fuel this crisis.

In short, you are what you eat, and what you're eating right now is pretty disgusting.

3867024,5,B0027BOL4G,"I give this DVD 4 hooves up!.... It's a MUST see if you have any concern for your well being.

As I was watching this thought provoking DVD, deep within my soul I felt saddened and ashamed for knowing that I have contributed to a living hell for so many animals that are factory farmed for my consumption. During the movie, I had an earth shattering revelation that I was a hypocrite... I fight for animals rights and environmental causes, yet I was blindly heading to the market for my families pre-packaged, guilt-free steaks & chicken, and processed foods.

I adore all animals, and I respect their lives. I respect Mother Earth. Yet I ate meat 3-5 times a week, and had no problem serving food from a box. All my life I have been a ""flexitarian"", but this DVD has changed my life and my diet. Actually, it threw me over the edge. I will no longer eat meat washed in ammonia, chickens washed in chlorine, and will no longer eat from a box. How dare these huge corporations think that we are their guinea pigs... willfully feeding cows 28 million pounds of antibiotics a year that end up in our bodies, feeding these animals genetically modified corn instead of grass (or hey), serving the American public ""downed cow"", diseased and sick chickens, who live their entire lives in knee deep feces. Welcome to their science experiment. They do not know the short or long term effect that their practices are having on the American people consuming their products, and knowing that that they don't care is sickening as well. All the information in this DVD should have been available to us consumers years ago. These corporations should have an open door policy and yet they hide and deceive what they are doing with the food products we are sticking in our face. I am now convinced, more than ever, that these corporations are the leading cause of most of our illnesses, and our food addictions. This DVD is your wake up call people. Ask yourself, who is in charge of your life?

Know wonder these Corporation's had ""no comment"" for this documentary and did not want us to see the ugly truth behind their practices... no one in their right mind would think, ""Um Beef... Sounds delicious!"" I am so thankful that the ""veil"" of truth has been removed and now I can actually understand why Americans should eat organic, farm raised, free range, grass fed animals, and buy locally grown fruits and vegetables. I really get it now!

This DVD will make you sit and wonder; How could all this be true?, How could ""they"" allow this to go on?, Where are the food police?, and Does any one respect LIFE anymore? Is it all about the money for these corporate giants?... the answer to that one is easy to answer after viewing this wonderfully made DVD. Thank you Michael Pollan for helping me remove my blinders.",1264982400,2,2798,4.59
3867025,5,B0027BOL4G,"An excellent film that kept us interested all the way through, except I feel too much time was spent on the woman who lost a child and we fast forwarded through some of that.  I am sorry for her loss but it just dragged on too long.  My skeptical husband since bought the DVD and has been passing it around to friends, who now want me to raise all their chicken and pork for them :-D

Unlike PETA films this one does not try to gross you out and make you a vegetarian.  There are a few short graphic scenes but rather than try to sicken you, the message they are trying to get across is how a handful of Big Ag companies control over 80% of America's food supply, and how politically powerful and nearly untouchable these companies are.  It all seems very bleak, but at the end you are told how you can get better control of your own food supply... for example raise whatever you can, buy direct from the farmer at the farm or at farmers' markets, at the very least eat simpler and make as much as possible from scratch and fresh foods rather than buying prepackaged, highly processed foods.

One point I would like to make about the chickens is that they are not ""forced"" to grow unnaturally fast as some reviewers say... they have been BRED to grow that way.  I grow the same chickens, Cornish Cross broilers, in my ""back yard"" (we have 10 acres).  Mine spend the first three weeks in the brooder til they are feathered out, and in addition to meat bird starter get hand pulled clover and grass with dirt and roots, as well as all the fine hay bits leftover from feeding other animals.  After moving to pasture pens I cut their high-powered Meat Grower feed with 25% plain scratch because in my first batch, before I cut the feed, I did have a few keel over from congestive heart failure from too-rapid growth.  They also get moved to fresh grass 2-3x daily.  No problems with the next two batches -- I ordered 75 chicks and was shipped 79 (a good hatchery always includes a few extras) in those batches and had only 3 die, and those within the first few days, weak ones/shipping stress.  I butchered from 6 to 8 weeks of age and while I did not weigh them, visually they were almost all larger than the storebought birds which are usually 3-1/2 to 4 lbs.  In fact some were Godzilla chickens, about 8-10 lbs!

I love meat and will never be vegetarian unless I am forced to it.  Some people will take this movie as a call to vegetarianism.  I see it as a reason to buy your food direct from the farmer who grows it, one who allows you to visit the farm personally and see how it is raised.  ""Organic"" simply means the animal was fed organically-grown feed.  The animals can still be raised in terrible conditions and their meat labelled ""Organic"".  ""Cage Free"" and ""Free Range"" does not mean the birds are happily running around a pasture... it can mean there are still hundreds or thousands crowded at a square foot per bird into buildings, with all their food,water and shade inside so even if there is one small door to the ""free range"" outside they are likely not going to use it.

I want to know how my meat was raised and how it died and was processed.  I am lucky in that I can raise and home butcher my own pork and chicken and buy my beef from a friend who raises her animals the same way I do.  Many cities are allowing folks within the city limits to keep chickens, so anyone can now keep their own for eggs or meat.  My own town has no regs against livestock at all and I know a man in the middle of town who raised a pig in his back yard last year.  He does have a large lot and kept the pen scrupulously clean so the neighbors would not have any complaints about smell.  Laying hens and meat birds make a lot less noise than your average dog.  Just don't keep any roosters to avoid annoying the neighbors (with meat birds sex doesn't matter, they are butchered long before they begin crowing).",1264896000,3,3909,4.298772169167804

Not any more.  My family and I are transitioning over to a non-industrialized diet after watching Food, Inc.  This goes beyond buying organic.

3867045,5,B0027BOL4G,"That a movie has to be made to inform the American public where food comes from is a remarkable testament to how much life has changed in the past century.

Michael Pollun makes this point about his book, The Omnivore's Dilemma, but it applies equally well to this 2008 film from Emmy award-winning producer/writer/director Robert Kenner.  Food, Inc presents little revelatory to those interested in issues of health, environment, food safety, or animal welfare.  What it does well is pull together many of these strands to weave an informative, non-polemical, and visually captivating introduction for the many millions not yet aware of the hidden costs of the modern food industry.

Early on in the film an agricultural engineer asks, what's wrong with maximizing yield?  The answer is found in the many stories that follow but is summarized best by a free range rancher who observes that if the meat packing industry treats animals as little more than commodity, if it treats them as nothing more than a package of protein to be manipulated for profit, then it is most unlikely these same companies, these same people, have more benign or even enlightened attitudes towards employees or customers.

The CEO of Stonyfield offers a way forward that balances yield with stewardship, commerce with compassion.  A lot of his like-minded friends are aghast at his ""collusion"" with the corporate enemy, but he reminds them that because Wal-Mart customers buy his yogurt, that much less pollution is prevented from entering the environment.  Wal-Mart officials confirm they began selling organic yogurt because of consumer demand.

One aspect of the fuller story depicted only indirectly is the effect US companies and government have on food economics, policies, and consumption in countries beyond its borders.  It's not just the American consumer that is getting screwed.  Waistlines and diabetes are increasing in countries to which US-style fast-food, commercial food products, and food business models are exported.  It also fails to mention the simplest solution for reducing greenhouse gases, deforestation, food borne illness, suffering of sentient beings, and hunger - eating more plants and eating less meat.

This film also sheds light on how our fast food world has changed the entire food industry.  It is really true that everytime we make a purchase at the grocery store we are essentially placing a vote.",1263859200,4,418,4.253164556962025
3867047,5,B0027BOL4G,"Ignorance really is bliss.  I was aware, to an extent of how inhumane animals were treated.  I was aware of Monsantos evil ways.  But this movie still packed enough of a punch and forced me to open my eyes a little more.  Actually seeing the conditions of the animals THAT WE EAT, before they are slaughtered was just sad.  The people that work for these companies treat their employees the same way.  These are people that probably have no morals of any sort, nor do they value the human life.  It's disgusting.  After years of evolution and working hard to create rights and laws, people are still working in deplorable conditions.  Seriously, is any of this necessary, except for big monopolies to pad their pockets?

Of course it's pro-organic, but do you really want to eat a chicken that is living in so much filth that it's fed antibiotics its entire life?  Do you want a chicken that is loaded with growth hormones?  How about a cow that's stuck in a pen on top of thousands of other cows, eating a diet of genetically modified corn and then killed inhumanely?  We should all be forced to think about what we eat and try and take action against what's really going on.  I think this country needs an overhaul of the system.  I think it needs to just blow up (come to a head), so we can go back to simpler times.

I'm glad this movie focused on the subject at hand, without using gore and blood.  If you want to see that, go watch an action flick.  And for those that say it's biased and one sided.

3867051,2,B0027BOL4G,"From the preview, I thought this film was going to be a bit more encompassing, since ""documentary"" somewhat implies an objective and fairminded analysis.  However, this was mostly a one-sided (from the liberal perspective) demonization of the timeworn target, the ""large multinational corporation"".  That's not to say the ""one side"" doesn't have a few good points, such as the excessive heavy-handedness of a few big companies in their attempt to legally bully the smaller, independent agricultural farmer or worker.

  Where the movie got somewhat off track, however, was with the myopic viewpoint that all non-organic large-scale consolidation and mechanization of the agricultural/food industry is evil and contrary to the well-being of our planet and its citizens.  In fact, the mass production techniques in effect today, as well as genetic food engineering, are primarily responsible for allowing smaller parcels of arable land to feed ever-increasing world populations -- and the paramount reasons that the USA has become the world's breadbasket in times of peace and catastrophe (do you see any other countries shipping huge amounts of foodstuffs to the recent Haitian disaster sites?).

To cast a pall of Maximum Evil onto the large food producers, the film made liberal use (no pun intended) of the mechanism of scrolling "">>>insert food corporation's name here<<< DECLINED TO BE INTERVIEWED FOR THIS FILM"" past your view screen. Although a somewhat passe technique, if they truly wanted to include a voice from the ""other side"", the producers COULD have obtained the countervailing viewpoints from the established industry spokespersons -- such as the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the US Poultry & Egg Association, etc.

  And of course, no left-slanting film would be complete without your hearing the mantra of ""global warming"" a time or two -- despite that concept becoming more laughable with every passing day as newer, more accurate revelations leak out from the true scientific community (those not yet corrupted by ""climate politics"" and its money-driven propaganda machine).  I guess the producers didn't get the memo yet: they're now supposed to call it ""climate change"", since the phrase ""global warming"" no longer even passes the giggle test.

  All in all though, this film was (barely) worth the .99 cent weekend rental price -- that is, if you haven't explored this subject matter previously.  Otherwise, the film is far too weak on content -- no matter which side you're on -- to be a ""buy"".",1263513600,20,2528,5.285
3867052,5,B0027BOL4G,"My expectation of this film was that it would be more or less a compilation and reinforcement of information I had gleaned from having seen the eye-opening film ""Fast Food Nation"" several years ago, and having just finished reading the excellent books ""Animal,Vegetable Miracle"" and ""In Defense of Food"" among others. However, this film is more than the sum of those books and that movie.

 Food Inc. is an extremely well made documentary in part because of the personal stories told by interviewees, as well as the hidden camera footage. I was especially impressed by what's happening to farmers.

The material is so well investigate and presented. Multiple aspects of food production, marketing and consumption are covered. There is no ""time out"" in this movie, it's one hit after another. All shocking and important information we citizens need to be concerned about.

3867054,5,B0027BOL4G,"I thought I knew a lot about nutrition and the food that I eat, but there were some things in this documentary that surprised even me.  I think one of the most eye opening things about it was in the beginning where they show aisles and aisles of supermarket space all filled with a seemingly endless variety of foods.  But as the movie continues you come to find out that there are very few different ingredients in all of these foods, a high percentage of it is corn, soy and chemicals.  After watching it, I looked at the labels in my local grocery store and was amazed at how true that is.

The one argument in favor of processed foods in my mind was that there's more of a variety than the whole natural foods that my family normally eats.  Sometimes it's hard to be creative without resorting to processed ingredients, but maybe that's just laziness on my part.  After watching this and seeing not only the origin of some of the foods we eat, but the social and environmental implications of foods we purchase, I can see that it's worth it in so many ways to go out of my way to buy only whole, unprocessed foods.  The extra money spent on organic is well spent.  We need to start voicing our opinions with what we spend our money on because according to this film, that's the only voice we have.

Coincidentally, I just finished reading a techno-thriller novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freedom-TM/dp/0525951571/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freedom (TM)</a>&nbsp;that has parts that tie into this same subject, people taking back the right to a clean and safe food supply.

3867059,5,B0027BOL4G,"It's a challenge to present a difficult subject matter, one infused with so much political fire, in a respectful and straightforward way. Food Inc. does the job perfectly. It isn't preachy, it isn't blasting viewers with gory sights from slaughterhouses, it isn't one-sided; what it does is share important information in a way that lets viewers see behind the scenes of big agriculture, behind the marketing and the hype.

Often, books and movies on this subject are preaching to the choir. The only folks that see or read the message didn't need the message in the first place. Food Inc. is mainstream, accessible and open to everyone. Food, our health and our land shouldn't be an issue for the Left or the Right. It impacts all of us equally and the solution has to involve all sides. Small farmers have a big stake in this, as do those concerned with the environment, food safety advocates, workers' rights defenders and average consumers. Everybody has a piece of this pie and how we choose to go forward is what will matter. Food Inc. gives the viewer plenty of food for thought but also some conclusions that can be implemented now by consumers to help bring big business in line with what is safe and healthy.

Skeptics especially should watch this film. If you don't believe there is anything wrong with genetically modified food, with huge agricultural factories, with our current food safety, then watch this film and put your thoughts and beliefs up against the information presented. If nothing else, I think skeptics will get the chance to see things from another view point and perhaps walking a mile in those boots will give them some food for thought too.",1262649600,4,1673,4.805555555555555

Things like the soy bean market being cornered by Monsanto and the stripping of the powers of the FDA are shocking! And those are only two of the long series of issues that this film illuminates.

I'd never read any of the books that are cited in this film, but love a good documentary (via Netflix streaming,) and when this one showed up with high ratings I had to watch it. What I found was a documentary that shows just how ignorant we Americans are. I know that after watching this film I am going to pay far closer attention to where my food comes from and buy local when I can.

3867062,5,B0027BOL4G,"I just received the DVD in the mail and finished watching it.  This is simply outrageous and incredible.  One would think that this sort of irresponsible corporate behavior only happened in the 3rd world.  WRONG! This is happening right here in our backyard.  I am indeed surprised that Monsanto, Perdue and others have not silenced Eric Schlosser or managed to ban the DVD.

It seems that human beings NEVER LEARN.  Throughout human history there have been numerous empires, a search in WIKI with the word ""List of empires"" will produce a huge list.  Each of them thought they will be around forever.  However, if someone in this century can name even five of those long gone empires, I would be impressed!  The point I am trying to make is that human greed that drives these sort of practices can never last.  Granted it will do a lot of damage until it is expunged, but its days are numbered.

Ask any student in high school these days, if they have heard of IBM and you will probably get a blank look.  The same would be the case for General Dynamics and a host of other big behemoth corporations which have all been reduced to the status of ""Also ran!""  The point I am driving at is that longevity and artificially created monopolization do not mix well.  They may appear to be winning for a time, but in retrospect it is always for a short duration.

I always maintain that we do not need an external power to destroy us, because we will destroy ourselves through greed!  What Al Qaeda was unable to do, namely dismantling the economy of this great nation, was almost suceesfully accomplished by the ""All American"" big corporations such as, Lehman Bros., AIG, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Citi Corp etc

Likewise Monsanto, Perdue, Tyson, Con Agra, BPI, IBP, Smithfield and the others in the film, along with the Healthcare (Hospitals and Doctors) corporations will send everyone to an early grave through lots of suffering.  However, hopefully sooner rather than later, the public will wake up and cry, ""Enough!""

This film must be shown 24/7 on cable networks, made available in schools, libraries, gym, etc.  Anyone who has children must make them watch this film so that they are made aware of the consequences of what they put into their mouths.

For those who are open to advice from a stranger, I suggest that they clean out their colon, eat raw living foods (sprouts, green smoothies, wheatgrass juice, fruits, seeds, uncooked food etc) and do LOTS of yoga.  This is the way to a disease free life with minimum impact upon the environment and resources -- land and human suffering.  This will also help reduce the cost of health care tremendously.  Most importantly it will produce health and happiness in the lives of everyone who follows the advice.  Any  disease, manifested or gestating or seemingly incurable, will be healed.  This is my greatest learning in the 51 yrs I have been on this planet!  Please take action for your health while you still can.  Once you slip into the jaws of the mega corporations through eating the manipluated and poisoned food, or by being operated upon by the modern butchers of medicine (doctors), it may be too late to recover from a fate worse than death!

Here is another DVD that I place in the same stellar league as this one.  The name is ""Healing Cancer"".  Even though the title implies that it deals with cancer alone, in reality the methods therein are generic enough to apply to all diseases -- chronic, degenerative and terminal.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Healing-Cancer/dp/B0016K3EMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Healing Cancer</a>",1262217600,,3637,4.911475409836066

As powerful and alarming as ""Food, Inc."" is, it's still probably too tame and restrained to convey just how horrendous our food system is. This really needs to be a 10 hour series that goes into extreme depth and detail, and is shown in every school and to every congressperson. I have tried to stop eating meat ever since I traveled through Texas cattle country 20 years ago. It's a scene as bad as any from Nazi Germany, the cattle pens resemble bleak concentration camps. And the stench is so extremely foul, it hits you many miles down the road, and then it stays with you for days, and weeks. A nightmare. I say I've tried to stop eating meat, but I am not perfect and have my weak moments. I eat much less meat than most people, and that's good, but I can do better. The big problem is that it's not just meat that's causing so much damage to our society. It's corn syrup and soy products, which are in nearly everything we consume. Even Batteries! So it's more than a little frustrating and confusing. There are a few good answers and positive ideas presented here, but we need more and we need 'em Fast. Technically, the film is superbly made, covers a very wide spectrum of the condition, and manages to not leave me feeling too hopeless and depressed. I do that fine all by myself. So, even though I don't think it goes nearly far enough to make us, all of us, realize that our Doom and Demise is accelerated by our irresponsible and inhuman food choices, I highly recommend ""Food, Inc.""",1261094400,,1556,4.425087108013937

buying from local farms, caring about what we eat and how it is raised,
demanding that our grocery stores carry acceptable brands, and by letting policy

But this is just the wake-up call that our increasingly obese nation needs.  This is not a  ""conspiracy theory"" documentary, though I've heard it called this.  It is simply a documentary about the damage wrought on our food industry by big business supplying exactly what America demands--cheap, abundant food.

I know our meat sources don't exactly come from good places but like a lot of people I just wanted to turn a blind eye. Just give me my meat and be quiet.
So after some hard thinking I decided to watch ""Food Inc."" and I think I can sum up the movie and the meat industry in one word.
EWWWWWWWWWWW!!!

I won't go into great detail as to what the movie involves; other reviewers have done that already and done it well.

What did I like about the movie?
Everything!
I think I'm ready to start ordering my meat through an organic farmer; I don't want all those chemicals and hormones going through my body or my families.
The movie is well shot, well written, and very informative.
Eye opening and flat out disturbing.
Why is the food industry doing this to us?
Why are they doing such terrible things to the animals?
What are they doing?
Watch the movie and find out.
It's sad, I almost had to turn the movie off after the story of the two year old and E Coli.
What else did I like?
I can't believe I'm saying this about a documentary but I loved the music too.
Great acoustic guitar in certain spots.

What didn't I like?
Nothing.
This movie is as perfect as a documentary can be.
If you're at all curious as to where or meat is REALLY coming from and if you think by not eating meat that you're any safer, THINK AGAIN.
You owe it to yourself and your loved ones to watch this movie.
Get informed and take action.

3867089,5,B0027BOL4G,"By focusing on food this movie goes behind the curtain of Oz to lift the veil and reveal a privitized government of, for, and by corporations. In the food industry they literally own the patent rights to the seeds(read Seeds of Destruction by William F. Engdahl). They(a few monopolies) own the whole food process from seeds to the supermarkets/restaurants. Not only do they own the govrnments regulators/they are the government regulators, not only in the food industry, but the banking industry, the pharmaceutical, the media, you name it/it's been privitized to monopoly ownership. Even the U.S. Government has been privitized through a lobbied/corporate media electoral 2-party dictatorship.
This movie is unfortunately just the tip of the titanic ice berg that is not melting but ready to produce another titantic ""bubble"" called ""Cap and Trade"".
 Tune In & drop out of the mainstream propaganda and start reading from a variety of sources. The more mainstream/government, the more suspect.
 By virtue of the fact that this movie has been made and distributed widely speaks of the real hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel. The more that people search for that light the more there will be for us all. Truth may be slow, but it is more powerful than the privitized lie. The Public may be Privitization's enemy # 1, but the truth is racing to beat...monpolies/oligopolies lies that race around the world many times over before truth can even tie it's shoe strings.

3867093,3,B0027BOL4G,"I found the film to be interesting and worth watching.  Parts of it were truly eye opening.

On the other hand there seemed to be an underlying political message beyond food.

Some of this message may have been inadvertent bias of the typical pro organic crowd being interviewed such as reference to global warming and opposition to profits.

But some issues were repeated throughout the film and obviously the view of the producers.  This centered around pro-union anti free market labor along with the assumption that anything that increases production or lowers cost is automatically bad.

What I took away from the film is that the food industry is ruled by a few large companies that wield monopolistic market power and have armies of lawyers and lobbyists that are able to sue and intimidate the little guy an buy favorable treatment in the making of laws and regulation of the industry.

The inevitable solution presented was to vote with your wallet and to lobby congress to increase government control over the food industry.

Voting with your wallet makes sense, but beyond that, what is really needed in my opinion is for the government to fulfill its duty to ensure free competitive markets which means free of monopolies.  Just as Standard Oil was busted up into 34 companies in the early 1900's the same needs to be done now for these monster food conglomerates.  Unfortunately from the view of the film producers who are quite obviously of a liberal persuasion, much more faith is put in government regulation than in the competition of free markets.  The film producers also clearly call for more monopolies in the form of labor unions and worker collective bargaining.  Again not trusting the free market to pay what they considered to be a reasonable wage.  They showed ads where an American meat packing company was attempting to recruit Mexican workers to come in to their USA plant (illegally crossing the border) where they were advertising $11 per hour.",1260230400,24,1976,4.9156626506024095
3867094,5,B0027BOL4G,"This documentary was fantastic. Are there better ones out there on this subject? Sure. ""The Future of Food"" was particularly good, but ""Food, Inc."" is a film a larger audience can relate to. That's my opinion anyway. I'm seriously thinking of sending copies of this film as a holiday gift to friends. I understand the blight of the chicken house industry that was once vibrant in parts of the South and have heard personal stories of people going in serious debt as a result. Up here living in the Midwest, corn and corn-fed beef (and ethanol) are all the rage. News of raids and deportation of immigrant workers in Postville, Iowa, doesn't arouse as much public concern as one might hope. Though people in this state do celebrate farmers' markets and have fabulous locally-grown produce. Interesting to behold the organic movement catching on right in America's Heartland where much of the corn is grown. I hope it catches on more in the future and we can break our dependence on the failing food system we have now.

I learned of Polyface Farm years back and wish we had access to their products out this way, but understand that violates their principle of keeping it local. The Polyface Inc. website lists restaurants where their products are used and ""metropolitan buying clubs"" for interested consumers in Virginia and Maryland. That's really nice how they have their sustainable farming business running, and I'd love for us to protect the few smaller family farms we have left out this way. Organic farming is such a good idea.

Monsanto is the closest thing to pure evil I've yet to confront. Wow. The more I learn about them, the more shocked I am that people haven't sounded alarms sooner. Aside from creating Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, they now provide a variant on RoundUp Ultra for our U.S. drug policy aerial fumigation campaign in Colombia, which is causing a humanitarian crisis in case anyone didn't know. Monsanto is also behind the global ""boom"" in golf courses, which rely on their lawncare products. Read up on biological patents and Monsanto and see how many patents they have accumulated. This is a company we seriously need to avoid from here on out, even if that means accepting a few weeds from time to time, mmmmk?  Scary bad, Monsanto is.

3867106,5,B0027BOL4G,"Absolutely, one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Watching and supporting this film is way more important than any charity you could ever think to help. However, it breaks my heart, that because the food industry is so heavily designed to prevent people from knowing the truth, most people will stay ignorant of these truths.

Corn, Beef, pork, chicken, fast food, lobbying, lawsuits, monopolies, over-weight, unhealthy chemicals and bacteria, diabetes, poor for the environment, bribed government officials and politicians, illegal immigrants, forcing your employees to remain silent about how they operate- It is all worse then you can possibly imagine, and it could be fixed if people started voting by how they spend their grocery money, and getting the government to stop protecting these insanely greedy and corrupt industries!

I am not getting all mushy and saying don't eat, or being kinder to the animals (though they show how that could be better here as well.) What I am talking about is how unhealthy mass-produced food is for you, America and the world. These large companies treat their employees, the animals, the competition and the environment like their worst enemies.

This program shouldn't keep you from eating what you want, but I sure do hope it will get people to support the companies that do things right, and that it will get the government to turn its eyes on the companies that don't and force them to have a conscious.

3867111,4,B0027BOL4G,"I completely enjoyed this film, even though yes - the information is found in many other sources, the assembling of the material was well done.

The only problem the film seems to neglect is the simple fact is there is too many people for the amount of food required globally.  If sustainability is the end intention of the film, which I believe is the true message, then all this does is draw a call to action to fix (end) the realities of America's manipulation of abundant cheap food which ultimately will result in the same outcome; world hunger due to too many mouths.

It is not politically correct to suggest we limit reproduction but essentially that is what is the only true solution to the issues on a global scale which the film dances around (however elegant it might suggest otherwise)  Let's be honest the population of the world looks like a hockey stick and the only result of such explosions upward are sharp corrections downward; which are witnessed in everything from collapsing ecosystems to stock market bubbles.  All are indicative of correction in some form or another and one thing humans have proven time and time again is our ability to ""not change"" until collapse/catastrophe but thankfully we adapt very well and change afterwards.

Some of you may feel change can occur to avoid such limitations, or argue redefining the system can meet all our needs but if viewed as a whole - across multiple issues outstanding and the realities of our continued multiplication that in the end it achieves the same result; we are simply a bad case of fleas until the earth decides to rid herself of us - she will.

Perhaps Earth Day should be renamed to People Day, since we are the ones at risk of exterminating ourselves... a simple asteroid can reset the whole process over again, and again, and again.. since we may have reached the limitation of this version.",1259366400,,1878,4.724770642201835

Theres too much food in there, u ask. That's just isn't right. We garner a lots of pomatos in the poultry isle, but are they tomats? No I tell, no! They are une nice idea of a tomatu, but they sure ain't a tomat! No seasons in grocery stores either, have you ever payed notice?

Is not that just a little unsettled? Theese chickens are starving w/ diseases and since they are so big they can not even hold there own wait to strole down to the pub for a bight. And then Kevin ate 3 ham bugars (intresting that it is called a HAM burgar, no?) that contained infected corn from infected cows and he was dead in 12 days! But that 12 days did not go without its unbenefits, he had a condition where he could only afford water from a small sponge for he begged for water and he ate upon that very sponge.

Our govt has been making handshakes with this corporations now. The USDNA & FDA turn one other blind eye to this scam of hurting us. We waste land for our greed. Corn. Animals = money = no humanity. Did you realize that workers were once african american, but are now undocumented workers? These crooked swines (swine flu?

3867116,3,B0027BOL4G,"The tenets of mass production have been praised and vilified for their effects on costs.  One camp lauds mass production for its ability to reduce costs and to place goods within the reach of the ordinary consumer.  Another camp criticizes mass production for its ability to hide costs rather than actually reduce them.  Of these two camps, Food, Inc. clearly falls in the latter one.  From a mutated chicken, to unsavory labor practices, to government policies run amok, Food, Inc. has one mission:  to lift the curtain on what is behind our hidden policy of cheap food.

At least for this reviewer, who read Pollan's book with gusto, there was nothing new here, and this was disappointing.  True, Food, Inc. challenges our labor and agricultural practices with sometimes brutal images, but all in all, it limits itself to retracing Pollan's steps.  In doing so, Food, Inc. merely provides a visual introduction to the characters and scenes Pollan already has described in vivid detail.

In some ways, this approach adds a visual layer of depth to Pollan's account of mass produced food in 21st Century America.  In the end, though, the message is still the same:  our policy of cheap food has consequences for society and the individual.  For those who are unaware of what these consequences are, Food, Inc. provides a thorough introduction and challenges you to do something about it.

3867117,4,B0027BOL4G,"""Food, Inc."" strives to be an expos of the American agricultural industry and a public service announcement that encourages the public to learn more about the food they eat and vote with their wallets at the grocery store. The film is narrated by Eric Schlosser, author of ""Fast Food Nation"", and Michael Pollan, author of ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" and ""The Botany of Desire"", all books that in some way discuss how food has been transformed by human design and its results. ""Food, Inc."" tries to cover a lot of territory, resulting in a film that is a bit fractured and uneven. We get a lot more information about some facets of modern American agriculture than others.

The impact of changes in how food is created in the past few decades, with increasing homogenization and the move from farms to a factory-created food supply, is a huge topic that could hardly be covered in a thousand pages, much less in an hour-and-a-half film. So ""Food, Inc."" concentrates on a few topics that director Robert Kenner must have thought dramatic enough to get the public's attention: the mistreatment of animals and farmers in the chicken industry, the rise in deadly e. coli 0157:H7 infections due to industrial beef production, and the obesity and diabetes that has resulted from cheap, abundant, federally subsidized corn.

There is a lack of cohesion that does not always serve the arguments well, but the topics are related. For example, the high populations of e. coli in cows is due to their being fed corn instead of grass, because federal subsidies of corn allow companies to buy it at less than the price of production. Corn products are in nearly all processed foods, putting Americans on a very unhealthful diet of cheap calories from high fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates. The segment on the beef industry focuses on the causes and consequences of uniformity. When the dominant buyer of a product (e.g. McDonald's is the largest purchaser of beef and potatoes in the US) demands a uniform product, the industry must transform itself  to meet that demand.

Some of the problems are unintended consequences of efforts to create an abundant and efficient food industry, while others are unethical or willfully ignorant behavior on the part of industry. The criticism of ""Food, Inc."" that I hear most frequently is that it doesn't present an alternative method of feeding the Earth's 6 billion inhabitants. But it doesn't need to. Sustainable agriculture works well on a large scale; monoculture is unsustainable by the agricultural industry's own admission; we are inundated with corn products not because we need them but because of subsidies; we produce too much food. Better, safer food is more expensive, but the prices of the junk are artificially depressed. And the federal government will be forced to reduce its agricultural subsidies in the coming decade anyway.

The DVD (Magnolia 2009): Bonus features are 8 deleted scenes, 7 celebrity public service announcements about nutrition and food safety, a list of web site ""Resources"", an ad (text) for ""Food, Inc: The Book"", a theatrical trailer (2 min) and 2 featurettes.

3867118,4,B0027BOL4G,"I'll start out with an anecdote.  A guy I know was starting out in the songwriting business.  He was hardly making any money at all.  To keep himself fed, he'd wait for the once a week 29 cent burger special at his local McDonalds.  Then he'd buy fifty of those things and put him in his freezer.  It was the cheapest way for him to get his ""fuel"" for the week.

That guy is now a very successful songwriter.  He also weighs about 280.  He's one of the oldest looking 40 year old men that I know.  I'm sure he's still eating a lot of awful food even though he's no longer eating the 29 cent specials and using the Dollar Menu.

This movie goes a long way in explaining just why we eat the junk that we do even though it's killing us.  The film shows that we do it partly because it's ridiculously cheap.  It's cheap because the government subsidizes growing the corn that provides us with our starch and sugar.  It's cheap because we treat our farm animals with incredible cruelty in the name of ""efficiency.""

The approach in this movie is a bit scattershot, but Food, Inc. does get its points across. I think it would have been far better if the film makers would have ignored the issue of genetically modified foods and patent law and kept focused on the issue of what we eat and why.  That said, overall the movie is well made, and clearly more money was put into this movie than most documentaries. It lifts the veil on the ugly world of agribusiness.  You can read about this issue in books, but seeing it with your own eyes is something else entirely.

3867120,5,B0027BOL4G,"Food, Inc. is valuable viewing for anyone who eats or feeds their family. The documentary is well made, and really serves as an introduction to the current food production practices that dictate the supply chain of the modern diet. In this video, you will learn:

1. That marketing of food products is very misleading. Most marketing attempts to present a wholesome and agrarian image leading consumers to believe that their foods come from natural and beautiful farms. Yet in reality most food comes from extremely unpleasant, and oftentimes barbaric, food factories.

2. Corporatization in a consumer society is destroying quality of life. When nothing matters but the bottom line and decisions are made in board rooms thousands of miles away from actual sites, where the primary concern is profit, quality goes out the window. Even worse, we begin to view living creatures as nothing but a collection of molecules that can and should be manipulated to maximize profit in the shortest amount of time, with total disregard to the pain and suffering caused to them. Consequently, it becomes accepted practice to subject them to a miserable and unnatural life, pump them with hormones and antibiotics, mutilate and hurt them callously, and so on. This in turn leads us to perceive fellow human beings in the same way, and the world in general as simply raw material that needs to be harvested for immediate gain by the most powerful. Classic corollary of merciless Darwinian thinking...

3. It's not all doom and gloom. YOU have the power to make choices that will force multi-national corporations to change their practices by necessity. Educating yourself and your family, with information such as in this documentary, is critical to not only saving yourself and your loved ones from misery and victimhood out of ignorance, but in also creating global change. A great case study is presented in Food, Inc. where the largest retailer in the world, Walmart, has now chosen to carry organic and hormone-free products because their consumers have chosen it.

4. Much more. There are lots of other topics and lessons one can gleam from this, and by making simple changes in the way we live and in the choices we make, we can begin returning to a more natural, fulfilling life. This is essential for future generations, for our children. Do we really want to pass onto them the world we inherited, where they are being exploited and manipulated out of ignorance? It's up to us to create change. Now is the time.

3867121,5,B0027BOL4G,"This movie starts with a simple question from Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council : ""In a way, we're not producing chickens, we're producing food.  What this accomplishes is to produce a lot of food in a small amount of space at a very affordable price.  Let somebody explain to me what's wrong with that.""  Well, this film does explain very well what's wrong with that.

The first point is that it is no good to treat animals as if they were mere *objects*.  You'll see chickens and beef up to their knees in their own droppings.  You'll also see chickens in their cages, not being able to carry even their own weight.  The animals are kept all the time in the dark, including for us.  It was very hard for the movie makers to obtain some footage from inside those chicken houses.

The second point, linked in a way to the preceding one, is that our food can easily become contaminated with E-coli, due to the droppings the animals carry on their skin.  That's how food poisoning can occur in the slaughterhouse.

Barbara Kowalcyk, mother of a 2.5 old year kid, lived through the most horrible experience anybody can suffer : the death of her child...  The reason : eating a ... hamburger...  ""We put faith in our government to be protected, but we're not being protected at the most basic level"", she says.  This is not an inconvenient truth - although this movie was produced by the same company that brought us the documentary with the same title.  This is an ugly truth.

Can we do something about it ?  Absolutely.  ""You can change the world, with every bite"".  Switch to organics.  Even better would be to connect yourself again with the source of your food, of what you are eating, of what you are putting in your mouth !  The best thing to do would be to get involved with a local farmer you know and can trust.",1258588800,3,1829,4.448795180722891

3867125,5,B0027BOL4G,"This is a documentary that everyone in America needs to see because food safety is an issue that directly affects us all, no matter who we are or where we live. The film begins with a flyover of the American heartland, zooming out through a painting of a farm house into a stroll down the supermarket aisle, with rows upon rows of products (47,000 in an average supermarket). All neatly packaged and arranged, they present an idyllic image of pastoral life that is completely incongruent with how food is produced today. Narrator, journalist, and UC Berkeley professor Michael Pollan begins, ""the way we eat has changed more in the last 50 years than in the previous 10,000"". Due to technological advances in mass production, mechanization, chemistry, and genetic engineering, the way food is produced now is vastly at odds with the fantasy of an agrarian America from the 30's to 50's that the food industry sells us on. A ""veil"" has been deliberately dropped between us and our food, because if we knew where our food came from, we wouldn't want to eat it anymore.

But ignorance is not bliss. It can literally make you sick to your stomach. If the BSE (mad cow's disease) scares and frequent reports of E. coli contamination in everything from hamburger patties to spinach to lettuce to tomatoes in the last several years haven't given you pause about the food you put on your family's dinner table and the trust you place in the companies that supply it, then you definitely need to watch this documentary. Just as recently as November 1 came reports of yet another E. coli breakout (this time from Fairbank Farms, spurring a 500,000+ pound recall, with 2 reported deaths and 11 sick). Anyone who is concerned with the health of his/her family needs to be made aware of the potential risks involved with eating the foods produced by this dangerous system.

Food today is less nourishing, less wholesome, and less safe than it was 50 or 60 years ago mainly as a result of large-scale mechanized production and factory-style agricultural practices that sacrifice quality for quantity and focus on making as much food as possible for the lowest cost (more fertilizers, more pesticides, high density feedlots, lower quality feed). We have cheaper, bigger, and faster foods and higher yields than ever before in human history, but such abundance comes at a cost to our health (increase rates of diabetes, obesity, and infection from food-borne pathogens), our land, and the dignity of private farmers and workers. Many of the foods we eat today are dangerously unsafe or unhealthy and this film explores the hidden human, health, and environmental costs of our modern industrial farming system. The topics covered include poultry, pig farming, cattle raising, corn, and being able to patent life (as Monsanto has done with seeds). Cattle, for example, are fed corn (because it is cheap and subsidized by the government), a food their bodies are not designed for, leading to dangerous build up of E. coli in their stomachs. In high density feed lots, they stand knee-deep in their own feces. Feces is everywhere and slaughtered at the rate of several thousands per hour in assembly-line slaughterhouses, it is very easy for the feces to enter the food chain. Ground beef is mixed with beef from thousands of other cows, exponentially increasing the chance of pathogen introduction. If you didn't know from recent news reports of cattle processors using ammonia to kill bacteria, now you do. Do you want to be eating ammonia in your hamburger patty?

If you are an educated food consumer, you will already know much of the information presented here from reading the numerous books on the food industry or watching such films as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fast-Food-Nation/dp/B000MEYKAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fast Food Nation</a>"" (which Eric Schlosser also produced), ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Size-Me/dp/B0002OXVBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Size Me</a>"", or PETA videos on animal abuse. This is an excellent and highly informative documentary that all consumers should watch. If there is one criticism, it's that the film tries to cover too many topics within its 90 minute runtime and sacrifices some depth for the sake of a more encompassing view of the entire food industry. It ends on a positive note, and even puts the oft-maligned Walmart in a good light, showing their buyers as being responsive to the demands of its consumers. The more we know about how our food is made, the more we can start demanding more wholesome, safer foods and changing the way these large multinational corporations operate. With the growth of organics and chains like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, the corporations are listening.",1258243200,2,4821,5.2020592020592025

3867128,5,B0027BOL4G,"This is one of the best social responsibility themed documentaries I have ever watched. I feel that this documentary covers all the bases on animal fair-treatment, the food safety impacts of industrial farming, and sustainable food production practices.

Food Inc goes in depth on the production operations of a sustainable Virginia chicken, beef, and pork farmer. This farmer is probably at least a little eccentric, but everything he says about pigs exercising their ""pigness"" and cows being cows makes total sense. He invited the cameras in to see how he raises, feeds, and even slaughters the animals. The film treats very fairly the contrast between this approach and the approach that industrial-scale meat packer Perdue requires its farmers to follow.

The film provides some focus to food safety, particularly as it relates to the role industrial processes play in promoting toxic e. coli proliferation. Alas, the film fails to make as clear a case for how e. coli has become such a problem as it has for the issues related to fair treatment of animals.

I appreciated the film's exploration of public food subsidies and how they impact food choices and public health. We follow a low-income Los Angeles-area family that is forced to buy cheap fast food instead of broccoli due to price and time. To summarize, a hamburger would be more expensive, but corn, soybean, and wheat overproduction paid for by the US farm-subsidy bills feeds cows and keeps beef cheaper than it should be.

There were pretty naive complaints of Monsanto's practice of prohibiting farmers from using the seeds that are naturally produced season after season on-farm by the plants it has engineered and patented. Monsanto prosecutes farmers doing this because this cuts into Monsanto's sales -- there's no reason to buy Monsanto's product if you can, in essence, re-use their product season after season. Unfortunately, the arguments were only skin deep and were akin to those that throw up their hands at the fact that pharmaceuticals cost so damn much money. Yeah, the seeds only cost a a tenth of a cent to produce, but the first seed cost $100 million, so what is Monsanto to do? Food Inc should have probed this issue deeper.

It is a great review of what has happened to our food supply and our treatment of the animals and farmers who used to be the backbone of the country. This dvd is an education we all need to have.
Thank goodness I grew up on a farm/ranch where the animals were all treated humanly, fed what they were meant to eat and prepared for food with care and cleanness and no one ever got ecoli. Our animals were all well fed with the things God intended them to eat and kept in clean open spaces. Our hens sang as they laid their eggs and as they went about their day.
I was sick as I saw what people who only care about money have done to us. They make me want to be a vegetarian or at least go totally organic or buy from a local farmer where I can see the conditions they are kept under.
My husband worked for a rancher who kept a pig confinement.
After he would go in and tend the pigs there was no way you could be around him because of the stink even after a shower and change of clothes. We got a different job as soon as we could find one. The pigs however spent their whole lives in that stink.
My nephew worked at a feedlot for cattle in Nebraska. When he would come in the house for supper even after a change of clothes and a shower you could not sit by him and eat supper because of the stink. The cows however were in that until the day they went to slaughter, up to their knees.
In this dvd I saw how the chicken confinement sheds are too. What a disgrace and a crime against God's creatures.
THen at the last to show how Monsanto has sued and broken the farmers who tried to keep our food supply clean and our corn and soybeans safe to eat.
In what we think is the greatest country in the world the corruption and graft is inexcusable. We have allowed the big companies to poison us and our children and put God's creatures though untold suffering.
You must see this dvd if you care about your self, your family and the helpless creatures they torture to death.

3867133,4,B0027BOL4G,"The documentary ""Food Inc."" treads familiar ground but in a visually compelling way that gives viewers glimpses, snapshots, and an overall picture of the problems of our food economy today.

The food economy is an impersonal monolithic system, and everything is interconnected -- the corporations seeking efficiency and profit, the consumers seeking the most calories at the cheapest price, the federal government that subsidizes this economy and winks at its misdeeds -- to create overabundance, wealth, and diversity of food that is not sustainable in the long-term, and which is already pernicious and destructive in its present form. It is what it is, as the popular phrase goes.

But ""Food Inc."" re-casts the food economy as an epic struggle between evil and good. The bad guys are the few corporations that control all the food in the United States. They mistreat animals, caging them in crowded pens where pigs and cows stand and sleep on their own manure. They hire illegal migrants who cannot unionize to work in their processing plants (and when a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment hits the United States the plant managers turn in a dozen immigrants a day to federal authorities, which in turn must maintain fear and discipline on the assembly line). Their heavy use of chemicals, fertilizers, and pesticides are destroying the environment, and their industrial large-scale food production leads often enough to virus outbreaks, such as e.coli. Because they control the supply chain these companies also prey on farmers, endlessly thinking of ways of control them. The heavy investment in buying barns to raise chicken is one such way, but a much more controversial way is how companies such as Monsanto have patented seeds and used the legal system to blackmail and extort farmers into using their patented products. They have won heavy government subsidies for crops that are fundamental to their bottom line (mainly corn, which is used to manufacture high-fructose corn syrup, a sweetener in many processed foods), and with these subsidized crops are able to make processed foods so cheaply that consumers find it cheaper to buy bad food than it is to eat healthy food (in a very good scene in the documentary a poor family goes to Burger King to order from their one-dollar take-out menu, and then goes to a supermarket where they discover they can't afford to buy fresh vegetables). And to ensure their monopoly on food production and prices food industry executives have implanted themselves into America's federal agencies charged with protecting consumer safety (Clarence Thomas was a Monsanto lawyer, and as a Supreme Court Justice he wrote the majority decision which permitted Monsanto to patent seeds).

It's hard to imagine how such a powerful monolithic system can be defeated, but as ""Fast Food Nation"" author Eric Schlosser reminds us the tobacco industry fifty years ago also seemed invincible. But consumers, voting with their pocketbook and at the polls, broke their shield of invincibility.

The tobacco industry and the food economy are not accurate comparisons. Tobacco can kill anyone, but it's mainly the poor who are obese and unhealthy (income is the best predictor of obesity). Second-hand smoke is dangerous, but as long as the poor stay bloated and overweight in their poor neighborhoods the rich won't mind. The unfortunate fact of life is that the price differential between eating healthy and eating junk food is tremendous -- a differential that's too much for poor people already burdened by their mortgage and their health bills. It will take tremendous will, discipline, and sacrifice for middle-class voters to force government to begin subsidizing healthy food that benefits everyone. Or these same middle-class voters can just shop at Whole Foods.

Something tells me the fresh air of a farmers' market is far more appealing to white middle-class voters than the dark manure of Washington.",1257724800,8,3938,5.175824175824176

3867135,4,B0027BOL4G,"Food, Inc is an activist documentary, which aims to educate consumers about the food system. This is much of the same information found in the author's books: Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation) and Michael Pollan (Omnivore's Dilemma). But it puts together many interesting points, especially from economist's point of view.

For one, most people don't think about how food is produced. We clearly see the benefits of mass production, such as lower prices and standardization, but not so much the downsides, such as poor conditions (for animals and workers), low diversity (system lacks resilience to external events, food is nutritionally limited) and health impact (unhealthy foods, obesity/diabetes, drug resistance, bacterial outbreaks).

The second angle is the role of government. The documentary provides key insights, but doesn't seem to follow them through. On one hand, it states that ""we put faith in our government to protect us"", but on the other it admits that it failed us in many ways (regulatory agencies are controlled/lobbied by the industries it means to regulate, revolving door between industry and agencies, the FDA often cannot close unsanitary factories, FDA hampers small local growers).
There are three government interventions which caught my attention. They are clearly called out, but somehow are not discussed in the context of reforms.

  1. subsidies to corn industry (pays to overproduce, distorts prices of meat, skews towards unhealthy food, makes it hard to compete locally and internationally)
  2. patent laws (give Monsanto leverage against farmers saving seeds)
  3. libel laws for food industry (mutes much of the criticism against them)

Finally, the documentary emphasizes consumer sovereignty. Aside from the artifacts of government intervention, the system is very sensitive to consumer demand. It shows the example of Wal-Mart which is shifting to some organic produces to satisfy customers, and marketing products without growth hormones.
The conclusion highlights consumer choice as a driver for the system, which I think makes sense. It also recommends asking Congress for additional regulation, which I think is a mistake (giving Congress more reach will give the industries more incentives to control the political process, leading to more negative effects as seen above).
But overall, this is a worthwhile documentary, especially if you have not read the recent popular books on the topic.

Despite the heartbreaking stories about how farmers are being bullied and put out of business, there are many positive messages shared like how changes in attitude toward organic and 'natural' food has become mainstream and an extremely profitable industry.",1257638400,3,433,5.417910447761194

3867139,5,B0027BOL4G,"Simply put, this is an outstanding documentary.  Not only does it give the viewer an inside peek into a very unhealthy, and frightening industry, it offers consumers some steps to take toward promoting change.  The bottom line is, if we do not buy inferior products, we will send a message to the food industry that we demand change. Our purchase power is our only leverage, since it is clear the government agencies are NOT on our side, and they don't have much regulatory authority, even if they were. When even Wal-Mart is now stocking some 'organic' products due to customer demand, we know we CAN be heard.  In fact, we need to be even louder, as we just say, 'NO!'

This movie will leave you sickened by the amount of toxins we are ingesting, and the foods that are barren of nutritional content.  The statistics regarding insulin resistance and the number of diabetics expected, in this, and the next generations, are staggering.  If we look further down the road, at our already fragile health-care system,  we can readily see that with these dire health predictions, due to poor nutrition, that any system, new, or old, will not be sustainable.

As the old saying goes, 'you can tell how civilized a population is by the way it treats its animals.' Well, it goes without saying, that we are failing miserably in this area.  However, watching the poor, enslaved workers in these processing plants, is just as uncivilized, and, a blight against humanity.

When you finish this film, you will never put another morsel in your mouth, without thinking of the poor animals so cruelly sacrificed, the subservient farmer, those in the processing plants, the toxins ingested, or the big fat cats, who are only out to make a buck. And, don't even get me started on the soybean monopoly. This part of the story will break your heart and make you wish you could never touch soy again, in protest; but we can't avoid it---and the industry knows it. Just like we can't possibly avoid CORN, or its byproducts.

I hope this movie will make more people think about how citizens are being manipulated for the wealth of a few.  It makes it clear we can make a difference, with a little work, and shedding the denial that has become our comfort zone.

We must remember, when we sit down to eat that juicy steak, that the cow didn't commit suicide for us.  And, the undocumented worker, that handled the meat? He may now be in a police car, after a decade, or more, of doing a horrendous job, 'one of the most dangerous in America,' just to survive. I wouldn't doubt that they are suddenly turned in when they become burned-out and less productive, or have sustained injury.  They are considered disposable. There is a dirty story behind every morsel, before it goes through our lips, for which, we must not remain ignorant.

3867144,4,B0027BOL4G,"Among the maxims carved on the entrances to the Greek temple of Apollo at Delphi, perhaps the most familiar and important were ""know thyself"" and ""nothing in excess.""  We have reached a point, two and a half millenia later, where we could really use both pieces of advice.  This film offers valuable wisdom to a culture in which the self is defined by the products we buy in far too much excess.

If we are what we eat, then most of us (this author included) have hardly any idea who or what we are.  We live in a culture of abstraction: we don't see what goes into the products we buy, and are unaware of the true costs of the food that sustains our lives.  Director Robert Kenner has created a film that puts various pieces of the puzzle together, and helps make clear what it is we're buying, and what it is we're buying into, when we demand cheap eats, and reveals the truth behind the illusion that most of our food comes from quaint farms.

As the film shows, by means of interviews, animations, effective video and surveillance tapes, there are hardly any family farms anymore, and most of our meat comes from massive factory farms in which animals are packed in tightly, wading through their own manure, rife with disease that is only partly kept in check by pumping chickens or pigs or cattle full of antibiotics.  That meat, of course, ends up in our food supply and in the fast food hamburgers, and there's hardly any effective oversight for consumer safety because, as it turns out, most of the regulators for the past couple of decades have been drawn directly from prominent positions in the industries they are supposed to regulate.  Then, there's the matter that all of these animals are mostly fed on corn, and most everything else we eat is made from corn or soy or corn and soy byproducts (such as high fructose corn syrup), primarily because corn is heavily subsidized in the United States, so that it can be sold below the cost of production.  The majority of the soy, it turns out, is bioengineered and patented by the same chemical company that produced those innovations we know as DDT and Agent Orange - and that same company (Monsanto) has made it virtually impossible for farmers to grow anything else but the seed that they must buy from Monsanto.  Not only that, but Monsanto's patents have made it illegal even for farmers to save their own seed from season to season, and Monsanto enforces its hegemony by means of intimidating lawsuits that most farmers just can't afford to fight.  It's a depressing story, made somewhat lighter by the inclusion in the film of a few somewhat successful crusaders fighting to bring healthy and sustainable farming and growing practices to the mainstream and to fight against the powers that profit a great deal from cheap and unhealthy foods.

The film offers only a bit in the way of positive suggestions for real change, and that may be its main weakness.  Of course, the advice it does offer is probably the only advice you can offer: first, vote for good foods with your wallet by buying organic and local, and by encouraging distributors like Walmart to expand their healthy offerings; and secondly, organize and wield political power to support candidates who encourage green practices and to encourage elected officials to favor better regulation.  I think it would have been more effective to highlight these messages clearly one at a time throughout the film, at strategic points, rather than mostly in a few written suggestions at the very end of the film and just before the credits.

Still, this is an important film that conveys a number of important and harrowing truths about the food industry more clearly and effectively than I've seen it elsewhere.  Of course there is Eric Schosser's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fast-Food-Nation/dp/0060838582/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fast Food Nation</a>, and Michael Pollan's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omnivore-s-Dilemma-A-Natural-History-of-Four-Meals/dp/0143038583/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals</a>, but both of them are featured here and this is a quick and effective way to convey the most important messages, that could be explored further.

Most of the content in the movie has already been reported by Schlosser. If you have read Fast Food Nation, there is not much need to watch this movie. Talk on fast food restaurants? Check. The link between obesity and unhealthy food? Check. Slaughterhouses and migrant workers? Check.

A lot of the movie topics have been covered by other documentaries, such as King Corn and Super Size Me. The parts that haven't appeared in other documentaries, such as the death of a young child who ate at Jack in the Box, make up a small minority of the film. There are countless scenes of farmers complaining about the meat packaging and farming system on their farms, which, while interesting, are drawn out to the point that they turn repetitive.

Overall, if you have read Fast Food Nation and loosely keep up with current events, there is not much need for you to watch this film that tells you so much of what you already know.

There is a microscope that magnifies the blood 16,000x its size.  Of course the general health industry doesn't use it nor will the government allow them to have it because of what you may find in your blood stream caused by eating GMF.

There's been a couple of test done using McDonald's meat & french fries.  You know that food when left out will usually mold and rot.  Apparently somebody kept a McDonald's quarter pounder and french fries for over 3 years in a metal lunch box.  The results... the fries look the same as it did when it left the fryer and the hamburger didn't change at all.  The meat may have shrunk just a little and the bread became slightly brittle and crumbled when handled.  ""What is McDonald feeding our children?"" asked the producer of that film.  I can't prove if what she says is true or not, however I left some fries in my car for several months and the fries never molded.  It was still greasy and salty but not a speck of mold on it.  You can view this by going to [...] and search under McDonald.

I personally will not eat meat anymore after watching Food Inc.  I was slowly moving in this direction anyway, however after viewing Food Inc. it made the process much easier.  Should I ever fall off the wagon, I will only eat cattle fed on grains or classified as organic. I will only buy locally grown foods or grow my own and buy organic if at all possible.  I will pay extra to ensure I know what is going into my body.

If you believe our government has our best interest, think again.  They've poisoned our water, shove chemicals into our bodies by promoting drugs (treat the symptoms, not find the cure), force vaccines onto our children which I truly believe is the route to all our major illnesses today, allow chemicals into our food, knowing it's harmful effects, and made sure they will not be held responsible by passing laws in their favor.

3867149,5,B0027BOL4G,"I saw Food, Inc. several days ago and many of the images still haunt me.  The essence of this movie is how food production in America has gone from being locally produced to being controlled by multi-national corporations.  The upside of this is that food is cheaper and more plentiful.  This movie examines the downside, which is horrifying.

All livestock (including fish) are now fed some sort of corn meal, regardless of whether this is what the would eat under ordinary circumstances.  For example, cows eat grass.  If they eat something else, it causes extra bacteria, including e-coli to grow in its stomach.  To treat this they are given antibiotics.  Milking cows are fed hormones to speed up milk production.  Chickens are fed so much corn to fat them up many cannot walk and they break their legs trying.  Or the legs get infected and they are given antibiotics.  One chicken farmer showed a ""typical"" day in the coop where she would go in and scoop up a dozen dead birds and through them on a gargabe heap. Lest it sound one sided, the large corporations were invited to participate in the movie and declined.

While parts of this movie are difficult to watch, ultimately it ends on a high note that we, as the consumer, have the power to change food production processes.  As one farmer pointed out, you wouldn't buy the cheapest car or the cheapest clothes, so why apply the same philosophy to the purchase and consumption of food.

It was OK for a documentary. It featured Michael Pollan, one of my favorite modern investigative writers in the general health field. You might have heard of some of his books... The Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food. He seems pretty objective and level-headed.

Food, Inc. wasn't really a vegetarian or vegan windfall, because it didn't come down especially hard on the eating of meat. It was hard on GMO products / labeling / patenting / subsidizing and the problems associated with large-scale meat production with the attendant medications and the revolting living conditions.

Many points were made, such as that cows aren't supposed to eat corn, and studies show a massive increase of E.Coli in their systems when they are fed it. Corn is the basic feed of cattle. When returned to a natural grass diet, the E. Coli levels dropped back to normal low levels.

3867153,5,B0027BOL4G,"Food Inc. is the new brilliant documentary which should shock all Americans about what has become of our food supply. It begins with the camera slowly panning through a supermarket, focusing on row after row of sanitized food products. The point is made that there are only a few multi-national corporations who actually produce the vast majority of food products seen on our supermarket shelves today. They seek to lull a complacent public into believing that the food we eat is wholesome and is produced in the simple spirit of our agrarian forefathers. Of course, we soon see that their marketing seeks to cover up a much more sinister reality.

Food Inc. first focuses on chicken production. The filmmakers got a hold of one chicken producer who raises chickens for Tyson Foods, perhaps the largest poultry provider in the country. The chicken producer was more than willing to show his behind-the scenes-operation until he was told by Tyson to shut up. It's obvious they didn't want him to show how the chickens were raised--thousands of them shut up in a building devoid of sunlight and being fed with cheap corn products to fatten them up. Today's chickens were contrasted with the chickens of yesteryear and today they are twice the size. They were able to interview a woman who raised chickens for Perdue. She apparently was fed up and refused to go along with Perdue's directives to raise her chickens using mass production techniques. But even with her more humane efforts, many of her chickens were dying due to antibiotic resistance. The woman herself indicated that she had developed health problems as a result of contact with these antibiotics. One of the film's revelations I wasn't aware of, was that these small businessmen are at the mercy of the conglomerates and if they don't do what they say, they'll be put out of business.

Another segment involves a food safety crusader who lost her three year old to E Coli contamination after eating a tainted hamburger. She sponsors ""Kevin's Law"", named after her fallen son but gets little support in Congress due to the lobbying efforts of the food industry who have prevented passage of the bill.

More shocking revelations abound including an extended segment on just how pervasive corn has not only been utilized as a cheap source of food for livestock (leading to the proliferation of manure that gets into our food supply) but also how it's used to create new processed food with little nutritional value. We also meet a lower middle-class Hispanic family who can't avoid eating fast food even though they're aware how unhealthy it is for them. The father is suffering from early onset Diabetes which is becoming one of the fastest growing health problems linked to eating unhealthy meals of processed food. The family not only doesn't have the time to shop for better foods but they don't have the money--so they end up going to McDonald's instead.

Immigrant workers are also exploited by the multinationals who used to recruit farmers in Mexico who could no longer compete against the big food producers in the U.S. They shipped the workers here in droves where they're now economically dependent on these corporations despite working in horribly unsanitary conditions. Now with anti-immigrant sentiment running wild, a few token workers are rounded up everyday to appease the public and the corporations are never charged with hiring illegal help.

The most shocking information we learn is the role of Monsanto Corporation monopolizing the soybean market. As a result of a Supreme Court decision, Monsanto now holds a 'patent' on their genetically modified soybean. They've ended up destroying the careers of small farmers by suing them for violation of their patents (Monsanto's soybean ends up as part of the farmers' crop so they're accused of infringement). What's worse is the long line of government officials, former Monstanto employees, who are now (and have been) in the highest positions in the Food and Drug Administration responsible for food safety oversight. Ten years ago, there were 50,000 food safety inspections a year--last year the FDA only authorized 9,000. And these officials weren't only appointed during the Bush administration. President Clinton also had a healthy share of these former Monsantoites working at the FDA.

While Monsanto is clearly the biggest villain among many, Food Inc. attempts to highlight more productive people in the 'system'. One interview focuses on an organic livestock producer who feeds his cattle grass and not corn. While it's clear he treats his livestock better than the conglomerates, I'm not a believer in the idea of 'compassionate slaughter'. Why eat meat at all? There's also an interview with the president of Stonyfield Farms, famous for organic yogurt. He ended up selling out to Walmart but he feels it was a good thing since 'better' products were made available to the public on a mass scale. Again, the sale of any kind of dairy products (organic or not) is not a good thing in the long run for one's health.

Food Inc. attempts to end on an optimistic note. It's up to the consumer to choose more healthy food. The example of successful consumer action is cited in the case of the tobacco industry which was brought down after the public woke up to the deleterious effects of its products. Until the public is willing to look behind the veil of unhealthy food production in this country, they will continue to enjoy bad meals at McDonald's and other nefarious 'restaurants'. Food Inc. is one of those rare documentaries which can open peoples' eyes--and that's not easy to do!",1247961600,15,5624,4.982960596379127

Our  government/business leaders are leading us down the incorrect path. It is hard to be hopeful.
I am a vegetarian ( nine years) and clearly remember the chicken looking through the cage. It was trying to comprehend what it was seeing. Will we comprehend what we are seeing?

3867155,5,B0027BOL4G,"I viewed this movie with the complimentary tickets granted by Chipotle at an independent movie theater here in the Portland area. This movie is a must see for every American.  The companies mentioned in the movie DO NOT want you to see this, as it would threaten their very evil existence. It was shocking to learn the companies can sue you for criticizing them in any shape or form.  The food chain is out of control here and something needs to be done to bring it down to earth again.  We cannot keep consuming the way we do. The problems of today, are a result of a system gone awfully wrong, and in the hands of a few, who want to personally gain from it.  They are not looking out for the interests of you and me, but merely their own pocket books.  This movie will educate the consumer that we DO HAVE the power to stop such practices. We do have the power to change something for the better.  It's not just another pep rally movie to promote some alternative lifestyle....These are facts and they affect EVERYONE of us....Definitely looking forward to the DVD and will purchase to share the knowledge with all I know.",1247702400,,1124,4.432038834951456

But, I didn't realize the influence that fast-food  and chemical companies had on U.S. agricultural practices. I am now buying more local and organic produce, due to this film. Robert Kenner's film is not anti-carnivore, but it does make a good case for seeking out the beef from grass-fed cattle, and eating wild salmon and free-range chicken.

The chicken coops in modern America are usually dark, crowded, and unhealthy places, with animals that can barely walk, since they have been bred to have breasts double the normal size. Seeds are genetically modified and patented, and then giant corporations prevent growers from using their own harvested seed. Corn is subsidized by the government and is then used to fatten cattle, but also fattens people--and also winds up in batteries and gasoline. E. coli is now a huge problem, due to current practices. There are fewer meat inspectors today than there were fifty years ago. Many appointees to the FDA are from the industries that should be regulated. Politicians of both political parties appoint them.

3867159,5,B0027BOL4G,"Robert Kenner's documentary food film demonstrates once again the public's hunger for a food ethic. As in previous films like Supersize Me and King Corn, the recipe for success is tried and, unfortunately, all too true. A few multi-national conglomerates, with the complicity of our federal regulatory agencies like the FDA and USDA, control a disproportionate amount of our food supply from farm to fork, to the detriment of public health, local farmers, international economies, exploited workers, the environment, and respect for animals. The sole corporate concern is a fat profit. If you are a farmer, you ought to think twice about challenging Monsanto. If you have children, consider that because of their ""normal"" diet, they have a 1 in 3 change of developing diabetes (1 in 2 if you are a minority). Much of this film is narrated by the understated Michael Pollan (The Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food) and Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation). Although the film includes some very brave and creative alternatives, it's been a long time since I left a movie theater feeling so angry and (the real tragedy) so helpless to do much about the problem. Manohla Dargis of the NYTs described Food, Inc. as ""one of the scariest films of the year.""",1246838400,28,1254,4.947867298578199
3867160,5,B0027BOL4G,"Fully agree with all the favorable reviews here.  A huge wake-up call for the American public to get more aware about the food industry.  This massive consolidation has been going on in most every major economic sector since 1980 ... finance, media, oil/energy, agriculture.

Consumers are not kings ... we are pawns.  We can still vote with our pocketbooks; but can we do enough quick enough to tame the Monsanto monsters of the world? Stay tuned.

See FOOD INC as often as you can...there's a lot there. Fields of vital information that have to be cultivated and disseminated.",1246492800,3,578,4.857142857142857

  I raised chickens 40 years ago and sold a dozen eggs for $1.00 to a high of $1.50. Now a dozen eggs is frequently $1.50 and for organic $3.00.  Something is wrong with the economics of 40 years and a tiny dollar change.
  I would like to know how law suits against ""free speech in criticizing large food companies""  has been allowed to happen in this country?
WHERE are the multi-famous lawyers that talk the 'big talk' against corporations hiding?  and, why are the lawyers not suing the massive food corporations?

3867162,5,B0027BOL4G,"I am a HUGE fan of Michael Pollan's ""The Omnivore's Dilemna"" and thus am delighted at this new documentary. Apart from pretty much bringing to life the first 2/3 of that book, the film also presents more information concerning the battle against industrial food companies. It pushed further into the symbiotic relationship between the government and these food companies, and the legal confrontation from the people.

Thankfully, this was NOT an anti-meat documentary, as it devoted a lot of time to critique the corn and soybean industries, especially the Monsanto monopoly. The film provided several tips on how to become more knowledgable about your food, how to buy and eat healthier, and what kind of laws are needed for the food industry to improve (research: Kevin's Law). It showed you the problems that you should know about (CAFOs and other industrial animal plants), the problems that you probably don't know about (veggie libel laws, the Monsanto soybean monopoly), and the present alternatives (Polyface Farms). It covers an amazing range of issues, and would only be better if filmmakers were able to get the corporations on camera. Unexpectedly, companies like Purdue, Tyson, Smithfield, and Monsanto were not compliant.

The most important message is know where your food comes from. Only by being informative can you decide for yourself what you want to eat.",1245715200,13,1375,5.1891891891891895
3867163,4,B0027BOL4G,"How many times do we have to see horror stories about how our food, the food we eat, the food that goes into our bodies is handled, before we stand up and do something about it? Apparently, many because we still haven't done anything.

""Food, Inc."", directed by Robert Kenner, and co-produced by Eric Schlosser (writer of ""Fast Food Nation"") and Michael Pollan (writer of ""The Omnivore's Dilemma), takes an in depth view at a handful of various problems with the food industry in our country. Presented in ""Chapters"", Schlosser or Pollan introduce the various segments leading into a series of graphics, interviews, archival and hidden camera footage and more all of which illustrates the problems we are facing.

Did you know that Chickens have been engineered to grow faster and larger, in order to produce more breast meat? The companies who provide us with chicken realized a while back that we prefer white meat. When a customer prefers something, it is more efficient to grow what the customer wants. White meat is also more expensive, so it is a win-win situation for these companies to fulfill our needs and wants. But what about the dark meat? The result? Engineered chickens ready for slaughter faster and yielding more white meat. But it also results in chickens with no flavor that are grown in very inhumane conditions. Most never see sunlight and can't walk for very long because their internal organs can't keep up with the growth of their bodies.

For many years, corn farmers have lobbied lawmakers for protection and subsidies, and this has created an overwhelming abundance of corn. Because there is so much of the grain, scientists have worked out many ways to use the abundant staple, to prevent wasting it, and to maximize profits. One of these, high fructose corn syrup, is now in a majority of the items we consume. But they also decided to start feeding the corn to cattle animals that are supposed to eat grass. There is a by-product of this new practice; e-coli bacteria. When the cattle eat this feed, they have a higher chance of creating the bacteria. And the fact they are contained in small lots, with barely enough room to move around, standing knee deep in their own feces for hours every day, doesn't help the situation.

Why do we raise the majority of the cattle in this country in such a fashion? Because the fast food industry (McDonalds purchases the most ground beef in the world) wants cheap beef. If they can feed the cattle more cheaply, those savings are passed on to the large chains and are then passed on to the consumer through ""Dollar"" and ""Value"" menus.

These are just two of the stories the film follows in detail. Providing a lot of information, the filmmakers connect the dots to illustrate why our food production system is in need of some drastic changes.

If we don't change it, we are going to continue to get sick, some of us will continue to die. And it is all preventable.

Why do we allow it to continue? A handful of very large companies control all of the production of our processed foods. They lobby Congress and the Senate, getting the lawmakers to protect them. They don't have to do anything about it. When there is an outbreak, they make some minor changes, but as we saw from the E-Coli outbreak in hamburger, it happened a few times and will no doubt happen again.

People are getting the message. Organic foods, farmer's markets and grocery chains like Whole Foods are becoming more and more prevalent popping up to meet the needs of a growing, more selective clientele.

Are you getting the message?

Or do you still want that hamburger that only costs $1?",1245196800,252,3631,4.712933753943218
