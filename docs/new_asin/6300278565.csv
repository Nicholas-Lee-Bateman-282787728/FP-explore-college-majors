8483734,1,6300278565,yet another ok volume of the best of set i think the dark match kamala vs santana is good good way to get the fans into actually buying the volumes and the other matches i kind of like orndorff vs george steele and brutus debuting his barber gimmicks against long time former manager i think i used the wrong context for that also the machines vs the heenan family is interesting i always like the concept of the masked men.,1058313600,,424,4.3125
