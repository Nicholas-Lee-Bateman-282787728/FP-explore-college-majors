8150010,5,B000JD6L3S,This is a very good film.  The story of this young lad really informs one of what our ancestor's lives might have been like.,1355097600,,124,4.166666666666667
8150011,2,B000JD6L3S,"What was the point of this film? In my opinion, it may get some play because of the nudity, but I'm sure that wasn't the point. The realities of class distinction, the flawed mixing of religion and politics, and grinding poverty are addressed, but weakly. I wasn't able to lose myself in this film. The acting seemed stilted and I was bludgeoned with characterization.

This is not the first European movie I've viewed, nor will it be the last. But I really expected more.",1196985600,18,472,4.619047619047619
