Horrible special effects, lame fights, stupid story, terrible acting, and bad music.... and not in a good way.  You know how movies are so stupid they're funny?  This is just stupid.

1940452,3,B0000SX9N2,"The movie is quite good until Jackie gets the medallion. From that point on, wirework reigns supreme. Very unprofessional wirework at that. There are very funny sequences and lines throughout and the action is great in early scenes. All the characters have chemistry but the film is brought down by the title object. The medallion itself has a convoluted back story and the medallion causes great absurdity that mars the film. If one could remove the medallion from the story and retain its good points within a more believable story, this film could be a winner but as it is it is just okay.",1469923200,,592,4.701923076923077

1940506,2,B0000SX9N2,"The Medallion(2003) is the kind of movie that could've worked, but didn't. It was a big budget Hong Kong movie with an international appeal. The finished film had plot holes, an overkill of CGI, deleted key scenes, and an anti-climax! The humor in the film is a hit or miss affair. This could be our only chance at seeing Jackie Chan and Lee Evans in the same movie. Claire Forlani is sexy and she is one of the better female leads in a Jackie Chan movie. Chan and Evans play secret agents who chase a crime boss. This crime boss is using a child with supernatural powers so he can control the world and gain immortality! The screenwriters borrow some pages from Raiders of the Lost Ark(1981) and The Golden Child(1986). The film has a dark scene where Jackie Chan's character dies and is resurrected by a...Medallion! Anthony Wong(Hard Boiled, Black Mask) isn't given a lot of lines and he looks silly as a bad guy in fancy clothes! What's with the corny Avril Lavigne song playing during the end credits? Christy Chung was probably cast due to the fact that she speaks fluent English. Columbia-Tristar cut many key scenes from the film that explained why the authorities were going after the villain. The film's working title was Highbinders. The Medallion was a critical and commercial flop, but we can see it for almost nothing.",1308182400,,1332,4.672340425531915

Plus she does a lot of her own stunts and is pretty good. Fun film for an evening in.",1298332800,,319,4.423728813559322
1940508,4,B0000SX9N2,"It has been a long time since I watched this movie. Tonight, I refreshed my memory and forgot how good it was. Jackie Chan stars as a Hong Kong police officer named Eddie Yang who is working with Interpol in order to bring down a man named Snakehead. Eddie teams up with his girlfriend, Nichole and a clumsy doofus named Arthur Watson. When Eddie dies during his investigation, he is brought back to life by a powerful medallion that gives him superhuman powers. Eddie uses this power to stop Snakehead from using the medallion in a bad way. If you love action and comedy, you'll love THE MEDALLION!!!",1277337600,,601,4.574074074074074
1940529,3,B0000SX9N2,"""Legend says every thousand years a child is chosen that can bind the two halves of the medallion together and restore life to the dead. Now you get that kid AND the medallion? You're a god."" In THE MEDALLION Hong Kong detective Eddie Yang teams up with two Interpol agents (Claire Forlani, Lee Evans) to take down the British criminal mastermind Snakehead. Snakehead (Julian Sands) nurses definite world-conquering ambitions and he sets his eyes on obtaining a mystical medallion which bestows its owner with super-strength, immortality, and other extraordinary abilitiies. But the key lies in the mystical little Chinese boy who controls the medallion, and you'll just have to overlook the fact that even though this sacred kid inhabits a Buddhist temple deep in the sewers of Hong Kong, he speaks with an English accent. The boy falls under Eddie Yang's protection. Eddie's protection kinda sucks.

I like this movie mostly because Jackie Chan is in it, and because I love Claire Forlani and her marvelous eyes, and occasionally Lee Evans's oddball, fumbly comedy stylings (""Interpol, freeze!""). Jackie's physicality is as amazing as ever, and the best sequence here may well be his pursuit of a lanky, particularly agile henchman thru the streets of Dublin. When Jackie effortlessly scales that tall gated wall, whew... But THE MEDALLION demonstrates again that a Jackie Chan picture doesn't fare too well with CGI, and this is because Jackie by himself is a walking, breathing special effects. Jackie has performed his own death-defying stunts for so long that any outside embellishments just seems superfluous; it really feels like cheating. As far as his role in the film, I thought Eddie Yang was handling his business pretty well before he gained all these super powers... although, okay, he did end up drowning to death. The first half of the film is fantastic, action wise. Afterwards, the CG stuff takes over and it's a bit much. Jackie Chan by his natural self is a hard chap to kill. His having super powers, it just doesn't seem fair.

Claire Forlani and Jackie Chan achieve this sort of sweet relationship, although their romance is more lukewarm than anything. Chan has better chemistry with Lee Evans, even though Evans stabs him, experimentally, like a billion times in one scene. Some things to look forward to: Forlani (or maybe her double) shows off some martial arts skills and the wife of Lee Evans' character ends up surprising you. And, as ever, stay tuned for the blooper reel during the closing credits.

I mentioned that I occasionally enjoyed Lee Evans's humor, but a bit of him does go a long way. Mostly, the comedy in THE MEDALLION is pretty painful. Julian Sands as the villain fails to invoke that same sinister presence he brought to WARLOCK. I'm also not feeling his showdowns with Jackie. THE MEDALLION is worth a look because of Jackie being Jackie in the first half. Ironically, when Jackie sinks and drowns halfway thru and is then resurrected, it's really from that point that the movie itself really begins to capsize.",1276300800,,3061,4.962962962962963
1940530,5,B0000SX9N2,"The Medalion is one of my favorite films and has been for many years. The mysticism is somewhat disturbing in my opinion, but overall a great flick.",1272844800,,148,4.518518518518518

1940532,5,B0000SX9N2,"Aside from other reviewers who apparently have it in for this movie, I actually rather enjoyed it. Granted, I agree that the dub was pretty so-so and a bit corny. But, well, it's a Jackie Chan movie! Were we really expecting Citizen Kane?

I thought the action was good, and generally enjoyed it. Sure, the villain was a bit over-the-top, and the plot premise was a bit hard to believe (not entirely unlike the premise of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Child/dp/6305310351/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Child</a>, with Eddie Murphy), but then again, when is that ever NOT the case in a Jackie Chan movie?

In all, I like the movie. Perhaps not as much as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Forbidden-Kingdom/dp/B0013FZUQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Forbidden Kingdom</a>.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Myth/dp/B000UNYK3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Myth</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rush-Hour/dp/B0010L073I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rush Hour</a>&nbsp;series.

1940534,2,B0000SX9N2,"I usually like Jackie Chan movies, clean, funny, action, good stuff.  And this one had Claire Forlani, awesome, and then Lee Evans.  I think the story line didn't fit the acts and was just too much for people to take in.  Acting was okay, but there was just too much far fetched and unanswered questions to make this believible or interesting.  Really, skip this movie, don't watch, don't buy!",1198627200,,393,4.6521739130434785
1940535,2,B0000SX9N2,"Before I began to bash this film, its not because it is just a gosh awful film, but in comparison to most Chan films this is possibly his weakest entry.  Sure, he is getting a little older these days, but he can still put out films like New Police Story, I just don't understand.  If he was aiming for a kids movie with Medallion, then he has succeeded.  And if there was anything I did enjoy most from this film, it didn't necassarily come from Chan himself.

Bascially, this really did seem like something made for kids.  The idea of The Medallion did not appeal to me at all, and seemed rather corny and cheesy.  It is about a young boy who holds the power of life and death in a medallion, which he is the chosen protector of.  There wasn't much exploration throughout the film about the medallion.  We get to see it used twice, bringing the Chan character back to life early on and again briefly for the villain.  Other than that, this is basically a back and forth chase movie, as bad guys and good guys try to claim the boy and medallion.

Most Chan movies have lots of chases - by foot, bicycle, car and who knows what.  In Medallion, the action sequences and chases are kind of boring for a Chan film.  Lots of wirework and digital graphics are used, which means hardly any real stunts from Jackie.  There is a foot chase early on that lasts for several minutes where Chan walks across a row of bicycles and does some other nice things, but thats about it.  As far as fights go, I was also dissapointed.  Chan fights the bad guy (Jullian Sands) twice, but both scenes are laughably bad.  There was no skill involved, as everyhting was digital and bad camera work.

In addition to a weak story, the characters were quite uninteresting and there was little development between them.  The humor you expect from Chan films is a different kind of humor, provided mostly by the Lee Evans character, who is Chan's partner.  For awhile I thought his humor was kind of stupid, but eventually it should give some laughs, and ends up being about the only enjoybale thing out of this film.

Don't expect anything serious, anything great, or any teriffic action.  This is a lousy film that is worth watching once and probably it.  I definetly see this designed more for kids.  It was just too cheesy and poor for my taste.  Jackie Chan fans will most likely be dissapointed.",1187568000,,2370,4.4581395348837205
1940536,1,B0000SX9N2,"I really like most Jackie Chan movies, but nothing could redeem this stinker.  The less said about the plot, the better.  The dialogue was awful.  And the action scenes aren't even very good.  The most enjoyment I got out of this movie was sitting around afterwards drinking to forget and hoping that in our drunken stupors, the movie would magically make sense and be entertaining.",1187049600,,382,4.8307692307692305
1940537,1,B0000SX9N2,"this movie was horrible I just watched it and it felt like forever. the comedy in the movie sucked there were ONLY 3 scenes that were actually funny and they were with Lee Evans, Jackie was just not his old self in this movie he is either getting old or not in shape, and Claire forlani's acting was horrible big time the movie could have been way better with out her.

I also did not like that most of jackie's stunts were done with wires. the story line was ok but it needed some real comedy, i was bored through most of the movie and I hope jackie's talent doesn't go to waste and he starts acting in better movies.",1174521600,,618,4.15
1940538,2,B0000SX9N2,"I love Jackie Chan and all of his movies, buy I will admit this is not one of his best. It's quite bad actually, I bought it cos it was cheap and I like to own all of Jackie's movies in my collection. Not even Claire Forlani could really save this one, she looks totally out of place in this movie. I only recommend it to serious Jackie fans, I couldn't imagine anyone else getting through the whole 85 minutes.",1166745600,2,411,4.15
1940549,3,B0000SX9N2,"If you saw the previews thinking that this would be Chan's first movie as a superpowered martial artist (a la ""The Matrix""), you will be disappointed. In fact, the best action sequences happen BEFORE Chan's character gains his superpowers. And this movie does have a few neat stunts, like the Dublin parkour chase scene. But after that, this movie has nothing much of significance.

This movie is not really an American film. It was made by Golden Port, an HK company, but Columbia Tristar bought the rights to this film in every country, and cut the original 108 minute movie down to 88 minutes (even though when you watch it, it'll seem like forever). The original plot was supposed to be about a man named Snakehead who smuggled Asian immigrants into other countries, leaving few survivors. The medallion he is after resurrects people and gives them supernatural powers, turning them into ""highbinders"" (""Highbinders"" was the original title of the movie). But, Columbia Tristar cut a lot of the plot out and just made the focus of the film on the medallion only. This resulted in the need for much post production dubbing by the actors! But you do get the deleted scenes on this DVD. Almost every line of Cantonese was dubbed as well.",1139961600,2,1237,4.780373831775701

1940551,5,B0000SX9N2,"'The Medallion' captures all of the qualities fans of Jakie Chan know and love, action, supspense, extreme humor, and a touch of mystisism, all the qualities I know and loved in the KID'S WB! 'Jakie Chan: Adventures' cartoon series. It has a great cast [Julian Sands as the dreaded Snakehead, Claire Forlani as the high kicking Interpol Agent Nicole, Lee Evens as the bumbling Agent Watson, and, of course, Jakie Chan as the Chinese Super-Man Eddie Yang] that help give the movie a great energy. The greatest thing about it was it wasn't afraid to make fun of itself! Great movie, I hope they make a sequel!",1133222400,3,607,4.682242990654205
1940552,3,B0000SX9N2,"While I've found myself enjoying the freespirited nature of most of Jackie Chan's films, THE MEDALLION isn't up to par.  In fact, it is Lee Evans as Chan's rather inept partner who steals the movie.  Reminiscent of Keystone Kops or Jerry Lewis, Evans (Mouse Hunt) is a neurotic and high pitched walking bundle of comic nerves.  He brings much needed life to the film; Chan seems a little disoriented and tired at times.  The movie's flimsy plot about the powers of an ancient medallion never reaches the frenzie level of some of Chan's earlier films, and Claire Forlani, though quite a lovely actress, doesn't have the fire and verve necessary to be a force to reckon with. But as long as Evans is on the screen, THE MEDALLION is fun.",1127260800,,734,4.623076923076923
1940553,4,B0000SX9N2,"Jackie again does all his own stunts in this action comedy also starring Claire Forlani and Lee Evans.

I quite like this movie. Note that despite seeming like a Hollywood film it is actually a Hong Kong film shot in Hong Kong, Thailand and Ireland. I've been debating as to whether or not to give it 3 or 4 stars but I've chosen to go with 4 stars. The film itself has pretty average action and comedy, but the idea that this movie is really aiming to be something great appeals to me. The outtakes at the end of the film are also very funny.

The DVD has a very straight laced audio commentary- not that much fun but nonetheless informative. It also features a wide array of deleted scenes. I'm kinda glad the deleted scenes didn't make it into the film. Only one is worthwhile, and that involves Jackie Chan revealing that he is alive to Claire Forlani. It explores the history of the characters very well and it's a shame it was cut from the film. It also has Claire Forlani at her dramatic best (quite reminiscent of her role in ""Meet Joe Black"").

In summary, The Medallion is short and sweet. Check it out. You might like it.",1124582400,2,1132,4.355450236966824
1940554,2,B0000SX9N2,"In this movie, Jackie Chan is a Hong Kong detective who investigates a smuggler after an artifact called ""The Medallion"" that can give eternal life to those who wears it. However, there is a child who bears its powers and he was kidnapped. So, of course, Jackie Chan must save the child and stop the bad guys from misusing the Medallion.

The problem with this Jackie Chan movie...is that it's not a Jackie Chan movie. I am a fan of many actors, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Varney, Chris Tucker, but there is no actor I hold as high as Jackie Chan. I have seen virtually every movie of his back from when he was a teenager and I'm still searching for all the well hidden films of his.  To make the point short, I am an enormous Jackie Chan fan.

What does that mean? Basically, it means I'll watch anything with Jackie Chan in it. Hell, I'll watch an martial arts porno if it has Jackie Chan in it. What THIS translate to is that I'm not difficult to please when it comes to Jackie Chan movies. All you have to do is star him and let him fight, preferably for at least 40% of the movie, and I'll love it. So how in the hell did this movie turn out like this?

Well, because they mess up the fighting scenes. I hate those magical-type martial arts movies and, in this one, Jackie is jumping all over the place. What a misuse of talent. I hated this movie because it didn't have any of the classic Jackie Chan attributes.

There was no jaw dropping fight scenes, there was virtually no Jackie-type comedy, there was no ANYTHING! You could replace Jackie Chan with Jet Li and I don't think people would notice the difference. This movie is an atrocity and, frankly, it should be torched. Jackie Chan movies from decades ago is better than this.",1107216000,3,1748,4.366153846153846
1940555,1,B0000SX9N2,"Now don't get me wrong, Jackie Chan is one of my favorite actors of all time and I've loved watching his movies ever since first seeing ""Rumble In The Bronx"" in the spring of 2001, albeit five years late, and I've come to enjoy many of his other movies but his 2003 outing called ""The Medallion"" is without a doubt the weakest moive that he's ever starred in and is a major disappointment considering how great many of his others, or even his other subpar films at least had some funny moments. On here however, even the funny momemts are hardly enough to muster up a laugh at all.

Jackie Chan stars as a Hong Kong detective who is investigating a notorious international smuggler who is after a mysterious ancient artifact called The Medallion that resurrects and gives eternal life to those who wear it but a kid who bears it's power is kidnapped by the smugglers and now the Hong Kong detective must rescue him from them and retrieve the artifact before it is used by the ringleaders.

 Sadly, being a huge Jackie Chan fan, ""The Medallion"" is by far the most uninspiring movie that he has ever starred in. Even all of the slapstick stunts are nowhere near as funny as like those in classics like ""Rush Hour"" or his cult hit ""Rumble In The Bronx"". There is virtually nothing that inspires laughs like the truck full of childrens play balls falling off the fourth level parking garage in ""Rumble In The Bronx"" or even those from ""The Tuxedo"", his weakest movie before this travesty came along.

 The acting is absolutely ridiculous and even Jackie's eccentricity that has made him so much fun to watch isn't enough to save this garbage. The acting by almost everyone else doesn't help either. Everything about this movie gives a sense of this having ground already been traveled on countless times without giving it a different light.

 I am a major Jackie Chan fan and have been for many years but this is the first time that I have felt really let down by a movie of his. If this is a sign of artistic decay then ""The Medallion"" is perhaps a crossroad of where Jackie must try to come up with new ideas to bring new magic into his career because this movie has none of that. An outright disappointment.",1100217600,4,2206,4.513784461152882
1940556,1,B0000SX9N2,"Boy is this thing one of the worst films I have ever seen. I know and accept that a Jackie Chan movie doesn't care much about its story or characters, and using only a thin plot as an excuse to showcase his near superhuman acrobatic and comedic combat skills. However, this film, especially in the early going, is so lifeless and unexciting that it nearly resembles a funeral procession. There is none of that patented Jackie Chan energy and joy anywhere to be found, and he seems to be just going through the motions of movie making. It can't even work as a background distraction and merely annoys with its complete blandness. Worst of all none of the stuntworks were choreographed or filmed with even an ounce of creativity, and simply relegates Jackie to scale tall objects of various types. This is where an infantile script and failed comedy bits come together to murder the film. It's so bad I actually developed chest pains watching it, and I can't say that about too many films. Frankly Jackie deserves better, but perhaps it's a sign for him to retire. The only saving grace is the delicious presence of female lead Claire Forlani, who is perfection personified. Though that illusion works better with the activation of the mute button. I will still take two of her please. Where was I?

1) Jackie's character must be named ""Jackie.""
2) Jackie's character (or ""Jackie"") must start the movie as a cab driver, or butler, or similarly innocuous occupation, and only get roped into crime-fighting ACCIDENTALLY. This way, he can go half the movie with a confused look on his face.
3) If there are artifacts or other elements of Eastern mythology, they are introduced by a sexy female archaeologist.
4) If there is a sidekick, he must actually be FUNNY (i.e. Owen Wilson).
5) Jackie must appear naked at some point in the movie (actually, they remembered this one).
6) The outtakes ought to show Jackie doing things that would get a regular, non-Jackie-Chan person killed.

The medallion gives people special powers.  Snakehead kidnaps the kid and Chan is in the hunt to save the kid and keep the medallion out of Snakehead's hands.
Unfortunately, the plot is awful and makes little sense.  The fight scenes are not very good.  The movie essentially breaks down into a not very interesting series of vignettes that I could never decide whether they were supposed to be funny, scary, thrilling - they were just plan dumb.

1940565,3,B0000SX9N2,"OK, let's face it.  ""The Medallion"" which is basically a Hong Kong film (directed by Gordon Chan), is a disappointment to many fans in English-speaking countries.  Yes, the plot about the big medal is silly at best.  The jokes are corny (sure), and the CGI-enhanced actions are not clearly the best of Jackie Chan (who is 50 years old, but doesn't look like that).  And as to his Hong Kong roots, Jackie made better films like ""Who Am I?"" ""Project A"" and several ""Police Story""s.
But ""The Medallion"" is not as bad as other reviews suggest, as long as you are a die-hard Jackie Chan fan.  You can sidestep the story (for which five names credited!) about the magical golden medallion, and the thug who wants it (Julian Sands), and the buddies who chase him (Chan and delightful Lee Evans).  After a botched police raid in Hong Kong, we see Chan's character Eddie landed in Dublin (but why Dublin?  DON'T THINK!).  Eddie meets Nicole (Claire Forlani, so beautiful) in the office, and the latter slaps him in the face for no other reason than to show her 'I love you but you treat me bad' attitude.  Don't say it's corny, just have fun (or pretend that you didn't see).
And the actions start.  They are choreographed by legendary figure Sammo Hung Kam-Bo, who worked with Jackie many times before.  The stunts are adequate, just good, but the use of wire is sometimes glaringly obvious while Jackie's movement itself is still agile.  Still while watching it, I remembered his death-defying stunt in ""Rumbles in Bronx"" in which Jackie literally jumped from the top of the building to the terrace of the next one.  It was a superhuman feat, and he said that he didn't use wire because it made the movements unnnatural.  Sorry, but Jackie, the same thing is happening here now.
The supports are surprisingly good (I mean, compared with noisy Chris Tucker in the two ""Rush Hour""s), and surely high-kicking Clair Forlani looks great.  I don't say she is as great as  Jennifer in the TV series ""Alias,"" but still far better than another Jennifer in ""The Tuxedo.""  And she is incredibly amiable and charming in the end credit outtakes.
Far from his best, and still not his worst, ""The Medallion"" is strictly for Jackie Chan's avid fans.  Do not make this your starting point for watching the Jackie films, though.",1087776000,,2303,4.686567164179104

In this movie he plays as a cop who dies and comes back to life because of the Medallions powers. He get lots of strength and can take bullets without being killed. This is one of his movies where he doesn't have lots of cool stunts and all the action. I like when he uses more of the items around him to defeat his enemies but he doesnt use any in this movie. I have only seen one movie where Jackie is killed and that is The Prisoner.

What you expect, Jackie is 50 years old this year but I think he could still do what he did in his older movies. All of his current time movies have something in them that gives him power and strength that a normal person wouldn't have. What happens in his older movies such as Rumble in the Bronx, and First Strike could happen at any time in real life which made them better.

The dialogue is bad and it's made SO much worse by all the crappy dubbing!  There is very little Cantonese so it would have been fine to give us subtitles.  Most of the film is in English.  The incredibly annoying problem is Anthony Wong's voice actually changes in the film!  It's him when he speaks to the English speakers (he can speak English fine) but they dubbed him when he's speaking to the Cantonese actors.  Great...two voices?!?!  It's so obvious in some scenes as he goes from English to Cantonese and back again that it's annoying.

Don't spend too much money on this flop, but if you're a JC fan it's hard not to see all his films.  Skip Medallion until you've seen the rest.  Surprisingly there are some good co-stars here, which is why I give this two stars instead of one.  Medallion might be be tied with Tuxedo as the worst JC film, just because of all the guest stars.

1940591,3,B0000SX9N2,"The Medallion marks the return of Jackie Chan to his Hong Kong cinema roots and style..sort of..Veteran martial arts HK director Gordon Chan in his first international/English language film manages to add a lot of the action sequences that gave Hong Kong films the cult status enjoyed the world over: the brilliantly executed fights and stunts, with so much jumping and flying off walls (literarly) that will make Spiderman watch in envy.
And of course, Jackie Chan being Jackie Chan, he manages to add his unique comic style to almost every scene he is in. The universal appeal of Chan and his extraordinary abilities both as an actor and as a martial arts master, endears him to the viewers and makes his films highly enjoyable even if the script and direction are not great,(and indeed the script of Medallion is pretty lame, the usual good vs a psycho evil who wants to destroy/control the world, with  added Chinese myths to the mould)
Helping Chan fight evil is the highly talented Brit stand up comedian Lee Evans, who is slowly making a name for himself in Hollywood after the success of There is Something About Mary, and Claire Forlani, who not only is one of the most beautiful women in the world, but she does a competent job as Chan's love interest and side kick.
Evil is portrayed by Julian Sands,who does an ok job. Although he is an excellent actor, his choice of some roles dod not help his career.(Remember he has Mercy and Boxing Helena to his name!!)
One refreshing aspect of the film was the choice of Dublin as the setting for the action,instead of London, Paris or Prague that international/American directors mainly choose for any European based plots.
So Medallion is not a film that will blow you away,but it has Jackie Chan doing very well what he does and knows best,it has the angelic Forlani, and action that will keep you entertained throughout its 84 minutes. Not Bad.",1074988800,,1900,4.72289156626506

It was just so bad, watching him play the romantic, and the girl was such a bad actress, it was painful to watch.
Don't get me started on the side-kick, he and Jackie just didn't have the chemistry that the other guy and Jackie had in 'Shanghi Noon' and 'Shanghi Knights'.  The plot line was weird, it's as if the directors are running out of reasons why Jackie continues to kick... in movies.

1940606,4,B0000SX9N2,"First off i would have given it a 3.5
Jackie Chan is almost 50, and still lithe as a cat scaling a wall. Nevertheless, it is clear in The Medallion that he is not the miraculous whirlwind he once was.
His fight scenes and chases, while still choreographed with balletic ingenuity, tend to highlight earth-bound skills - like that wall-climbing trick he still executes so effortlessly.
More tellingly, he submits at long last to the dominion of special effects.
Particularly in the second half of the movie, he sails through the air in fanciful style, propelled by wires and computer-generated illusions.
There is nothing inherently wrong with that, and heaven knows no other action star at work today has shown Chan's uncanny stamina. The guy deserves a break.
Still, the high-flying digital tricks signal the end of the pure-Jackie era of no stunt doubles, no wires and no computer effects.
Old-schoolers may mourn, but action stars like to show they are more than fists and feet, so why not the Chan Man himself?
As if to underscore the transition to a new style, The Medallion also gives Chan a reasonable facsimile of a romance, not to mention his first serious on-screen kiss.
Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black) does an able job as Nicole James, an Interpol officer who reconnects with Hong Kong inspector Eddie Yang (Chan) when he goes to Ireland looking for a kidnapped child.
It seems the little boy was born to fulfill an ancient Buddhist prophecy about supernatural powers - including life and death - to be had with a certain magical medallion.
Naturally, a megalomaniacal bad guy - with the wickedly lurid name of Snakehead (Julian Sands) - has gotten wind of the prophecy and means to have the medallion for himself.
In the opening scenes, Eddie rescues the boy from a burning room shortly after sharing his octopus dinner with a street-side dog. (Nobody ever accused the Hong Kong action-movie community of excessive subtlety.) For the rest of the movie, he performs variations of the same feat, as the kid changes hands several times.
At one point, Eddie even appears to be stone-cold dead, but having bonded with the life-and-death kid, he gets to come back. His rebirth bonus is virtual immortality. He can feel pain but doesn't bleed when injured - as demonstrated in a funny scene when he is stabbed repeatedly by an incredulous crony.
That crony is another Interpol agent called Watson, played by the British slapstick comic Lee Evans (Mouse Hunt), who is sometimes charmingly clumsy and sometimes cloying and overbroad.
Aside from such tone-deaf lapses, director Gordon Chan, who shares writing credit with four others, observes the conventions of the Jackie Chan style while adding a layer of high-tech polish to the proceedings.
The movie's action scenes are choreographed by Chan's childhood friend Sammo Hung, the veteran Hong Kong director and actor best known in the United States from his stint on the TV series Martial Law.
Hung's playful take on martial-arts style perfectly matches Chan's own comic bent; together they pack more wit into a simple chase than most action movies do into their most elaborate showdowns.
It is that wit that is the sorriest loss in the turn to special effects. Anybody can fly with a green screen and wires, but it takes a creative mind to figure out a way for one little guy to whomp a roomful of opponents all by himself.",1073347200,,3380,4.869791666666667

Some of the stunts here were done in his old movies before (that is before he went international) & truth to be told, there isn't much new stunts to be seen here.  The premise of this movie is promising enough with actors such as John Rhys Davies (from Indiana Jones trilogy & Lord of the Rings fame), Julian Sand (Warlock), Claire Florani (Meet Joe Black, Mystery Men), Lee Evans (Mouse Trap), & even Asian stars such as Connie Chung (still in her best physical form after giving birth to a child).  However, the script let this movie down big time as it's SO predictable & I'm sure that a child would have figured out the ending even before it finishes.  In order to appeal to a wider audience, Hollywood tends to pair Jackie with another actor & in this instance, Lee Evans who uses Charlie Chaplin's slapstick movements in contrast with Tucker's loud mouth's persona.  The whole movie has been too formulaic & one can notice the rigidity between the actors & actresses.  I find it an utter disappointment.  I honestly think that this is more or less a B-movie & to have it endorsed by Tri-star is quite unbelievable.  I would believe it if ""The Medallion"" comes from Hong Kong but I'm dead certain that standards of movie-making in Hollywood has upped quite considerably since offering such as ""Matrix"" & ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogies.  Either I have too high of an expectation or that Jackie is trapped in his time capsule that audience has moved on since his hype in the 80's.  I still enjoy Jackie Chan's earlier movies than this.  Nowadays, he resorts too much to artificial slings & artificial effects to give him deft moves that he used to take for granted years ago.  There is definitely a better movie elsewhere.",1072569600,,1931,4.614035087719298
1940611,5,B0000SX9N2,I laughed out loud several times and I enjoyed the action scenes. did I mention that Lee Evans is a little annoying but he's hilarious.,1072137600,,135,4.44
1940612,1,B0000SX9N2,"What the hell was I thinking?Paying to go see the Medallion expect a great Jackie Chan movie. I loved Rush Hour 1 and 2,The Tuxedo was a pretty good film,but this is total crap! The acting is terrible,(Jackie Chan not only can't act,he can't even seem to FIGHT here),and there's no plot whatsoever. Anyway you choose to look at it,this movie sucks! As an action flick,there aren't really any proper fights in it,and as a comedy,it's a one-joke film,with one joke that has been repeated over a million times over 200 years,and was never at all funny to start off with! Don't watch it.",1071878400,,583,4.615384615384615
