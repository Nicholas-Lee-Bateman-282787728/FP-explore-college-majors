254426,5,6300215490,"The best comedy ever made. Impresive script,  full of comedy and, at the same time, very modern for its times. Preston Sturges is the real genius of the filmmaking, forget about Hitchcock, Welles or Ford. Sturges is the number one.",1013904000,2,231,4.775
254427,5,6300215490,"To me, ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" is the ""Citizen Kane"" of comedy -- the greatest film comedy of all time.  Eddie Bracken, Preston Sturges and William Demarest all should have gotten Oscars -- what the heck, even Betty Hutton should have gotten an Oscar for this!  All the character actors are wonderful, but I especially like Al Bridge's portrayal of a sympathetic lawyer (Al Bridge usually was consigned to playing villains in B-westerns).  This is also a great Christmas movie -- a sort of unsentimental ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (surely Capra made his masterpiece somewhat under the influence of this film).  The lines of dialogue sparkle like diamonds.  Is there any line of this film you could cut?  No!  Can I say the same for Shakespeare's ""Hamlet""?",1006214400,6,760,4.890625
254428,5,6300215490,"Great movies are those you can't bear to see end, no matter how many times you've seen 'em. They play new the second, third, tenth time around; catching the light at angles you'd never seen them in before, gaining richness and profundity in familiar details while throwing never-noticed subtleties into sudden high relief. They awaken you to reserves of emotion inside yourself plumbed so rarely, you'd almost forgotten you had them in you all along. They are one-to-one experiences - even if you see a film like Preston Sturges' MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK in a packed revival house laughing uproariously en masse, you can only share a surface pleasure with the strangers around you: the deeper joys of this movie are yours and yours alone, shocking you into an awareness of how potent a great film can be with the force of a seismic shift. Even when you encounter [a silly] review that completely, callously, misses the whole point, you can't even get angry - how could you? A STAR WARS or Tarantino fan chucking terms like 'dated' or 'foolish' at a Preston Sturges movie is too pitiable a wretch to deserve actual scorn: maybe one day they'll figure it out, if they're lucky. MIRACLE turns out to be aptly titled, as this heady, unduplicable blend of slapstick, sitcom, surrealism and sharply observed slice-of-life manages to embody WW2-era popular entertainment while standing as far apart and above its contemporaries as possible. The genius of Sturges was not that he ran end-runs around the censors, but that he subverted them from the safest place to do so: deep within the fortress of the Production Code. The story of a small-town girl who finds herself both married and unmarried at the same time - but DEFINITELY pregnant in either case - is nonstop funny and brimming with heart and honest sentiment, yet it's never less than a devastating indictment of the kind of mean-spirited provincialism that brought such things as the Code into being in the first place. Rather than single out exemplary performances, I direct you instead to the complete cast-list. The mark of a Preston Sturges movie is a wealth of expert actors, each blessed with scenes and dialogue devised to play to their respective strengths: thus, the Esther Howards and Porter Halls shine as indelibly in small roles as the leads (Bracken, Hutton, Lynn & Demarest, all inspired). If you haven't yet seen this unforgettable jewel, beat a path to wherever it is you have to beat a path to and rectify the situation immediately. You should be ready for your second viewing about three minutes after the end credits run.",998697600,3,2595,4.873303167420814
254429,5,6300215490,"We finally added this movie to our collection a few weeks ago and I have to say that I think it is Betty Hutton and Eddie Bracken's best film together. Only Hutton could play the part of Trudy the way she did, but I believe that Bracken makes this movie with his great portrayal of Norval with his high blood pressure, all the time insisting that he is as ""cool as ice"". He and Hutton have plenty of help from William Demarest, as Trudy's flustered father, and Diana Lynn, who does an excellent job as Trudy's level-headed sister. This kind of comedy is right up my alley; I love watching and laughing at this movie, especially ""the spots!"" Definitely another Sturges masterpiece.",974764800,6,680,4.581967213114754
254430,1,6300215490,"Betty Hutton is fabulous in this movie. That is the only positive thing I can say about this film. The film starts our promisingly, and then degnerates so quickly.

254431,3,6300215490,"I can appreciate that this was a good movie in its time, but I don't see it as one of the all time 100.  I admit this movie was made 30 years before I was born, so a good deal of it was probably lost on me.  I agree that it was a cute movie, and that the story was probably cutting edge for the time (with the pregnancy of the unwed teenager) but I didn't find it uproaringly funny.  I am a fan of classic movies, but I think that comedies probably translate the least over time, so this movie is somewhat lost on me.  If you grew up in the time period of this movie, I am sure you will find it lovable and it is definitely worth sitting down for.  If you are much younger and are approaching classic movies for the first time, I would recommend Eddie Bracken's ""Hail the Conquering Hero"" over this one.  Some of the same stumbling, bumbling humor but I found it more entertaining.",970358400,3,881,4.093023255813954
254432,5,6300215490,"THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK is that it was ever made at all! I'm not going to ruin the plot of this screwball delight by revealing just why! (Critic James Agee wrote that the Production Code must have been  ""raped in it's sleep""!). Betty Hutton is terrific as Trudy  Kockenlocker and she has SUCH boundless energy, one feels exhausted just  watching her perform! (all Hutton performances were manic and kinetic).  Eddie Bracken plays Norval in his usual cornball way and Diana Lynn is very  appealing as Trudy's ambitious little sis Emmy. Bill Demerest really scores  as the gruff dad who's completely disheveled by the film's end. 100 minutes  of undiluted joy.",958435200,,664,4.927927927927928

This film is pure delight, a lot of fun and very daring for its times. Eddie Bracken is hilarious as the  innocent Norval, and so are Betty Hutton and Diana Lynn. Great war-time  comedy that is pure fun. Highly recommended, a guaranteed good time and  great fun. If you're looking for a very funny comedy, look no further.  Preston Sturges shows us he has the 'magic' touch. From a scale of 1-10 I  give this movie a 9!",952128000,,530,4.536842105263158

254435,5,6300215490,"There are some wonderfully hilarious moments in this wartime farce, and great acting, especially by the two leads, Betty Hutton and Eddie Bracken, and William Demarest (Uncle Charlie from My Three Sons!) as the angry  father.  This is a real gem!!",937180800,2,247,5.0
254506,5,6300215490,"This is a hilarious World War II era comedy written and directed by Preston Sturges.  It stars Eddie Bracken and Betty Hutton and co stars William Demarest.  Keeping in mind the era, this is a somewhat daring movie.  Betty Hutton ends up in a ""family way"" after meeting and marrying a soldier while intoxicated and then loses track of him.  Eddie Bracken is in love with her and wishes to help her.

With that in mind, the film has one of the funniest scenes in any movie that I have ever seen.  Eddie Bracken tries to remarry Betty Hutton using a false name.  He is terrified and cannot carry it off.  All I can say is that you need to see it.

There was a previous movie written and directed by Preston Sturges named ""The Great McGinty"".  That movie is not a comedy.  In that movie there is a corrupt governor played by Brian Donlevy and a political boss played by Akim Tamiroff.  These two fine actors reenact these roles in this comedy.  For me it is fun to see these two movies in chronological order.

Similarly, William Demarest and Eddie Bracken also reappear in the next Preston Sturges comedy from the World War II era, named ""Hail The Conquering Hero"".  Personally I enjoy watching these three movies as a self made up trilogy.  It just sort of makes up a fun viewing experience and as a self styled student of Hollywood History, I enjoy the entire experience.  Thank You...",1487548800,,1385,4.476
254507,5,6300215490,Absolutely hilarious.  Preston Sturges is a comedy genius.  Eddie Bracken is a sweet hoot.  The whole premise of the movie was daring for its time and it is amazing that it is as funny as it is.  A true laugh riot..,1481846400,,215,4.170731707317073

254509,5,6300215490,"Deservedly renowned screwball comedy by Preston Sturges. Betty Hutton's remarkable gift for comedy, both subtle and slapstick, is on full display. She's a true pleasure to watch. Eddie Bracken is convincing as a self-effacing oaf -- and yet also, in a few crucial scenes, as a man of moving sincerity and depth. (His outer-borough New York City accent seems rather odd for a story set in mid-America, but apparently nobody cared about the disconnect.) William Demarest is hilarious as Betty's father, though he does chew the scenery a bit. And Akim Tamiroff, reprising a role from an earlier Sturges film, uproariously steals the scene in a minor cameo.

There must be an amazing backstory about how Sturges got this storyline past the 1940's era censors. All I can say is that the movie is mind-boggling in that respect.",1459209600,,821,4.949275362318841

""Going My Way,"" also released the same year and winner of the Best Picture Oscar, is a fine film. but sometimes its mawkish sentimentality gets in the way of the comic chemistry of Barry Fitzgerald and Bing Crosby.

254643,1,6300215490,"My introduction to Preston Sturges was this movie. It dissuaded me from pursuing further comedies written and directed by him. I could not believe how unworthwhile the humor is in this. Betty Hutton has a pregnancy which has the potential to become a social scandal, even though the truth was that she got married suddenly and forgot who she married because she bumped her head, and her new husband left her. She has a very intimidating fuddy-duddy father, William Demarest (typecast in that kind of role), and goes to great lengths to hide her pregnancy. Eddie Bracken is her love interest and is extremely dorky, to the point of really annoying me whenever he regains his simplistic, starry-eyed perspective and wants to act like the knight in shining armor. He is what really killed this comedy for me, but it wasn't very funny to me even without him. It's often hard to define why something is funny or not, but in this movie, I can put into words three factors of why I didn't find it funny: 1) Eddie Bracken is such a caricatured, starry-eyed dork, 2) the comedy almost entirely revolves around deception (which I think is a rather uncreative form of comedy), and 3) the ending. (See next paragraph.)

The ending is so dumb that whatever remaining hope I had for the movie being slightly funny went out the window. The Axis powers are in panic because Betty Hutton has sextuplets. There's a level of implausibility that makes something funny, but this is implausible that just makes it STUPID.

254694,5,6300215490,"This has got to be one of the funniest, hilarious, zaniest, outrageous movies of its time. Preston Struges, was one of the top writers then directors for Paramount Studios when he made this film. He was the type of man to have a crazy scene in there some kind of way. Another thing about him is that he sprinkled the word sex in his movies pretty liberally. Supposedly, it was made in 1941,1942, delayed a while, some say due to the nature of the film, and hmm, I could see why if that be the case. Some say for other reasons; Either way, with all the tampering, changes, what have you, you still come up with this. Now you have this young girl Trudy Knockenhocker played with relish by Betty Hutton, who is the daughter of the local policeman William Demarest(who gave a sterling performance); It's World War 2, the boys are leaving town, and Trudy wants to go to the party the town is holding for the boys leaving for war. ok, but the father, doesn't want her to go; So she gets Norval Jones, her 4F dependable buddy, who also loves the proverbial ground she walks on(played by Eddie Bracken)to say they were going to the movies. well, she ditches him there and goes to the ball; Now first off the bat, when Trudy leaves supposedly going to the movies in a ball gown and William Demarest doesn't get the hint, something ain't right. Let me not neglect to add Diana Lynn who plays her little but wise knowing sister; So, Norval gets stuck at the movies, Trudy has the time of her life at the ball; And boy what a time. So much so, she has a memory lapse due to her drinking too much champagne, and is late picking Norval up that has folks thinking he took advantage of her; Oh if they only knew...Anyhow, Trudy ends up noticing this ring on her finger but she vaguely remembers the details. Now folks, even in this day and time, we look at women kind of funny for that to an extent, but in those days, THAT WAS A NO NO! and to show it in the movies, BIG NO NO!! To this day, I still wonder how The Hays Office let this movie come off the lot to theaters. But moving on, the night is forgotten but then old Trudy ends up pregnant (OH HORROR!) and now she's got a dillemma; She can't remember the name of the man, only some funny name and that they all use fake names to marry. So lil sister cooks up a scheme to let Norval take the fall and marry her. Now mind you, the fella only loved her from Day One, so for him it was a big opportunity, but for her it was a way out of a funky situation. So, she comes up with the idea of him dressing up in a uniform (WW1)and go somewhere to get married with fake names, but when they kissed and stated their real names afterwards, the license folks got wise and bring in the law all the way to the state government gets involved in this one girl's business.

254727,5,6300215490,"Preston Sturges, writer-director of this wonderful picture was a master!  He set the bar at Paramount in the 1940s for comedy and this is a prime example.

It is great stuff indeed.  With a cast that could not be bettered, this is one of the funniest films ever made.  It starts off fast paced and there is not one single moment the screen is idle.

Betty Hutton gives a great performance and she was only 22 years old at the time.  This film was her breakthrough in Hollywood and she is charming and endearingly funny.

Eddie Bracken is marvelous as the leading man with the funny face and the stutter.  In my opinion he should have gotten nominated for an academy award.  I think he is the glue that holds the film together!!

William Demarest (later Uncle Charley on Tv's ""My Three Sons"") as Betty's father is deliciously hammy and bombastic.

Diana Lynn, fourteen at the time, plays the kid sister with acerbic aplomb and sarcastic wit.  She is amazing.  Watch the scene toward the end when she and Betty are tying Bill Demarest in the jail cell and she conks him on the head.....what a howler!!

This film is hilarious and for the time it was made...at the height of WWII, was a refreshing escape from the madness that was going on in the world at the time.

When you have a couple of hours on a rainy Saturday morning or you feel like a good movie on a late night, a movie to make you feel good and that will make you laugh your head off, I recommend this classic!  Comedy doesn't get any better than this!!",1209081600,10,1513,4.369175627240144
254728,3,6300215490,"I saw this film on TV...Late, a few nights ago.  I loved it and found it extremely funny. It takes place (and was filmed) during World War II and set in small town America.  The story line involves a young girl who feels that it is her patriotic duty to ""see the boys off to war"".  She is told by her father that she can't go out to party with soldiers and talks the boy that has been in love with her since childhood to take her out.  She convinces him to let her take his car and wait for her to come back to the movie theater,  she never intended to see the movie with him.  She comes back in the morning drunk and married. She doen't know who the groom was since they used false names. She soon finds that she is pregnant without a husband and no wedding certificate to prove she was ever married. The boy who loves her tries to help her by marrying her.  The poor boy goes from one bad situation to another. Both Betty Hutton and Eddie Bracken were very good in this, but I enjoyed the supporting cast just as much, especially Diana Lynn, who played the younger sister that had more maturity at fourteen than her older sister.

I purchased the movie so I could share it with a few friends. After my copy arrived, I watched it with my daughter-in-law.  Most of the humor went right past her. The basic premise of the movie may slip by some viewers in the generation after mine, since pregnancy without marriage is so commonplace and it is accepted now. There are also quite a few references that not everyone under 40 might ""get"". That being said, I feel it is a very funny and nostalgic look at what America was (in a comic sense) like before TV, Microwaves, cell phones, and smart bombs.  Bottom line: If you are a senior, buy it and enjoy it with your friends. If you're young watch it for it's sheer comic value.",1205539200,12,1820,4.234104046242774

It is interesting to see Hutton here out of her element. She does not sing, nor does she seem to be the only ham in the show. Bracken is her equal, which is what makes this movie work so well. The two are an excellent team.

254733,5,6300215490,"A walk through a cultural museum of societal hypocrisy, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, 1944 lambastes the mores of the 1940's.  Since the action takes place in a small Mid-Western town with the usual local yokels and the newly arrived GI's, boy's and girls do without the preliminaries as the privates are marched to the grim reaper.  The girls give it up with romantic heroism.  The fumbling in the dark after an evening of spiked lemonade causes pregnancy and social chaos.  Betty Hutton is the prettiest girl in town and the most innocent soon-to-be mother in history thanks to the movie code and sexual regulations left over from the 19th Century.  She got married, but to whom? No sex without marriage of course, but what a convoluted script to get this idea across as to preserve the GI pin-ups honor. The laughs burst from the cover up.  Preston Sturges, a true genius, pumped it up to the hokey, sentimental climax.  Slapstick and screwball comedy are melded to a script that can be described as a screenplay converted to a play and then regurgitated to a film.  The scenes are very long and the actors walk the town as though they were on a stage.  You have to see the lack of quick cuts to understand what I mean. It just doesn't look like a Hollywood film.

Much has been said about the in-house players that worked in Sturges' films.  William Demarest is hilarious, a pratfall a minute.  Eddie Braken practically invents the lovable nerd.  Diana Lynn is the most sarcastic teen ever.  McGinty is the Governor of the Great State of Anywhere.  All these stereotypes are immortalized in a million films since.

Bracken is brilliant and I think this is Hutton's best film.  The censorship code during wartime prevented this film from being released right away when it was completed, so perhaps we should be fortunate it exists at all.  Audiences too recognized they were seeing an outrageous, risque, ultimately derisive comedy about wartime Americans and especially the young women and soldiers who often lived for today in those perilous times. (On the Universal set, the equally magnificent ""Hail The Conquering Hero"" makes a good bookend for wartime satire.)

Sturges merited Academy Awards for best writing for six of his films, including ""Miracle,"" but at least he won for 1940s ""The Great McGinty.""  The Paramount disc is also quite inexpensive.",1166659200,5,1069,5.2105263157894735

Betty Hutton plays an exuberant small town girl who wants to show the soldiers on leave a good time before they head off to war and in doing so, parties, marries and falls pregnant in one night, a night of which she has almost no memory. Eddie Bracken plays the nerd who loves her and comes to her rescue when she can not recall whom she married.

Hutton and Bracken are superb, hilarious in the slapstick but also very moving in the more tender moments. The supporting cast are also brilliant as in all of Sturges's films. William Demarest has a large part as Hutton's angry father and Diana Lynn plays her facetious sister. Both have some great lines but Lynn almost steals the show with her cynical delivery. The film is framed with scenes of Brian Donlevy as ""The Great McGinty"" and Akim Tamiroff as the mayor, a throwback to an earlier Sturges film. You may have to see the film a few times to savour all their one liners. Sturges often uses long takes and the actors' skill with the dialogue is impressive.

The print of the film is excellent and the extras consist of 2 documentaries, one about Sturges and one about censorship. Clearly edited from the same interviews, they benefit from the presence of Sturges's widow and Eddie Bracken himself. It is particularly amusing to hear Bracken speak of the hypocrisy of the censors and how the director and cast were laughing at their stupidity as the film was made.

254790,4,6300215490,"A smalltown goodtime girl named Trudy Kockenlocker (Betty Hutton) goes off with a group of soldiers before they're sent off to war; the next morning she has vague memories of marrying one of them--someone, she says, like a name like ""Ratzskywatzsky""--but with no memory of who exactly or where to find him. Soon after she finds out she's pregnant, and pressures the 4-F boy next door (Eddie Bracken) to help her out of her predicament.

All Preston Sturges comedies are worth your time if only because they all manage to be so funny while also being so innovative from a narrative perspective: Sturges loved playing with stories within stories, and yet does it so simply and hilariously as only to enhance the story's pleasure. (The framing device of the governor hearing the news and sorting all the problems out at the end as deus ex machina seems like a comic trick borrowing from Molire.) But the story also broke tremendous ground by dint of its subject matter, which only barely got past the Hays Code censors; if you're familiar with the films of the time, the fact that Private Ratzskywatzsky never appears by the story's end to reclaim Trudy or their issue will seem astonishing. (All the same, the film was a huge hit.)

The film has much going for it besides Sturges's direction and writing. Not the least of these is Betty Hutton, who got perhaps the best role she ever had as the overenthusiastic Trudy. Hutton is all but forgotten today, but she was one of the few stars of Broadway musical comedy who made a very successful transition to Hollywood. Unlike Ethel Merman or Zero Mostel, whose enormous theatrical energies seemed artificial for the screen, Hutton succeeded because her over-the-top desperation seemed at its best (as here) incredibly sincere, and so her funniest moments are when she gives way so mercurially to her change of feelings with such zest and extremity. One of my favorite moments is when her father forbids her to go out to the dance with the soldiers; within a moment she goes from utter elation to blank depression, and she walks up the stairs with such disappointment in her spine that she's deeply endearing. Eddie Bracken's nervous nerdish comedy has aged less well than Hutton's hyperenthusiasm, perhaps, and the film suffers from its somewhat patronizing vision of smalltown life. (Sturges's comedies work best when he is making fun of sophisticates rather than just rubes, as in SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS or THE PALM BEACH STORY--he's at his best when he shows the wealthy and privileged to be just as apt towards enacting or being taken in by utterly harebrained schemes as is the middle class.) But the film has two fantastic assets in William Demarest as Trudy's crotchety father and Diana Lynn doing her funny specialty at adolescent knowingness as Trudy's incredibly sane younger sister. There's a great slapstick bit Sturges works up that whenever Lynn sasses her father Demarest tries to give her a flying kick in the pants, which he invariably mistimes so that he falls flat on his back.",1131148800,26,3037,4.872340425531915

""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" had just started and we had never seen anything quite like it. A good Sturges movie is as close as you can get to a rollercoaster ride without going to an amusement park. And this movie is as wild a ride as any Sturges movie.

I have seen this movie a number of times over the last 30 years and each time I am almost doubling over with laughter.  I can't wait to get it on DVD.

For a few years in the 1940s Preston Sturges was a brilliant shinning star.  As far as I am concerned, he never shone brighter than he did in this ""Miracle.""",1118620800,8,906,4.226744186046512
254795,4,6300215490,"Betty Hutton stars in ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" as Trudy Kockenlocker, a young small-town girl.  As the film opens, Trudy is extremely excited about an upcoming party to send off the local men to fight in WWII.  She schemes to attend the party, despite being forbid by her overprotective father (the brilliant William Demarest).  As the night goes on, the party gets more and more wild, ending in Betty unexpectedly married and pregnant.  The only problem is that she cannot remember getting married or to whom.  To solve her dilemma, she resolves to get married to a local boy, the inept and frightened Norval Jones, played by Eddie Bracken.  The situation spins completely out of control from here.

""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" was written and directed by the peerless Preston Sturges.  The film is on par with his greatest, such as ""Hail the Conquering Hero.""  Bracken would go on to star ""Hail"" as well, but his performance here is arguably his best.  Playing the nerdy Norvel who ""sees spots"" when he gets nervous, Bracken is perfect.  Betty Hutton also would never have a better role; unfortunately, she really never attained the status she deserved.

The film's humor is rather zesty, and the pregnancy plot is handled in a relative frank manner, making for a bit of a surprise for a 1940s movie.  The script manages to be touching as well as funny, eliciting some genuine laughs.  In particular, Diana Lynn steals the show as Hutton's precocious teen sister, Emmy.  The chemistry between Emmy and her father is fantastic.  The film deservedly received an Oscar nomination for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), losing to ""Wilson.""

Despite its quality, ""Miracle"" is definitely not as well known as other Sturges classics.  However, it stands up against the greatest comedies of this period; accordingly it was added to the US Film Registry in 2001.

The next morning she wakes up at home feeling like Hell, but that's just the beginning of it: she's pregnant and doesn't even know who the father is! Remember this is 1944! All she can remember is she thinks she married some guy named ""Ratzkiwatzki"" or something like that. Devastated by this news she doesn't know what to do so she devises a plan to quickly marry Norval Jones, who's been in love with her for years, but when she sees how deeply he's in love she can't trick him like that so...well, I've already told you too much, but take my word for is this movie is hilarious. The first time I saw it I literally laughed until I was crying and my sides hurt so bad I thought I was going to puke.

From a filmmaker's standpoint TMOMC is notable for some great long shots, especially Trudy and Norval's walk when she tell him she's pregnant. It's nearly 4 minutes long and physically covers a lot of ground, but the audience probably never notices it because their too busy laughing at Norval's constant screaming. Also notice how those long scenes are only during the first half of the movie, later on as the excitement grows the shots become shorter and shorter, not to mention a lot more people show up until you have some great Sturges crowd scenes where you have five people talking at once and it's all funny.

I love this movie and cannot say enough things about it. Brilliant script and direction by a true Hollywood master and the acting! How did Eddie Bracken not get at least nominated for an Oscar for his role here? He was hilarious. And lets not forget Sturges normal actors...of his 38 frequent actors 22 were here. Most notable was William Demarest as Trudy's gruff and tough father, Constable Edmund Kockenlocker.

I would really like to know if it's even possible for Hollywood to make a movie like this anymore? Made back in 1944 the story talks nonstop about sex and marriage, but yet it's completely clean language-wise and without any gross-out humor. Everything was done so subtly and so full of satire that it somehow got passed the Hays Office! I love crude humor as much as the next person, but I would be thrilled beyond belief if somebody started making clean screwball comedies like this today. Some of the comedies by Howard Hawks, Preston Sturges, Jack Conway, Frank Capra and Leo McCarey were so rich that I can watch them countless times and never get bored. I've had to have seen THE AWFUL TRUTH easily over 400 times. And I've seen THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK at least 20. Highly recommended.

She takes this marriage thing all the way, so to speak, and is impregnated....and cannot remember who she married or what name she or he used.

Then there's the poor but standup moon-eyed sap who's loved her for years, who displays tremendous chivalry by trying to figure out how to marry her and give the child a father without committing bigamy.

These days there'd be no marriage, the sap wouldn't have a chance, and grampa would raise the baby in spite of himself while the dingy blonde runs off to escape any responsibility.

But I'm getting about 60 years ahead of myself.

As it is, this little-remembered classic comedy is more than just a laugh riot, which it is.  It's more than just a bit of WWII nostalgia, which it is.  It's also a wistful reminder of innocent days gone by, days when people were like this, although certainly not as much like this as the movies would have us believe.

I always think of William Demerest as the grumpy old Uncle Charlie from TV's ""My Three Sons,"" but he was grumpy long before TV was popular.  Here he portrays the town constable and single father of two teen daughters, and is at his absolute grumpiest.  Having just seen him as Henry Fonda's bodyguard in ""The Lady Eve,"" another Sturges film, it's a treat to see him in an even more physically comedic role here.  The old guy is a riot when it comes to broad comedy.  What a mug!

I don't remember having heard of Eddie Bracken before, as this was all before my time.  He's something of an anemic Donald O'Connor without rhythm, portraying a mid 20th century version of Ben Stiller's character in ""There's Something About Mary,"" a much less hilarious film than this.  Bracken plays the poor sap noted above, who ultimately, through the titular ""miracle,"" becomes a national hero after first becoming the ultimate local bad guy.  He deserves neither title, but it gives little away to state that he does get the girl.  And he deserves her...and about a half-dozen other surprises.

""Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them.""

It's so perverse you can hardly believe the film was made in the 1940s; were all the censors busy snipping hot passages out of soldiers' love letters?  As for the performances, they are supercharged with vitality (though Hutton appears actually to be holding herself in at times, a rarity indeed), and there are some who will not recognize William Demarest and Diana Lynn from their other roles, so stylized are they here.  It's up to the individual viewer to admit how much this turns him or her on or off, but it makes TMOMC a film unlike any other of the period, distinct even from the other Sturges classics.  Lynn reminds Hutton not to miss a certain ""little boogie-woogie joint,"" and Demarest rears up like a cobra and demands to know, ""What do you know about a little boogie-woogie joint?""  (She's supposed to be 14, though she acts 45, like Bette Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE.)  With great scorn, she pulls back and snaps, ""Only that you go there, Daddy,"" pause, ""digging a trench,"" oozing contempt viscous as an oil slick.

If they made the movie today, of course, Demarest would be revealed as having sexually abused both daughters, and I think some of this sex tension comes through the movie anyway, so you can readily understand why Hutton would be so eager to run off dating every soldier who passes through the ""church basement and the country club.""",1102550400,4,1647,4.734265734265734

To sum up, in the small town of Morgan's Creek of 1943, Trudy (played wonderfully by Betty Hutton) helps ""send the boys off to war"" so to speak and finds out afterwards that she is both married and pregnant.  With no idea who the father is, Trudy (with help from her younger sister) plots to marry Norval (the irrepressable Eddie Bracken in what may be his finest role), a 4-F soldier-wannabe whose been in love with Trudy since she was ""knee-high to a fire hydrant"" or something like that.

(Norval's condition of getting so nervous that he sees ""The Spots!"", is used to great effect during the film.)

What follows is probably the most over-the-top, insanely funny sequence of events that eventually reaches world-wide proportions.

William Demerest is unforgettable as the put-upon father whose at odds with his two daughters. His constant bickering with Emmy (Diana Lynn), his younger daughter, is absolutely priceless and for me the highlight of the film.

For Sturges fans, the appearence of Brian Donlevy and Akim Tamiroff reprising their roles from ""The Great McGinty"" will be a particular delight.  Donlevy has one of the best lines when he declares ""the miracle"" to be the biggest thing to hit his state ""since we stole it from the Indians!"".

A couple of notes; First off, the idea that Trudy got drunk during the ""send off"" is sheer nonsense.  She is never seen drinking anything, save for her sip of the ""Victory Lemonade"" (which is later established to be spiked).  But the look on her face is enough to let you know that she didn't have anymore of the stuff.

Secondly, Sturges received two nominations for Best Original Screenplay for ""Miracle"" & ""Hail, The Conquering Hero!"" in 1944.  A rare event indeed.

And now, this flick is on DVD! Finally!",1096416000,6,2058,4.859598853868195
254831,5,6300215490,"Had the undiluted pleasure of watching ""Morgan's Creek"" twice in one night on  Turner Classic Movies ... talk about OD!!  Wonderful!!  The same frenetic pacing as my all-time favorite comedy, Billy Wilder's ""One, Two, Three""; funny, funny lines and characterizations;  and (listen to it) a near-perfect musical score.  This is one of the comedy greats.
BUT ... I see where a number of reviewers claim that Trudy gets drunk, and so does not remember the evening.  No, no, a thousand times NO!  She says repeatedly that she has never drunk a drop.  Watch what actually happens:  (1) Trudy hates the ""Victory Punch"" (no sugar!) so does NOT drink it ... (2) then during a swing boogie dance she is thrown up in the air ... and (3) hits her head on the mirror-ball and is knocked senseless.
Sturges may have been playing with the morals of the time, but he was nonetheless a traditionalist himself.",1066521600,3,893,4.709677419354839

Mr. Speilberg, with all due respect..I would replace most of your films with "" The Lady Eve"" "" The Great McGinty"" and "" Hail The Conquering Hero"" et all..

I agree with Mr. Schrader. "" The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" is a unique film experience!  Mr. Bracken is missed sorely now but we can see him on display in films like these !

254833,5,6300215490,"During the censorious era of Hollywood's Production Code, a few brave filmmakers stretched the limits of censorship. MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK is one of writer/director Preston Sturges' top screwball war-time comedies, which was considered a controversial, bold, and irreverent farce at the time, due to its scandalous content. Trudy Kockenlocker (read that name carefully), a small-town girl from Morgan's Creek, attends an all-night party with servicemen from the local army base, gets drunk, and marries one of the soldiers. She finds herself pregnant, then can't remember which soldier she married. She convinces bankclerk/4-F reject Norval Jones to marry her and pretend to be the father. Before the film ends, Trudy gives birth to sextuplets and the young couple become national celebrities (I don't even wanna think how much controversy this cause upon its release).

The censors were just as upset that Sturges was making fun of the war effort, as much as they were for an unmarried pregnant girl being the heroine of the film. Imagine a GI getting a girl pregnant and leaving the parenting to a draft reject! The censors insisted on numerous changes before the film's release, delaying it for a year. With all the tampering, the basic idea, that Trudy slept with a drunk soldier, forgot his name, and got pregnant, came across loud and clear.
The film satirizes the wartime idolatry of soldiers and the innocent, faithful girls they left behind. Today, the idea that an unwed mother brought terrible disgrace seems rather quaint, but it certainly did skirt the production code quite a bit. Represented is a woman having sex with a soldier and not even remembering his name; you have a male lead who is positioned as an almost gay character, someone who can't even fight in the army; you have a number of people in high places who do not act in anything resembling an honorable way. The movie directly attacks the code and its bylaws by having the town willing to shun Trudy, until she puts it on the map by having sextuplets. The film is a stranger to small-town American life as idealized in the films of Frank Capra. Sturges was even described as the anti-Capra by French critic Andre Bazin. His small towns were not the pie-baking heartland. The inhabitants are diverse and irritable, not noble, kind or understanding, and show the turmoil beneath the facade of a placid rural life.
The film is brilliant on all levels. It is funny, shocking, and sweet. This is definitely one of the best comedies ever made, and definitely recommended!!!",1044230400,6,2550,4.957943925233645
254834,5,6300215490,"In a way, this is quite a perverse film.  Trudy Kockenlocker (energetically portrayed by a very young Betty Hutton) goes out to a dance, drinks a little too much punch, and awakes the next day with a paper ring around her finger, and the vague memory that someone suggested that everyone in the party go get married, in her case ""perhaps"" to someone named something like Yatskywatsky.  A few weeks later, she finds herself pregnant, and unaware of who the father/her husband might be.  She then plots to snag Norval Jones (Eddie Bracken), the quintessential 4-F local boy, as a husband to save her from local shame.  Those are the bare bones of the story, but Sturges enriches it with enormously rich and clever dialog to create one of the great film comedies.  Some might find the onscreen personalities of Bracken and Hutton a bit too pungent, but most others will find them hysterical in a manic, slapstickish way.  William Demarest, as Officer Kockenlocker, Trudy's father, steals the film in what is almost certainly his greatest screen role.
The narrative of the film is structured around a phone call to Governor McGinty.  For those who haven't seen Sturges's first directorial effort, Brian Donlevy played the title role in THE GREAT McGINTY and Akim Tamiroff played ""The Boss.""  They reprise those roles in cameos here.
A very great film comedy.  Perhaps not quite as outstanding as SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS or THE LADY EVE, but nonetheless still on the short list of the great film comedies of the 1940s.",1040947200,12,1508,4.859375
254835,5,6300215490,"I'm not a believer in contests for film or music...perception and appreciation are so subjective, how can something be unequivocally a 'best'? However, this amazing film by the master Sturges comes close to being the exception to my rule. The first time I saw it, my jaw just dropped: how did he ever get away with the subject matter at a time when practically nothing sexual was allowed to be seen or discussed on screen?? Married couples couldn't even be shown sleeping in the same bed! Yet here was a WILDLY irreverent film about a woman who can't rememeber who slept with her and fathered her child. I still don't know why Paramount agreed to make it and release it. The dialogue and performances are perfect; Sturges really doesn't set a foot wrong. It comes as close to 'perfection' as any film comedy ever has. Watch this one, then watch the rest of Sturges' films...again and again and again. And read a biography or two of this amazing man as well, he lived an extraordinary life and died too young. Why do you think the Coen Brothers worship him?",1021334400,2,1056,4.592592592592593

How on earth did Preston Sturges sneak this story past WW2-era censors? No idea, but I'm glad he did.

7806162,5,6300215490,"Almost every movie taht Preston Sturges directed is a classic comedy. In just four years Sturges gave the world  ""The Great McGinty,"" ""Christmas in July,"" ""The Lady Eve,"" ""Sullivan's Travels,"" ""The Palm Beach Story,"" ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek,"" and ""Hail the Conquering Hero.""  Out of all of those great movies, ""The Miracle of Morgan Creek"" is his best

""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" is even more outrageous than his other movies.  Early in World War II, the heroine, Trudy Kockenlocker (Betty Hutton), goes to a dance for soldiers who are about to leave for the front. She conks her head and in the morning the only thing she can remember is that she married a soldier named Ratzkywatzky or something like that. Since everyone used made up names, that doesn't seem to be a major problem until, a few weeks later, she realizes that they did more than get married on the night of the dance. Norval Jones (Eddie Bracken), a local 4-F, tries to help by dressing in a World War I uniform and pretending to marry Trudy.  Soon, Norval is a fugitive from justice, with 19 charges against him.  Diana Lynn plays Emmy, Trudy's younger sister, who is apparently the only sane person in town.  William Demarest is great as Trudy's father.  The humor ranges from sly satire to outrageous subversion of contemporary mores to slapstick and farce.

Sturges gave fits to the censors and laughter to the audiences and never more so than in ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek.""",1520812800,,1463,4.75098814229249

7806167,5,6300215490,"I love this movie. Laugh a minute, Brilliant writing(Preston Sturges received an academy award nomination for this). Terrific cast throughout, including supporting players. Betty Hutton plays Trudy, a sweet,pretty small-town girl who goes to a see the troops off dance and comes home married and pregnant and doesn't remember any of it. Eddie Bracken is her nerdy friend who has loved her since they were kids and wants to help her out of her fix! Diana Lynn plays Trudy's sister who is 14 but wise beyond her years and has some of the best lines in the movie. Trudy's dad is William Demarest (of My 3 Sons from TV fame) who is both hilarious and warm and does some of the best slapstick ever! The lines come fast and furious and are laugh-out loud funny. While you laugh at one you may miss another they come so fast, Besides the dialogue there are some great gags as well. This is the first movie I ever saw Betty Hutton in and I think she is terrific! I knew nothing about her screen reputation so could watch just as an actress. She doesn't sing at all in this movie. She's sweet, sensitive,moving and funny as well. (Found out she was named best actress of the year by the National Board of Review). She could act extremely well when given a chance. If you have never seen her I would recommend seeing this first and then moving on to her other films(which is what I did and became a total Betty Hutton fan. She is a joy and so much fun to watch).She and Eddie are a terrific team and were in several other movies together. This film covered subjects that at the time were considered no-no by the film censors of the time but somehow Sturges got it through! I read that it was extremely popular when it came out and played to standing room only at a lot of theaters! Anyway,I loved it and consider it one of the best movies I've ever seen and will re-watch frequently- its that good!",1508198400,,1888,4.397142857142857
