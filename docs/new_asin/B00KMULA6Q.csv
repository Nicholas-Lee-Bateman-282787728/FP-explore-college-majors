6434137,5,B00KMULA6Q,"The translation from off-Broadway play to HBO film is an outstanding success. I saw the play in New York City many years ago and I had my doubts as to how well the play would translate after 30 years of AIDS treatment advances. However, the film just could not be better.  It perfectly captures the vast disruption that AIDS brought to the gay community and the amazing acts of courage and community organizing that occurred during the early days of this public health disaster.  Larry Kramers adaptation of his 1985 play continues to capture the tensions between those in the gay community that thought that the strategy for stopping the epidemic lay in constant outrage at those with political power as compared to those who thought that the strategy for stopping the epidemic lay in community organizing in partnership with public health officials and institutionalizing the response effort. The film also depicts those who brought their talents to fund raising and to the important and essential tasks of care for those impacted by the disease.  The film is fair in this debate and leaves the viewer with the impression that all types of responses and strategies were necessary to curtail the epidemic.

Mark Ruffalo, as character Ned Weeks, is outstanding in playing the angry activist who demands action, confronts hypocrisy at every opportunity.  A man who uses anger and confrontation to move the agenda forward despite making enemies in the process may eventually be unwelcome.  He is also a man who converts his grief and fear into anger as he sees the deterioration of his lover, Felix, played perfectly by Matt Bomer. The play depicts how such an approach leads to eventual alienation of allies when Ned Weeks attacks those closest to him and his co-fighters in the struggle because they fail to see his strategy as appropriate or find other ways to express their response to the epidemic other than that of angry confrontation.

Mark Ruffalo does a great job portraying the multi-layers of the character of Ned Weeks since his experiences as a Jew in our American culture also contributes to his responses to the epidemic and to his struggle for acceptance by his family. Alfred Molina does an exceptional job playing Neds older brother, Ben, who struggles with the sexual orientation of his younger brother while sympathizing with the crisis that Ben is undergoing as his entire community is struck by a plague that the heterosexual community can only partly experience.

Taylor Kitsch plays Bruce Niles, a gay man whose approach to the AIDS epidemic is to build a community care response, to institutionalize the gay response, to carefully build bridges to tentative allies, to build awareness and gather funds from the gay community, and to move strategically forward in responding to the epidemic. He and Ned Weeks are bound toward confrontation since their styles and strategies are so different.

Jim Parsons plays Tommy Boatwright, a loving sensitive gay man whose strategy is to show compassion and understanding to all those impacted by the disease, to organize and help direct the energies and grief of others toward supporting those most impacted by the AIDS epidemic. This character is essential to understanding the AIDS epidemic and the response of the gay community. There were indeed angry activists such as Ned Weeks and visionary strategists such as Bruce Niles, but there were many whose gifts lay in the area of care and compassion and Jim Parsons is absolutely great in portraying this essential character.

Julia Roberts plays Dr. Emma Brookner, a physician who had polio as a child, and thus a natural ally for Ned since she understands his grief and anger and eventually she directs her own anger to those in authority for a lethargic response to the epidemic.  Joe Mantello plays public health worker Mickey Marcus. This character is essential since gay men and women who worked in the public health infrastructure such as the CDC and local AIDS organizations had a dual roles as volunteer, activist, and leader in the community response and as a part of a vast public health infrastructure in their 8 to 5 jobs. Joe Mantellos acting skills are outstanding as you will see when you watch this film.

The film is perfect in depicting the response of the gay community to this epidemic in the early stages of this public health crisis, 1980-1985. The viewer will empathize with all these characters and their different responses to the epidemic. No one is a villain, there are no bad-guys in this drama since the bad-guy was a devastating virus that destroyed young men in the prime of life.",1405728000,31,4627,4.9561290322580644

6434140,5,B00KMULA6Q,"This film version accomplishes many goals. Firstly, it gives the author of the play, on whose experiences in the initial onslaught of the AIDS crisis it is based, the recognition and the respect he so much deserves. He is nothing less than an American hero and a great man of letters. He co-founded two of the most important AIDS organizations in history, the GMHC, a relief organization when there was no other, and the radical group ACTUP, a grass roots group that literally lay down in the streets to bring attention to the crisis. I moved to New York as a teen ager in the eighties and witnessed the horror of AIDS first hand as well as the larger horror of a government's and several political administration's blatant neglect. But behind all of this very political drama is a story. It's a story of two men and their undying love for each other and the story of a community called to action, a community that formed new families when the traditional family shut it's door on them. I'm getting older with the help of the drugs developed largely because of the efforts of men like Larry. I can't pretend to know the minds of modern young gay men, but I can't help think that they should all see this film. We have a real history as a community, and this film shows a very important part of it. Correct that, everyone should see this film.",1404518400,19,1342,4.481632653061224

This is the graphic representation of life, especially the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, among the Gay population, for it can never be broadcast to timidly.

WARNING!  This film can really be a blow to our smug-self-satisfied-egos!  We all build little miniature worlds around ourselves.  It takes a very strong movie like this, to bring us back to the real world for both Gay and/or Straight people.  Thank-you HBO for such a wonderful EPIC!  NJMJr!!

6434143,5,B00KMULA6Q,"A brilliant film of a brilliant play: The tragedy of GRID to AIDS
Larry Kramer adapted his much honored play 1985 play THE NORMAL HEART, an autobiographical reenactment of the period of time from 1980 to 1984 when the mysterious scourge of AIDS decimated thousands of gay men. Ryan Murphy sensitively directs a cast of some of the finest actors in cinema and a cadre of actors form the stage in a heart-stopping reminder of a time when it seemed the world might just be ending.

The film focuses on the rise of GRID (Gay-Related Immune Deficiency) aka the HIV-AIDS crisis in New York City between 1981 and 1984, as seen through the eyes of writer/activist Ned Weeks (Mark Ruffalo), the gay Jewish- American founder of a prominent HIV advocacy group. Ned prefers loud public confrontations to the calmer, more private strategies favored by his associates, friends, and closeted lover Felix Turner (Matt Bomer), none of whom are prepared to throw themselves into the media spotlight. Their differences of opinion lead to frequent arguments that threaten to undermine their mutual goal. But that is only part of the territory this film covers - from the newly post- Stonewall sexual freedom as highlighted on Fire Island, to the gradual finding of Kaposi's sarcoma as badges on dying men, to the nation's sexual politics as gay activists and their allies in the medical community fight to expose the truth about the burgeoning epidemic to a city and nation in denial. The film is more like and opera than a play, with extended monologues by the polio stricken Dr Emma Brookner (a magnificent Julia Roberts), the agonizing anger of Mickey Marcus (Joe Mantello in an unforgettable performance), the active but cautious Bruce Niles (Taylor Kitsch proving he can handle major roles in drama), the cautious reporter Felix Turner (Matt Bomer in a career making role) as he gradually succumbs to Aids in the arms of his lover Ned Weeks, the standard bearer Tommy Boatwright (Jim Parsons), and smaller but equally impressive roles played by Alfred Molina, Jonathan Groff, Denis O'Hare, Danielle Ferland and on and on.

But it is the towering performance by Mark Ruffalo who manages to bring the audience into the heart of the film. It is an Emmy worthy performance and certainly one for the finest roles Ruffalo has ever mastered. Cliff Martinez manages the musical score with aplomb. The film contains some nudity and some suggestive innuendos, but they all seem important to the story and are not just placed in the film for effect. This is a film that will stun, cause tears, and make a lot of older people weep at the trials of the period reflected and the losses of loved ones during that medical travesty.

6434144,5,B00KMULA6Q,"""The Normal Heart"" really traces the lives of a group of gay men living in New York in the early 1980's when AIDS first appeared on the scene. The story, based on the brilliant Larry Kramer stage play, details to masterful precision the governments refusal to help find a cure for AIDS as they perceived it as only a gay man's disease.

 ""White Collar"" actor Matt Bomer gives a virtuoso performance as a man dying of AIDS and his lover's attempt to save him and make the government (both nationally and local) to step up, take action, put money aside and find a cure for AIDS,

 Brilliantly directed and beautifully acted ""The Normal Heart"" will tug at your heart strings and remind you of what gay men went through 33 years ago with no help, no compassion and no knowledge of a dreadful disease that would kill millions.",1401321600,4,821,4.527027027027027
6434145,5,B00KMULA6Q,"After watching ""The Normal Heart"" last night on HBO, I understood much better and deeply, what the gay community has been fighting to be accepted and respected for a very long time. But what happened in the early 80's was a genocide caused by a homophobic Republican government, that to this date, keep fighting to make the members of the gay community in US a second class group. 36 million people died of AIDS because the Reagan administration refused to speak up and help the research. A lot has changed, but this movie is an important reminder of what we are fighting against and that we have to push forward, that change is happening regardless of all the death and injustice. This is a great, emotional movie with heartbreaking performances from first rate actors. Thank you HBO, for the courage to show the world this sad chapter of American history.#TheNormalHeart #HBO #Equality #GayRights #AIDS",1401321600,70,904,4.876623376623376

6434156,3,B00KMULA6Q,"[Sunday, December 31, 2017] .... I rented this movie via Amazon Prime during Christmas weekend 2017!!

If anyone remembers the AIDS movie Longtime Companion (1989/1990?); I feel like it almost parallels this movie but more updated (I guess?) I mostly watched it because of the very sexy gay actor Matt Bomer; damn hes sexy as....

I also recognized some of the male actors and main female actress Julia Roberts whose character she portrays a lady with Polio (as I too have Polio as well in a wheelchair too) but I was never ever in an electric wheelchair, like her character was!! I have always had manual wheelchairs and now a scooter 2 years old come next month, next year January 2018!!

I started crying (I tried holding my tears in but it didn't work; but since Im a lady, Im allowed to cry!!) when the 2 brothers (Mark Ruffalo and Alfred Molina) hugged in the hospital hallway via Matts characters nearing death!! I continued crying until the movie ended!!

I actually have known some gay male folks (from the past and current) who have AIDS/HIV; some died, some are still alive!!",1514678400,,1086,4.670157068062827

I don't care that a topic like this has been done and redone several times. The reviews that complain about cliche's... this epidemic does not change. How do you expect something different? It's just ridiculous. People are dying, and 'nobody' cares. People care too much about image, and the judgment of others. It's just so tragic and it really broke my heart.

Many more people would have been infected and that includes straights,  females and kids too. Anybody can get HIV or AIDS. No class race or sex of people is excluded.  Obama should have given Kramer a Presidential Freedom medal when he was handing them out to various singers and actors a few weeks ago.

People like Falwell took it upon themselves to claim AIDS as God's retribution. I can appreciate how hard groups such as the one depicted in the movie worked to call for action. Unfortunately, the next group to be hit hard were drug users, more fodder for the likes of Billy Graham (though he did later retract his statements). Not until straight people started acquiring the virus was any effort put into looking for a cause and working on cure.
Mark Ruffalo displayed a perfect combination of indignant and flawed activist; although, he often slipped into the theatrical. On the other hand, who knew Matt Bomer is more than just a pretty face?

6434223,1,B00KMULA6Q,"History, bio pics, diversity, culture - all these things are really interesting to me and I wanted so bad to see this story through, but I couldn't. While the subject matter has a lot of value and no matter where you stand on issues of homosexuality or AIDS issues there is a lot of value in simply getting more information - no matter how Hollywood may have filtered it - I don't know if the movie is a fair depiction of the story or not.

I watched this movie with my sister and was initially kinda shocked by the gratuitous sex and nudity, but since that was all guys and we're girls and there were all these gorgeous men with drool worthy bodies, we thought we could probably survive it ; )

We were wrong.

While I never got to find out what the man, Mark Ruffalo portrayed, achieved, I feel that there was a lot more importance on making the movie look and feel like a gay porn than on actually telling a story... This was also the worst acting I'd ever seen Ruffalo do and, basically, no one else even seemed interested in trying to be sincere/believable - with the exception of Julia Robert's character (ironically, probably the BEST acting I've ever seen her do.

At the point where we decided we couldn't watch it anymore, I was feeling really cheated. I was on board for the story and it had to play second fiddle to as much sex as the film makers could cram in.

I feel like this film may have really limited its viewers by alienating people who were interested in the story (like myself) but not interested in...well, watching something like pornography... when that's not what I hoped I'd be getting. And it DEFINATELY would alienate people who are uncomfortable with homosexuality, but interested in human rights issues, because they are not going to make it through the first five minutes...",1463270400,,1807,4.513761467889908

6434255,5,B00KMULA6Q,"This riveting movie details the inception of HIV/AIDS in New York City in 1981 and occasionally touches upon the spread of AIDS throughout the country and the globe. It's a real shocker to look back and see how disgracefully the Reagan Administration handled this disease along with the National Institute of Health and the city of New York.

The Normal Heart begins in Fire Island, at the time a haven for gay men, where everybody was young, happy, horny and full of life. It moves on to examine the toll that the disease took on various relationships and how effectively it was a Holocaust for gay men.

What it doesn't do is talk much about IV drug users. I grew up in New Jersey and read The New York Times every day. The main reason that nobody gave a s*** about this illness is that it affected people who were marginalized and considered deviant  gay men and IV drug users or prostitutes. The last two are barely mentioned in the movie, which is unfortunate. The movie also never gave the current stats, which are that about one third of all transmissions in North America are heterosexual and in Africa the number must be more than twice that high.

We have come a long way in terms of funding and treatment (ART) but people with HIV still face a very real stigma; just look at the Internet comments about Charlie Sheen and how he deserved to get sick.

Script was great, acting was terrific with special kudos to Mark Ruffalo for not being uncomfortable playing gay love scenes. Excellent performance by Matt Bomer. Definitely worth seeing twice.",1453075200,,1555,4.619565217391305

I lived during these times but I was on the fringes, where my involvement ended with worrying about which of my gay friends from college would die of this horror and praying for it to stop.  I wasn't aware of the rift in the gay community about closing the bath houses - to me it seemed common sense; but apparently to a community that had been so downtrodden and hidden for so long it seemed like going back into the closet.  I am also shocked by the degree to which our own government ignored the problem for so long that a cluster outbreak turned into a world-wide epidemic, and how trusting we were that the government would never do such a thing.  We now know better and are rightfully skeptical about those in power.  What if it had been Ebola that had shown up on New York's doorstep and was met with such dismissive contempt?  It's hard to fathom.  I could have gotten along without the sex scenes.  I don't like sex scenes in any movies.  As my dad used to say, I don't consider sex to be a spectator sport.  In spite of this I would recommend this movie without reserve to anyone who wants some pretty good information  about the advent of HIV/AIDS and the ensuing fight to control it.

It takes a look at the nation's sexual politics wherein LGBT community aren't respected and the actions taken by the gay activists in exposing the truth behind the disease which at that time was classified as simply gay-related and the non-action taken by the government as well as the nation's attitude of denial towards it.

This is an excellent film as the viewer takes a look on what really happened during that time in history. Also,we get to see the romance between gay couple Ned Weeks and Felix Turner and how the former fought for the truth regarding AIDS and how the latter journeyed towards death because of it.

But if you are open minded and are looking to the true message of this film and what it has to convey to the viewer, it is heartbreaking film of how a nation turned its back on those who needed us most in their darkest of days.  May we never be in that situation again because of race, creed, color, age, sexual orientation, religion, or any other bias when lives are at stake.
Tremendous performance by Mark Ruffalo - what a dramatic stand and daring role.

While no doubt showing the writer's bias (as I believe the story is somewhat autobiographical) it still shows what the United States was like regarding the response to the ""Gay epidemic"". No one who watches this film should be able to do so without a feeling of shame for our country's behavior. Mark Ruffalo and Matt Bomer are both extremely powerful and believable in their roles, and if one isn't crying by the end of this movie, one has no heart. Warning: the movie is very graphic regading gay lifestyle (at that time and in that place) and gay sexual behavior, so it is not a movie for children, unless they have grown up experiencing loss from this horrible epidemic.",1430956800,,836,4.732876712328767

Julia Roberts is quite wonderful, as is Mark Ruffalo, apart from affecting a slightly swishy walk which I felt was totally unnecessary. The entire cast is great, and Joe Mantello, in particular, has a scene which reminds you of the power of great acting. Having lived through this nightmarish period in history, it does push old buttons, and at times the tears flowed. The scene with the choir singing The Man I Love, is an inspired, deeply moving moment. There's so much material here and so many stories worth telling, it could easily have been longer. But everyone should see this. Some of the overly explicit sexual images in the early stages of the film will put some viewers off, but overall, I can't recommend it highly enough.",1422403200,,897,4.6835443037974684

Jim Parson's face on the cover caught my interest...yes, I admit to being just another Shelton Cooper fan.  You know, he is quite good in this too.  I wasn't prepared for a no make-up, but real actress Julia Roberts at all.  Had no idea who Mark Ruffalo was w/my tendency to dwell in the past as far a films go.

As a gay man this is a personal loss of one of our family members.  As we have been rejected by society we have to learn our friends and associates are our family.  A loss is felt by all.

There is a lot of nudity and fairly graphic sex. If the director was trying to get the sympathy of straights he might have slacked off on that a bit. Including so much of it preaches to the choir but at the same time might alienate straights who are easily turned off by it. Is it a life style thing with some? Sure.

6434515,5,B00KMULA6Q,"The movie was very informative and touching.  The acting was superb.

Even though I am a physician who trained in Harlem, New York and at UCLA/Olive View and at Cedar's during the height of the AIDS epidemic, I saw plenty of AIDS patients then. I was not aware the struggles taking place outside of academic facilities or the impact AIDS had on the non-indigent population.

I worked in an affluent community.  In 10 years, I treated only 3 cases of AIDS. I had forgotten what a devastating disease AIDS is.  ""The Normal Heart"" is an important work.

I wish that the relationship between Ruffalo and Bomer would have been developed more fully.  There are some scenes with Ruffalo and Bomer in the beginning and in the middle, then all of a sudden we seen Bomer with end stage AIDS. How did Bomer cope with the knowledge that he had AIDS and would inevitably die?  How did he handle the fear he must have had as he watched his beautiful body disintegrate and his capacity to function grind to a stand still?

Thankfully, there are many more medications to tread the HIV.",1418860800,,1069,4.554973821989528

Just knowing that the effort and dedication that were shown by a few back in the beginning have led to being able to be HIV positive and ""live with AIDS"" for so many now, makes this an important and worthwhile story - especially for the Gay community.  I lived in NYC from 1977-1983, met and became acquainted with Larry Kramer while I was at the Guggenheim Foundation. After I moved away, I learned from friends still living in New York of the passing from AIDS of many that I knew during the years I lived and worked there. The '80's were a much more tragic decade for many in the Gay community than has been documented in the mainstream up to now.  This movie will help alot to overcome the losses, and the pain that still lingers for those who were personally touched by this terrible disease.

6434573,4,B00KMULA6Q,"I found Ryan Murphy's production rather difficult to watch. The action unfolds in a series of circular movements, with the newly- formed GMHC (Gay Men's Health Clinic) trying to obtain funds from central or local government to combat the rapidly-spreading AIDS crisis, yet being continually frustrated in their efforts. Spearheaded by activist Ned Weeks (Mark Ruffalo), the group try every possible means to advance their cause, including television appearances, leaflet distribution, and installing a telephone hot-line.

As they continue their work, so many of their closest friends become infected with the disease and pass away. Sometimes the pain of loss is quite unbearable: when Ned loses his boyfriend Felix Turner (Matt Bomer) in a hospital ward, he embraces Felix in a passionate embrace, while committed doctor Dr. Emma Brookner (Julia Roberts) affirms their wedding vows. In the background, we see Ned's lawyer brother Ben (Alfred Molina) vainly trying not to burst into tears.

The activists' campaign to obtain recognition becomes increasingly fractious as the film unfolds: many of the members resent Ned's increasingly strident public persona, and eventually they decide to cast him out. Such a decision is not universally acknowledged: Tommy Boatwright (Jim Parsons) tearfully embraces Ned in a gesture of enduring friendship.

What THE NORMAL HEART shows is the way in which the public campaign affects all the activists' live: it sows divisions among them where none existed before; it causes resentment as well as disillusion; and nothing ever seems to get done. In one telling scene Ned meets a White House staffer, whose sole aim seems to be to find out whether AIDS affects the heterosexual as well as the homosexual community. If not, then the staffer can feel relieved that his extra-marital affair with a whore will not be brought into public view.

The tone of Murphy's production becomes more intense as the action unfolds. There are at least two dramatic set-pieces, where first Ned and then his colleague Mickey Marcus (Joe Mantello) allow their emotions to get the better of them and start ranting against the government, their friends, and their basic helplessness in trying to continue their campaign. Their friends can do little else but try to console them. Both sequences might seem slightly hysterical in tone, but we have to bear in mind the emotional and physical strain experienced by all the protagonists. This is the only way they have to let off steam.

THE NORMAL HEART is an angry movie; based on a Broadway hit first performed over thirty years ago, it suggest that comparatively little has been done to combat the AIDS virus since it was brought to public attention. A series of sonorous title-cards at the end remind us of just how many victims there have been worldwide of the disease. Perhaps we need to have more dedicated doctors like Emma Brookner to continue research into the disease - if governments will permit them to do so. In a world dedicated to capitalism and money- making, this seems increasingly unlikely.",1413676800,6,3070,5.132

We sadly put Japanese in internment camps, spit on German citizens during the insanity that we had to fight against and through (World War Two, )treated Chinese as less while they built our highways and roads, look down upon immigrants from many other countries who mow are lawns,clean our homes, cook fast food in restaurants sprawling across the environment as well as in the acclaimed edifices that serve meals costing as much(  if not more) than wages earned. We even turned away those of Jewish faith from our shores to face death in the camps of deadly gas ,starvation, torture, and flames.
  Yes, we are an amazing country , have great compassion , created wondrous works of literature and art, science and engineering ,medicine, humanitarian deeds. Most amazing is we have learned (many we can say) from our mistakes , prejudice, ignorance in many situations .Not to grow and learn may be the most grievous of faults,however.
This filmed version of Larry Kramer 's play is an opportunity to share in a small but very significant time in the LGBT search for humanity and life as well as the understanding of the transformative power of love. The writing, acting, filming, are all remarkable. If you did not live through this time, or ignored it, lift yourself up with the empathetic compassion and understanding it offers. If you did experience it, here is your chance to be proud of those who fought for all that America says it is ,and know you too have been one with all those who have been seen as OTHER  . I am a gay man who has spent 51 years with the love of his life.we have been as faithful and true as a Norman Rockwell illustration would suggest. We have even been married three times to each other on our journey through life both serving the better good of others and with great joy. Want to know why we feel part of the one Human Family?

The Normal Heart isn't my first HIV/AIDS focused movie. I watched and shed several tears during Philadelphia and I sobbed through the end of Dallas Buyers Club, but as potent and meaningful as those two films were, neither hit me half as hard as the TV film adaptation of The Normal Heart. I think this is due in part to the fact that The Normal Heart is written by a man who lived through the very crisis at the heart of the story and that the semi-autobiographical leanings of the screenplay lend a certain gravitas and authenticity to the film. The fact that a gay man, Ryan Murphy, directed The Normal Heart and that the film starred several known gay actors like Matt Bomer and Jim Parsons also added to the reality of what I was seeing. These people aren't just playing at being gay or being affected by the issues highlighted in the film  these men are living in a world directly affected and shaped by the events taking place in the story and that somehow packed a significantly greater punch.

I couldn't watch The Normal Heart in one sitting. It was too much. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding in his role as Ned Weeks (a fictionalized Larry Kramer) and the monologues he delivers in the film whether to his brother, lover, friends or enemies, often had me choked up with ineffable emotion, overwhelmed by the bitter desperation in his pleas for those around him to take note of their plight.

What left me the most destroyed after watching this film was the relationship between Ned and his one true love, Felix Turner  played by the beautiful Matt Bomer. Why does it matter that he's beautiful? Because we see a healthy, young and exquisite man wither and die on screen and that physical transformation in itself was shocking and devastating. (Kudos to Matt Bomer for risking his health to drop 40 pounds for the role). But the physical ramifications of the disease weren't nearly as eviscerating as the emotional journey for these two characters coming from very different backgrounds: Felix has an ex-wife and son who he is not allowed to see, but despite that has still allowed himself to love and form committed relationships with men, while Ned is blatant about his sexuality yet emotionally repressed to the point of denying himself any emotional connection, preferring nameless one-night hook-ups. In the words of Felix:

Men do not naturally not love. They learn not to.

It's only when Ned meets Felix  again  that Ned allows himself to love, which of course results in tragedy when Felix is diagnosed with AIDS. Watching their relationship unfold in a candid portrayal of how the disease physically progresses  seriously, little is left to the imagination  as well as the psychological and emotional affects on these lovers and those around them, didn't just bring me to tears, but actually made me nauseated, as I couldn't help but imagine what it would be like to watch one of my loved ones disappear in front of me without being able to do anything about it.

Doomed love story aside, this film is about the triumph of the human spirit and the determination, preservation and dedication of people like Ned Weeks who eventually helped make the HIV/AIDS crisis a top national priority, resulting in better education and medical care for all sufferers of the disease, gender and sexuality aside.

If I have any criticisms of this film it's that I could've done with a bit less politicking and a lot more emphasis on the development of Ned and Felix's relationship. I know that wasn't the point or focus of the story, but things seemed to progress quickly and largely off-screen when I really wanted to see their love grow and witness more of how it affected these characters in the midst of the health crisis.

Suffice it to say, I am so glad this play was made into a film otherwise I might never have known it existed. As hard as this film is to watch, I strongly recommend it. There is nothing glamorous about The Normal Heart, but it is extremely brave and honest, which is why I will be taking shares out in Kleenex and rewatching this film again and again.",1412467200,2,4116,4.698611111111111

6434600,5,B00KMULA6Q,"A beautifully updated film version of the '85 play only goes to show that once something is groundbreaking it remains so, years later, especially when the subject of the piece is culturally altering and presently valid and important to address.  Larry Kramer, a master author, a title easily justified if only two of his works, the script of WOMEN IN LOVE and the iconoclastic FAGGOTS are used as a measure.  To be brief, he has written a basic warning scream into the face of the sleeping millions to make them and the world aware of the horrific disease that has suddenly appeared.  Much as the many in Germany who saw what was about to or was already happening and tried to warn others and were met with passivity and disbelief, the frustration experienced by the leading character (based on Mr. Kramer) and soon transferring itself to the viewers of the piece itself only adds validity to this piece of ""docudrama"".

Mark Ruffalo once again proves himself to be an actor who has a talent that is to be respected and watched carefully.  Over the past few years he has honed his talent so that every move, every moment in this piece is carefully presented as a moment of reality that at times is painful to watch.

There is humor in the script (as there is in life, or watch out for your psyche), there is romance, there is heartbreak, there is humanity, but above all, there is a story of who each of us can be, in some way, be responsible for the state of our world and have a responsibility to each other that is too often in today's society, ignored.

The scenes are distilled down to their essences, so all we see are the most intense events rather than a glimpse into the everyday lives of everyday (but special) characters.

6434645,5,B00KMULA6Q,"The Normal Heart is based on Larry Kramer's 1985 play by the same name. Kramer also wrote the screenplay (he was a screenwriter before he was an activist, and he got an Oscar nomination for adapting D H Lawrence's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Women-in-Love/dp/B00007KQA1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Women in Love</a>&nbsp;for Ken Russell in 1969); Ryan Murphy directed; and Mark Ruffalo, Matt Bomer, Julia Roberts, Alfred Molina and others star.

It's essentially an autobiographical account of Kramer's experiences as a vocal and belligerent activist at the beginning of the AIDS crisis in New York in the early 1980s. I never saw the play, and the movie adaptation is so cinematic that, if I hadn't known, I never would gave guessed it was originally written for the stage. It doesn't seem at all like a filmed play, as so many do.

It is a very beautifully written and acted movie. I expected a tiresome polemic about AIDS, and I was surprised and delighted to find much more.

It IS an issue movie, with AIDS as the issue, and it's also a document of what life was like for some gay men in early-80s New York. But, much more importantly to me, it's a very entertaining and moving story about a brilliant and fiery and difficult man on a mission he couldn't have shirked even if he'd wanted to.

It's about family, in all senses. It's about love when love isn't easy. It's deeply romantic and it's heart-rending but never maudlin. It's about injustice and survival and life and death and joy.

It's about very real people - and I don't just mean individual people who really did (and do) exist. It's about being a human being in a difficult world, so it's profoundly relevant to everybody, not just gay men. I loved it.

I'm in awe of Mark Ruffalo now. I'd come to think of him as a quirky but predictable actor who pretty much just played himself in every movie he made, but he blew all that crap away with his performance in this movie. He's amazing.

So are Matt Bomer and Julia Roberts, and even beautiful Taylor Kitsch is pretty good.  Paul Simon's haunting ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" is absolutely perfect at the end.",1409702400,5,2178,4.8517520215633425

6434648,3,B00KMULA6Q,"The play was great.  No question about it.  But the film version is a bit disappointing.  The story deserved to be told in a straight-forward way because the narrative itself contains enough drama and tension.  But the director chose to employ a lot of distracting dutch angles, high overhead shots that served no purpose, and slo-mo effects.  The film is very ""camera-conscious"" -- the camera work gets in the way of the viewer's attempt to get lost in the story.

And the editing has rhythm issues -- there's a definite, steady, regular tempo to the cuts and lengths of scenes.  It's too quick and it's distracting.  Director Ryan Murphy's background in primarily in episodic TV, and he (in my opinion) fails to find the correct flow for this movie.

There have been other HBO telefilms about the AIDS crisis, and notable among them is ""And The Band Played On"" from almost 20 years ago.  That film dealt with many of the same topics and issues as ""The Normal Heart"" but it was a better-made film.

The cast in ""The Normal Heart"" is certainly good, although Julia Roberts seems the odd exception.  I've seen her give good performances and I'm sure she could nailed this one too.  But either because of the directing or the editing or both (and some questionable camera placement in one scene that makes her look silly) her performance suffers.

This is not the first movie or play about the AIDS crisis.  But some films prior to ""The Normal Heart"" had the benefit of better timing and better directing.

I'd recommend ""And The Band Played On"" or ""Angels in America"" instead of this film version of ""The Normal Heart.""",1409702400,8,1618,4.684397163120567

6434663,5,B00KMULA6Q,"Watched this on my local HBO outlet a few weeks ago and was blown away by its brilliance.  A powerful, totally absorbing drama and a long overdue television production of Larry Kramer's ground breaking  AIDS play.  Perhaps we should be grateful it has taken this long to be made into a movie because this important piece of history may not have been handled with the deserved significance that this current production has achieved.
A quality film with impeccable direction by Ryan Murphy from Kramer's poignant teleplay and peerless acting by Mark Ruffalo, Matt Bomer, Joe Mantello, Julia Roberts, Jim Parsons and Alfred Molina although every participant is first rate. Everything about ""The Normal Heart"" suggests commitment and class from all concerned. Obviously this was not made for the sake of filling  a couple of hours of programming. Surprised it did not win more Emmy awards but more importantly, it did achieve its main aim by winning our hearts and minds.",1409097600,5,967,5.025
6434664,5,B00KMULA6Q,TNH takes us back to the beginning of the plague so that we will not forget... it is a beautiful film with heartrending performances from Mark Ruffalo and Matt Bomer.,1409011200,4,166,4.566666666666666
6434665,5,B00KMULA6Q,Loved it!,1409011200,2,9,4.0
6434666,5,B00KMULA6Q,Get ready for a range of emotions - especially if you lived through that period of time. I'm still beyond belief that it didn't rack up more awards at The Emmy's last night. The movie was monumental but it couldn't achieve that status without the fine acting that went into it. Matt Bomer in particular - call 911 because he was robbed!!!  Larry Kramer rocks!!! Long after he is gone his spirit & activism will live on.,1409011200,5,419,4.441558441558442
6434667,5,B00KMULA6Q,SHED A TEAR AND SEE THE GREAT ACTING DONE BY ALL THESE MEN AND WOMEN. OF COURSE JULIE ROBERTS WAS GREAT AND EVERY ONE ELSE  DID JUST AS GOOD WOW BLEW ME AWAY,1409011200,6,157,3.757575757575758

6434669,3,B00KMULA6Q,"I would say, watch ""We Were Here"" instead.  Real emotions, real people. This is Hollywood and although I'm sure the intentions are good, some overacting and clich scenes and I'm just not a fan of Julia Roberts.",1408924800,8,210,4.675675675675675

6434673,5,B00KMULA6Q,"The acting ensemble is incredible!! Ruffalo and Bomer deserve every accolade.  R. Murphy has done Kramer's work justice.  This is no stereotypical puff piece like ""Behind the Candlelabra,"" ""Normal Heart"" is realistic, gritty, and infuriating.  This film is the finest piece of work I have seen in any genre, in a long, long time!!  Thank You Murphy et. al.!!!!  Watched it four times in two days!  Cried every time!",1408752000,7,415,4.942028985507246
6434674,5,B00KMULA6Q,"Excellent.  Interesting as an historical account of the onset of the AIDS epidemic, and as a human drama.  Mark Ruffalo is wonderful.  Julia Roberts is also a stand-out.",1408665600,2,169,4.964285714285714
6434675,5,B00KMULA6Q,"What a beautiful movie!  I was in University during the early 80's and remember the fear; the discrimination; the sadness and the incredible sense of loss as my friends died.  Larry Kramer's play, and this adaptation, do a wonderful job of bringing that time back to life and I think it should be shown in schools to make sure we never forget!",1408492800,4,343,4.516129032258065
6434676,5,B00KMULA6Q,"This is an excellent movie. It portrays what transpired during the initial crisis of HIV/AIDS. It demonstrated the stigma that homosexual men faced during the initial development of this disease.  It is sad that many physicians did not even want to treat these individuals. Even the government did not assist during this epidemic. So many young men lost their lives to this virus. This movie actually made me cry, which is very hard to do. It is definitely a must see. Julia Roberts did an excellent job in this movie in her devotion to helping her patients. I hope that many individuals realize what homosexual men faced during this initial crisis by watching this movie!.",1408233600,5,673,4.852173913043479
6434677,5,B00KMULA6Q,"I have been wanting to see this movie ever since its premier. So sad, so tragic and yet due to the politics and ignorance, it didn't have to be that way. I grew up with the AIDS epidemic and yet, as a health care worker, I am still amazed at the number of people who are infected daily. While there may be medications to keep people ""healthy"", the virus is still there and will continue to spread. Of the newly diagnosed cases, don't people realize that they will forever be dependent on the medications to keep them alive to live a somewhat ""normal"" life. And yet, (and I am not singling out the gay community), some continue to live recklessly, creating new strains of HIV and so many more STDs. These types of diseases become immune to the drugs that are currently out there. Please...wake up and realize each individual has to do their part in eradicating these highly infectious diseases. Let's not forget what we have learned from this film! Everyone in this movie deserve recognition for their roles and the story told. Larry Kramer has played such a pivotal role in bringing HIV/AIDS to public awareness...keep his momentum alive!",1408147200,4,1138,4.666666666666667
6434678,5,B00KMULA6Q,"Somebody better get an award for this, if not everybody.",1408147200,3,56,4.7
6434679,5,B00KMULA6Q,"One of these days, I will make it through this movie without crying...maybe. This is a movie about when the AIDS crisis hit America and how we (as a nation) basically did nothing about it until it was too late. This movie is all about the dearly departed friends, lovers, and family members that were taken from us at that time. It shows a realistic depiction of AIDS symptoms, so this is not for the faint of heart! Still, awareness is important so I highly recommend this movie! I also recommend everyone out there know their status and protect themselves....",1407628800,7,561,4.62
6434680,5,B00KMULA6Q,"""We have to do something. No one else will."" In the early 1980's a new disease that came to be known as HIV/AIDS came about and was affecting the gay community. Since it was only affecting that community nothing was being done to help find a cure or even talk about it. One brave doctor Emma Brookner (Roberts) was trying to help who she could but without support it was tough. When Ned Weeks (Ruffalo) a gay man with a loud voice takes the lead he has mixed results. First thing I have to say is that this is a tough movie to watch. The movie is fantastic and the acting is amazing but it's not really a feel good type movie that helps you relax and wind down. By default the easiest way to talk about this movie is to compare it to the Dallas Buyers Club. Both are very good but while McConaughey was great in the movie it seemed to lack any real emotion (to me at least). This one is so emotional and powerful that you end up getting mad and outraged at both the government, the ignorance of certain people and even Weeks and his crew. There are certain movies that words can't do justice to and just need to be seen. This is one of them. Overall, nothing I can say about this movie will be as good or powerful as experiencing it yourself. Just watch this. I give it an A.",1406419200,32,1275,4.145161290322581
6434681,5,B00KMULA6Q,"When I sat down to watch The Normal Heart, I had no idea just how much I was about to be moved, amazed, traumatized, enraged, heartbroken, and enlightened. I've been passionate about gay rights and issues ever since I knew what it was to be gay, and I had not one clue how horrible the AIDS epidemic was at its inception. The Normal Heart is an unflinching look at a horrific time in our history where human beings were treated by the masses as garbage. Literally. And that's when they were even being acknowledged at all. Every actor involved gave an Oscar-worthy performance, ironically in a movie that is not eligible for the award. Mark Ruffalo's passion jumps right out of the screen at you, and in both its most angry and its most devastating, you're right there with him. Julia Roberts gives an Erin Brockovich-like performance times ten. Jim Parsons is wonderful in the first role most of us are seeing him outside of Sheldon Cooper, both with his moments of humor and more importantly with his heart. Many kudos also to Taylor Kitsch, Joe Mantello, Alfred Molina, Finn Wittrock, and of course Ryan Murphy for his fearless and beautiful direction. But Matt Bomer... Matt Bomer is THE star among stars, pulling at every single one of your heartstrings in one of the bravest roles ever committed to film. This is without a doubt one of the most important movies you will ever see.",1406419200,71,1386,4.661224489795918
