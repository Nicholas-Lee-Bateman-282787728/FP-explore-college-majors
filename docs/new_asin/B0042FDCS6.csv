Anyone who is a huge vampire this is a must have about vampires and what's awesome about this series it was flimed Romania and I have this soundtrack to the first flim of this movie also the Vampire Journals aren't bad either!",1392163200,,344,4.134328358208955
4250404,5,B0042FDCS6,"I first watched the ""Subspecies"" trilogy with my mom when I was around eleven years old (being horror enthusiasts together was our thing). I remembered loving the hell out of these movies as a little girl, and when I saw the DVD set, I just had to have them. I'm pleased to say that, after all these years, they still hold up!

Some of the effects are a little cheesy now, but the make-up is truly amazing, especially on Radu's mother, Circe, in II and III. The stories are still pretty enjoyable, and I still like the characters. I had a great time watching these with my own daughter, who is about the age now that I was when I first saw these.

I'm not much of a videophile, but the transfer to DVD (naturally, I originally saw these on VHS) came out pretty good for my money, and the picture is just lovely. Recommended for fans of vampires and low-budget horror.",1391126400,2,867,4.345679012345679

4250411,4,B0042FDCS6,This is one of my long time Vampire movie series by FULL MOON Studios. I finally broke down and bought this off Amazon after searching for it in a dozen different Wal-Marts and other stores with no luck. I have only one major gripe. This 3 movie collection does NOT HAVE closed captions. Being Hearing impaired I use captions more than most folks. But that is my only complaint. I have these on VHS and I found my DVD copies to be of better quality than the VHS. From what I understand of other reviews that is not the case with all of the DVD versions. This series is alot better than most of the other crap out there. Granted it is B Movie material on a low budget. Vampires are supernatural predators not kissy sparkly creatures. If you want KISSY SPARKLY. This isn't for you. It isn't 30 Days of night either. The main character is a Vampire named Michelle who is struggling with being a vampire and losing her humanity. Radu who is the main vampire is teaching MICHELLE to use her powers and trying to get her to give up whats left of her humanity. This is closer to Traditional Vampire than most. Give it a shot and you may be surprised.,1330300800,8,1143,4.32093023255814
4250412,3,B0042FDCS6,"Ah, vampire B-movie schlock. Not big blockbusters starring Anne Rice vamps or Stephenie Meyer sparklepires, but lower-budget affairs splattered with blood.

One of the best examples of the genre is ""Subspecies,"" a movie series with a genuinely creepy villain and lots of atmosphere. ""Subspecies: The Awakening / Bloodstone: Subspecies II / Bloodlust: Subspecies III"" brings together the first three volumes of the series, following the vampire Radu's pursuit of a pretty but utterly useless American girl.

""Subspecies: The Awakening"" (I don't know why it's called that instead of just ""Subspecies"") involves three grad students writing their theses in a Romanian village. Their investigations bring them to a ruined castle where vampires were once said to dwell, as well as an encounter with the broodingly handsome Stefan (Michael Watson). Guess what Stefan is!

But it turns out there is still vampiric stuff afoot: the evil, ghoulish Radu (Anders Hove) has returned to the castle, and has murdered his own dad to steal the Bloodstone (which supposedly drips the blood of saints). And he's decided to make all three girls his consorts -- meaning that only Stefan and an elderly Romanian man can save the day!

In ""Subspecies II: Bloodstone,"" Radu is returned to life and immediately kills his brother, only for Michelle (Denise Duff) to immediately escape with the Bloodstone. Her sister Becky (Melanie Shatner) arrives in Romania to try to help her sister, but she has little idea that Michelle has become one of the undead -- and that Radu is determined to find her.

And in ""Subspecies III: Bloodlust,"" Radu's ""mummy"" returns him to live with Michelle's blood. The three of them immediately teleport back to the Transylvanian castle, where Radu begins educating Michelle in the ways of the vampire -- and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Becky arranges a small-scale infiltration of Radu's castle, so she can rescue her sister.

""Subspecies"" is a pretty cheesy piece of work -- lots of naked boobs, goopy blood and hilarious death scenes (head-stab!) permeate the series. And the main character  is a vampire who looks like a ghoul and has fingers he can snap off to form little stop-motion demons that... well, they occasionally fetch things for him. Like I said, cheesy.

However, it's a fun kind of cheesy. It's the kind of cheesy that you want to get popcorn for, rather than scoffing at -- and it's definitely more hardcore than ""Twilight."" Some parts (the middles of ""Bloodstone"" and ""Bloodlust"") are rather slow-moving, but we also get charming Romanian villages, picturesquely decayed castles and plenty of vampire attacks.

The characters, however, are a mixed bag. Anders Hove is a deliciously disgusting villain, with his stringy fingers, ghoulish face and drooling mouth. But he also manages to inject some pathos into Radu in ""Bloodlust,"" where we see the vampire starting to grow sad. And Becky Shatner does a really good as a strong, independent heroine who just wants to rescue her sister.

Sadly, Denise Duff's Michelle does little other than cry, scamper around whining, and hang around Bucharest clubs in increasing gothic clothing. You'll get tired of her fast; the character is much better when played by Laura Tate. Stefan is possibly the wimpiest vampire in existence (he's immobilized by a NET), and ""Mummy"" may actually be a mummy that someone dug up and put on puppet strings.

""Subspecies: The Awakening / Bloodstone: Subspecies II / Bloodlust: Subspecies III"" brings together the first three -- and three best -- Subspecies movies. Watch these, and avoid the fourth one.",1329523200,,3606,5.115646258503402
8413601,5,B0042FDCS6,"The movies rock!
I have loved this series since it first came out and had it on VHS, which wore out a long time ago. So happy to find them on DVD.
Not cheesy at all,  but well done and if you like cult classics, vamps, and movies done before all the cgi stuff,  these are for you.
The plot is original and keeps your interest, acting is very good, in my opinion.

The DVD itself  is great quality, it plays perfectly, the picture isn't fuzzy, came with no scratches, and was actually sealed along the top. This isn't a pirate copy from Mexico like so many are that are sold here.",1494288000,,579,4.142857142857143
