8611156,3,B002HWXSUS,"I already had the VHS English edition of the movie. The only reason why I wanted to purchase the dvd was to get the English audio, but mostly the English subtitles for my 10-year-old son to understand the dialogs better (we are French Canadians). So for me it's wasted money. If I had bought this item in a regular store, I would have returned it for refund, but in this case, I wouldn't know how to get my money back.",1302825600,,418,4.2375
