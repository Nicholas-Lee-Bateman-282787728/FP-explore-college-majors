8371850,3,B002KBAYOE,"In one of the two scenarios, a man is mysteriously killed and he left a letter describing a struggle with admitting his sexual orientation.  The work never mentions the term ""rough trade,"" but that is the likely suspect, rather than a bigoted killer.  Historically, police and the gay male community have had beef with each other.  Read about the events after the murder of Harvey Milk as an example.  However, here a local gay group works with the cops to find the murder.  They even give them an award for their efforts.  If you look carefully, though, all the gay activists interviewed are Latino.  They mention the term ""de ambiente,"" a term specific to Latino, gay subculture (kinda like ""Two Spirit"" for Native American gays).  An award presentation occurs that has the glitz of a GLAAD event, but mostly with Latino performers and presenters.  For decades, coverage of gays in the media has been criticized for not sufficiently including people of color.  This is not the case here.  Sadly, these cop programs that cover violence and murder are often far more likely to show LGBTs of color than in other media productions.  I think this episode will be valuable for many viewers to see and experience.",1389312000,,1208,4.810679611650485
