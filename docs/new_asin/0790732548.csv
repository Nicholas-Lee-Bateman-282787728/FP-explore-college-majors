88082,5,0790732548,"I am impressed first and foremost by the casting.  I would have never guessed that a Wayans and Segal would work well together, but they really do.  The compliment each others abilities quite well.  With that in mind I should say that this really isn't your average run-of-the-mill police movie.  We all know that Segal has been in a bunch of those.  There is still plenty of action, and a lot of humerous scenes, so I don't think you will be dissapointed.  I wasn't.",1044489600,3,467,4.5
88083,5,0790732548,"""The Glimmer Man"" is about a Buddhist police officer played by Steven Seagal. That's the whole movie. He teams up with Keenen Ivory Wayans and they try to look for 'The Family Man,' a serial killer who uses religion to make his mark. Steven Seagal was about to be killed by a Russian gang, but he told them, ""I gotta lot of cash OR you can take plastic."" He used his credit card as a weapon, how nifty is that? Another encounter involved Seagal walking into a restaurant and he caused lots of damage. All of that wine gone to waste and Seagal managed to try some of the food! He sure does enjoy food! Then Seagal fought a bald martial artist at the end of the movie and asked, ""Is that the best you got!?"" Yes, Steven Seagal can bring it and eat it in this movie. The duo found the killer and uncovered a deep plot involving smuggling. This movie is comedy, especially when Seagal gave Wayans a taste of powdered deer privates. It was disgusting, yet satisfyingly original! Good movie.",1023408000,5,985,4.387978142076503
88084,5,0790732548,I like to credit this as one of Stevens best movies. Because of its action scenes well written story plot with slight comedy and great actors. This is one of my favorite Steven Seagal movies. I enjoyed this movie very much. If you haven't seen this awesome film yet go see it I recommend it highly.,1011571200,8,298,4.339285714285714
88085,3,0790732548,"I regard this movie as the beginning of the first downward spiral of Seagal's career. After the epic action of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege-2-Dark-Territory-Blu-ray/dp/B001CT877G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege 2: Dark Territory [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Executive-Decision/dp/0790731894/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Executive Decision</a>&nbsp;it was a bad mistake to sign-up for The Glimmer Man. When I went to the cinema to see this film on November 2nd 1996 they didn't even tear my ticket stub. Of the thousands of cinema tickets I've kept it's the only one that hasn't been torn. Not even the employees of the long-gone ABC Cinema could be bothered keeping tabs on the audience. Needless to say that the film wasn't screened for critics and every review in the papers that week was nothing but waffling on presumptions of what a typical Seagal film would be. I am making up for that now with a proper review.

The fundamental flaw in The Glimmer Man is that it's just far too contrived. The 80s 'mis-matched cops' clich didn't help either. Plus, the film was yet another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Blu-ray-Book/dp/B001BPQT8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven [Blu-ray Book</a>] wannabe, a sub-genre that flooded cinemas post October 1995.

Seagal plays Jack Cole, a weirdo New York cop transferred to Los Angeles for reasons that are never clearly defined. He's teamed-up with wisecracking Detective Jim Campbell (Keenan Ivory Wayans, who did not like Seagal) to catch 'The Family Man'; a serial killer who crucifies families (actually just the parents). But things get a little too personal for Cole when his ex-wife is killed by a Family Man copycat because she was the psychiatrist of the high school kid he saved who had discovered his evil step-dad's plan to sell chemical weapons sold by the Russian Mafia and brokered by the CIA, who Cole used to work for.

It's very poorly written by Kevin Brodbin, himself a former film critic, so he ought to have known better. This wouldn't be so bad if the fight scenes were remotely impressive. There are a couple of good action moments, like Campbell's apartment fight, but the rest are very quickly edited to compensate for Seagal's decreasing suppleness and rapidly expanding waistline. And after the high adventure of his previous movies, going back to low-wattage bar fights and gun play just isn't exciting.

Unknown director John Gray (who?) shoots the film like a TV movie. You'd be forgiven for thinking that this was an average episode of CSI:New York. He tries to mimic the retro-noir look of Se7en with lots of gloomy locations and rain but it just gives the film a really oppressive feel.

It's obvious that Seagal's influence on the script made it to the screen. As usual there's mumbo-jumbo about Cole's mysterious past (something Seagal both pretends AND denies he has). The mystical Buddhist stuff really adds nothing, you can see right through it to Seagal's unnecessary pandering, and what exactly is the deal with those jackets? Definitely from Seagal's own wardrobe and strategically chosen to conceal the Belly the of the Beast.

There's some decent acting to be had outside of Seagal's non-effort. Wayans proves he's more capable of being an action than the rest of his family (and Seagal too) and Brian Cox (a last-minute replacement for Tommy Lee Jones who probably said 'oh no, not Seagal again' and fled) plays the same old dodgy CIA buffoon he's built half his career on.

If you can get around the uninspired, gibberish title and if you are suffering a serious deficit in better action movies then give it a go. Just don't bother with the horribly censored UK cut, butchered by the BBFC.",1003276800,11,3852,5.4638655462184875
88086,3,0790732548,"This is by far one of the better movies that Seagal has been in, he even shows that he can act a little and there is comedy from Seagal's sidekick Daemon Wayans. This is a stereotypical buddy / action movie, with lots of explosions, fight scenes and 8 people going through windows. Even though it is a buddy movie, all of the time is spent on Seagal's character who is the Glimmer man, a detective who is a former killer who found peace and spirituality. If it sounds corny, it is the joke of the entire movie but Seagal gets the last laugh as usual beating up bad guys, doing comedy and throwing a few philosophical lines at the audience. Its not a bad movie, and it has a great running time of 92 minutes, because the action does get repetitive, especially the final fight scene, as the same kick is used a good 25 times against Seagal.",999302400,,838,4.310126582278481
88087,3,0790732548,"I had been pleasently surprised watching a Steven Seagal movie once and thought to repeat the experience. I'm quite torn on this movie however. It stars Steven Seagal acting as a cop with a spiritual side, who moves to LA to help in a murder investigation with a new partner cop, Keenen Ivory Wayans.  Seagal starts out stating that he can't fight because it's against his religion. But once he breaks the seal he just goes on killing all the bad guys without a look back. He totally goes against his religious background with out regrets even though they spend time setting up a plot around his break from his violent past.
I think what bothered me about his character is that he seems to have no code of ethics or even of police work. He kills all his suspects, doesn't follow police procedure, has no second thought to the fact that he's working on personal vendetta instead of his job as a cop, and bascially throws away his badge and therefore his vow of protect and serve means nothing. If you're someone who doesn't mind that the good guy is a bad cop and a cold blooded killer than you might just like this movie.
I also found the movie very violent, outside of the normal shoot-em-up, knock-em-down formula. At one point Seagal repeatedly pistol whips a guy into a bloody pulp, and the murder victims the cops investigate are pretty gross too.
The saving grace of this movie was Keenen Ivory Wayans. He was actually very enjoyable and in my mind saved this flick, although at some points the film was shot well.
The plot was thin, with a lot of time spent on focusing on Seagal's character making this movie have two plots, the past of Seagal and the investigation going on. This movie tried to be Rush Hour and failed. You're not sure in the beginning if Seagal is trying to be Asian or Native American, the fight scenes were horribly edited and the plot seemed thrown together to hide a movie about Seagal's (character's) past.
The DVD doesn't have very many features, but since the movie is cinemagraphically shot well it's worth it to own on DVD. It's a must have for any Seagal fan, and worth watching, just not worth getting into deeply or for fighting. It's an action movie that tries too hard to have plot.",993340800,3,2223,4.516129032258065
88088,3,0790732548,"This film could have been much better with just a little bit more work.  The main problem here is Seagal.  He's fat, period.  And it's clear that in some of the action scenes he just can't hack it.  The director--undoubtedly under direction from Seagal himself--has to resort to fast motion, jump-cuts, and telephoto lenses in order to hide the fact that Seagal has placed IHOP Under Siege.  I believe that he was making this film as he was going through a messy divorce and therefore chose to drown his sorrows in milk shakes. But c'mon, all the black coats and hands-over-my-fat-stomach-body-language cannot hide the fact that one of the world's most popular action stars has let himself go.  Thankfully, this movie is nearly 5 years old and it looks as though Seagal is braced for a big comeback with EXIT WOUNDS.  Judging by the preview he has lost some weight and has shed the ponytail as well.  For a glimpse of a man lost in his own Pizza Hut excesses, check out GLIMMER MAN.  Oh, and don't try and follow the plot.  It really doesn't make much sense.",981504000,3,1058,4.579787234042553
88089,5,0790732548,"It is admitted that Steven Seagal, as an actor, is not of the ""method"" school of Brando and De Niro. You don't watch his films to see him act. If you want to see acting, then watch the powerhouses  Humphrey Bogart or Jack Nicholson, but not Seagal, the seventh dan black  belt aikidoist. His films are primarily made to thrill and entertain. With  his erect posture, powerful build and frowning expression, he exerts an  intimidating screen presence. Like a tornado sweeping across the torrid  zone, he leaves the bad guys annihilated and in brief, hard-trimmed action  scenes, he despatches villain after villain with either a bullet to the  head, a chop to the throat, a thrust with a knife or a kick to the face. In  this film at least, he also manages to be mildly humorous and even  self-deprecating in his portrayal of a bead-wearing Buddhist cop. This is  the first film in which he actually draws blood during a conflict with a  bad guy. The action scenes are supreme. The dialogue is post-Tarantino tart  and the film, as a whole, is wonderfully self-mocking.",959472000,17,1068,4.713513513513513
88090,1,0790732548,"Steven Seagal's performance proves to be the only worthwhileaspect of THE GLIMMER MAN.  His soft-spoken, John Wayne style actingcommands attention throughout the film.  Seagal's even funny at times, just as the Duke could be in, for example,THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE and THE SEARCHERS.

Unfortunately, the rest of THE GLIMMER MAN falls flat, as if it were on the receiving end of Steven Seagal's fist.  The worst parts are what ought to be the best parts - the action sequences.  Multiple blows to the head and groin barely affect people.  An explosion throws a man out a second story window and, because he lands in an open convertible, he's OK!  Even in a karate flick, don't you want at least some credibility?

While the video's cover promises wisecracks from GLIMMER MAN co-star Keenan Ivory Wayans, instead THE GLIMMER MAN uses Wayans as little more than a prop for what is an all-Seagal vehicle.

Finally, THE GLIMMER MAN features several homosexual characters as psycho-killers and criminals.  If Hollywood is so liberal, how come they are still perpetuating such a stereotype?

I mentioned that Steven Seagal's sometimes funny in this movie, just as he was in his stand0out UNDER SIEGE films.  I'd like to see him try a real comedy.",946857600,2,1248,4.91866028708134

But if the viewer is in the mood for an action film with a hero that is unbeatable, with double cross and revenge, then this is the film for him. Seagal is given a title like Superman and Batman. He is the Glimmer man. All is quiet, nothing seen anywhere, then a glimmer, Seagal is there and people are dead.
In this film, Seagal once worked for a part of the CIA that handled the hardest assignments. Then he got religion and quite. After a while, he joined the police. He does not want to fight unless he has to. To the delight of viewers, this happens often.
There are lots of fights in the film and lots of people are killed.",1465171200,,670,4.122137404580153

88137,3,0790732548,"Released in 1996, The Glimmer Man is a cop thriller starring Steven Seagal and Keenen Ivory Wayans as a detective team in Los Angeles, the former recently transferring from New York City. As they get to know each other they're simultaneously tracking a serial killer called the family man who kills whole families and crucifies his (or her) victims on the walls. Will they catch the killer and who is it?

This is a competent buddy cop thriller in the mold of the Dirty Harry flicks, the Lethal Weapon films and even Se7en, but with Seagal and Wayans. If you like those films and Seagal or Wayans you might want to check this out. The movies decent with a few quality Seagal fight sequences, but something holds it back from greatness, like the Dirty Harry flicks. The serial killer who crucifies his victims on the walls seriously stretches realism. How exactly does he lift the victims up on the wall to stake their hands into it? Wouldnt that take a lot of extra time after murdering a family? What about the noise? Would a killer seriously stick around to do this? I just didn't like the complexities and contrivances of the serial killer subplot, particularly as it developed in the final act. Moreover, the constantly raining weather of dead-of-Winter Los Angeles makes for a gloomy cinematic palate. However, everything else clicks for a quality cop thriller, except that there are no prominent female roles.

The movie runs 91 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles.

88184,3,0790732548,"Early in his career, Steven Seagal gave us some great (""Out for Justice"", ""Above the Law"", ""Under Siege"") films as well as some good ones (""Hard to Kill"", ""Marked for Death"", ""Dark Territory""), but as his career prospered and his weight grew, the quality of the films started to slip as did their box office appeal. Beginning in 2001, Seagal as a writer and producer made direct to video (DTV) films, usually cranking them out at a rate of 3 per year. Here in 1996 we have one of the last of the classic Seagal films. Indeed it could be argued that it is his last good film, although ""Exit Wounds"" (2001) was pretty good.

""Glimmer Man"" has Seagal as a cop in LA. Keenen Ivory Wayans plays his partner, Brian Cox is his former CIA boss, Bob Gunton plays the villain, and John Murice Jackson is the heavy. The plot is pretty ordinary - Seagal must hunt down a killer which causes he and his partner to come into peril.

Keenen Ivory Wayans is best known for his irreverent Emmy winning TV series ""In Living Color"" (1990-94) although he occasionally appears in film. You'll remember Bob Gunton best from his role as the warden in ""The Shawshank Redepmtion"" (1994). John Murice Jackson is best known for his work as the Rear Admiral on ""JAG"" (1995-2004).

Brian Cox puts in a film stealing performance. Cox won an Emmy for ""Nuremberg"" (2000) and a BAFTA for ""The Escapist"" (2008), but he's probably best known for his work in the first two ""Bourne"" films. Quite frankly I've never seen him give a poor performance, and my favorites are ""Braveheart"" (1995) and ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996).

There is plenty of action and Seagal has the opportunity to display his considerable Aikido skills in full view. The banter between Wayans and Seagal is OK, but not up to the standard of such buddy films as ""The Last Boy Scout"" after which it was patterned. The plot may be a little confusing, due to the cuts made by the producer, but if you stay alert you can follow it if you want. Seagal's pictures don't necessarily need a coherent plot, but it is there if you want it.

Bottom line - one of the last good Steven Seagal films.",1338768000,,2123,4.503896103896104

88189,4,0790732548,"This week's feature has been on Sid's to do list for a very very long time and thanks to On demand at the North Pole North we were able to witness the greatest onscreen chemistry since Brett Q and the adolecesant boys he ""coached"" at a High School in Hicksville, Mississippi. You thought Sid was going with Swayze and McQueen there didn't you? No. They will never be approached. How dare you even think that? So it was with great anticipation that we viewed The Glimmer Man and it did not disapoint.

Seagal plays a former government operative with a checkered past turned New York Buddhist cop. Oh yeah oh yeah. He is teamed up with Keenan Ivory Wayans( he was available?) to take down a sadistic serial killer. This flick was actually made in 1996 but it had a 1991ish look. That's a couple of stars right there. The only thing that was missing out of the Seagal formula in this one was he wasn't his normal studly self. There was no Seagal love interest that would have undoubedly laughed him out of her trailer on set. Oh wait that happened with Nikki Cox anyway.

Sid really can't quantify how good this flick was. There were parts that were ridiculously enjoyable. But the flick got overwhelmed by copious ammounts of football talk and predictions. Dolphins stay really good, the Pack get a lot better, and Brett Favre gets what's coming to him if you're wondering. Ok let's wrap it up with a quick drive-in totals:

1 inexcusable Death Ring ripoff

2 impalings

2 ridiculous window crashings

62 impossible moves by Seagal.

While it's something out of the ordinary for the Buddhist Bonecrusher, this is nevertheless our hero's most narcissistic film prior his DTV outings, and a fairly lazy production in general. The movie is still far removed from Seagal's worst offerings, but when it comes to his theatrical releases, this definitely shouldn't be your choice to introduce yourself or a friend to the aikido master.

The story: eccentric detective Jack Cole (Seagal) is transferred to the West Coast to aid the investigation of a brutal serial killer. Finding a reluctant partner in Lt. Jim Campbell (Keenan Ivory Wayans), the pair must work their way through the killer's web of religious and political motives...before discovering that there may be more than one killer, and more than one reason behind the slayings.

The screenplay panders to Seagal's character ad nauseum: aside from being an unbeatable fighting machine ("" ...like Bruce Lee, even better"") and a philosophy-spouting guru, he regularly outdoes his partner in the humor department. Apparently Keenan Wayans - who's penned totally un-funny material like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Living-Color/dp/B00152M7ZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Living Color</a>&nbsp;and directed laughless films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scary-Movie/dp/B00004Z4WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scary Movie</a>&nbsp;- is comedically-challenged in this movie, becoming Seagal's whipping boy by being tricked into eating animal genitals and routinely being shown up by 'Mister Laughs' Seagal. Forgive me for being upset at my hero, but this is probably him at his self-serving best: his will to dominate Wayans and make a fool of his character nullifies the potential of the buddy-cop premise.

Seagal can't take the blame for all of the film's shortcomings. The acting of co-star Wayans and bad-guys Bob Gunton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patch-Adams/dp/B00000IQV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patch Adams</a>), Brian Cox (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Troy/dp/B002O3Z50Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Troy</a>), and John M. Jackson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JAG/dp/B000F9T70A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JAG</a>) falls into the ""ho-hum"" and ""blah"" categories. The baddies are less threatening than they are portly, old, and slightly gaydar-alerting with how they share drinks and the pool. Also, the fight choreography offers no innovation: it's decent Seagal stuff, sure, but Wayans actually has the best fight of the film if you value back & forth content.

In the film's defense, the showdown in the church is probably the most intense scene Seagal as ever acted in and his shiny wardrobe is interesting to look at. Though dull, the aforementioned fights feature the level of violence we've come to expect from Seagal and are decent enough for spectacle (iron spike through the head, anyone?), and overall, the film has the production values to keep it from looking sloppy. If you've managed to put up with the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Deadly-Ground/dp/0790740826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Deadly Ground</a>, then watching ""Glimmer Man"" shouldn't be tough, but watch it with a hotdog in hand so you've got something to divert your attention to when Steven gets preachy and starts calling people ""white boy.""",1221350400,,3818,6.849794238683128
88192,3,0790732548,The Glimmer Man is Steven Segal's first forary into a buddy movie. Kennan Ivory Wayana gives some good one liners in the film and he even gets beat up a few times.

88193,3,0790732548,"I guess Seagal wanted to be a little like Eastwood here; giving a more forensic approach to his movies, a little twist here and there...and why not a little of Seagal's special recipe of bone crushing formula, it won't due any harm...right?..Wrong, this movie is the perfect example of Segal's downfall from stardom. Since Seagal isn't as thin or as fast as he used to be, he needs a co-star to have a little more screen time so Seagal can catch his breath and eat little more doughnuts. Seriously Seagal hit top bottom after this, with the exception of Fire Down Below and Exit Wounds, all of Segal's future movies following that sucked.

In Glimmer Man Seagal plays Jack Cole, an Ex government intelligence operative known as ""The Glimmer Man,"" because he could move so quickly and quietly that his victims would only see a glimmer before they died. in fact that is so BS, Segal moves slower than his previous movies here, his gut is beginning to grow and his acting is stale and wooden. anyhow back to the movie, Cole is assigned to work with An L.A. police detective named Jim Campbell (Keenen Ivory Wayans) they are both on the look for a serial killer known as the ""Family Man"" he is given that name because...well he kills families; and aside from killing them he tortures and crucifies them after their deaths. After a string of murders the killer gets personal, he kills Coles wife..and you know what that means...that's right...its payback time, but it seems that this killings are beginning to get weird, there is a copycat making the murders look like ""the Family Man""....now the question is Who is the killer, the ""family man or the copycat?

Along with these psychos we have a local crime boss doing dealings with the Russians, somehow its all connected and don't expect a clever twist because there really isn't. I give them credit for adding some suspense here and there, but Segal doesn't belong in this movie, he feels out of place. The only good actors in this movie are Keenen Ivory Wayans and Brian Cox. So yeah, rent it or wait for it to be shown on cable, but don't buy it, not worth it.

Segal plays a detective with a ""mysterious past"" (C'mon Steven, you can only play this character so many times) and he teams up with Wayans to find the ""family man"", a serial killer who targets whole families with a religious twist.

88200,3,0790732548,"Typical Seagal fare, in which thick leather (and even alligator skin) trench coats replace the need for a decent plot. Seagal's paunch is ever present, and his penchant for food is made clear when during one scene he busts in on a private lunch meeting and starts sampling what appear to be enchiladas. At least its good to see Seagal poking fun at his own image, as one villain asks him to take his 'sensitive pony tail and sissy beads' and leave the restaurant. Said villain is met with a swift hand to the throat in response to this statement of course, but you can only ask Seagal to expose his sensitivities so far. One of the more humorous moments include the main villain threatening Seagal in a police station packed with officers, of all places, and Master Steven responding to this by telling the foe to get his 'ugly white a$$' out of the station. This unprecedented outburst of racial indignation is amusing if at all for the fact that Seagal himself is a white man. Just unreal. Look, this is a Seagal film, what do you need to know? He breaks 50 lbs of human bone via various joint locks, he has a pony tail, he is an agent of a state/federal department of some type. Oh yes, and he has a black partner, a situation that seems to be the norm in Seagal films. Prepare to laugh at the absurdity.",1128643200,,1307,4.382716049382716

88202,3,0790732548,"Back in 1996 it seemed like maybe Steven Seagal's career was coming back, but what this ended up being was a last hiccup.  The following 10 years have been direct-to-DVD variations of the same movie he's been in since the beginning.  I can't name one movie that he hasn't been some former jack-of-all-trades for the government.  It's always the same.  The only thing holding this movie together is the villian actors, but even those can only take it so far.  Action-wise, it's typical 90's action fare, but sadly it's typical Seagal as well.  Wayans seems to force act his character.  He does his best, but the same tired story can only be rehashed so many times before it becomes monotonous.

The movie stands on it own as the last big money-making action movie of Seagal's career.  If nothing else it stands as a defining moment in action films---the end of police buddy action movies.  If you like Wayans, The Last Boyscout was way better.  If you like Seagal, it's one of his better films, but really that's not saying much considering they're all the same.",1121472000,,1061,4.681081081081081
88203,3,0790732548,"Just once I want to see Seagal be something other than the macho thug with a mysterious past. Just once. Well it ain't here and that's for darn sure.

Let's see: he's a former CIA hit man of sorts. Golly, what a different role for him! Once again lumbering through scene after scene displaying that nonexitant acting ability, he claims to be nonviolent then pretty much kills everyone he with whom he comes in contact. I gotta admit I did like the credit card trick. I also like Wayans in this film. The fact he allowed someone to actually share screen space might be a harbinger of something good, who knows. I wonder if Seagal actually ever sees these movies. Wayans who never claims to be anything but what he is, gracefully glides from scene to scene while our Akido expert comes around corners like a charging bull elephant (and dam' near as big). Is it just me or does everyone get the impression Seagal is so aware of the camera that it affects even the way he walks?  Is it possible he walks like that in real life? If you know please give me a shout. I digress. Anyway, as for the teaming of these two, maybe if he would do this a little more often his currect stuff wouldn't be heading straight to video.

As noted in earlier reviews, he needs to get a ""glimmer"" of understanding of what we expect in our macho heros. Steve, darlin', work out. The black outfits stopped hiding the belly about 70 pounds ago. You have absolutely no muscle definition, even in the arms. You have the money -- hire a trainer. Get in shape. And here's a flash: go to acting classes. Yeah, yeah I know, ""I can't go to acting class, I'm a star!""  Dare to be different. Learn your craft, lose the weight, get in shape, and make the kind of movies we who have been watching you for the last decade or so know you can.

As for this little flick, the bad guys are exceptionally good, and fine actors all. Kudos for the casting director. The plot is very thin and we have the obligatory fight every few minutes, but thats what a Seagal film is all about. For all my criticism of Mr. Seagal THIS is what he does for a living and if there was no fighting, what would be the point of watching it? Keep in mind, kiddies, at one time he was a martial arts icon.  In this movie you can still get a glimpse of that remarkable talent.

This is not one of the dregs he has been releasing of late. In fact, this is at least watchable and occasionally enjoyable. As in all his stuff (especially in the last few years) don't expect too much. With Wayans here, you might actually have fun with this one.",1120176000,,2572,4.290721649484536
88204,4,0790732548,"Once a hot action movie property, Steven Seagal returned in 1996 to team up with Keenan Ivory Wayans in this action thriller.  No, Seagal is not a great actor, and yes he seemed a little out of shape for this role, but with that mischievous glimmer in his eye and his sardonic approach, he makes THE GLIMMER MAN a more than serviceable adventure.  Giving Seagal a secretive background and a mystical Buddhist persona aids the picture in its quest to be different, although the plot is standard and nothing new or innovative is approached.  But the fight scenes are fun and Seagal and Wayans have a perverse rapport that is enjoyable to watch.  Bob Gunton and Brian Cox are fine villains as well, and a special salute to John W. Jackson as Donald, the security man with an evil smile.  Fun pass the time entertainment.",1118534400,,817,4.606896551724138
88205,3,0790732548,This is not a bad movie to watch (between average and good). A recommendation to those whom like this genre of movie/film. This will not be a fine movie/film if one is looking for good action based movie/film. Enjoy.....,1114992000,,220,4.666666666666667
88206,2,0790732548,"SEAGAL AND KEENEN IVORY WAYANS PLAY TWO COPS THAT'RE GOING AFTER A SERIAL KILLER KNOWN AS THE FAMILY MAN. SEAGAL AND WAYANS ARE DEFINITELY NOT GIBSON AND GLOVER. BUT THIS MOVIE ISN'T AND COULD NEVER BE ''LETHAL WEAPON''. SOME OF THE ACTION IS GOOD, BUT THE MOVIE'S JUST HARD TO SIT THROUGH. AT LEAST KEENEN IVORY WAYANS DOES DELIVER SOME FUNNY MOMENTS. WELL, SEAGAL HAS DONE WORSE MOVIES THAN THIS. BUT THEN AGAIN, SEAGAL HAS ALSO DONE BETTER MOVIES THAN THIS.",1077062400,,460,4.691358024691358
88207,5,0790732548,"This movie is one of my personal favorites. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. You had comedy, drama, suspense and action all rolled into one fantastic movie. Before this movie, I hadn't been a big fan of Keenan Ivory Wayans but he was actually very good in this film. Steven Seagal's performance was excellent and his martial art moves was over the top! I own this video and I never get tired of seeing it. It's all that and a bag of chips!!",1076112000,6,468,4.211111111111111
88208,3,0790732548,"O.K.-- Steven Seagal was not considered for a Best Actor award for this movie (nor for any of his other flicks).  This is, however, an enjoyable little movie -- you just have to get past Seagal's wooden acting, his love beads, and the huge holes in the plot.  Keenen Ivory Wayans' character worked well -- he gets credit for all of the intentional humor, including one particularly funny line.",1061769600,6,393,4.681159420289855
