I enjoyed the subtle humorous interplay between the actors and the parody of love relationship predicaments .  I rented this film from Netflix and am buying it now.",1283558400,,281,4.490196078431373
7971328,2,B00006L93N,"This movie is like BEACH, BLANKET, BINGO -- minus the sophistication. However, the acting is generally better.

You'll find the usual (for Hong Kong) bad mix of comedy and gangsterism (with surprisingly little gunplay). A very diffuse plot going off on all directions. Unsympathetic characters. And cheap locale shots (I didn't feel the urge to visit Okinawa after this).

I rented this to see if Faye Wong could really act without Wong Kar Wai around. I'm convinced now. She's a natural -- tho she doesn't match the depth that Leslie Cheung offers. And it was a huge surprise to hear her speak a line of English near the beginning. I knew she lived in NYC for a short while, but I wasn't expecting it to be so good. She actually makes American English sound quite pretty. (Hear that, Hollywood?!)

7971329,3,B00006L93N,"Well, here we have a nice comedy-romance-gangster movie, not revolutionary but fun to see. There's cleary a big influence of Wong Kar Wa in the way of filming, wich makes that movie more than just another holiday movie. And there's Faye Wong (Chungking express, 2046). You can't resist Faye Wong.",1140652800,,296,4.94
7971330,3,B00006L93N,"This movie is basically about a huge tangeld social web involving stolen money, a gangster, his ex-gf, a cop, his gf, two criminals, a shop owner, etc etc.... it's got faye wong and tony leung ka fai in it as well as leslie cheung... as far as these light hk movies go, this is definitely a better one - it's more thoughtful in the way it handles a lot of the material, and isn't all that predictable... worth seeing if you're a fan of any of the actors or the genre.",1063411200,4,467,4.142857142857143
