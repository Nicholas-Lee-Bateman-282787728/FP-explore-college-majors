The actors are too into it, the scenes used to portray the past are essentially nauseating and its unrealistic in many ways. The idea behind it is good but sadly, the movie itself fell short.",1509753600,,324,4.416666666666667
8642227,1,B00IIC9PY4,"This movie is only half an hour long, but it seems like hours, or days. It reminds me of when I had measles for about two weeks as a child (before there was a vaccine), with a persistent, very high fever.

Time stopped, all senses were intensified so much they hurt, colors were hyper-saturated, and everything looked shimmery like it was baking in a desert. Nothing seemed real, and it was horrifying. It was like living in a nightmare that would never end, but the fever was so high I couldn't sleep. That was 60 years ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday.

That's what watching this movie is like. The strange cinematography even LOOKS feverish, like nothing is real, everything is unnatural, colors are too intense, the look is always either way too sharp or way too fuzzy, and there's something bad wrong with your eyes and brain.

The good people (which includes the gay couple only) are SO good they're cloying, suffocating, nearly as creepy as the overwhelmingly more numerous bad people (everybody else). The bad people are really, REALLY bad, like monsters disguised as humans. All of them are extremely, unvaryingly vicious and hateful.

Nothing anybody says sounds like human beings talking, but like demons, like beings that can say human words but have nothing human inside to give life to the words. The actors all look like dead people, stiffly animated through some sort of jerky special effects.

I don't like horror movies at all, but I'd rather watch a marathon of all the Exorcist movies and all their spin-offs than sit through this horrible movie again.",1490227200,,1584,4.787545787545787

8642229,5,B00IIC9PY4,"Warning!  This is a very emotional short film.  The intensity is nothing short of unbelievable!  Be sure and watch this film with the one you care about and love, only too well.  Really hit home in more ways than I can variably explain.  I am sure that many of you will feel the same pangs of remembrance!  NJMJr!
PS This is one film for the ages.  If love can be signified in any way this film surely represents the very best!!  NJMJr!!",1452816000,,437,4.2439024390243905
