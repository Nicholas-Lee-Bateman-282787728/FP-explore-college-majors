4486401,3,B004WD1J74,"There's so much material in this collection, it's hard to know where to begin.  This is three full-length discs, a compilation of previous Philip Gardiner works:

Disc 1 - The Viking Serpent -- as a tour of ancient sites with religious significance, this is intriguing.  If Vikings are your thing, you will truly enjoy this.  I'm not sure the iconography and numerology add up (pun intended) the way the film claims, but fascinating stuff nevertheless.

Disc 2 - Secrets of the Serpent - in a similar style as Disc 1, this is a good survey/history of snake-worship.  For me, the best part of these are the on-the-ground tours of the ancient sites they're talking about.  Serpents (snakes) have fascinated people through the ages and it's no surprise they're a large part of human religion.  (Incidentally, in the second track of this disc, amid the trailers for other Philip Gardiner films, there's a highly entertaining music video by Jeremy Hinkin.  No idea why it's there, but thanks.)

Disc 3 - The Cross of Thoth - (Okay, say that three times real fast!)  The Cross of Thoth is the Celtic cross which came from the time of Constantine, introduced to England by the Gauls.  The cross is a variation of the ""wheel cross"" or ""Odin's wheel.""  The associations of this cross through the ages are vast and deep and easily occupy this full-length documentary.  Unlike the first two discs of this compilation, this is a sit-down interview with expert Crichton Miller, but rather than a dry lecture, his information is nicely cut with related images which are also presented in split-screen and overlays, a technique other documentaries could emulate.  (And don't switch off the DVD at the end credits, there's still another half-hour of interviews.)",1313884800,6,1746,4.911262798634812

8445004,2,B004WD1J74,I found the music soundtrack so annoying and distracting that I couldn't follow the stories so I can't provide a fair review of the content.  Music  competed with the narrator and sometimes drowned him out. Overall sound quality seemed really poor to me.  Someone else might enjoy these but I couldn't get into them..,1436400000,2,317,4.833333333333333

8445008,4,B004WD1J74,A lot of times when I watch a show like this on tv I feel like it is over before it starts. Especially with all the commercials. Not the case here.  3 dvds packed full of solid info and no breaks!!,1368921600,,197,3.8048780487804876
8445009,5,B004WD1J74,This is a cool set of three dvds covering different topics. I watched these over a few weeks time. I really wanted to digest the content as there is a lot to learn here.  My favorite was the revelations about the number 666. Conspiracy fans will dig this set.,1368835200,,259,4.285714285714286

8445011,4,B004WD1J74,"This set covers serpent worship, Viking history, & the Cross of Thoth--all three subjects of great interest to me.  I think it's obvious why snakes are such a huge part of our religions & culture, as they have been our natural enemies since we began.  What is interesting though is that serpents have been singled out so, as we have many other animal enemies...anyway, this DVD was pretty much what I was looking for.",1353369600,,417,4.621621621621622
8445012,4,B004WD1J74,"This 3 disc set of conspiracy DVDs covers Vikings, snake worship, and the Celtic cross. Philip Gardiner always presents these entertaining topics with much detail. Whenever I watch his films it's like being taken on a tour of the the ancient sites. There's so much detail and things to really think about. I love films like that! Whether all of it is true or not isn't the point, but keeping an open mind and mulling over other possibilities and answers is what keeps me coming back to his latest releases.",1314489600,,506,4.633333333333334
