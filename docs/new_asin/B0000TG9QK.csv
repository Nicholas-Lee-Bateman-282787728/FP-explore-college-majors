8002765,2,B0000TG9QK,"This DVD appears to be an entire TV show from Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) from 1986.  Picture quality is clear, sound quality is poor.  You get used to it after a while, but go in expecting that.
The only reason that I didn't give this one star is because it's nice to see some old school material on the market.  However, the information on the cover isn't really that useful.  I probably would still have bought the DVD if I had known that this was a TV show presented in its entirety, since it's pretty reasonably priced.  However, I was more than a little upset to find out that the Flair/Windham match mentioned on the back cover was only a clip, and to find out that the whole thing only ran 38 minutes.  That's good info to put on the packaging!
Onto the program (I'm not going to mention the interviews, although there were a few)!
Dusty Rhodes introduces the material, if you weeeell.
Gordon Solie and Buddy Colt are the announcers.
A clip from Lex Luger vs. Jesse Barr is shown.
1. The Black Ninja (aka The Great Muta) vs. Prince Iaukea (***/5)
This match had a surprisingly modern feel to it, with Muta's high spots.  Best match on the DVD.
2. Hector Guerrero vs. Lex Luger (*/5)
Not a whole lot to this one, but it is really early footage of Luger, and that was interesting to see.
3. Kevin Sullivan/Maya Sighn/The Purple Haze vs. Tony D'Amata/Jim Backlund/Mike Allen (none/5)
SQUASH!!!
4. Kendell Windham vs. Mark Benedict (1/2*/5)
Kendell works the arm.  Not much else to this one.
5. Ric Flair vs. Barry Windham (grr.../5)
This is the reason I was disappointed with this DVD.  What is shown is part of their match at ""Battle of the Belts 2,"" joined in progress (Solie says about 40 minutes in), and left in progress.  That's right, no pinfall, no nothing.  Only a couple of minutes of footage from the middle of a match.  We get to see the Flair Flip in the corner, which of course leads to him climbing the ropes and failing with the double axe-handle.  Did I mention they didn't even show the end?
6. Blackjack Mulligan vs. La Amenaza Roja & The Marauder (none/5)
Handicap SQUASH!!!
And Dusty Rhodes comes back, pimping the ""Turnbuckle Memories"" series.  End of DVD.",1070323200,5,2197,4.543147208121828
