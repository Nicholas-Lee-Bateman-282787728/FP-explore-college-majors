It was the first TV show on Saturday morning for me in the 1950's, I was glued to my 12 inch or so Sylvania TV and it stayed with me the rest of my life. This DVD is all I could wish for.",1185926400,,244,3.537037037037037

The Big Picture was on TV regularly and will be familiar to many baby boomers. These are all black and white episodes and the films have not been restored.
