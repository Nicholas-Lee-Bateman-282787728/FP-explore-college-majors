8193546,5,B000FBATA0,"I realize these cartoons were only put together about 15 years ago, but the comics on which they are based were all written between about 1930 and 1976; the 2 parts of Tintin's moon saga were written about 13 years before Apollo 11.

The fact of the matter is, Herge was a creative genius. Yes, the Tintin material is a bit trite, but that's one of many things that makes it so enjoyable. The exotic locales and ridiculous stories are endlessly entertaining for their inherent charm. Seasoned and skeptical Tintin fans may question the merit of these cartoons relative to the original comics, but rest assured: Herge would be proud of them. The animation is quite good, and the artwork is extremely faithful to Herge's originals. Having only seen the English versions, I don't think I'm qualified to comment on the original French language tracks, but I expect that the voices and language are the only substantive difference, and I can't possibly see any reason why the originals would be worse than the dubs, which are superb for Tintin fans of all ages and forms.",1161993600,6,1066,4.762162162162162
