8644345,5,B00IOZCWGI,"Ive been studying for years on archeology in north and south America and it was finally pleasant to see a documentary that gives a different light than what most historians keep saying that America was full of only hunter gatherers, which is not true.  Too many sites in Columbia and along the Yucatan that are never talked about in history classes.  Yes it is possible that Carthaginian merchants sailing west of Africa found South America.  And there is sufficient archeology out there unexcavated that points to Carthaginian possibilities mixing with the powerful civilizations of South America and Central America.",1492646400,,618,5.222222222222222

8644350,2,B00IOZCWGI,"This would be alright if your were in 5th Grade.  Very disappointing and boring.  I could only watch it half way through, then fast forward to see if there would be anything of interest.  There was nothing.  The announcer was also putting me to sleep.",1404518400,,251,4.511111111111111
8644351,3,B00IOZCWGI,Weak at best a waste of time it proved nothing they should have waited until they gather more proof.,1404086400,4,100,4.315789473684211
8644352,1,B00IOZCWGI,"This pseudoscience is way below PBS. As an archaeologist myself, it's terribly disappointing to see this kind of material being aired on public television. There isn't a single shred of evidence archaeologically, historically, or logically that links Carthage in any remote way to South America. The fact that I am sitting here typing that says something about how stupid PBS thinks their viewers are.",1401580800,6,401,5.28125
8644353,2,B00IOZCWGI,"I saw a documentary that suggested that the Chinese may have discovered the Americans approximately 40 years before Columbus did.  A documentary called ""Ice Age Columbus"" explains how Europeans during the Ice Age may have made it to the Americas.  A book called ""They Came Before Columbus"" which hypothesizes that sub-Saharan Africans may have traveled to South America before Columbus.  This DVD asks if Carthaginians may have made it as far away as Peru during the times of the Roman Empire.
Asking such a question doesn't bother me.  In fact, I think it's quite healthy.  However, this felt too hodgepodge.  The work seemed like it was gleaning for info.  The documentary about whether Amazon females live in Mongolia was stronger than this.  They mention so much about the conquistadores that it doesn't help the idea that circum-Mediterranean people may have done it more than 1,000 years before.  They show blond and Titian indigenous individuals in South America, but then admit, ""Maybe their hair is not based upon European ancestors, but on simple genetic variation.""  In this ""post-racial"" world, maybe it can't be brought up.  However, there have been cases of Europeans seeing great architecture in other lands and opining, ""Obviously, our people must have been here in the past, because the local people are not clever enough to make something like this.""  The word ""Eurocentrism"" never comes up in this work.  The work shows a dagger that has the shape of a bull or antler on it and suggests this may be a sign of the Old World in the New.  Perhaps that is so.  However, maybe an indigenous American just carved an imaginary creature who, by chance, looks like an animal the artist may have never seen.",1401235200,7,1716,4.909722222222222
