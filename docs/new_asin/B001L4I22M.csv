3678390,5,B001L4I22M,"Young Tom Hiddleston was very glamorous. And this movie told the story of middle-aged women in mid-life crisis, it's a very fine and smooth.",1357344000,5,140,4.875
3678391,5,B001L4I22M,"This is actually a very simple movie that feels real.
I love the acting and the real life feel of this movie.
Yes I got this for Tom Hiddleston and I'm glad I did, this is a great performance.
I just wish I could have actually seen the SPOILER fight between Tom's character and his father.",1446422400,,289,4.178571428571429
3678392,2,B001L4I22M,"This is a very awkward, unpleasant movie.  The themes are significant -midlife crisis, infertility, and friendship, but the haphazard method of bringing these to screen is sophmoric instead of fresh.",1440806400,2,199,5.633333333333334
3678393,5,B001L4I22M,"Unrelated (2008) is Joanna Hoggs first feature film.  She had worked as a photographer and in television before deciding she wanted more freedom and control over her work.  This film, to my mind, shows that from the get-go,  this filmmaker was in possession of a unique voice, a clear vision and the technical skill to bring that voice and vision to life.

Hogg is a patient director,  she allows a scene to unfold in what feels like  what often is  real time; the result is something akin to Cinema Verit.  Her camera is often still and placed mid-range rather than panning across the scene or moving in close for a tight shot.  She films on location and does not use sets but rather has her cast not only act out their roles in situ, but has them stay/live during filming in those locations, as well.

For Unrelated the setting is primarily a rented villa in Tuscany and a few scenes in near-by Siena.
As with Hoggs two subsequent films: Archipelago (see my review) and Exhibition  the cast is comprised of  actors and non-actors.  In brief, the story  is that of a Anna (Kathryn Worth) who , experiencing something of a mid-life crisis, comes to Italy to spend a vacation with her friend and former school mate, Verena (Mary Roscoe) and her family.  While there she finds herself increasingly drawn away from Verena and the other olds and more attracted to the youngs  in particular Verenas nephew, the cocky, attractive Oakley (Tom Hiddleston.)  Those who follow Tom Hiddlestons career know that Unrelated was his first film, as well, just weeks out of drama school,  and that he is the lead character in Archipelago (2010) and has a smaller role in Exhibition. (2013)  The three roles are vastly different and speak to his considerable talent and range.  He has been referred to as Hoggs muse.

One of the key elements in all of this directors work is the use of sound  and of silence.
She is adept at filling the spaces between words and action with deep meaning.  There is an oblique quality to her story telling.  Wonderfully effective is her way of having the rare moments of high drama  in Unrelated it is a brutal argument between the young Oakley (Hiddleston) and his father  (David Rintoul)  occur off screen so that we hear the confrontation, but never see it, rather,  we witness other members of the family  and Anna (the unrelated guest)  react to it.  Like them, our imaginations are free to supply images of what we can not know for certain is happening inside the house.  The film is

It seems that one either gets these films or doesnt.  Some find them boring, slow and the characters remote  others, myself included, feel them to be intimate, beautifully paced and deeply affecting.  If you are among the latter then you will find Joanna Hoggs Unrelated to be a rewarding gem.

3678394,5,B001L4I22M,"Joanna Hog writes stories that really show emotions without going overboard.  As a ""woman of a certain age"", I felt completely at home seeing the family through Anna's eyes.  She was realistic about where she was, what was going on, and this is no Disney movie.  All of the characters had both good qualities and some they should work on.  I like ""slice of life"" movies that are realistic and this really fits the bill.  Next I will watch her second in the series, Archipelago, soon.",1425945600,2,483,4.569767441860465

3678403,5,B001L4I22M,"Joanna Hogg's films are raw and emotional and real life.  I love the family dynamics of her films because it feels like you're watching an unscripted documentary about a family.  The rocky relationships of a father and son, and a blended family, and a relationship between a husband and wife are rough and real and full of human emotion, which is what I find most interesting about this film.  I find that her films are not the type that you watch everyday, rather more of a watch it once think about it for a few days to a few weeks then watch it again.  Unrelated has more going on in it, with the teenagers antics and plights, if you haven't seen anything by Joanna yet its a good starter film for you to watch. The entire cast is brilliant,  the scenery of Florence is beautiful.  On occasion you hear the actors call Tom Hiddleston by his real name but I sorta like that about it, you can tell they lived as these characters and the lines of reality became blurred.  i just found that so interesting.",1417478400,5,1005,4.370967741935484

Maybe one needs to be British to find such excruciatingly embarrassing experiences funny; I just sat there and cringed a lot. I don't think I'll watch it a second time anytime soon.",1404777600,2,306,4.581818181818182

8317154,5,B001L4I22M,"I love the immersive quality of Joanna Hogg films. The stillness. The reality, a day in the life of. They're not for everyone for sure though. SPOILERS, turn away or be forewarned. I loved the chemistry that builds between Anna and Oakley, despite their age difference... when he stands behind her and reaches over her at breakfast you feel the mutual awareness of both of them, crackling in the air around them. They have a lovely time of connecting and Anna gets to feel young & alive again. Then, ouch. When Oak pulls away and turns his attentions elsewhere I felt it... I literally felt it pull at my heart. Probably because I've known those kind of boys. The fight between Oak and his dad, also painful. Just awful. I would have liked to see it, instead of just hear it, but it was pretty powerful to just watch everyone else listening to it too. Uncomfortable, sad. Everyone in this film did a great job, and it was great to see how good Tom Hiddleston was even in his early acting days. It's funny when you can hear Anna's character call Oakley ""Tom"" at one point in the film, but another reviewer pointed out that they all live together on set in Joanna Hogg films, so it makes sense that the lines start to become burred sometimes. I found myself thinking about this film for days afterwards as well",1494806400,,1308,4.476987447698745

Most of the film involved a group of people of varying ages walking around aimlessly and playing silly games while failing to establish more than extremely superficial relationships. When what plot there was unfolded and I found out that the older woman in the group was depressed about more than rejection from one of the young men, I wanted to fold it back.
