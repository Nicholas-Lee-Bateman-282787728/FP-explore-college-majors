8367597,1,B000UUX2TQ,"This review is NEGATIVE but with a very POSITIVE reccommendation!! Though I LOVE the work of Donnie Harper and the New Jersey Mass Choir...this DVD was awful! The visual clarity was very poor and the content substandard. It seemed like the performance was a mandatory ""Wednesday night"" rehearsal. Donnie and the choir appeared very ""low-keyed""...a totally lackluster event. This should not have been packaged and SOLD to the public. I viewed the DVD ONCE and was NOT inpired to waste any more of my time. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!

For two (2) WONDERFUL DVDs of this group I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND ""Hope Of The World"" and ""At Their Best""!!(See my reviews). YOU WILL BE VERY PLEASED AND SATISFIED!!",1201564800,5,692,4.864406779661017
