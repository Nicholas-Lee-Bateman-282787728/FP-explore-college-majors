8334546,4,B001PSVHKS,"Introduction: The two DVD set `Dances of Ecstasy - A Sensory Journey Through Rhythm, Dance And Music' is an overall entertaining and informative though somewhat incomplete examination of rhythmic movement and the role it plays in attaining mystical experience.

Summary:
The first disc is presented in documentary format spiriting the audience off to various locations around the globe to introduce us to how various spiritual traditions use rhythmic music and dance as an integral component to obtain divine presence. Our journey begins in New York with an introduction by Gabrielle Roth and then whisks the viewer off to such exotic locales as Namibia, Korea, Turkey, Australia, Brazil and several others destinations.

The second disc titled `The Power Wave' is a instructional program geared to those who wish to respond to the information presented in the first disc and desire to learn how to incorporate dance or rhythmic movement into their own spiritual practices. This dance gestalt is presented by Gabrielle Roth in her New York studio. She outlines what she considers to be the five universal rhythms; flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. As Ms. Roth discusses the nuances of each rhythm a group of students gyrate across the wooden studio floor to visually demonstrate her narrated lesson.

Critique: I enjoyed the first disc. The script was well conceived, intelligent and followed with the on screen visuals and the musical soundtrack. I think the films attempt to present solid reasoning for the true spiritual seeker to discard their reliance on intellectual processes and surrender to universal frequencies in order to attain higher spiritual awareness was overall successful. On a personal note, I experienced a discernable shift in my own consciousness as I watched the program. My breathing pattern became slower and shallow, coupled with a calming stillness lasting long after the completion of the program. That in itself attests to the reality of the phenomenon this program examines.

On the negative side I felt the mood attained by the film came at the sacrifice of what should have been a more comprehensive survey. To leave Hinduism and Chinese or Tibetan Buddhism out of this exploration was surprising to say the least. To consciously omit such ancient and widely practiced traditions with rich legacies in dance and movement out of the film is in my estimation unthinkable.

As for disc two, I can definitely see the value of presenting to the audience an invitation to 'partake in the  dance' and experience these universal frequencies firsthand. That being so, the value or lack thereof of this disc should be evaluated by those interested in progressing from passive observer to active participant in the process. Since I have decided to remain a passive observer, at least for now, it's not for me to provide a value judgement on the possible benefits and insights offered in this presentation.",1282003200,23,2942,5.19620253164557
