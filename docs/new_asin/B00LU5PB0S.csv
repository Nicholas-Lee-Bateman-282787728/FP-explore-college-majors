6506803,5,B00LU5PB0S,I love it! I bought it as a yankee swap present and it was a good gift!,1419206400,,71,3.235294117647059
6506804,4,B00LU5PB0S,"Two of the movies on are here are excellent and the other two bore me.  ""Miss Grant Takes Richmond"" and ""The Fuller Brush Girl"" are my favorites on here.

""Miss Grant Takes Richmond""
Lucille Ball plays Ellen Grant in ""Miss Grant Takes Richmond"".  The very beginning of the movie is hilarious as you see her struggling thru secretary school having obvious problems with her typewriter.  Actor Charles Lane (who guest-starred in MANY TV show of the 1950s-1960s such as ""Bewitched"" and ""I Love Lucy"") plays her instructor Mr. Woodruff.  He becomes shocked when actor Bill Holden who plays Dick Richmond chooses Ellen out of all the girls in her class as his personal secretary.  Unbeknownst to Mr. Woodruff and Ellen, Mr. Dick Richmond operates a gambling operation with a real-estate office being used as his cover-up so that's why he purposely chose Ellen who gets into a lot of messes trying to help with the low-income housing shortage.  There are some great funny moments in this.

""The Fuller Brush Girl""
Eddie Albert, popular from the hit TV series ""Green Acres"", stars as Humphrey Briggs.  Humphrey is Lucille Ball's character, Sally Elliot's, fiance.  The two have EXCELLENT chemistry in this and their characters have been engaged for some time but unable to afford a home of their own.  They both work at the same company and are able to put a down-payment on their dream home when Humphrey is promoted to manager status but Sally gets fired when she gets cosmetics from a makeup demonstration from a fuller brush girl all over her telephone switchboard which causes a fire.  She then decides to become a fuller brush girl herself with hilarious results leading to prospective clients hair falling out after giving them a permanent and becoming mixed up in a murder.  VERY funny!

And as I said previously, the other two movies personally bore me.  I wish they would have included Lucy's movie ""Easy to Wed"" with Van Johnson or ""The Facts of Life"" with Bob Hope.  Both are very good but very difficult to find to buy.  Instead included are ""The Magic Carpet"" of which Lucille Ball hardly gets any screen time.  You don't see Lucille until after the first 12 minutes of the film.  Actor George Tobias, who played Abner Kravitz on the TV show ""Bewitched"", even seems to get more screen time when Lucille is listed as being first-billed.  It just doesn't seem like a ""Lucy"" movie.  And ""Her Husband's Affairs"" was a HUGE disappointment.  Very boring and I couldn't stand actor Franchot Tone's character in the movie.",1416182400,4,2521,4.813953488372093
6506805,5,B00LU5PB0S,"wonderful movie thanks. You cant miss with the 1st lady of comedy

6506806,5,B00LU5PB0S,"I confess that I have not watched every movie yet, but I couldn't wait to recommend THE MAGIC CARPET to all the folks who love crap. This was the movie that Harry Cohn used to try to get Lucy to break her contract. She's so terrible it wouldn't have hurt her performance a bit if she'd chewed gum. She's actually worse than John Agar who never looked more wooden or uncomfortable. There's always something happening in this movie, all of it bad and all of it wonderful.",1414022400,2,469,4.402298850574713
6506807,4,B00LU5PB0S,"I purchased this set to get a less-expensive and proper DVD copy (not a costly DVD-R) of ""The Magic Carpet"" (I'm a collector of swashbuckler films), but I also really enjoyed ""Miss Grant Takes Richmond"".  I've not yet seen ""The Fuller Brush Girl"", but ""Her Husband's Affairs"" is truly dreadful -- a stupid story made excruciating by an egregiously-sexist premise and continual sexist remarks.  Franchot Tone as the ad-man husband is irked by Lucille Ball as the intelligent, capable wife who continually gets him out of jams.  She promises to be a good wife and go back to the kitchen.  Yikes!  I'm not a politically-correct, hyper-sensitive feminist-type, but that movie is cringe-inducing.  I don't know why Mill Creek put it in this collection.

Anyway, ""Miss Grant"" is a great comedy: brisk, witty, and just plain fun.  ""The Magic Carpet"" is a b-movie swashbuckler, but I enjoy it, and it's improved a good deal by 1.3X playback on my DVD player.  These two films alone are worth the $12 this set cost.",1414022400,,1006,4.83625730994152
6506808,5,B00LU5PB0S,"I had been looking for the Fuller Brush Girl movie for sometime, so when I found this, I couldn't resist.  Great price for all four movies.",1413590400,2,139,4.346153846153846
6506809,5,B00LU5PB0S,"This is a great collection from Mill Creek in partnership with Sony Pictures. This collection is just the same as the Sony Pictures Choice Collection of Lucille Ball, but this one is pressed and not MOD. The quality of all four films are quite good and this collection doesn't have any subtitles or other audio besides English. ""Her Husband's Affair"" and ""Miss Grant Takes Richmond"" is on one disk and ""The Fuller Brush Girl"" and ""The Magic Carpet"" is on the second disk. All movies except ""The Magic Carpet"" are in black and white and all movies are in Fullscreen format.

6506810,5,B00LU5PB0S,"Who doesn't love Lucy, or just needs use a laugh? How about just an ""I can't believe what I'm watching"" reaction as you watch?

The four Lucille Ball feature films in this 2-disc Mill Creek set run the gamut of pretty good, kind of weird, so-bad-it's-delightful and best of the bunch. All four are nicely restored, so if you've been trying to find decent copies of them on various budget DVDs, you'll have them here.

THE MAGIC CARPET (1951)
Co-starring John Agar and Patricia Medina

This infamous so-bad-it's-delightful ""sort of color, sort of spectacular"" adventure/fantasy/comedy is notable for several reasons. Check out this history from everythinglucy/dot/com:

""Hoping to force Lucille Ball into breaking her contract, Columbia Pictures chieftain Harry Cohn assigned her to the low-budget Arabian Nights escapade The Magic Carpet. Much to Cohn's amazement, the plucky Ball agreed to appear in the film, forcing Columbia to pay her salary until her option ran out. While Lucille Ball is quite attractive in her harem duds, the viewer cannot help but notice that her bare midriff is often obscured by props and furniture; that's because she was pregnant with her daughter Lucie Arnaz during the filming of The Magic Carpet.""

The Magic Carpet also co-stars (and what old movie did NOT co-star?) George Tobias and the comic relief sidekick--and Raymond Burr as the scheming villain. Imagine Abner Kravitz and Perry Mason in the The Arabian Nights and there's even more to chortle about.

HER HUSBAND'S AFFAIRS (1947)
Co-starring Franchot Tone

A lower-echelon Adam's Rib crossed with a kind of weird Son of Flubber, Her Husband's Affairs is not about infidelity, but about a wife who is (GASP!) more talented and savvy than her pompous, egomaniacal husband. Those who cringe at the pre-feminist aspects of films of a long ago mindset might want to skip Franchot Tone's insufferable whining and fuming about how Lucille Ball bails him out time after time. To be positive, it might be interpreted as a statement about how women should have been treated and were not.

Anyway, it goes from a husband-and-wife conflict story to a very odd fantasy sitcom about wacky inventions and their consequences. Ball is fine as ever, but Tone is probably miscast because his overall disaffected, cool style makes his character unlikable, while a more genial actor might have pulled off the role of this dolt at least a little better.

MISS GRANT TAKES RICHMOND (1949)
Co-Starring William Holden

Ball and Holden play masterfully against each other in this pretty good, Damon Runyonesque tale of ""a lovable bunch of bookies and their dashing leader who would reform if only the right woman could change him.""

Lovers of I Love Lucy can revel in the comparisons between Holden and Ball in this film and Holden and Lucy Ricardo in the famous ""nose-lighting"" episode of the classic series. What makes this extra special for classic TV fans is the appearance of Gloria Henry--Dennis the Menace's mom--as one of the young postwar newlyweds. She looks a little different, but there is no mistaking that lovely voice.

THE FULLER BRUSH GIRL (1950)
Co-Starring Eddie Albert

Like Miss Grant Takes Richmond, this is one of the most widely played of Ball's film comedies. Of all four in this set, it's the best of the bunch for its snappy pace, beautifully timed slapstick, engaging story and the chemistry between Ball and Arnold, who play the postwar couple this time around.

If you watch this with young people, you might have to start by explaining that Fuller Brush people were like Avon or Mary Kay sales people who went door-to-door with household gadgets or, in this case, beauty products. Ball and Anold's characters are as hapless as can be and you can see each successive catastrophe mounting a mile away, but that's part of the fun and part of the filmmaker's craft.

It was also scripted by Looney Tunes director turned Hollywood movie director Frank Tashlin, so like his Jerry Lewis hits, the action is very cartoony and was very likely storyboarded in the same way as animation.

Only one year away from becoming Lucy Ricardo, The Fuller Brush Girl is a prelude to I Love Lucy for Lucille Ball as well for her fans. You can imagine see how Ethel, Fred and Ricky might have reacted to all the zany hijinks.",1412812800,9,4300,4.934903047091413
