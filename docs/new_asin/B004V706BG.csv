But to be clear, there are no subtitles; I'm not sure if some site says there is, but is unfortunately not the case. Contrary to what Amazons picture may lead you to believe, the front cover is Crow (instead of Ganta and Shiro) with the same ""Deadman Wonderland"" lettering and includes everything you see in in Vol. 1, minus the black foldable picture stand (different art and mini manga of course). Honestly couldn't even navigate through the menu, so IDK about bonus content, but would venture to guess it is textureless openers and some promotional trailers.

I do want to mention again the beauty and quality of this case. Like Vol. 1, it's the best packaging I've ever seen; plastic (not cardboard) slip cover, bi-fold style case (not some flimsy snap-close one). Extra thought was put into the design, all the way down to the part that holds the CD; You actually get a tactile ""button"" feel when pressing to release the CD, and actually chuckled in amazement when I thought about how you sometimes have to fight the case/cd just to get it out of a regular Jo-Shmo case. the design and quality alone are worth nothing less than 5 stars.

Recap - Don't buy unless you want the OST, an ornament for your shelf, or can understand Japanese. I bought it for the OST, and will look amazing on my shelf when I get all 6 volumes.",1379116800,,1640,5.228136882129277
