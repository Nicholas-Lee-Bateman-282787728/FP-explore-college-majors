8120530,1,B000FC2EYS,"Bad acting, worse directing, and a lousy script torpedo this deservedly obscure indie film that looks as if it were filmed in an outhouse. Stephen Neave is especially bad in a ""performance"" that's highly derivative of Al Pacino's acting techniques. The movie is about a party that seems to go on and on and on. The guests appear to be trapped. I kept waiting for some murders to happen. Alas, none ever do!

I would advise you to purchase this dvd only if you need an object to toss into the fireplace some chilly winter evening. You would at least have the pleasure of watching it burn to a cinder.",1243728000,,599,4.445454545454545
8120531,5,B000FC2EYS,"If you're looking for a character movie about people you'd recognize, then this is a great choice. A wonderful product of the ongoing digitial/indie film world. I look forward to seeing Matt Zoller Seitz's next production!",1155686400,3,222,5.194444444444445
