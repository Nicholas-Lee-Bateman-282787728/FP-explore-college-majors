8490918,3,B00028LRGQ,"I ordered this DVD thinking it would be professionally done.  It seemed like just Massad speaking to a few people, and for a short time.  I liked what he said as usual, but there wasn't enough of it.  It seemed like just a taping of an informal gathering.  The rest of the DVD is filled with other stuff used just for filler.",1215907200,12,325,4.193548387096774
