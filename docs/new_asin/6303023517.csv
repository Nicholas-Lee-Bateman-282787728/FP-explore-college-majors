This is about a man who lends a lipstick camera to his friend( and secret love interest) Omy.  She finds  out her boyfriend cheated on her and now the woman is missing without a  trace.

She gets her chance to be a  real reporter as she tapes the confession of her guilty boyfriend. A  stirring story.

7835719,3,6303023517,"This is your average movie of the week that has a nice looking cast that gave good performances. I'm not sure why this was given a R rating? because it is very tame in the violence, cursing and the  sex dept.
The story is about a wannabe videographer/reporter who hooks up with a veteran shooter, but is shunned at first. Our leading lady won't take NO for an answer and follows the shooter to a clients house and lets just say she leaves something behind.
She is aided by her BFF Corey who is in blank and her antics leads everyone in a heap of trouble.
The plot is decent enough although it is easy to figure out who's who and who the bad guy(s) are/is early on.
This is a decent time burner when you can't find a great show to watch or doesn't require a lot of thought or attention on the viewers part. 3 decent stars.",1405814400,,821,4.163522012578617
7835720,2,6303023517,This is a B movie wanna-be. Not terrible but certainly not one that I'd recommend. I'd suggest skipping this one.,1381622400,,113,4.7
7835721,3,6303023517,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a pretty run
of the mill B-movie thriller for the most part. The last thirty minutes are
really pretty good. The film is well acted by the leads and Corey Feldman
is good at some comic relief and provides a touching tender moment in the
film. It is not something I would want to see again but the film was worth
the VOD rental price.",1289952000,3,396,4.089743589743589

7835723,1,6303023517,"Other reviewers have given the plot, so I'll skip that part. I watched this and don't understand what the excitement is about. Bergman is a prop here, with very little actual camera time. There is about 5 seconds of tension, and when the tense moments are resolved (the scene could have lasted longer), the ending becomes clear. Too predictable for me.",1175299200,,352,4.786885245901639
