8338348,5,B001RNU1T4,If you like old musicals from the 30's you will like this musical comedy.  Gloria Jean had a beautiful voice. I have been trying to get a dvd of this movie for years. This was made in 1939 15 years before I was born.  I love this movie and hope to see it again before I pass on. Gloria  Jean  sings the best version of Annie Laurie that I have ever heard. My older brother sang it to me and I sang it for my Great niece.,1493856000,,420,3.793103448275862
