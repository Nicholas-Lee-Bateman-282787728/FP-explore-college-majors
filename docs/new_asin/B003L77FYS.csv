4137666,5,B003L77FYS,I N T E N S E.  On EVERY level!  Writing.  Acting.  Arc development.  Fan satisfaction.  WE HAD TO OWN IT!!!  This show just keeps on getting better and better.,1295913600,,160,4.133333333333334
4137667,5,B003L77FYS,"Love the show!  Great cast ensemble, great tension between Beckett and Castle and fun story plots.  Father-daughter relationship is one of the best I've seen in a TV series.  I liked Nathan Fillion when he was starring in Firefly and Serenity.  In one espisode Castle dresses up in his Firefly garb and the tongue and cheek jokes start to roll.  Great show!",1294963200,3,357,4.693548387096774
4137668,5,B003L77FYS,"Castle Season is very funny, romantic and action packed.  I particularly liked episode 9, ""Close Encounters of the Murderous Kind"" as Castle made reference to his former character on the shows Serenity and Firefly.  Becket asks why he knows Chinese and he says it's from a show he learned it from a show he use to like. If you are not familiar with his previous work it won't be funny.  I love the interaction between Becket and Castle.  This is an excellent show.  Can you have a light hearted murder?  Absolutely!  I enjoy the interaction between Castle and his mother and daughter as well.  Castle's mother wears great clothing and jewelry.  If you like fashion this show is for you as it's also very stylish.",1289865600,,712,4.632
4137669,5,B003L77FYS,"This is another amazing episode of Castle, well written and the chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic is great this show has a little of everything Its funny but also can be serious. Good cop show and very character driven.",1286755200,,234,4.7317073170731705

And the side characters are just as much fun! Castle's daughter is the kind of girl we'd all want for a BFF. His mom is hilariously free-spirited. The guys at the precinct are great, too.

The series focused on them and the supporting cast supported them instead of having to become the main players in the latter seasons. It's my daughter's favorite show and we've enjoyed many hours together watching it.",1481587200,,396,4.513888888888889

4138026,2,B003L77FYS,"There are spoilers in this review  This will probably be my last season of Castle.  I liked the first two seasons enough to keep  watching. Although, three things annoyed me from the beginning. Those were Beckett pretending like she's not attracted to Castle (which, I realize was necessary at first), the interference of the grandmother and Beckett, in the way Castle parents his daughter, and the daughters attitude. True, Beckett was a teen-aged gir once, but her life was nothing like Castle's' daughter's.  Why is he going to her for advice? And, why doesnt he realize that her advice is always terrible? Surely, as a cop, Beckett knows the dangers of NY for a young woman alone, even in Manhattan. But, she reads him the riot act for putting a tracker on the phone he pays for, but lets her use? Especially when he knew she was lying about where she was going. I'd say, he was within his rights, to know where his daughter is at all times. In fact, that is a parents responsibility, when their kids aren't grown.  Then his mom, is also too lax, ""Oh Richard, let her go in her bedroom with her adult music teacher, and stay up there with the door closed the entire time....""  Who cares, if nobody ever met the guy before?  The daughter on the show is also one of those new teen characters that reprimand their parents, for parenting them. Then the milktoast parents actually apologize to their child, for setting limits.  Nice example, for all the kiddies watching at home.
Here we are, three seasons (TV years) later, and Beckett is still playing the ""I'm clueless about my feelings for Castle"" game. This season they added a new team of regulars, hiding their relationship from their supposed friends at work. I am not sure why two single people would hide the fact that thryre dating, when  there doesn't seem to be a policy against it. Its not like it wasn't obvious in their scenes together at crime scenes/work.  Babe. This season, Castle comes off as a serious stalker.  Beckett's flight, for instance, was it a shock that Castle was on the plane? Nope.  Then, he got them a suite together, and conveniently forgot to tell the staff that it wasn't a romantic vacation, when he booked the room.  Did the trained detective see this behavior as the red flag it would be in real life? Oh no. Not even the thousands of dollars hed spent on her up to that point, didn't tip her off that he could be too obsessed?  Also, what about the room she booked? You cant cancel hotel reservations the day you're supposed to arrive, without some financial penalties. I suppose, Rick handled that too  Also, Beckett's boyfriend the surgeon, is so much hotter, fit, and interesting,  than Castle. And, he's a humanitarian heart surgeon! But, she'd rather be with a man who is smothering her, and they're not even dating yet. Finally, when the captain was most likely going to meet his death; did he call other officers for back-up? No. Did he just tell Beckett on the phone that it was a setup? No. He called a writer, who doesnt even carry a gun! Why? Because nobody else can handle Beckett, when shes all emotional?  Stupid, and not even true",1477267200,,3137,4.593189964157706

The supporting characters, such as Castle's mom and daughter as well as Esposito and Ryan, really bring depth to the series and a level of humor that keeps me smiling from beginning to end. Episodes are intense and even better than the first two season. Let's just say I'm glad I discovered this show after season 3 came out on DVD. I don't think I could stand having to wait a week to find out what happened next. Quality of episodes on disc were perfect and I didn't notice any problems with playback, so well done ABC. If you haven't seen this season or are feeling like you need to see them again, this is a must watch.",1471478400,,772,4.368055555555555
4138202,5,B003L77FYS,"I got hooked on this show a few months ago. Kind of goofy, but still a good crime drama with romantic tension in the air. What more can you ask?

I tend to be a TV snob, watching mostly documentaries and movies that have some artistic or social quality.  That doesn't mean I'm too good for some basic, fun to watch entertainment, and this does the job.  Castle's character is a successful millionaire, but just goofy and vulnerable enough, plus ok looking but not over the top good looking to keep him from seeming somewhat believable.  Beckett's character is so good looking, confident, and successful that it's hard to imagine her ever seeing anything in Castle, but the chemistry is undeniable and they use that to tease the viewer into coming back episode after episode and season after season.

The plots are, for the most part, original and refreshing, but far enough from reality that you have to just go along and stop reminding yourself that these things would never happen in real life and that nobody would survive the predicaments that confront the characters on each episode.  I am former law enforcement and know that none of the things on this should would ever happen, but again ... I don't care.  Sometimes you just need to escape reality for an hour or two.

One of the real surprises for me has been Susan Sullivan.  After watching her as the uptight Kitty Montgomery on Dharma and Greg, I couldn't have imagined her playing any other character.  In Castle, she plays Martha - Castles whacky mother, who is an over-the-top, past her prime actress, with a multitude of character flaws, but who is nonetheless loveable.",1470873600,,1636,4.72887323943662

Excellent writers, great storyline, excellent actors and secondary storylines that support the current episode, romance with the bumps that make it real, surprises, etc. This show has it all. I highly recommend it. The series currently has 8 seasons. I liked it so well I bought all 8 seasons.

I love that James Patterson, Mike Connelly and other very famous writers appear as guest stars on the show. Wonderful! Good chemistry between lead actor and actress, which is important since there is always that tension between them. I still think they could do more to flesh out the personalities and histories of co-stars, but all in all extremely entertaining and enjoyable. I think the series in general gets 5 stars, but this season was frustrating in some parts. I am finding season4 much more suspenseful and detailed. GREAT SHOW!!!!",1439596800,,632,5.0285714285714285

4139629,5,B003L77FYS,"I love a good murder mystery, but I prefer them on the lighter side of things.  Add some humor and I'm hooked.  So you can imagine how much I enjoy Castle, a show that mixes mystery with humor.  Season 3 continues the fun.

This season picks up a few months after the last season ended.  It's been a few months since Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) has heard from writer Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion).  Last she'd heard, he was heading off to the Hamptons to finish up the second Nikki Heat novel he's writing based on her, the reason that he shadows her at work and helps her solve cases.  So you can imagine how surprised she is to find him leaning over a dead body when she responds to a hot tip.  Yes, she arrests him, but they quickly work through that issue by finding the real killer, and their partnership returns to normal.

Which means we get 24 episodes of fun mysteries.  The 200 year old bullet in a corpse leads Castle to think they are hunting for a time traveling killer.  A psychics murder comes complete with a letter predicting her death.  An alien abduction appears to be the cause of death for another murder.  They've got cases involving magicians and strippers.  And in a fun twist, the actress set to play Nikki Heat in the movie version of Castle's first book shows up to shadow Beckett to better portray the character.

But it's not all fun, games, and unusual cases.  A serial killer returns to town and picks up where he left off.  Plus there's a terrorist threat that almost spells the end of Castle and Beckett in a thrilling two parter.  These episodes are definitely more serious than the normal episode of the show.

And then there's the case of Beckett's mother.  This unsolved murder has haunted Beckett for years, and she takes some big leaps forward in solving it.  Unfortunately, one of the twists in that case took a not so pleasant turn, one I really feel the writers forced into the story.  It doesn't feel quite believable to me, although it's not so unbelievable that it will ruin the series for me going forward.

While Castle and Beckett are the main focus of the show, there are plenty of supporting characters.  At the precinct, there's Captain Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), coroner Lanie (Tamala Jones), and detectives Ryan and Esposito (Seamus Dever and Jon Huertas).  To help flesh out Castle's character, he lives with his mother, aging actress Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan), and his teenage daughter Alexis (Molly C. Quinn).  Everyone in the cast does a great job with their parts.

As so many other shows like to do, this one plays up the will they/won't they between Castle and Beckett.  While I didn't buy any sexual tension between them in season one, I completely buy it now.  I am on board with wanting them to get together, although so far they have found believable reasons for keeping them apart.  Hopefully, that will continue.

Meanwhile, the mysteries are entertaining while I wait for Castle and Beckett to finally give a relationship a try.  Most of the time, they do a good job of confusing me, but then again I'm very easily confused.  Even when I do figure things out early, I still have a lot of fun getting to the end.

And that's where the humor comes in.  Castle is always willing to float some wild theory early in the case, and Beckett's reactions are priceless.  They keep up a pretty good verbal battle of wits, although underneath it, it is obvious they care for and respect each other.  Meanwhile, Ryan and Esposito have a serious man crush on Castle, and their treatment of him is often quite funny.  There's usually a good laugh and a few chuckles in every episode.

The 24 episodes of season 3 are preserved on 5 DVD's in full surround and wide screen.  Extras include an audio commentary, new cast and crew interviews, a couple of featurettes, and the usual deleted scenes and bloopers.

Castle continues to be an entertaining show that serves up a decent mystery with a large helping of fun.  Don't miss your chance to get season 3 to enjoy for years to come.",1432339200,,4058,4.602510460251046

4140629,5,B003L77FYS,"I only stumbled onto Castle during the 4th season.  Luckily there are season sets on DVD which allow me to play catch-up :)  I'm almost done watching Season 3: it is the best yet!! Innovative and intriguing plots, relationship dynamics (mainly Beckett-Castle) are more fully explored, personal histories are revealed like layers of an onion.  THANK GOODNESS it's on dvd.....I would have freaked if I had missed a SECOND of the 2-part episode I watched last night!!",1413676800,,464,5.0
4140630,4,B003L77FYS,"I think this is the season where the show started on the downhill run to All About Beckett and Her Tragic Backstory.  However, we also get the wonderful UFO story, the steampunk story, and the bar.  After this, the storylines with Alexis become more awkward and other issues.  I haven't watched the series for the past couple of years, but the first three seasons are terrific.",1413590400,,377,4.681818181818182

4140960,5,B003L77FYS,"I admit that it was my husband who got me interested in watching season 3 of Castle because this is one of the television shows that he loves (he has multiple seasons 3 and 4 of Castle in his itunes account). Additionally, he has been watching this show since 2009. Anyhow, it is easy to see why he enjoys this show.  The tv show of Castle centers around the story of an author who works closely and gives his best professionally to a detective that he is actually has romantic feelings for. Castle is a popular and successful author who also enjoys helping the detective because many of the cases give him strong material for his books.  He also is shown interacting with both his mother and daughter who he loves very much. There are multiple suspenseful episodes in this season that it is hard for me to choose a favorite. However, one of the episodes that clearly sticks out in my memory is an episode where he is tasked with solving a tricky murder case that involves a celebrated psychic as the victim, especially because the killer was the last person who I would expect to do such a cold blooded act. One of the women who currently star in the Witches of East End series (I believe that it may be Rachel Boston as Ingrid) plays the surviving daughter of the murdered psychic. Another episode that stood out in my mind was that of a murder of a metro worker that also ties into a boys abduction.  What complicates matters is that the parents had divorced and the mother had moved on to a much wealthier man than the father. She is shown scolding at the father while standing next to her new partner (this show definitely also knows how to create heart string pulling drama). The third episode that stands out in my mind is that involving the murder of an attractive male stripper and one of his wealthy older female lovers as a suspect. The stripper was only trying to turn his life around financially when he was murdered. Another episode that stood out to me was the murder of a gifted astrophysicist. Lyle Lovett stars as one of the mysterious government men (possible Men In Black theme) who make a guest appearance. There are many more brilliant episodes to season 3 of Castle, which is a good show to watch for those who are open to watching keep you guessing type of suspense.",1408665600,,2290,4.473684210526316
4140961,5,B003L77FYS,"Always entertaining, this is my current go-to series for relaxing viewing, the television equivalent of comfort food. Having adored Nathan Fillion since his soap days, I looked forward to the premier season, and haven't been let down since. As he notes frequently in the commentaries, the series manages to land wonderful guest actors to glow alongside the marvelous regulars. The writing is clever and satisfying, the cinematography often exceptional for network television, and if anything would ever, ever make me want to visit New York City again, the spirit Castle might just do it, as the city herself is a central character on the show. Altogether terrific!",1408579200,,664,5.214953271028038

4140993,5,B003L77FYS,This is a great series that reminded me of Moonlighting with Bruce Willis. I now own most of the seasons. (I loved the first three seasons of Moonlighting.) The concept of  law enforcement teaming up with a successful crime writer is unique and the scripts are well written. The whole cast is wonderful. It is my favorite series and has a character to love for each generation. One of my favorites was the impromptu singing as they walk down the headquarters aisle. Great voices they should promote more. They also have the dignity to promote romance over blatant sex.,1407715200,,568,4.737373737373737

And since the show is already headed into, I believe its 7th season, many have already formed an opinion on the earlier seasons. So this review is more about the great service from Amazon.com and goHastings. Although the DVD looked in ok shape, many episodes were plagued by skipping chapters. Now I bought it used, so those are the risks. But when I contacted Amazon, i received excellent assistance. They emailed goHastins, whom I purchased it from, and they inturned sent me a first class mailing label with clear instruction on how to return the DVD with a full refund including the original shipping and handling cost. It should also be noted that this is not my first time buying from goHastings, but the first time I needed to return an item (used or new).

4141947,5,B003L77FYS,If you like the previous seasons of Castle you will like season 3. Castle is a police detective drama with the spin of the writer Castle following along with the homicide squad. The homicide squad is not suppose to be dumb and can work without the writer but are better with Castle. The cast is an ensemble that appear to work well.,1382227200,,332,4.370967741935484

Nathan Fillion wouldn't ever have to say a word; his facial expressions say everything. A cliffhanger ending meant I impatiently waited all summer for the fourth season to begin. I'll definitely buy all the seasons of Castle to add to my DVD collection!",1381104000,,393,4.880597014925373

4142075,5,B003L77FYS,"I love the chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic! Beckett is a homicide detective who is being followed around by Castle so he can write his ""Nikki Heat"" books. Beckett's job is a hard one which is made a little easier because Castle is there to help her. He makes her crazy at times but in the end they work together beautifully to solve the murders. He sometimes acts like a 12 year old but Beckett can be counted on to not let him get away with it. Add in Ryan & Esposito as the other half of the homicide team, Castle's mom, Martha & daughter Alexis and you have a cast that really makes ""Castle"" a fun show to watch.",1378684800,,632,4.188524590163935

4142079,5,B003L77FYS,"I've bought the first and second season, and now the third.  I'll keep buying each season as they come out/keep making them.  The stories (where you always forget the details and funny bits from when you watched the episodes the first time) are way more fun when you don't have to wait through a commercial break to see what comes next - even if you've seen it before, but just can't quite remember what comes next or who the killer turns out to be.  Castle and Beckett and just always so great to watch - their dynamic, but also alongside and with Esposito and Ryan.  Many a fun night in our house is spent watching Castle DVD's and this season is no exception.",1377907200,,662,4.357723577235772

4142081,5,B003L77FYS,"I had never watched Castle regularly as it was broadcast.  I came into it late and had a little trouble catching on.  So when Castle seasons became available on Amazon instant videos, I started with the very beginning.  I have been watching the episodes in chronological order and find it thoroughly delightful.  Yes, someone always gets killed, but the search for the perpetrator is always quite intreguieing and the victim is never a person they allow the viewer to become attached to.  There is always just a hint of romance on the side, and the character, Rick Castle, is multideminsional.  He has quite a dry sense of humor with intelligence and warmth mixed in.  I am really enjoying it.",1377561600,,693,4.773109243697479

4142145,5,B003L77FYS,Great chemistry between all of the characters and actors.  Best show I have watched in a long time.  Topics are unique at times and different from just the same o same. I love how the writers have gradually built the love relationship between Beckett and Castle.  I also love seeing the old and well known actors that come on the show to portray Castle's writing buddies or some of Beckett's partners.  Great writing team and excellent story lines.  Overall rating of 5 or if I could give it a 10 I would.  Keep up the great work.,1376956800,,530,4.412371134020619

4142275,4,B003L77FYS,"This season had good balance of murder mysteries, personality conflicts and Castle struggles with daughter and mother.

If you haven't watched season 1 or season 2 you need to watch them first to see character development.

*possible spoilers*
During this season it starts off shaky as castle hasn't bothered to call anyone down at the station since returning to town. While he does go back to help them his ex is still in his life and surprise people in beckett's life pop up. Yet through out the season there are moments wher the two of them are being directed to the other.

4142672,1,B003L77FYS,"Our family just loves ""Castle"" and we enjoy, periodically, viewing older shows, either on reruns or on DVD.  We have bought the first 4 complete seasons on DVD.  When we got to the third disc of the third season, it wouldn't play; all others were just fine.  I wrote Amazon, followed all their guidelines, but -- to date -- got no meaningful answer.  This review is my first attempt to move somebody to do something by going public.  I can't believe that such a large, reputable company shafted me.

However, back to the show.  It's amazingly good.  The writing is excellent, you almost see/hear the writers having a good time, giving the characters their lines.  The characters, almost from the first show, are very well-crafted and human, not super-human.  The plots are a little stretched here and there to fit the story into the show's premise, but it's all done in good spirit and a sense of humor.  Highly recommended, in spite of Amazon's behavior.",1370390400,,955,4.7272727272727275

4142748,4,B003L77FYS,"It should be a 5*, but some episodes were too visually gory. I like the interplay between the characters, and the romantic tension in the midst of the platonic relationship between the two protagonists. That has changed in Season 3 - for the worse.
It could be improved if Castle were not a stereotypical adolescent when it comes to relationships to attractive females - out only for the fleeting act he can entice, rather than the meaningfulness of shared values and interests that the mature man holds out for. It could also be improved with less weirdness in the cases that was exacerbated in this third season. There is enough in the normal realm of violence of humans, without concocting the unreal with which no normal person can identify.",1369785600,,745,4.782945736434108

They came packaged and looking great, but when I got to the 5th and last disk of the set it would not play.  Not on my laptop, nor the dvd player to my tv and not on the dvd at my parent's house either.  I once got it to play on my mom's desktop, but only once.  Since then, it doesn't play at all.  Tonite I happened to be working on something and wanted some background sound to drown out other noises, put in the 1st desk of the set... would not play.  Tried the second disk, it skipped and jumped and stalled so much I got annoyed and took it out. So much for background noise while I worked.  Now, I'm going to have to repurchase the set from another seller just so that I can still have all the seasons on dvd.  I paid $20 for it but will now have to pay another $20 because it has stopped working.  The disks are clean, not scratched up, but still does not play.

4143078,5,B003L77FYS,"This is quite possibly one of the best seasons of the show although S5 may definitely eclipse it - have to re-watch to give my final verdict. First ep of this season is brilliant and the rest of the season is pretty amazing. The performances by Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion, and their incredible chemistry really make this very worthwhile, but the cast of supporting characters in the show are just as amazingly talented and contribute to making this one of the best crime dramas that has a little of everything mixed in, and is decidedly not formulaic. Andrew W. Marlowe and company know a thing or two about how to create a hit and keep it relevant. When you see the end of S3, you will of course immediately need to see S4. Having rewatched all seasons (except the current one) in their entirety several times, I have to admit, the episodes never get old or stale.

Always based upon a murder, I do try to guess who did it and why; but to me the entertainment comes from watching the characters interact. Beckett & Castle are priceless and their work together contributes to the show's success. The writters have done a fantastic job and their imaginations are beyond expectation.

The energy never slows down, gets boring, or any other negative.  It is all high energy and snappy dialog, and lots of FUN!  I have reviewed Season One and Two, and this Season just keeps improving on the ideas that Andrew W. Marlowe originated.  You will note that I mentioned FUN on more than one occasion.  Humor is one of the main ingredients, and all the characters get in the act.  From the Captain congratulating the crew on a case well solved, and then adding ""You too, Beckett!"" to a startled Kate, and then saying ""Just pullin' your chain...""  The characters continue to reveal things that tie more and more events together, making for a wonderful guessing game of what will happen next.

4143228,5,B003L77FYS,"Castle is just a fun show.  After watching Serenity and Firefly, I loved seeing all the mentions of those shows in this one, and all of the characters are likable enough that I enjoy watching this show.  It is still a crime show, so if you're not into those, you won't like this one, but it's different in that it doesn't take itself as seriously.",1365120000,,347,4.323076923076923
4143229,5,B003L77FYS,"By this time, you should have an idea of the format of this thing, Castle mystery writer, has the hots for Beckett, but for whatever reason seems incapable of articulating that.

Front story, the murders are decent, if a bit formulaic;  like a bad poker player, they telegraph the killer in a lot of instances, so it becomes more of ""Okay I know who likely did the dirty deed, now how exactly do they tie into the crime itself?""  Instead of trying to figure out who actually did the crime.

There are a few episodes that are just okay;  They progress the plot and little else.

The back stories... .well, there's a bit of overacting but for the most part there's a goodly amount of interaction and humor done by some excellent actors.

But there are other episodes that are quite entertaining and worth viewing more than once.

At this point this series is my go-to for entertaining episodes

Highly recommended",1365033600,,911,4.608695652173913

Not only are Beckett and Castle back to flirt for another season, but the supporting cast make it all the more while to watch. Plots are unique and yet comic relief is interspersed at just the right moments.

I can't stand most shows like this, just too repetitive, and every single one of them (ncis - law and order) is so close in both form and content if you've seen one then you've seen em all.

Castle is a program that my husband and I watch, and even if we catch a rerun, we watch it over as if it were a new show.  Yes, we know the ending, but it doesn't really matter to us.  I purchased season 1-4 and when 5 is over, that will be ordered too.  This video will stay on our shelf for a long , long time and will be watched over and again.",1362960000,,421,3.8045977011494254

4143498,5,B003L77FYS,"If you like shows like NCIS, Bones, Law and Order, you will probably love Castle.

Just as well written as the others, but in a lighter style-no 'the world is going to end because of this terrorist' NCIS like stories.

If you have never seen Castle, The lead is played by Kate Beckett, a (the) top NYPD homicide detective.  She gets paired with Rick Castle, an author of murder mysteries, like James Patterson (who makes occasional guest appearances playing himself) who gets a permanent 'ride along' gig with Beckett, courtesy of Castle's friendship with the Mayor (they play cards weekly). Turns out, Castle is actually good at solving murders, especially odd ones. And of course, just like Bones, a love interest develops between Rick and Kate.

They keep the series light, mostly with Castle doing goofy things, things that only he could get away with, because a) he is a writer, not a pro, and b) because he is one of the mayor's best friends. Things like getting his own Kevlar vest, with WRITER on it, or Castle installing an Espresso machine in the precinct, because he hates their coffee.

All-in-all, a nice enjoyable series.",1362182400,,1135,4.8

Seasons 1-3 all excellent cop/mystery TV with the same sort of humor and interaction you get from Bones, but with slightly realer characters. All the background characters are as compelling and likeable as the leads too, even if they only exist to spout exposition. Great show. People who liked Bones should also enjoy this show. It has similarities and the same sort of approach and weight. And it has Nathan Fillion. ""nuff said.",1360454400,,601,4.788461538461538

My favorites are seasons three and four. This is classified as a crime drama, but, with the bit of humor and the quirky characters, it makes ther stories a little lighter than a 'regular' cop show, without being offensive or insensitive. There are some episodes that are more serious and a bit darker, but I enjoyed all quite a lot. The acting is great, as well as the writing.

The chemistry between Richard Castle and Kate Beckett would keep me tuning in every week even if I did not love the rest of it so much, but I do.  With so many mediocre shows on TV these days, this one is the bright star.  Castle has found its perfect formula and has not tried to mess it up as so many sitcoms do.  One of the most entertaining and memorable shows in years, it's always a bit of rascally fun thanks to Castle's irrepressible sense of humor.",1356307200,,571,4.461538461538462

4144216,4,B003L77FYS,"It is unique yet his input to the unit always seems logical but sometimes not so helpful.  Castle's observations as a writer at almost every crime seen has a tendency to cause Beckett to automaticaly become defensive of the units observations and input as officers against writer.  No conflict between the unit and Castle is ever displayed until Castle talks Beckett into a line of investigation that not only seems rational, but attainable, that is until Beckett and Castle windup in a situation which is so far to the extreme as to present harm or even death to both of them.",1354924800,,577,4.702970297029703

The chemistry between Castle and Becket is amazing. Some drifts, fights, and close calls with death really make the two of them look closely at what they are willing to do for one another. Not to mention, this season ends with a BANG! I had to order season four as soon as this one was done.

Slight spoiler: Honestly, I love that the two main characters don't actually get a chance to fall for each other. From past experiences, whenever the main guy and girl of a show finally get together, the show ends. Everyone likes the tension, not the romance.",1348012800,,723,4.127659574468085

EACH disk has some type of Bonus Features, and the fifth one has the most.  I won't add anything about the series quality, because I'm sure you, the reader of this review, already know how good it is.  Let's just say that it's very well done, with subtitles in various languages, close-captioning and English soundtrack.  The video quality is quite satisfactory, and so are the extras (like deleted scenes and bloopers, besides featurettes and commentaries).  In short, it's worth buying.",1345248000,,645,4.827272727272727

In the episode ""Punked"", Castle introduces it's audience to the quirky and remarkable world of ""Steampunk""; a ""role play/fantasy"" subculture characterized by exquisitely detailed historic/Victorian costuming and fantastic steam-based technology drawn from the imagination of it's participants.

Along with the beautiful Victorian costuming featured in the Steampunk scene, an amazing ""steam-powered"" mechanical arm makes it's debut;
Castle wears and plays with it with great humor! Kudos to my ex husband (Thomas Willeford of Brute Force Studios) for supplying this remarkable piece of equipment; which stole the show!

JUDGMENT CALL:

Finally, after watching three seasons of wondering if Castle and Beckett will ever get together, perhaps longtime viewers have a glimmer of hope for the fourth season.

For so long, after seeing Beckett and Castle together and having this chemistry but none of them willing to cross the line beyond their professional working relationship, season three of ""Castle"" really takes things up a notch by showing the viewers that perhaps these two would be good together.

Granted, like the previous two seasons, the writers are not going to easily make that happen.  And I don't blame them.

Back in the 1980's, when ABC had the hit investigative series ""Moonlighting"" with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd.  The writers kept these two apart for so long despite the chemistry and sexual tension of the characters and once they got together, it was the final nail in the coffin for the series and from that moment on, the two as a pair brought the downfall of the series.

So, sometimes its not a good thing to push relationships but the writers have done a great job of holding things off and building that chemistry.  Do viewers want to see Beckett and Castle together?  Or to continue this built-up sexual tension for between these characters for another season.

But the season finale makes you wonder how things will be in season four between these two.

Now, possibly the best thing going for season three is the fact that we learn that the murder of Detective Beckett's mother is much bigger than she can ever realize.  In fact, as a viewer, I was even surprised to see how deep this storyline has gotten and I do like how things have gotten progressively bigger each season with this storyline and in this case, possibly quite tragic.  OK, probably not as there is no way Castle is going to die but...Beckett?  Would the writers go that far?  All I can say is that the season finale left me speechless.  Wow!

And last, if there is one thing that ""Castle"" writers have been great, that is giving viewers one hell of a season finale.  And to find out one of the characters of the series has a major secret, suffice to say, I never saw that one coming.  And definitely will have ramifications going into season four.

As for the DVD, ""Castle - The Complete Third Season"" is once again, another solid release.  Like the previous two DVD box sets, this third season also has a good number of special features including an intriguing roundtable discussion, two audio commentary, a featurette about shooting in Hollywood, outtakes, deleted scenes and a music video.

Overall, ""Castle - The Complete Third Season"" features another fun humorous, exciting and explosive season and the writers really stepped up their game with a good balance of plot twists, sexual tension and drama.

Definitely recommended!",1335571200,2,9009,4.843523997370151

I stumbled across Castle by accident on amazon.com.  I am looking forward to season 4 on DVD. My only complaints would be the annoying songs/music (they're shooting for the 18-25 yr old group); a few too many ""artsy"" (annoying) camera angles/shots (again, must be shooting for the 18-25 yr old category); & sometimes a little too graphic on the dead bodies. But I enjoy the stories & the acting, & find it very entertaining. I also enjoyed that season 3 has had several guest stars from my generation, like Jane Seymour.

4144598,5,B003L77FYS,"Have always enjoyed most of the shows, but am getting a little tired that neither of them do not have the guts to tell the other how they feel about the other one.

4144599,4,B003L77FYS,"Season Three tripped up while trying to keep pace with what came before. There are a few episodes that fall in line with any other cop-procedural shows, and it doesn't seem that these (compared to the rest of the series sub-par) had any interest in holding ours. Still, the charm of the show makes you grin and bear it. The other half of the episodes are, as expected, amazing. There are a few that stand out as instant classics... those featuring a 'murdered cop', an alien conspiracy (containing another 'Firefly' reference), the 200 year old bullet and another couple that will doubtlessly remind you why you watch the show.

I truly hope that the producers steer clear of the episodic police trappings and keep focusing on the inter-relationships that make this quirky show worth our time.

The bonus features of this set are on par with the previous season sets, which is to say that it is 'decent'. Gag Reels are always enjoyed, but I'd like to see more commentary. Then again, I'd like to hear M.E. Lainie say something other than ""based on body temp and lividity, I'd guess time of death to be between""....

Down to brass tax - if you're a fan, grab it. If you wanting to try something new, this is worth the while, but be sure to start with the prior two seasons. That way, when this season starts to lag slightly you'll be too invested in the characters to be bothered by it.",1332460800,,1385,4.532

4144645,5,B003L77FYS,"Castle consistently delivers entertaining stories, funny lines and great ensemble cast action.  So what if the costumers put Detective Kate Beckett in high heels no cop would EVER be wearing on the job? So what if its hysterical that the writers think we're going to buy the fact that 1)She kicked a door down and 2)She did it in the aforementioned high heels?  And don't even get me started on her artfully tousled hair/perfect and fairly heavy eye makeup. Its FUN! Period.  In this season a long-running plot point gets a little more resolution, and more than one major character takes a major bullet.  Castle delivers nice full seasons of episodes (other than their first abbreviated season due to the writer's strike) unlike the team over at Bones which seems to have gotten too famous to actually put shows out much to my disappointment.

Nathan usually plays a kind of wise-cracking character and this is no different. The chemistry with the rest of the team is great. We own the 1st 3 seasons as well as having watched them when they came on TV originally. If the series keeps up this way I will be buying the rest of them as well. Looking forward to season 4 on DVD when it comes out. Have been watching Nathan Fillion since 'Two Guys, a Girl & a Pizza Place'. We even saw a live episode being filmed, way back when.

4144718,5,B003L77FYS,"I'm not a cop show lover by any stretch of the imagination.  Seeing the same rehashing of police drama plots over and over again isn't my idea of a great genre; I'd rather be watching sci-fi. So when I purchased the third season of Castle for my wife, I wasn't expecting to sit down and watch any of the episodes with her.

Wrongo.

This is a fantastic show.  I'm not that familiar with the first and second seasons, and beyond being acquanted with Nathan Fillion in his more ubiquitous role as Captain Malcom Reynolds, the other actors and actresses are new faces for me.  But the show is engaging, addicting, as it takes the standard cop show formula and turns it on its head.  Fillion as Castle is great, injecting a dose of humor at the right time here while contributing to the romantic tension between himself and Stana Katic, all the while solving crimes that occasionally provide unexpected twists (Sorry to say, however, that a few of the ""twists"" could be seen a mile away, but that's par for the course).  The supporting cast fills their roles well without overshadowing Castle and Beckett but also remaining visible and significant to the plots.

Most enjoyable, however, are Castle's occasional references to Firefly (Speaking Chinese out of the blue and then referencing ""a great show"" where Castle learned it?  Classic!).  Good to see that Fillion and the show's writers care enough to insert things like that.  It makes the show much better for those of us who remember Fillion in his scifi heyday.  Even if cops and robbers aren't our thing, the reminders of a different universe (or 'Verse to be precise) bring a smile to our faces.

Bottom line, for the cop show lovers, you won't be disappointed, and the rewatch factor according to my wife is quite high, so there's no danger in losing interest after one viewing.  Castle is a must for the armchair sleuths.

I came across Castle by accident and saw it had Nathan Fillion in it, who I liked from Firefly and a few films so that was the main reason I bought the show. And while i'm not that into crime shows I have to admit Castle is really good. The chemistry between the two leads is fun and flirty, okay I'm  not quite sure how many seasons they can do without something happening, but overall it's just a very funny show (with the odd more serious moment as well). And season 3 is no exception like the first two seasons it follows the same formula a murder happens and then our detective and writer get on the case and during the episodes the plot will twist and turn. Most of the time you don't know who the killer is until virtually the end of an episode which is down to some very good script writing.

The second season, however, was disappointing. May be my expectations were set too high.
It had expanded to 24 episodes and the writers clearly were out of ideas. It became predictable and I lost interest.

- Castle: ""So she didn't see that coming.""

After eyeballing the hi-tech crime-solving equipment seen in shows like 24 and BONES, there's a cool, old-school quaintness to Detective Kate Beckett's murder board. To sort of piggyback on that observation, sometimes you can have all the fancy bells and whistles, but if you don't have that core foundation of a good cast with terrific chemistry, then you ain't got diddles. Regarding the palpable heat generated by Stana Katic and the awesomely awesome Nathan Fillion, only Boreanaz and Deschanel have got them beat. And shallow guy that I am, I admit that Stana Katic coming in to Season 3 with longer hair makes her look even more stunning. It's also nice to see her Detective Beckett loosening up and having more fun this season. You can only do ""icy"" so much.

Bestselling mystery novelist Rick Castle must have some kind of pull with New York City's mayor, because he's still going on extended ride alongs with the 12th Precinct, still in the inner circle of the 12th's best homicide detectives, still offering his outside-the-box insights on gruesome murders. Castle's writer's block - which is what led him to his association with NYPD - is long over. Castle has produced two recent best-sellers featuring Nikki Heat, his latest character and based on Detective Kate Beckett. You and me, we know Castle is only sticking around because of Beckett. And, really, with mad respect to Detectives Ryan and Esposito, two fantastic supporting characters, it's Castle and Beckett's interactions that keep me coming back. The homicide cases are occasionally intriguing, but nothing I can't find in other police procedurals. I do like Castle's relationship with his very wise 17-year-old daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn, wonderful). Even if I feel that sometimes, thematically, Castle's domestic complications seem to parallel the murder of the week too often. But Alexis, this season, lands a steady boyfriend, giving Castle a whole new set of headaches.

The humor is great, the banter flows naturally. I love the meta-touches, such as Castle promoting his Nikki Heat books and the Derrick Storm graphic novel (all of which actually now exist) and Castle's poker nights with fellow writers such as Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, and the late Stephen J. Cannell (and I love the touching tribute the show pays to Cannell). And, not to flaunt my nerdiness, but did you also catch Fillion's nod to FIREFLY in the episode ""Close Encounters of the Murderous Kind""?

Mulling over Season 3, stream-of-consciousness style: Feuding pizza shops. Murder on a soap opera set. A treasure hunt solved by MAD magazine. The validation of a medium. There's even a vic what gets killed by a 200-year-old bullet, to which Castle remarks: ""Two hundred year old bullet can only mean one thing... Time traveling killer."" But, as good as those episodes are, they aren't the cream of the crop.

But these are: The cat-and-mouse ""3XK"" episode has Beckett's team tangling with the notorious Triple Killer. ""Nikki Heat"" guest stars Laura Prepon (That '70s Show) as the actress cast in the film role of Nikki Heat, and this fun episode finds her tagging along with Beckett and Castle on a case. In Season 2's ""Sucker Punch,"" Beckett was forced to kill the hitman who had murdered her mother before she could learn who ordered the hit. Season 3's ""Knockdown"" has Beckett following up another lead in her mother's murder. Adrian Pasdar plays a tautly wired Homeland Security agent in a two-parter (""Setup"" & ""Countdown"") which has the team frantically combing New York City for a dirty bomb set to explode in mere hours. ""To Love and Die in L.A."" has Beckett and Castle taking a trip to Los Angeles to conduct an unsanctioned investigation. (We also get a chance to see Stana Katic in swimwear, so there are no losers here.) In the explosive season finale, ""Knockout,"" Beckett makes more headway into the conspiracy behind her mother's murder, but the cost is the gut-wrenching death of a regular supporting character and a suspenseful cliffhanger.

It's no coincidence that these episodes are compelling because they feature a more emotionally-invested cast of characters. And, like all savvy television shows, CASTLE knows how to tease the audience, almost getting the boyish writer and the distant cop together, but then wrenching them apart. You need that element of pining. Season 3 has Castle reuniting with his ex-wife and publicist, while Kate Beckett hooks up with a dashing, motorcycle-riding surgeon. But we realize that these are temporary barriers, and don't pose near the threat to our two leads getting together that Beckett's damaged psyche does. I like the crime-solving bits. But the show's not about that.

Bonus features:

4144936,3,B003L77FYS,"Well, different strokes for different folks, and I'll probably be in the small minority in saying that Castle's third season was something of a disappointment for me.  Not because it was a bad season - far from it - but because it just couldn't match the near-perfection of the first two seasons.  To be fair, the show's producers were faced with a real dilemma after the second season ended...with that sad, poignant moment where Castle left Beckett at the 12th precinct to go off for the summer with his ex-wife, completely unaware that he had finally won Beckett's heart.  Had the show picked up where it left off and brought the couple together, the show might have suffered the ""Moonlighting curse"" and faced an early cancellation.  Fearing this, the writers did very much the opposite and essentially re-booted the Castle/Beckett relationship, taking it - and the viewers - almost back to square one.  Yes, the murder stories were just as good, but they always seemed to be compromised by the now-strange relationship between the crime-solving duo.

By episode 4, Beckett has a new boyfriend.  As the season progressed, he would become noticeably absent, while she would continue to exchange little ""cute moments"" with Castle, usually in the final moments of each episode.  After a while, it became obvious that we were being strung along and that the writers were struggling with where to take the show.  This led to a major, and (to me) unfortunate, change of direction, starting with the two part ""Setup""/""Countdown"" episodes (#'s 16 and 17).  Indeed, ""Countdown"" was the first-ever Castle episode that had me wincing and shaking my head.  For the first time, the show had gone completely over-the-top and into a world of high treason, counter-intelligence and ridiculous save-the-world endings.  Castle could no longer be compared (favorably) to whodunit shows of the past like ""Moonlighting"", ""Hart-to-Hart"" or ""Remington Steele"".  This was Castle as Jack Bauer and ""24"".

Any hope that ""Countdown"" was just a fluke, a misstep from which the show could recover, was shattered in the season finale, ""Knockout"".  Inside of 45 minutes, we see two very unpleasant confrontations (between Castle and Beckett, and between Esposito and Ryan), the corruption and death of one beloved character and the shooting of another.  Like ""Countdown"", the episode plays out as if from a different show, with one implausible scene after another, until a long-awaited profession of love that somehow gets lost amidst all the wreckage.

Without rambling on, I will say in summary that season 3 starts off well, gives us some fun and enjoyable episodes through mid-season, and then goes off the rails near the end.  How each viewer responds to the show's changes and decisions will depend on what they envision this show to be, and to what extent they can suspend their disbelief.  If you loved the first two seasons as much as I did, and wanted to hold on to the old ""Castle"", you may very well share my disappointment with the third season.",1316044800,11,3031,4.990059642147117

In fact, the last few shows of Season 3 don't even have the opening explaining the show's premise that has been used since Season 1.

4144966,5,B003L77FYS,"I've been in love with this show since the day it premiered on ABC.  This isn't your run-of-the-mill cop procedural.  It's full of excitement, drama, mystery, witty banter, comedy, romance, family moments, and all-out fun.  That's not to mention the amazingly talented and well-rounded cast that make it come alive on the screen.  The writing is also top-notch, giving a realistic quality to the characters and helping the show to move smoothly.  That's not to say the show hasn't had misses amongst its hits, especially this season, but as the show has grown and moved along, it has only gotten better.

This season, there was a lot more intensity and suspenseful drama than the first two seasons combined.  Now, while it's always nice to have a light, fluffy episode (e.g. Almost Famous, Close Encounters of the Murderous Kind, and Poof, You're Dead), the action of these more intense, darker ones (e.g. 3XK, Knockdown, Setup/Countdown, Knockout) really picks the show up and shows its full potential.  On top of being ""bigger"", the show has also kicked up its romance factor: Ryan proposing to his girlfriend Jenny in the middle of the precinct, Lanie and Esposito hooking up, Alexis getting a boyfriend, and the ever-growing relationship between Castle and Beckett (even with Beckett seeing someone else).  Perhaps getting viewers used to the idea of romantic relationships for when Caskett becomes a reality?  Just a thought.  Though, those two have matured greatly together over this season, and I personally can't wait to see them as a couple.  They've come so far and, as frustrating as the wait is, the writers have taken great care with getting them to that place together.  This season has truly displayed that.

One thing about this season that stuck out for me was its display of growth in the characters.  There were moments of very raw emotion as well as surprising moves from everyone; Alexis getting into a little trouble, Martha truly showing how wise she is, Ryan and Esposito fighting each other, Montgomery making one of the hardest (and final) decisions of his life, Beckett breaking out of her hard shell and showing her softer side, and Castle finally growing a pair and calling Beckett out on things he's been wanting to for a long time--not to mention owning up to his feelings for her.  It's more of these characters and who they are underneath that we've never seen until now.  It shows their depth and new dimensions to explore for future situations.  This is yet another thing that makes ""Castle"" shine.

In conclusion, and on a lighter, slightly fan-girly note: this season was FREAKING AWESOME!  I'm so excited for season four, and I'll be sure to buy this DVD to add to my collection of the first two seasons.  I could watch these episodes over and over and not get tired of them...really, I could.  So, as far as I'm concerned, this set will be more than worth the money.",1309392000,18,2905,4.838056680161944

4144969,5,B003L77FYS,"""You need to be honest with yourself as to why you are doing this,"" Richard Castle's mother advises and worriedly expresses to her son in ""Knockdown"" an earlier Castle season three episode.  Indeed, while following Detective Kate Beckett, on the trail of her mother's murderer, Rick places himself, in mortal danger...constantly.  Why?

And then Rick confesses to his mother and....himself:  ""It's not about the books anymore."" His love for Kate is engraved on his face.

Throughout season one and two the storyline establishes a lovers' dance between Kate and Rick, with the roguish playboy's attempts at befuddling, wooing and softening the troubled, complex and annoyed Beckett. With wit and a sense of the ridiculous, Rick brings fun to Kate's life and makes her feel.  But so much more happens.  The man who gets by on his charm and ""not a little talent"" transforms himself along the way because of Kate's integrity and tenacity.

Season three had its charms, and I truly hated to see it end. Now I eagerly await the video and the start of a new season.  All of the characters are so strong, and the chemistry between the two leads is so palpable, the viewer is ensnared into this world.  It is amazing the power of fiction, of this television show to enthrall and involve, so much so that the faithful audience constantly roots for Kate and Rick to recognize the love they share...the heartbreaking love everyone else sees.

In ""Knockdown"" Kate tells Rick to go home.  She tells him, ""It is not his fight.""  She begs the question, ""Why do you keep coming back?""  And the answer is written all over his face as Rick, the writer struggles to find the words, his voice, to tell her, and then breaks off with a joking repartee about being the plucky sidekick.  He settles for the partner role when she informs him that the plucky ones get killed.

At the end of ""Knockdown"" she thanks him for having her back and saving her life, for standing up, and Rick responds with one word:  ""Always!""

 ""Knockdown"" has its counterpart in the season three finale...""Knockout.""

In a face -off with Rick, Kate asks him how he feels about her.  Still he cannot say all the right words, but he knows they have kissed and have almost died in each other's arms and have never talked about it.  He rattles her.  And she makes an amazing comment:  ""Being with you is like hanging around with the funniest kid in the school.  And it is not enough.""

Stricken, more aware than ever, Rick cannot convince Kate to stand down; the word quit is not in her vocabulary, even if her life is in the balance.  Captain Montgomery tells her that she gives the dead a voice, but she does not owe the dead her life.  At the funeral Kate voices the captain's words when she says that sometimes, if we are lucky, we find the person who will stand with us.  Then Kate looks at Rick, and in that frozen moment she understands love:  love's actions, love's steadfastness and love's power.  It is etched in Rick's face and reflected in hers.

Finally, in the last scene, the writer finds the words... his voice.... his words of love.

..........continued ....September 2, 2011

It has been three months since my Castle season three review (above), and two years since I first reviewed season one.  No doubt I love the show, Kate and Rick, but I've come to some new revelations regarding Kate's comment on her ""hanging around with the school's funniest kid, and it is not enough.""  Her attack has always disturbed me. What more does she want? What is not enough? And I consider:  What do you do when everything is not enough?

In Countdown Rick holds Kate dearly, protecting her as they both nearly freeze to death in each other's arms; later he defuses the bomb, saving the city from destruction. This man is no longer the immature playboy or ""nine year old on a sugar rush.""  And Kate knows this as she watches Rick's every move with pride and love. Still she will not share any private time with him to decompress after a shattering day; she allows Rick to walk away, dejected and clearly alone while she embraces Josh.

Rick has saved her life in countless battles, going through every door with her as her partner, usually unarmed.  She turns to Rick, always.  He welcomes her into his home with generous, open arms.  To the ex -cop Raglan, she identifies Rick as someone she trusts.  Where are the other men in her life? Faithfully, Rick measures up and lifts her sinking spirits with supporting words, with a joke, anything to ease her troubled mind and soul. He listens to her pour out her heart's desire, often clumsily, for surely she is aware that he loves her.  Everyone has told her so.  In sync with him in all areas, she knows her heart would break without him near.

No price is too dear for Rick to pay as he loyally watches over her safety.  He cannot stop himself from giving her gifts of love and thoughtfulness...her father's watch,and the Temptation Lane, signed, cast picture, knowing that these gifts connect to her childhood. When Kate reminds him that he cannot stay out of her personal life after he gifts her with a memorial to her mother, Rick's face crumbles until she thanks him.  Of course he cannot stay out of her life; he wants to be a part of it.  Rick is a happy soul who often says ""until tomorrow,"" because that adieu is more hopeful.  He lifts her heart and soul and she knows it.  She has said that she believes in Richard Castle. He is enough.

In the finale Kate tells Rick they are over, but the captain enlists Rick to help him save Kate's life.  Lovingly, Rick over-powers and holds a grief -stricken Kate, away from the battle which leaves her captain dying.  In this poignant scene, Rick tenderly consoles Kate, stroking her hair, touching her face, holding her back, while telling her how sorry he is.  She cries out his name and strokes his face; does she comprehend? When she looks at Rick as she eulogizes the captain, she seems at peace with Rick's love.  But is it enough, now?

I truly love, respect and support Kate, and these words are hard to say.  But right now she is not enough.  For so many reasons, she clings safely to a man she does not love, afraid to be with someone real. I didn't think I could ever say this because Kate is a strong dose of reality, and Rick, well, Rick is magic.

As for the next season, Season 4,  I realize Castle cannot continue on the same note we have all come to love, given all of the changes taking place on the show, and many of us will be concerned for our favorite lovers, wanting so desperately for them to be together.

But in truth, every character needs to progress and grow. Surely new obstacles will provide conflict and tension, challenging the entire cast.  Indeed, Rick must deal with Kate's fears, Alexis' concern, his own guilt, a new captain's disregard and perhaps the case papers Capt. Montgomery mailed in the finale.  Kate must come to know herself better, work to heal herself, and recover from her physical and psychological wounds, both recent and deeply lodged.

If she sees competition for Rick's attention or someone else in her place, she will have to share more of herself, let others in, and fight for Rick's love.  She has taken him for granted; she wants him boxed into the small space she allows...on her terms.  But Rick is too real (a role reversal for sure) and demands more. Rick now knows (for his everything is not enough), that to win Kate, to gain her love, to hold her, as he so wants to do, he must first let her go.

PS...the Castle lover in me must say:  Let her go, Rick, but just a little bit, for we love her, too.

...continued September 28, 2011...""RISE,"" RENEW, RECONCILE AND REDEEM...MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR NOW

Rick and Kate's dilemma still comes back to what do you do when everything is not enough.  In 3x24 ""Knockout,"" Kate tells Rick that hanging around with the school's funniest kid is not enough.  But thankfully that equation has changed in the new season; amidst the uncertainty, hope and love prevail.

Poignantly titled ""Rise,"" the Castle Season 4 premier is imbued with renewed promise, reconciliation and a chance for redemption as Kate and Rick struggle to find a new dynamic, a new relationship between them, granted, not built on total honesty, but always built on love.

I can understand why Kate does not admit to hearing Rick's profession of his need and love for her. Acknowledging it at this time would change everything between them and possibly jeopardize their chances with each other, especially their friendship which she has always needed.

Momentarily dazed near her, Rick lies to Kate when he tells her why he is staring at her, saying that he didn't think he would see her again.  He stares at her because he is overwhelmed with his love for her. Apparently he and Alexis have a running dialogue about Rick's ""tell"" which indicates he is lying or bluffing at poker; his nose twitches.  The camera certainly zeroes in on Rick's nose twitch as he speaks, standing at the foot of Kate's bed.  With the many close ups of this man available, I have never seen this.

Next, seated by Kate's side, nervous before her, Rick is ready to own his words and to tell her again of his feelings and his love for her, until she tells him she doesn't remember anything and that some things are best not remembered.  It is heartbreaking to see Rick's sad eyes, his swallowing, his hesitancy, his dejection, the rejection.  Seeing him cut off, adrift, is painful to watch.

Yes, Kate needed space, but he needed her.  Cut off from her for three months, Rick needed contact with her to heal from the horror and trauma of her near death.  Later, in the book-signing/swing-set scene, everything she says is pointed, sub-text, revealing her love for him.  She is trying.  Rick is a forgiving person, in love.  Studying his face, Kate wills him to get it. And he does.

With the echoes of ""Knockout"" still in my mind, I think of the last time Rick tried to tell Kate to walk away, that she wasn't fine, and then...their breakup.  Now, once again, his emotions, his hope, his love play upon his face, along with the trepidation that she will not listen.  He must convince her to redirect herself and save herself from the edge of destruction, and from those who would kill her, knowing that shelving her mother's case, even for a while, denies their love a chance to thrive.

Thus Rick's eyes search her face; his voice, hushed, and sometimes breaking, tells of his passion, of his desperation to make her understand. She is so fragile and stressed, he fears to hurt her further. With hope, and awareness, Rick asks her ""to give it time; they will figure it out together...just not today.""

Adding to Rick's heartfelt entreaty, and unbeknownst to him, is Kate's truth:  she did hear him pray for her life, plead for her to stay with him, proclaim his need for her and profess his love for her. Perhaps it is her secret knowledge of the depth of his love that grants her the peace, the honesty to listen to him and to acquiesce.

He promises her his help and a solution. Responding to her fear that she will not know who she is if she doesn't find an answer immediately, Rick gives her an incredible gift with his words:  ""You are who you always were.""  And so in tune with her, Rick states what she needs to hear.  Kate still ""honors the victims"" with compassion and solace as she has always done.  She can get her bearings by ""not letting them rob her of her life.""

Not their usual way of talking, this is evident in this interaction, the most powerful scene of all, even considering the other emotionally-charged exchanges. For Rick has her survival riding on her accepting his guidance and not blasting him out of the water.  Far more than any words, Kate's acceptance of Rick's advice speaks volumes to her trust in him, her need for him and for healing.

 This time she listens to him.

Consequently Rick is able to redirect the chaos in Kate's soul, saving her sanity and selflessly delaying his chances with her, getting her involved with another case and supporting her through a stand-off with a killer, thus confirming his own role as partner and equal.

Later Rick asks Kate for her thoughts on the day, and she says, ""It's not enough.  But it is enough for now.""  It is a start.  Smiling, Rick reminds Kate that the ""wall inside won't be there forever."" Significantly, as Kate turns and walks away, somewhat uplifted, Rick's face reveals his turmoil.  He is playing all sides against the middle, fearing the outcome, the loss.  Right or wrong, Rick is deathly afraid with Kate's life in the balance; he will bear the pain and the fall-out because he can not bear to ""lose her again.""

At home Rick must address his daughter's reprimand that he grow up.  Taking responsibility for the situation, Rick tells Alexis he must be there for Kate.  The voice of his conscience, Alexis asks her dad two crucial questions:

""Does she make you happy?""

""Yes, she does."" Rick replies.

""Is it enough?"" Alexis asks.

""It is enough for now.""

And so it is.",1307145600,16,13066,4.588260681916271
4144970,1,B003L77FYS,"The series itself is marvellous. But I sharply criticize the DVDs of the second and now also the third series, as the subtitles are only in Spanish an French. Is this a new policy to avoid orders from Europe?",1306972800,11,208,4.358974358974359
4144971,5,B003L77FYS,"OK, please don't misunderstand me: I absolutely LOVE the ""Castle"" series. But love doesn't have to be blind, and being completely loyal doesn't mean you can't discuss imperfections of the ones you love, right? So let me start by saying that ""Castle"" has brilliant writers, great plots and plot twists, murder-mystery suspense and action, clever wit and amusing humor, intimate moments, touching pathos, attractive and lovable primary characters and chilling villains, a wonderful cast of very talented actors, great directing and editing, colorful framing shots of New York City and inspired musical soundtracks. In sum, ""Castle"" is, by far, my favorite show on TV. BUT as much as I love this show, I'm sorry to say that I sometimes felt disappointed by some of the episodes in season three. Seasons one and two felt consistently stimulating and satisfying to me, in nearly every episode and in nearly every way. But to my sensibility, while season three achieved more spectacular moments, it also suffered from more disappointing aspects. First, in season three, the writing of the stories and the dialogues was sometimes uneven. At times the writing was MAGNIFICENT (like in the season three finale), but many other episodes were not as clever, intriguing, amusing, or touching as  the episodes mostly were in seasons one and two. The primary and secondary actors are still delightfully talented, but without the best writing, the actors cannot shine to their fullest abilities. Second, the producers and writers made the debatable decision to make the relationship between Rick and Kate suffer a major setback and take a long detour. While there may be dramatic (and financial) reasons to extend the show in this way, it felt contrived and frustrating to me. For example, at the end of season two, at the very moment that Kate is apparently about to tell Rick that she loves him and wants to have a romantic relationship with him, the writers have Rick suddenly reconciling with his ex-wife and going away with her to the Hamptons for the summer. And worse, the writers make Rick completely obtuse and oblivious to all of the obvious signs of emotional turmoil in Kate, just as she is trying to talk to Rick about her feelings. This major turning point that sets up season three seems very contrived and contradictory because Rick is usually exquisitely observant and insightful about so many details and motives of crimes, and yet here (and elsewhere) he fails to observe and understand the emotions, desires, and needs of Kate. The writers (whom I deeply appreciate) repeatedly do this to Rick and Kate (and to us, the fans) at the most important romantic moments, like when Kate aches for Rick to tell her that he loves her, when she longs to hear that he wants a romantic relationship with her, and when the big lovable dope repeatedly should just kiss her! Similarly, I think it is very unrealistic that two strong-willed, highly intelligent and articulate characters like Rick and Kate have never (after three years now!) had a self-revealing, heartfelt conversation about how they feel about each other and whether they both want a romantic relationship together. This three-year failure to talk heart-to-heart would never happen in real life. And after the first two seasons, as the love between Rick and Kate intensified to the point of breaking through their insecurities and fears of rejection, in season three the producers and writers made Rick and Kate pull way back from each other emotionally and relate to each other often as ""just friends"" and ""professional partners"". I felt frustrated and less interested when their relationship became more disengaged. Third, all of the secondary characters (who were given more lines and better lines and a lot more time onscreen in seasons one and two) got neglected and excluded too often in season three. This decision hurt the show's quality because all of the secondary characters act very well and really add depth to the show (and add enjoyment for the audience) when they are given a chance to participate more in the dialogues and stories.

Back to the positive side of season three: it's a pleasure to see Kate's vulnerable and self-protective character grow psychologically and open up interpersonally -- often due to her interactions with Rick and her deepening feelings for Rick. And season three did provide several intense and touching experiences between Rick and Kate, and with Ryan and Esposito, and with Captain Montgomery in the season finale. The finale was AWESOME and actually exceeded the high quality of seasons one and two. The confrontation of feelings between Rick and Kate was raw and honest, and the final scene between Rick and Kate was especially poignant. At long last, Rick finally tells Kate that he loves her -- under extreme circumstances that are desperate and life-threatening. BRAVO! I just hope that in season four the producers and writers will finally allow the characters of Rick and Kate to have a full and satisfying romantic relationship together. Enough already with the frustrating dragging out and postponing of the love we all want to see fulfilled! Let Rick and Kate be happy in a loving romantic relationship with each other. And let me and millions of us fans be happy for them. (Ha! It's funny how emotionally involved I feel toward these make-believe characters.) So let's see ""Castle"" portray and explore a mature and deeply loving relationship between Rick's and Kate's characters. Doing so should enhance the show and advance the story, not harm or end it. There are still countless ways to make Rick's and Kate's romantic relationship have dramatic challenges and interesting developments, and touching, profound, bonding experiences. The keys to keeping ""Castle"" successful rest in choosing the smartest direction for the overall story, and then investing enough money and talent in the writing of each episode. If the direction of the overall story is satisfying to the viewers, and if the writing of each episode is consistently suspenseful, insightful, amusing, and poignant (which is difficult to maintain at the highest level), the actors, directors, and production staff have proven that they are immensely capable of bringing the writing and the stories to life in a thoroughly enjoyable way. So best wishes to season four! May ""Castle"" achieve more consistently the best writing of the first three seasons -- and explore even higher and deeper realms of life and love!

UPDATE on June 10, 2011: I've changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars because the more I review past episodes and think through the evidence, the more I think that Rick's and Kate's three-year inability to tell each other ""I love you"" and to at least TRY to love each other in a romantic relationship may NOT be due to the writers using the old formula of keeping our hero and heroine ""in-love-but-apart"" to create tension and interest in the audience. Instead, Rick's and Kate's three-year inability may be a dramatic reflection of their life experiences, fears of being hurt in a romantic relationship, and psychological and behavioral defenses. If anyone is interested in my evolving thinking along these lines, please read my two comments below the review by ""Trueheart."" I welcome your comments about my theory (and your own theories) about this three-year difficulty by Rick and Kate. Cheers.

UPDATE on October 9, 2011: I just watched all 22 episodes of Castle Season Three on DVD over the past week and it confirmed some of my views, but it also changed others. Changes: the time devoted to the secondary characters in Season Three (and the actors' performances) are excellent. I don't remember why I originally felt that there was less time devoted to the secondary characters in Season Three.  I guess it was because of one or two episodes where the story focuses more on Castle and Beckett. Also, the writing quality throughout Season Three was consistently superb, and in the season finale, it was absolutely magnificent. Confirmations: the writers keep having Rick ""choke"" and ""screw up"" when it comes to expressing his love and desires to Kate. After three seasons (and now into the fourth season), the writers still have not explained why Rick consistently fails to speak and act well romantically when it comes to Kate. After all, Rick is a fluent writer of over 20 best-selling novels; he is extremely observant, quick-witted, and articulate in person; he has been married three times; and he has charmed many women, in and out of bed. So why is Rick so unable to talk with (or kiss) Kate?

Here are some of the many examples of Rick's romantic malfunctioning: In the ""plucky sidekick"" episode, Kate asks Rick emphatically ""So, why do you keep coming back, Rick?"" It's a real moment-of-truth and a golden opportunity for Rick to tell Kate that he loves her and wants to be with her in a committed romantic relationship. Rick hesitates, fails to tell her he loves her, and evades the question. In the episode ""To Live and Die in L.A."", Rick tells Kate that he admires her strength and her heart, and tells her that she's ""hot,"" whereupon Kate tells Rick that ""You're not so bad yourself."" For once, Kate looks imminently receptive for Rick to kiss her. But Rick fails to kiss her, and hesitates for so long that Kate becomes self-conscious and uncomfortable, and therefore excuses herself and leaves. In the season finale, when it becomes clear that Kate is a target for murder, Rick goes to Kate's home to ask her to ""walk away"" from trying to capture or kill the murderers of her mother -- so that Kate might save her own life. We expect Rick to understand Kate's character and psychology, to have thought through ahead of time the best way to persuade Kate, and to talk with Kate in a sensitive, empathic, supportive manner. Rick starts out well, but then loses his focus and his temper. He fails in several ways: when Kate says ""Is that what we are?"", she is clearly challenging Rick to finally tell her that he loves her and wants her romantically. But again, Rick fails to say this essential truth. (Why?) Instead of remaining empathic and sympathetic to Kate's underlying emotional needs and desires for love and commitment, Rick overreacts to the surface of Kate's anger and fear, gets defensive, loses his temper, and instead of expressing his love and desire for Kate, expresses his frustration with their relationship, and ends by aggressively telling Kate that she is ""afraid"" and  ""hiding in nowhere relationships with men you don't love."" Rick may be accurate in his description, but he is horribly wrong in his manner, timing, and focus. That wasn't what Rick should have told Kate at that moment, it wasn't what Kate needed from Rick at that moment, and it wasn't even what Rick came over to talk with Kate about. And it sure wasn't loving and helpful. Even when Kate forcefully tells Rick that ""You think you know me, but you don't!"" Rick can't or won't stop the tirade he's on, can't stop to ask Kate to help him understand her better, can't get himself on Kate's side at that moment, for both their sakes. Rick has seriously mishandled several steps and several goals of his visit to Kate. (Why?)

In the same episode, Rick tries to express to his mother how he would be utterly devastated if Kate were to be killed, but again the words get caught in his throat. Martha says something like, ""Oh Rick, for someone who is so good with words, you often can't find them at the right time."" Rick chokes on his words and actions, when it comes to Kate romantically. (The writers have gradually revealed why Kate ""is fighting her feelings for Rick"" and is ""hiding in nowhere relationships"", but the writers still need to explain why Rick, who can speak and act so effectively in a range of situations (including life-threatening situations) suddenly fails to speak and act well -- and even speaks and acts poorly -- when it comes to Rick's romantic feelings for Kate. I hope the writers will soon start revealing Rick's previous life experiences and the psychological reasons for his many failures with Kate romantically. And I hope the explanation is a lot more interesting and profound than simply that Rick doesn't want to ruin what he and Kate currently have, and also is so intent on not harming his future chances with Kate romantically that he keeps holding back on taking any chances with her in the present.)

But for all of Rick's inability to tell Kate that he loves her over the first three seasons, Rick breaks through his fears and inhibitions when Kate gets shot and may be dying, in the final moments of Season Three. Twice, Rick tells Kate that he loves her. That's a huge breakthrough and I'm very glad for it. But we've now seen three episodes of Season Four and Rick is still not talking with Kate about his love for her and his desire to start a romantic relationship with her. Personally, I think the writers need to have Rick and Kate start talking about their love for each other, and then start acting on their love for each other. Either that or start having episodes that explain in much more detail why Rick and Kate are not yet able to talk and act on their love for each other. Unless we know more about the reasons for Rick's and Kate's romantic dysfunctions, watching two beloved characters be unable to romantically behave normally or happily for three or four years is more frustration than I think is fair to the fans.

I believe that Season 3 is where this show really hit its stride - nearly every episode has the right amount of intrigue, intensity, and humor.  For me, the best episodes of the season were ""3XK"" (episode 6), ""Last Call"" (episode 10), and ""Knockdown"" (episode13).

It's thoroughly entertaining, and definitely worth your time and money.",1305158400,102,576,4.77
4145045,5,B003L77FYS,"This is definitely not my 1st Castle and it certainly will not be the last. I truly love the series and all of its characters.
The story in 'To Love and Die in L.A.' gave a taste of a past show and it kept it in the present so you didn't have to wonder what happened then. It added a new enticement to the older show and kept it neat and added a story to really finish the older show. It was very well written.
Castle and Beckett are still very very close to going to the next romantic level. I hope the writers keep it going up slowly. I love the enticement.
The entire cast are all good actors.",1304467200,3,596,3.975

4145048,5,B003L77FYS,Awesome episode. The actors and writers continue to amaze us every week. The chemistry is electric between Nathan and Stana. This is one amazing show. Stana deserves a Emmy for her role as Detective Kate Beckett. She owns this character and pulls you in with every touching moment. You feel every single emotion that Kate is feeling. Awesome job Stana. Nathan is just adorable and charming as Rick Castle. Awesome job Nathan. What a combination these two are. The entire cast is the BEST on tv. Check out CASTLE.,1299715200,,512,4.764044943820225
4145049,2,B003L77FYS,"Last year you could download amazon videos into your i tunes.  This year, they are making you download their own player, which is horrible.  The downloads take forever, the player doesn't work half the time, and it's one extra app on your machine you don't need.  My advice is wait for the dvd or download single eps from i tunes!",1296259200,,330,4.466666666666667
