5274185,5,B0096RC6Z0,"Too bad this dvd set doesn't come with interviews with the cast ( including Venus ) , cominterry , caricature bios , Q/A on and about Venus Di Milo and advancements for every live kids show that Saban was ever apart of ; like what Filmation did with their dvd releases .",1355529600,,270,4.211538461538462
5274186,5,B0096RC6Z0,I use to watch the show all the time when it was on TV. I was never really happy with the addition of a new turtle she kinda slow down the show connection for me. then I found out that the original creators never made her saban just threw her in as a female counterpart. they felt that the turtles needed a female element to appeal to girls in other words the original creators only made 4 that's how we intended the team to stay saban changed the format. all in all it was a spectacular show but the extra turtle was just way too much trouble.,1348444800,,544,4.093457943925234
5274187,5,B0096RC6Z0,"The conclusion of this short lived but entertaining show is coming soon. I really wish they made a second season so they could have brought April and Casey back, I also think Shredder was suppose to come back as well. I hope one day Venus can come back into the continuity because she did have her own fan base and so many stories could be done if they bring back the female turtle.",1347494400,3,382,4.2465753424657535
5274198,5,B0096RC6Z0,I love the live action series fun if you like the turtles !,1421712000,,59,3.6153846153846154
5274199,4,B0096RC6Z0,"The episodes in Vol. 2 of the series got a little whackier, and the goofy sound effects seemed more pronounced than in the earlier episodes.  But I still had fun watching this.  If you read my review on Vol. 1, you already know this isn't for the purist among the turtle fans.  But for the rest of us geeks, well, what can I say?  It's the turtles, they're still ninjas, they're still teenagers.  Raph & Leo still get into it.  If you haven't watched Vol. 1, you should probably start there to get the bizarre backstory straight.
I still love the Turtles, in any mutation they take - even when they grow over 6 foot tall, become bullet-proof, and carry mega-attitudes.  (You know what I'm talking about.)",1418601600,,704,4.496062992125984
5274200,4,B0096RC6Z0,"It must first be admitted that I'm a die-hard fan of every iteration of the TMNT franchise (though even I am stricken with fits of anxiety over what that executioner of childhood, Michael Bay, will do them). Even so, it must be said that when this show was on, I hated it. More the fool I am! I wish I'd bought one of those Venus de Milo figures now; they're worth big bucks! But as to the series: it is camptacular. The turtle suits are actually pretty impressively made and allow for quite a bit of martial arts mobility, though the seams do occasionally show.

This series is not dark or gritty. It is VERY silly and this point is accentuated by the relentless silly sound effects which punctuate every action on-screen. The series also strangely fits into a turtle continuity, which makes it a bit more interesting as well: the Shredder is dispatched in the first episode, and the writers thankfully felt little need to cram the backstory down our throats. The turtles team up with a lady turtle (yes, probably the single most irritating element of this series) named Venus de Milo to battle a hoard of evil, puppety dragons. In one of my favorite silliness smorgasbords, Raphael is pursued by a bounty hunter who becomes pursued by an escaped circus ape and the whole gang end up pursued by the dragons through an abandoned mansion. Another hilarious bit of camp was delivered when Shredder returns, not as a Japanese warlord, but as a sodden vagrant who sleeps in the park. If this weren't all enough, this volume brings us a crossover episode with Power Rangers in Space! It can be a little too childish for some (it WAS meant for children), but if you love camp like me, you'll be able to look past some of this series's flaws and appreciate it as the gem it is.

There isn't much to be said for the DVD itself: just the episodes with no features, which, for the price, I suppose is good enough.",1398643200,2,1903,4.51304347826087
5274201,5,B0096RC6Z0,"As the final part of the series, This series was very entertaining to watch.  A recommended title for the anyone that liked the 80s live action turtles movies.",1386374400,,159,4.678571428571429
5274202,5,B0096RC6Z0,"...it's a fantastic DVD. Shout! Factory did a perfect job including the extras with Power Rangers In Space.

The image looks wonderful and, considering was a cheap production for Saban at that time, it's a funny new way to watch the turtles. If you watched it on Fox Kids or wherever you did, here is a piece you NEED to get for your collection!",1381968000,,345,4.390625

5274205,4,B0096RC6Z0,"As for the packaging and delivery, everything was fine. It arrived on time and everything was in great condition. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star is the content of the movie itself. My 4 year old daughter loves the Ninja Turtles. She is in one of those phases where this is her favorite thing. She actually likes these newer movies (well, tv shows). I, on the other hand, can't stand them. This is not the fault of the seller though! I am just commenting on the content of the actual show. The masks are wrong, the story line is crap, and it is just too far from the original movies. I am not a fan of this tv show. Again, as far as the seller is concerned, 5 stars! As for the actual tv show, 2 stars. My average equals 4 total stars. (I ordered vol 1 and 2. This comment applies to both.)",1358467200,,806,4.1075949367088604

Think about this series as a comedy series. It's not a continuation of any TMNT series because it's a series all on it's own. It's fun to watch, If you're a hardcore turtle fan then you may want to leave this out of your collection.",1358380800,2,545,4.313725490196078
