8369584,5,B002FY5WBG,"This DVD is fantastic.  Clear instructions and excellent tips and tricks to ensure your weaving experiences succeed!  As I am in England and Navajo weavers are scarce (!), this is like having your own teachers in your own home to help you.  I would thoroughly recommend this DVD.  Thank you, Angie and Susanne.",1442793600,2,310,4.7924528301886795

8369586,5,B002FY5WBG,"I have been trying to learn how to weave for over a year. I have been reading everything I can get my hands on about the subject. I finally found this video and wish that I had come across it sooner. It would have saved me so much time. It really brought clarity to every aspect of weaving. Concepts I never would have grasped from the books I easily understood after watching this video. I highly recommend it. I've never written a review before, but this is something I would like to support. It is a highly valuable resource I would like to see all weavers use.",1318636800,8,564,4.280373831775701
8369587,5,B002FY5WBG,This was the only DVD on Navajo Rug Weaving I could find.  What a great choice it turned out to be.  I love this video.  It is a wonderful training video for anyone (like me) who can not find classes.  It covered every question I had and taught me things I did not even know I should be worrying about.,1295395200,7,302,3.9833333333333334
8369588,5,B002FY5WBG,"I have borrowed this video from the library and must have it. It is the quintessential resource for anyone interested in studying or creating Navajo textiles. From this video we've learned how to build our own loom, prepare the yarn, create, weave and finish the design. These techniques can be applied to more than rugs for a new generation. Angie's instructions are complete and easy to follow. More important, she makes you feel part of the tribe and tradition by teaching through this video in the same way they have taught new generations for hundreds of years.",1290643200,11,566,4.845360824742268
