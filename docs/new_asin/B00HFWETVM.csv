8632553,5,B00HFWETVM,all are good movies well acted the mermaid flick I hunted for and gave up and here it is love it,1507852800,,96,3.619047619047619
8632554,4,B00HFWETVM,"A worthwhile value pack of creature features with Anaconda being an instant cult classic. Dark Water is a worthy watch, a nice little thriller with a bit of drag in its structure, that features a killer croc. Even Red Water is decent action SyFy fare that has sharks amok up a fresh water river inlet. Lou Diamond Phillips elevates this ride. The She Creature copy unfortunately was a lackluster transfer. Its otherwise pretty decent too and features some nice Stan Winston practical effects of a killer mermaid. A solid 4 stars for this package deal. At $5 you cant beat the price.",1483056000,,582,4.715686274509804
8632555,5,B00HFWETVM,"Buying this dvd set is cheaper than just buying Anaconda by itself. Great deal, even though the other 3 movies are not that great. It is a good and cheap way of completing your Anaconda Collection.",1443657600,,197,4.5
