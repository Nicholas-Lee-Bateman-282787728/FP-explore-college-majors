2423100,5,B000BKVLAW,"This is an excellent bio of Redford.  It filled in details that have been missing in other news about his career.
An amazing, energetic, deeply engaging actor/producer/environmental activist.  As even his close friends say, he has much more to offer in the coming years.",1312156800,,270,5.113636363636363
2423101,5,B000BKVLAW,"It was lovely to finally find out more about this man.  He is such a private person and I was suprised how much of his life was exposed to the public on this DVD. I enjoyed reminising over all his previous films.
He also contributes greatly to the movie industry, helping newcomers to realise their dreams with the annual Sundance Film Festival. In my opinion, this purchase, was money well spent. I am from Australia and have my own private DVD collection of his films. So, for me, this was the icing on the cake.
Also I have the Biography of his great friend, Paul Newman, that was also purchased through Amazon.",1298937600,,614,4.482142857142857
2423102,5,B000BKVLAW,"This is a treasure!  If you want to know Redford at his best and most vulnerable, this production is a gem!  I've collected his movies, but never ""knew"" him until now, and I like and respect him even more.  He is easy to watch and generously shares his intimate thoughts and perspectives on politics and life.  He is deeply sensitive, intelligent, and passionate about many things, and a gifted movie maker. You will enjoy owning this Biography of such a fine actor, director.  Don't hesitate!",1240876800,3,493,4.752941176470588
2423103,4,B000BKVLAW,"If I remember correctly, the Ancient Greek playwright Euripides had everything.  He was rich, handsome, famous, and lived a long life.  That fact flashed through my mind as I watched this documentary on Robert Redford.  I don't want to diminish the pain he must have felt about the death of his first child or his divorce.  However, he is handsome, famous, a success at most things, a pioneer, an Oscar winner, articulate, and well-loved.  He practically has it all.  If there are deities, they really hooked him up in every department!

This episode of ""Biography"" was 90 minutes, rather than the typical 60.  I wonder if this is a sign that the makers just loved their subject.  Sometimes I got bored hearing, ""first he made this movie, then he made that one.""  However, I was shocked and impressed to learn that he invented the Sundance Film Festival and created the ""Incident at Oglala"" documentary.

The film notes, as many others have, that Redford is yesterday's Brad Pitt.  Just like Pitt, he avoids talking about his good looks.  This biography also made me think he has much in common with Russell Crowe, and possibly Jude Law.  Both Crowe and Redford seem to play many roles that take place in the past.  There were too few shirtless shots of Redford in this work.

My biggest disappointment with this documentary is how they watered down Redford's progressivism.  They call him ""a political activist.""  However, he is a LEFTWING political activist.  He supports environmentalism and indigenous people's rights; he is even chums with former Senator Bill Bradley.  Very briefly, they show Redford calling himself Dan Quayle years after Quayle was no longer in office.  However, back in 1987, it was a huge deal that Quayle was said to be like Redford and Redford openly condemned this comparison, given the men's opposite sides on the political spectrum.  So I really think the biographers were not as truthful as they should have been because they did not want to upset or wanted to appease right-wing viewers and fans.  This felt like a sign of cowardice in stark contrast to the outspoken nature of their subject.",1145404800,12,2126,4.860724233983287
2423104,5,B000BKVLAW,"I just finished viewing this movie and it was fantastic! If you want to know more about Redford's career, I highly recommend this biography. I have followed his movies/career for the past 30 years and was pleased to be able to gain greater insight into his talents as an actor, director, and leader in environmental issues.
This is a jewel of a movie!!!! I think even Redford would be pleased!",1000857600,14,393,4.628571428571429
8088273,5,B000BKVLAW,I'm so pleased I got the DVD. Better than I expected. Had many people telling of his life including Redford himself. Sundance was seen working I didn't expect. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Redford fan.,1517443200,,214,4.512820512820513

8088275,5,B000BKVLAW,"I was somewhat disappointed although I liked the book information. My disappointment is with these authors that love to see their work in print. I do not like details...all I wanted was to learn of his life. Actually very little was known about Redford compared to someone like John  Wayne. He started out wanting to be an artist and spent most of his time going from one location to another to sketch. Just by chance he was introduced to the stage and began acting and his biggest asset was he instinctly knew what was right and what was wrong. He did Barefoot in the Park on stage and many others but because he was doing plays not many people recognized him. He liked it that way. Then they decided to put Barefoot on the screen and he was immediately a success but did not like people recognizing him & invading on his life. He was without a doubt the most handsome actor, beautuful smile and did the ""double take"" better than anyone, Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid was, according to critics, not going to be a success. I myself pay no attention to critics opinions.....they decided to put it out there to the people and it made millions but was only about 6 million to make. He has done many movies since and who would not want to look at that handsome face with blonde hair and blue eyes. He married and had children which he aored. His greateast love was starting SUBDANCE in Utah which is famous now for hopeful actors, directors, etc. After reading the book you understand his personality in movies because he was himself at all times. The Horse Whisperer is one example of what he is really like. Contrary to Paul Newman in his day, Redford will give autographs to anyone because he said the people are the ones who made his successes. (Sorry should be SUNDANCE) . Only a few years ago he was in Omaha quite a long time because his son was getting a transplant. Also noticed in the paper when ""911"" happened he was to be on the flight which crashed in Pennsylvania but finished his work and took a flight the night before. How wonderful for him and his family and many fans. He is involved in too many activities to mention but art was not part of his life although he helped with scenery, etc. I buy books from Amazon because of the main character, I just wish I would know who the writer is & their ways. I did get a DVD from Amazon where Redford is interviewed live and that is worth it , too.",1494892800,,2408,4.363028953229398
8088276,5,B000BKVLAW,"Wonderful! Redford and Newman, just like pb&j!",1486252800,,46,5.714285714285714
8088277,5,B000BKVLAW,"I loved this video, it showed clips from many of his movies and gave a lot of insight into his personality and struggles.  Complex character.",1470787200,,141,4.64
8088278,5,B000BKVLAW,"I have been a Redford fan for a long time. I just realized that he will be 80 this August!! (Gawd, that makes me feel a little old) so I started collecting DVDs of his movies for my private collection and stumbled across this.  It was well worth the time and $ I spent on it and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates Redford.
Yes, he leans to the left (but not as much as many of the Hollywood crowd) and he seems to have some pretty solid family values.  He has contributed to the entertainment field not only with his movies-most of which are simply delightful, but has really stepped up greatly to help newcomers in his Sundance endeavors.  I was watching Downhill Racer recently and also watched the interviews and commentary that came on that disc.  Something jumped out at me in Redford's interview:  He wanted to do that project so badly and worked hard to pull it all together. The studio was dragging their feet and he stated if HE had so much trouble getting support for a worthy project, what must it be like for actors who were relative unknowns? And he said that is when the concept for Sundance came to him.  I think that is just great-it reminds me of the Tim McGraw song ""Humble and Kind"" :
""Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
 When you get where you're goin Don't forget turn back around
 Help the next one in line Always stay humble and kind.""
Robert Redford could be an arrogant, egotistical a** like many successful Hollywood stars- instead after achieving success, he turned around and helped the next ones in line.  That's part of what makes him the awesome man he is!",1463961600,2,1610,4.430508474576271
8088279,5,B000BKVLAW,very well done!!!!,1423526400,,18,5.333333333333333
8088280,2,B000BKVLAW,"Very disappointed  Nothing new.  Biography was a summary of information that I had read previously in various publications.
By the description and other reviews, I was expecting more in depth information.",1418601600,,204,5.548387096774194
8088281,5,B000BKVLAW,"This is a rare gem as far documentaries are concerned. Definitely one of the best ""A&E Biography"" series.
I could not find the DVD where I usually rent movies so resorted to buying it.  Will watch it many more times.",1389657600,,216,4.4
8088282,5,B000BKVLAW,"This is a great way to celebrate this man's career. If you like him, you need to have this. It covers his career as well as some personal moments I didn't know about. I gave it 5 stars because of the subject matter. What can I say? I've always been infatuated with him and he's one of the few actors I have always respected.",1369267200,2,324,4.078125
