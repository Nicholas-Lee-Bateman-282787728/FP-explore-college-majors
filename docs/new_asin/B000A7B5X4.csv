8132360,5,B000A7B5X4,"This is a great work out, and will keep you going for months...work up to the advanced slow...great features include very intuitive skipping funtions easily navigating you through each workout, excercise by excercise rather than buy routine...this is a HUGE help for the beginning stages.  As far as all the DVD's for reformers, and I OWN THEM ALL...this is my go to dvd set.  I hope this helps.",1182038400,3,395,4.794117647058823
