8731128,5,B014KEPJNY,"Sound track was good, I liked the opening and this anime. Its great for people, like me, who haven't touched the series, as sort of a start. If you're looking for every bit of information about tsukihime then play the vn. This is for someone who likes Type-Moon and has money they don't mind spending to expand on their series's. That is all.",1496620800,,342,4.444444444444445
8731129,5,B014KEPJNY,"First of all the ending can not be talked about. There are a lot of one star reviews of this anime. I have finally watched it all ,and I am ready to review the work. The art work I give an A+, 5 stars. The story is weird and hard to figure out, but that winds up being half of the fun A+ 5 stars. I listened in English dubbed Dolby and the voice acting was excellent. A+ 5 stars. The sound track was haunting and beautiful. A+ 5 stars. Good grief! what did you people have up your A--es when you were watching this?! If you hated the ending, and I mean utterly despised it, There was still plenty of merit to this work to pull it up to three stars. As far as the complaint of not being true to the Manga goes, get over it already. If you only watch what is true to the written word or light novel, you need to give up on Anime RIGHT NOW!!!! Do not watch another show you will only be disappointed. If yo like Dance in the Vampire Bund you should like this. This is not JUST like that I will warn you, but you will see similarities. I give it 5 for 5",1470700800,,1049,3.883720930232558
8731130,2,B014KEPJNY,"This series will put you to sleep. It takes to long to get going in its plot, it doesn't accomplish much, and the ending is incredibly unsatisfying. Everyone whispers and mumbles their way through this plot, the characters are not engaging, and the plot feels so simultaneously slow and rushed that the characters aren't given enough to do. This series is very pretty. Most Type Moon stuff is pretty, but this is too boring to be tied to other Type Moon adaptations. Watch Fate/Stay Night or Garden of the Sinners. Avoid this unless you want a 5 hour dose of tranquilizers.",1458345600,,573,4.683168316831683

8731135,1,B014KEPJNY,This anime is just a godawful adaptation. Trust me ive seen this whole thing and it sucks ass. Go read the Visual Novel until Ufotable makes a good adaptation. As for the anime stay as far away as possible from this disrespect to Nasu's name.,1445472000,4,242,4.4
