8560222,1,B00B08YRB4,"It's simply embarrassing when a film-maker who has absolutely nothing to say goes ahead and says it. This is one of the most pointless films I've ever seen. If he has not already done so, Bertolucci needs to quietly retire.",1419206400,,223,4.6
8560223,5,B00B08YRB4,"Set in Italy this film tells the story of Lorenzo (Jacopo Olmo Antinori in his film debut) who is a very introverted fourteen year old, who spends more time listening to music on his headphones, than interacting with classmates, and this includes `The Cure' and `Arcade Fire'. His parents have been sending him to see a psychiatrist in an attempt to get him to start acting `normal'. Then he announces that he is going on the school skiing trip. They are over joyed and give him the money etc. Meanwhile he has decided that he is going to hide out in the building's basement for the entire week.

He uses the money to stock up on all the snacks he is not allowed because they are unhealthy, this includes seven of everything for the seven days, so possibly a bit of obsessive compulsive disorder going on too. All is going to plan until Olivia turns up; this is his estranged half sister. She is addicted to heroine and is fast running out of friends and options. She forces Lorenzo to let her stay and they start a fractious time re connecting as brother and sister.

This is a film from Bernardo Bertolucci, who has been bringing us amazing films for a while now including 'Last Tango in Paris', `The Last Emperor', and `Stealing Beauty'. He has a style that is confident and assured with every shot framed effortlessly to perfection and eliciting sublime performances from his cast; Tea Falco as Olivia is marvellous and you may have seen her in `The Young Montalbano' TV series. This is in Italian with good sub titles and a run of just over an hour and a half. Though unconventional in its plot and setting there is more than enough here for most people to relate to, the feelings of anomie that Lorenzo has and the pains of growing up, rejection and addiction are all dealt with in a realistic and understanding way, a truly great piece of cinema.",1378512000,11,1853,4.528358208955224
