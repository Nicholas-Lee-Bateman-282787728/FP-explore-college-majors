8563910,5,B00B83PJFE,"Really enjoying this show. Sure it is not much like the original Scooby of the 1970s, and just as well. Finally the show has more to offer than slapstick comedy and running around in circles being chased by monsters.. now we get some personal dramas going on
that in some instances continue through the episodes. More variety in the mysteries and great looking animation with plot twists, humour and more. You will still have some episodes you think more of than others, as in any show with multiple episodes. A much better effort than the recent Scooby animated movies, which seemed terrible after watching this series. I admit I am yet to view the second disc but expect the quality to continue. Good price too! Must buy for Scooby fans.",1370563200,,739,4.6923076923076925
