8500988,1,B006MK3EZK,Don't be fooled. This is not a movie. It is one of those pyramid scheme companies telling you why pyramid schemes are great. There is not one even remotely intelligent statement made in this movie. I normally never write reviews. The fact they disguised this as an educational movie bothered me so much I just didn't want anyone else to waste their time or money making the same mistake I did.,1440460800,,393,4.549295774647887
8500989,1,B006MK3EZK,"An infomercial for legal pyramid schemes like amway.  I don't have anything against ""network marketing"" as they call it, but I can't believe I had to buy it to find out what this video was actually about. I thought it would be a documentary about marketing. Instead it was propaganda shot with a home video camera.",1427328000,,314,4.607142857142857

8500991,5,B006MK3EZK,"I don't know what to say, this movie just shows a lot about network marketing. Very informational. The quality is fair.",1392595200,,119,4.714285714285714
