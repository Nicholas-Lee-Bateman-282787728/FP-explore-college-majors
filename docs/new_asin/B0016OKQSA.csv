3162517,5,B0016OKQSA,"I loved this mini-documentary!  I watched it with my AKM while we were both munching on Doritos, when suddenly my AKM jumped up and yelled, ""!  !"" (Look!  It's Mikhail!).  Apparently, an AKS-74 on display in one of the Izhmash museum display cases was an old friend of his.  They came off the production line together, and then served together in Afghanistan.  He told me the story about how they once loved the same Tokarev TT-33 before she betrayed them both.  My AKM escaped; the AKS-74 didn't.  Mikhail was sent back to Russia, reconditioned, and put on display.  My AKM defected.  Turns out the safe house they kept him in while deciding his fate was next to my apartment at the time, and we quickly became friends.  When it was clear that the CIA wasn't going to follow through with asylum we bugged out, changed our names, and made a new life.  But he says that even though it brings back bittersweet memories to see where he was born, and painful emotions when seeing his war buddy on display in a museum, he still regrets nothing.",1425945600,,1039,4.526881720430108
3162518,4,B0016OKQSA,Interesting documentary about the production of the AK series of rifles. It's neat to see the Russian take on the rifle and their opinion on Western rifles.,1425772800,,156,4.814814814814815
3162519,4,B0016OKQSA,"Very interesting and informative look at the history, production, testing, and usage of the AK-47. Also touches on some of the newer models.",1425600000,,140,5.130434782608695
3162520,5,B0016OKQSA,Very Informative.,1414195200,,17,8.0
3162521,5,B0016OKQSA,A fascinating account of the man who invented the AK-47 and the AK-74. This DVD is a rare find about the life and genius of Mikhael Kalishnikov,1359936000,,143,4.333333333333333
3162522,5,B0016OKQSA,"This AK-47 History Channel DVD is well made and presents the history of the AK-47, up to and including the AK-74.  It discusses how Kalashnikov eventually prevailed with his AK (Automatic Kalashnikov) over other Russian automatic machine guns.",1306972800,,243,5.394736842105263
3162523,4,B0016OKQSA,"I sure wish this was longer.  Many facts about the history of assault rifles, the designer and the USSR.  I am sure there is more that could have been included,  maybe there will be a Vol. II.",1289347200,3,192,4.135135135135135
3162544,4,B0016OKQSA,Interesting little video....liked it but for the Russian language.,1465257600,,66,6.444444444444445
3162545,4,B0016OKQSA,Very cool video of the factory complex where they build AK rifles.  In Russian with English subtitles.  Some of the subtitles are hard to read as they are overlaid on the original Russian graphics in the presentation.  If you are a fan of the Kalashnikov rifle this video is worth watching.  I especially enjoyed the testing of the rifles portion.,1465084800,,347,4.733333333333333

3162553,3,B0016OKQSA,"Pretty good for gun enthusiasts and history buffs.  Be advised that this ""movie"" is entirely in Russian with English subtitles, and appears to be part propaganda film and part infomercial about the AK-47 that one might see on a tour of the factory.  The host is an enthusiastic Russian girl who never misses a chance to remind the viewer that theirs is the best combat rifle in the world.  Most widely manufactured?  Yes.  Most widely exported?  Certainly.  Easy to train conscripts with?  Okay.  Best overall?  Debatable.  The AK-47 is a terrific ""spray-and-pray"" rifle that you could probably drive a tank over and it'd still shoot, but accuracy and making a soldier more dangerous on the battlefield are two major factors not addressed in this film.",1463875200,,752,4.936

3162559,3,B0016OKQSA,"Wasn't expecting the entire show to be in Russian. I assumed since the cover photo has an English title that the show would be narrated in English. Oh well, you know what they say about assumptions.",1462492800,,198,4.527777777777778

3162563,4,B0016OKQSA,typical russian commentary with no decent or guilt for marketing  and delivering the weapon responsible for more human death than any other weapon. At the same time it is informative on the desing and evolution of an assume weapons platform. I have several but I prefer the Chinese made as I have found them better made and more acurate .,1461628800,,338,4.633333333333334

3162568,2,B0016OKQSA,"This was a russian propaganda video not a documnetary.  I wanted more about the making and performance of this rifle and less of how russia is such a great thing.

It is in russian and English subtitles.  The subtitles are not up very long.  You should be a fast reader to get everything said.",1461024000,,293,4.37037037037037
3162569,4,B0016OKQSA,"Excellent documentary,spent too much time reading subtitles rather than watching visuals.",1459209600,,89,7.181818181818182
3162570,3,B0016OKQSA,As our tour guide walks us through an arms factory wearing a peace sign on her sweater talking about the motherland I notice a few smiles from the workers and a fine looking weapon they were making. They learned a thing or two about our experiances in Veitnam with the M-16  Wonder how expensive that Rifle would be if it was built in the states. $$,1458086400,,349,4.287878787878788

3162574,5,B0016OKQSA,Nice history stuff and advertisement to sell you an AK47,1457568000,,56,4.7

3162578,3,B0016OKQSA,"Subtitles aren't normally a problem, but I kept having to hit my pause button to read them before moving on.  The film itself was more style than substance.  The main point I got is how many variations of the original product there have been.  There was no political message -- really just a glorification of a widespread weapon that has certainly killed more people around the world than nuclear ones.",1456876800,,402,4.714285714285714
3162579,3,B0016OKQSA,I would give it more but there is nothing new in this video but I enjoyed the narrator wearing a tee with a piece sign good presentation.,1456531200,,137,4.111111111111111

3162583,3,B0016OKQSA,"Narrator talked way too fast. I could barely keep up with the subtitles, and it was difficult to read and watch the movie at the same time. The content was pretty good though. It has a little history, some manufacturing, and testing of the AK rifles. This documentary wants the viewer to believe this is the best gun ever made.",1455235200,,327,4.466666666666667
3162584,5,B0016OKQSA,Very informative from a historical and quality prospective. The hostess for the show was creative and entertaining. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THESE RIFLES GO THROUGH BEFORE THEY ARE RELEASED FOR SALE . WATCH it even if you have no interest in weapons .,1454976000,,245,4.590909090909091
3162585,4,B0016OKQSA,First off the host and narrator of this documentary is easy on the eyes and lends a sultry voice to the whole thing while off camera. There is a clear and ever present sense of the quintessential soviet propaganda to this as well which is kind of amusing to me. However all the general inside information and behind the scenes looks at the original factory and its new and improved steps to the modern era. If your into firearms and especially the AK this will likely be a great program for you.,1454544000,,495,4.391304347826087
3162586,4,B0016OKQSA,Very interesting movie. English subtitles were a little off but still good!,1454544000,,75,5.333333333333333

3162607,1,B0016OKQSA,In Russian with English subtitles which are in white and sometimes hard to see against white backgrounds on the screen.  Largely tours of Kalashnikov factories.

3162613,1,B0016OKQSA,"Propoganda, not a documentary.  There is almost NO information provided regarding the history or design evolution (or lack of it) of the weapon.  The program boasts of the superiority of the design and manufacturing processes over those of the West.  Bull!  There are only 2 reasons why the AK-47 and follow-up AK-74 are the most prolific combat firearms in the world: (1) they are cheap, and (2) the manufacturing tolerances are so loose that you can throw them in a mud puddle and still fire them.  It is not because they are especially accurate or well made.  By the way, the propaganda misleadingly mentions the long corrected problem with the M-16 (originally AR-15 built by Armalite Corp., not Colt) in the early Nam period as though it is still an issue.  The problem was a defective extractor spring, not a moisture or dirt issue as a design flaw.  I have fired many configurations of the M-16 (Armalite, M-16, M-16A1, M-16A2, CAR-15,. . . M-4, etc.) in combat conditions in several different countries with the widest of operating conditions, and the platform is a very good one.  That is not to say that the AK platform is not.  I actually prefer the 7.62x39mm round over the 5.56mm, but that is for its greater impact force.  The issue here isn't whether the AK is a superior weapon as the propaganda claims, because it isn't even close.  Ill take a Heckler & Koch (German) any day for normal combat, and a Lapua (Finnish) .300 Win Mag. for sniping.",1437350400,,1460,4.682352941176471

I'm with most of the other reviewers here. This is Russian propaganda pretending to be a documentary on the AK 47. There isn't much to learn about the rifle here aside from it's most basic history. 2 minutes reading the AK 47 Wikipedia page will tell you everything this documentary does.

Apparently, an AKS-74 on display in one of the Izhmash museum display cases was an old friend of his.  They came off the production line together, and then served together in Afghanistan.  He told me the story about how they once loved the same Tokarev TT-33 before she betrayed them both.  My AKM escaped; the AKS-74 didn't.  Mikhail was sent back to Russia, reconditioned, and put on display.  My AKM defected.  Turns out the safe house they kept him in while deciding his fate was next to my apartment at the time, and we quickly became friends.  When it was clear that the CIA wasn't going to follow through with asylum we bugged out, changed our names, and made a new life.  But he says that even though it brings back bittersweet memories to see where he was born, and painful emotions when seeing his war buddy on display in a museum, he still regrets nothing.",1425945600,,1039,4.526881720430108

Be advised that this ""movie"" is entirely in Russian with English subtitles, and appears to be part propaganda film and part infomercial about the AK-47 that one might see on a tour of the factory.  The host is an enthusiastic Russian girl who never misses a chance to remind the viewer that theirs is the best combat rifle in the world.  Most widely manufactured?  Yes.  Most widely exported?  Certainly.  Easy to train conscripts with?  Okay.  Best overall?  Debatable.  The AK-47 is a terrific ""spray-and-pray"" rifle that you could probably drive a tank over and it'd still shoot, but accuracy and making a soldier more dangerous on the battlefield are two major factors not addressed in this film.",1463875200,,752,4.936

The program boasts of the superiority of the design and manufacturing processes over those of the West.  Bull!  There are only 2 reasons why the AK-47 and follow-up AK-74 are the most prolific combat firearms in the world: (1) they are cheap, and (2) the manufacturing tolerances are so loose that you can throw them in a mud puddle and still fire them.  It is not because they are especially accurate or well made.  By the way, the propaganda misleadingly mentions the long corrected problem with the M-16 (originally AR-15 built by Armalite Corp., not Colt) in the early Nam period as though it is still an issue.  The problem was a defective extractor spring, not a moisture or dirt issue as a design flaw.  I have fired many configurations of the M-16 (Armalite, M-16, M-16A1, M-16A2, CAR-15,. . . M-4, etc.) in combat conditions in several different countries with the widest of operating conditions, and the platform is a very good one.  That is not to say that the AK platform is not.  I actually prefer the 7.62x39mm round over the 5.56mm, but that is for its greater impact force.  The issue here isn't whether the AK is a superior weapon as the propaganda claims, because it isn't even close.  Ill take a Heckler & Koch (German) any day for normal combat, and a Lapua (Finnish) .300 Win Mag. for sniping.",1437350400,,1460,4.682352941176471
