Celia is a normal little girl of the time before computers and color television. As a child of the 50's I can relate. Blood oaths, utilizing your imagination to create fun and scares. However, this movie takes a dark turn when too many tragedies's engulf Celia's life; the death of her beloved Grandmother, and the snatching of her pet rabbit through the authorities (ban on rabbits) and her rabbit's subsequent death. SPOILER: The Uncle is directly blamed by Celia since he was the police officer in charge of the rabbit's confiscation. As such she envisions him as a monster and shoots him to death. Mom becomes aware of what her daughter did but does not disclose it to her husband or to authorities. In the very end, Celia is playing with her friends and plays that they hanging someone and then drops the rope (good thing, her sister was the one being executed).

Her parents, realizing she killed him, come to her support, hide the evidence, the killing attributed to ""unknown,"" and all this is only a part of the story! The script, 1950's historic context, and acting are outstanding.  The real tragedy is that the video has not been formatted for viewing on US DVD quipment.",1311897600,2,634,4.693693693693693
