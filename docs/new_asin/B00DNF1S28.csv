5834799,4,B00DNF1S28,"This is a funny Christmas movie with adult themes.  Wouldn't necessarily show it to children, but adults will get a few laughs from it, and it has its tender moments too.  A keeper for me.",1384646400,,188,4.3428571428571425
5834800,5,B00DNF1S28,"I was actually surprised. I love Christmas movies and it's getting harder to find good ones. I haven't liked any of the new ones they have on Hallmark this year. This one has the same plot as many of the Christmas movies. It should definitely be voted most cheesy ending ever, but it's a good way to veg out and enjoy the season. We've seen it three times so far and will probably watch it again. There was nothing bad and nothing brainy. It truly is just a good veg out movie to relax, watch and enjoy. The actors did a good job - even Joey Lawrence in that all-time cheesy ending. It was nice to see a movie where someone wasn't really in love with someone else, or another guy or girl is in the middle somehow. They hid things from their parents but not from each other and that was nice because it does come out right in the end.",1384300800,,833,4.148148148148148

5834805,5,B00DNF1S28,this movie is cute how they meet and in the end fall in love with each other it is refreshing to see that there are hopeless romantics still around  at my age I still look for this in a relationship call me old fashion but this movie kind of reminds me how it is in arranged marriages some what I did not have that kind of marriage but it is still so close to it and  there are parts in the movie that joey shows us he grew up and wants to be taken seriously no more wo sayings he is a man now I recommend this to any one looking for a cute movie for Christmas I loved it,1377302400,30,571,3.75

It's Hallmark so don't expect a stellar life changing movie but for Hallmark, its one of the better ones. Love MaryLou Henner in it. Funny plot where one is Jewish and one is Catholic.

5835032,4,B00DNF1S28,"Nice change of pace from the typical Hallmark movie.  In this film a commitment-phobic Rob Marino (Joey Lawrence) breaks up with his girlfriend before Thanksgiving, he is criticized by his big Italian family about his inability to keep a relationship through the holidays. Wanting to prove them wrong and fulfill his dying grandmothers (Paula Shaw) wish to see him happy in love, Rob goes online and finds Julie (Emily Hampshire), another single New Yorker whos meddling Jewish mom (Marilu Henner), has driven her to seek a temporary boyfriend. Rob and Julie agree to pose as a couple through the holidays to get their families off their backs. But things get complicated when Robs Catholic clan and Julies Jewish family get involved. With Christmas coming and Hanukkah around the corner, they double their efforts to keep the charade going, only to discover their fake feelings may be a little too real.  Not perfect but worth watching,  Joey Lawrence is miscast.  If can get over his dyed and waed eye brows then you might even love this film.",1471910400,3,1045,4.920454545454546

5835157,4,B00DNF1S28,"This plot has been done many-many times.  Two people, hoping to avoid the unwanted pressure from their family, decide to present their families with a fake loved one.  True, it would be far easier just to tell them the truth, but for the sake of this well-worn plot..............they dont.  Complications arise as they spend a lot of time together fooling total strangers.  Its mostly played for laughs because it is hilarious watching people lie with alarming sincerity.  Yes, the people they're trying desperately to fool are obnoxious and overbearing, so its not such a big deal to lie to them, especially as no one expects to get caught.  Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.

Sheesh.  If they spent half as much effort trying to find a real boyfriend/girlfriend, there wouldnt be any need to lie to anyone!

At least its funny and theres a certain amount of charm involved.  I begrudgingly found myself liking it (entirely against my will!).  So Im keeping it to watch again.",1449187200,,1010,4.780346820809249

5835246,4,B00DNF1S28,"I enjoyed seeing the two main characters surprising themselves as they develop a true affection for each other while they pretend to be each other's love to their respective families.  A few family issues are discussed honestly and openly - those scenes are actually quite affirming and tender without being schmaltzy or out of place in the story or played for laughs.  The characters drink mixed drinks and wine, which may or may not be family-friendly for a viewer.  The two are welcomes to spend the night together in one room by the Catholic mother and she says, ""It's okay, I don't judge"" as the son protests that one room isn't necessary for him and his (pretend) girlfriend.  They end up in the same bedroom, the girl in the bed, the guy on the floor. They have a nice conversation that helps them get to know each other better. Each family celebrates Christmas or Chanukah but accepts a potential son/daughter-in-law from a differing faith with no problem.  This is pretty realistic for many families but it presents the parents as so desperate for their children to be happily married that their religious tenets don't seem very important.",1423008000,,1148,4.807106598984771

I usually like cheesy Christmas movies but this one was pretty terrible and I'm disappointed that a $6 investment will only see $.02 for an Amazon trade-in.

5835360,5,B00DNF1S28,"I picked this up on a whim from our local library expecting a less than stellar movie full of bad acting, cliches, and generally pseudo-holiday cheer. Surprisingly, the movie was much better than anticipated!

The story begins with two thirty-somethings who are single and not really wanting to face the unrelenting barrage of relationship questions from family. To remedy the situation, they find one another via a post on a Craig's list type site. The pair show up to various social functions pretending to be an engaged couple to thwart the advances of others and awkwardness of perceived loneliness by others.

After spending more time together, including an overnight stay in a bedroom, the two strangers become very close and begin to have a difficult time determining pretend from reality. The lies continue to spin out of control until things reach a breaking point and everything starts going south. The pair are left with a difficult decision: go their separate ways and continue with life as they knew it or see if this fake relationship is the real thing.

As I said in the beginning, this movie was a great surprise and much better than many of the higher budget romantic comedies out these days. I enjoyed every minute of it and would gladly watch it a second time (which is rare for me!)",1412640000,,1302,4.803571428571429

Don't watch it for a deep story line or you will be disappointed.",1391558400,,325,3.9393939393939394

5835428,5,B00DNF1S28,"We've added this to the pile of movies to enjoy over Christmas with family.

This is family centered humor and situations, playing on generational conflicts and the difficulty of randomly finding true respect and love in the dating life.

Two thirty-somethings trying to reduce friction with family set about to perform well rather than to do well.  Both sets of parents have their suspicions, best represented by the hilarious lighting of candles scene, but the appeasers try to continue their facade until cornered.  Meanwhile they are the last to know that they have come to admire and enjoy each other.  Not a new theme or movie idea, but a very likeable setting for this incarnation.

Actors were well selected for this lighthearted slice of life, and the story becomes more plausible because all the lies have to be revealed.  What makes this especially appealing are the scenes where misunderstandings are cleared up with honest confrontation, and mutual openness to making things absolutely right.  Instead of just assuming things will work out and writing our own script to complete those thoughts, the writers included the path to real reconciliation.  Which is, after all, what Christmas is.",1390262400,,1202,5.123076923076923
5835429,2,B00DNF1S28,"One of my least fav Hallmark movies. Typically Joey L.'s movies are cute but this one just couldn't find its groove.

 First, there was really no Christmas holiday- it's more about New Years. Second, there was zero chemistry between the two main characters.

This movie is basically the same premise as the latest season finale of Melissa & Joey. No originality!",1390003200,2,362,4.901639344262295
5835430,5,B00DNF1S28,This was perhaps one of the funniest yet romantic movies I have seen in awhile. The movie is inspiring that love arrives sometimes when you least expect it. The movie arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. This is another Holiday classic in the works.,1389830400,,267,4.702127659574468

5835460,3,B00DNF1S28,"I was so excited to order this film.  The leads give great performances and have fantastic chemistry.  This is one of the rare rom-coms where one actually likes the characters individually as people and jointly as a couple.  You actually wish the best for the characters.

That being said, this Hallmark version is garbage.  The rendered resolution is quite poor.  The packaging is cheap as is the printing on the DVD itself.  The laser coating and artwork dye actually flake off at several places on the disc.  You would think that someone cooked this ""bootleg"" in their basement.  The disc image itself shows on my computer as ""HM9352DVD01"".  That's right, no actual DVD title.  I have never seen this before from a supposedly professional authoring studio.  So I heartily recommend the movie, but detest this shoddily made product.  Perhaps this is one of the few instances where it's best to only buy the digital download.",1387238400,24,926,4.896774193548387
