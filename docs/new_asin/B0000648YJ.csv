7960562,4,B0000648YJ,"After losing a star director, and battling copyright law to get this show on the air, this series started to really shine. This volume is from after the loss of Miyazaki, and this time the episodes glitter beyond even my expectations. The character may be just staying the same, and the plot twist may not be that deep, but that means anyone can understand and enjoy whats going on.

There are only four episodes this disc:

Episode 11- ""The Targeted Coin Bank""

 A rich industrialist enlist Holmes and Watson to figure out why money is being stolen from his huge bank, made in his own figure. When they spot two familiar goons, they think the mystery's solved. But what does the millionare's son (who loves the people of his dads city) have to do with the missing money?

Episode 12- ""The Professors Big Failure in the Storm""

 This episode is exactly what the title proposes: the prof goes after a treasure, and gets caught up with when Holmes and Watson take off after in a diragible.

Episode 13- ""Missing Freight Car?! The Professors Magic Trick""

 Holmes and Watson are traveling via train, on a late night ride home. Between the two passenger cars is a freight car full of gold buillion. When the ride gets bumpy, Moriarty strikes, and upon arrival at the station, the two passenger cars are together with the middle freight car gone!

Episode 14- ""Gourmet! Coral Lobsters""

 The detectives are called to test a famous oceanologist's aquarium security system. While it would seem he collects only rare fish, but gems are also a hobby. When his beautifull coral and jewel-encrusted lobsters disappear, we find out Moriarty has one weakness: his favorite food is lobster. If he eats enougbh of this brain food, will he be able to fool Holmes and Lestrade?

This disc contains the same old redone transfer and quality, with very few marks or fuzz from the original 8mm left over. This time around, we get one special feature: a restored and creditless opening and ending. This is great, but why wouldn't theyvadd the restored credits to the show?

This disc comes through despite it having one less episode, however for kids or adults, this one will go by super fast. Anyone can enjoy these episodes, and you don't have to follow the series in order to get whats going on. Another great installment!",1130803200,3,2303,4.7225
