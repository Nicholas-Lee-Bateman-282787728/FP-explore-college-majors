8011485,1,B0001EQI56,"This is a review of the pictured box set from Good Times Video.
There must be 100 things with this same title.  I was hoping for a set of the PD TV episodes.  It's huge, but all these are are poor Sandy Oliveri documentaries of PD Skelton stuff chopped up and scattered about.  There are no complete episodes that I can see except for an edited version of PUBLIC PIGEON # 1, the excellent TV version from the Climax series.  That can be found by itself elsewhere.  The thing takes up an enormous amount of space (8 regular DVD cases) and the covers are the same pictures of Red you have seen over and over so I just kept the DVDs and tossed the cases.  When the thing came in the mail, I thought someone sent me a Volkswagen!
Better to go with the stuff put out by Red's estate.",1416355200,,778,4.153333333333333
