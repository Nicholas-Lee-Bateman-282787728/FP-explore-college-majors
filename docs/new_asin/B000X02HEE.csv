2993224,5,B000X02HEE,"I had heard tales about the Louisiana Honey Island Swamp Monster, and watched this film while visiting a friend, who had bought his DVD at a Louisiana Gift Shop. I enjoyed the movie because it was not a big budget Hollywood film, but raw and real with authentic Swamper story-tellers who lived on houseboats and river camps. Most of the eye-witness encounters were believable, though a few make you wonder. It is the legend and lure about this creature that is so facinating. I think my children would also enjoy it because they like monster movies and this one is tame enough for them to view, so I just ordered a copy for our collection. I also enjoyed the swamp scenery and original music.",1244678400,8,692,4.588709677419355
2993225,2,B000X02HEE,"As a hardcore Bigfoot and monster fan, I was thrilled to get this DVD as a birthday gift.  It's clear that Dana got herself a video camera at Best Buy, called some of her friends and family, told them to put their teeth in, and decided to make a buck off the hoaxed footprints her dad made decades ago in the Lousiana swamps. The results are entertaining as hell!

Smug, self-styled Rambo-wannabe swamp rats with big guts tell about terrifying encounters with monsters.  Drunks who slur out tales of ghastly meetings with the terrifying beast.  Even an interview in a living room in which a loud phone rings and the interviewee finally yells off-camera for someone to pick it up.  ""Expert"" guy talks about tree-dwelling swamp apes and how the cast of an alligator print Dana shows him is in fact, from just such a primate.  There's even a scene where the ""monster hunters"" break up a night time riverside party asking the kids if they've seen the monster.  Screams from the movie ""Snowbeast"" are broadcast from hidden speakers in an attempt to scare the kids. That fails and the kids sense a ""Punked""-style setup, so they leave.  So embarassing, it is almost impossible to watch...almost...

Would I pay money for this DVD?  As a pure schlock-fest, it's entertaining, if somewhat wince-inducing.  As a ""documentary"" it's not worth a whole lot since there's no real insight into the hoaxing of footprints, the film, or any serious treatment of the ""legend."" In essence, it's a mockumentary in a Scooby-gang style, or a fan-film, and an amusing one at that!

But plug it in, grab a case of Pabst or Hamm's and get ready to enjoy an hour and change if you've got some time to kill and like folk tales about boogeymen.",1244592000,,1714,4.657807308970099

2993227,4,B000X02HEE,"Having watched this several times, I like it more each time. I keep it together with my other bigfoot documentaries. The sound is such that you want to play with the volume here and there. However, it is a lot of fun following the reporter as she interviews quite a long string of people regarding their very own encounters with the monster. Not all the people interviewed were talkative (or loud), so the reporter does a good job at getting them to talk with her various questions. No matter, the people interviewed seem credible. There is a swamp monster hunt at the end, followed up by early footage of the monster from Harlan Ford's camping trip. The swamp monster and bigfoot apparently are not 100% the same type of creature - based on the cast of the footprints. The sounds this creature makes is rather creepy. So what would be sufficient proof this creature exists? Had they captured video of the creature being shot down in broad daylight, dragged to the autopsy table, and poked and prodded and sliced and diced - this still would not be enough for some. This is one that should not be missed by the open minded, the big foot lovers, the X-Files lovers, the creepy campfire story lovers everwhere.",1337817600,,1208,4.623255813953488
2993228,4,B000X02HEE,"We've cruised the Honey Island Swamp a couple of times.  It is large, well-used, and full of crawdad, fish, birds, alligators, and snakes.

2993229,2,B000X02HEE,"""The Legend of the Honey Island Swamp Monster"" is an extremely low-budget bigfoot pseudo-documentary made by Dana Holyfield, granddaughter of the late Harland Ford, whose 1963 Louisiana swamp bigfoot footage inspired the project. While she is doubtlessly sincere in this project, the final product is highly unlikely to convert skeptics. The bulk of the DVD is interviews of locals and of a gentleman who is an author and ""authority in the field of alternative knowledge"", whatever that means. The remainder of the DVD is a nighttime trek through the swamps where there has been a Honey Island Swamp Monster sighting. There are lots of dogs barking, some unidentified sounds, a tailgate party gone awry, and an intense search for the creature...but it got away.

The best footage in the DVD is from one of Harlan Ford's early 1970's color film reels which purports to show the monster, though it is behind a lot of foliage and appears extremely briefly just before he ran out of film. The worst aspects of the DVD are the general quality of the interviews, and the accompanying terrible audio quality, which makes hearing and understanding the native's testimonials very difficult. I realize, also, that the film was made on a small budget, but when faced with a miniscule budget, it's generally best not to have original bigfoot-themed music added to the soundtrack. The re-enactment footage at the opening of the film is also quite entertaining for all the wrong reasons.

I am giving this DVD two stars. It is not of very high quality, and I seriously doubt many will be convinced by the presentation, but I do appreciate Dana Holyfield undertaking an independent film production. Although it's amateurish, she actually decided to make a movie about something she found compelling, did her very best, and made it happen. You have to admire tenaciousness, and in that regard bigfoot skeptics and believers alike owe her a thank you.",1279756800,5,1934,4.984520123839009
2993230,1,B000X02HEE,The follow up DVD to this film proves that the whole thing was a hoax. The shoe with the monster claws was found and the locals all admit the whole this was started by one man. This BS story was almost as bad as the Patterson film hoax.,1278633600,4,236,3.9375

The video is shoddy quality.  The audio is a mess and most of the interviews you can't hardly hear the person talking.  Camera shots are awful!

8226262,1,B000X02HEE,"- not so for this similarly titled let-down of a documentary. It even has a bad song that goes on forever  (like Boggy Creek). Poorly produced; I understand ""actual footage"" will look like home video(blurry, shaky, bad sound) but the ""host"" segments were just as bad, and the font-itus was just hard to watch (lets make the titles appear like they are being flipped from a book page - over and over again) and the titles were so blurry I couldn't really read them. If you have an older gentleman telling his story that happened in the early 60s, how about asking the people sitting  on the sofa behind him to move - at least till the interview is over - and they're not even sitting still! they're busy talking and feeding something (I couldn't tell if it was a baby or a puppy - because the picture looked like 10th generation video) - and then the phone starts ringing and they don't pick it up till after a few rings, meanwhile we can barely hear the man telling his story because the sound is so bad to begin with.  Painful.
 WHY this movie is on Amazon Instant Video is a more interesting debate than the debate about bigfoots existence.  I love bigfoot documentaries, but this one needs to stay in the swamp.",1431129600,,1214,4.426008968609866
