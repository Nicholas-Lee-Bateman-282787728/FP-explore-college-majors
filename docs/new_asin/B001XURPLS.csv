8347780,5,B001XURPLS,"I thought that this DVD was great, mostly because I haven't seen any other DVD out there for the EA exam. It's basically tips about the exam, and it's an instructor in front of a class. Aside from the other material, I actually thought that the disk about Prometric was the most improtant one, and it was only about 40 minutes. But I get really, really nervous when I'm taking tests (I mean, REALLY nervous) and the information on the disks really helped me. I actually finished part 2 of the exam with about 10 minutes to spare, and last time I took the exam I ran out of time, so this helped a lot. You still need a book, though. But if you're expecting spectacular special effects or whatever, don't buy this. I still thought the picture quality was better than the NATP course I bought.",1244592000,,790,4.380952380952381
8347781,2,B001XURPLS,"Poor product that lacks professional production.  Poor graphics and editing.  If you like watching someone read from notecards and referencing a flip chart, this is for you.  Video barely builds upon the information found in their book.  Some good aside-type advice is given (e.g. things that have appeared on tests frequently), but mostly restates information found in their book.",1243987200,2,381,5.406779661016949
