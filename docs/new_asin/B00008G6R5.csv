7983231,3,B00008G6R5,"I saw Les Ballets Trockadero live and they were amazing. This video, however, is not of a very good quality, so their amazingness is harder to see on the DVD. I was disappointed that the videography wasn't more professional.",1321401600,,224,4.769230769230769
7983232,5,B00008G6R5,so glad to find this film!!! lots of fun to watch.  amazing dancers have fun with the classical ballet!  loved it!,1280016000,,114,4.380952380952381
7983233,5,B00008G6R5,"A new look to traditional Ballet favorites, with all parts danced by men, many in drag, and with satire thrown in. Fun, but probably not for traditionalists or homophobes. It was amazing how feminine they could look as long you as you did not get close enough to see their beards and deliberately overdone makeup. They also seemed to have picked the ugliest guys to dance the female romantic leads. I think someone really enjoyed ""putting on"" this production.",1220572800,,459,4.822784810126582
7983234,4,B00008G6R5,"I saw the Trocks live many many years ago, and I see that they are still just as talented and funny.",1184284800,,100,3.8095238095238093
7983235,5,B00008G6R5,"What amazes me the most about the Trocks is the fact that some of them outstrip their ""female"" counterparts on several levels. Robert Carter can out fouette any woman I have ever seen, and he brings across the classic diva attitude in every performace. Carlos Garcia plays up the ""I'm just too adorable for my own good"" ballerina, Jai Williams is always so dainty, wearing the taped-together glasses for every big show-stopper and Paul Ghiselin is the perfect Trock-he can dance, and he has the facial and body expressions to seriously make the comedy aspects work.
Ken Busbin and Fernando Medina are two of the dancers I always felt dance better in their respective gender roles. Ken was amazing as Siegfried in Swan Lake, and Fernando has the athleticism of a Russian gymnast. His barrel turns and scissor jumps in Le Corsaire put any male dancer in the Kirov to shame.
But I kneel at the feet of Bernd Burgmaier. He is impossibly tall, he has impeccable technique, his beautiful arabesques make me, as a former dancer, INSANELY jealous, not to mention he just might be the most adorable creature on the planet. I think I just might be developing a crush, granted, of the very very very VERY non-requitted variety :)",1182729600,8,1218,4.75
7983236,5,B00008G6R5,"I have first seen the Trockadero - the original - in 1972 or '73 at Finoccio's in San Francisco and bought both videos for memory's sake. I highly recommend this video to anyone who enjoys good comedy. but especially good ballet - excerpts though these are. Although the dancers are female impersonators, my hat's off to them for performing so excellently en pointe, a fete extremely difficult (so I understand) for the male physique. Today they impressed me as much as they did 30-odd years ago.",1171843200,3,496,4.77906976744186
7983237,5,B00008G6R5,"I took a trip to England at the end of March 2006. The highlight of this trip was a performance by the all-male ballet group ""Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo"" at the Peacock Theater in London.

The unique ""Trockadero"" company had returned to London for the first time in five years. The company's 15 professional male dancers performed some of the greatest moments of classical ballet, including extracts from such classics as Paquita, Raymonda, and Swan Lake. The Trockadero Ballet was outstanding. Each dancer plays a male and a female role and has two stage names. This is a truly international company of extraordinary quality. The male dancers play the roles of Russian ballerinas so skillfully and so gracefully that it was hard to believe that they are not women. The dancers are great athletes and great comedians. Their parody of classic ballet is tasteful and hilariously funny. I liked them so much that I purchased a DVD of their performance soon after I arrived home.",1146182400,13,986,4.904191616766467
7983238,5,B00008G6R5,"If you appreciate excellent ballet and have a sense of humour, then this is for you.",1141257600,7,84,4.3125
7983239,5,B00008G6R5,"If you are looking for something a little different in ballet, you should try this.  the Trockadero troupe offers comedy, men dancing on pointe as women, and men dancing as men.(unfortunately, they do not offer men dancing on pointe as men, which has been explored by others, nor do they explore women dancing as men.)  They are very entertaining and dance quite well, showing a serious side in addition to the comedy.  The company director points out that they also make it a point ( a pointe? ) to do unusual pieces, not done much by other companies, such as ""Raymonda's Wedding"" in volume one and ""Yes Virginia, Another Piano Ballet"" in volume two (volume two is also available through amazon.com ).  As a male ballet dancer myself, the differences in what makes movement masculine or feminine is something I and all serious dancers explore; perhaps this troupe helps shed some light on this.  The overall emphasis here is comedy, not any heavy message, so this dvd should appeal to a wide audience.",1092009600,25,1002,4.76878612716763
7983240,5,B00008G6R5,"I first saw Trocks on an A&E production and I've been waiting for ages for them to put out a DVD.  Is your family tired of your ballet videos?  Want something you can put on that everybody will ""get""?  Have you got enough balletomane friends that know the ""Siegfried's best friend"" joke?  Have a party and put on the Trocks.  Enough of the humor is broad that everyone will get it (and howl), enough of it is ballet and choreography in-jokes that the knowledgeable will howl too.  And you will be stunned to see men dancing on pointe---and unlike the proverbial singing pig, doing it WELL!",1077408000,18,589,4.509433962264151
