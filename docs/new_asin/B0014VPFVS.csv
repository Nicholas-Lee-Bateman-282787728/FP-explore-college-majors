3135114,5,B0014VPFVS,"An ultra conservative is elected as the French president, giving rise to riots in Paris. A gang of Arab Muslims that include Tom, Alex, Farid, Sami, and Yasmine steal money to escape the regime, but Sami is shot. They split up, hoping to meet up in a remote location later on. Yasmine takes her injured brother to the hospital with Alex, where he dies and she escapes the authorities. Tom and Farid with the money go to an in run by a strange family near the border. The people are welcoming in an uncomfortable way and something is deeply wring. They have no idea the inn contains horrors that they never imagined.

I watched Frontier(s) years ago and felt underwhelmed maybe because of its similarities to other films. However, upon rewatching, it's a powerful, intense film that's part Hostel, part Texas Chainsaw Massacre and pushes it further than either of those films. The film starts with the riots in Paris, establishing the city as dangerous. The drama within the Muslim gang is quickly revealed as Yasmine is pregnant with Alex's child and thinking of having an abortion because they aren't together anymore. Yasmine and Sami are the most likeable of the entire group, which makes it all the more tragic that Sami dies at the hospital. I was completely outraged when the hospital staff opted to notify the authorities of possible criminals rather than helping the man bleeding out. This shows how the world won't help them due to some brand of bigotry because there was no indication that they committed any crimes beyond the color of their skin. The imperative of the hospital to help people is secondary to that bigotry. Alex and Yasmine have no time to mourn Sami before they are forced to flee and meet their friends at a remote inn.

This brings us to the Hostel segment of the film where Tom and Farid arrive at the inn, greeted by Gilberte and Klaudia. The women offer them rooms free of charge and seduce them. Tom is completely into their offer, but is also quick to insult them when they reject sexual advances later. Farid rejects them at first, but then ends up videotaping their encounter. Like Hostel, the seduction proves to be a way of luring and distracting the men for more nefarious purposes. Through all of their seduction, it's pretty clear that Klaudia and Gilberte feel scorn at best or hate at worst for them. Then all of them plus the women's brother Goetz and their mother have the most awkward family dinner ever. Farid and Tom FINALLY get the hint that they are in danger, but their escape foiled by Goetz who runs their car off a cliff. They survive, but they wander into a mine shaft full of horrors. Meanwhile, Yasmine and Alex arrive at the inn, but aren't as easy to seduce or as gullible as their friends.

Yasmine is eventually captured by the family who are revealed to be Nazis. Their patriarch, von Geisler, stayed in France after World War II and created his twisted family by capturing children and having his own children to raise as Nazis and to carry on luring and killing people for their possessions and for their meat. He decides to use Yasmine to save them from inbreeding, as many mutated products of it live in the mine shaft. He isn't bothered that she is already pregnant and plans to force her to wed his son Karl who will eventually take his place as patriarch. This neo-Nazi family is the product of France's complicity in their occupation during World War II. Some resisted, but others gladly participated. The focus on moving forward afterwards led to the nation refusing to acknowledge the atrocities committed on French soil. In the present day of the film and of real life France, this also led to conservative, racist ideals to fester over time, leading to the election of President Sarkozy and the horrible treatment of immigrants, especially of Muslims. The Geisler's aren't shown to be odd outliers, but a product of ignored French history left to develop in a remote part of the country.

The Geisler family isn't completely devoid of good people. The most sympathetic member is Eva, a child-like woman underestimated by her family. As a child, she was kidnapped and told that she might be returned to her family if she was obediant. Her own children are the monstrous mutants in the mine shaft, but she loves and cares for them as she would any other child. Her kindness sets her apart from her family even though she is complicit in their crimes. Yasmine and Eva reflect each other in a way, as pregnant mothers doing their best in the midst of criminals and being criminals themselves. Both go to extraordinary lengths for their children even in the face of great opposition and they help each other. As von Geisler resolves to teach Yasmine's child to hate its own history and people (echoing Sarkozy's recent comments of immigrants rejecting their own culture to become truly French), she resolves to make her baby safe and allow her child freedom in the face of a toxic society. It's clear right from the beginning with her treatment at the hospital that if she does return to conventional society, her treatment would not be much better.

Fronter(s) does have familiar elements seen in other films, but the basis in French history and society plus additional elements such as Eva sets it well apart from American horror films. It's a particularly brutal film in the New French Extremity movement and one of the best in my opinion. Alexandra West's book on the subject was instrumental for me to gain historical and social context for this films and others in the movement. French history is much more tumultuous, dark, and bloody than a lot of media will have you believe and it's fascinating that the horror genre is the one to show that dark underbelly.",1491782400,,5737,4.715852442671984
3135115,3,B0014VPFVS,"There's pieces of a good movie in here, but it never really gels. Equal parts Green Room and Texas Chainsaw (but not as good as either) with a dash of the socially aware torture not-porn that New French Extremity is known for, Frontier(s) has some good points to make, but it does so unevenly. Obviously the antagonists of the film are insane, but whatever internal logic they're operating under is ineffable, which damages the film's believably and immersion for me.
The script isn't the only hiccup for the film. Some of the cinematography borders on divine, but that's offset by action shots which are filmed in shaky-cam at some absurd frame rate so that everything resembles a cheap war movie. At points it feels like there's two different cinematographers, each at war with the other's style. Worse still, a few shots are augmented by CGI to get ""interesting"" results, but wind up looking obvious and feeling unnecessary. Also obvious and unnecessary is the CG blood, considering how many buckets of the real stuff show up onscreen.
Overall Frontier(s) isn't terrible, but it's far from my favorite of the New French Extremity films. Better examples of the genre include Inside (2007), Martyrs (2008), and Calvaire (2004 - Belgium). I think fans of the genre may enjoy Frontier(s) without being wowed by it, but regular viewers might struggle with the clumsy and ham-fisted (albeit timely) attempt at social commentary and uneven filming.",1491609600,2,1444,5.020833333333333

3135121,2,B0014VPFVS,"I tried to like this movie after reading so many positive reviews on it but sadly couldn't.  If I could go back and watch the movie fresh I would honestly skip the entire first half of the movie as it just dragged on and it didn't add anything to the movie for me.  I didn't gain some sense of connection with the characters it just kept going on and on.  When it finally got to all the HORRIBLE gore that I read so much about to me I almost wanted to laugh.  There have been movies that have done so much worse, and since I had no connection with the characters it honestly didn't bother me too much...I kind of just wanted the movie to get to it's point...or the end.

This has a little bit of story to act as a catalyst for the gore so it was tolerable, but it's worth mentioning that Tobe Hooper wrote that story in the early 70s.  Not that it detracts from the movie being entertaining, but (as lots of people have pointed out), Frontier(s) is very much like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  It isn't a movie that references it, or pays homage to it, it just kinda copies most of the ideas and puts them into another setting.  It wasn't the first, or last, film to do that, and if you're curious what all the hype about the movie was, there's no reason not to check it out and enjoy it.  I don't see myself re-watching the movie anytime soon or raving about it to friends, but I'm not bothered that i paid the few dollars to cross it off of the list.",1477958400,4,869,4.242424242424242

The filmmaker was already famous with the movie <HITMAN> and he is all into britaility and no sexuality at all. In this movie he could have shown some nudity but he doesn't even show any single moment of skin of the main charactor at all.

But if you watch this film, you cannot but to close your eyes from time to time because an axe sticks into the man's head or the head being cracked totally or even more intensive shots will knock your brains out right in the spot.

This movie can be compared to Eli Roth's <HOSTEL 1,2> But since his movie is more combined with sexualty as well, this is not at all. That is the difference.

If you see the image of the dvd and expect something sexual, don't be bothered.

I was watching this movie about 1 Am and was totally awake. I usually sleep at 10:30 pm since I wake up at 5:00 am sharp. It was that shocking.

Karina Testa was doing her job really well. I think she was born for this roll.
All th other actors include the old man who act as a German nazi style guy who kidnaps a bunch of people who wants to stay at the hotel of some kind and brutally kill them and make them into mummy or something. That actor was really something too. I think his name is Jan Vlask and surprisingly he was in the movie <HOSTEL> as well.

If you still have guts to watch this movie, you should be totally prepared. This movie is of course unrated and uncensored.

3135138,2,B0014VPFVS,"During a riot in the streets of France, a group of thieves manage to pull a heist and make off with a duffle bag full of cash. The group is forced to split up when one of the crew members, Yasmine (Karina Teste), is forced to take her wounded brother to the hospital after being shot. Two of the members manage to escape and make it to a small hostel on the outskirts of the city. Things seem fine at first but soon take a turn for the worst. -summary

I have to come out the gate and say that if one is searching for a horror film with even an inkling of originality is better off looking elsewhere. The Frontier(s) directed by Xavier Gens is about as original as drumsticks. One will find traces of many shocking horror films sprinkled around. Unfortunately for me, this movies lack of originality is the least of its problems. It just really isn't all that good of a horror movie from France, when looking at some of the really good stuff that makes up the New Wave of French Horror such as Inside.

I think Gens drops the ball immediately with his main characters, since 75% of them are almost completely unlikable. Most of them simply comes off as jerks, and when they begin to be put through the grind I simply didn't feel bad for them. This also goes for how ridiculously dumb some of them can be, such as a guy by the name of Farid (Chems Dahmani), whom has not only one but two chances to eliminate a tormentor and simply botches it. I know dumb characters goes with horror films like beans to rice, but even as a fan this is still something difficult to get use to. The scenes could have been better thought out.

The plot begins to pick up when Yasmin and her partner Alex (Aurelian Wilk) make it to the hostel as well, and more hell begins to break loose. The plot is just boring for the most part, and the characters simply don't make things better. Some of the major killings come off as a proper enough pay off; they work very well delivering a nice amount of brutal gore. I like the gore effects for some of this stuff, and for the most part they shouldnt be spoiled.

I didn't have much of a problem with the acting as much as I did the really flawed script. The actors worked well enough with what they had; therefore I cant exactly fault them for any wrong doing. The films message also comes off very flat since its so masked behind the flaws in the writing. I cant stress enough how bad the writing is here. The group of bandits apparently run into an escape Nazi, and some of the things they do really don't jell well with their history. Not that I need this in my horror films, but one of the key forms of torture by Nazis was to strip their enemies of their clothes. This movie had no nudity at all which is really a blow when looking at the villains they were up against. The film wants to be shocking yet it couldn't even get that completely right.

The Frontier(s) is a movie Im quite mixed about, but I lean more towards disliking it though. It seems as if Gens felt since the antagonist where lead by a Nazi, then it automatically made them the ones to hate. When you don't even care for most of the main characters despite facing off against such a notorious hate group, then something is definitely wrong. I can only recommend this film to the most hardcore horror fans. After several re-watches I finally give up trying to find the appeal to this.",1454457600,,3379,4.289968652037618

3135160,5,B0014VPFVS,"Xavier Gens' Frontier(s) owes so much to Tobe Hooper's original Texas Chainsaw Massacre that you almost feel Hooper should be collecting royalties on itand yet when you look at it from a different angle, Frontier(s) has so many innovative takes on the basic TCM scenario (a group of young city slickers running afoul of a backwoods family with strange customs) that it would really be a shame if it were judged only or primarily as a TCM tribute (or ripoff, depending how you feel about it). And yet, I think it's worth looking at the two side-by-side.

I've done my best to give only the tiniest of spoilers here, just itty bitty hints of what goes on...

I think of Tobe Hooper as a sort of Thelonius Monk, jazzing it up in all sorts of ways nobody was expecting and dashing all kinds of expectations. So many elements of Leatherface and his family go unexplained, the pace of events shifts at all sorts of unconventional places, and it ends in a spot that almost feels like there should be a whole other act.

Whereas Gens is like this obsessive classical composer focused on using structure to his advantage. Not to spoil it, but the whole second half of this film is basically an escalation of adrenaline-filled, climactic moments so well planned an executed that it's almost impossible not to watch without getting an adrenaline rush.

Hooper dropped all sorts of cultural and even subtle political references into TCM, and just let them swim around like goldfish; Gens's F(s) has a political point about racism in France that he's hammering home from the very first moments of the film when Yasmina says her world is anything but fair and equitable and then we cut to a massive Paris riot in response to the election of a far-right-wing French President.

TCM was shot on the cheap, and the film-stock graininess gives it a natural and inimitable time-stamp as a work of the late 70s. Hooper and his people went to great lengths to spell out the madness of Leatherface clan in ever element of set dressing possible, throwing in details like the weird ornaments skewered on the barren branches of the trees outside the house, details for the curious viewer to puzzle over before the carnage begins.

F(s) on the other hand is very slick. I've no idea how much money it cost to make and no interest right now in looking it up, but it looks pricey to me, and while there are all sorts of little details in the set dressing here as well, they are overpowered by a great attention to atmosphere. The air in the barnyard looks thick, the palette of the farmhouse interior seems to exude a musty odor and you can almost picture the rust on the hinge of the scissors during the haircut scene. But I promised no spoilers.

I will say, though, that the key element of the crazy, backwoods family is much more fleshed out here than in TCM. Each character gets something of a backstory and a character arc.

If there's one thing I find similar about these films, it's that, moment-to-moment, they were both quite unpredictable to me on first viewing. I had a general sense in both films of where things were heading (and, I mean, come on, with a name like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you sort of know what's coming), but if you had paused it for me in the middle of any scene in either film and said, ""what do you think is about to happen?"" I wouldn't be able to guess with much confidence. That's pretty rare once you realize how formulaic movies tend to be.",1427414400,4,3451,4.563812600969305

3135163,4,B0014VPFVS,"The first time I saw Frontier(s)/""Frontire(s)"" some years ago on On Demand's Fearnet (RIP), I honestly had no idea what I'd be getting myself into. While this did turn out to be a extraordinarily well written French horror movie, I got more than I bargained for in the end, which I will get to in a moment.

So the plot of this film takes place in Paris, France where heated riots break out, following the election of an extremist right-wing candidate to presidency. Friends Alex, Tom, Farid, Sami, and a pregnant Yasmine hope are looking to flee the city to escape from the chaotic riots but try to pull off a bank robbery first to have enough cash to get them out of town.

The bank heist fails as they're caught by the police and a chase ensues. Sami is the only one who gets caught, leaving Alex, Tom, Farid, and Yasmine to successfully escape to the border of France where they find refuge at a family-run motel inn. All seems well until the four discover that the family that own this motel are a clan of savage cannibalistic neo-Nazis. The sadistic and psychotic leader of this family sees potential in one of the friends to become the newest member of their family and take the Aryan master race to the next level. What follows is an all out violent war for survival and escape that can't end without bloodshed. Quelle horreur!

Overall: In my opinion, Frontier(s) may very well be the most violent and goriest film released by After Dark in their history of film-making. Remember when I said that I got more than I bargained for when I watched this? Well I was speaking in terms of the blood. I'm typically not a fan of gore movies, so it was a bit tough to watch this movie at times. I guess you could say it was a French version of Saw only less or more bloody depending on how you look at it. In fact the film was deemed so violent, the MPAA gave it a NC-17 rating causing the film to get a limited release in US theaters for one weekend only before copies were sold on DVD. Despite the gorefest produced in Frontier(s), the story plot was nicely written out, making for an interesting story. Whether you're a fan of gore or a good story or both, I recommend adding Frontier(s) to your collection. I'd have given it a 5 if it weren't for all the bloodshed.",1424822400,,2268,4.382422802850356

3135169,5,B0014VPFVS,"I've been a fan of other french extreme films over the years like Martyrs and Inside to name a few. But I have to admit 'Frontier(s)' absolutely takes the cake. After a single watch, I was completely hooked. The movie is intense from start to finish.

Acting 3/5 It's hard to judge the acting in a movie written in a language I don't speak, but I don't remember anything too poor acting wise, in fact most of it as i recall was rather good.

Gore 5/5 Don't listen to the other reviews saying this is ""torture porn"" or a ""gorno"", that is a complete lie. Anyone who says this is torture porn has absolutely no clue what they're talking about. There is a decent amount of gore in this film, all of which is done incredibly well, but you can tell that gore is NOT the main focus of the movie (which is good and works in the films favor.)

Character Development 4/5 Although it's somewhat hard to follow along since the film is in French, in which I don't speak, I felt as though I actually cared about most of the characters in the film. There is just enough scenes in the beginning (before all the action begins) to give me enough background on our main characters, and gives me a reason to care about them and actually feel upset when they die.

Atmosphere 5/5 This films offers a very dark feel atmosphere wise. Almost all of the camera shots in this movie are rather dark, which often is a bad thing for a film, but it works in this one. Also the hostel in which our main characters take refuge in fits the mood of the film VERY well.

I loved it, I hope you do too. This movie is a modern masterpiece (in my opinion).",1421280000,,1618,4.240259740259741

3135179,4,B0014VPFVS,"Frontiers(s) is a one of those films that has been popping up on many horror fans' ""most violent films' list in recent years. The film does have somewhat of a reputation. It was given the NC-17 rating and therefore wasn't shown at Horrorfest 2007. Instead it was shown in only about 10 theaters in the US, and then released on DVD shortly afterward. Since then, the film has gotten noticed and more popular in the horror community. And I do have to say I was rather pleased with this one. It doesn't necessarily break any new ground (maybe a new wrinkle here and there), but what it does do is combine certain elements of other films while also delivering in the blood and violence department as well. From Hostel to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, sprinkled with a little Descent, any horror film buff will pick up on certain similar elements to other films, but it does add its own little twist to it. The beginning of the film involves a group running from the law after a bank robbery. Needing to get out of the city, they stumble upon a Hostel out in the country. The backdrop of the film does involve social unrest and rioting, and I'm sure the director was going for some underlying theme here. However, none of this is important to the actual film,and its basically a vehicle for the movie to get where it needs to go. Overall, the story isn't bad at all. The acting is pretty good, especially from the main antagonists. Personally, I didn't like the shaky camera work during some of the action sequences. And if I'm going to get picky, (SPOILER ALERT), I found a tad silly that a girl who's been through hell and back can take out a family of rough and tough Nazis nearly single handed, yet they can't simply aim their weapons and shoot her without hesitating or missing her at point blank range. All in all though, this is good one. It definitely has a few brutal moments and has a couple of cool deaths.

3135196,4,B0014VPFVS,"This is a well-composed, solidly executed film and lovers of cruelty and jaw-dropping violence will likely enjoy it.  It's not great--but very good for sure.

I'm beginning to develop a fondness for extreme French cinema.  Martyrs (2008) and High Tension (2003) delivered some solid splatter along with well-thought stories that didn't seem run-of-the-mill, formulaic or familiar.  Frontiers may follow the ABCs of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie, but it remains well-executed and moderately interesting.

Four morally questionable twentysomethings flee to the country from Paris after political events result in violent riots citywide.  They find their way to an inn run by some rather crude, aggressive, lascivious folktwo attractive women, and their rough brother Goetz (Samuel Le Bihan; Brotherhood of the Wolf).  They exude a strange mixture of unnervingly forced hospitality and an almost sociopathic abrasiveness.  During their stay we come to find that much more of this strange family runs things around hereand not in the most conventional of ways.

This twisted family turns out to be a bunch of cannibalistic neo-Nazis with a patriarchal pecking order and they have plans for their new guests.  From here, as with any Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn, Hostel or Hills Have Eyes film, we sit back and watch while wondering if any of our protagonists make it out alive.

Writer/director Xavier Gens (The ABCs of Death - X is for XXL) brings us from a socially/sociopathically awkward bed and breakfast to a tour de force of violence, cruelty and gore.  From hooks through Achilles tendons to using boltcutters on Achilles tendons, this film provided me with ample reasons to wince...and a lot of reasons for me to fear for my Achilles tendons!  The sound editors clearly had their hands full with all of the bloodsplatter, bludgeoning, crushing and stabbing going on.

I was especially pleased with the acting.  I don't speak French, but the fear of the victims felt real and the family had a more intelligent and methodical Texas Chainsaw-esque vibe to their unsettling behavior and fearful respect of their father.  The fear was certainly merited and shared by the audience because of the tone set by the constant violence.  Although the violence never turns to rape or sexualized violence (like so many movies just out to shock us at whatever cost), there is abundant violence against women and the ease with which it's executed is truly illustrative of the soulessness of our villains.

I found this to be a well-composed, solidly executed film and lovers of cruelty and jaw-dropping violence will likely enjoy it.

This review was of the unrated director's cut, which was not available with English dubbing.  Surprisingly, the subtitles seemed poorly translated at times.  I won't explainit's no big deal, but you'll see what I mean unless you can follow the film in French.",1395964800,4,2892,5.149892933618844

3135198,1,B0014VPFVS,"Ok. 1st, the plot was really non-existant other than the fact they were a nazi family that eats people for food & serving their guests the same, hanging them up on hooks in a freezer. 2nd, in any evil situation, realistically there should have been NO LIMITS to any of the scenes, however this is the unrated version & it is cut & censored when it came to any love-making or scenes where nudity should have been a big issue. I mean these were some nice nazi's! They are so kind to kill & let the victims keep their clothes on while they are being slaughtered. Also there is a scene where the captured woman Yasmine is forced to sit while one of the nazi's family cuts off yasmine's hair, again all dressed & that is so unrealistic considering that the nazi's sent endless numbers of victims to their deaths in the freezing cold with no clothes, no hair & no hope. During the war with Hitler jews were sent to a place called THE SHOWERS WITH NO WATER after cutting off their hair. It was a very unsavory experience for the jews. So here we have nice nazi's, no rape scenes, (Yasmine is already pregnant by her boyfriend who dies) & the nice nazi's are good with that because they are looking for new blood in the family. There is no nudity, & the film is definetely one you can call grade B-low budget to say the least. So unless you are looking for a movie where the only thing that happens is watching clothed people being slaughtered then avoid purchasing this movie as it is certainly not worth the money. This is a true example of fiction created after the millenium. in this case, the movie was made in 2007 using a more societal expected setting, not a true realistic setting for a film. Just what you would expect from society as they think it is better to show less than more. Sorry society, but disney is your setting & the real world is not that nice. Also the language is set in french & only english subtitles are available. Hope this helps you when making a real purchase over this bogus one. Thanks",1392854400,,2012,4.3537234042553195

3135224,4,B0014VPFVS,"Gotta hand it to the French, for they don't have the limiting filters that American filmmakers have to trudge through to make an appealing horror film- they just throw everything in.
Right after a round of French presidential elections strike heavy controversy, riots break out all over Paris, leaving a small group of anarchist friends to hightail it out of Paris with money they stole and get away from the police. Unfortunately, even this group of anarchists tend to get volatile on one another. It doesn't take long for that to get noticed. They split in groups and head out (for safety reasons, odd for anarchists) and one group end up at a little family-run inn. At first things seem normal... but then, this is a French horror film, so nothing's what it seems. And it quickly develops from there to a lot of heavy-hitting moments of heavy confusion and violence, chewing out, etc.
Then the next group comes in, and things get even more sinister. Things are hinted at (like how the family are not really French, but German neo-Nazis- hinted through what they talk about), things get obvious, and no punches are pulled.
Let me say this- if you are used to intelligence in a horror film, there's not an abundance here, yet it's a thought-provoking horror film nonetheless with its subtle themes and subthemes, heavy-lining insults that, unlike many American horror films I see anymore, actually fit rather well with the overall tone and atmosphere. The violence, as well, gets a very noticeable editing award from me. Heavy sadistic violence abounds, including extreme domestic violence (a woman, in one scene, gets kicked a few times in the stomach and a very hard foot-knock to her face, for instance), a man gets boiled by steam, another man gets his Achilles' tendon snipped (and it doesn't hold away from view of that), while there's a couple creatively explosive firefights and (what was to me the highlight of the violence) a very gruesome, cringe-worthy death by circular saw.
The editing team for this movie did an extremely good job at making it all seem hyper-realistic. I give them great credit for this.
Then comes the taboos of the film, like how it's never once mentioned, just hinted that the family are neo-Nazis and are called ""degenerates"" (and not in the typical American way of crudely insultive way, either), and even a hint of superstitious belief of an immaculate son (held by an ignorance of how one woman got pregnant anyway), not to mention a very vague hint that the family could be cannibals.
In other words, with all the hinted subthemes, the film covers many of the things Americans fear in a non-supernatural horror flick, and does it quite well.
If there's anything about this film, it's what felt like a brief lag in the exposition between the friends escaping Paris and the actual start of the torment in the inn for the first group of friends. Beyond that, I found this quite an enjoyable torture flick with a strong, thought-provocative storyline, evocative themes, and even a uniquely bittersweet ending that's open for thought.
For me to actually enjoy a torture film is entirely out there, since the only other torture films I've enjoyed were Saw, Saw 2, The Final, and Dread. No other torture films have managed to grab my attention thoroughly like those and this one.

3135229,3,B0014VPFVS,"It's not a bad film. I decided to check it out, because I love the After Dark Horrorfest series, and I read an article from BloodyDisgusting.com that called this Xavier Gens best film and that people that saw this were disappointed by The Divide (which I saw first). I feel like I should check whether or not that article was written on April Fool's Day.

So, first thing in my mind is the nazis. I think, at this point, nazis are sort of caricatures of bad guys; so, to make them scary, they have to be really well done, and this film fails at that. The history of the characters is barely touched, so it seems like the writer just said: We need villains. Ok, how about nazis? Yeah, that works, throw them in there.

Dramatically, the film is lacking. One thing I loved so much about The Divide was the emotion and relationship between characters. It feels like a pretty short time before we're left with just one hero, and the male lead is the not so charming ex-bf of the only female. I felt like the characterization could have been much better. The most interesting relationship of the film dies in maybe the first thirty minutes.

Too many unanswered questions: There are zombie/crawler characters in the film, but where did they come from? ...and there is one character that talks about not leaving her babies. Ahm...yeah, where are they? (Not in this film, that's for sure). Why are the characters running, in the first place? I didn't really understand why the characters were fleeing police.

These are the main reasons I gave this a three star rating. If the opinion of BloodyDisgusting.com is any indication, this film is grossly overrated.",1361145600,,1652,4.647260273972603

""Frontier(s)"" is a French horror film released on DVD as one of the ""8 Films to Die For"". I haven't been too impressed with that film line in the past, but occasionally, there is a good one, and this one is pretty good. It's not the most original film in the world. It largely plays out like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (with elements of ""Hostel"", of course, but way more like ""Chainsaw""), though it transforms a bit into a revenge flick towards the end too. The acting is great and there's some top notch gore, and I like the character of the much more pregnant girl, who was one of the family members and was pretty cute. She might have been a hunchback, but because she was pregnant I sometimes wasn't sure if that was why she was carrying herself like that.

3135248,3,B0014VPFVS,"Depending on what you've heard, Frontier(s) is either A.) a bloody masterpiece of French horror or B.) a derivative hodgepodge of cliches lifted from other horror films. I'm in the middle--no, it's not original or groundbreaking, and yes, it does borrow from a number of past films (although it doesn't attempt to hide its influences) in the genre but it is a blast and much better than most American horror films made today. At the end of the day, it's a well-made horror film with some great performances, a decent plot, some political subtext and extra helping of gore.

The film takes place in a possible future in France, in which an extreme right-wing government has taken control and riots take place in the street. Those familiar with current French politics will get more out of it than those who don't, as the film was made in response to riots that have taken place in the country recently. A group of thieves attempt to take advantage of the political climate, but things go wrong and they find themselves heading off to an inn for shelter... an inn that just happens to be run by Neo-Nazi cannibals. Needless to say, things get messy.

Frontier(s) isn't a deep film by any stretch of the imagination, but it works. All the actors are great in their respective roles and they take the film seriously as opposed to for camp. There really isn't a single bad performance in the film. The cannibalistic family is fantastic as well--there's a nice range of characters here, from some who are actually quite sympathetic to those who are nothing short of despicable. While I don't see this becoming a ""franchise"", I wouldn't mind seeing these characters and their histories explored elsewhere.

The film is pretty bloody but at the same time it's not unwatchable in its goriness. Nor is it particularly 'upsetting', like other French films in the genre. It's more of an intense, visceral thrill ride than anything that will leave you depressed. It's a pretty bleak film but it's not soul-crushing.

Unfortunately, the DVD presentation is... not so good. For starters, there are no special features whatsoever. The international release is apparently stacked with features, and LionsGate couldn't port over a commentary, a featurette and maybe some deleted scenes? It's frustrating that so many American releases of foreign films drop the ball in this area.

Even worse are the subtitles. It's like someone just ran the script through Google translate and didn't bother to actually consider how well it sounded to English readers. Example: One character calls another ""trash"", the subtitles read ""garbage can"". At another point, a character asks ""What are doing!"" For what it's worth, the film is still watchable and you'll still enjoy it, but there's still no excuse for this kind of sloppiness. Unfortunately, there are no real alternatives unless you own a Region-free DVD player. If you speak French fluently, there's a Blu-ray release in France that has no subtitles. I guess the best I can say is that at least this DVD gives you the option to turn off subtitles. Something you'd take for granted, but even that isn't guaranteed nowadays (see the Region 1 DVD of Thirst). Overall, the impression is that LionsGate just didn't give a damn, which is a shame. I'm guessing they thought that since it's a foreign film they didn't need to put any effort onto it and put out the cheapest possible disc possible.

I still give this disc my recommendation, albeit with some serious caveats. Take it as you will.",1317945600,,3513,4.876046901172529

There is a background story that is introduced in beginning and provides adequate reasoning for where they ended up. I found myself showing sympathy for these main characters in the film and that was unusual as well as nice for me. Usually in Saws and Hostels, you do not care about who dies, but with this I felt they did a great character development. There are plenty of high tension scenes that provide you with usually a bloody ending;) There is a particularly squirmish scene where two of the guys are crawling through a hole in the movie that was more bothersome than watching the descent. AHH!! It made me wanna stretch out my arms and roll around to be thankful I was not caught in a freaking hole. The ending (climax) of the film was enjoyable as well and this is important because a movie can make or break it from an ending.

3135260,5,B0014VPFVS,"The first time I watched ""Frontiers"", going in with these huge expectations, I was not only amazed (and somewhat appalled) at what I was watching, but how the film had surpassed the hype. I was genuinely shocked at what was unfolding before me. ""Frontiers"" is horrendous, but in a truly positive sense. It's hateful, and brutal, and violent, and anti-human. But I loved it! I was so happy I had bought the DVD from Amazon instead of renting it.

Last night I re-watched it with three of my friends, none of which had heard of the movie and who barely knew the plot other than what I vaguely explained while the commericials were rolling. At the end one of my friends was crying, and she couldn't even tell me why. Another said he didn't feel like doing anything, that he was emotionally-drained and felt like going to bed, while the last one said she felt ""weird"" and for the rest of the night remained silent. Without exaggeration... that's how powerful and gritty this film is.

Some bash it for being derivative of things such as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and even ""House of 1000 Corpses"", and while there are parallels and I cannot fault them for saying so, the movie does what it does very well (better than those three installments) and I think it was more of a homage to those other quality horrors.

It's fair to say when watching a movie with such a shock factor involved, things like acting and direction fall leeway; taking up the passenger seat and letting the violence lead. Such is not the case in ""Frontiers"". The acting on all levels is great, even stupendous in a few cases -- each character adding his or her own little bit to the story and cranking up the believability. Katrina Testa as Yasmine deserves mad props especially, during the film's second half her acting is just so raw and real you want to hug her and never let go.

The characterization is great. Before the craziness sets in the film devotes a good 30 minutes or so to acquainting us to the characters and really making you like them. This makes what eventually happens to them all the more devastating.

The cinematography is very crisp and fresh -- especially notable during the opening scene. It captures the bleak atmosphere of the film beautifully, to the rolling hills of the France-Luxembourg boarder to the depths of the Von Geisler chambers.

I feel like I'm rambling, and quite honestly I feel at the same time I have not written enough of how AWESOME this movie is.

All lengthy paragraphs aside, and if you can stomach brutality -- watch, buy, love ""Frontiers"".

3135261,3,B0014VPFVS,"I'm going to be totally honest, so you know where this review is coming from:

#1) I am not a fan of blatant movie remakes. When I say blatant, I mean anything that has the exact title of the old classic they are remaking, to the movie that changed the name, but rips off so much from another movie they might as well have called it a remake. This year's Frontier(s) is the latter.

#2) I do not like subtitles. It's not because I don't like to read, I just find that I am not experiencing the movie entirely because sometimes I am making the choice to either catch either the text or the visuals out of the corner of my eye as I focus on the other. I guess it would help if I just studied all the languages so I could watch movies without subtitles, but I'm just too lazy. Movie-dubbing usually doesn't do the trick either, so it's a lose-lose situation for me. Frontier(S) is a French flick, therefore it uses subtitles.

  Frontier(s) is a horror film that follows four criminals who rob something(they don't tell us what, but there's a big sack of money with them and the police are after them) during a series of political riots after a conservative regime takes over in Paris, France. They split up and flee to the country-side, and arrive at a hostel that, to their surprise later, is run by a family of cannibalistic Nazis, the leader of the family, Le Von Geisler, probably being ex-Gestapo. They find this out the hard way. Through a series of ordeals that brings new light to the term ""dog eat dog world"" and busloads of blood, the characters learn that even outside of society there is corruption and greed, and purity is in the eye of the beholder.

  The gore in this movie is exceptional. From a normal gun-shot blowing apart someone's hand to the beautiful use of a table-saw, the blood is strewn with a Frontier(s) bloody image shotgunheavy brush. It is so gruesome that the producer of the movie, After Dark Films, had to pull it from their After Dark Horrorfest series because of an NC-17 rating by the MPAA. It was either that or edit it a bit. I think they made the right choice.

  The story and symbolism is quite good too. Although it is a horror movie, it is an intelligent horror movie, besides the TCM rip-off, which I will get to later. Of course a Nazi would be hiding out in the middle of nowhere in France, having his family kill impure visitors and eat their flesh. Of course the family would be inbred. Of course the only law in the area happens to be the eldest son of the family, negating any sense of justice for outsiders. All of this, and it works. By the end of the movie, the farce that this family has concocted is just as real as the real world, where politicians are corrupt and using people to their whim. Heavy-handed? A bit, but at least it has more of a brain then the usual slasher movie.

  The problems of free use of elements from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre start once we get to the hostel, and they don't stop until close to the end. Instead of a feeble old man being fed at the dinner table(grandpa in TCM), we have the family's mother, who is actually spitting out the food(we find out what it is made of later on.) We also have the family police officer, the only law-man in this party of the country, blocking off the road to their house to make sure they don't have party-crashers as they hunt down these kids. He's like R. Lee Ermey from the TCM remake, without the comedic twist.

  The greatest massacre to a horror figurehead is Goetz, the French Leatherface of the film. He plays the executioner/butcher beautifully, but he acts way too much like Leatherface, even without a chainsaw. The most annoying point is when he is chasing two of the criminals in a car, yelling and squealing like a pig, just like Leatherface. The problem is, Goetz speaks fluent French, unlike Leatherface who can only grunt and squeal. It seems too forced. They could have Goetz looking like a wild dog without giving him a transcription of Leatherface monologues. Maybe I'm being too harsh.

  All in all, this movie is worth a rental at least. The political intrigue and human interaction are worth experiencing, as well as the buckets of blood",1263427200,,4186,4.454188481675392
3135262,4,B0014VPFVS,"after viewing the film...my thoughts were:  wow, this was a really good horror film.  The acting was very good, believable (especially the lead actress); the emotional tension / visual blood scenes / physical violence were mixed together well. I even liked the soundtrack, which fit perfectly to create a sense of unease.

the plot is somewhat reminiscent of the recent (2003) re-make of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". (Group of young people get trapped in an isolated area by a family of psychotics).  Also had a few plot elements of ""Hostel"".

I thought the various fight / conflict scenes between the characters was well-done- the sound effects, level of violence, and misery was felt at the gut-level as a viewer.

My only complaint:  the first part of the film (first 20 minutes) wasn't really needed, and could have been cut out of the film.  Rest of the film flows very well.

To me Frontier(s) is no more horror than Hostel, which in my book is anything but.  There seems to be a developing propensity from both audiences and industry folk to label anything that's ultra violent, horror.  There's nothing remotely unsettling or frightening about this film.  What we have is a solid thriller about a group of thugs that take advantage of civil unrest in Paris to commit some crimes and then leave the city, headed for the Belgian border and relative safety.  They come upon a desolate hostel that happens to be run by family whose patriarch is an elderly Nazi looking for a concubine to be broodmare for his psychotic heir.

3135273,3,B0014VPFVS,"Fronti&egrave;re(s) (Xavier Gens, 2007)

First off, can someone tell me what it is about the French and pregnant women? This is the fourth French horror film I remember seeing that deals directly with pregnancy. Second, why is it that, once again, I find that the more publicity a French movie got in America, the worse it is? Not that Fronti&egrave;re(s) is anywhere near as awful as, say, Haute Tension, but still, it's the kind of silly, derivative twaddle I'd expect from, well, Hollywood. (It's not a coincidence, I suspect, that director Xavier Gens was immediately imported to make the videogame-movie Hitman. Which should tell you all you need to know about Xavier Gens' directorial skills).

Fronti&egrave;re(s) draws about equally from American ""torture porn"" movies and the Canadian suspense flick Straightheads, though it desperately wants you to believe that its primary influence is Mathieu Kassovitz' La Haine. Here, we have a small band of Parisian radicals who have had to flee the city after one of them dies in custody. They all decide to rondezvous at a hostel somewhere outside the city. The first two find one and send the location on to the second batch before they realize that the place is run by some very nasty types who think the Vichy government is still in charge of France (and are quite happy with that). It doesn't help that these guys are Muslim... all of this sets up the arrival of main character Yasmine (Karina Testa), who tells them that she's looking for her friends...

I should say that there's nothing specific wrong with this flick. It's competently directed, competently acted, with the expected cast of young-and-beautifuls. My problem with Fronti&egrave;re(s) is that there's nothing overly right about it, either; this is a movie that steadfastly refuses to find anything new and interesting in the material it presents. If you're simply looking for a slasher flick with which to kill time, you could do worse than this one, but there are plenty of under-the-radar flicks of this stripe that do it better (may I suggest Turistas, if you haven't seen it yet?).  ** ",1238371200,2,2112,4.971671388101983

And I'm not talking about torture or sadism; though our villains are not very nice people, this film does not engage in the pleasure-in-cruelty that makes certain films (like Audition) unwatchable to me. It's certainly gory, but it's authentic, thoughtful and believable horror, with characters who aren't cyphers. If this is typical of French work, I'm definitely going to be seeing more French horror films.

Ms. Testa out-Jolies Angelina Jolie in her beautiful-yet-grittily-real depiction of Yasmin, the fugitive who is the film's protagonist. With her beautiful and vulnerable face and Gallic passion of her character, Testa is amazing in what may well be the most physically demanding role I've ever seen an actress play. You have to see the film. It's not that she does a lot of stunt work, though there is enough of that. But you can feel the adrenaline coursing through her veins during this film and that's what makes her so effective.

There is also legitimate creepiness in the pregnant daughter of the house, who is mad past all help and who tries to ""help"" Yasmin understand the family's plans for her.

Interesting and gripping French/Swiss horror thriller is one of the better horror imports of recent memory! The film does offer a little political subtext as one of the major subjects of the film including the idea of fascism and terrorism. There is graphic scenes of torture and gore like a man boiling in a very high steam room and a few cringe inducing moments, the film does have decent acting and decent direction as the film is France's answer to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as it leaves you shocked and feeling sorry for the characters. Luc Besson (""Leon"", ""The Fifth Element"") serves as one of the producers, this is definitely a worth while shocker that has guts literally and some good ideas.

Synopsis: a group of French young criminals are on the run after a heist while Paris burns during the 2005 riots that turned the French capital upside down for weeks. Traveling in separate cars, they decide to meet at a shabby hostel in the coutry... but the place is run by a family of sadistic killers led by an old Nazi.

Yes, it is gore galore.

The problem with these torture-porn films is that there isn't much story.  They just turn into a cat and mouse 90-minute journey where every three minutes there's an excuse to someone to lose limbs, the head, get cut, sawed to pieces, etc, etc, etc.

The good thing is that the journey here is made with great actors as the film shows a great cast of young French actors along with some familiar faces.

The bad thing is that the screenplay here copies from 100 other great (and not so great) films we've already seen. No, there isn't one single minute here that you can call original.

So here's the deal: great actors, great makeup, lots of gore... but there's nothing here we haven't seen before.

3135287,5,B0014VPFVS,"Paris. The presidential election of a far-right politician leads to large scale riots. Amidst demonstrations and exploding molotov cocktails five young robbers flee after a heist. There is three months pregnant Yasmine, her brother Tom, who has been shot, Farid, Sami and Alex. They decide to split, and while dying Tom is brought to hospital, two guys are sent in advance to find a quiet hotel near the border. To make a long story short and in order to avoid giving too much away, let's suffice to say that all four end up in a miserable hotel in a remote area (and later in an abandoned mine) in the hands of cannibalistic nazis.
And blood will flow in rivers...

I am a big fan of FRONTIER(S). I have already watched it numerous times and of course there will be repeat viewings in weeks, months and years to come!
The movie is incredibly intense, with lots of atmosphere (like the creepy dinner scene, where the nazis toast to ""pure blood""). It makes excellent use of the run down locations and the nazi theme. Admittedly FRONTIER(S) is not the first backwoods splatter movie, but it is the combination of  various plot elements that make the story so original (the political subtext, pregnant heroine, gore galore, nazis). The film manages to be absolutely convincing and believeable due to Xavier Gens' assured direction. It never ever is campy or  trashy. The excessive bloodletting will appeal to all splatter fans, trust me on that!
And of course more intellectually minded viewers will have a heyday discussing the political subtext afterwards.
Actors deliver powerhouse performances and most have outstanding screen presence (especially Samuel Le Bihan as Goetz). I was particularly impressed with the gorgeous looking Estelle Lefbure as blonde nazi bitch Gilberte (given her looks I would not mind running the risk of landing on the dinner table) and Jean Pierre Jorris as head nazi Von Geisler. I also give kudos to Karina Testa as Yasmine in what must have been an exceptionally challenging role, both physically as well as emotionally. (Wait until you see her character's escape from the pigsty!)
It has been said that the gunplay in FRONTIER(S) is unfitting for a horror movie. Quite aside that firstly this is not the first horror film with gunplay (e.g. THE DEVIL'S REJECTS features lots of it) and secondly many other ways of inflicting mayhem and violent death (from steam chamber to axe and also including a hearty bite in the neck usually seen in zombie movies to mention just a few!) are graphically shown, I think that the shootouts are not only excellently choreographed and filmed, but also quite appropriate for the characters and the nazi theme. Von Geisler has a Luger handgun, Gilberte sprays bullets with a Schmeisser submachine gun, Junior nazi boss Karl shoots a German carabine and big Goetz even a light machine gun!
FRONTIER(S) is in my view however not without faults. I have two complaints:  The nazi father's few sentences in German (mostly well-known Third Reich slogans like ""Arbeit macht frei"")  are oddly accented and once or twice there are mispronounciations. Of course, this will  likely go unnoticed by international audiences, but as a native speaker of German I could not help notice it (okay, okay, I admit I am really nitpicking here). More grave is the occasional ultra-fast paced editing. I am no fan of  MTV-style editing. However it would be very unfair to emphasize these rather minor shortcomings, as these do in no way
diminish the impact of this exceptional horror fest.
Unfortunately there are no extra features on the DVD to speak of, just a couple of  admittedly very well made and interesting trailers - THE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN,  the new RAMBO movie, the excellent THE BACKWOODS  and rather fittingly, HIGH TENSION, the gory slasher film which started the new French horror wave a couple of years ago (by the way, check out the last two movies, I have seen both of them and can assure you that you won't be disappointed with them).

3135288,4,B0014VPFVS,"I ordered this movie along with Inside.  Inside was insane, and completely lived up to it's hype.  I loved it.  I was definatley looking even more forward to viewing Frontier(s), as it wasn't even released for rental in the U.S.  This I took as either a bad sign (wouldn't make any money in theatres, which is typical of horror films anyway) or it was an excellent sign (too graphic for open public consumption.)  When it came and I saw it, I admitt, I did feel a little disappointed, but it's definately not a bad movie either.  Production quality is top notch, and acting is very decent, excluding a bit of which could be considered overacting by our heroine, Yasmine (Spasmic convulsions overcome her within the last 10 minutes of the movie that are a little unbelievable.)  But with all of the hype that came from this boy, I expected something a little more manly. Not damn bad, but nothing I havn't seen before.  I will give the movie four stars for the most climactic, and original killing I have seen in awhile, including an axe, a shoulder, a table saw, and a solarplex.

3135290,3,B0014VPFVS,"In the sixties a group of young directors from France led what was called the new wave of motion pictures. Names like Godard and Truffautt led the way using new techniques and making cinema something different. A current new wave of French directors are out to make a name for themselves as well, but this time around they are adding something different to an already familiar genre. The new French wave revolves around horror films. Their takes have been seen recently in films like HIGH TENSION and INSIDE. Now we have FRONTIER(S).

The one thing that may make this movie more of a challenge than most is that it definitely loses something in the translation. While many of us are aware of what goes on politically in other countries, we don't know the details, much as other countries don't know the same about us. This film begins with the political riots in France and a group that loots and then hits the road.

One of them has been shot and his sister, Yasimine, insists they stop at a hospital.  Dropped off along with Alex, Yasmine waits and watches as her brother dies. The other pair, Tom and Farid, keep going with the intent of meeting up with them later.

When their car begins to run low on fuel and they tire, Tom and Farid stop at a country inn with hopes of a food and a place to stay. What they get in return is much more than they bargained for. At first approached by two young women who work there, they are later attacked and discover that this inn is nothing more than a home for a group of cannibalistic killers. Too late, they're caught and tortured.

Yasmine and Alex find their way to the inn after leaving the hospital. They are greeted much like their friends were. When Tom and Farid are nowhere to be found, the pair is captured as well. Imprisoned, Yasmine is given an exemption from being tortured as the group has other plans for her. Having scraped the bottom of the gene pool among this limited group, she has been chosen to bring fresh blood in.

As the film progresses, we learn that the leader of this tribe is an ex-Nazi who escaped here after the war. Still strutting around in his best brown shirt outfit, he rules the roost like the dictator he worshipped. Yasmine, who is already pregnant, does her best to escape. But does she? You'll have to watch and see.

The biggest thing to be said about this new wave of French horror is that it takes the most brutal of what has been seen in the genre and turns it up a notch. Torture seemed to take on its own fan base with the film HOSTEL. Those same fans will love what they see here. Gougings and slices are found throughout. The blood flows freely and the bad guys and good guys alike fall like bowling ball pins at different points in the film.

I'd heard so much about this movie before seeing it. RUE MORGUE magazine hailed it as one of the best horror films in years. But to me it was nothing more than a continuation of the torture films that seem to proliferate these days, imposing bloodletting for real horror or chills. The creepiest part of the film was the malformed children of one of the crazies that hide in the tunnels on their land. These are truly scary looking creatures shown only in night vision. Sadly, they are used very little and yet were the one thing that caught my attention. I would have liked to see more or learned more about them.

On the whole, this movie should be considered a ground breaker as the French are not a group to embrace horror films according to the directors of INSIDE. Perhaps that is why they have chosen to pay more of homage to the retro days of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE HILLS HAVE EYES with films like this one. But the fresh takes offered show that there is new blood being pumped into the genre, and either the French will take it over or inspire others to do the same and bypass the Hollywood remake syndrome that seems to have taken over.",1214524800,,3894,4.404728789986092
3135291,4,B0014VPFVS,"now the last week i have been watching a lot of french movies, mostly horrors. some thrillers as well, like gaspar noe's revenge drama irreversible, plus his movies where we follow a french horse meat butchers life in paris ""i stand alone"" and ""carn"". what struck me though is how much i enjoy french horror. movies like ""ils"", ""l'interieur"", ""haute tension"" and to some degree ""calvaire"". and now ""frontier(s)""  which was next to l'interieur and haute tension as my favorite one. in an age where most american horrors fail to intrigue me (with exceptions like aja's the hills have eyes remake and perhaps frailty), and a lot of asian horrors include the same white dressed black haired ghouls. france is breathing life into horror. frontier(s) sets off with 5 young thieves fleeing paris during the riots, one of them has been shot and is begging the others to take him to the hospital. so the group split up, 2 is taking him to the hospital while the other 2 is fleeing with the money. to later meet up outside of paris. the latter come across an inn in a rural part of france , where they are told that they can stay the night for free. soon what started as fleeing from the police in paris and jail sentences, ends up as fleeing from cannibalistic neo nazis for their lives. some have said that it borrows heavily from other movies, well it's not the most creative movie i have seen. yet it got a lot going for it with sympathic characters. some cool visuals and leaving you with the feeling that you really want the victims to escape this. (i'm usually rooting for the killers). some stand out details and a great atmosphere through out. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will most likely re-watch it over and over again. (the movie suggest a lot instead of showing wounds and carvings, but it does it in such way that it doesn't leave me feeling like i'm watching a ""disney horror"" and you do get to see tendons cut!=goodie) i recommend it for horror fans, not for the rest",1213574400,,1981,4.533519553072626
3135292,1,B0014VPFVS,"To say that this French thriller is derivative would be a compliment. FRONTIERES follows a road map of other previous films. It travels from RESERVOIR DOGS Place down PSYCHO Lane as five (soon to be four) friends escape Paris with a duffel bag full of cash. There's a signpost up ahead. It reads ""FRONTIERES"" with an arrow pointing right to HOSTEL and one pointing to the left to TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (in little letters below that it says ""the remake""). A little on up the road there's a detour marked THE DESCENT. All of these places are in the idyllic French countryside in the county of HAUTE TENSION.

Throw in a Nazi war criminal as a patriarch, some terrifically hot girls, and a few thuggish brutes and you've got all the makings of the next Rob Zombie film. I was casting the American remake in my head as the events of FRONTIERES predictably unfolded. The joke, of course, is that the film is named FRONTIERES but it doesn't boldly go into any territory that horror fans (especially those enthralled with torture porn horror) haven't been to before.",1213488000,27,1061,4.67379679144385

This story line gets even better when the family decides that the female that they have captured is just what they have been looking for to expand their inbred gene pool.

What hurts this flick (other than all the obvious ripping off of other flicks that came before it and have been done and re-done to death by now) is the fact that I, as a viewer, did not give a damn about anyone in this gorefest. I mean it did not bother me one bit what the McVictims were put through.

Most of these horror flicks coming out of France just don't seem to work. What's going on? Looks like they had a budget and a decent crew. What happened? Why is this genre effort such a dud?

I guess there is always Joe Spinell's Maniac, John McNaughton's Henry, the 1974 TCM, the original When A Strang Calls...

 And, oh yeah, not only are the actors  in Frontiers ugly to look at physically, but their behavior is ugly (to the bone.) Look, even that wouldn't turn someone off to a horror film, after all, these films are SUPPOSED TO HORRIFY, are they not? Trouble is we never get to know anyone here. The camera (read writer/director) never spends enough time with any of the people (good or bad) in his film & the result is we just aren't moved in any way whatsoever.

3135297,3,B0014VPFVS,"After reading Woopak's review, I'd defer to a number of his descriptions of the movie, and agree with his assessment of the film. There is relatively little here that is new, and calls to mind a number of torture/revenge/exploitation films of the 70's, and the more recent Haute Tension and Hostel franchise. It is notable that all these flicks had an element of social commentary hidden beneath the violence, and Frontiers is no different.

The film's backdrop of the election of a neo-conservative president and the surrounding riots it creates gives context to the characters we get to know as they flee the police after a bank robbery and head for the border. There is even a reference to America (not unusual in French films) that they have elected ""our own George Bush."" It is not surprising then that when our band of anti-heroes find an isolated hostel as a meeting point that the proprietors are indeed Nazis intent on preserving the purity of their race.

The violence in the film is cruel, repetitive, and palpable, and there is some originality to the gory scenes, though I'll admit growing a bit jaded about how creative movie makers can make deaths more gruesome. For me, perhaps the most captivating scene involved little blood, but had two characters trapped in a long, narrow tunnel, attempting to find a way out. It was tense, claustrophobic, and expressed a sense of urgency other than the cringe you experience when a character is horribly mutilated or murdered (again, not terrbly new, considering the Descent captured that mood throughout the film).

There is certainly some pleasure in the vengeful aspect of the film as our heroin exacts her own revenge upon her tormentors, and there is plenty of reason to despise the captors. The cavernous structures beneath the hostel provide ample room for a few impressive chase scenes and unique settings for some to experience their demise.

Overall, this does not add anything new to the genre, but it does take much of what has been done in other films, gives them a twist, and recreates it in a different setting. That is not necessarily a bad thing, and if you are a fan of the torture/revenge flicks, this will certainly not disappoint.",1212624000,,2207,4.846153846153846

The MPAA, rightfully I might add, stamped Frontier(s) with an NC-17 rating, prompting the distributor to shoot for a limited American unrated theatrical release coinciding with this release on DVD.  This is a French film and given that I felt the French horror film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside/dp/B00125WATQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside</a>&nbsp;was among the best horror films to come out in quite some time, my hands were wet with anticipation to see this little movie.  The comparisons to Inside are undeniable as it is not only French and violent to the extreme, but its protagonist is pregnant and the film is set among the chaos of French riots and civil unrest.  There was a message hinted at in spurts during Frontier(s) but the film was just too vile to place emphasis on Gens's political leanings.

Frontier(s) follows a gang of thieves who exploit law enforcement during riots to commit a pretty hefty heist.  The robbery is botched and the gang of four splits up.  The gang ends up in some rural hostel that turns out to be a hive of Neo-Nazi cannibal kidnappers and torturers.  Let the fun begin.

One thing is for sure, the story is not original at all.  In fact, it is very formulaic and I didn't like the fact that I felt urged to side with this gang of thieves, so I rooted for Goetz, a character who is an absolute monster of a villain and made for some entertaining and intense moments.  Considering that we are seeing nothing new here and we may wonder why we're being shown these kinds of events in the first place, this was done pretty well.  I liked the atmosphere in most scenes and the feeling of suspense was pretty strong when it needed to be.  The acting was not good but it was definitely better than most films of this ilk.  The thing I liked about this movie most is that it didn't pull punches and definitely should not have.  That is kind of the point of horror films and it is probably the reason the other HorrorFest films don't work as well as this does.  Frontier(s) is to After Dark Films' ""8 films to die for"" as Takashi Miike's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Imprint/dp/B000GI3RHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Imprint</a>&nbsp;was to Showtime's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masters-of-Horror/dp/B000RIWAV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masters of Horror</a>, meaning that it was initially rejected but is probably more true to the horror genre than the accepted works were to begin with.

There were some legitimately grueling scenes that pushed my boundaries in terms of comfort.  So, as a modern horror film it worked pretty effectively and I give it a mixed review leaning toward a slight recommendation.  However, if you know you're into this sort of thing, then this movie is top notch.",1212105600,14,3333,5.806981519507187
3135299,2,B0014VPFVS,"I really can't believe how people keep raving about how great this moving is.  Don't get me wrong, I am a big horror fan.  I enjoy Horror films because I'm kind of a sick-o and I like movies that don't take themselves  too seriously.  That being said, however, I wasn't too big on Frontier(s).  It is NOT 5 star material, even for a horror film.  I mean, I'd steal it from a friend to watch on a rainy day with nothing better to do, but the $15 I paid for this supposed masterpiece was not worth it.

Firstly, let me start off by addressing the gore in this movie, which seems to be one of its main selling points.  I was pissing myself with excitement when I found out Frontier(s) had made NC-17 for violence and gore.  That is, until I watched it.  I cannot see how this movie did not make it under an R rating.  The violence and gore in this movie PAILS in comparison to SAW and Hostel, both much better franchises.  This movie came off as a French version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (which sucked by the way).

Secondly, the direction and editing bothered me the whole time. The way the movie was edited had a very choppy, self aware, look-at-me-I'm-be-so-artsy vibe to it that it totally took you out of the mood of the film.

Lastly, I just want to say that I am really, really sick of watch horror movies where the whole plot of the movie is kidnapped strangers put in easily escapable situations only to be chased around for half an hour with no suspense to be almost shot and then miraculously escape again because of sheer luck.  There was twice in this movie where a gun was pointed strait at somebody point blank and the only reason the person holding the gun doesn't take the shot because that would prevent the movie from be dragged out for another 30 minutes.

Frontier(s) just doesn't live up to the hype, it doesn't live up to its NC-17 gore rating, it doesn't  bring anything new to the horror genre, and to top it off is annoyingly self aware and self gratifying.  Only see this only if you can get it for free or for cheep.  Go buy ""High Tension"" instead, which is a much better, much gorier, and much more exciting French horror film.",1211500800,7,2174,4.349875930521092

It is a must buy,I don't want to give too much away but if you like cannibalistic Nazi's that butcher their prey ,hang them on meat hooks by their feet,make their prisoners eat their friends,Oh and mama has a tube in her throat and when they feed her it can be rather messy and unpleasant to watch, worse than Grandpa in Texas Chainsaw Massacre .

The gore was off the chain and the acting especially by the 2 female leads (Karina Testa) and (Maud Forget) is amazing and totally believable,when the final battle is finished you are just as exhausted as the remaining characters and what a battle it is. This is Slasher heaven ....

Especially if you're a longtime horror fan who's been beaten down(but not defeated!) by the lack of worthwhile genre titles released since the new millenium... and surprisingly, unlike any other moment in the history of the world up until now, France of all places, has decided to swoop in and save the day!  Frontier(s) is the newest French import to arrive in America, and oddly enough featuring the After Dark Horrorfest slogan plastered all over it(I say ""odd"" because normally the label is saved for some of the most awful films currently being dropped on the horror masses... not usually something this promising).  It tells the tale of a group of city ""folk""(n'er do well teens) who end up getting mixed up with the wrong batch of country ""folk""(inbred Nazi scum)... hijinx ensue!

But honestly Xavier Gens(my narrative just switched from talking to YOU the reader to the director... try to keep up LOL!), it's like you wrote down some of the things you liked best from your favorite horror flicks for inspiration; then a quarter into filming the movie you decided, ""well if I don't use this stuff then sombody else will anyways... so in it goes!""  It's a good point(depressingly enough), and although I would have preffered more creativity, at least in Gens hands the material is respectfully well done(like the rest of the recent ""French invasion"" of fear flicks, acting, sound, direction, and effects are all top notch).  Ultimately, Frontier(s) lacks originality and many real scares... but it's gritty, depraved, and trashy(not to mention gory!) enough to keep you entertained to the grisley end(even if you are fighting a nagging sense of Deja Vu throughout most of it).",1210982400,,1911,4.87962962962963
3135303,3,B0014VPFVS,"I've watched a fair share of more recent French horror films; ""Them"" (not the one with ants), ""High Tension"" and ""Inside"". Amazon friends Dave K and Puzzlebox have rated this film highly (I recommend reading their reviews) and of course, I have to see it or myself. I`ve read that ""Frontier(s)"" was left out at the recent ""After Dark Horror Fest"" because of its very violent nature and its NC-17 rating; thankfully, LIONSGATE have released the unrated version to sit side by side with its other ""Horrorfest"" counterparts. Director Xavier Gens is at the helm of this film; while I'm not particularly very familiar with his work, save for the video-game inspired movie ""Hitman"". If this film is once again ANY indication, the French movie scene may be really into ""stunt gore shows"".

Rioting and civil unrest breaks out all over Paris after a right-wing government is elected. Amidst all the turmoil, a bank robbery goes awry for a group of a young gang of thieves including reluctant thief Yasmine (pretty Karina Testa), who is also 3 months pregnant (?). Her brother has been fatally wounded and the gang separated, so they agree to meet in an isolated hostel by the frontier. Once in the hostel, the group would fall victim one by one to its psychopathic owners. With this plot, horror lovers should figure out what would come next in the film.

First off, ""Frontiers"" is lacking a lot of originality. An obese butcher with a mother who seems moments away from death, an imbalanced young lady, a muscled psycho (played by Brotherhood of the Wolf's Samuel Le Bihan), a psychopathic father who is also an ex-Nazi, an even psychopathic son/heir to a psycho family and loose women who seduce and flirt; oddball characters that have always been the clich for a lot of films that have the seal of ""torture porn"". The film offers nothing--absolutely nothing in terms of plot and originality; it borrows formulas from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Hostel"", ""The Descent"", ""The Hills have Eyes"" and ""Wrong Turn"". So just what does this film offer horror fans? A lot of blood, violence and GORE.

""Gore for the sake of gore"" is actually scary when done right. This film is not a lost cause, since it does have a lot of visceral impact. ""Frontiers"" is a well-made film on a visual standpoint. While I do think there was one scene done in bad taste; the atmosphere, shaky camera work, quick edits and eerie close-ups do add a lot to exhibit the film's violent nature. The film is genre film and the villains are too cardboard for my taste. If this was a video game, this film would be classified under ""survival horror"" and it does do it very well. It exhibits the fierce and unrelenting brutality with a lot of visual impact. The gore effects look rather realistic but still retains that somewhat ""campy"" look.

Most of the characters are ""wooden"", ex-boyfriend Alex (Aurelien Wilk), Tom (David Saracino) and shy Farid (Chems Dahmani) are the embodiment of true clich, their fate would come as no surprise. However, Karina Testa was quite impressive with her performance as Yasmine, she portrays her character with convincing fervor that would make the viewer say: ""OMG, she`s in shock, on the verge of collapse"". Although, her survival skills may require a suspension of disbelief, aided by the usual movie fakery, all the villains have such bad aim when it comes to shooting the heroine. Yasmine dodges automatic gunfire, a shotgun and a pistol from a very close distance. This oversight greatly stretches the film's credibility and realism. I am also somewhat disappointed that the ""dwellers of the old mine"" weren't thoroughly explored. Seemed like they were just there to exhibit some creepiness.

Overall, ""Frontier"" is a blood-soaked affair that is solid in execution, decently acted (man, you'll be disturbed by the creepy father) and saved by the performance of its heroine. Of course, she had to resort to animal ferocity which is both shocking and sympathetic at the same time. There is a lot of sequences of sheer cruelty and the film definitely knew where it wanted to go, at least the reasons behind it all is NOT without viability, but the reason themselves are VERY FAMILIAR. It may not be the goriest film you'll ever see, but it is grisly, gruesome, atmospheric and visceral that excels in the ""torture for the sake of torture"" style but unfortunately it just didn't explore all its potential. This film is not for the faint of heart.

Recommended to hardcore horror fans and a good rental to everyone else. [3 Stars]

3135304,4,B0014VPFVS,"Since 2003 movies dealing with some form of torture have made a pretty big comeback; back in the 60s through the early part of the 80s these kinds of movies were rather popular before some what fading away. But since 2003 these movies are coming back and the major difference is these flicks are now mainstream rather than cult. Frontiers is the latest torture flick, this one out of France.

While as a whole I enjoyed I can't help, but think if this was an American movie it would probably get more heat. Frontiers takes a little bit of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (original or remake) and takes a whole lot of Hostel as well as other exploitation inspired movies. The fact this movie is French and not American it won't be seen by as big of an audience in the States; I think Frontiers is an excellent movie, but I can't help, but think some of the praise is due to it not being American. Frontiers, while it is enjoyable really has nothing original to be found.

Frontiers is quite twisted, but hardly as shocking as it's made out to be for those who know their exploitation cinema whether it be the old school or the newer ones I doubt this one will shock you much unless you are easily shocked. With that said though of all the recent hash of 70s inspired exploitation flicks, Frontiers would probably rate as one of the better ones. Making a movie like this isn't as easy as most people think it is. The common belief is torture people in the most brutal of ways and that's it.

I personally think there is more to it than that. The biggest problems movies like this often suffer from are characters who really aren't all that sympathetic and villains who are way too likeable. When the villains start spitting out one-liners they become too likeable. Thankfully Frontiers avoids that, but there is still a problem with the characters not being sympathetic.

Writer Xavier Gens does a pretty good job with the script, while the characters lacked depth and untimely weren't all that sympathetic I suppose what they go through makes up for their lack of depth and sympathy. The basic idea behind the script is your run of the mill backwoods killer movie. Like I said it takes a little bit of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a lot of Hostel just without the comedy. The script is dark, which is good and the villains are just that.

Xavier Gens also directs and is able to put together some fairly good suspense scenes and is able to keep the pace moving forward for the most part. Frontiers received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA and people talk about how gory it is. Actually, Frontiers really wasn't that gory with the exception of the power saw scene and the amazingly awesome shotgun blast to the head. Besides that the gore isn't very extreme it's just the movie has constant violence. Sometimes a movie can be so dark and mean spirited people tend to think it was gorier than it actually was. Frontiers has gore, but only 2 scenes of extreme gore.

Xavier Gens does a solid job though; he takes a very clichd movie and makes it much better than maybe it should have been. Frontiers isn't as shocking as one might lead you to believe, but it does have some very dark and twisted scenes and Gens delivers one of the better torture flicks of the decade.

The only problem is the movie does tend to run a bit longer than it needed to be. Without closing credits Frontiers runs at about 104-minutes and it easily could have been wrapped up in 90-95-minutes. Despite running longer than it needed to the pacing never really lags too much. While the excitement level might drop a little it never gets boring.

Overall Frontiers is a well-made and enjoyable movie; despite the clichs, which are many the movie works well and again is one of the better recent hash of torture flicks.",1210636800,7,3785,4.523391812865497
3135305,5,B0014VPFVS,"By the time ""Frontier(s)"" was over my teeth really hurt.  That was because I kept clenching them during the moments in this French horror film (the correct spelling of which would be ""Frontire(s)"").  This 2007 film is being promoted as the ninth of the 8 films 2 die 4 for last year's After Dark Horrorfest, because when it earned an NC-17 rating in the States it had to be pulled from the lineup.  So it has the whole vibe of being too much horror for Horrorfest, which means the expectations are pretty high when you sit down to watch this one.  On the other hand, the second crop of Horrorfest films were rather disappointing so you figure this one has to be an improvement, and the good news is that it certainly delivers.  I am not the sort to close my eyes while watching the gory parts of movies (although I did close one of them in sympathetic reaction to the opening game of ""Saw II""), which is why I went the clenched teeth part.  A bad case of the measles as a child took out some of the calcium in my permanent teeth, so I am surprised some of them did not crack.

France is in the throes of some political upheaval having to do with the election of a hard line government, and while a century ago this might have sent young people to the barricades, in these trouble times they turn to crime.  With the cops on their trail they decide to hole up in this filthy little bed and breakfast.  This, of course, turns out to be a really bad mistake, and while the victims are not deserving of our sympathy on the basis of their characters, they are the hope of the future compared to their tormentors.  There is really nothing more to say in laying out the plot, because you should just enjoy the ride, if you sense of the word ""enjoy"" encompasses what happens in this film.  The film breaks down into three acts and how much you like the movie will probably come down to whether you think the final act tops the second.

Writer-director Xavier Gens (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hitman/dp/B0012RLX8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hitman</a>"") gets the credit for coming up with all this sick stuff, but credit also goes to cinematographer Laurent Bars, who gives the film is visual style, and especially film editor Carlo Rizzo, who crafts some moments of bizarre beauty through his creative use of montage.  A few horror films of recent vintage have attempted to be ""arty,"" and ""Frontier(s)"" certainly has some moments where you can argue it is cinema rather than just a horror movie.

The obvious cinematic touchstone here is supposed to be ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>,"" but I was reminded more of the original version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>.""  You will pick up echoes from a lot of other films, but it speaks to the film that I never got the feeling this was a pastiche.  I still think ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolf-Creek/dp/B000EOTVU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolf Creek</a>"" is at the top of the list for the torture-porn genre, although I am sure I have not seen everything that is out there.  But ""Frontier(s)"" is closer to that than it is to the ""Hostel"" movies or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Saw-Trilogy/dp/B000UO4F8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Saw Trilogy</a>,"" where there are mystery element in play that divert your from the blood, guts, and whatnot.  This is just one of those bloody movies where you wait to see if anybody is going to get out alive.

All I can say now is: What a difference a movie makes.  ""Frontier(s)"" was replaced in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horrorfest-2007-lineup/dp/B0012RCNDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horrorfest 2007 lineup</a>&nbsp;by ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unearthed/dp/B00127RAIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unearthed</a>,"" which means that what would have been my highest rated one of the 8 films 2 die 4 was replaced by the one I rated the lowest (although you have to grant that they were right not to have included ""Unearthed"" in the first place).  The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original-Horrorfest-lineup/dp/B000NA6C1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original Horrorfest lineup</a>&nbsp;earned an average rating of 3.7 from me and this year's were a step lower at 3.0; but replace ""Unearthed"" with ""Frontier(s)"") and the average jumps to 3.4.  I had sworn that next year I would rent the Horrorfest movies rather than go ahead and buy them when they came out on DVD (we did not get the festival the second time around), but I am glad I saw enough of the buzz about ""Frontier(s)"" to go ahead and pick it up.  The only real complaint is that there are no DVD extras.  Final Note: I wonder if the people behind the After Dark Horrorfest have noticed that their best flicks are being made in foreign lands, because that's certainly what has happened so far.",1210550400,46,5245,5.593434343434343
3135306,3,B0014VPFVS,"Despite all the good things I had heard about Frontier(s), I approached with caution pretty much based on the fact that it carries the After Dark Horrorfest banner, which a majority of those films were, to say it lightly, not very good.  However, Frontier(s) still seemed promising, and while it is a very interesting and bloody French horror film, there really isn't much here to make it memorable.  Directed by Hitman helmer Xavier Gens, Frontier(s) follows four friends fresh off robbing a bank, and running afoul of a family of cannibalstic Neo-Nazi's (yes, you read that right).  You can guess where things go from here, as Frontier(s) proves to be nearly every bit as predictable as any horror fan can guess it to be, and the lack of characterizations don't help matters here either.  However, despite what would be some otherwise fatal flaws, Frontier(s) delivers the goods in terms of gore effects and tension; of which are worth checking this film out for alone.  Compared to other French splatter fests, most notably Alexandre Aja's High Tension and more recently Inside, Frontier(s) doesn't offer up anything new or original, but it manages to provide the goods that films of this type promise, and in that respect alone, the film is worth a look for horror buffs and gore hounds alike.",1210464000,2,1297,4.904109589041096
3135307,5,B0014VPFVS,"Saw this tonight on DVD and thought it was damn good. Sadly, though, this is the only AfterDark flick that I would ever suggest renting as all the others that I have seen [] to infinity! This didn't even really seem to fit the ADHF line-up as it was very well-made and actually enjoyable and scary and gross as all hell! I watched the Unrated DVD and it certainly lived up to that! LOADS of gore and guts and awesome F/X! I have never seen a better, more beautiful blood-soaked actress than the French girl in this movie. She was amazing! There was just 'something' about the way she looked, hair cut short, wearing that strange 'wedding' dress, wielding a large axe and an even larger pick-axe DRENCHED in blood that made me feel giddy. I really got into her character and believed in her and wanted her to get sweet revenge on those sick, sick Neo-Nazi-cannibal freaks. The movie didn't seem at all contrived as one would expect. The evil, demented characters were frighteningly 'real' and these types of monsters could very well be living among us and probably are! Anyway, I cannot rave enough about the girl who played the lead role of Yasmine. She should get a horror Oscar! The way all of the characters, evil and innocent, were killed was, for lack of a better word, great! The deaths seemed to 'fit' the story well, without seeming too phony-baloney. I found myself anxious and excited and saying 'Get up! Run! GO! Fight! Kick his []! Kick her []!' when Yasmine would get smacked and punched and knocked to the ground and shot at but she always fought back, even though she was exhausted and screaming and weak, and I was totally rooting for her all the way! There was only one very small moment in the film that left me scratching my head: When the 2 male friends get run off the side of the road and end up entering the old mine they end up crawling into a hole in the wall and one of them can see light at the other end. The first guy to enter the hole was the blond guy and the bald friend followed behind him. At one point the bald guy (using his small digital camcorder for light) turns back to look down the passge that they are crawling through and see what looked to me like some evil, scary demon faced creature head with glowing eyes coming up behind them. He starts screaming for his friend to GO! GO! GO! but I was never really sure what it was he saw. I kept rewinding that scene and could not figure out what the hell that thing was. And the story never touched on it again. Was it one of the weird mutant 'children' kept in the mines? Was it a giant rat monster? Does anyone have any idea? Anyway, SEE THIS MOVIE! Hooray, Frenchies!

3135308,5,B0014VPFVS,"When this made the top ten of 2007 on BloodyDisgusting.com I was fervently trying to find some way to find it.  I looked for months.  I kept hearing how brilliant it was.  Usually when I put a lot of time into finding something that I know so relatively little about, it ends up in a huge letdown.  This absolutely broke that rule.  Some nice viscera gets sprayed around, but the compelling acting and character nuances are what really sink the hooks in deep when the blood starts flying.  There's a shaky camera technique that gets irritating only a little bit during some driving sequences, but overall the production and the director's sensibility are sharp.  I'd describe it as having some classic 70s and 80s horror trappings (cannibals, nazis, freaks, backwoods family) that are wrapped up in a nice art-house package.

3369611,5,B0014VPFVS,"An ultra conservative is elected as the French president, giving rise to riots in Paris. A gang of Arab Muslims that include Tom, Alex, Farid, Sami, and Yasmine steal money to escape the regime, but Sami is shot. They split up, hoping to meet up in a remote location later on. Yasmine takes her injured brother to the hospital with Alex, where he dies and she escapes the authorities. Tom and Farid with the money go to an in run by a strange family near the border. The people are welcoming in an uncomfortable way and something is deeply wring. They have no idea the inn contains horrors that they never imagined.

I watched Frontier(s) years ago and felt underwhelmed maybe because of its similarities to other films. However, upon rewatching, it's a powerful, intense film that's part Hostel, part Texas Chainsaw Massacre and pushes it further than either of those films. The film starts with the riots in Paris, establishing the city as dangerous. The drama within the Muslim gang is quickly revealed as Yasmine is pregnant with Alex's child and thinking of having an abortion because they aren't together anymore. Yasmine and Sami are the most likeable of the entire group, which makes it all the more tragic that Sami dies at the hospital. I was completely outraged when the hospital staff opted to notify the authorities of possible criminals rather than helping the man bleeding out. This shows how the world won't help them due to some brand of bigotry because there was no indication that they committed any crimes beyond the color of their skin. The imperative of the hospital to help people is secondary to that bigotry. Alex and Yasmine have no time to mourn Sami before they are forced to flee and meet their friends at a remote inn.

This brings us to the Hostel segment of the film where Tom and Farid arrive at the inn, greeted by Gilberte and Klaudia. The women offer them rooms free of charge and seduce them. Tom is completely into their offer, but is also quick to insult them when they reject sexual advances later. Farid rejects them at first, but then ends up videotaping their encounter. Like Hostel, the seduction proves to be a way of luring and distracting the men for more nefarious purposes. Through all of their seduction, it's pretty clear that Klaudia and Gilberte feel scorn at best or hate at worst for them. Then all of them plus the women's brother Goetz and their mother have the most awkward family dinner ever. Farid and Tom FINALLY get the hint that they are in danger, but their escape foiled by Goetz who runs their car off a cliff. They survive, but they wander into a mine shaft full of horrors. Meanwhile, Yasmine and Alex arrive at the inn, but aren't as easy to seduce or as gullible as their friends.

Yasmine is eventually captured by the family who are revealed to be Nazis. Their patriarch, von Geisler, stayed in France after World War II and created his twisted family by capturing children and having his own children to raise as Nazis and to carry on luring and killing people for their possessions and for their meat. He decides to use Yasmine to save them from inbreeding, as many mutated products of it live in the mine shaft. He isn't bothered that she is already pregnant and plans to force her to wed his son Karl who will eventually take his place as patriarch. This neo-Nazi family is the product of France's complicity in their occupation during World War II. Some resisted, but others gladly participated. The focus on moving forward afterwards led to the nation refusing to acknowledge the atrocities committed on French soil. In the present day of the film and of real life France, this also led to conservative, racist ideals to fester over time, leading to the election of President Sarkozy and the horrible treatment of immigrants, especially of Muslims. The Geisler's aren't shown to be odd outliers, but a product of ignored French history left to develop in a remote part of the country.

The Geisler family isn't completely devoid of good people. The most sympathetic member is Eva, a child-like woman underestimated by her family. As a child, she was kidnapped and told that she might be returned to her family if she was obediant. Her own children are the monstrous mutants in the mine shaft, but she loves and cares for them as she would any other child. Her kindness sets her apart from her family even though she is complicit in their crimes. Yasmine and Eva reflect each other in a way, as pregnant mothers doing their best in the midst of criminals and being criminals themselves. Both go to extraordinary lengths for their children even in the face of great opposition and they help each other. As von Geisler resolves to teach Yasmine's child to hate its own history and people (echoing Sarkozy's recent comments of immigrants rejecting their own culture to become truly French), she resolves to make her baby safe and allow her child freedom in the face of a toxic society. It's clear right from the beginning with her treatment at the hospital that if she does return to conventional society, her treatment would not be much better.

Fronter(s) does have familiar elements seen in other films, but the basis in French history and society plus additional elements such as Eva sets it well apart from American horror films. It's a particularly brutal film in the New French Extremity movement and one of the best in my opinion. Alexandra West's book on the subject was instrumental for me to gain historical and social context for this films and others in the movement. French history is much more tumultuous, dark, and bloody than a lot of media will have you believe and it's fascinating that the horror genre is the one to show that dark underbelly.",1491782400,,5737,4.715852442671984
3369612,3,B0014VPFVS,"There's pieces of a good movie in here, but it never really gels. Equal parts Green Room and Texas Chainsaw (but not as good as either) with a dash of the socially aware torture not-porn that New French Extremity is known for, Frontier(s) has some good points to make, but it does so unevenly. Obviously the antagonists of the film are insane, but whatever internal logic they're operating under is ineffable, which damages the film's believably and immersion for me.
The script isn't the only hiccup for the film. Some of the cinematography borders on divine, but that's offset by action shots which are filmed in shaky-cam at some absurd frame rate so that everything resembles a cheap war movie. At points it feels like there's two different cinematographers, each at war with the other's style. Worse still, a few shots are augmented by CGI to get ""interesting"" results, but wind up looking obvious and feeling unnecessary. Also obvious and unnecessary is the CG blood, considering how many buckets of the real stuff show up onscreen.
Overall Frontier(s) isn't terrible, but it's far from my favorite of the New French Extremity films. Better examples of the genre include Inside (2007), Martyrs (2008), and Calvaire (2004 - Belgium). I think fans of the genre may enjoy Frontier(s) without being wowed by it, but regular viewers might struggle with the clumsy and ham-fisted (albeit timely) attempt at social commentary and uneven filming.",1491609600,2,1444,5.020833333333333

If I could go back and watch the movie fresh I would honestly skip the entire first half of the movie as it just dragged on and it didn't add anything to the movie for me.  I didn't gain some sense of connection with the characters it just kept going on and on.  When it finally got to all the HORRIBLE gore that I read so much about to me I almost wanted to laugh.  There have been movies that have done so much worse, and since I had no connection with the characters it honestly didn't bother me too much...I kind of just wanted the movie to get to it's point...or the end.

Not that it detracts from the movie being entertaining, but (as lots of people have pointed out), Frontier(s) is very much like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  It isn't a movie that references it, or pays homage to it, it just kinda copies most of the ideas and puts them into another setting.

The filmmaker was already famous with the movie <HITMAN> and he is all into britaility and no sexuality at all. In this movie he could have shown some nudity but he doesn't even show any single moment of skin of the main charactor at all.

But if you watch this film, you cannot but to close your eyes from time to time because an axe sticks into the man's head or the head being cracked totally or even more intensive shots will knock your brains out right in the spot.

This movie can be compared to Eli Roth's <HOSTEL 1,2> But since his movie is more combined with sexualty as well, this is not at all. That is the difference.

If you see the image of the dvd and expect something sexual, don't be bothered.

I was watching this movie about 1 Am and was totally awake. I usually sleep at 10:30 pm since I wake up at 5:00 am sharp. It was that shocking.

Karina Testa was doing her job really well. I think she was born for this roll.
All th other actors include the old man who act as a German nazi style guy who kidnaps a bunch of people who wants to stay at the hotel of some kind and brutally kill them and make them into mummy or something. That actor was really something too. I think his name is Jan Vlask and surprisingly he was in the movie <HOSTEL> as well.

I have to come out the gate and say that if one is searching for a horror film with even an inkling of originality is better off looking elsewhere. The Frontier(s) directed by Xavier Gens is about as original as drumsticks. One will find traces of many shocking horror films sprinkled around. Unfortunately for me, this movies lack of originality is the least of its problems. It just really isn't all that good of a horror movie from France, when looking at some of the really good stuff that makes up the New Wave of French Horror such as Inside.

I think Gens drops the ball immediately with his main characters, since 75% of them are almost completely unlikable. Most of them simply comes off as jerks, and when they begin to be put through the grind I simply didn't feel bad for them. This also goes for how ridiculously dumb some of them can be, such as a guy by the name of Farid (Chems Dahmani), whom has not only one but two chances to eliminate a tormentor and simply botches it. I know dumb characters goes with horror films like beans to rice, but even as a fan this is still something difficult to get use to. The scenes could have been better thought out.

The plot begins to pick up when Yasmin and her partner Alex (Aurelian Wilk) make it to the hostel as well, and more hell begins to break loose. The plot is just boring for the most part, and the characters simply don't make things better. Some of the major killings come off as a proper enough pay off; they work very well delivering a nice amount of brutal gore. I like the gore effects for some of this stuff, and for the most part they shouldnt be spoiled.

I didn't have much of a problem with the acting as much as I did the really flawed script. The actors worked well enough with what they had; therefore I cant exactly fault them for any wrong doing. The films message also comes off very flat since its so masked behind the flaws in the writing. I cant stress enough how bad the writing is here. The group of bandits apparently run into an escape Nazi, and some of the things they do really don't jell well with their history. Not that I need this in my horror films, but one of the key forms of torture by Nazis was to strip their enemies of their clothes. This movie had no nudity at all which is really a blow when looking at the villains they were up against. The film wants to be shocking yet it couldn't even get that completely right.

The Frontier(s) is a movie Im quite mixed about, but I lean more towards disliking it though. It seems as if Gens felt since the antagonist where lead by a Nazi, then it automatically made them the ones to hate. When you don't even care for most of the main characters despite facing off against such a notorious hate group, then something is definitely wrong. I can only recommend this film to the most hardcore horror fans. After several re-watches I finally give up trying to find the appeal to this.",1454457600,,3379,4.289968652037618

3369657,5,B0014VPFVS,"Xavier Gens' Frontier(s) owes so much to Tobe Hooper's original Texas Chainsaw Massacre that you almost feel Hooper should be collecting royalties on itand yet when you look at it from a different angle, Frontier(s) has so many innovative takes on the basic TCM scenario (a group of young city slickers running afoul of a backwoods family with strange customs) that it would really be a shame if it were judged only or primarily as a TCM tribute (or ripoff, depending how you feel about it). And yet, I think it's worth looking at the two side-by-side.

I've done my best to give only the tiniest of spoilers here, just itty bitty hints of what goes on...

I think of Tobe Hooper as a sort of Thelonius Monk, jazzing it up in all sorts of ways nobody was expecting and dashing all kinds of expectations. So many elements of Leatherface and his family go unexplained, the pace of events shifts at all sorts of unconventional places, and it ends in a spot that almost feels like there should be a whole other act.

Whereas Gens is like this obsessive classical composer focused on using structure to his advantage. Not to spoil it, but the whole second half of this film is basically an escalation of adrenaline-filled, climactic moments so well planned an executed that it's almost impossible not to watch without getting an adrenaline rush.

Hooper dropped all sorts of cultural and even subtle political references into TCM, and just let them swim around like goldfish; Gens's F(s) has a political point about racism in France that he's hammering home from the very first moments of the film when Yasmina says her world is anything but fair and equitable and then we cut to a massive Paris riot in response to the election of a far-right-wing French President.

TCM was shot on the cheap, and the film-stock graininess gives it a natural and inimitable time-stamp as a work of the late 70s. Hooper and his people went to great lengths to spell out the madness of Leatherface clan in ever element of set dressing possible, throwing in details like the weird ornaments skewered on the barren branches of the trees outside the house, details for the curious viewer to puzzle over before the carnage begins.

F(s) on the other hand is very slick. I've no idea how much money it cost to make and no interest right now in looking it up, but it looks pricey to me, and while there are all sorts of little details in the set dressing here as well, they are overpowered by a great attention to atmosphere. The air in the barnyard looks thick, the palette of the farmhouse interior seems to exude a musty odor and you can almost picture the rust on the hinge of the scissors during the haircut scene. But I promised no spoilers.

I will say, though, that the key element of the crazy, backwoods family is much more fleshed out here than in TCM. Each character gets something of a backstory and a character arc.

If there's one thing I find similar about these films, it's that, moment-to-moment, they were both quite unpredictable to me on first viewing. I had a general sense in both films of where things were heading (and, I mean, come on, with a name like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you sort of know what's coming), but if you had paused it for me in the middle of any scene in either film and said, ""what do you think is about to happen?"" I wouldn't be able to guess with much confidence. That's pretty rare once you realize how formulaic movies tend to be.",1427414400,4,3451,4.563812600969305

3369660,4,B0014VPFVS,"The first time I saw Frontier(s)/""Frontire(s)"" some years ago on On Demand's Fearnet (RIP), I honestly had no idea what I'd be getting myself into. While this did turn out to be a extraordinarily well written French horror movie, I got more than I bargained for in the end, which I will get to in a moment.

So the plot of this film takes place in Paris, France where heated riots break out, following the election of an extremist right-wing candidate to presidency. Friends Alex, Tom, Farid, Sami, and a pregnant Yasmine hope are looking to flee the city to escape from the chaotic riots but try to pull off a bank robbery first to have enough cash to get them out of town.

The bank heist fails as they're caught by the police and a chase ensues. Sami is the only one who gets caught, leaving Alex, Tom, Farid, and Yasmine to successfully escape to the border of France where they find refuge at a family-run motel inn. All seems well until the four discover that the family that own this motel are a clan of savage cannibalistic neo-Nazis. The sadistic and psychotic leader of this family sees potential in one of the friends to become the newest member of their family and take the Aryan master race to the next level. What follows is an all out violent war for survival and escape that can't end without bloodshed. Quelle horreur!

Overall: In my opinion, Frontier(s) may very well be the most violent and goriest film released by After Dark in their history of film-making. Remember when I said that I got more than I bargained for when I watched this? Well I was speaking in terms of the blood. I'm typically not a fan of gore movies, so it was a bit tough to watch this movie at times. I guess you could say it was a French version of Saw only less or more bloody depending on how you look at it. In fact the film was deemed so violent, the MPAA gave it a NC-17 rating causing the film to get a limited release in US theaters for one weekend only before copies were sold on DVD. Despite the gorefest produced in Frontier(s), the story plot was nicely written out, making for an interesting story. Whether you're a fan of gore or a good story or both, I recommend adding Frontier(s) to your collection. I'd have given it a 5 if it weren't for all the bloodshed.",1424822400,,2268,4.382422802850356

3369666,5,B0014VPFVS,"I've been a fan of other french extreme films over the years like Martyrs and Inside to name a few. But I have to admit 'Frontier(s)' absolutely takes the cake. After a single watch, I was completely hooked. The movie is intense from start to finish.

Acting 3/5 It's hard to judge the acting in a movie written in a language I don't speak, but I don't remember anything too poor acting wise, in fact most of it as i recall was rather good.

Gore 5/5 Don't listen to the other reviews saying this is ""torture porn"" or a ""gorno"", that is a complete lie. Anyone who says this is torture porn has absolutely no clue what they're talking about. There is a decent amount of gore in this film, all of which is done incredibly well, but you can tell that gore is NOT the main focus of the movie (which is good and works in the films favor.)

Character Development 4/5 Although it's somewhat hard to follow along since the film is in French, in which I don't speak, I felt as though I actually cared about most of the characters in the film. There is just enough scenes in the beginning (before all the action begins) to give me enough background on our main characters, and gives me a reason to care about them and actually feel upset when they die.

Atmosphere 5/5 This films offers a very dark feel atmosphere wise. Almost all of the camera shots in this movie are rather dark, which often is a bad thing for a film, but it works in this one. Also the hostel in which our main characters take refuge in fits the mood of the film VERY well.

I loved it, I hope you do too. This movie is a modern masterpiece (in my opinion).",1421280000,,1618,4.240259740259741

These days technology can deceive the eye quite a bit.  Luckily this isn't a total despair film. Traumatic, gory and graphic...yes.

3369676,4,B0014VPFVS,"Frontiers(s) is a one of those films that has been popping up on many horror fans' ""most violent films' list in recent years. The film does have somewhat of a reputation. It was given the NC-17 rating and therefore wasn't shown at Horrorfest 2007. Instead it was shown in only about 10 theaters in the US, and then released on DVD shortly afterward. Since then, the film has gotten noticed and more popular in the horror community. And I do have to say I was rather pleased with this one. It doesn't necessarily break any new ground (maybe a new wrinkle here and there), but what it does do is combine certain elements of other films while also delivering in the blood and violence department as well. From Hostel to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, sprinkled with a little Descent, any horror film buff will pick up on certain similar elements to other films, but it does add its own little twist to it. The beginning of the film involves a group running from the law after a bank robbery. Needing to get out of the city, they stumble upon a Hostel out in the country. The backdrop of the film does involve social unrest and rioting, and I'm sure the director was going for some underlying theme here. However, none of this is important to the actual film,and its basically a vehicle for the movie to get where it needs to go. Overall, the story isn't bad at all. The acting is pretty good, especially from the main antagonists. Personally, I didn't like the shaky camera work during some of the action sequences. And if I'm going to get picky, (SPOILER ALERT), I found a tad silly that a girl who's been through hell and back can take out a family of rough and tough Nazis nearly single handed, yet they can't simply aim their weapons and shoot her without hesitating or missing her at point blank range. All in all though, this is good one. It definitely has a few brutal moments and has a couple of cool deaths.

3369693,4,B0014VPFVS,"This is a well-composed, solidly executed film and lovers of cruelty and jaw-dropping violence will likely enjoy it.  It's not great--but very good for sure.

I'm beginning to develop a fondness for extreme French cinema.  Martyrs (2008) and High Tension (2003) delivered some solid splatter along with well-thought stories that didn't seem run-of-the-mill, formulaic or familiar.  Frontiers may follow the ABCs of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie, but it remains well-executed and moderately interesting.

Four morally questionable twentysomethings flee to the country from Paris after political events result in violent riots citywide.  They find their way to an inn run by some rather crude, aggressive, lascivious folktwo attractive women, and their rough brother Goetz (Samuel Le Bihan; Brotherhood of the Wolf).  They exude a strange mixture of unnervingly forced hospitality and an almost sociopathic abrasiveness.  During their stay we come to find that much more of this strange family runs things around hereand not in the most conventional of ways.

This twisted family turns out to be a bunch of cannibalistic neo-Nazis with a patriarchal pecking order and they have plans for their new guests.  From here, as with any Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn, Hostel or Hills Have Eyes film, we sit back and watch while wondering if any of our protagonists make it out alive.

Writer/director Xavier Gens (The ABCs of Death - X is for XXL) brings us from a socially/sociopathically awkward bed and breakfast to a tour de force of violence, cruelty and gore.  From hooks through Achilles tendons to using boltcutters on Achilles tendons, this film provided me with ample reasons to wince...and a lot of reasons for me to fear for my Achilles tendons!  The sound editors clearly had their hands full with all of the bloodsplatter, bludgeoning, crushing and stabbing going on.

I was especially pleased with the acting.  I don't speak French, but the fear of the victims felt real and the family had a more intelligent and methodical Texas Chainsaw-esque vibe to their unsettling behavior and fearful respect of their father.  The fear was certainly merited and shared by the audience because of the tone set by the constant violence.  Although the violence never turns to rape or sexualized violence (like so many movies just out to shock us at whatever cost), there is abundant violence against women and the ease with which it's executed is truly illustrative of the soulessness of our villains.

I found this to be a well-composed, solidly executed film and lovers of cruelty and jaw-dropping violence will likely enjoy it.

This review was of the unrated director's cut, which was not available with English dubbing.  Surprisingly, the subtitles seemed poorly translated at times.  I won't explainit's no big deal, but you'll see what I mean unless you can follow the film in French.",1395964800,4,2892,5.149892933618844

3369695,1,B0014VPFVS,"Ok. 1st, the plot was really non-existant other than the fact they were a nazi family that eats people for food & serving their guests the same, hanging them up on hooks in a freezer. 2nd, in any evil situation, realistically there should have been NO LIMITS to any of the scenes, however this is the unrated version & it is cut & censored when it came to any love-making or scenes where nudity should have been a big issue. I mean these were some nice nazi's! They are so kind to kill & let the victims keep their clothes on while they are being slaughtered. Also there is a scene where the captured woman Yasmine is forced to sit while one of the nazi's family cuts off yasmine's hair, again all dressed & that is so unrealistic considering that the nazi's sent endless numbers of victims to their deaths in the freezing cold with no clothes, no hair & no hope. During the war with Hitler jews were sent to a place called THE SHOWERS WITH NO WATER after cutting off their hair. It was a very unsavory experience for the jews. So here we have nice nazi's, no rape scenes, (Yasmine is already pregnant by her boyfriend who dies) & the nice nazi's are good with that because they are looking for new blood in the family. There is no nudity, & the film is definetely one you can call grade B-low budget to say the least. So unless you are looking for a movie where the only thing that happens is watching clothed people being slaughtered then avoid purchasing this movie as it is certainly not worth the money. This is a true example of fiction created after the millenium. in this case, the movie was made in 2007 using a more societal expected setting, not a true realistic setting for a film. Just what you would expect from society as they think it is better to show less than more. Sorry society, but disney is your setting & the real world is not that nice.

3369721,4,B0014VPFVS,"Gotta hand it to the French, for they don't have the limiting filters that American filmmakers have to trudge through to make an appealing horror film- they just throw everything in.
Right after a round of French presidential elections strike heavy controversy, riots break out all over Paris, leaving a small group of anarchist friends to hightail it out of Paris with money they stole and get away from the police. Unfortunately, even this group of anarchists tend to get volatile on one another. It doesn't take long for that to get noticed. They split in groups and head out (for safety reasons, odd for anarchists) and one group end up at a little family-run inn. At first things seem normal... but then, this is a French horror film, so nothing's what it seems. And it quickly develops from there to a lot of heavy-hitting moments of heavy confusion and violence, chewing out, etc.
Then the next group comes in, and things get even more sinister. Things are hinted at (like how the family are not really French, but German neo-Nazis- hinted through what they talk about), things get obvious, and no punches are pulled.
Let me say this- if you are used to intelligence in a horror film, there's not an abundance here, yet it's a thought-provoking horror film nonetheless with its subtle themes and subthemes, heavy-lining insults that, unlike many American horror films I see anymore, actually fit rather well with the overall tone and atmosphere. The violence, as well, gets a very noticeable editing award from me. Heavy sadistic violence abounds, including extreme domestic violence (a woman, in one scene, gets kicked a few times in the stomach and a very hard foot-knock to her face, for instance), a man gets boiled by steam, another man gets his Achilles' tendon snipped (and it doesn't hold away from view of that), while there's a couple creatively explosive firefights and (what was to me the highlight of the violence) a very gruesome, cringe-worthy death by circular saw.
The editing team for this movie did an extremely good job at making it all seem hyper-realistic. I give them great credit for this.
Then comes the taboos of the film, like how it's never once mentioned, just hinted that the family are neo-Nazis and are called ""degenerates"" (and not in the typical American way of crudely insultive way, either), and even a hint of superstitious belief of an immaculate son (held by an ignorance of how one woman got pregnant anyway), not to mention a very vague hint that the family could be cannibals.
In other words, with all the hinted subthemes, the film covers many of the things Americans fear in a non-supernatural horror flick, and does it quite well.
If there's anything about this film, it's what felt like a brief lag in the exposition between the friends escaping Paris and the actual start of the torment in the inn for the first group of friends. Beyond that, I found this quite an enjoyable torture flick with a strong, thought-provocative storyline, evocative themes, and even a uniquely bittersweet ending that's open for thought.
For me to actually enjoy a torture film is entirely out there, since the only other torture films I've enjoyed were Saw, Saw 2, The Final, and Dread. No other torture films have managed to grab my attention thoroughly like those and this one.

I decided to check it out, because I love the After Dark Horrorfest series, and I read an article from BloodyDisgusting.com that called this Xavier Gens best film and that people that saw this were disappointed by The Divide (which I saw first). I feel like I should check whether or not that article was written on April Fool's Day.

So, first thing in my mind is the nazis. I think, at this point, nazis are sort of caricatures of bad guys; so, to make them scary, they have to be really well done, and this film fails at that. The history of the characters is barely touched, so it seems like the writer just said: We need villains. Ok, how about nazis? Yeah, that works, throw them in there.

Dramatically, the film is lacking. One thing I loved so much about The Divide was the emotion and relationship between characters. It feels like a pretty short time before we're left with just one hero, and the male lead is the not so charming ex-bf of the only female. I felt like the characterization could have been much better. The most interesting relationship of the film dies in maybe the first thirty minutes.

Too many unanswered questions: There are zombie/crawler characters in the film, but where did they come from? ...and there is one character that talks about not leaving her babies. Ahm...yeah, where are they? (Not in this film, that's for sure). Why are the characters running, in the first place? I didn't really understand why the characters were fleeing police.

These are the main reasons I gave this a three star rating. If the opinion of BloodyDisgusting.com is any indication, this film is grossly overrated.",1361145600,,1652,4.647260273972603

""Frontier(s)"" is a French horror film released on DVD as one of the ""8 Films to Die For"". I haven't been too impressed with that film line in the past, but occasionally, there is a good one, and this one is pretty good. It's not the most original film in the world. It largely plays out like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (with elements of ""Hostel"", of course, but way more like ""Chainsaw""), though it transforms a bit into a revenge flick towards the end too. The acting is great and there's some top notch gore, and I like the character of the much more pregnant girl, who was one of the family members and was pretty cute. She might have been a hunchback, but because she was pregnant I sometimes wasn't sure if that was why she was carrying herself like that.

3369745,3,B0014VPFVS,"Depending on what you've heard, Frontier(s) is either A.) a bloody masterpiece of French horror or B.) a derivative hodgepodge of cliches lifted from other horror films. I'm in the middle--no, it's not original or groundbreaking, and yes, it does borrow from a number of past films (although it doesn't attempt to hide its influences) in the genre but it is a blast and much better than most American horror films made today. At the end of the day, it's a well-made horror film with some great performances, a decent plot, some political subtext and extra helping of gore.

The film takes place in a possible future in France, in which an extreme right-wing government has taken control and riots take place in the street. Those familiar with current French politics will get more out of it than those who don't, as the film was made in response to riots that have taken place in the country recently. A group of thieves attempt to take advantage of the political climate, but things go wrong and they find themselves heading off to an inn for shelter... an inn that just happens to be run by Neo-Nazi cannibals. Needless to say, things get messy.

Frontier(s) isn't a deep film by any stretch of the imagination, but it works. All the actors are great in their respective roles and they take the film seriously as opposed to for camp. There really isn't a single bad performance in the film. The cannibalistic family is fantastic as well--there's a nice range of characters here, from some who are actually quite sympathetic to those who are nothing short of despicable. While I don't see this becoming a ""franchise"", I wouldn't mind seeing these characters and their histories explored elsewhere.

The film is pretty bloody but at the same time it's not unwatchable in its goriness. Nor is it particularly 'upsetting', like other French films in the genre. It's more of an intense, visceral thrill ride than anything that will leave you depressed. It's a pretty bleak film but it's not soul-crushing.

Unfortunately, the DVD presentation is... not so good. For starters, there are no special features whatsoever. The international release is apparently stacked with features, and LionsGate couldn't port over a commentary, a featurette and maybe some deleted scenes? It's frustrating that so many American releases of foreign films drop the ball in this area.

Even worse are the subtitles. It's like someone just ran the script through Google translate and didn't bother to actually consider how well it sounded to English readers. Example: One character calls another ""trash"", the subtitles read ""garbage can"". At another point, a character asks ""What are doing!"" For what it's worth, the film is still watchable and you'll still enjoy it, but there's still no excuse for this kind of sloppiness. Unfortunately, there are no real alternatives unless you own a Region-free DVD player. If you speak French fluently, there's a Blu-ray release in France that has no subtitles. I guess the best I can say is that at least this DVD gives you the option to turn off subtitles. Something you'd take for granted, but even that isn't guaranteed nowadays (see the Region 1 DVD of Thirst). Overall, the impression is that LionsGate just didn't give a damn, which is a shame. I'm guessing they thought that since it's a foreign film they didn't need to put any effort onto it and put out the cheapest possible disc possible.

I still give this disc my recommendation, albeit with some serious caveats. Take it as you will.",1317945600,,3513,4.876046901172529

There is a background story that is introduced in beginning and provides adequate reasoning for where they ended up. I found myself showing sympathy for these main characters in the film and that was unusual as well as nice for me. Usually in Saws and Hostels, you do not care about who dies, but with this I felt they did a great character development. There are plenty of high tension scenes that provide you with usually a bloody ending;) There is a particularly squirmish scene where two of the guys are crawling through a hole in the movie that was more bothersome than watching the descent.

That being said, I think the character development is actually better than I see in most horror films and is a nice change from the completely one dimensional characters and interactions you usually see in this sort of film.  The one off-note that I found a little annoying was the way the actress who played the main character tended to emote a combination of fear/shock/anger.  She frequently did this shaky, shuddery, Lou Gehrig's disease style thing that was often accompanied by a stiff legged jerky walk that looks like it came straight out of a zombie flick.  Every time I saw it, the screwiness of it jarred me out of the flow of the film for a little while.  Other than that she and the rest of the cast did a good job.",1280620800,,834,4.496688741721854

I watched the ""Frontier(s)"" when it came out on the DVD with the other ""After Dark Horrorfest"". At first I wasn't sure if I really wanted to watch it as most of the movies that come out under ""After Dark Horrorfest"" are nothing better than ""okay"".

""Frontier(s)"" is unlike any other film of those ""8 Films to Die For"" because it really is a good film. It has a solid production values and even thought the storyline is not the most original thing in the world, the movie still was very enjoyable. I highly recommend, it's one of those good modern day horror films.",1272153600,,673,4.471544715447155
3369757,5,B0014VPFVS,"The first time I watched ""Frontiers"", going in with these huge expectations, I was not only amazed (and somewhat appalled) at what I was watching, but how the film had surpassed the hype. I was genuinely shocked at what was unfolding before me. ""Frontiers"" is horrendous, but in a truly positive sense. It's hateful, and brutal, and violent, and anti-human. But I loved it! I was so happy I had bought the DVD from Amazon instead of renting it.

Last night I re-watched it with three of my friends, none of which had heard of the movie and who barely knew the plot other than what I vaguely explained while the commericials were rolling. At the end one of my friends was crying, and she couldn't even tell me why. Another said he didn't feel like doing anything, that he was emotionally-drained and felt like going to bed, while the last one said she felt ""weird"" and for the rest of the night remained silent. Without exaggeration... that's how powerful and gritty this film is.

Some bash it for being derivative of things such as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and even ""House of 1000 Corpses"", and while there are parallels and I cannot fault them for saying so, the movie does what it does very well (better than those three installments) and I think it was more of a homage to those other quality horrors.

It's fair to say when watching a movie with such a shock factor involved, things like acting and direction fall leeway; taking up the passenger seat and letting the violence lead. Such is not the case in ""Frontiers"". The acting on all levels is great, even stupendous in a few cases -- each character adding his or her own little bit to the story and cranking up the believability. Katrina Testa as Yasmine deserves mad props especially, during the film's second half her acting is just so raw and real you want to hug her and never let go.

The characterization is great. Before the craziness sets in the film devotes a good 30 minutes or so to acquainting us to the characters and really making you like them. This makes what eventually happens to them all the more devastating.

The cinematography is very crisp and fresh -- especially notable during the opening scene. It captures the bleak atmosphere of the film beautifully, to the rolling hills of the France-Luxembourg boarder to the depths of the Von Geisler chambers.

I feel like I'm rambling, and quite honestly I feel at the same time I have not written enough of how AWESOME this movie is.

All lengthy paragraphs aside, and if you can stomach brutality -- watch, buy, love ""Frontiers"".

3369758,3,B0014VPFVS,"I'm going to be totally honest, so you know where this review is coming from:

#1) I am not a fan of blatant movie remakes. When I say blatant, I mean anything that has the exact title of the old classic they are remaking, to the movie that changed the name, but rips off so much from another movie they might as well have called it a remake. This year's Frontier(s) is the latter.

#2) I do not like subtitles. It's not because I don't like to read, I just find that I am not experiencing the movie entirely because sometimes I am making the choice to either catch either the text or the visuals out of the corner of my eye as I focus on the other. I guess it would help if I just studied all the languages so I could watch movies without subtitles, but I'm just too lazy. Movie-dubbing usually doesn't do the trick either, so it's a lose-lose situation for me. Frontier(S) is a French flick, therefore it uses subtitles.

  Frontier(s) is a horror film that follows four criminals who rob something(they don't tell us what, but there's a big sack of money with them and the police are after them) during a series of political riots after a conservative regime takes over in Paris, France. They split up and flee to the country-side, and arrive at a hostel that, to their surprise later, is run by a family of cannibalistic Nazis, the leader of the family, Le Von Geisler, probably being ex-Gestapo. They find this out the hard way. Through a series of ordeals that brings new light to the term ""dog eat dog world"" and busloads of blood, the characters learn that even outside of society there is corruption and greed, and purity is in the eye of the beholder.

  The gore in this movie is exceptional. From a normal gun-shot blowing apart someone's hand to the beautiful use of a table-saw, the blood is strewn with a Frontier(s) bloody image shotgunheavy brush. It is so gruesome that the producer of the movie, After Dark Films, had to pull it from their After Dark Horrorfest series because of an NC-17 rating by the MPAA. It was either that or edit it a bit. I think they made the right choice.

  The story and symbolism is quite good too. Although it is a horror movie, it is an intelligent horror movie, besides the TCM rip-off, which I will get to later. Of course a Nazi would be hiding out in the middle of nowhere in France, having his family kill impure visitors and eat their flesh. Of course the family would be inbred. Of course the only law in the area happens to be the eldest son of the family, negating any sense of justice for outsiders. All of this, and it works. By the end of the movie, the farce that this family has concocted is just as real as the real world, where politicians are corrupt and using people to their whim. Heavy-handed? A bit, but at least it has more of a brain then the usual slasher movie.

  The problems of free use of elements from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre start once we get to the hostel, and they don't stop until close to the end. Instead of a feeble old man being fed at the dinner table(grandpa in TCM), we have the family's mother, who is actually spitting out the food(we find out what it is made of later on.) We also have the family police officer, the only law-man in this party of the country, blocking off the road to their house to make sure they don't have party-crashers as they hunt down these kids. He's like R. Lee Ermey from the TCM remake, without the comedic twist.

  The greatest massacre to a horror figurehead is Goetz, the French Leatherface of the film. He plays the executioner/butcher beautifully, but he acts way too much like Leatherface, even without a chainsaw. The most annoying point is when he is chasing two of the criminals in a car, yelling and squealing like a pig, just like Leatherface. The problem is, Goetz speaks fluent French, unlike Leatherface who can only grunt and squeal. It seems too forced. They could have Goetz looking like a wild dog without giving him a transcription of Leatherface monologues. Maybe I'm being too harsh.

  All in all, this movie is worth a rental at least. The political intrigue and human interaction are worth experiencing, as well as the buckets of blood",1263427200,,4186,4.454188481675392
3369759,4,B0014VPFVS,"after viewing the film...my thoughts were:  wow, this was a really good horror film.  The acting was very good, believable (especially the lead actress); the emotional tension / visual blood scenes / physical violence were mixed together well. I even liked the soundtrack, which fit perfectly to create a sense of unease.

the plot is somewhat reminiscent of the recent (2003) re-make of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". (Group of young people get trapped in an isolated area by a family of psychotics).  Also had a few plot elements of ""Hostel"".

I thought the various fight / conflict scenes between the characters was well-done- the sound effects, level of violence, and misery was felt at the gut-level as a viewer.

My only complaint:  the first part of the film (first 20 minutes) wasn't really needed, and could have been cut out of the film.  Rest of the film flows very well.

There seems to be a developing propensity from both audiences and industry folk to label anything that's ultra violent, horror.  There's nothing remotely unsettling or frightening about this film.  What we have is a solid thriller about a group of thugs that take advantage of civil unrest in Paris to commit some crimes and then leave the city, headed for the Belgian border and relative safety.  They come upon a desolate hostel that happens to be run by family whose patriarch is an elderly Nazi looking for a concubine to be broodmare for his psychotic heir.

3369770,3,B0014VPFVS,"Fronti&egrave;re(s) (Xavier Gens, 2007)

First off, can someone tell me what it is about the French and pregnant women? This is the fourth French horror film I remember seeing that deals directly with pregnancy. Second, why is it that, once again, I find that the more publicity a French movie got in America, the worse it is? Not that Fronti&egrave;re(s) is anywhere near as awful as, say, Haute Tension, but still, it's the kind of silly, derivative twaddle I'd expect from, well, Hollywood. (It's not a coincidence, I suspect, that director Xavier Gens was immediately imported to make the videogame-movie Hitman. Which should tell you all you need to know about Xavier Gens' directorial skills).

Fronti&egrave;re(s) draws about equally from American ""torture porn"" movies and the Canadian suspense flick Straightheads, though it desperately wants you to believe that its primary influence is Mathieu Kassovitz' La Haine. Here, we have a small band of Parisian radicals who have had to flee the city after one of them dies in custody. They all decide to rondezvous at a hostel somewhere outside the city. The first two find one and send the location on to the second batch before they realize that the place is run by some very nasty types who think the Vichy government is still in charge of France (and are quite happy with that). It doesn't help that these guys are Muslim... all of this sets up the arrival of main character Yasmine (Karina Testa), who tells them that she's looking for her friends...

I should say that there's nothing specific wrong with this flick. It's competently directed, competently acted, with the expected cast of young-and-beautifuls. My problem with Fronti&egrave;re(s) is that there's nothing overly right about it, either; this is a movie that steadfastly refuses to find anything new and interesting in the material it presents. If you're simply looking for a slasher flick with which to kill time, you could do worse than this one, but there are plenty of under-the-radar flicks of this stripe that do it better (may I suggest Turistas, if you haven't seen it yet?).  ** ",1238371200,2,2112,4.971671388101983

And I'm not talking about torture or sadism; though our villains are not very nice people, this film does not engage in the pleasure-in-cruelty that makes certain films (like Audition) unwatchable to me. It's certainly gory, but it's authentic, thoughtful and believable horror, with characters who aren't cyphers.

Ms. Testa out-Jolies Angelina Jolie in her beautiful-yet-grittily-real depiction of Yasmin, the fugitive who is the film's protagonist. With her beautiful and vulnerable face and Gallic passion of her character, Testa is amazing in what may well be the most physically demanding role I've ever seen an actress play. You have to see the film. It's not that she does a lot of stunt work, though there is enough of that. But you can feel the adrenaline coursing through her veins during this film and that's what makes her so effective.

Interesting and gripping French/Swiss horror thriller is one of the better horror imports of recent memory! The film does offer a little political subtext as one of the major subjects of the film including the idea of fascism and terrorism.

Luc Besson (""Leon"", ""The Fifth Element"") serves as one of the producers, this is definitely a worth while shocker that has guts literally and some good ideas.

Synopsis: a group of French young criminals are on the run after a heist while Paris burns during the 2005 riots that turned the French capital upside down for weeks. Traveling in separate cars, they decide to meet at a shabby hostel in the coutry... but the place is run by a family of sadistic killers led by an old Nazi.

Yes, it is gore galore.

The problem with these torture-porn films is that there isn't much story.  They just turn into a cat and mouse 90-minute journey where every three minutes there's an excuse to someone to lose limbs, the head, get cut, sawed to pieces, etc, etc, etc.

The good thing is that the journey here is made with great actors as the film shows a great cast of young French actors along with some familiar faces.

The bad thing is that the screenplay here copies from 100 other great (and not so great) films we've already seen. No, there isn't one single minute here that you can call original.

So here's the deal: great actors, great makeup, lots of gore... but there's nothing here we haven't seen before.

To make a long story short and in order to avoid giving too much away, let's suffice to say that all four end up in a miserable hotel in a remote area (and later in an abandoned mine) in the hands of cannibalistic nazis.
And blood will flow in rivers...

I am a big fan of FRONTIER(S). I have already watched it numerous times and of course there will be repeat viewings in weeks, months and years to come!
The movie is incredibly intense, with lots of atmosphere (like the creepy dinner scene, where the nazis toast to ""pure blood""). It makes excellent use of the run down locations and the nazi theme. Admittedly FRONTIER(S) is not the first backwoods splatter movie, but it is the combination of  various plot elements that make the story so original (the political subtext, pregnant heroine, gore galore, nazis). The film manages to be absolutely convincing and believeable due to Xavier Gens' assured direction. It never ever is campy or  trashy. The excessive bloodletting will appeal to all splatter fans, trust me on that!
And of course more intellectually minded viewers will have a heyday discussing the political subtext afterwards.
Actors deliver powerhouse performances and most have outstanding screen presence (especially Samuel Le Bihan as Goetz). I was particularly impressed with the gorgeous looking Estelle Lefbure as blonde nazi bitch Gilberte (given her looks I would not mind running the risk of landing on the dinner table) and Jean Pierre Jorris as head nazi Von Geisler. I also give kudos to Karina Testa as Yasmine in what must have been an exceptionally challenging role, both physically as well as emotionally. (Wait until you see her character's escape from the pigsty!)
It has been said that the gunplay in FRONTIER(S) is unfitting for a horror movie. Quite aside that firstly this is not the first horror film with gunplay (e.g. THE DEVIL'S REJECTS features lots of it) and secondly many other ways of inflicting mayhem and violent death (from steam chamber to axe and also including a hearty bite in the neck usually seen in zombie movies to mention just a few!) are graphically shown, I think that the shootouts are not only excellently choreographed and filmed, but also quite appropriate for the characters and the nazi theme. Von Geisler has a Luger handgun, Gilberte sprays bullets with a Schmeisser submachine gun, Junior nazi boss Karl shoots a German carabine and big Goetz even a light machine gun!
FRONTIER(S) is in my view however not without faults. I have two complaints:  The nazi father's few sentences in German (mostly well-known Third Reich slogans like ""Arbeit macht frei"")  are oddly accented and once or twice there are mispronounciations. Of course, this will  likely go unnoticed by international audiences, but as a native speaker of German I could not help notice it (okay, okay, I admit I am really nitpicking here). More grave is the occasional ultra-fast paced editing. I am no fan of  MTV-style editing. However it would be very unfair to emphasize these rather minor shortcomings, as these do in no way
diminish the impact of this exceptional horror fest.
Unfortunately there are no extra features on the DVD to speak of, just a couple of  admittedly very well made and interesting trailers - THE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN,  the new RAMBO movie, the excellent THE BACKWOODS  and rather fittingly, HIGH TENSION, the gory slasher film which started the new French horror wave a couple of years ago (by the way, check out the last two movies, I have seen both of them and can assure you that you won't be disappointed with them).

FRONTIER(S) comes with this reviewer's highest possible recommendations. Every self-respecting gorehound and splatter fan needs this DVD in his collection. Do yourself a favour and buy it. NOW !",1217289600,,4191,4.922096317280453
3369785,4,B0014VPFVS,"I ordered this movie along with Inside.  Inside was insane, and completely lived up to it's hype.  I loved it.  I was definatley looking even more forward to viewing Frontier(s), as it wasn't even released for rental in the U.S.  This I took as either a bad sign (wouldn't make any money in theatres, which is typical of horror films anyway) or it was an excellent sign (too graphic for open public consumption.)  When it came and I saw it, I admitt, I did feel a little disappointed, but it's definately not a bad movie either.  Production quality is top notch, and acting is very decent, excluding a bit of which could be considered overacting by our heroine, Yasmine (Spasmic convulsions overcome her within the last 10 minutes of the movie that are a little unbelievable.)  But with all of the hype that came from this boy, I expected something a little more manly. Not damn bad, but nothing I havn't seen before.  I will give the movie four stars for the most climactic, and original killing I have seen in awhile, including an axe, a shoulder, a table saw, and a solarplex.  Enjoy, plenty-o-blood, but a TON! of borrowing, watch some well produced and interesting twists, while calling out over a dozen movies this was inspired by.  One thing is for sure, this string of new French extreme gore films has got me captivated, watch out for the renound film by Pascal Laugier ""Martyrs"" coming to the U.S. sometime soon... hopefully!",1215993600,2,1435,4.658730158730159
3369786,2,B0014VPFVS,"Weird, crazy movie. Started out slow. You've got Nazi's, zombie kid, cannibals, one brave herroine, a bunch of gore and not a whole lot of it makes any sense.",1215302400,3,158,4.482758620689655
3369787,3,B0014VPFVS,"In the sixties a group of young directors from France led what was called the new wave of motion pictures. Names like Godard and Truffautt led the way using new techniques and making cinema something different. A current new wave of French directors are out to make a name for themselves as well, but this time around they are adding something different to an already familiar genre. The new French wave revolves around horror films. Their takes have been seen recently in films like HIGH TENSION and INSIDE. Now we have FRONTIER(S).

The one thing that may make this movie more of a challenge than most is that it definitely loses something in the translation. While many of us are aware of what goes on politically in other countries, we don't know the details, much as other countries don't know the same about us. This film begins with the political riots in France and a group that loots and then hits the road.

One of them has been shot and his sister, Yasimine, insists they stop at a hospital.  Dropped off along with Alex, Yasmine waits and watches as her brother dies. The other pair, Tom and Farid, keep going with the intent of meeting up with them later.

When their car begins to run low on fuel and they tire, Tom and Farid stop at a country inn with hopes of a food and a place to stay. What they get in return is much more than they bargained for. At first approached by two young women who work there, they are later attacked and discover that this inn is nothing more than a home for a group of cannibalistic killers. Too late, they're caught and tortured.

Yasmine and Alex find their way to the inn after leaving the hospital. They are greeted much like their friends were. When Tom and Farid are nowhere to be found, the pair is captured as well. Imprisoned, Yasmine is given an exemption from being tortured as the group has other plans for her. Having scraped the bottom of the gene pool among this limited group, she has been chosen to bring fresh blood in.

As the film progresses, we learn that the leader of this tribe is an ex-Nazi who escaped here after the war. Still strutting around in his best brown shirt outfit, he rules the roost like the dictator he worshipped. Yasmine, who is already pregnant, does her best to escape. But does she? You'll have to watch and see.

The biggest thing to be said about this new wave of French horror is that it takes the most brutal of what has been seen in the genre and turns it up a notch. Torture seemed to take on its own fan base with the film HOSTEL. Those same fans will love what they see here. Gougings and slices are found throughout. The blood flows freely and the bad guys and good guys alike fall like bowling ball pins at different points in the film.

I'd heard so much about this movie before seeing it. RUE MORGUE magazine hailed it as one of the best horror films in years. But to me it was nothing more than a continuation of the torture films that seem to proliferate these days, imposing bloodletting for real horror or chills. The creepiest part of the film was the malformed children of one of the crazies that hide in the tunnels on their land. These are truly scary looking creatures shown only in night vision. Sadly, they are used very little and yet were the one thing that caught my attention. I would have liked to see more or learned more about them.

On the whole, this movie should be considered a ground breaker as the French are not a group to embrace horror films according to the directors of INSIDE. Perhaps that is why they have chosen to pay more of homage to the retro days of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE HILLS HAVE EYES with films like this one. But the fresh takes offered show that there is new blood being pumped into the genre, and either the French will take it over or inspire others to do the same and bypass the Hollywood remake syndrome that seems to have taken over.",1214524800,,3894,4.404728789986092
3369788,4,B0014VPFVS,"now the last week i have been watching a lot of french movies, mostly horrors. some thrillers as well, like gaspar noe's revenge drama irreversible, plus his movies where we follow a french horse meat butchers life in paris ""i stand alone"" and ""carn"". what struck me though is how much i enjoy french horror. movies like ""ils"", ""l'interieur"", ""haute tension"" and to some degree ""calvaire"". and now ""frontier(s)""  which was next to l'interieur and haute tension as my favorite one. in an age where most american horrors fail to intrigue me (with exceptions like aja's the hills have eyes remake and perhaps frailty), and a lot of asian horrors include the same white dressed black haired ghouls. france is breathing life into horror. frontier(s) sets off with 5 young thieves fleeing paris during the riots, one of them has been shot and is begging the others to take him to the hospital. so the group split up, 2 is taking him to the hospital while the other 2 is fleeing with the money. to later meet up outside of paris. the latter come across an inn in a rural part of france , where they are told that they can stay the night for free. soon what started as fleeing from the police in paris and jail sentences, ends up as fleeing from cannibalistic neo nazis for their lives. some have said that it borrows heavily from other movies, well it's not the most creative movie i have seen. yet it got a lot going for it with sympathic characters. some cool visuals and leaving you with the feeling that you really want the victims to escape this. (i'm usually rooting for the killers). some stand out details and a great atmosphere through out. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will most likely re-watch it over and over again. (the movie suggest a lot instead of showing wounds and carvings, but it does it in such way that it doesn't leave me feeling like i'm watching a ""disney horror"" and you do get to see tendons cut!=goodie) i recommend it for horror fans, not for the rest",1213574400,,1981,4.533519553072626
3369789,1,B0014VPFVS,"To say that this French thriller is derivative would be a compliment. FRONTIERES follows a road map of other previous films. It travels from RESERVOIR DOGS Place down PSYCHO Lane as five (soon to be four) friends escape Paris with a duffel bag full of cash. There's a signpost up ahead. It reads ""FRONTIERES"" with an arrow pointing right to HOSTEL and one pointing to the left to TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (in little letters below that it says ""the remake""). A little on up the road there's a detour marked THE DESCENT. All of these places are in the idyllic French countryside in the county of HAUTE TENSION.

Throw in a Nazi war criminal as a patriarch, some terrifically hot girls, and a few thuggish brutes and you've got all the makings of the next Rob Zombie film. I was casting the American remake in my head as the events of FRONTIERES predictably unfolded.

What hurts this flick (other than all the obvious ripping off of other flicks that came before it and have been done and re-done to death by now) is the fact that I, as a viewer, did not give a damn about anyone in this gorefest. I mean it did not bother me one bit what the McVictims were put through.

Most of these horror flicks coming out of France just don't seem to work. What's going on? Looks like they had a budget and a decent crew. What happened? Why is this genre effort such a dud?

I guess there is always Joe Spinell's Maniac, John McNaughton's Henry, the 1974 TCM, the original When A Strang Calls...

 And, oh yeah, not only are the actors  in Frontiers ugly to look at physically, but their behavior is ugly (to the bone.) Look, even that wouldn't turn someone off to a horror film, after all, these films are SUPPOSED TO HORRIFY, are they not? Trouble is we never get to know anyone here. The camera (read writer/director) never spends enough time with any of the people (good or bad) in his film & the result is we just aren't moved in any way whatsoever.

3369794,3,B0014VPFVS,"After reading Woopak's review, I'd defer to a number of his descriptions of the movie, and agree with his assessment of the film. There is relatively little here that is new, and calls to mind a number of torture/revenge/exploitation films of the 70's, and the more recent Haute Tension and Hostel franchise. It is notable that all these flicks had an element of social commentary hidden beneath the violence, and Frontiers is no different.

The film's backdrop of the election of a neo-conservative president and the surrounding riots it creates gives context to the characters we get to know as they flee the police after a bank robbery and head for the border. There is even a reference to America (not unusual in French films) that they have elected ""our own George Bush."" It is not surprising then that when our band of anti-heroes find an isolated hostel as a meeting point that the proprietors are indeed Nazis intent on preserving the purity of their race.

The violence in the film is cruel, repetitive, and palpable, and there is some originality to the gory scenes, though I'll admit growing a bit jaded about how creative movie makers can make deaths more gruesome. For me, perhaps the most captivating scene involved little blood, but had two characters trapped in a long, narrow tunnel, attempting to find a way out. It was tense, claustrophobic, and expressed a sense of urgency other than the cringe you experience when a character is horribly mutilated or murdered (again, not terrbly new, considering the Descent captured that mood throughout the film).

There is certainly some pleasure in the vengeful aspect of the film as our heroin exacts her own revenge upon her tormentors, and there is plenty of reason to despise the captors. The cavernous structures beneath the hostel provide ample room for a few impressive chase scenes and unique settings for some to experience their demise.

Overall, this does not add anything new to the genre, but it does take much of what has been done in other films, gives them a twist, and recreates it in a different setting. That is not necessarily a bad thing, and if you are a fan of the torture/revenge flicks, this will certainly not disappoint.",1212624000,,2207,4.846153846153846

The MPAA, rightfully I might add, stamped Frontier(s) with an NC-17 rating, prompting the distributor to shoot for a limited American unrated theatrical release coinciding with this release on DVD.  This is a French film and given that I felt the French horror film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside/dp/B00125WATQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside</a>&nbsp;was among the best horror films to come out in quite some time, my hands were wet with anticipation to see this little movie.  The comparisons to Inside are undeniable as it is not only French and violent to the extreme, but its protagonist is pregnant and the film is set among the chaos of French riots and civil unrest.  There was a message hinted at in spurts during Frontier(s) but the film was just too vile to place emphasis on Gens's political leanings.

Frontier(s) follows a gang of thieves who exploit law enforcement during riots to commit a pretty hefty heist.  The robbery is botched and the gang of four splits up.  The gang ends up in some rural hostel that turns out to be a hive of Neo-Nazi cannibal kidnappers and torturers.  Let the fun begin.

One thing is for sure, the story is not original at all.  In fact, it is very formulaic and I didn't like the fact that I felt urged to side with this gang of thieves, so I rooted for Goetz, a character who is an absolute monster of a villain and made for some entertaining and intense moments.  Considering that we are seeing nothing new here and we may wonder why we're being shown these kinds of events in the first place, this was done pretty well.  I liked the atmosphere in most scenes and the feeling of suspense was pretty strong when it needed to be.  The acting was not good but it was definitely better than most films of this ilk.  The thing I liked about this movie most is that it didn't pull punches and definitely should not have.  That is kind of the point of horror films and it is probably the reason the other HorrorFest films don't work as well as this does.  Frontier(s) is to After Dark Films' ""8 films to die for"" as Takashi Miike's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Imprint/dp/B000GI3RHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Imprint</a>&nbsp;was to Showtime's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masters-of-Horror/dp/B000RIWAV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masters of Horror</a>, meaning that it was initially rejected but is probably more true to the horror genre than the accepted works were to begin with.

There were some legitimately grueling scenes that pushed my boundaries in terms of comfort.  So, as a modern horror film it worked pretty effectively and I give it a mixed review leaning toward a slight recommendation.

3369796,2,B0014VPFVS,"I really can't believe how people keep raving about how great this moving is.  Don't get me wrong, I am a big horror fan.  I enjoy Horror films because I'm kind of a sick-o and I like movies that don't take themselves  too seriously.  That being said, however, I wasn't too big on Frontier(s).  It is NOT 5 star material, even for a horror film.  I mean, I'd steal it from a friend to watch on a rainy day with nothing better to do, but the $15 I paid for this supposed masterpiece was not worth it.

Firstly, let me start off by addressing the gore in this movie, which seems to be one of its main selling points.  I was pissing myself with excitement when I found out Frontier(s) had made NC-17 for violence and gore.  That is, until I watched it.  I cannot see how this movie did not make it under an R rating.  The violence and gore in this movie PAILS in comparison to SAW and Hostel, both much better franchises.  This movie came off as a French version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (which sucked by the way).

Secondly, the direction and editing bothered me the whole time. The way the movie was edited had a very choppy, self aware, look-at-me-I'm-be-so-artsy vibe to it that it totally took you out of the mood of the film.

Lastly, I just want to say that I am really, really sick of watch horror movies where the whole plot of the movie is kidnapped strangers put in easily escapable situations only to be chased around for half an hour with no suspense to be almost shot and then miraculously escape again because of sheer luck.  There was twice in this movie where a gun was pointed strait at somebody point blank and the only reason the person holding the gun doesn't take the shot because that would prevent the movie from be dragged out for another 30 minutes.

Frontier(s) just doesn't live up to the hype, it doesn't live up to its NC-17 gore rating, it doesn't  bring anything new to the horror genre, and to top it off is annoyingly self aware and self gratifying.  Only see this only if you can get it for free or for cheep.

Especially if you're a longtime horror fan who's been beaten down(but not defeated!) by the lack of worthwhile genre titles released since the new millenium... and surprisingly, unlike any other moment in the history of the world up until now, France of all places, has decided to swoop in and save the day!  Frontier(s) is the newest French import to arrive in America, and oddly enough featuring the After Dark Horrorfest slogan plastered all over it(I say ""odd"" because normally the label is saved for some of the most awful films currently being dropped on the horror masses... not usually something this promising).  It tells the tale of a group of city ""folk""(n'er do well teens) who end up getting mixed up with the wrong batch of country ""folk""(inbred Nazi scum)... hijinx ensue!

It's a good point(depressingly enough), and although I would have preffered more creativity, at least in Gens hands the material is respectfully well done(like the rest of the recent ""French invasion"" of fear flicks, acting, sound, direction, and effects are all top notch).  Ultimately, Frontier(s) lacks originality and many real scares... but it's gritty, depraved, and trashy(not to mention gory!) enough to keep you entertained to the grisley end(even if you are fighting a nagging sense of Deja Vu throughout most of it).",1210982400,,1911,4.87962962962963
3369800,3,B0014VPFVS,"I've watched a fair share of more recent French horror films; ""Them"" (not the one with ants), ""High Tension"" and ""Inside"". Amazon friends Dave K and Puzzlebox have rated this film highly (I recommend reading their reviews) and of course, I have to see it or myself. I`ve read that ""Frontier(s)"" was left out at the recent ""After Dark Horror Fest"" because of its very violent nature and its NC-17 rating; thankfully, LIONSGATE have released the unrated version to sit side by side with its other ""Horrorfest"" counterparts. Director Xavier Gens is at the helm of this film; while I'm not particularly very familiar with his work, save for the video-game inspired movie ""Hitman"". If this film is once again ANY indication, the French movie scene may be really into ""stunt gore shows"".

Rioting and civil unrest breaks out all over Paris after a right-wing government is elected. Amidst all the turmoil, a bank robbery goes awry for a group of a young gang of thieves including reluctant thief Yasmine (pretty Karina Testa), who is also 3 months pregnant (?). Her brother has been fatally wounded and the gang separated, so they agree to meet in an isolated hostel by the frontier. Once in the hostel, the group would fall victim one by one to its psychopathic owners. With this plot, horror lovers should figure out what would come next in the film.

First off, ""Frontiers"" is lacking a lot of originality. An obese butcher with a mother who seems moments away from death, an imbalanced young lady, a muscled psycho (played by Brotherhood of the Wolf's Samuel Le Bihan), a psychopathic father who is also an ex-Nazi, an even psychopathic son/heir to a psycho family and loose women who seduce and flirt; oddball characters that have always been the clich for a lot of films that have the seal of ""torture porn"". The film offers nothing--absolutely nothing in terms of plot and originality; it borrows formulas from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Hostel"", ""The Descent"", ""The Hills have Eyes"" and ""Wrong Turn"". So just what does this film offer horror fans? A lot of blood, violence and GORE.

""Gore for the sake of gore"" is actually scary when done right. This film is not a lost cause, since it does have a lot of visceral impact. ""Frontiers"" is a well-made film on a visual standpoint. While I do think there was one scene done in bad taste; the atmosphere, shaky camera work, quick edits and eerie close-ups do add a lot to exhibit the film's violent nature. The film is genre film and the villains are too cardboard for my taste. If this was a video game, this film would be classified under ""survival horror"" and it does do it very well. It exhibits the fierce and unrelenting brutality with a lot of visual impact. The gore effects look rather realistic but still retains that somewhat ""campy"" look.

Most of the characters are ""wooden"", ex-boyfriend Alex (Aurelien Wilk), Tom (David Saracino) and shy Farid (Chems Dahmani) are the embodiment of true clich, their fate would come as no surprise. However, Karina Testa was quite impressive with her performance as Yasmine, she portrays her character with convincing fervor that would make the viewer say: ""OMG, she`s in shock, on the verge of collapse"". Although, her survival skills may require a suspension of disbelief, aided by the usual movie fakery, all the villains have such bad aim when it comes to shooting the heroine. Yasmine dodges automatic gunfire, a shotgun and a pistol from a very close distance. This oversight greatly stretches the film's credibility and realism. I am also somewhat disappointed that the ""dwellers of the old mine"" weren't thoroughly explored. Seemed like they were just there to exhibit some creepiness.

Overall, ""Frontier"" is a blood-soaked affair that is solid in execution, decently acted (man, you'll be disturbed by the creepy father) and saved by the performance of its heroine. Of course, she had to resort to animal ferocity which is both shocking and sympathetic at the same time. There is a lot of sequences of sheer cruelty and the film definitely knew where it wanted to go, at least the reasons behind it all is NOT without viability, but the reason themselves are VERY FAMILIAR. It may not be the goriest film you'll ever see, but it is grisly, gruesome, atmospheric and visceral that excels in the ""torture for the sake of torture"" style but unfortunately it just didn't explore all its potential. This film is not for the faint of heart.

Recommended to hardcore horror fans and a good rental to everyone else. [3 Stars]

3369801,4,B0014VPFVS,"Since 2003 movies dealing with some form of torture have made a pretty big comeback; back in the 60s through the early part of the 80s these kinds of movies were rather popular before some what fading away. But since 2003 these movies are coming back and the major difference is these flicks are now mainstream rather than cult. Frontiers is the latest torture flick, this one out of France.

While as a whole I enjoyed I can't help, but think if this was an American movie it would probably get more heat. Frontiers takes a little bit of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (original or remake) and takes a whole lot of Hostel as well as other exploitation inspired movies. The fact this movie is French and not American it won't be seen by as big of an audience in the States; I think Frontiers is an excellent movie, but I can't help, but think some of the praise is due to it not being American. Frontiers, while it is enjoyable really has nothing original to be found.

Frontiers is quite twisted, but hardly as shocking as it's made out to be for those who know their exploitation cinema whether it be the old school or the newer ones I doubt this one will shock you much unless you are easily shocked. With that said though of all the recent hash of 70s inspired exploitation flicks, Frontiers would probably rate as one of the better ones. Making a movie like this isn't as easy as most people think it is. The common belief is torture people in the most brutal of ways and that's it.

I personally think there is more to it than that. The biggest problems movies like this often suffer from are characters who really aren't all that sympathetic and villains who are way too likeable. When the villains start spitting out one-liners they become too likeable. Thankfully Frontiers avoids that, but there is still a problem with the characters not being sympathetic.

Writer Xavier Gens does a pretty good job with the script, while the characters lacked depth and untimely weren't all that sympathetic I suppose what they go through makes up for their lack of depth and sympathy. The basic idea behind the script is your run of the mill backwoods killer movie. Like I said it takes a little bit of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a lot of Hostel just without the comedy. The script is dark, which is good and the villains are just that.

Xavier Gens also directs and is able to put together some fairly good suspense scenes and is able to keep the pace moving forward for the most part. Frontiers received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA and people talk about how gory it is. Actually, Frontiers really wasn't that gory with the exception of the power saw scene and the amazingly awesome shotgun blast to the head. Besides that the gore isn't very extreme it's just the movie has constant violence. Sometimes a movie can be so dark and mean spirited people tend to think it was gorier than it actually was. Frontiers has gore, but only 2 scenes of extreme gore.

Xavier Gens does a solid job though; he takes a very clichd movie and makes it much better than maybe it should have been. Frontiers isn't as shocking as one might lead you to believe, but it does have some very dark and twisted scenes and Gens delivers one of the better torture flicks of the decade.

The only problem is the movie does tend to run a bit longer than it needed to be. Without closing credits Frontiers runs at about 104-minutes and it easily could have been wrapped up in 90-95-minutes. Despite running longer than it needed to the pacing never really lags too much. While the excitement level might drop a little it never gets boring.

Overall Frontiers is a well-made and enjoyable movie; despite the clichs, which are many the movie works well and again is one of the better recent hash of torture flicks.",1210636800,7,3785,4.523391812865497
3369802,5,B0014VPFVS,"By the time ""Frontier(s)"" was over my teeth really hurt.  That was because I kept clenching them during the moments in this French horror film (the correct spelling of which would be ""Frontire(s)"").  This 2007 film is being promoted as the ninth of the 8 films 2 die 4 for last year's After Dark Horrorfest, because when it earned an NC-17 rating in the States it had to be pulled from the lineup.  So it has the whole vibe of being too much horror for Horrorfest, which means the expectations are pretty high when you sit down to watch this one.  On the other hand, the second crop of Horrorfest films were rather disappointing so you figure this one has to be an improvement, and the good news is that it certainly delivers.  I am not the sort to close my eyes while watching the gory parts of movies (although I did close one of them in sympathetic reaction to the opening game of ""Saw II""), which is why I went the clenched teeth part.  A bad case of the measles as a child took out some of the calcium in my permanent teeth, so I am surprised some of them did not crack.

France is in the throes of some political upheaval having to do with the election of a hard line government, and while a century ago this might have sent young people to the barricades, in these trouble times they turn to crime.  With the cops on their trail they decide to hole up in this filthy little bed and breakfast.  This, of course, turns out to be a really bad mistake, and while the victims are not deserving of our sympathy on the basis of their characters, they are the hope of the future compared to their tormentors.  There is really nothing more to say in laying out the plot, because you should just enjoy the ride, if you sense of the word ""enjoy"" encompasses what happens in this film.  The film breaks down into three acts and how much you like the movie will probably come down to whether you think the final act tops the second.

Writer-director Xavier Gens (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hitman/dp/B0012RLX8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hitman</a>"") gets the credit for coming up with all this sick stuff, but credit also goes to cinematographer Laurent Bars, who gives the film is visual style, and especially film editor Carlo Rizzo, who crafts some moments of bizarre beauty through his creative use of montage.  A few horror films of recent vintage have attempted to be ""arty,"" and ""Frontier(s)"" certainly has some moments where you can argue it is cinema rather than just a horror movie.

The obvious cinematic touchstone here is supposed to be ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>,"" but I was reminded more of the original version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>.""  You will pick up echoes from a lot of other films, but it speaks to the film that I never got the feeling this was a pastiche.  I still think ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolf-Creek/dp/B000EOTVU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolf Creek</a>"" is at the top of the list for the torture-porn genre, although I am sure I have not seen everything that is out there.  But ""Frontier(s)"" is closer to that than it is to the ""Hostel"" movies or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Saw-Trilogy/dp/B000UO4F8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Saw Trilogy</a>,"" where there are mystery element in play that divert your from the blood, guts, and whatnot.  This is just one of those bloody movies where you wait to see if anybody is going to get out alive.

All I can say now is: What a difference a movie makes.  ""Frontier(s)"" was replaced in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horrorfest-2007-lineup/dp/B0012RCNDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horrorfest 2007 lineup</a>&nbsp;by ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unearthed/dp/B00127RAIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unearthed</a>,"" which means that what would have been my highest rated one of the 8 films 2 die 4 was replaced by the one I rated the lowest (although you have to grant that they were right not to have included ""Unearthed"" in the first place).  The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original-Horrorfest-lineup/dp/B000NA6C1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original Horrorfest lineup</a>&nbsp;earned an average rating of 3.7 from me and this year's were a step lower at 3.0; but replace ""Unearthed"" with ""Frontier(s)"") and the average jumps to 3.4.  I had sworn that next year I would rent the Horrorfest movies rather than go ahead and buy them when they came out on DVD (we did not get the festival the second time around), but I am glad I saw enough of the buzz about ""Frontier(s)"" to go ahead and pick it up.  The only real complaint is that there are no DVD extras.  Final Note: I wonder if the people behind the After Dark Horrorfest have noticed that their best flicks are being made in foreign lands, because that's certainly what has happened so far.",1210550400,46,5245,5.593434343434343
3369803,3,B0014VPFVS,"Despite all the good things I had heard about Frontier(s), I approached with caution pretty much based on the fact that it carries the After Dark Horrorfest banner, which a majority of those films were, to say it lightly, not very good.  However, Frontier(s) still seemed promising, and while it is a very interesting and bloody French horror film, there really isn't much here to make it memorable.  Directed by Hitman helmer Xavier Gens, Frontier(s) follows four friends fresh off robbing a bank, and running afoul of a family of cannibalstic Neo-Nazi's (yes, you read that right).  You can guess where things go from here, as Frontier(s) proves to be nearly every bit as predictable as any horror fan can guess it to be, and the lack of characterizations don't help matters here either.  However, despite what would be some otherwise fatal flaws, Frontier(s) delivers the goods in terms of gore effects and tension; of which are worth checking this film out for alone.  Compared to other French splatter fests, most notably Alexandre Aja's High Tension and more recently Inside, Frontier(s) doesn't offer up anything new or original, but it manages to provide the goods that films of this type promise, and in that respect alone, the film is worth a look for horror buffs and gore hounds alike.",1210464000,2,1297,4.904109589041096
3369804,5,B0014VPFVS,"Saw this tonight on DVD and thought it was damn good. Sadly, though, this is the only AfterDark flick that I would ever suggest renting as all the others that I have seen [] to infinity! This didn't even really seem to fit the ADHF line-up as it was very well-made and actually enjoyable and scary and gross as all hell! I watched the Unrated DVD and it certainly lived up to that! LOADS of gore and guts and awesome F/X! I have never seen a better, more beautiful blood-soaked actress than the French girl in this movie. She was amazing! There was just 'something' about the way she looked, hair cut short, wearing that strange 'wedding' dress, wielding a large axe and an even larger pick-axe DRENCHED in blood that made me feel giddy. I really got into her character and believed in her and wanted her to get sweet revenge on those sick, sick Neo-Nazi-cannibal freaks. The movie didn't seem at all contrived as one would expect. The evil, demented characters were frighteningly 'real' and these types of monsters could very well be living among us and probably are! Anyway, I cannot rave enough about the girl who played the lead role of Yasmine. She should get a horror Oscar! The way all of the characters, evil and innocent, were killed was, for lack of a better word, great! The deaths seemed to 'fit' the story well, without seeming too phony-baloney. I found myself anxious and excited and saying 'Get up! Run! GO! Fight! Kick his []! Kick her []!' when Yasmine would get smacked and punched and knocked to the ground and shot at but she always fought back, even though she was exhausted and screaming and weak, and I was totally rooting for her all the way! There was only one very small moment in the film that left me scratching my head: When the 2 male friends get run off the side of the road and end up entering the old mine they end up crawling into a hole in the wall and one of them can see light at the other end. The first guy to enter the hole was the blond guy and the bald friend followed behind him. At one point the bald guy (using his small digital camcorder for light) turns back to look down the passge that they are crawling through and see what looked to me like some evil, scary demon faced creature head with glowing eyes coming up behind them. He starts screaming for his friend to GO! GO! GO! but I was never really sure what it was he saw. I kept rewinding that scene and could not figure out what the hell that thing was. And the story never touched on it again. Was it one of the weird mutant 'children' kept in the mines? Was it a giant rat monster? Does anyone have any idea? Anyway, SEE THIS MOVIE! Hooray, Frenchies! Keep making great, gory goodness!",1210032000,6,2691,4.373253493013972
3369805,5,B0014VPFVS,"When this made the top ten of 2007 on BloodyDisgusting.com I was fervently trying to find some way to find it.  I looked for months.  I kept hearing how brilliant it was.  Usually when I put a lot of time into finding something that I know so relatively little about, it ends up in a huge letdown.  This absolutely broke that rule.  Some nice viscera gets sprayed around, but the compelling acting and character nuances are what really sink the hooks in deep when the blood starts flying.  There's a shaky camera technique that gets irritating only a little bit during some driving sequences, but overall the production and the director's sensibility are sharp.  I'd describe it as having some classic 70s and 80s horror trappings (cannibals, nazis, freaks, backwoods family) that are wrapped up in a nice art-house package.

I can see the similarities to Texas Chainsaw Massacre that people point out, but I think it stands on it's own and I feel the TCM comparisons are tangential at most. Xavier Gens gets great performances from all the actors, and definitely sets a creepy, grimy tone for the movie. If you like movies with body horror, political under-tones, and where Neo-Nazi's get their comeuppance....this is a great movie. The only thing that keeps it from getting a 5-star review from me is that it does lose a little (but definitely not a lot) of its impact on repeat viewings.
