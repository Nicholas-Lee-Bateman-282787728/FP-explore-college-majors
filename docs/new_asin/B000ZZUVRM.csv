I only started watching NASCAR a few years before his death, but I was always intrigued about the man they call The Intimidator, and I think this DVD more than covered what I missed out on.  I watched the documentary in its original run on CMT last September, even recorded it, but when I heard that they were coming out with a 6-disc collector's edition I knew it would be worth it and I just had to buy it.

The only thing I was in the dark about when it came to wanting to buy this disk, though, was what the extras actually were.  They were well worth it, I thought. Here they are by disc:

Disc 1 - The documentary
Disc 2 - Deleted Scenes, bloopers, extras, an alternate beginning and ending, interviews with the man himself, etc.
Disc 3 - The full 2000 Winston 500, which was of course, Dale's last race.  This also includes commentary with Richard Childress, which I believe is actually on a condensed version of the race.
Disc 4 - Dale-Tona: Shows the highlights of his 1986, 1990, 1997, and 1998 efforts.  The thing I love about it, especially '98, is how it comes in its original format, as in it comes with the CBS logo, the graphics, etc. A lot of times when they have a race on DVD it cuts a lot of that out, but it's still intact on here, which is just a little thing that enhances the viewing experience.
Disc 5 - A photo gallery, and a 20-minute documentary, ""The Making of DALE.""  The photo gallery is especially nice, because again, it's not like something that is on a lot of DVD's where it's just pictures and you scroll through, but it has background music and transitions between the pictures.  The documentary is pretty cool too.
Disc 6 - The full version of the 1998 Daytona 500, with a separate condensed version which has all the major two-way audio that occurred during the race between Earnhardt and his team.

And the case itself is packed, with a print-out of an actual '98 Daytona 500 ticket and the full results/point standings.  Another nice touch.

Very well done, and it was really the truly the way it should have been completed...",1215475200,30,2236,4.374396135265701
3044579,5,B000ZZUVRM,I bought my dad this for Christmas because he is still a huge fan. He cried.,1214956800,,76,3.8125
3044580,5,B000ZZUVRM,"Some pro athletes transcend their sport. Take, for example, pro basketball's Shaquille O'Neal and Larry Bird, pro soccer's Mia Hamm and Pele, hockey's Wayne Gretzky and Jaromir Jagr, baseball's Alex Rodriguez and Hank Aaron, and football's Brett Favre and Walter Payton.  A short list from the world of racing would include Mario Andretti, Jimmie Johnson, Richard Petty and the late NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt.

This is Earnhardt's story: he knew what he wanted, he worked hard to get it and, as a result, he became a champion, the face of NASCAR and a sports legend.  But don't let that brief synopsis satisfy any curiosity you may have about ""Dale"", the film or person.  Why?  You'd regret not seeing this movie.

Now, I'd seen the ""Barry Pepper incarnation"" of Earnhardt in the ESPN movie based on Earnhardt's life ""3: The Dale Earnhardt Story"".  For character acting...in telling the story of a well-known sports figure based on facts pretty well known by anyone who's paid NASCAR any attention over the last 20 years, it was ok.

The film ""Dale"" is a documentary, albeit a well told story narrated by actor/racing enthusiast Paul Newman that's compellingly conveyed with archived television coverage of Earnhardt's races, and old photos which are key to telling his dad's story.  What hooked me, though, were the interviews with Earnhardt's friends, his peers within the racing world, and his family.  To me, these conversations tell ""The Intimidator's"" real story.

I learned that Earnhardt had once said that his greatest regret was his not taking up his dad's offer to buy Dale a brand new car if Dale'd just finish high school.  That was quite an offer from a man that supported his family by racing North Carolina's dirt tracks.  Dale quit school, any way, to focus on racing. Then his dad, Ralph, died suddenly at age 45.  He died before seeing the payoff for his son's inherited passion, and determination, to be first on race day: the driver of the #3 car's ascension to becoming a renowned NASCAR racing champion.

The film frame's Earnhardt's life and career with breaks to CBS Sports' coverage of the 1998 Daytona 500; a race day that, going into it, felt to driver and race team alike to feel a bit different...race day feelings symbolized by a penny glued to the dashboard of Earnhardt's #3 car...feelings about a race for which he'd already used 19 different ways to lose.",1204675200,,2393,4.874074074074074
3044581,4,B000ZZUVRM,"This was hard for me to watch. Dale Earnhardt meant alot to me and I still get really choked up about his death. I often avoid watching certain thjings about him because it is just too painful to relive the memories of his death. That being said, I wanted to see this. I remember Richard Childress raving about the job they did with the film and how this doc is going to focus on the side of Earnhardt most never had the chance to see. After watching it, I did fill up with tears during during the part dealing with his death. It was really heartbreaking. They show an interview given the morning of the 500. They show him saying goodbye to his family and strapping into his car. And they steadily show parts of the race itself as it leads up to the final lap. And as for the crash- they finally show part of Earnhardt's in- car camera view of the fatal crash. I saw this footage once- the day of his death on ESPN. They never showed it again. But I always felt it was important to see, because everyone who saw that crash thought that it didn't look that bad- myself included. But when you see the in- car view at full speed with live audio...only then can you see the tremendous impact he hit the wall with. During the film they fade to white just at the point of impact, which I was disappointed with because you can't appreciate the severity of the crash without hearing and seeing the full impact (you never see Dale anyway, the view is straight out the front window, so there is nothing graphic to hide). The interviews with Darrell Waltrip were also hard to see, as he couldn't seem to talk about Dale without getting really emotional. I would have liked to see Kirk Shelmerdine- where was he? Unfortunately, I found myself saying that alot during this. There was no mention made about Neil Bonnett either, who was one the people closest to Earnhardt and who's death in 1994 really affected him in a profound way. This was never brought up. And also, what about Earnhardt SR and Jr. finishing first and second in the IROC race? Junior has said that was a huge moment for both of them. Throughout this, I felt alot was overlooked or rushed through, like there was this all important time constraint here.  One of the biggest ommissions was when they were talking about his Daytona 500 failures they never even mentioned one the weirdest and most disappointing ones of them all- when he struck a seagull during the race that damaged his front nose and took him out of contention for the win.
And the Daytona race where he got airborne and flipped over several times. When the medical crews reached him and told him he had to wait for a wrecker, he actually got his badly mangled car running and drove it back to the pits.  Then there was the feud between him and Geoff Bodine that carried on for a long time in the mid to late 80's. They did not mention any of that either. It was a big deal, though, and finally ended with the two of them having a meeting with Bill France Sr. himself.
 There was alot more to this story that was left out, which is disappointing to true fans like myself, because the casual fans who watch this film deserve to see a more complete picture of the man who was Dale Earnhardt. The positive things I have to say about the movie is that the there is alot of footage I have never seen before. I loved the inclusion of the footage where he is leaning out the window of his car driving with his knee under caution because Childress wouldn't let him pit to clean off a dirty windshield. That was priceless and I laughed out loud. Only Earnhardt would have done that and gotten away with it! Also, it's great hearing Childress talk intimately about his closest friend. He clearly still has difficulty coming to terms with Dale's death and reveals for the first time how close he came to quitting racing and why he carried on. The interviews with him and Waltrip were very emotional at times, and hard to watch at certain moments, but still good to see included.  So, all in all, a great attempt at capturing Dale, but falls short of what could have been. Still definitely worth buying. The collector's tin packaging is awesome! And the extra features are tremendous as well. There are six discs here in all and each one of them has great stuff in it. And for the affordable price (under $20) it's a no- brainer to buy this.",1203465600,14,4352,4.395781637717121
3044582,5,B000ZZUVRM,"If you don't have this DVD set....GET IT!  If Dale were here, he would be proud of this set.  This DVD set puts the ""#3"" DVD that ESPN did to shame!!",1202601600,,149,3.774193548387097

3044584,5,B000ZZUVRM,"First off I must say that Earnhardt was a true hero to me ever since I was about 10 years old (now 34) and hardly a day goes that a thought or remembrance of him doesn't enter into my mind. Needless to say, this self made, hardworking, hard charging man made quite an impression on my life. This is an excellent documentary on the man who started with so little and later became what some call ""a real life superhero"". It documents very well Dale's life on and off the track. Lot's of interviews with family, friends, competitors, and even of Dale himself. Also included are the full versions of the 1998 Daytona 500 and the 2000 Winston 500 which next to NC State's 1983 NCAA Basketball championship, may be the most astonishing finish I've ever seen. Dale came from 17th spot in 4 laps to grab his final WC win.

For character acting...in telling the story of a well-known sports figure based on facts pretty well known by anyone who's paid NASCAR any attention over the last 20 years, it was ok.

The film ""Dale"" is a documentary, albeit a well told story narrated by actor/racing enthusiast Paul Newman that's compellingly conveyed with archived television coverage of Earnhardt's races, and old photos which are key to telling his dad's story.  What hooked me, though, were the interviews with Earnhardt's friends, his peers within the racing world, and his family.  To me, these conversations tell ""The Intimidator's"" real story.

I learned that Earnhardt had once said that his greatest regret was his not taking up his dad's offer to buy Dale a brand new car if Dale'd just finish high school.  That was quite an offer from a man that supported his family by racing North Carolina's dirt tracks.  Dale quit school, any way, to focus on racing. Then his dad, Ralph, died suddenly at age 45.  He died before seeing the payoff for his son's inherited passion, and determination, to be first on race day: the driver of the #3 car's ascension to becoming a renowned NASCAR racing champion.

The film frame's Earnhardt's life and career with breaks to CBS Sports' coverage of the 1998 Daytona 500; a race day that, going into it, felt to driver and race team alike to feel a bit different...race day feelings symbolized by a penny glued to the dashboard of Earnhardt's #3 car...feelings about a race for which he'd already used 19 different ways to lose.",1204675200,,2393,4.874074074074074
3279078,4,B000ZZUVRM,"This was hard for me to watch. Dale Earnhardt meant alot to me and I still get really choked up about his death. I often avoid watching certain thjings about him because it is just too painful to relive the memories of his death. That being said, I wanted to see this. I remember Richard Childress raving about the job they did with the film and how this doc is going to focus on the side of Earnhardt most never had the chance to see. After watching it, I did fill up with tears during during the part dealing with his death. It was really heartbreaking. They show an interview given the morning of the 500. They show him saying goodbye to his family and strapping into his car. And they steadily show parts of the race itself as it leads up to the final lap. And as for the crash- they finally show part of Earnhardt's in- car camera view of the fatal crash. I saw this footage once- the day of his death on ESPN. They never showed it again. But I always felt it was important to see, because everyone who saw that crash thought that it didn't look that bad- myself included. But when you see the in- car view at full speed with live audio...only then can you see the tremendous impact he hit the wall with. During the film they fade to white just at the point of impact, which I was disappointed with because you can't appreciate the severity of the crash without hearing and seeing the full impact (you never see Dale anyway, the view is straight out the front window, so there is nothing graphic to hide). The interviews with Darrell Waltrip were also hard to see, as he couldn't seem to talk about Dale without getting really emotional. I would have liked to see Kirk Shelmerdine- where was he? Unfortunately, I found myself saying that alot during this. There was no mention made about Neil Bonnett either, who was one the people closest to Earnhardt and who's death in 1994 really affected him in a profound way. This was never brought up. And also, what about Earnhardt SR and Jr. finishing first and second in the IROC race? Junior has said that was a huge moment for both of them. Throughout this, I felt alot was overlooked or rushed through, like there was this all important time constraint here.  One of the biggest ommissions was when they were talking about his Daytona 500 failures they never even mentioned one the weirdest and most disappointing ones of them all- when he struck a seagull during the race that damaged his front nose and took him out of contention for the win.
And the Daytona race where he got airborne and flipped over several times. When the medical crews reached him and told him he had to wait for a wrecker, he actually got his badly mangled car running and drove it back to the pits.  Then there was the feud between him and Geoff Bodine that carried on for a long time in the mid to late 80's. They did not mention any of that either. It was a big deal, though, and finally ended with the two of them having a meeting with Bill France Sr. himself.
 There was alot more to this story that was left out, which is disappointing to true fans like myself, because the casual fans who watch this film deserve to see a more complete picture of the man who was Dale Earnhardt. The positive things I have to say about the movie is that the there is alot of footage I have never seen before. I loved the inclusion of the footage where he is leaning out the window of his car driving with his knee under caution because Childress wouldn't let him pit to clean off a dirty windshield. That was priceless and I laughed out loud. Only Earnhardt would have done that and gotten away with it! Also, it's great hearing Childress talk intimately about his closest friend. He clearly still has difficulty coming to terms with Dale's death and reveals for the first time how close he came to quitting racing and why he carried on. The interviews with him and Waltrip were very emotional at times, and hard to watch at certain moments, but still good to see included.  So, all in all, a great attempt at capturing Dale, but falls short of what could have been. Still definitely worth buying. The collector's tin packaging is awesome! And the extra features are tremendous as well. There are six discs here in all and each one of them has great stuff in it. And for the affordable price (under $20) it's a no- brainer to buy this.",1203465600,14,4352,4.395781637717121
3279079,5,B000ZZUVRM,"If you don't have this DVD set....GET IT!  If Dale were here, he would be proud of this set.  This DVD set puts the ""#3"" DVD that ESPN did to shame!!",1202601600,,149,3.774193548387097

3279081,5,B000ZZUVRM,"First off I must say that Earnhardt was a true hero to me ever since I was about 10 years old (now 34) and hardly a day goes that a thought or remembrance of him doesn't enter into my mind. Needless to say, this self made, hardworking, hard charging man made quite an impression on my life. This is an excellent documentary on the man who started with so little and later became what some call ""a real life superhero"". It documents very well Dale's life on and off the track. Lot's of interviews with family, friends, competitors, and even of Dale himself. Also included are the full versions of the 1998 Daytona 500 and the 2000 Winston 500 which next to NC State's 1983 NCAA Basketball championship, may be the most astonishing finish I've ever seen. Dale came from 17th spot in 4 laps to grab his final WC win. The movie, all the extra's and all the rare interviews make the price of this set an absolute steal to any NASCAR fan.",1196985600,48,932,4.362068965517241

So there you go. We all have frailties, but in some situations a person can become like iron in his behavior while those around him are more like lead.
