8448656,5,B004YOEGA8,"If you don't know Turpin this is as good as the better known guys. You get four movies on this adding up to 89 minutes. Typical value, typical  music,. But with one atypical movie worthy of mention. Why Ben Bolted. Ive heard of this title before but never seen it. What a hoot! It appears to be missing the initial original intro, or maybe I was asleep. It took a while to get what was going on and it lost me for a bitbut then I started to catch up and it was fun to anticipate. In fact it turned into one of the screwiest fruitiest silent comedies I have ever seen! Maybe not the ending I would have done but it was a hoot getting there all the same. Worth the price for this movie alone.",1386288000,,690,4.036496350364963

8448658,4,B004YOEGA8,"Another fine collection of silent comedies from this wonderful cross-eyed comedian. The quality is quite watchable, but shows it's age, still a must and quite recommended for any collector of silent comedy.",1357516800,,206,5.46875
8448659,3,B004YOEGA8,"This is a wonderful collection of Ben Turpin's work from the silent era. I've always loved his work and was very excited to find a compilation of his films available on DVD. My only complaint is that these are un-restored films. Much is lost from these films because of the vey poor quality of the prints from which they were made. I watched the films, in restored condition on Turner Classics and had hoped for something like that in terms of quality. That is not the case. Still, a joy to watch.",1351468800,4,497,4.413043478260869
8448660,5,B004YOEGA8,"Little did Ben know then...when photo was shot.. that many years after his time he'd become my ""Best Friend Ever!"" Obviously a man of Quality Breeding! not likely to appear anytime soon on any ""Reality"" TV show or be subject to any scandalous accusations of questionable behavior. He was quite simply a Man for the Ages! Oh! and this DVD is FUNNY!!!",1331078400,2,349,4.645161290322581
