8002000,4,B0000E6FOO,"This wasn't a bad film, made for TV quality but entertaining none the less.  Basically the Erickson's are a couple who have had enough of the unfair world and want their share.  The guy is an ex cop, his wife some sort of scientist, not that they use their experience and life skills to become super criminals or anything (that would have been a cool movie), the husband simply walks into banks with a fake beard, baseball cap and gun and demands money.  The wife waits as the getaway driver in a car parked somewhere the husband will arrive in another getaway car after out driving the police.  You'd think someone who used to be a cop would be aware of dye bombs and things like this but as I said they don't use the skills they should have with their crime, they're just simple bank robbers.  Of course the age old enough is never enough money to be happy means they've got to rob more and more banks. The husband is becoming a bit of a celebrity which is annoying the FBI cop who is supposed to bring him down.  There's a few side stories one involving the FBI guys dad who has some sort of Alzheimer's affecting him but remembers a hippy with a beard that he shot decades ago.  The wife bank robber also seems to have some sort of sickness that affects her sanity at times.  Neither of these sides stories are really fleshed out to any great extent and you do wonder what they really added to the movie.

At the end we get some text on screen summary which probably means this was all based on some sort of real life husband and wife bank robbers.  but you've got plenty of police car chases where cops don't seem to have been trained in pursuit driving and crash and other over the top nonsense which means if it was, it was pretty loosely based with a lot of artistic licence thrown in.

It was interesting seeing some 80's/90's stars you haven't seen on screen or in TV for a while.  Lori Loughlin whatever happened to her?",1445731200,,1931,4.3185595567867034

8002003,4,B0000E6FOO,"This is a true story from the FBI files about a Chicago husband and wife team robbing area banks...very entertaining...a lot of action...with the FBI chasing them down...and ends with them going out in a ""blaze of glory"". If you enjoy this DVD as I did, there is another such movie entitled, ""In the Line of Duty: The FBI Murders"" that you ought to look into.",1362614400,3,359,4.454545454545454
8002004,5,B0000E6FOO,"I saw this made for TV movie years ago. I loved the story line. A young couple turn to crime to make ends meet and they are soon in over their heads. They are intelligent and articulate but each have flaws that hold them together and define their choices. Bruce Campbell was great in this, his character is a departure for him and I think it really showcases his talent. It was nice seeing Lori Laughlin in a different type of role as well. The two of them had great chemistry together and were very believable as a couple. You find yourself pulling for them - even though they are the bad guys! It was also interesting from law enforcement's prospective. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys true crime films and documentaries. The story is compelling and the characters are very ""fleshed out"" you care about them - no matter what side of the fence you are on.",1360454400,2,868,4.43125
8002005,5,B0000E6FOO,"Ok, I bought this movie to add to my Bruce Campbell collection, but it turned out to be an interesting story in its own right.  Bruce plays a bank robber, that you really can care about.",1223596800,3,186,4.166666666666667
