8090366,1,B000BP5R2K,Disappointed it does not have more dancing!,1479859200,,43,5.285714285714286
8090367,1,B000BP5R2K,"The main disappointment is that the hustle demonstrated in this video is not the same hustle that I see people dancing.

Trautman uses the words and rhythm ""quick-quick-slow-slow"" to demonstrate hustle. This is exactly the same rhythm as swing starting on the rock-step.  He is right to point out that others use different word counts like ""and-one-two-three.""  However, he incorrectly claims that it makes no difference which way you do it or say it. The rhythm and the dance are  distinctly different the way he teaches it. He seems not to appreciate that. Where I come from (New York), people dance it ""and-one-two-three.""  In the hustle that I see people dancing, the back rock step is on the ""and"" (i.e., syncopated).  In Trautman's version, the back rock step is on the beat.  Huge difference!

Production quality is not terrible, but neither is it high quality.  There is some decent demonstration of a number of dance patterns.  However, not demonstrating one of the widely used hustle rhythms is a huge shortcoming. This video impresses me as a waste.",1337040000,,1060,4.937853107344632
8090368,5,B000BP5R2K,"If you want to learn the Hustle, this is the DVD for you.  Don't bother with anything else, this is all you need.  Shawn Trautman and his wife are big on telling you how to lead and follow, which is missing in some other DVDs I have.  Don't look any further than Shawn Trautman's dance instructional DVDs.  I have bought others but his are far better then any other dance DVDs I have.",1302998400,,384,4.219178082191781
8090369,1,B000BP5R2K,This video did not meet my expectations at all.  It looked like it was shot with a home video.  Sorry - had to return it.,1194134400,4,121,3.8
8090370,5,B000BP5R2K,"Honestly, when I first thought about Hustle, I thought it was an old out-dated dance that no one did anymore. Then I saw some dancers actually do the hustle and it looked like so much fun. I bought 3 or 4 DVDs on Hustle and Shawn's was one of them. It was the only DVD that put things into the beginners perspective and broke down each step for someone like me who doesn't understand some of the basic steps of dancing. I usually only had to review things once and he provided plenty of time for me to practice which I surely needed! I recommend this to any person looking to dance the hustle. You've found the right DVD!",1181865600,,621,4.226890756302521
8090371,5,B000BP5R2K,I always wanted to learn to do the hustle because it goes with so many styles of music.  This is a fantastic learning tool.  Shawn breaks the dance down in such a clear format that it is easy to pick up.  He also offers a lot of hints which are super helpful.  I've been dancing for a long time and was surprised to see a video that was just as educational as private instruction.  I can't wait to try the west coast swing!!,1173744000,8,424,4.0602409638554215
8090372,5,B000BP5R2K,"Hi, having some fun now. this dvd is great. It teaches you the steps

at a slow pace. You watch, look, and listen and you will be dancing in know time.

Then put it to your music and dance away.enjoy.",1164240000,5,200,3.975
8090373,5,B000BP5R2K,In the early 80's my wife and I did a lot of Disco dancing but somehow the dance craze died down and we forgot all the moves. Now with this DVD it brings us back to dancing Disco again which is great for when we go on cruises and even social dancing in our hometown. There seem to be a revival of the old Disco dance. The steps and moves in the DVD are all we need. They are easy to follow and to remember because of repetitive instructions. The review at the end sums it all up.,1161561600,10,479,3.8979591836734695
8090374,5,B000BP5R2K,It is evident in this video lesson that these instructors really want you to learn the Hustle!  The insight from their experience in teaching dance really shows when they can anticipate where a student might need help and then coach with precision through those steps.  They repeat the dance steps often while counting and then help to build the skills needed for the more complex combinations.  I really like the review of all of the steps at the end of the video and the bonus material that is included as a challenge.  The lesson is fun and you will be inspired to dance when you watch this video!,1145664000,24,600,4.527777777777778
