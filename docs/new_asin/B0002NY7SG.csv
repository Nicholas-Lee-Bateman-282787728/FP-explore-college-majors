8029746,2,B0002NY7SG,"Since being a big fun of Suzi once I saw this DVD bought it right away. Great disappointment. These are not old videos or concert but new live performance 2010 I believe, doesn't matter anyway.
Poor show, very average musiciants of the band , and Suzi is let say different...especially her voice..
Gave two stars just for the old days sake, the real would be only ONE....",1374364800,,371,4.552238805970149
8029747,5,B0002NY7SG,"If you are a fan of Suzi Quatro, then this dvd is a MUST-HAVE! Unfortunatly, it only goes for 40 minutes, and if you're a Suzi junkie like me then thats TOO short. But its better than nothing at all, and those fourty minuets are packed with Suzi FUN!!!",1327276800,,252,4.163265306122449
8029748,2,B0002NY7SG,"The DVD is terrible. Too bad because Suzi is the best. This just don't show it. All the horns is destroying it. Her voise is tired and the whole show is on auto pilot.
Get the Live in Japan DVD from 1975. Then you see what i'm talking about. Suzi should really lose the horns and all the brass. She's much better without it.
Too bad she never will make a good DVD that shows how good she really is.
This will disappoint you.
Sorry to say it, but this is terrible.",1297814400,2,463,4.043478260869565
8029749,5,B0002NY7SG,"When not able to see Suzi live, this DVD is the second best. In spite of living in Sweden (and warnings/advice from Amazon) was there no problem to watch the DVD on my regular DVD-player. I saw Suzi live on a cruise to land this fall, october 15. With this DVD, I can watch the show over and over again.",1258675200,,303,4.066666666666666
8029750,3,B0002NY7SG,"The DVD was a birthday present with the recipient really enjoying Suzie, she is a huge fan of hers. The DVD had all of the songs she enjoys and has already played it numerous times.

There is a lack of Suzie DVD's so it was good to be able to purchase this through Amazon.

I also find the entire ordering process easy and deliver to New Zealand was quick and efficient.",1225152000,,370,4.197183098591549
8029751,1,B0002NY7SG,This DVD is terrible she should of stuck to basics and not have back up singers and trumpets I actually turned if off half way through. I would rather see a DVD of all her video clips right from the start of her career.,1197072000,3,219,4.0
8029752,3,B0002NY7SG,"This DVD has two major drawbacks in quality department - poor sound and weird video editing. Individual instruments are lost in audio mix, Suzi's bass can be heard only during her solo, and all in all one can hardly hear treble or bass - only middle range frequencies.

The video editing is done MTV-style: quick takes, fast cuts preventing to see what's going on, no long shots, if there are some close-ups, they are really close - only the face is seen. I've got an impression that the camera man got some new modern equipment and he tried every trick in the book with it, while the editor decided that several different shots per second is quite normal for live rock performance. As a result after 5 minutes of this video motley my eyes got tired, and very soon I've got a real headache!

Artists like Suzi do not need all this modern video extravaganza - her music is a little bit old-fashioned (and we love her for this!), and her show should be shot accordingly. The show itself was quite good, and it can be seen in the second half of the program when the editor slows down a little bit and allows us to see the performance (at last!).

As for b/w archive footage and old video footage embedded by the editor into the show itself, frankly I would prefer to see it in bonus materials: complete versions of old videos and archive footage.

Five stars for the show and only one star for DVD quality ends in resultant three stars.",1113782400,22,1433,4.437262357414449
8029753,3,B0002NY7SG,"Les titres: The Wild One, Rock Hard, Can The Can, 48 Crash, Stumblin in, She's in love with you, Tear me appart, If you can give me love Glycerine queen Devil Gate drive (dans le desorde) Voila un appercu d'un concert actuel de Suzi Quatro. Le bon cot, c'est surtout le solo de basse de Suzi, ainsi que l'intro de Can the Can, ou Suzi assure elle-meme la percussion. Le moins bon, c'est les arrangements de cuivres, qui sonnent trs mal, et qui rapelle les concerts ""Grosse production"" de Johnny Hallyday avec cuivres et guitare electrique. C'est pas mal, mais les fans de Suzi Quatro peuvent ne pas apprecier. D'autant plus que la voix de Suzi est trs abime, et les ocasions de le constater ne manque pas. Le punch lui, est toujours l. La realistation du concert est un peu enervante, avec ce mauvais film en noir et blanc du dbut qui revient dans le concert, en faisant un effet ""stroboscope"" ou film film sur tlphone portable. Sinon l'image, comme le son sont OK pendant le concert. Dans certains titres, on revoit Suzi dans des apparitions TV d'epoques, qui sont assez bien venu dans ce concert. Le bonus, lui est un indit de l'album ""Then and now"", qui n'est que la musique du Suzi Quatro avec en image, la vue a travers un camion! Un peu inutile, a mon gout, une apparition de Suzi dans ce bonus aurait t le minimum, meme en photo! Ceci dit, 45 minutes de concert plus un bonus inutile, on pouvait en attendre un peu mieux. Heuresement que c'est Suzi Quatro, parce que sinon...

If you want contact me, no problem. I'm a fan of Suzi Quatro",1101945600,5,1544,4.455830388692579
