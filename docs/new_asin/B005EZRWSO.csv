8469350,3,B005EZRWSO,"Seriously, I bought this movie for two reasons, it is a sorta sequel/remake of Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama and it stars a friend of mine.
If you like the original/first movie and don't mind the lower budget then you will probably enjoy this movie.  There are plenty of humorous moments, less than stellar acting, and some gore.  One of my favorites parts of the movie is the intestine dragging scene with Taffy.",1418256000,,427,4.756756756756757
