7583713,5,B019WJ6X4Q,"A lot of reviews disliked the look of this movie and the dark content, but my sons really enjoyed it. My oldest wanted it because it is narrated by EvantubeHD. I warned him it was about death but he wanted it anyway. The odd imagery & stylized characters didn't bother him and he really liked the story. My youngest (age 3) doesn't really understand the complex death analogies but was interested in the movie anyway. It is a different type of movie but maybe that's what makes it interesting.",1472428800,2,493,4.550561797752809
7583714,5,B019WJ6X4Q,"My kids liked this so much. And I liked it, too. The animation is great, full of thoughtful details, and the music is lovely. You know the feeling when you've lost someone and you would do anything just to spend one more day with them? Well in this film you get to see that wish fulfilled. More people should see this!",1471737600,3,318,4.229508196721311

7583718,1,B019WJ6X4Q,"If I could give this zero stars,  I would.  I grabbed this at redbox for my 3 year old thinking it was an innocent animated film.  It was creepy and scary,  about death and the afterlife.  We turned it off after 30 minutes as my child was getting so sad that the bunny was separated from his parents and then he drowns and ends up in a creepy afterlife with absent eyed, sad dead bunnies.",1460073600,4,388,4.12

It's got a lot of heart.",1487030400,2,352,3.5844155844155843

8746053,5,B019WJ6X4Q,My grandson loves this movie.  He wants to watch it and enjoys all the characters and the music.  It is kind of sad because it is about grief for a loved one but unfortunately grief is a part of life we all have to go through.  The movie answers questions about how to deal with grief and accept the death of a loved one.  The characters during Jonah's journey of grief keep the story entertaining and fun to watch and the music is beautiful.,1479427200,2,442,4.226190476190476
