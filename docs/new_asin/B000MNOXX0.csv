2737684,5,B000MNOXX0,"I had never heard of this movie when I decided to rent it for a night.  I was pleasantly surprised, this movie both scared me and kept me on the edge of my seat.  While it is a very indie flick, it was very engrossing and hit close to home.  I loved it, and would reccommend it to law and order svu lovers and anyone into thrillers.",1177372800,,332,3.925373134328358
2737685,4,B000MNOXX0,"This was a very disturbing, yet, very engrossing movie.  Real life crime stories intrique me and this was no exception.  I thought the two main leads, Collins and Prepon were exceptionally good and it's a role certainly against type for Prepon.  Perhaps there is too much sympathy for Karla in the movie, however, if some of the deleted scenes had been included, it may not have been the case in the finished product.  This movie could have been explotive if the sex and rape scenes were more brutal, but, I commend all involved for leaving more to the immaginiation than the eyes.  It's a movie you really want to follow almost word for word, frame by frame, as to not miss something that might give you a reason to understand the callousness and the brutality of the two principals in the case.  I highly recommend this movie, but, it is disturbing, especially knowing it is based on a true story.  Well done, well crafted, and well worth seeing.",1175904000,33,948,4.607142857142857

2737690,3,B000MNOXX0,Apparently I can't do half stars.  It was ok.  I liked the girl who played Karla as an actress.  She does well at whatever she does. It was definitely some insight on the amount of power others can have over us if we let them.,1484352000,,226,3.977777777777778

2737846,1,B000MNOXX0,"First off, this movie portrays Karla as a victim, an abused wife just trying desperately to keep her husband happy.  That's pretty inconsistent with the facts, and the tapes that were found showing her to be a willing and active participant to the kidnapping, sexual abuse, and torture.  She was a sociopath that worked the system for lenience, and that's pretty much universally agreed upon.

Storywise, there's no chemistry between Paul and Karla, and instead of the happy, beautiful couple that the real life Ken and Barbie Killers put up, we get a mopey wife, and an irrationally abusive husband.  There's no introspection here, no psychology, no attention to motivation.

The result is a poorly developed serial rapist and killer paired with an unquestioning victim, and the audience is left wondering why.  In one scene, a victim asks Karla why she stays, and she says, ""You don't understand."". Well, nobody understands, and the movie misses an opportunity to explain why.",1473897600,9,978,5.08125

It was very hard to see these two beloved actors in this film. Maybe that was their point but it was hard to watch in either case. I""m not sure what was served by this somewhat graphic story. There are movies like American Crime that was beyond graphic with exceptional acting that I felt I had to make myself watch & cry through the whole thing to bear witness for the victim, not let her be forgotten or the tremendous atrocities that even children were capable of. I'll remember & cry for her everytime I do. This film was a story that didn't address who the victims were. They didn't care and I understand that is who they were.  But I would have liked to have had more insight about the victims so that I was allowed to care about the victims more than their demise or who did it. The victims deserved better and I don't lump Karla into that category.  She could have helped, or stopped it at any time, if her version is to be believed.

Being this is the wife's side, it is easy to see she is not really the poor abused wife. I think she went into this relationship, knowing what she was doing.

I read the book about the murders so I know the REAL story...  This movie should have a disclaimer to it saying this is from Karlas perseption and what the police believed BEFORE they were given the video tapes....  Yeah he beat her and badly, but battered womans syndrome?  I don't think so, and I don't pretend to know exactly what to call her....  I do know she is a sociopath plain and simple.....  The tapes show she particapated willinglyj...  More than willingly, she enjoyed herself...  So much so that the police were horrified that she had already sighned a plea deal.  The movie shows her looking like she had to put up with these things and do what he said....  IT WASNT LIKE THAT!  Everyone knows that, so why did they make the movie come out looking as such....  Its not factual at all....  Its what SHE wants you to believe it was before the tapes were shown....  To me its an injustice to the victims to let her get off and potraying her in this manner.  I would like to know what the film maker was thinking, and why did he do it.....  This movie was made as if HER lawyer made it for the jury to prove her innocense and how she was victimized....  It could have been true...  I just want to know why?  Before she even meant him she told people that she fantacies about taking a red pen and a knife and playing dot to dot one someones body and then poring vinager into the wounds..... They didn't tell you that in the movie....  No I don't need them to sensationalize the movie.  They don't have to the truth is alot more then that.....  This woman is a cold blooded killer plain and simple....  In the movie she walks around on egg shells worried and disqusted by him.....  IT WASNT LIKE THAT!  This is one of the biggest travesties of justice that has ever been....  After they were given the video tapes from her lawyer they referred to the plea deal as ""the deal with the devil""....

It allows people who are not familiarized with this case to believe Karla was somehow a victim when she in fact is just as cold hearted as Paul. St. Catharines is where I grew up. I went to poor Kristen Frenchs funeral. I know her family. This happened in MY neighborhood - I was neighbors with these two sick perverts! It scared me and all other young girls knowing some sicko was out, I helped look for Leslie and Kristen. This was a group effort to help find these girls. It hurts to this day to know what happened to them. The indignities on every level are chilling. Karla should never have been released let alone live a normal life now. The only level of comfort is that Tammy, Leslie and Kristen are laying in peace. I've visited their graves many times since and recall all too well what it felt like to know that a sicko was loose in our St Catharines where all seemed innocent until Paul & Karla ripped that away.
I'm giving this film a one star because it's not accurate nor should any glorifying be given these two sickos. The pain these girls felt should not be ""enjoyed"" in viewing.

2737972,4,B000MNOXX0,"I believe that the first time that I learned about Paul Bernardo was while watching the show ""Wicked Attraction.""  The story almost didn't seem real, it was so outlandish, and so twisted.  After watching that episode and watching some YouTube videos, I actually was quite convinced of the following:  Mr. Bernardo is worse than Ted Bundy.  Why?  Well, it seems to me that Mr. Bundy didn't ""toy"" with his victims too much; he was ""nice"" enough to kill them quickly -- at least most of the time -- while Mr. Bernardo treated his victims like mice, and he wasn't really much of a playful cat while doing it.

But after doing a little research -- currently, I am reading the book ""Invisible Darkness"" by Stephen Williams (I am only about 1/4 through, but it seems to be a terrific read so far; Mr. Williams is a very good writer, no doubt about that) -- it appears that a lot of people think that Karla Homolka is worse than Mr. Bernardo!  Perhaps it's because most serial killers are men; perhaps it's because Ms. Homolka should have helped protect the females that Mr. Bernardo tormented; perhaps it was for other reasons that people have this belief.  I'm not completely sure.

But here is the rub.  When you get into these types of arguments, you're really devolving into a moral equivalence fallacy.  Does it really matter who's worse, really?  And is it even possible to know?  Couldn't it be the case that they're all morally depraved, and therefore it just doesn't really matter?

But I have seen a few reviews around on ""Karla,"" and a lot of people don't like this film because, in their opinion, it puts Ms. Homolka into too good of a light.  A lot of them wanted this film to slam her instead of trying to explain why she did what she did.  But that is not the purpose of film, really.  Film is to entertain, even while it is hard to say that this film is completely entertaining due to the subject matter.  And even though Misha Collins is pretty good as Mr. Bernardo, I believe Ms. Prepon is the true star here, and really is allowed to show her acting chops with this performance.

Don't allow yourself to get sucked down the moral equivalency drain, if you decide to watch the film.  Instead, watch it for Ms. Prepon's performance.  While it may be arguable how bad Ms. Homolka really was or still even is (while she supposedly is living in paradise now somewhere in the Caribbean), I think it is not very arguable that Ms. Prepon gives a very powerful performance in this role.",1360281600,,2489,4.523489932885906

2737985,5,B000MNOXX0,"Misha Collins who portrays Paul Bernardino in this film stated that he could not sleep while filming this movie.  His portrayal of the cold hearted killer was chilling and top notch acting.  He was Paul.  This is one of those rare instances that when you think of the real killer that this movie is based on, you can only picture Misha Collins in your mind.  That is how good he is in this film.

Laura Prepon is a revelation also.  It is truly brilliant acting when you can say so much and not speak at all.  She has the ability to speak with her eyes, and that is truly a talent.  I know nothing of the real Karla, but Laura makes her seem both sympathetic  and pathetic.  We see her only as a woman in love and willing to do anything to keep the man she loves.  She is most probably sick, yes, an accomplice to murder, yes.  But your heart hurts for her because of Prepon`s performance.  At least mine did.

There is no gore in this film but it didn't need any.  The psychological horror was enough.  Conscience and morality.  Where would we be without them?  More than likely we would be living the lives of Karla and Paul.  The film's message is clear: be careful what you do for love.  Because in the end, love may have nothing to do with  it.  I highly recommend this film for the heart felt performances.  I applaud the film makers for making this film despite many protests against it.  And I can only hope that Karla finds the peace that she stole from all those families of the victims.  One wonders that if the actor portraying Paul could not sleep at night, what does the real Karla see when she closes her eyes?  And is she perhaps still being continually punished in her own mental prison despite being free?  One can only wonder.",1308960000,3,1745,4.321981424148607
2737986,5,B000MNOXX0,"I first became fascinated by the Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka case when I had to study it in my high school class on Canadian Law in 2005. The Ken and Barbie killers. It was the only part of the whole course that wasn't completely boring. It was also the same year Karla was freed from prison. I watched the French CBC interview she gave the night she was freed (what a stupid move for such a hated woman I would've thought dead by now). I also read almost all the books and watched several documentaries about the case too. I was much more interested in Karla than in Paul. Simply because sadistic serial rapists/killers like Paul, as sad as it is to say, are a dime a dozen. But Karla was unique. She was a young pretty little enigma from our own Canada, who also happened to be a sadistic serial rapist/killer. Some psychiatrists that have evaluated her say she's pure evil, others say she's an innocent victim, and some came out saying she's a complete mystery. I personally think she is a person who happened to have been born without a conscience, like some people are born without limbs or vision or hearing. I think had she never met Paul, she wouldn't have done anything like this in her entire life. But she did. And she has no remorse for what she did, at all. Neither does her family. In Stephen Williams' first book about the case, Invisible Darkness, it's documented that, although her family appear to be nice normal people, they didn't really seem to care about what she had done. They defended her, stuck by her, and her mother, Dorothy, was heard to have said ""Well the girls are already dead, so might as well party"" at Karla's going away party before she went to prison. My theory is that the whole Homolka family is psychotic.

First time I watched the movie, I didn't like it. I was disappointed that the facts had been twisted the way they were. But the second time I watched it, I understood the whole point of having it be her side of the story. Because there are certain parts we don't know for sure exactly how they happened (the deaths of Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French not being videotaped), there are now three sides to this story: Karla's, Paul's, and the truth. Being told from her lying mouth was the only way they were able to make this movie. That, and also because Karla's compliant victim defense adds another layer of complexity to the story which might make it more interesting for some. She's still crazy, but it's a different kind of crazy you see. Since then, this has become one of my favorite movies. It really is well made and well acted. If it had been received better and not totally slandered by Canada (as a Canadian myself, I say you can't have a problem with this being based on a true story without having a problem with Bonnie and Clyde or Schindler's List), I think there could've been a possibility for Laura Prepon to have maybe even gotten an Oscar Nomination for this role. She probably thought it was going to be her big breakout role in Hollywood. And it could have been, especially after Charlize Theron received critical acclaim and an Academy Award for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster. But now she'll be remembered as Donna Pinciotti from That '70s Show, which is what I'm sure she was trying to avoid by taking on such a challenging and dark role. But she played the murderous bitch perfectly, especially during the evaluation scenes between her and her psychiatrist, Dr. Arnold, who served as a proper mediator for her unreliable narration. In a way, she was playing two different characters. Both the Karla who's been reported as having an ""indifferent, haughty and irritable"" personality, and the compliant victim Karla from her version of the story. The real Karla was obviously not that good an actress.

I've watched this movie with friends who knew nothing at all about the real case and they all liked it even though they thought it was sick and disturbing. But as sick and disturbing as this movie is, it's actually toned down through the movie's editing, as compared to what happened in real life. Almost every time I will watch the scenes of the psychotic rapes, torture, and murders of Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French (renamed in the film out of respect), I will cry. Although, one particular part always makes me laugh for some reason; when Karla mentions Demerol to Dr. Arnold, he asks her if she wants some. She then looks him dead in the eyes with a hateful expression on her face and just calmly says, ""No"". I don't know why, but that part always cracks me up! This movie has some flaws, as most movies do. For example, there are some minor omissions and a couple of names have been changed due to legal reasons. It's not perfect or a masterpiece by any means. And it doesn't have a moral at the end of the story, other than love makes you crazy. But it is a very good movie that seemed to get a lot of negativity that wasn't necessarily deserved. It is much better than it gets credit for.",1308355200,4,5004,4.53429203539823

2737993,3,B000MNOXX0,"This movie is very good if you want to scratch the surface of what Paul and Karla were involved in. It doesn't come close to revealing the herendous acts they committed, and I am aware that is very difficult without it bordering on child pornography or a snuff film. However, there are certain facts in the movie that are left out, which I think could be included in a tasteful way. Also, this movie does not examine Karla's role deep enough. There are things that anyone who follows the case knows as fact that Karla did rather than Paul that aren't included in the movie, and why I am not sure. There are also aspects of her personality which seem to just be left out of the film. Misha Collins did a great job of playing Paul Bernardo, right down to his voice. Whereas Laura Prepon did a good job, it was difficult for me to tell if she was really playing Karla or just playing herself and how she would react under the circumstances. I enjoy this movie enough to own it, but I would recommend that if this is all you have seen about Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, you read the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invisible-Darkness-The-Strange-Case-Of-Paul-Bernardo-and-Karla-Homolka/dp/055356854X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invisible Darkness: The Strange Case Of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka</a>&nbsp;by Stephen Williams for more information. There are plenty of other books out there to read as well, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadly-Innocence/dp/0446601543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadly Innocence</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Marriage-The-Unspeakable-Crimes-of-Paul-Bernardo-and-Karla-Homolka/dp/0345465806/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Marriage: The Unspeakable Crimes of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka</a>but I would recommend Williams' book because he very indepthly examines particularily Karla's role in everything that went on, and makes no excuses for her. There is a lot examined about Karla in that book. There is something different about Karla than Paul. Unfortunately, there are a lot of Paul Bernardos, but fortuately, or at least we would hope, there are not a lot of Karla Homolkas. If you have only seen this movie as a reference for Karla and Paul, I would definitely recommend doing some reading on them if you are interested in finding out more about the truth. Because this was just more a re-enactment of their crimes brought to the spotlight, and it barely scratches the surface. It is definitely not the best movie as far as quality, but it makes for an interesting watch, and an interesting look into the lives of two very depraved individuals.",1236384000,5,2757,5.826732673267327

KARLA LOVED PAUL SO MUCH THAT SHE KILLED HER OWN BABY SISTER AND THREE OTHER WOMEN. SHE LOVED HIM SO MUCH SHE WOULD ALLOW HIM TO TORTURE, TORMENT AND RAPE AND BEAT HER AND THE VICTIMS. SHE LIVED IN HELL AND YET ALLOWED IT.

THIS MOVIE IS VERY DEEP, DARK AND REALLY DISGUSTING. IT IS A TRUE LIFE FILM THAT HAUNTS YOU AS YOU WATCH KNOWING THIS STUFF HAPPENED. THIS IS A MOVIE THAT SHOULD BE WATCHED FOR THE FACT THAT THIS STUFF REALLY HAPPENS AND NEEDS TO BE STUDIED AND LOOKED UPON AND NOT HIDDEN SO THAT JUST MAYBE WE CAN STOP AND HELP THE NEXT VICTIMS.

THIS IS A VERY WELL ACTED MOVIE. THE DIRECTION IS GOOD. THE IMAGES OF MURDER AND TORMENT FILMED, EVEN THOU ALOT IS OFF SCREEN SO THAT YOU MUST USE YOUR MIND WHICH IS EVEN MORE HAUNTING IN MY THOUGHTS ARE SO WELL DONE THAT IT LEAVES IMAGES CLOUDING YOUR THOUGHTS.

THIS IS NOT A FUN MOVIE. IT'S NOT A SUSPENSE, ACTION, DRAMA. IT'S A MOVIE THAT IS ABOUT REAL MONSTERS. THIS FILM STICKS TO THE POINT TO WHAT IS KNOWN WITH IN THE COURT FILES. THESE MONSTERS FILMED THERE CRIMES, THE MURDER, RAPE AND SO ON, THE MOVIES WHERE DESTROYED RIGHT ALONG WITH THE HOUSE IN TRYING TO HUSH HUSH WHAT HAPPEND IN THIS LITTLE CANADIAN AREA. IT AMAZES ME HOW TOWNS WANT TO COVER UP THE BOOGEYMAN AND ACT LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED AND TO FORGET ABOUT THE VICTIMS OF THESE HORRIBLE CRIMES. EVERYBODY SAYS WELL THE HOUSE WAS TORN DOWN AND THE TAPES WHERE DESTROYED TO PROTECT THOSE INVOLVED, HOG WASH, IT WAS DESTRYOED TO FORGET ABOUT THIS CASE IN HOPES THAT BAD IMAGES OF THE TOWN AND AREA WOULD NOT BE TAINTED.

KARLA WAS A LYING, PSYCHOPATH RIGHT ALONG WITH HER HUSBAND PAUL. SHE HAS JUST AS MUCH TO DO WITH IT AS HE DID. SHE PLAYED THE SYSTEM AND WORKED THE EMOTIONS OF THOSE INVOLVED WITH HER CASE. AND NOW AS I WRITE THIS, THAT MONSTER, THAT BOOGEYMAN WALKS AMONG US. THIS WOMAN WHO HELPED KILL HER BABY SISTER AND THREE OTHER WOMEN, WHO WHERE TORTURED, RAPED, AND KEPT ALIVE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME TO BE TORMENTED BEYOND WORDS IS OUT LIVING HER LIFE.

THIS MOVIE WILL HAUNT AND TOUCH A NERVE THAT MAKES YOU WONDER AND THINK OF HOW PEOPLE CAN LIVE THIS WAY WITHOUT REMORSE. KARLA SHOWED NO REMORSE FOR HER ACTIONS, SHE COULD CARE LESS ABOUT ANYTHING SHE DID.

THIS MOVIE STARS AS KARLA LAURA PREPON, HER ROLE IS AMAZING. ONLY SEEING HER IN THE TV SHOW THAT 70'S SHOW AND NOW IN THIS ROLE OF A DISTURBED PERSON IS AMAZING. SHE CAPTURES THE EMOTIONAL HORROR OF KARLA IN REAL LIFE. MISHA COLLINS PLAYS PAUL WHO IS A TRUE EVIL PRESENCE IN ALL HIS ACTIONS. PAUL WAS A MAN THAT ENJOYED OTHERS TORMENT. HIS SEXUAL PLEASURE WAS PAIN AND TORMENT OF OTHERS. ONE SHOT IN THIS FILM IS DONE SO WELL THAT IT MAKES YOUR MOUTH DROP OPEN, PAUL COMES HOME AND LIKE IT'S NORMAL HE SAYS WITHOUT EMOTION, I RAPE A GIRL, I STOLE THESE CLOTHES FROM HER.

THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE, MUST WATCH. IT IS A REALITY BASED HORROR THAT WILL REMAIN IN YOUR MIND LONG AFTER THE MOVIE IS OVER.

MOST PEOPLE READING THIS REVIEW WILL BE LIKE I NEVER HEARD OF PAUL AND KARLA IT'S BECAUSE PLACES WANT TO HIDE THE TRUTH AND COVERUP THE HORROR THAT HAPPEND, THIS MOVIE WAS EVEN BOYCOTTED IN HOPES IT WOULD NOT BE PLAYED. SHAME ON ALL THAT WISH TO HIDE THE TRUTH OF THESE MONSTERS.

2738000,3,B000MNOXX0,"This movie is probably a fairly accurate portrayal of the actual rape-murders that Karla Homolka famously helped her boyfriend commit. Karla became complicit in procuring young girls for her boyfriend to kidnap and attack during his long reign of terror in the Scarborough/St. Catherines areas of Ontario, Canada. She was ultimately convicted of having participated in only one of the murders.

Karla denied any direct knowledge of the murder as it was in progress. So this movie obviously had to make a decision about how to present her. The producers/director probably struck close to the truth when they chose to in fact show Karla as being knowledgeable about and actively abetting the crimes.

However, there is a sort of inherent contradiction in that interpretation. The psychologists who evaluated Karla (one of whom is intelligently portrayed here by actor Patrick Bauchau) pronounced her a sociopath - an amoral person lacking any capacity for empathy. In this movie version of her though, we see a woman in thrall to her boyfriend. Karla is shown being motivated by a desperate need to accommodate his sick needs in order to hold onto him.

So we don't know - was Karla suffering from an inability to love, or was she suffering from a tendency to love too compulsively? Was she suffering from a form of Stockholm Syndrome? As her boyfriend brutalizes Karla in turn, did this abuse form an adhesive seam between the two, bonding Karla all the more tightly to her captor?

""Karla"" will leave you arguing these possibilities. Laura Prepon does a good job walking the line between the extremes. While, as Karla, she convincingly maintains she did it for love, her face remains blue ice impassive throughout her own and the other women's torment.

After watching this movie, you might be inclined to pursue the theme of a person's willingness to ""go along"" with madness a little further. If so, you can check out ""Bug"" starring Ashley Judd. ""Bug"" provides a fictional, but all-too-emotionally-real picture of a woman being drawn into the far side that is her boyfriend's world.",1193616000,2,2083,4.991354466858789
2738001,2,B000MNOXX0,"I wanted to watch this movie after watching an A&E documentary on Ken and Barbie killers. It turned out to be an odd combination of a documentary and a thriller, narrated from Karla's perspective and many times showing her as non cooperative, victimised woman but ending on an unsympathetic note to her. (The jury concluded she was 'artificial, manupulative and with a strong moral vaccum bordering on psychosis' but there is no depiction of these traits anywhere in the movie's portrayal of her, just a scared, victimised woman). For a low budget movie though the pace is entertaining and victims treated with respect, their names are changed and no nudity is shown.

2738003,4,B000MNOXX0,"I remember when the killings happened only 3 hrs away from my hometown. All of my father's family is from St Catherines and many of my family knew of or had met the victims. My grandmother actually went to church were one of the girls was abducted from. This case really hit home. I read one of the books that told the story of Karla and Paul and when I found out there was going to be a movie I was very interested in seeing it. I felt like by reading the book and watching the movie that I was keeping the victims memories alive not glorifying these sick people for the crimes they committed. This movie was only viewed in very few movie theatres in Canada, none in which were close to my home so I was unable to see the movie while in theatres. When the movie then became available on DVD again there was nowhere near to rent or buy it. I purchased this movie without ever seeing it but with a case that I had followed for such a long time I had the need to see it. This movie kept close to the facts that were released to the public through the media and the books available. The movie was very powerful, very graphic and very hard to believe to be true. It's so hard to believe that someone could do such horrible things to such innocent victims. I highly recommend this film but only to viewers that realize what this film in tales. The actors/actresses in this film did a wonderful job and I can only imagine how hard it was for them to be in these roles. To the families of the victims their memory is still alive.

2738005,3,B000MNOXX0,"""Karla"" is a small, fairly low-budget film that rather quietly recounts the story of Karla Homolka, wife of serial rapist and murderer Paul Bernardo. Being somewhat familiar with their story, I anticipated it would translate well to film. For the most part, the film succeeds in providing a realistic portrayal of a battered wife, whose husband managed to maintain a semblance of normalcy and elude capture for a few years. The tone of the film is fairly understated, which seems to contrast somewhat with the story. These were some horrific, disturbing events that might be shocking, though they were also true. Director Joel Bender deserves credit for not making them overly dramatic by adding stylized violence or ominous music, as so often happens in films that deal with this type of material. The actors also deserve credit for not overacting and hamming up their performances, which often occurs in horror and suspense films. Perhaps out of respect for the families of the victims, this film is not exploitive or sensationalized. If one watches this film expecting a prurient, American-style horror film, replete with blood, gore and gratuitous nudity, one will find the experience disappointing. I was, nonetheless, a little disappointed with the film, though not for the above reasons. It is pretty clear that Karla Homolka was abused by Paul Bernardo and that he perpetrated some atrocious, unconscionable acts. I cannot comprehend why abused women stay with their men, though I know it does happen. Karla Homolka was (and perhaps still is) a deceitful, manipulative individual, who knew her husband was raping and murdering young women; yet, she did nothing about it until her own life came into jeopardy. Even though she decided to stay, that doesn't provide rationale for condoning his raping and murdering these women. The end of the film contains an epilogue, which refutes much of what was portrayed in the film. It states in part that she has expressed no sympathy for the murdered girls, yet she is portrayed in the film as being at least moderately sympathetic toward them. She also did not appear to be too emotionally hurt by her abuse, as though the filmmakers could not decide what to make of her and consequently decided to write the character without much of a personality. It seems her character is based solely on a credulous, verbatim reading of interviews with her so that she comes across as stoic, detached and passive. Perhaps in reality she is emotionless and inured to her environment, though here she is presented so innocuously that it makes me wonder how ""Evil has a beautiful face"" was chosen as the tagline. Her character provides the impetus for the story since it is told from her perspective, which makes her lack of definition rather unfortunate for this film. Character issues aside, the film has too many slow-motion scenes, which gives it a little made-for-TV feel. Although no subtitles are included, the DVD does have several deleted scenes that are presented by the director. After hearing his extremely dry, insipid introductions, I understood how Karla's character came to be so underdeveloped. Contrast this film with ""Monster"" for a good example of how a person's motivations and experiences can be parlayed into an interesting, yet insidious character. For a different perspective of these characters, read the books ""Invisible Darkness"" or ""Deadly Innocence.""",1177545600,36,3414,5.10912343470483
8170383,2,B000MNOXX0,"The movie has an agenda to support the ""Karla was a victim too"" fallacy.  The real video evidence and her own words do not support this.

One only needs to watch the Fifth Estate episode with audio and video of Karla's police interviews.
1.  She says that she was never abused and he treated her great until months after the wedding.  So they killed twice before he started beating her.  She wasn't forced. He didn't beat her to get her to fool around with her passed out sister.  Remember, actual video exists of most of this.
2.  She is shown in a video going back to the home where they murdered the victims, and she's more concerned with where her perfume and furniture went than how she raped and killed children there.
3.  There's a very damning letter she sent to her lawyer admitting she was ""more involved than she remembered""
4. Look up the transcript for the video known as the ""fireside chat"" where she is having sex with Paul and pretending she's her dead sister, promising him them will go find more slaves for him, and how they should have kids so he can rape them too.
5.  It was Karla's idea to kill Kristin.  Karla insisted they ""get rid of her because she didn't want to go to work knowing she could escape"".  Her own words from police interview footage.
6.  Paul raped many times before Karla came along.  He never killed any of them.  Karla comes along...her jealousy of the ""slaves"" leads to murder.  I'm not trying to say Paul wasn't a monster, they both were.  I'm just saying she wasn't some helpless victim forced to do this stuff.
7.  She kidnapped one of the girls all on her own and drugged her just like she did her sister.  This one didn't die, but there's video of them both raping her while she's passed out.  It was a friend of Karla so sister...friend...doesn't matter, she will do it to anyone.  She's a textbook sociopath and once you hear her interviews you'll realize there's zero remorse or conscience in that woman.
8.  She was not some insecure weak little thing.  Her friends describe her as strong, intelligent, and a leader.
9.  Once the videos were seen, she was caught lying several times when she gave her testimony against Paul.  Her ""woe is me"" story doesn't line up with the truth.

The crown bought into her lies about being a victim before the video tapes came to light.  Her lawyer hid the tapes to get her a deal.  After the tapes were shown to the prosecution and crown, they refused to change their position or the deal with her.  They wanted to save face.  They didn't want to look bad, so they stuck a child murdering rapist back on the streets after a 12 year vacation where she had it quite easy..  They had spent some 11 million dollars on the case so they didn't care that she was lying at that point.  
One of the psychologists who supported the analysis that she was forced to do this was interviewed on the Fifth Estate.  Once he saw her letters, he looked like he had seen a ghost.  She fooled them all, but with the real evidence in front of them, nobody believes in the battered wife defense.

Other than a very irritating positive spin for Karla, the movie wasn't horrible.  But knowing the trust makes it hard to see such a production spitting on the graves of the TRUE VICTIMS.

The only real victims in this story are dead.",1519084800,,3296,4.424292845257903
