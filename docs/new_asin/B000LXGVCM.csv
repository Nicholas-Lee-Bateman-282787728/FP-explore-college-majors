Thankfully, the plot consists of comedic con-men, gangsters, Bond style spy islands, go-go dancing, and musical numbers for pretty much everyone. It's old school Indian film making. Every genre gets a little screen time here and thankfully the actors and director are up to the task. It's an endurance test but it's a fun one to make it through. I also noticed this movie is oddly ambitious with it's camera work. A chase scene in a carnival involves a rather complicated tracking shot that seems oddly out of place in a probably made quickly by the seat of the pants popular film like this. It's appreciated.

Worth catching for 10 dollars easily.",1459900800,,724,4.612403100775194
8164818,1,B000LXGVCM,"Though the film, in typical Bollywood style, is a rip-off of some James Bond movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it when it came out over 30 years ago, and even watched it multiple times on VHS. Of course, the main attraction for me was Amitabh Bachchan.

However, EROS entertainment has totally chopped up this movie in the DVD, that you would be better off not getting it. They've deleted and cut out 12 scenes from the movie, not to mention the first refrain from the ""Janu Meri Jaan"" song.

Though they added a deleted scene from the video and one song, it doesn't make up for how they horribly cut out so many funny moments from the film. Even toward the end, during the action, while our heroes and heroines are trying to escape, EROS even cut out scenes of THAT.

It's so disappointing because all of the other movies that EROS puts out, have the complete movie. I just don't know why Shaan got the equivalent of a movie appearing on network television, with scenes cut out to make room for commercials.

That said, I really love this movie, but customers are better off buying this on VHS or if they can find another distributer that sells it. Avoid the EROS version like the PLAGUE.",1328054400,9,1183,4.488372093023256
