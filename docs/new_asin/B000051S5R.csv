7929394,2,B000051S5R,"Four under-funded poorly produced vignettes. Film school C+ at best.

Boring stories about under-developed characters leaves one with a vague ennui.

Not even a glimpse of Corinne Bohrer's breasts can instill interest.

Your money is best spent elsewhere.",1389312000,,255,5.657894736842105
