4049397,4,B0031P6X84,"The latest crime thriller from legendary Hong Kong auteur Johnnie To contains all of the existential angst, style, and moodiness of his past work. Notable for being To's first primarily English-language film, Vengeance was jointly produced by To's own Milkyway productions and a French studio. This French influence extends to the cast as singer and actor Johnny Hallyday occupies the lead role as a visitor to Macau looking to avenge the shooting of his daughter, and the deaths of his son-in-law and grandchildren. He hooks up with three hitmen (reliable To regulars Anthony Wong, Lam Suet, and Ka Tung Lam) in a bid to take down Simon Yam's Triad crime boss and have--yes--vengeance. Balletic gunplay, gorgeous cinematography, and strong performances anchor this above-average entry to To's canon. 4 out of 5 stars.",1295481600,5,818,5.204545454545454
4049398,4,B0031P6X84,"Out of 10 movies I rent from Netflix, 9 go back into the envelope after 10 minutes. Vengeance is different. First, the lead actor (Johnny Hallyday) is not Matt Damon or some other overexposed Hollywood actor. This guy looks sinister, yet has a heart. He has beautiful eyes, yet looks like Satan. His family is gunned down by Chinese thugs. He tells his daughter he's going to extract vengeance. There are several surprises, like the picnic scene. They wait til the wife and kids leave before starting a shootout. The cast is great and the direction is superb. There's a spiritual scene where Hallyday is praying and the souls of the dead rise out of the ocean. It appears that it's OK to get retribution but, hey, it's a movie.",1294444800,3,727,4.6
4049399,5,B0031P6X84,"My original plan was to save Vengeance for a weekend viewing with friends. Well, I have no problem watching it again and again. Once I peeked at some of it, I couldn't stop watching. This is full blown Johnnie To. After Costello's (Johnny Hallyday) daughter is almost murdered by triad gangsters who kill her family, he seeks revenge. The French chef with murder skills of his own hires three hitmen (Anthony Wong, Lam Ka Tung, and Lam Suet) to help him tackle mob boss George Fung (Simon Yam) and his team of expert killers. A friendship develops between the fab four as visions of Memento, Charles Bronson's Death Wish Series, All of Clint Eastwood's Westerns and some of To's films come to mind. You'll especially be reminded of The Mission and Exiled during the shootouts but that's okay. Vengeance is simply a great guy flick and pure heaven for Johnnie To fanatics like me. I get goosebumps every time I see Anthony Wong with trademark sunglasses, a cigarette in his mouth, and a gun in his hand. I also enjoyed the way English, French, and Cantonese languages are spoken together throughout the film. This really adds to it's international flavor. I had plenty of heated moments with Vengeance and look forward to repeated viewings of this instant classic. Now, I'd like to see Johnnie To and John Woo hook something new up with Chow Yun Fat, Andy Lau, Lau Ching Wan and all of To's players. That would be too much fun.",1294099200,9,1426,4.662698412698413
4049400,4,B0031P6X84,"The only Johnnie To film I've seen has been PTU which I liked a lot. ""Vengeance"" I liked almost a lot. As in many of the better Hong Kong crime thrillers, this has some clever turns and some nifty scenes. But this had a couple of plot points that wouldn't allow me to suspend my disbelief. They didn't kill it for me but it did hurt the movie a bit.

An innocent family of four is assassinated by some hit guys. Hubby is Asian. Mommy is French. Mom's dad comes from France to hire some guys to exact vengeance on the bad dudes. This is where it starts to get sticky. Instead of devising some clever way in which pops manages to locate some other hit guys to help him in his plight, he just happens to find them as they are finishing a hit in the hotel he happens to be staying at. Jeezo Peezo Batman! What are the chances!? That's probably the worst of it but there are a few other similar things that happen throughout.

This is very good though. What works is how a bond begins to grow between Frenchy and the three Chinese hit men. He cooks for them and they talk over food and wine. They get to know one another and a mutual respect grows. As the odds mount against them there is little question they are there for each other.

This is headed by some veteran Hon Kong Actors. Simon Yam, Suet Lam, Anthony Wong all do a decent job. The cinematography, action choreography and music are all stand up. I was a bit bothered by the fact that, in the big shoot out scene, To felt the need to put all the bad guys in dark rain slickers. Was he afraid we couldn't tell the difference? And, as always, the bad guys can't shoot as well as the good guys. But these are small quibbles. If you like Asian crime thrillers this is near the top of the pile.",1290124800,,1745,4.15680473372781
4049401,5,B0031P6X84,"When his daughter's family is murdered in an apparent Chinese mob hit, an aging French restauranteur promises to avenge her.  Knowing nothing of the language, he travels to Macau in search of the killers, and finds, instead, three hit men who are willing to help him in exchange for his life's savings and his restaurant.  Unexpected twists, comic turns, and surprisingly poignant moments, combine with Hong Kong director Johnnie To's stunning visual style to set this story apart from the conventional crime thriller.  Johnnie To always tweaks genre expectations, and here he infuses strong elements of the Western genre into the urban settings of Hong Kong and Macau.  A scene of darkened gunplay in a moonlit forest is one of the most visually thrilling and intense I've seen in a very long time.  While all the performances were memorable, Johnny Hallyday, with his enigmatic leathery face and penetratingly blue eyes, is perfectly cast as a quiet man coping with an increasingly apparent disability, but dead set on revenge.  While the film probes the meaning of vengeance and the nature of loyalty and honor in intriguing ways, it's also just a lot of fun to watch.  Highly recommended for lovers of inventive cinema.",1288310400,6,1223,5.024752475247524
4049402,2,B0031P6X84,"This movie is frustrating. The look, feel and acting all have an attractive style. There is a chemistry between the protagonists. There is lots of mood, good sets. But everything else unfortunately reeks of amateurish B grade film making - at best. This movie is defined cliche, nothing you haven't seen before in poor, low budget, poorly written movies. My guess is that all the good reviews come from fans who don't care too much because they just like the style and ""cool"" the actors ooze, including when they walk into ridiculous odds and come out victorious or knowing that certain death probably awaits them. It's sad that this film delves into looking and feeling silly.

Everything in this film is about ""honor"" yet none of it makes sense. Nobody is honorable but there is some type of contradictory code between hit men that we are supposed to admire. And they aren't really bad guys, just ordinary folks like you and me. Instead of making pizza or delivering mail, they kill people. Can't fault them for that, right? It's just a job. For all the ""crack"" shooting you see done by people who can't miss, it's amazing how often they do. I'm not sure if it's intentional but it's almost laughable how actors get shot, get hurt, pick themselves up off the pavement and carry on with their mission because this is what must happen in the movie. A man can't see faces clearly but he sure can shoot the lights out of a moving bicycle at 50 yards away.

The longer the movie rolls, the more it looks like a set on a stage. If you watch this movie to the end, all I can say is that ""if the jacket fit you can't acquit."" Unless you're a fan, this is just a lot of flash with a predictable plot that has no real purpose other than move the film to different sets for lots of gunplay. Waste of an opportunity.",1430784000,,1806,4.436746987951807

What a blast because from the twist forward, you have no control as far as figuring out what the outcome of this movie. If you like movies that are different and stand on their own merit, this movie is for you!

4049416,5,B0031P6X84,"I've seen at least 6-8 chinese and korean films with the same theme of revenge (the whole Park Chan-Wook series) and I thought this one would fall short of the greatness of those movies but it's actually a bit of a contender.

I'll start by letting you know it's not that much of a foreign film seeing as how our protagonist is returning to china from france so he speaks english and because of that everyone else does, barely do subtitles make an appearance. Within the first 3 minutes if your not hooked then you might be blind. This is the type of movie where dialogue is barely the motivating factor, only to reveal key things but for the most part the movie is entirely a visual joy ride. You can't listen to this movie, your eyes have to be and will most likely already be glued to the screen.

It's not just a gangster film, it has depth, it has substance, it will choke you up a bit because it involves child killings but boy was it good. Not too long, towards the climax you might have wished it would get to the point but it was worth every second spent.",1390176000,,1064,4.262376237623762

4049433,4,B0031P6X84,"""Vengeance"" (2009 release from Hong Kong; 109 min.) brings the story of Francis Costello (played by legendary French singer/actor Johnny Hallyday). Costello's daughter barely survives a brutal attack in her house in Macau, but her husband and 2 small children do not. Costello, a restaurant owner in Paris, immediately comes to Macau and in the hospital, his daughter begs him to ""revenge me"". Costello eventually hooks up with/hires three local hit men, and the search is on for the killers. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, the plot is pretty much secondary to the action in the movie. Hong Kong director Johnnie To brings the movie in a very stylish and visually catchy framework. Check out the gorgeous scenery of Macau (in the first half of the movie) and Hong Kong (later in the movie). Second, the performance from now old and grizzled Johnny Hallyday is outstanding. I realize that he is hardly known outside his native France and some other French-speaking regions in the worl such as Quebec and Belgium, but that guy is LEGENDARY, and he is still bringing it well into his sixties.

Bottom line: this is a violent (and hence, viewe beware) but stylish crime drama from Hong Kong. If this sounds like your cup of tea, do give this a try, I am quite sure you will not be disappointed.",1364169600,,1422,4.729838709677419

4049439,5,B0031P6X84,"People, people, enough with the ad hominem attacks. This is clearly not everyone's cup of tea. But here's why I think it's a great film:

Character Development. The 3 Chinese assassins are at first a readymade family - the 3 Stooges of murder, though this is lightly played, darkly humorous and perhaps familiar or even comfortable in an odd way. The addition of a French chef/retired assassin uncovers the strong ties that bind them, while at the same time beginning to heal the Frenchman even before the retribution begins. He's found people he can understand, even grudgingly like, if only on the basis of a shared career choice.

Uncovering Cultures at Odds: Johnnie To, the director, shows an urban landscape that at first might be Manhattan, pre-Disneyfication. The assassins  meet in a hotel that could be anywhere, but when the action moves to the streets, China shows another side to the Frenchman, exposing the thinness of his urbanity and cosmopolitanism. In the end it is family that ""saves"" the Frenchman. Indeed, Mr. To places family ahead of all, whether that family is a father and daughter or a band of brother assassins.

Finally, cinematography: Cheng Siu-Keung creates a city of harsh lights and deep shadows, clearly in homage to film noir, but not so much that of the 40's and 50, as a later Noir, like that of  Roman Polanski or Sam Peckinpah. There seems to be little studio work. Instead, Mr. To uses the city brilliantly to create the light, colour and shadow that propel his film.

I suppose there are some critics here who simply want more action and more violence. That, unfortunately, is today's taste. But if you want great storytelling, and virtuoso cinematography ""Vengeance"" won't disappoint.",1353542400,,1726,4.93448275862069
4049440,2,B0031P6X84,I was willing to ignore my disbelief at the beginning when the hit men let the chef/father live before he hired them. I found the film enjoyable enough until late in the film when it combined the unconvincing Memento riff and the ludicrously suicidal shoot out in the dump. They had chosen to flee when they were outnumbered in a tenement where they actually had cover and multiple opportunities to ambush and withdraw but later the three of them take on dozens in the dump shoot out instead of retreating for another day on better ground. And they don't simply stand their ground in the open; they advance so they can be encircled. Ludicrous!,1345852800,,643,4.649122807017544
4049441,5,B0031P6X84,"SPOILERS WITHIN!

After reading other peoples reviews of this film, and now having seen it my second time, I find that I really, really enjoy this film more so now after having a much better appreciation for its characters and its subtle but still, in your face, Hitman meets Silverado meets Momento. Much of the movie centers around the main character Costello (played by Johnny Hallyday) which you get a very good sense of the direction hes going even with the minor twists that you learn about half way through the film in which he basically cant remember much as things go on due to a bullet to the brain. Johnny Hallyday does a remarkable job in this role and slowly reveals more about the main character as the movie rolls on.

Sylvie Testud who plays the daughter of the lead character is still one of my favorite Foreign actresses (between her and Kristin Scott Thomas) who show a much better talent between bi-lingual roles. Her role was very pivotal as she was one of the three reasons as to why Johnny's character went on his tear, although short, it was very well played out.

There are times where the movie was not as action-y as I had hoped, but the action scenes were still enough that I thoroughly enjoyed the film.

All in all, it was a great movie, with plenty to keep you going.

With it's surreally engaging visuals such as falling rain, umbrellas in Macau streets, blowing paper, falling leaves, cloud darkening moon, flashes of gunfire then to have all that accompanied by precise sound effects, sublime music alternating with periods of silence, melting into a visually surreal story. Further, when adding the loss of memory storyline it became reminiscent of Dark City, Blade Runner and some early Sergio Leone westerns.

A criticism is that some of the shooting scenes (perhaps intended) seemed a bit comical or spoofy.",1306454400,,792,5.2362204724409445

4049451,4,B0031P6X84,"I am no expert on Johnnie To films.  Amazon matched my interest in martial arts, Seven Samari and Magnificent Seven with a recommendation for J. To's  ""Vengeance"".  Apparently, it's quite dificult to obtain.  There was only one copy available at Amazon, I had to wait weeks and it came with a sticky note with handwritten notations.  We were intrigued by the the intrigue.

Now , down to the brass tacks:  It was an amazing film, totallly out of our zone of familiarity but 100 percent amazing!  Yes, you have to concentrate, a Lot.  Yes, the actors, characters and plot are foreign and puzzling.  BUT, the payoff for staying tuned and keeping pace are well worth the intellectual leap.

It is a story of revenge but it is not a silly story.  It is a story of someone who really MUST even the score.  Johnnie To is oddly sexy, tragic and crazy.  His intellectual and fighting skills are equally matched.  Physically, he is one of the most visually interesting characters in modern cinema--he is very tall (like Clint Eastwood), very thin and racially, very ambiguous (maybe French and Asian).  Morally, he is without ambiguity...he has a single purpose and he executes his purpose with satisfying efficiency.

It's hard to get but get it!",1303776000,2,1238,4.764150943396227

He had a great career in a France as a singer in his younger days, and proved his acting ability in that film and the original ""The Man on the Train"".  He puts in a solid performance of a one time hit man,  now  a chef at his own restaurant, who comes to Macau to avenge the murder of his daughter's family.  By accident he meets up with a trio of hitmen and hires them to help him find the man responsible for the murders.  Slowly, the Chinese trio grow to like him and do indeed help him.  In the end a different sort of revenge is done.  I was swept away by the fine acting by all in the movie.  Made in Macau and Hong Kong.",1505260800,,703,3.9642857142857144
8387155,4,B0031P6X84,"A mysterious French restaurant owner's daughter and her family are gunned down in their own house.  He promises his daughter he will get vengeance.  This is a nice mixture of Cantonese and French (with English subtitles) that becomes an English language film for the most part after the French guy finds some Cantonese hit men, and obviously English is the common second language spoken. It was a little confusing at times, I wasn't exactly sure for a while what country the French guy's daughter were murdered and resided in, was it France or were we in China (Macau or Hong Kong like other events take place in). But that doesn't matter.  The story is different to your usual hit man film, or revenge film for that matter. The French guy also has a bullet lodged in his brain from before events in the movie so is losing his memory.  At times it's not realistic, but I don't know that it was trying to be. I'm pretty sure the hit men would have killed the French guy before he hired them.  The hit men and the restaurant owner can keep a bicycle both upright and moving by shooting it, but seem to have trouble shooting rival hit men out in the open for example. But none of this matters when you're having fun.",1496102400,,1213,4.445945945945946

8387157,5,B0031P6X84,"Another astonishing crime thriller from Johnnie To, who must be the greatest action director alive. And yet he finds time amid the carnage for subtle character portraits and moments of surprising tenderness.

8387158,5,B0031P6X84,"If this were just a revenge movie, I would have been disappointed---unless I was perceptive enough to see what Johnnie To was bringing to his film.  The story itself was about a French chef (and former assassin) whose daughter was severely injured in a Chinese mob hit.  His son-in-law and grandchildren weren't as fortunate, brutally cut down for no apparent reason.  This became Costello's motivation to hunt down their killers.

The twists and turns in this movie made it into the ""perfect storm"".  As the story progressed, bad men were pressed into making decisions that they could live with, even if it proved disastrous for them.  Some would call it ""honor among thieves"", others might call it living with a code, and yet someone else might refer to it as doing the right thing.  In any event, hard choices are made, allegiances shift as necessary, and surprising friendships are forged.  Johnnie To compounds all of this morality play by making Costello a sympathetic hero, suffering a traumatic brain injury from previously being shot in the head.  As his memory fades, his compatriots make allowances and adjustments for him in order for him to succeed at his tasks.  Very interesting twist effectively worked into the story line.

Combine the best action scenes from DEATH WISH, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, and THE WILD BUNCH;  add in the impeccable timing of THE DROP, paint your scenes with colors and textures as only the Chinese/Japanese seem to do, and turn your movie into a violent morality story---the result is VENGEANCE.  Watch it closely, listen to the dialogue, pay attention to the scenery, examine the motivation of the characters, and you will understand what Johnnie To was trying to bring to the screen.  And he succeeds!",1444262400,,1756,4.948805460750854
8387159,5,B0031P6X84,"I liked this film because of the way the story developed with its many periods of silence. A man was a gunman some twenty years ago, and now owns a restaurant and is a chef. He learns that his daughter was shot and near death, and her husband and two children are killed. He does not know why they were killed or who did it. He swears vengeance. By coincidence he sees three gunman kill a woman and her lover, follows them, and offers to give them all the money he has as well as his home and restaurant if the three will help him find the murderers of his family and the man that hired them. They agree.
He has a problem. Some time back, he was shot in the head and was told by his doctor that this will soon cause him to have amnesia. He takes pictures of the three men so that he can remember them.
There is a lot of shooting in the film and much conversation in Chinese with subtitle, but I did not find this distracting.",1440720000,,925,4.060109289617486
8387160,4,B0031P6X84,"Vengeance (2009)

 Hong Kong director Johnnie To has made more than 30 films but this is my first of his films.  The exuberance and craft of this action flick struck me.  The imagination thrown into this film by director To and writer Ka-Fai Wai delights and astonishes the Western viewer.  As director or writer this pair of seasoned pros have between them built about 70 movies.  Their experience shows.
 Two French actors were hired by the Hong Kong film makers.  Actor and rock and roll star Johnny Hallyday plays Costello, a French chef.  Sylvie Testud has the role of the chef's daughter.  The daughter, her children and her husband are slaughtered by Chinese gangsters.  The chef-father swears revenge.  What follows is a more or less conventional shoot'um up with scenes in Hong Kong and Macau.  The father hires three gangsters to help him find and dispatch his daughter's murders.
 The durable gangsters can take a lot of punishment.  When people get shot puffs of fine red mist appear, which if not all that realistic certainly is colorful.  We have the treat of long, involved shoot outs with lots of bullets flying around.
 All in all, I liked this somewhat fantastic crime-thriller a lot.  Do not think of the Godfather but more of a fast fun ride with lots of interesting visual effects.  The makers throw in an unusual plot twist about the chef which I liked and some innovative battle scenes as well as a bit of off the wall mysticism.
 Not rated but would get an R for violence and a couple of people shot to shreds while having vigorous sex.
 I need to watch more Hong Kong movies if just for the wow factor of seeing very imaginative films.",1438041600,,1660,4.635738831615121
