8353246,5,B0026MS3OU,"This short film from 1984 offers a loving family in which a young boy named Steve (Stephan Szpak-Fleet) and his father(Robert Fleet) enjoy each others company  in a comfortable and humorous manner. Do to an unfortunate problem, young Steve wanders off to get water and is separated from his father. Steve finds himself ""adopted"" by a hybrid wolf and eventually finds some nicer humans to help him. Steve also encounters the worse in people with a meeting of greedy gold miners, This too is overcome by this smart little boy, and Mara (the wolf/dog).

The California mountain locations are beautiful as well as a very nice rustic musical score, and some nice natural acting by the cast and Mara.

A perfect film for a family audience with young children who are less impressed with special effects, and may enjoy a film which the whole family may discuss after viewing. I recommend this film completely.",1392163200,,902,4.8441558441558445
8353247,1,B0026MS3OU,I'm sorry to be writing this and I am even more sorry for having wasted $14 on a HUGE dud. This movie was horrible! I walked away halfway through the movie it was so bad. I could not handle any more of it. The kid couldn't be doing that dialogue... and these are some of the worst actors I have seen. Ultimately I did not even care what happened in the film because it was so unbelievable I could not believe these people were having bad times to begin with. Don't waste your money or time.,1371513600,,490,4.114583333333333
8353248,4,B0026MS3OU,"My kids enjoyed watching the low-budget movie. It's very sweet and innocent. Some really nice nature photography. I didn't know places like this still exist. Oh, yea, this is an old movie. It's probably all developed now with townhouses and strip malls!",1369872000,,253,5.0476190476190474
8353249,1,B0026MS3OU,"That's a negative one star, folks. We first watched this movie (by mistake!) when it first came out. We actually watched the whole thing because it was so funny (not on purpose, mind you). But once we got started, we just had to see what happened next. The filming was completely cheesy. The slow-mo in the last scenes had us laughing so hard we cried. The ""wolf"" attacking the bad guys was particularly memorable (not!). Have you ever seen a little kid with a stuffed animal held to their throat pretending to be attacked? Yea, well that's it. And the narrator.... he's in the movie, then dies... but keeps narrating. How does that work? I did just buy this ridiculous movie, cause we've been wanting to laugh again. But I don't seriously know if I can sit all the way through it. Good luck to the unsuspecting!",1257465600,,812,4.530612244897959
