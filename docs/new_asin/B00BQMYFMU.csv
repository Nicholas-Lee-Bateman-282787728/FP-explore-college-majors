8572737,5,B00BQMYFMU,"I have watched ""It Started with a Kiss"" and this series twice.  I almost feel like I know the characters.  Great development of all the characters.  I highly recommend watching the beginning dvd before ""They Kiss Again"".  I have watched the Japanese and Korean versions and for me this is the best.  Joe Cheng and Ariel Lin are ""magic"" together.  The story is classic.",1396483200,,368,4.671875
8572738,5,B00BQMYFMU,"Love this series and its sequel and the stars. For those who have queries about the ending-apparently the original author of the manga died before finishing the tale therefore the Taiwanese version decided to leave it incomplete like the manga. However the animated Japanese version Itzunara na kiss did complete it - Spoiler alert in backets below!! On another note the boxset for Kiss 2 I received did not look like DVD originals, the screen is small and not good quality like the first season. Is it the same everywhere and a waste of time to replace it?

(SPOILER ALERT  She was pregnant with a girl but there is no night blindness disease in that version.)",1391990400,,661,4.689655172413793
8572739,5,B00BQMYFMU,"After seeing ""It Started with a Kiss""  I thought it was great, I really wanted to see ""They Kissed Again""  and if I may say I was not disappointed it was excellent.  If there is another sequel to this one I want to be the first  person to purchase it.",1381017600,,251,3.96

8572741,5,B00BQMYFMU,"They Kiss Again Taiwan Tv Drama is Excellent! A must watch for all ""Playful Kiss Korean Tv Drama fans"". This is the complete story of how the Korean Drama version Playful Kiss should have ended. I'm a die hard fan of ""Playful Kiss the Korean Tv Drama"" with Oh Ha Ni & Baek Sung Yu. However, when I saw It Started with a Kiss & They Kissed Again Taiwan Tv Drama it became number one in my Drama Fever Series. Its the complete story of Xiaxing & Xishu love story plus the untold story not given in the Korean Drama versiob unless you go to You Tube Special Edition Playful Kiss Korean Tv Drama. I Love Xiaxing & Xishu very much. They stoled my heart. Sorry Oh Ha Ni & Baek Sung Yu, Xishu was meaner and colder and it took him a long time to find his feelings for Xiaxing. Plus Xiaxing went through a lot of pain, humiliation, and suffering more than Oh Ha Ni. Also I can say the Korean Playful Kiss Tv Drama kept the series Teenage orientated and changed a lot of the adult context from the original Manga books. This also why Xiaxing & Xishu stoled my heart because it followed the story from The Manga Series ""Itazura Na Kiss"". A Must have Collection for All Playful Kiss Fans Tv Drama. ""They Kissed Again"", and of course the first part of this series: ""It Started with A Kiss"". Excellent series!",1374451200,3,1296,4.272357723577236
