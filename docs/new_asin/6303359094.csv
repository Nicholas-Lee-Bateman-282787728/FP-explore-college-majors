632481,5,6303359094,"This is a great movie about the American Indians and AIM taking over The Knee in 73.

I just wish those big wigs in the ivory towers at Turner Broadcasting would get around to transfering this great movie onto DVD.

Grrr",1095724800,10,220,4.341463414634147
632482,5,6303359094,"This is a good story that bears re-telling, as all stories of injustice do. The pacing is good and it doesn't get preachy...well not too preachy. The sad story of what misguided but probably well-intentioned Catholic missionary schools did to Native Americans is touched on. That could be a movie in itself. The hopelessness of life on the reservation is effectively shown, too.
Of course, the main story is the stand-off at Wounded Knee, and Mary's ""hovering on the edge"" presence is an interesting way to tell the story. Some male chauvinist attitudes are apparent among the leaders of AIM, but the more traditional Native American respect for the words of women asserts itself through Mary's and the other women's strong stand.
Irene Bedard gives an unself-conscious protrayal of Mary Crow Dog which effectively captures the viewer's empathy rather than sympathy. All the other actors give warm dignified protrayals that let the story speak for itself. An interesting unbilled appearance by Peter Weller as a straight-talking Army man provides some slightly comic relief. His short scene shows the smallness and mean spiritedness of the supposed upholders of the law. A good film to show in a class as material to spark a discussion of human rights.",1026345600,54,1252,5.08252427184466
632483,5,6303359094,"This movie is one of the greatest I have ever watched. It really reflects the changing times we as Native American people have endured and still endure. This movie has awaken so many of the Non-Indians as to what really happen at little Big Horn, and how our struggle for soverignity is so vital to us as a people. Yah Wey!",1014940800,20,323,4.311475409836065
632484,4,6303359094,"When I saw this movie, I was not aware of the American Indian Movement at all. I did not have a clue about the struggles of American Indian peoples at all (and I live in Oklahoma which considering the American Indian population here, that is pretty sad). This movie woke me out of all that. I went on to read the book Lakota Woman and realized the parts that were left out or creatively licensed in the film to enhance the drama, but it was still a good movie. I thought that Irene Bedard did a great job as did many others of the cast and crew. This movie raised my consciousness and led me to become involved in a Native American club for five years. Even though I am not with them anymore, this movie will always remain close to my heart as one that caused me to become more aware. I definitely recommend both the movie and the book.",1009497600,63,836,4.198757763975156
632485,5,6303359094,I saw this movie on cable for the first time almost 4 years ago when I was about 17.  I tried to record it.  My recording...... and has missing parts but it's been my favorite movie still.  After I had to read the book about Mary because the movie made me so interested in the Lakota culture and my own culture as a native Californian with a lost ancestry.  I'm now buying the movie and can't wait to see the real movie with all parts!  This movie inspired me to find my culture and embrace the truth as hard as it is.  I hope it could do the same for all.,986774400,11,556,3.963963963963964
632486,5,6303359094,A fascinating insight into what happened at Wounded Knee in 1973. This film is particularly usefull for those who are unaware of this important part of American history and wish to know more. When watching this film I felt I was there and subsequently read more on the subject and even spoke to individuals who were there realising how brave and isolated these indians were in their quest for justice. This movie is a keeper.,977702400,7,425,4.68
7844719,4,6303359094,"I only watch Lakota Woman, because of the handsome Pato Hoffmann, his voice is the same and he is a great actor is in this movie.  The story is about a lady mixing with the AIM. Great story.",1444089600,,190,4.0

7844722,5,6303359094,"Being from the mid west and also being part native American I am drawn to this movie.
I recorded it off the t.v. years ago but my tape wore out and I am wondering if they are ever going to have it out on dvd.
I wouldn't mind having it on vhs, but there is no way I would pay  what the vhs is priced at, I'll just wait for the dvd., but for goodness sakes don't make us wait long.
Amazon needs to try to get it out on dvd, or make it themselves.
Great movie, way over two hours long,( I can't remember how long for sure), but if it ever comes out on dvd you won't be disappointed.
Come on amazon, get it out on dvd for us soon !  ( original full screen is what I would like.)",1389830400,,674,3.73943661971831
7844723,5,6303359094,"And here is yet another one of the films which should be digitally restored and released on DVD. This film helps immensely to understand what was happening during the siege of Wounded Knee and Irene Bedard's performance as the Lakota Woman is unforgettable.
Is there anybody out there???",1372550400,3,287,5.0
7844724,5,6303359094,"Transfer to DVD Please - Thankyou - Lakota Woman is an excellent movie that should be made available to us as a DVD.

It tells the story of American Indians from many Nations, and The American Indian Movement and their fight for Indian Rights in America against the corrupt governments, both U.S. and NDN.

I love this movie and hope someday it will be available to us on DVD.",1291248000,4,376,4.434782608695652

7844726,5,6303359094,"I cried twice while watching this movie for the first time - I felt so frustrated.  The situation is still the same today as my nephews and niece struggle in our society, between worlds, trying to find their identity.  When will our country become truly great and admit its wrongs to the Nations and Hawaiians?

I agree that turner should release this as a DVD - I was unable to purchase it today because their film distributor does not carry it and could not give me a number of someone to speak with at Turner Broadcasting.  The fact that this film is so hard to find is a testament to the truth itself.",1241654400,4,605,4.327433628318584
7844727,5,6303359094,"This movie is an excellent dramatization of the book and the events.  So many movies about Native Americans end in 1890.  This movie shows the life of a contemporary Native American girl/woman and the continuing Native American struggle for land, dignity, respect and human rights.

As Daniel White Hat said, ""This isn't history.  It's still with us.""",1120003200,7,351,5.105263157894737
7844728,5,6303359094,"This movie touches on more aspects of Native American struggles and suffering, both in the past and in the present, than any other movie that I have seen about Native Americans.  Irene Bedard is wonderful as Mary Crow Dog.  If you haven't seen this movie, please check it out.  It will really raise your awareness about what Native Americans have been through and what many are still going through.  It is really saddening that this movie has not been released on DVD yet.  I hope that they decide to take that step someday soon.",1102032000,8,529,4.585106382978723
