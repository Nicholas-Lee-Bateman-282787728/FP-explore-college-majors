8424231,4,B004CZZZ72,"Video quality is quite good and presented in letterbox format.  This film is considered of director's Nicholas Ray's least successful ventures and the movie seems haphazardly edited.  At a running time of 88 min one can justly assume many scenes were left on the cutting room floor.  According to Nicholas Rays biographers, he left the production allowing the studio to supervising the editing -- a true shame).  One scene omitted was the arrest of Jane Russell's character, along with the rest of her family in a gas station.  Photos of the scene can be found on the web and it looks like it would have been a rowdy fun scene with Jane putting up a fight with the officers including her even spraying one of them down with gasoline hose (would be wonderful to see a restored ""director's cut"").  That said, all the cast give good performances, despite both Russell and Cornel Wilde were too old for their roles, especially since in the gypsy culture an unwed woman in her 30s might would raise red-flag that she might be a con-artist. Also, the dancing of the two leads is awkwardly edited and obvious professional dancers were used in long-shots.",1520640000,,1147,4.738693467336684
8424232,3,B004CZZZ72,"Colorful , whimsical , silly gypsy fun . The fine Luther Adler adds the modest amount of heft this production needs in order to rationalize it's very existence . Portraying the older brother to Cornel Wilde's hot blooded , fantastic dancing and responsibility shirking sibling as well as being the ""King"" of a Serbian gypsy community located in an unnamed urban location  , Alder's delivers a pretty swell performance .
The film itself is a preposterous fantasy that's not meant to be taken too seriously . It's pleasant but ridiculous and tries to be a number of different films all at once . Interesting curiosity for fans of Mr. Wilde (Edge Of Eternity , The Naked Prey , The Greatest Show On Earth , Road House) and Ms. Russell .",1496966400,,733,4.638461538461539
8424233,1,B004CZZZ72,Nick Ray was one of the pioneers of widescreen and the film was shot in Cinemascope (and it screams it on the package). Why do this? Only film buffs and Nicholas Ray enthusiasts would have an interest in the title. And they would know that this isn't the way to present the film. Shame.,1401753600,4,286,4.314814814814815
8424234,3,B004CZZZ72,"This is a typical romantic pic with Lots of fighting, romance and lovers quarrels but nothing really special except Jane Russell herself.",1302307200,2,137,5.2727272727272725
