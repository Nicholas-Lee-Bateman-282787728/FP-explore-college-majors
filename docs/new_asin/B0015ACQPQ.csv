8257989,2,B0015ACQPQ,"This DVD is not what is described in the product description.

I'd estimate that less than 1/5 of this is actually about the bioogy of fear.

The rest is a mix of new age crap (she say's she has 6 1/2 billion people in her head and many of them haven't actually lived yet) and extreme Christian Propoganda.

I gave 2 stars only becuase a bit of the intro actually pertained to Fear and the Brain.",1276128000,2,396,4.184210526315789
8257990,5,B0015ACQPQ,"Since fear is the root of all of our limitations, then anyone who truly wishes to make positive change in their life should watch this first.

I have been a fan of Wayne Dyer for years and of how well he speaks to his audience.  Its my opinion that JZ Knight rivals him in this respect. Ms Knight is not only articulate, but she gives us the scientific tools to help make sense of those esoteric ideas that the holistic community is constantly presenting to us.

This video is a must have for anyone who wishes to make personal improvements (by leaps and bounds) in their life or to anyone who might be an adviser or counsel to someone else.",1235952000,10,641,4.325
8257991,5,B0015ACQPQ,"This DVD is packed with brain power!  JZ shows you where the fear center is in your brain and how to overcome that part of your brain.  Now! It isn't going to be easy but we have to do the work if we want to change ourselves and dream a better world for all human kind. Continuing the journey onward and upward.  I would suggest you purchase everything you can by Ramtha or JZ Knight.  They are Great Teachers!
