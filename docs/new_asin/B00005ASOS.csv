1417709,3,B00005ASOS,"This is the first silent film I've seen that has a fitting musical score. Amazon is unclear as to what version this is, so I'll just have to assume we're all talking about the Timothy Brock score (1995). It matches the plot and action note-for-note, unlike some other silent films that seem to feature a random mood piece in the background.

As far as the film itself, you will be blown away for the first 20 minutes. The visuals are downright chilling (especially the memorable entrance of Mephisto), and the plot is faithful to the original legend as it was penned by Goethe. But something happens halfway through that I'm not sure what to make of. Murnau turns Mephisto into a slapstick comedian (which one other reviewer has compared to a Laurel & Hardy... I'd say more Lou Costello, myself). The film never quite recovers from this, and it loses its dark edge. Adding insult to injury is the rather unconvincing romance thrown in.

It's definitely worth a watch for the music, technique and nostalgia. It helps also if you can avoid comparing it to the original legend of Faust.",1115078400,13,1083,4.6947368421052635
1417710,5,B00005ASOS,"For all intents and purposes, this is THE silent film to own, if one can own just one.  It has everything.  Drama, special effects, comedy, allegory, myth, good vs evil.  Murnau is a director par excellence and displays his visionary propensities to splendid effect in this classic Goethe tale.  The inimitable Emil Jannings plays a hearty, red-blooded Mephisto. Jannings as a silent screen actor invokes in one look, or a singular movement, what some contemporary actors could not hope to capture within a fete of endless dialogue.  Camilla Horn plays a heartbreaking Gretchen, and the scene in which she wanders the snow with her dying baby is as evocative as it gets.  Grab a hankie and do not feel shamed to find yourself swept along for the ride, of which there is a most splendid one included in this film, where Faust and Mephisto glide above a world in miniature.  Amazing, exhilarating, absorbing.  You shan't be disappointed.",1087776000,5,935,4.910828025477707
1417711,5,B00005ASOS,"Do you know that many older people dream all or in part in black and white?  Our dreams (and perhaps that is what movies are) were framed by our visions of movies and TV. Murnau's, ""Faust"" is one of those visual images that sets in your mind and comes forward when you reflect on movies.  It is that good, it is that powerful.  Like his later movie, ""Sunrise,"" Faust is a visual feast that is more colorful in black and white than it could possibly be in color. (I ALWAYS maintain that Kurosawa is more colorful in b-&-w than in color)
The story is simple. It is the story of Faust, a man who sells his soul to the Devil.  The movie does slow down in the middle. But the imagry of the beginning and the end are worthy of the finest film crafting of all time.
I taught histoy for many years and an important facet of history is getting and understanding of where the world of today came from. We have cars because 100 years ago people grew fond ofr cars. We have airplanes because 100 years ago people grew to want planes.  And we have movies because 100 years ago people made them part of their lives.  Faust is one of those beautiful works of art that people love then and can still admire today.
Praise goes to Kino for producing a clear well scored DVD of a work of art for us to study and admire.",1068681600,4,1300,4.18
1417712,5,B00005ASOS,"I'm not a silent film buff. But the story of Faust was enough of a temptation. The black and white photography, alone, makes this worth watching. The textures, gray tones, and authentic and artistic style kept me a captive audience. The orchestral soundtrack is something you would expect from Wagner. All in all, an excellent viewing experience.",1065312000,18,346,5.087719298245614
1417713,4,B00005ASOS,"Having watched Nosferatu recently, I've developed a bit of a Murnau ""thing"", and Faust has done nothing to dampen this. In some ways it's a similar film - figuratively, Mephisto is not unlike Dracula, and the use of the plague metaphor for societal decay is used in both films. Over 115 minutes Faust is neither even nor coherent enough to be in the same league as Nosferatu, though. The individual set pieces, however, thoroughly outdo anything in Murnau's Stoker adaptation.

The special effects are rudimentary, but boy do they pack some bang for their buck. The camerawork and heavily shadowed lighting lends a sombre and dreamy air to proceedings, and there are certain images, particularly at the beginning of the picture, which are astounding: Murnau's representation of the plague and Faust's invocation of the Devil (it reminded me of the strikingly similar Robert Johnson legend) are especially memorable scenes.
For all that, the middle of the film loses momentum badly. This is mostly not Murnau's fault: the Faust legend doesn't, when you analyse it, make for awfully good cinema. The dramatic impetus is done at the end of the first act. Once Faust has made his pact, it's game over; the rest of the story is just the slow revelation of the enormity of what Faust has done.
Murnau has a go at modifying this to make for a better screenplay, but it doesn't work.  The Faust/Gretchen love interest isn't enough to hold up the last hour of the film, and bizarrely (given the decidedly unsettling opening scenes) Emil Jannings plays Mephisto not for dread but for laughs. I suppose that's the only way the Faust story has any credibility - we can believe that a beguiling trickster might pull a fast one on the fundamentally decent Faust, but not a horrible Satanic Majesty. But I don't think that is an excuse to turn the Devil into Oliver Hardy.
In his attempt to pull a happy ending out of the Hat (Goethe and Marlow don't have a happy ending, Faust scholars will note), Murnau eschews his slapstick for good old fashioned incoherence: Mephisto and Faust take leave of the screen altogether and Gretchen goes postal, things get very maudlin - to what point, your guess is as good as mine - and, rather abruptly (given how the last 30 minutes dragged) it's all over.
Just as there is for the new edition of Nosferatu, there is a commentary track prepared by an Australian actor with a comedy baritone voice. It isn't quite so insightful, however.
Well worth a watch, but you are left wondering what might have been.",1060041600,6,2527,4.767123287671233
1417714,5,B00005ASOS,"As is to be expected of a great director, (F.W. Murnau, ""Nosferatu"", ""The Man Who Laughs""), ""Faust"" delivers a brilliant adaption of this classic story concerning the perennial subject of good versus evil. Though, not apparently the first telling of this story, (IMDB lists 5 previous films with this title), it's perhaps, (to my knowledge) the oldest surviving version available.  Its brilliance deserves preservation.
In a world struggling against pestilence, famine, and disease Mephisto decides he can attempt a hostile take-over through a real estate deal.  The Archangel Michael agrees, that if Mephisto can win Faust over to his side, he gets the kit and kaboodle.  Faust is a tired old doctor/alchemist who is disappointed at his inability to offer healing to those with the rampant-running plague.  Soon, he calls on Mephisto and strikes up a deal with him.  Mephisto gives him youth and pleasures of the world, until Faust falls for a simple girl.
This film is brilliantly done, with fantastic effects and brilliant storytelling.  Some scenes are downright eerie, like Mephisto standing over the town with ravens wings.  Emil Jennings plays a brilliant Mephisto, somewhere between the brilliant humor of mythical Loki and the dark evil vision of Zarathrustra's Angra Mainyu.  Gsta Ekman is brilliant as Faust as well, from withered old man to young libertine, he shows talent rarely seen on the screen in recent time.
Though there aren't a lot of features on this disc, (including a nice photo gallery, a link to Kino's website, and scene selection), the print is beautiful for its age, and the music recently recorded and very appropriate.  The price is a little high, but your not purchasing a sad copy for a few bucks, but a  masterpiece both in original content and painstaking preservation.  This film is worthy of being in any collection interest in great filmmaking.",1046649600,78,1883,5.100977198697068
1417715,5,B00005ASOS,"This film is ripe for reassessment as among the best silent films ever made and a true work of art.  Unfortunately, most silent films are rarely seen outside of a small group of silent film enthusiasts.  Murnau's earlier film ""Nosferatu"" is an exception, mainly because horror genre fans brought it to the attention of a wider audience. So ""Nosferatu,"" a relatively immature low-budget work, receives all the attention, while ""Faust,"" in every way beyond it, is not nearly so well-known simply because it doesn't fall neatly into a genre.
""Faust"" features a stylish dream-like atmosphere punctuated with stunning special effects and lush visuals.  Of course, this will not be to everyone's taste.  Those looking for realistic straightforward storytelling may find it tedious or silly.  I would say that ""Faust"" will appeal to fans of surreal ""cult"" films, ones that create their own unique allegorical world, such as ""Brazil,"" ""Dark City,"" ""The City of Lost Children,"" ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Metropolis,"" and the films of Jean Cocteau.  In fact, the general atmosphere of Faust is most similar to Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"" -- the young version of Faust reminds me of the Prince the Beast becomes.  On a slightly lighter note, ""Faust"" should also appeal to fans of cult television shows like ""The Avengers,"" ""The Prisoner,"" and ""Twin Peaks.""  I would even expect it to appeal to fans of classic Disney animation.
For a silent film of its day, the picture quality on ""Faust"" is very good.  There is some slight unrepaired damage early on, but the picture quality becomes increasingly pristine as the film progresses.  Of course, its certainly not as good-looking as a modern film nor those few silent films where the original negatives survive, but its certainly far better looking than ""Nosferatu,"" where only a single so-so print survived. I think most people will be pleasantly surprised at just how good this looks.  If the film ever finds the audience it deserves, enough to justify a thorough clean-up with modern digital techniques, I imagine that this film could look even more spectacular.  The soundtrack consists of an excellent orchestral score.
Silent films being a cult in themselves, its doubly hard when their subject is also of mainly cult appeal.  I hope ""Faust"" can break out of the straightjacket of silent films.  It deserves to be ranked not just as among the best silent films, but as a classic film period.",996710400,54,2437,5.029850746268656
1417716,4,B00005ASOS,"Kino has just released the new DVD stroboscopic light show from the silent German era, ""Faust"", directed by Friedrich Wilhelm Plumpe, or F.W. Murnau. Adding onto his success with ""Nosferatu"", Murnau and UFA, the giant German studio, decided to spare no expense. There's no CGI here. But there is an impressive use of light, shadow, and wind, that includes a fantasy ride with the devil. The classic Goethe tale from 1926, Faust sells his soul to the devil when he is told: ""Go to the crossroads, and call his name 3 times"".  The smoky,windy,moon-lit set fortells Murnau's ""Sunrise"", the classic filmed in Hollywood one year later. In 1927, Fox Pictures erected a huge city set on miles of open land, for ""Sunrise"". It's now covered by condominiums and known as Century City. ""Faust"" features Muranu's wistful direction, Camilla Horn as young Gretchen, and Emil Jannings as Mephisto. Just one year later, all three would be working in Hollywood. The second half of ""Faust"" bogs down with Gretchen's problems, and her brother's death. The brother is played by William Dieterle, a future Hollywood director. ""Faust"" has a large print cut 3 1/2 minutes into the film, and some serious negative print damage in the reel change from 2 to 3. Otherwise, the DVD is rather pristine for an 80 year-old film. F.W. Murnau died in a possibly scandalous car crash in 1931, in Santa Barbara, rushing to the premiere of his last film, ""Tabu"".",994723200,8,1426,4.868312757201646
1417717,5,B00005ASOS,"Murnau's interpretation of Goethe's brilliant epic is by far his best film. Ever overshadowed by the more popular ""Nosferatu,"" ""Faust"" shows a creativity and ingenuity rarely seen in film making since. Murnau's genius shines through every shot of the film.
Emil Jannings, a staple of German expressionist film, steals the show as Mephistopheles capturing perfectly the malicious glee which Goethe depicted. Camilla Horn is the perfect tragic figure in the role of Gretchen, amazingly pulling off the character's fall into insanity. Gsta Eckman, though the least memorable of the three, plays Faust well, clearly illustrating his arrogance and intelligence.
It is, however, Murnau himself who truly makes the film shine. From Mephistopheles' unleashing of the plague to Gretchen's wanderings in the snow, every shot is magic. His use of effects far beyond their time is not overbearing but truly effective in illustrating the story. It is honestly his best film, far outclassing the rest.
Kino has done a nice job in its distribution and restoration of the film. The orchestral soundtrack fits the film for the most part and the transfer was done well, leaving a very enjoyable silent film.
I could not recommend this film more.",992476800,7,1227,5.233502538071066
1417718,4,B00005ASOS,"This is an amazing silent film from the German Expressionist movement. Emil Jannings is great, but the visual design steals the show! Director Murnau produces a world of darkness and mystery. Watch Faust's fantasy ride with the devil and you realize this may have been the inspiration for some of Disney's classics -- especially the Night on Bald Mtn. segment of Fantasia. I'm excited to recommend this forgotten gem from a great director who was lost too early. The DVD is from superb source materials (as is the case with most of David Shepard's work), but the sound track is weak.  Most of it is tolerable, but there are moments when it really creaks.

1417747,5,B00005ASOS,"Faust,"" directed by F.W. Murnau, based on the play of the same name by Goethe and the play The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe, ranks with Metropolis as one of the greatest achievements of German silent cinema. Gosta Ekman stars as the title alchemist who, struggling with his faith in the midst of a devastating plague, is offered the power to cure and the gift of youth in exchange for his soul. Mephisto (Emil Jannings, The Last Laugh) is seen earlier wagering with an angel (Werner Fettered) that he can destroy the soul of anyone, even the beneficent Prof. Faust. Jannings provides an intense performance which ranges from charming to comical to horrifying.

The deliberate artificiality of the expressionistic set design suggests a netherworld in which the Devil uses his wiles to lure mortals with transitory gratification, knowing that ultimately their souls will be his. The lighting design contributes to an ominous, forbidding atmosphere that elicits chills.

Murnau put his cast through rigorous filming in order to achieve some incredible visuals. In one memorable scene, he had Jannings stand for hours while three powerful fans blew clouds of soot to make his cloak billow twelve feet above his head. Camille Horn, playing the lovely Gretchen, had to endure hours tied to a stake with flames raging around her from 20 burners.

This 1926 work holds up today largely because of its sheer epic nature. With numerous references to Dutch, German and Italian painting, the film reflects painstaking detail and a lavish budget. Faust was Murnaus last film in Germany before he came to the United States to make Sunrise.

The Blu-ray release contains a digitally restored print in HD from 35-mm archival elements. There are two soundtrack options: a piano score adapted from the 1926 orchestral arrangement by Paul Hensel, and an orchestral score by The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. Also included is The Language of Shadows: Faust, a 53-minute documentary on the making and restoration of Murnaus film; test footage of Ernst Lubitschs abandoned production Marguerite and Faust; and a bonus DVD featuring the alternate 1930 cut of Faust with an original score by Timothy Brock, performed by the Olympia Chamber Orchestra.",1447891200,5,2261,5.15258855585831

If you want an epic score, more in line with the opera, and grandiose movie that is FAUST see the version with the music by William Axt (US). Mr. Axt, understands what this movie is about. And scores it accordingly. Mr. Axt is, in my opinion, ahead of his time and is an orchestral genius. He knows to use low-flat notes with an Obo for Mephistopheles and horns for the riders.

1417812,5,B00005ASOS,"I just watched the F. W. Murnau silent film version of Faust from 1926 and it was surprisingly good.  It's from the director of Nosferatu and heavily based on the Goethe version of the Faust legend, not the Christopher Marlowe verison.

Marlowe's Faust ends in a bleak and very hopeless kind of way whereas Goethe has Faust redeemed at the end with the idea that caring about others and love is the most powerful and most transcendent force in the universe and that, as it is the ultimate goodness, you cannot be damned if you can love.

This silent film is heavily based on the more hopeful version of the story by Goethe, containing elements of both part 1 and part 2 of Goethe's Faust.  I strongly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of Goethe's version of Faust.  I sort of wish it would get a remake, still set in the fifeenth / sixteenth century and with the same ending (even if people do find the idea of love redeeming you to be saccharine).  I think we need stories like this.  And it is a shame the Goethe version of Faust isn't more well known in the English speaking world.

This two disc DVD contains my now favorite silent film. This is the only film version of Faust to cover both Part 1 and 2 of Goethe's Faust. It strays a bit but the bulk of the story, particularly most of the Faust / Gretchen storyline is in tact. Most people only adapt the Christopher Marlowe version of the Faust legend if they are even familiar with it at all, which is sad because Goethe's version is the only one where Faust gets redeemed at the end. Faust is the German legend loosely based on a real life alchemist and self-proclaimed sorcerer. From this legend we get the demon name Mephistopheles AKA Mephisto, who in the legend, was not Satan himself but actually a high ranking demon.

This adaptation is from the director of Nosferatu. Apparently he loved to refilm many scenes several times in several different ways so at one point there were thirty different versions of this film floating around, some with differing dialogue, some with scenes shot slightly different, some with scenes missing, some with scenes added. Film historians have found five. This DVD contains two of them. An American release, and the original German version restored as much as possible to it's original content. The German version is on disc 1 with an option for English subtitles. The American cut is on disc 2. One scene that was changed in some versions is there's a scene with a bear. Some versions it's a man in a bear costume. Some with a live bear and in one cut the bear obviously actually hurt one of the actors but they leave it in.

I have seen people complain that Mephisto is too comical and not dark enough but clearly these people are not that familiar with Goethe's version of Faust. Mephisto was flamboyant, comical, but yes, evil. And that's what you get here. I have also seen the complaint that they ""Tacked on"" Faust going to Heaven and even the love story because ""That's not in Marlowe's version."" This is NOT Marlowe's Faust. Most of this version is based on the Goethe version of the story.

One thing that they changed for this film is one thing that they probably should have left alone. in Goethe's Faust the deal was for the ultimate experience, the moment Faust would wish to never end. In this film that's not the bargain. But considering how easily bored and distracted Faust gets at times I think it would have made certain parts better if that had been the deal.

In general though this is the only film version to truly tackle both parts of Goethe's Faust and they did it very well.",1381017600,15,3604,4.5107361963190185

In this movie Faust is an old scholar frustrated at his inability to help the local plague-stricken population. He summons Mephisto (the Devil) who offers a one day pact with no obligation. At the end of that day, at his request Faust has been restored to youth and helped to steal a lovely woman away from her groom and wedding feast.

What does it mean to sell your soul to the Devil?  Do we edven have souls?  Is the Devil real?  Do moral choices, if they actually exist, really impact our lives?  Are we here by chance or design?  Does life have meaning and purpose?

You will consider some of these timeless questions when you watch F. W. Murnau's 1926 film in a sharp, restored digital transfer that does justice to this special effects extravaganza of the supernatural.

Fresh from the triumphant success of Nosferatu, Murnau was given carte blanche to direct this epic fable of good and evil.  Adapted from the play by German lawyer and poet Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe (1749-1832) with samplings from English spy and play-write Christopher Marlowe (1564-1693), the screenplay by Hans Kyser provided Murnau with a multitude of opportunities to pull out all the stops that begin with Faust and Mephisto flying over a medieval town on the Devil's cape. (The remarkably detailed town was actually a 110 foot by 60 foot miniature set.) For the next two hours, a succession of vivid dream images -- set in darkness but always sliced by light -- make real the struggle of evil incarnate for the soul of one man -- and the destiny of all humanity.

German expressionism, dark mysticism, medieval folk saga and the highest level of cinematic arts then available make this an unforgettable experience.  Don't miss Faust's struggle for redemption after he makes a pact with the Devil in the form of Emil Janning's Mephisto.  This is a true classic of world cinema.",1278979200,,1561,4.827067669172933

I also have a feeling that M-G-M might have been influenced on THE WIZARD OF OZ ...
particularily in the ""flying monkeys"" sequences. And I'm sure that, given some more time think about it, other films that were influenced would come to mind.

1417832,3,B00005ASOS,"What can one say about a good movie? Quality is quite good, picture elements have been restored as best as they can be, which is not too bad.

My main gripe with this film (as I have with most other silent films on DVD) is that they are projected AT THE WQRONG SPEED! This speeded-up action really does take away from the quality of the film, as well as the seriousness of the drama. (This film was recorded at 20 frames per second [fps] but is shown at 24 fps, thereby lousing up the rhythm of this near-masterpiece!!)

There are two versions in this set: the American version, which runs 116 minutes, and the German version which runs only 106 minutes. The German version has subtitles in the intertitles, which can be bothersome to watch. (The quality of the German version is slightly less than the American version.)

The music for the American version is heroic indeed, performed by the Olympia Chamber Orchestra; the German version is performed -- I think -- very blandly by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. Music-wise, the American version's music is vastly superior!

So, all in all, I really can recommend this film, despite the shortdomings of too-fast projection. The acting is good, and the ""special effects"" work is nicely done, too. A worthy addition to any cinephile's library!",1240012800,11,1300,4.764444444444444

1417834,4,B00005ASOS,"Kino International has just released a Region 1 edition of the restored version of F. W. Murnau's FAUST as part of a new series of Murnau titles along with an upgraded and updated box set. This so called German version of the film has been available in Europe for quite some time but now it's come to the U.S. with only slight modifications. While it's cause for celebration, I had some problems with this release.

First the good news. The picture quality of the German version is first rate and shows you the flaws in the export version which looked pretty good up until this point. The print is not only cleaner but it's shorter by about 7 minutes which tightens everything up. The framing is better because it's the principal camera negative and it restores Faust's and Gretchen's ascension scene which is strangely missing from the export version.

Now the bad news. It's not really bad but it did have an impact on my viewing experience. While it's nice to have the original German intertitles for authenticity, it is sometimes difficult to the read the English subtitles against the old style German lettering. Yellow subtitles would have made it much easier. Second and even more important is the Mont Alto Orchestra's score that accompanies the film. While it is well played and well recorded as usual, it seems detached from what is happening onscreen. The Timothy Brock score for the export version is much more dramatic and is even cued to certain onscreen happenings. Too bad it couldn't have been rerecorded (to make up for the difference in running time) and used again.

These are only minor critical quibbles. Overall the film remains one of the pivotal examples of silent film storytelling and many thanks are due Kino for making it available to us along with the earlier export version so that we can compare. Also the Mont Alto score is more effective than the alternate piano score or the solo harp score that accompanied the Region 2 version.",1237852800,4,1964,4.770588235294118
1417835,5,B00005ASOS,"I think of Murnau's Faust as a masterpiece not only of cinema, but of the human imagination. I understand that reviews at the time of its premier were lukewarm, but I honestly can't imagine not feeling grateful for the opportunity to see this film today. Moments and images from it are so powerful, they are vivid in the mind years after seeing them -- two hours in a dream world.

The flying sequence has been commented-on more than once, and with good reason. It is a spectacular series of shots wherein the camera tracks through long miniature sets which gradually change from a dense cluster of medieval rooftops and steeples, to a tortuous countryside of mountain peaks and snake-like rivers, twisted trees, deep gorges with plunging waterfalls and stone cliffs, rapids, a field of long grass, elaborate renaissance architecture and an Italianate palace. Along the way there is an encounter with grotesque elongated black birds in the sky, their wings flapping in unison. The sets incorporate running water (with little bits of smoking material floating in the rapids to simulate splashes and spray), an illuminated moon, and smoke to simulate clouds and fog. The whole sequence can't be much more than a couple of minutes long, but the effort to design, construct and coordinate the sequence must have been staggering. The following palace scene is set on a huge multi-level set with female dancers stretching off into the distance. They are there for no better reason than to establish an atmosphere of sumptuous decadence, and young Faust arrives in the middle of this riding between two enormous elephants, which seem to be entirely artificial and crafted of fabric, wire, etc. So it goes throughout the production. Almost every scene is a feast for the eyes, and the darker scenes are vividly expressionistic in design.

The acting is the old-fashioned silent-movie variety of big operatic gestures and vivid facial expression. It may seem odd to those not used to it, but it is NOT an example of ham actors overdoing it. This was a legitimate style of acting in its time, and offers genuine artistic beauty to those who can manage to appreciate it.",1232064000,,2159,4.9449035812672175
1417836,5,B00005ASOS,"Well, yes, we're generally annoyed by reviewers who comment on a release before it's released; but I have this twofer in a British DVD under the Masters of Cinema series, containing both the original German version, and the re-editted US version, and wanted to tell potential purchasers that the German version, alone, is worth the price of admission.

The German version is shorter than the US, which was padded substantially. I'm not sure what the US people had in mind when they padded the film, but the more tightly editted German edition is just wonderful. I watched them both at the same sitting, and the US version seemed to drag a bit, while the German version moved along at a much more brisk and interesting pace. The German version seemed to fix my attention during the entire film moreso than the looser US version.

Also, the films are framed just a bit differently, as two cameras were used to film this -- one right next to the other -- which caused the two films to be framed from just slightly different angles. Not significantly, but enough to make the German version visually more appealing. The British DVD had an 'extra' which showed a split-screen comparison of certain significant scenes from the film(s), and the difference between them was amazing, both in the scenes' composition and length. I don't known whether this Kino set will contain a comparable extra.

If you already have this film in it's US version, you'll enjoy seeing the long-lost German cut. This one is Murnau's 'original' vision of this film. If you haven't seen the film yet, and enjoy silent films, I highly recommend watching this one.",1229558400,8,1632,4.800711743772242

1417848,5,B00005ASOS,"What would you sell your soul for?

This is the question posed by the Faust tale, told by Marlowe, by Goethe and here by the incomparable F W Murnau.

As usual, Murnau is a master of creating mood and so the scenes with Mephisto are dark and forboding.  The scenes with old Faust are tinted as if with age and the scenes of young Faust almost burst off the scene with their electric energy.

A master of the moment, Murnau uses a rush of pictures to tell his story.  The dark Mephisto, all hawk winged poses over of the people.  The weary old Faust cringes in terror as he helplessly uses the finger of his healing to dam off the incringing plague.  The resigned Faust agrees with Mephisto a one day trial to heal certainly all instead of maybe a few.  The young Faust beams radiantly in the glow of love.  The distraught Faust sacrifices all to save his love.

And finally ""liebe"" love itself litterally beats the devil.

Owing to its gravity and potential for being sacarine, the Faust tale requires a true master for its telling and this movie shows just how well F W Murnau is suited to the task...so suited in fact that he deserves to be watched along with those who've read Marlowe and Goethe.",1222214400,,1199,4.404545454545454

1417850,5,B00005ASOS,"Cinematic brilliance in scope, production design, and execution define F.W. Murnau's ""Faust.""  The film is a must see by all especially those who appreciate cinema as an art form.  Murnau's legacy resides in company with the most visual filmmakers.  He wastes little cinematic time with generic images of actors heads, and instead focuses on conveying his ideas through the moving image.

The film draws the viewer in with opening shot of skeleton death riders moving through smoke and wind on their demon horses.  The images are both surreal and tactile allowing the viewer to access them as a dream and as reality.  This balance of fantasy and tangibility is rarely seen in contemporary films due to the reliance on computer generated images.

The stylized low key lighting adds great contrast.  The light and dark does much to emphasize the divinity of heaven and the cursed prince of darkness.  Faust himself is heavily back-lit with a halo rimmed around his disheveled hair.  This halo signifies his and man's connection to God and gives the viewer hope in Faust's eventual redemption.

An image that catches one's attention is the image of the prince of darkness gleaming over a bed that contains the young Faust and a princess. Faust has given himself over to the lust of youth.  Here the devil gleans over a canopy bed and triumphantly closes the curtain on Faust and the princess.

The film is not without flaws.  The strong visuals slow up in the middle and the brilliance of the first forty minutes molds into a theatrical display of humor and plot as the devil flirts with Gretchen's Aunt Marthe.  The reading of these events seem better suited for the theater and less suited for cinema.

Despite this setback, ""Faust"" should be regarded as one of the best films ever committed to the screen in both philosophical text and pure cinematic strength.

Perhaps, a better restoration of the film could reawaken audiences' interest, as it did with ""Metropolis.""",1218240000,,1968,4.915151515151515
1417851,5,B00005ASOS,"Familiarity with neither Marlowe's ""Tragedy of Doctor Faustus"" nor Goethe's ""Faust"" will prepare you for this Murnau masterpiece.  It is a film that truly surprises, clearly echoing its protagonist's own journey from greatness to aimless indecision, unintended disaster, and finally a strong resolution.  This insanely brilliant yet highly uneven work is a clear and beautiful transition from the fantastic expressionistic horror of Murnau's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nosferatu/dp/B000VUQ4HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nosferatu</a>"" to the dark and stunningly beautiful tragic romance of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunrise/dp/B0002DCHQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunrise</a>.""  It is almost schizophrenic in its scope, but it pays off masterfully in the end.

""Faust"" begins as a stylized satanic horror film, rife with the most absolutely jaw-dropping special effects that would not be outdone for decades to come.  At the heart of this first act is (unsurprisingly) Faust, a spiritual, saintly man who is forced to play Job to a quarreling Angel and Devil.  Unfortunately, Faust has his breaking point and descends, brilliantly, into the world of the damned.  For the first hour of the film, we are subjected to cinematic wonder after cinematic wonder as Murnau and crew constantly manage to top each and every visual that they throw at you.  Even when Faust signs away his soul and seems to lose all of his dramatic potential, the visuals keep you glued to your seat.

About an hour into the film, though, the film takes an abrupt turn.  Just as Faust becomes bored and indecisive with his newfound powers, Murnau seems to become bored and indecisive with the direction of his powerful film.  It descends into a black comedy which, although humorous at points, feels highly tedious and out of place.  Fortunately, as this chapter wraps up after approximately 30 minutes, it's purpose becomes clear.

The film then transitions into a gritty tragedy about Gretchen, Faust's love interest introduced in the previous act.  Like the previous one, this dark and depressing act seems to come out of nowhere, not even featuring Faust and seemingly having little to do with the story begun in the first act.

However, just as Gretchen's fortunes take an even greater turn for the worse, the film makes a stunning transition, leaping to life with brilliant action, drama, effects, camera work, and acting.  For the rest of my life, I doubt that I will ever forget Gretchen's primal cry for Faust, visually transcending distance and the boundaries of Hell itself.  The film ends soon after, but not before delivering gorgeous, dramatically saturated moment after moment.  The end leaves you with a feeling of elated sorrow -- something I never would have expected from what began as an expressionist horror film.

In the end, Faust is a wonderfully cruel love tragedy, soaring with emotion even higher than it ever soared with the best cinematic imagery of its day.  ""Faust"" is a must see for anyone that shares an equal love for satanic horror and divine tragedy.  You'll get both in equal measure, here.

Regarding the transfer itself, Kino does an adequate job, but there's certainly room for improvement.  The transfer has its share of jumps, scratches, imperfections, and minor over-all graininess, all while suffering from seemingly poor contrast.  It's absolutely watchable, but I'd love to see the Murnau Foundation take this film to the next level, making it shine in the way that it deserves to.  I do have to say that the score on Kino's release is incredible, though, absolutely complimenting and nurturing every aspect of Murnau's masterpiece with a Wagner-inspired energy.  I'd hate to watch this film without it.

**Note: This review pertains to the 2001 Kino release.  Kino has since released a newly remastered edition with a different score.",1217980800,9,3942,5.439144736842105
1417852,5,B00005ASOS,"This is a 1926 classic of silent cinema. This new life that has been given to the film comes from the fact that the domestic (German) version has been restored and we can compare it with the export version that had survived. It is absolutely striking how the domestic version is tighter in the shooting, the taking and the cutting. The angle is slightly different and better, the contrast is a lot finer and more pronounced, which is very important for a black and white film. The cutting packs up many sequences and this increases the dramatic dimension and effect of the film. Apart from that you will not recognize any running version of the myth.

The film is essentially centered on the love affair with Gretchen, but a long first part concentrates on the fight between God and Satan to conquer the world. Faust is nothing but a wager thrown by God at Satan's face. This prologue in the sky and this mystic dimension is partly, but only partly, borrowed from Goethe's Second part of his play. But that is all. This first part of the film also makes Faust travel in time but we are very far from the farce Marlowe set up in this voyage to various courts, including those of Troy's Helen, the Germanic Emperor and the Pope in Rome. It is shorter and more centered on the Emperor, on Germany.

Most of the second part of Goethe's play is totally absent since this second part is entirely centered on Faust's voyage in time first, to the past, and then in time as well as in space towards some future, this time building dams in Holland. The film then centers on the affair and on the manipulation of everyone by Mephistopheles. He cheats all the time. He asserts his desire to protect Faust but he is the one who goes and tells Valentin, the brother, and then spread the news of Valentin's murder in the city, a murder he has done himself. But so far so good. We can live with this lying Mephistopheles.

But then the film becomes melodramatic in an extreme proportion. Gtechen is only put in the blocks for her fornication and then abandoned in the street with her baby in the winter and that is a major difference with all other versions. The baby finally dies of cold. She is discovered with the dead baby and at once accused of having killed him and brought to the stake where she is burnt in spite of Faust's intermission. She accepts her fate since her baby is dead. But the ending is not without some resemblance with Gounod's Faust. In Gounod she kills her baby out of cold blood, and she is saved by the intervention of Jesus Christ himself.

A deus ex machina to save her. Artificial and in Gounod practically farcical. Here it is more serious, very visual but Faust regains his youth again on the pyre and they kiss in the flames and both are saved together at this very moment by the intervention of some angel brandishing the fire of God. This is a moment when the film winks at Goethe who also saved Faust but after a long second part and for quite different reasons. The film finally concludes with a moral about one human dimension that will never be conquered by Satan, and this is LOVE. Here we find again both Berlioz and Gounod for whom love is the explanation of everything and love is also the excuse of everything.

Then this very melodramatic action leaves us slightly lost in front of the film because the general atmosphere and impression we get here is that of horror, with the plague at the beginning and a pyre at the end, and several people being killed along the way. What made the Germans visit over and over again in these late 20s that theme of horror, either old and great myths like Nosferatu and Faust, or dystopias like Metropolis? Some leaning coming from history and everyday life after the defeat of 1918 and before the victory of 1933? These fifteen years are the melting pot of all frustrations and dis-satisfactions, dis-contentment.

But in this film shot before Murnau's moving to Hollywood we have a darker atmosphere than in Nosferatu, though less intensely tragic, or even Metropolis, though without any human or social hope at all, and the special effects are better used to create the scenes in heaven for example.

1417853,5,B00005ASOS,"This movie has perked my interest in the silent film era.  Murnau's use of light and shade, human expression, and dreamlike (or nightmarish) landscapes create an artistic feast for the mind.  Each scene is a punctuation mark.  Probably one of the greatest artistic achievments put on film.  The accompanying film score is also well suited to the content.",1187827200,,354,5.051724137931035
1417854,5,B00005ASOS,"I bought this without having previously viewed it, because so much has been written about the visuals and atmosphere.  I'm no film expert, but I can tell that this film is something very special.  Its like David Lynch only good.  Murnau basically keeps a theme while being an expressionist; something modern ""art"" film makers can't seem to do.  Murnau has done the impossible:  told a full length story with a beginning and end using only images and feelings.  You feel every one in your bones and if you're like me, you'll appreciate every frame of the movie.  There seems to be not one shot in the whole movie that doesn't have meaning on its own.

All this being said, what is the film about?  I was not previously familiar with Faust except for knowing he was the ""guy who made a deal with the Devil"" thing.  Devil makes deal with archangel (stunning depictions by the way), Devil in part of deal tries to corrupt long-bearded Faust.  Faust is a pompous academic whose piety and devotion to God you always doubt from the beginning (probably from his alchemist background).  The Devil easily entices Faust to make a 24 hour pact in which time he successfully introduces Faust to all the things he normally reserves for those who either have good looks, youth, riches or all three and Faust; about to partake of a beautiful woman for (what we assume) his first time, is forced to either lose his newly found youth or make the pact eternal in the face of end of the 24 hour pact immediately impending.  The rest is a spoiler so I won't ruin it except to say that there is much joy and sorrow the rest of the way.

The acting by Faust and the Devil is first rate.  The rest of the acting is good.  Gretchen is fun to watch, especially when she shuffles around her house.  The movie itself lives on its own.  The ending seems abrupt upon first watching, but upon subsequent watchings it seems to make far more sense.

Favorite moment:  I have two, when Mephisto makes a scary face at Gretchen when she is going to church, and when the archangel raises his flaming sword in judgement against the Devil.

Greatest wonderful surprise:  The orchestral score that plays with the movie is fantastic.  Better than any I've ever heard with a silent.

Extras:  Not many.  Just some production photos and a hard copy of an essay written about the movie by some guy.

Movie rating:  9 out of 10.  Some may say the middle part drags a little, but I think that was intentional in order to bring out some thematic ideas.",1172620800,6,2505,4.504444444444444
1417855,5,B00005ASOS,"Faust is just an incredible accomplishment in the art of silent cinema, one of the most ambitious and masterfully directed films of any era.  If you've never seen a silent film and wonder if one could even keep your attention, Faust is the film to watch.  Far too many classic early films were either lost or came to us in relatively poor condition, but this digitally mastered version of Faust is remarkably clear and free of white outs.  I'm sure it looks better now that it did when it was released over eight decades ago.  Don't go thinking we're only talking about characters standing around conversing, either; F. W. Murnau packed all kinds of incredible special effects into this magnificent piece of filmmaking.

You all know Faust - that fellow who made a deal with the devil.  The story goes back as far as the fifteenth century, with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe penning the definitive version in the early nineteenth century.  Murnau's Faust differs somewhat from the original two-part drama written by Goethe, supplanting rationalism with mysticism (no one did mysticism better than early German filmmakers).  This approach, among other things, allows Murnau to open the film with nothing less than jaw-dropping visuals and effects.  The story is heralded by the grim image of the apocalyptic horsemen thundering through the clouds, leading us to a confrontation between Mephisto (Satan) and an archangel over the control of the Earth.  A wager is proposed, with dominion over the Earth set to depend upon the fate of one man's soul.  That man is, of course, Faust, a good man targeted for evil temptation by the cursed one.  Knowing he could not tempt Faust directly, Mephisto uses his own compassion against him.  As a devastating plague is unleashed among Faust's fellow citizens, Mephisto casts his dark shadow over the landscape quite literally, as we see him hovering over the entire village.  That, to me, is one of the most memorable and iconographic cinematic sights I've ever seen.

As his friends and neighbors beg Faust (Gosta Ekman) to save them from the plague, his unanswered prayers bring him to the point of despair.  He actually summons Mephisto himself (in another incredible special effects-laden scene).  After some deliberation, Mephisto (Emil Jannings) convinces Faust to sign a pact for one day only, and that proves to be an offer Faust can't refuse.  A little later, though, Mephisto brings in the big guns - the promise of restored youth.  Extending the contract from one day to eternity is basically just a formality at this point.  All of his new powers don't truly satisfy Faust, though, and so he sets his sights on a lovely, pure maiden by the name of Gretchen (Camilla Horn).  The whole mood of the film changes at this point, with the art of wooing temporarily displacing the clouds of doom hanging over the first half of the film - but this is only a prelude to true tragedy.  As Daniel Johnston says, ""Don't play cards with Satan, he'll deal you an awful hand,"" and that is exactly what happens here.  It gets pretty darned depressing, really, making it hard for the viewer to see how Faust can possibly redeem himself for all of the misery he has caused.  Murnau doesn't pull any punches when it comes to establishing the central theme of the story.

Thanks to earlier successes such as Nosferatu and The Last Laugh, Murnau had complete control over the making of Faust.  Something of a perfectionist, Murnau made sure that every aspect of every single shot met with his satisfaction.  It's obvious that the man was a genius, as even the contrast of light and shadow reinforces the central motif of the story he is telling.  The special effects seem years and years ahead of their time.  Even the makeup is remarkably well-done (I would never have guessed that Gosta Ekman played both the old and young versions of Faust, as the older version looks genuinely old).  And the acting?  Top-notch, all the way.  Ekman is superb, Emil Jannings becomes the very personification of Mephisto, and an inexperienced Camilla Horn is simply enchanting as Gretchen.  (The role of Gretchen was actually written for Lillian Gish, but she bowed out because Murnau refused her demand to have her own personal cameraman shoot the film.)  The musical score, composed and conducted by Timothy Brock, is a wonderful counterpart to the film, as well.

In virtually every way possible, F.W. Murnau's Faust is nothing less than a cinematic masterpiece.",1170028800,34,4476,4.891246684350133
1417856,5,B00005ASOS,"... the performance of the musical score is dreadful! The actuall composition is ok, but listen to the unbarable sound of the strings! Ghastly! Can't anybody tell Kino (and Eureka) to find an orchestra that know how to tune their instruments and keep the tone while playing them?

The music actually destroyed the whole experience for me. Spectacular film otherwise, but I think Murnau is turning in his grave knowing a bunch of amateurs making sound to his pictures.

The five stars are all for Murnau!

7935659,5,B00005ASOS,"The Devil (called Mephisto here) inflicts Famine, Pestilence, and War on the earth. God's archangel comes to upbraid him, saying the earth is a beautiful place, most especially for the people who have the free will and do good. Mephisto says that men are easily corrupted and claims he can corrupt the good man Faust. Mephisto says Faust is already greedy, trying to change base metal into gold. They make a bargain--if Mephisto can corrupt Faust, he can have the world.

Faust is an elderly scientist in the medieval mode, open to alchemy as much as chemistry. He works hard for a cure to the plague that is ravaging his home town. He also prays to God that the cure he's invented will be efficacious. Faust gives his concoction to a woman who dies almost immediately. He despairs. He starts burning his books, even a bible. One book is clearly an occult book, since it has a way to summon Mephisto to do one's bidding. It blows open on the fire. Faust sees the spell, tries it out, but immediately regrets it. Faust runs away from the lightening and fireballs that herald Mephisto's arrival. Mephisto is not one to be put off and eventually enters a pact with Faust. Mephisto will be his servant if Faust signs over his soul. Faust agrees, letting Mephisto come up with a cure for the plague. When one plague victim clings to a crucifix, Faust can't approach her, leading the locals to stone him. Mephisto whisks him away, turns him young, and sets him on a life of debauchery. Can true love with hometown girl Gretchen save Faust's soul?

Director Murnau (most famous for Nosferatu, his unauthorized adaptation of Dracula) is in top form with amazing special effects and great performances, especially from Emil Jannings as Mephisto. He's both creepy and comical, morphing to match whoever he's playing against. He's a classical demon (horns and wings) when debating the archangel, a wizen old man when dealing with old man Faust, and a young rake gallivanting around with the youthened Faust. His adeptness at corrupting Faust and others is horrifying and fascinating. The effects are a convincing blend of miniatures, camera tricks, and lighting. For a 1920s silent film, it's astounding.

Highly recommended.",1511568000,2,2214,4.851851851851852
7935660,5,B00005ASOS,"The story is Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe's; the film is unmistakably F.W. Murnau.

The Archangel (Werner Fuetterer) and the evil one are in a struggle for the world. Both are sure they know best. A bet is stuck for the sole of a religious alchemist named Faust as we can see he has knowledge of the elements yet maintains a moral attitude.

A grate plague appears and with all of his books and learning Foust can not save anyone. He turns to prayer and seems to get nowhere. So in a fit he burns his books; in the embers he spots a book that suggests he call on Mephisto (Emil Jannings.) He does so and is repelled at what he did. However after some dickering he accepts a one day contract to at least be able to help some of the plague victims. Naturally he is to reject God and sign in blood. And you guessed it things go wrong. He is tempted by youth, ""Your Life was only the dust and mold of books."", and distracted with an Italian cutie Duchess of Parma (Hanna Ralph) just long enough for the sands to run out on him. From there things go down hill but the story heats up.

With the overwhelming visuals and great acting one tends to not notice the elements or threads that tie this film today to our society. Notice the standard circle and the calling upon the four corners as Faust calls three times the name Mephisto. Also notice the garlands that Gretchen made for the children. More interesting is the use of the flower with ""She loves me...she loves me not.""

Emil Jannings does such a good job that you almost find your self rooting for the bad guy.",1505865600,2,1560,4.295918367346939
