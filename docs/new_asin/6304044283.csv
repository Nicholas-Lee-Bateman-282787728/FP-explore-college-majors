7860697,5,6304044283,Interesting anime! It is like a comedy/Serious anime! Fun for the kids but pretty good for the older audiences as well!!,1477008000,,120,4.761904761904762
7860698,3,6304044283,"Now ordinarily,reviewing the slayers would mean an instant 5 stars,but this is dubbed and the voices are terrible. For God's sake people hell for my sake even if your gonna watch this series watch them subtitled.",979603200,2,212,4.916666666666667
7860699,5,6304044283,Most anime is about going around killing monsters and having magical powers and stuff.  What seperates The Slayers from other anime?  It's freakin' funny!  I especially love hearing the slow minded Gourry talk  about Lina's flat chest.  This is a funny video that you shouldn't pass up.,962236800,,286,5.0
7860700,4,6304044283,"This video sets up the Copy Rezo story arc. We are introduced to Amelia(the justice worshipping sorceress-in training), her dad Prince Phillionel, Gourry's rival Zangulus, and Vrumagunn, a grim sorcerer with a  jewel on his head. This video isn't the best, nor is it the worst. Amelia  is sure to give you a good laugh when flips and falls on her face. The  second episode on this tape is the best one. Amelia thinks of Lina as a  role model of justice and the scenes where Lina gets posessed by  ghosts(perverted ghosts I may add)are funny too. This is a pretty worthy  tape to add to your Slayers collection.",961632000,,610,4.5504587155963305
7860701,5,6304044283,"After finding out that Gourry has the Sword of Light,and Radous and Zolf start being on Lina's side,her life could not be better. Or could it get worse? Rezo the Red Priest finally manages to get the Oralcion Statue from  Lina, the dark lord is finally relased. But after the dark lord took out  some people Lina is shocked. Now her life can't be any worse, but it does,  some people die. And Lina won't battle anymore! Will they be able to  convince Lina to battle? Get The Slayers 3!",952128000,,485,4.355555555555555
7860702,5,6304044283,"A very emotional volume of the Slayers.  It actually tries to be serious, but then Prince Phil comes bursting in right when Gourry is about to take on Rezo.  It's so funny!  These are some great episodes, and they also  leave you wanting to see the Slayers Next.",950572800,,262,4.395833333333333
7860703,5,6304044283,"Before Slayers, the only anime I'd seen was Pokemon - so I didn't have a very high opinion of japanese animation. One of my friends, however, talked about Slayers constantly, so when she brought the video over, I agreed to  watch it. At first I wasn't very impressed, the drawing seemed crude. Then  Rezo's mind control spell took effect on me, and I found myself falling in  love with the show. The characters are all hilarious and sympathetic -  you've got to love Lina and Zel!",942537600,,480,4.546511627906977
