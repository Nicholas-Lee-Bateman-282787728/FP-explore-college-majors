The main female role of the character Larisa is played by Larisa Guzeyeva, and this film was her debut in cinema. Nikita Mikhalkov, famous director and actor, plays Paratov. It is based on events in 1877-1878, although the film was not made until 1984. The main setting for the film is on the bank of the Volga River in a small fictional town. This movie is classified as a drama romance.
 The movie begins in the town of Bryakhimov. The first scene is a wedding, where we see Kharita, Larisas mom, giving her other daughter Olgas hand in marriage to a prince. Olga does not look very happy at her own wedding, which makes the viewers question what is going on. We later find out her husband has been caught cheating on her and she needs help financially, but Kharita is already trying to find a suitor for her other daughter Larisa. Kharita decides to invite all the bachelors in the town to celebrate Larisas birthday, and a new character enters the film: a man named Paratov. His attraction to Larisa as well as the reciprocation is obvious, and he is also wealthy and witty. A man named Karandyshev is also there, vying for Larisas attention, but she is more interested in Paratov. Paratov then goes to Larisas house and invites her to spend the night with him; he wants to show her The Swallow, his boat. He is struggling financially and selling the boat, so that night was the last time it would really belong to him. After the night he spends with Larisa, he goes home to sort out his financial woes and asks his friend Karandyshev to tell Larisa he is going on a business trip. Karandyshev is in love with Larisa, so this does not go as Paratov would have hoped. She rushes to the train station to see him off, but she misses her chance and is not fast enough. Kharita has another get together for potential suitors of Larisa, and one man gets arrested, causing a scene and ruining the familys reputation. Larisa ends up telling her mother she will marry the next man that proposes to her because she is tired of looking for the right one, and Karandyshev is the first to do so. This part of the movie ends with Paratov coming back to town. The second part of the film is mainly wedding preparation as well as the wedding. Karandyshev hosts a dinner party, and Paratov is there along with some other men we saw at Olgas wedding. Larisa does not want to publicize their wedding plans yet, because she doesnt actually love him. The men plan to take Larisa and Paratov on The Swallow one last time before it is owned by someone else, and Larisa finds out that Paratov cannot be with her. She decides to marry someone else, either Knuro or Vozhevavto. Knuro offers her a trip to France, and she considers it. This entire time, Karandyshev has been listening and planning his retaliation. He confronts Larisa and basically attempts to claim ownership of her, but she replies saying if she doesnt love someone but is forced to marry them, she will choose the person with the most money. Karandyshev has some decisions to make about what he will do next: go after Larisa, go after the men, or let it be.
 I really liked the writing and the plot this movie followed. It was a little predictable at times but it was easy to follow, and I need that because I am in no way fluent in Russian and would not have understood if the plot and characters were all over the place. I know the film wasn't written in 1984 and it wasn't an original storyline, but I applaud the way it was directed as well. It reminded me a little bit of an American soap opera, with a girl and many men vying for her attention. As American dramas go, the girl is in love with a man she cannot have, which causes emotions and pain for everyone involved.
 I also enjoyed the costume design and the attention to detail. Nothing the characters were wearing seemed out of place for the time period, which means Ryazanov paid close attention to when these events had taken place. Larisas outfits embodied the woman of the late 19th century, because she wore a dress and hairstyle that looks common for the 1800s. The men in the film also fit the time period, wearing suits, top hats, ties, and chains. All the men wore outfits similar to the vague one I described, which shows the effort put into costume design.
 Overall, I enjoyed this film. Although it was predictable and probably not something I would watch again, I liked it while I was watching it and it held my attention throughout the whole film. It was very dramatic, and I live for drama. I would give this film a five out of ten because the main points I look for in a film are: interesting, good enough to be watched again, and something I would tell my friends about. This movie was a little bit interesting, but I would not waste my time watching it again, nor would I tell my friends about it because it was too drawn out and predictable. If you are into romantic dramas, this is the movie for you, but if that isn't your favorite genre, you don't have to waste your time watching it.",1489017600,,5086,4.4363636363636365

A Cruel Romance takes place in the town of Bryakhimov in 1877-1878. The first episode shows events that had happen throughout the year. In this episode, we first see that Kharita is marrying off her daughter, Olga to a Caucasian prince. During the wedding, you could tell Olga was an unhappy bride who was about to sail off with her husband.

The greatest way to help both daughters was for Kharita to invite all the eligible bachelors in the area over to celebrate Larissas birthday. Here is where we actually get to see Paratov, a rich and charming man. I could tell for the first moment we saw Paratov at the wedding to the party; Larisa had some sort of attraction to him. Also at this party, we meet Knuro who is a rich marry man who helps out Ogualova family with money issues as well as Vozhevatvo a long friend to Larissa who thinks of them like a brother. Throughout the party, men basically threw themselves at her. For example Karandyshev, one could tell that he was in love with Larissa. He would do anything that he could to get her to notice him but he could shine over Paratovs personality. We also get to see that Larissa has a wonderful voice that all of the men swoon over. The next event that accords is when Paratov goes to Larissas house and asks her to spend the evening with her on his boat named the Swallow. During this time, Larissa gets to see how the boats runs and how fast it can really go. Paratov knew that Larisa had a thing for his boat and that is why he asked her to come on it because it was the last time that the boat would be his. After their romantic day, Partov left to go back to his homeland to save his familys estate. He told Larissas friend, Karandyshev (the postman who is madly in love with her) to tell Larissa that he is leaving on a business trip.

After this accords we see Larissa and her mother at the crematory and Larissa telling her mother that she will marry the first man who proposed to her, which ended up being Karandyshev.  This episode ends with us seeing Partov coming back to the town.

The main event that is see in the episode is Karandyshev hosting a dinner party at his house in the honor of his love Larissa. Larissa flat out tells him she doesnt want this to go public that they are getting married at this party. She tells Karandyshev that she isn't ashamed of him yet but later we find out she is because of how jealous he gets. During this dinner party, we can tell that Karandyshev doesnt know how throw a party for people with a higher status then him. He ends up getting drunk off a cheap alcohol in front of his guest: Partov, Vozhevatvo, Knuro, Robinson, Kharita and Larissa. Throughout the party, you can tell that you can tell that everyone isn't happy with Karandyshev and not happy with him getting married with Larissa. The men at the party plan to take Larissa on a big party on the Swallow a last hurrah for Partov before the new owner get the boat to himself. Larissa agrees to go with them and runs off with them and once Karandyshev finds out he takes off the pistol from his wall and runs after Larissa. The men and Larissa have a great time eating and drinking we get to hear Larissas voice one more time as well as Partov. The last encounter of Larissa and Partov is a sad moment this is the moment Larissa finds out that Partov cannot be with her. After this, we see Knuro and Vozhevatvo establish who should go after Larissa and Knuro wins the game. Then Knuro gives her the choice to go to France. During this whole thing, we see Karandyshev hiding and hearing all this information he has always had is revenge planned on these men who has belittling him and treated Larissa and a prize. He finds Larissa and confronts her about it. Karandyshev explain why she should be with him and how he is hers. She disagrees and tell him if she is going to be with someone who she cant love she will go for the money then she races out of the room.  What will Karandyshev do? Will he confront and kill the men who have hurt him and made Larissa feel that she is just a prize? Or will he kill the woman of his dream so no one can have her?
One of the aspect of the filmmaking that amazed me was the costume for this time period. Since this movie took place in 1877-1878, Ryazanov had to make sure that the outfit of the actors fit within this time. I feel that he did an amazing job with this. I could tell that he researched the clothing for this time period. For the womens fashion, he had the tight dress with a long train in the back with pleated ruffles, bows, lace buttons and hats with a ribbon streamers. The dresses also had a square cut in the front of the dress. Example, would be the blue dress that Larissa is seen in throughout most of the movie, she also wore her hair up in a tight knot with fringe bangs which was a common hairstyle during this time.  As for the men, the common fashion of 1878 which is a coat with a contrasting collar with a waistcoat that had a watch chain, wide ascot tie, square-toed shoes and a top hat. Most of the men in the movie wore this describe of this outfit. An example would be the scene where Vozhevatvo and Larissa are talking outside the dress shop. He is wearing a grayish blue suit with an overcoat. Underneath the overcoat, we can see the waist coat with the chain of the watch as well as the tie with the contrasting collar. Also, he is wearing a top hat as well as square-toed shoes.
Another accept of filmmaking that is seen in this movie is acting mainly by the actors facial expressions. Throughout this movie, I am able to understand the emotion of each actor without having to read the subtitles. I could see the attraction that Larissa and Partvo have this being the way they look at each other with desire in their eyes and the small interaction they have. An example when Partvo was sly and found a way to hold Larissa hand while blowing the horn of the boat. Another example, is when Larissa and Partvo I could tell that they were upser with the how they could be together this by the facial expression by Larissa she looked sad and was ready to cry; Partvo broke his cigar into piece when he explains why he couldn't be with her and you could tell he was upset by how before he left the room his eyes were watery and he look stressed out when he rub his hands through his hair. These small details in their acting helped me understand that they had feelings for each other from the beginning of the movie without being fluent in Russian.
Being someone who only knows a little bit of Russian, I thought the soundtrack to the movie was really well. Even though I have no clue what they were singing, by the title of the song and the way the actors sang the song I was able to understand the purpose and the emotion of the song. I also enjoy how the music changed between the first and second episodes once the gypsies where added in at the end I enjoy the up-lifting moments that they supplied.

My overall reaction to this movie is that it is predictable. I could tell that certain things would happen in the movie that I will not spoil for the views. I think with the amount of foreshadowing that in this movie it explains itself. The title is a big give away a CRUEL romance. The word cruel alone state that love isn't easy and someone is going to suffer in this case it was more than one person. Each person who love Larissa knew that they wouldnt have her heart because she was in love with someone who she couldn't even have. I thought that the actors and actresses did well in their roles that were giving to them. You could tell they understood what was needed to let the audience know how their character was feeling and what struggles they were going through in this movie. I understand why Nikita Mikhalkov won all those awards for his acting because of how he execution of his roles.
I did enjoy this movie to a certain point, I felt that it was too long it was over 2 hours a lot of the stuff was dragged out too long but I did like the build-up for episode one to two. I enjoy how the actors in the movie presented their roles and I felt that I could content with them. Plus, I like how the gypsy and Robinson where add to relieve some of the tension in the movie.  If I had to rate this from a scale from 1 to 10 I would give it a solid 6.5 mainly because of the plot being so predictable also some lighting issues but the acting save it for me. I felt that Eldar Ryazanov had a very strong cast who knew what they needed to do in order to make this movie a hit. I understand why this movie won the awards it did.",1488412800,,10014,4.293495505023797
