When I saw that this was available on Amazon I was so happy.  The quality is quite a bit better, but still could be greatly improved.  But I am just so happy to have it again!",1395446400,,351,4.1940298507462686

8072147,5,B000A1GZAS,It's a slow video but my four year old hung in there and enjoyed it.  The music is wonderful and Meryl Streep does a great job.  The artwork is really great too.  It's a classic.,1232236800,,178,4.0285714285714285
8072148,5,B000A1GZAS,"Excellent Christmas video, not to short, not to long, will keep the young ones interest.  Beautifully illustrated, nice mix of familiar musical themes with George Winston's interpretation.  Meryl Streep's narration.....nicely done. Watch it with the family or play it as background, as we do. Most of all, Enjoy!",976406400,2,312,5.479166666666667
