1706904,4,B0000648XM,"Like many fans of this genre, I grew up watching Ultraman on television, along with his human alter ego Hyata (sp?) and his cohorts in the Science Patrol.  Watched in amazement as, every episode, a new gigantic monster arrives out of nowhere to destroy the city.  Logic and rationality notwithstanding, I have a long abiding love for all things Ultraman, and this film is no exception.  The uninitiated should be warned:  there's no Science Patrol here.
My understanding is that in Japan, every season brought a new Ultraman with a new human counterpart -- the Ultraman we knew in the USA was 1966's Ultraman Jack (I think) in Japan, just one of many.  Hyata or not, this film will satisfy your jones for Ultraman.
The story is not too hard to follow, and there is no shortage of action.  The effects, while not exactly Industrial Light & Magic, are definitely an improvement on those I was used to.  The main plot focuses on a bunch of kids and their use and abuse of a fantasy-fulfilling red ball, and as usual this kind of story can get tiresome, but the climactic battle -- on land, sea, and in the air -- with Ultramans Dyna and Tiga coming to the aid of Gaia, is quite the treat.  It was especially interesting comparing the English-dubbed version's dialogue and story to the English-subtitled version.  I highly recommend it.",1047081600,5,1332,4.6581196581196584
1706905,4,B0000648XM,I grew up watching Ultraman and have always enjoyed the television show. I knew to expect goofy monsters with model buildings that go crunch. I got what I expected and thoroughly enjoyed it. My son loved it so here begins the next generations of fans.,1023235200,4,251,4.6

7960637,5,B0000648XM,"I found this movie for $10 so I had to pick it up. I used to own this on VHS back when I was in Elementary school and I loved every minute of it. It's a great Ultraman title for old and young, great fun to watch and overall a must have in your movie collection.

Personal Story:

I used to watch the original Ultraman with my dad when I was growing up, along with ""Ultraman: Towards The Future"". So many years later (when I got to 3rd grade) we found this movie at the mall and it was purchased for me by my parents. I loved it so much and watched it for many years, but when I went to relive it again (then in High school) the tape was so worn that it became tangled in the VCR.

Now here I am as a young man in college watching it again and plan to keep this copy for as long as it works.

Actual Review:

The movie is pleasing to the eye, replacing old school special effects techniques with more digital and up-to-date effects that are very well executed in this film. It still has the charm of the original Ultraman from 60's but has the special effects that today's generation of Ultra-fans would like to see. So there is a good medium for fans old and new alike.

The plot itself is also enjoyable, I won't spoil anything but it's a nice slice of life meeting with the imagination of a child while still keeping it serious sci-fi feel. There is loads of action and it's just an overall great time, I recommend this film even if you aren't an Ultraman fan, it's still a good time.",1407110400,,1486,4.106896551724138
7960638,5,B0000648XM,This movie was very entertaining even though it is definitely targeted towards kids. This was the first Ultraman movie I've seen. I have seen a lot of the TV shows though. This is one of the very few Ultraman movies to be released on American DVD and since it is out of print you will pay a premium but if you find it for around $20 it's probably worth it.,1396483200,,356,4.1
7960639,4,B0000648XM,"Ultraman Tiga and Ultraman Dyna and Ultraman Gaia (Kazuya Konaka, 1998)

I freely admit that back in the very early seventies, when I was knee-high to a grasshopper (okay, knee-high to a mutant ant from <em>Them!</em>) and barely out of diapers, that I was an Ultraman fiend. I couldn't get enough of the stuff. Then it disappeared from the after-school rotation sometime in, I think, 1975, and I was left with fond memories. (I vaguely recall a really bad, maybe animated?, American remake in the late seventies-early eighties with a very brief and depressing run, but IMDB is not backing me up on this.) Now, we've catapulted into the digital age. I have DVD box sets of the original first few seasons of the '66 Japanese series. Subtitled, even! I love progress. But as I dug around, I found out that while Ultraman petered out in American syndication over three decades ago, it's never stopped being wildly popular in its native Japan. So I grabbed a couple of more recent movies, as well, to see how much catching up I need to do. Answer: a whole lot.

It shouldn't surprise me in the least that the human form of Ultraman, originally played by a staid, grounded salaryman-looking guy, slowly morphed over the years into something more resembling a visual kei character. The new human form of Ultraman (Ultraman Gaia, anyway; given the movie's title here [it was also released under the name <em>Ultraman Gaia: Battle in Hyperspace</em>]), at least the new human form in 1998, is played by Takeshi Yoshioka, a friendly-seeming, attractive young chap who's made a career out of playing Ultraman Gaia (he most recently appeared in the role in 2008, as of this writing). He's brought from the parallel universe where the Ultraman stories have always taken place into our universe by Tsutomu (Gaku Hamada, recently of <em>Fish Story</em>), a pre-teen with a major Ultraman fetish. (I can relate!) One day, a strange glowing red ball falls (almost literally) into Tsutomu's hands, and before he realizes what it is, he wishes he could really meet his superhero idol. And, poof, there's Gamu, the human form of Ultraman Gaia, showing up in his fighter plane (also sleeker than the original, natch). Gamu, Tsutomu, and Tsutomu's friends must figure out why the wishing ball (as they come to call it) has suddenly come to Earth, how Gamu can get back to his own world, and how to keep the ball out of those who would use it for harm, all while avoiding the authorities, who are quite concerned about Gamu's sudden appearance in Tsutomu's life, not to mention the airspace over Tokyo.

About half the time, I had no clue at all what was going on, since I've been away from the mythology of the series for as long as I have (and even returning to it, I went right back to 1966). But once I got into the swing of things, it didn't matter a bit; it's just a barrels-of-fun action flick with cute-kid protagonists, Tokyo getting destroyed (again!), neat monsters, and just enough meta from the concept to allow it to poke fun at itself while still delivering a very good time. Not deathless cinema by any means, but if you, too, were an Ultraman freak as a kid, there's a wealth of new material out there that never got imported; this piece of it, at least, is worth hunting down. *** 1/2",1307664000,,3280,4.690972222222222
7960640,5,B0000648XM,"This movie is great. The only problem I had was with the horrible enghish acting. I just change the audio to japanese with the eng subs. Other than that,I would recommend this movie to fans,but it seems this one was ment for kids.",1140048000,2,230,4.372093023255814
7960641,5,B0000648XM,"I used to watch Ultraman everyday without fail when I was a kid.  I bought this and let my kids watch and they love it too (to my surprise).  Watching it now I can see the simple underlying moral of the story.  Ultraman is a good hero.  It's a great break from the slightly depraved Cartoon Network and Disney programming.  And the direction is astonishing.  Even without the subtitles, the story comes through clearly.  My next purchase is the Tiga series.",1104364800,8,457,4.567901234567901
7960642,4,B0000648XM,"I am a fan of Ultraman since I was a kid. I grew sick and tired of it as time goes by. Until I watched the first episode of Ultraman Gaia (series). It isn't the same old boring storyline with lousy special effects anymore. It somehow left the image of a children's program and became a science fiction drama. The most important thing is... There are two Ultramen teaming up to help fight baddies... And Ultraman Agul & Ultraman Gaia are cool!!!
Besides Gaia, Ultraman Cosmos is cool too. Check out his first movie, Ultraman Cosmos: The First Contact. They worked a lot of CG in this movie to improve all flying and fighting effects.
I hope its DVDs, preferably to be dubbed in Japanese (original vocal) with English subtitles, will be available real soon.",1073001600,7,755,4.6
7960643,4,B0000648XM,"Enjoyed this movie and it's even better than its predecessor, Ultraman Tiga & Ultraman Dyna. This one has all the ingredients of a traditional action-packed fun Ultraman movie (and good acting from the two main characters of whom one is only a very young kid) without being too cheesy (in fact, this is the least cheesy after the dark Ultraman Tiga- The Final Odyssey).
As a fan of Ultraman, I just hope the superb Ultraman Tiga- The Final Odyssey gets dubbed in English and released on DVD as well as the hilarious (no pun intended) Ultraman Zearth movies, which are gems.",1062979200,6,573,4.683168316831683
