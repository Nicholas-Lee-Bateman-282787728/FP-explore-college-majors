I laughed and snorted my way through the movie. I about choked when the whole pack changed. I think they forgot the fur on the arms and feet of one. I spit out my water I laughed so hard. Campers, guides, and thieves abound in this hilarious tale of werewolves and revenge. No, they're not extinct! (You'll have to watch it to find out, lol.)

A mix mash of characters weave through out the tale. From old and senile to young and hot, this group of friends eats and drinks their way through the film. Told as a story in a book a nosy private eye reads, Crying Wolf is entertaining from beginning to end.",1455408000,2,755,4.309859154929577

7554239,4,B018R8MMO8,"This is a not for everyone film that I enjoyed. Sorry.

This is a light comedy werewolf story with a taste of cheese. Top billed Caroline Munro had a bit part. The main story (there are numerous sub stories that may or may not be meaningful) is about a group of werewolves going camping to bond as a pack. They are lead to a place by two non-werewolf guides with their own agenda. For some reason werewolf Emma (Rosie Pearson) brings along her non-werewolf step-sister. They also pick up two hitchhikers along the way, who also have their own agenda. The main story (which is read from a book) has a number of people who tell stories. There are some things that don't make sense, but are explained by narration in a pub scene where a bloody Andy (Kristofer Dayne) claims his girlfriend was just killed by a werewolf. Andy of course likes to play jokes and is accused by everyone of ""Crying Wolf.""

There was a lot of blood and killing. The werewolf costumes seemed cumbersome and most of their moving scenes is done in fast motion. The faces had baboon like coloration. They weren't bad for a low budget production. The acting was as expected, including the cheese. While I didn't have any laugh out loud moments, There were a few scenes which made me smile.

The film included a number of lines that were a bit cliche and others that seemed appropriate: ""I wonder what the locals taste like."" and ""He smells familiar.""

Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Nudity (Rosie Pearson, Alyssa Noble, Chloe Farnworth, Lisa Ramon, Olivia Jewson, Gwellian Higginson)",1450569600,10,1544,4.644688644688645
7554250,3,B018R8MMO8,"Ok, let's go thru the checklist for making a goof a rama horror movie....
Cheesy script... CHECK
off the street actors...CHECK
cheesy CGI effects...CHECK
Rubber werewolf masks...CHECK
Cheap but effective amounts of gore...CHECK
Randomly offbeat sound effects and music...CHECK
Tit shots...CHECK
Random humor inserted thru out the flick...CHECK
Best part of the movie is when it's over...CHECK

YEP....this movie has it all....BUT...I got thru it with a family sized bag of Cheetos, a six pack and a bong.
Wasn't the worst movie I've seen....that was The Frog from the 70's...and I did laugh at some of the crap that went
on, and was impressed with some of the gore shots.  Not a bad movie, kind of off beat and thrown together and as the credits
rolled you got to see behind the scene footage that was pretty great in displaying that the crew and actors had a jolly good
time filming it.
I'd watch again, with the grand kids, as they would be scared of the hairy werewolves, and I just love scaring the wee ones with a bit of
ridiculous monster features now and then.",1484697600,3,1067,4.731182795698925
7554251,3,B018R8MMO8,"This was an...interesting movie, to say the least. It centers mainly on a group of cliched werewolf characters going on a camping trip in the country to better bond as a pack. But of course it's never that simple as drama unfolds and characters are not what they seem. It's hard to define this movie's tone. It had many of the elements I expected such as obvious CGI blood and werewolf effects of varying quality. However, I found myself pleasantly surprised by this film. If you look at it purely from a critical perspective, yeah it's far from perfect. For one thing, the tone is somewhat inconsistent, especially in the first act. For example, it might go from character drama and gore in one scene but then switch over to cartoon sound effects and tangents. There are a few subplots, none of which really get wrapped up in a satisfying way. Most of the characters are unlikable. The film has some trouble keeping focus, often switching to different scenes or side stories that disrupt the overall flow. However, the longer I watched it, the goofier the story became and I realized how intentional a lot of the tone was. But the time you get to the finale, the movie has abandoned all preconceptions of being a horror and became a fun, cheesy action movie. With the amount of stupid humor in the second and third acts, it's undeniable that the filmmakers wanted to make a fun B-Movie. I kinda think they succeeded. For what it's worth, I was never confused about character motivations, though many of the people felt pointless. The only thing that goes unexplained is how or why the book appeared, but it really doesn't matter. As a film, yeah it lacks character growth, the effects aren't great and everyone's kinda an idiot. The framing device serves almost no purpose, though I think the actor that plays the investigator could have a future narrating ads. It's a flawed film but an entertainingly weird one. I don't know who I would recommend this too. It's too much in on the joke to be ironically enjoyed, and too cheesy to be great horror. The humor is often predicable and many of the film's weaknesses would turn off most people. But if you're like me and find these types of B-Movies interesting then I don't think it'd waste your time. I kinda enjoyed it and you might too.",1484611200,3,2287,4.621621621621622

Jopia's story is a fun, quick-witted twist to the Werewolf tale. The movie places the beast as unsuspecting prey against the vengeful. ""Crying Wolf"" has some colorful and interesting characters that are well developed. Some more so than others. The film is more comedy than horror, but with plenty of spooky nicely shot scenes offering the creature in all its costumey glory. I enjoyed the beast- visually and characteristically in ""Crying Wolf"". Plus the cast give nice performances as the individuals in the pack.

The special effects are a mixed bag of cool, gory practical effects, and weak disappointing CGI. Jopia does choose the moments for CGI very wisely and frames the scenes in a creative way that make watching the CGI easier for those of us who find the computer animation a turn-off in horror. Oddly enough the thing that makes "" Crying Wolf"" fall a bit flat is the hokey way the story is set up as comedic schtick, vignettes and flashbacks combined with a cheesy soundtrack more reminiscent of soap operas and webseries.

Overall ""Crying Wolf"" falls somewhere in the middle of good and bad. There are some quality moments where story and character really entertain and thrill, then there are those pesky times when CGI and dialog fail to sell the story. As a werewolf story this one is weak at beast, as a Brit horror/Comedy it is mediocre, but as for creative , Indie story- ""Crying Wolf manages a decent and sometimes amusing tale. The creature design and wittiness are the best aspects for sure!",1459382400,2,1541,4.829545454545454
