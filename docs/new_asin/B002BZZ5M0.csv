8362632,5,B002BZZ5M0,"The Inbetweeners (2008-2010) is a raucous award winning British comedy, which follows the adventures of four schoolmates, as they deal with situations typically encountered by boys of that age, school, girls, cars, drinking alcohol, and sex.  While featuring plenty of crude and vulgar elements, the humor has a certain level of sophistication and irony, as things seldom turn out well for these boys.

The Inbetweeners are Will (Simon Bird), Simon (Joe Thomas), Jay (James Buckley), and Neil (Blake Harrison), all students at Rudge Park Comprehensive school, the equivalent of American high school.  Those not familiar with British slang, may miss some of the comic ""nuances"", but the general meaning of most of the humor should still be understandable to Americans.  Controversial and offensive, The Inbetweeners isn't for everyone, as the edgy and clever writing, often crosses the line of good taste, however if you can appreciate the particular point of view, may find themselves highly amused by this bawdy British comedy.

Featuring the arrival of Will into a new school, and his integration into a group of existing friends, Series 1 is a good time.  After a year together, the kinds of activities the boys get involved in Series 2, are even more outrageous and hilarious.  Extras include a number of commentary tracks by the four principal actors, which provides some insight into how they relate to each other, and their real personalities.

For those unfamiliar with British TV, ""series"" is the rough equivalent of ""season"" in American TV.  Series 1 (2008) and 2 (2009), each contain 6 half hour episodes.  This set packages the two previously released series' DVD's, in a slip-over case.  Now that the program has completed its three season run, and the entire series is now available in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/three-DVD-set/dp/B0074JOD8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">three DVD set</a>, the interest in this particular set might not be that high, so you may be able to get it at a good price at Amazon. UK.  Be advised that these are Region 2 releases, and most will need a region-free player to view the discs.",1372550400,,2175,5.309037900874635
8362633,5,B002BZZ5M0,"I love this show and now owning it on DVD, my life is complete because I can laugh until I have stitches in my side.  I have never seen a more honest representation of teenage life (next to Skins) on TV, nor laughed this hard.  The characters are dynamic and there is growth over the six episodes so that you actually care about them and want to know what their next adventure will be.  I just pray that American TV execs don't see this show and ruin it by watering it down and showing it on ABC.  You must have a multi-region DVD player to watch the show.  I bought one just so I could watch this show and Amazon has some really cheap ones that don't require any set up.  It is well worth the purchase of the player for these DVDs.  Enjoy the series and look for new episode airing in September, *friend*!  :)",1282003200,3,810,4.147435897435898
8362634,5,B002BZZ5M0,"Omg this is way too funny ...
This series is obviously based on real life experiences. The acting wasn't great , but i could see a friend from my youth in every one of those characters.
Not all Americans are going to get this humour, after all you guys still think benny hill is great.
Any of you guys who don't see yourself in one of these characters hasn't lived.
From the age of 14 all us guys think about is sex , and this series portrays that perfectly. If your one of those guys who waited for marriage before enjoying a female companion ...  THIS DVD AINT FOR YOU",1272153600,,570,4.181818181818182

Nothing to write more-just rent/buy and watch.",1267833600,4,83,4.533333333333333
8362636,4,B002BZZ5M0,"This show is juvenile, but it's about juveniles, so what do you expect. It's also laugh-out-loud funny. The language is far raunchier than anything on American television, so be warned.

TIP: When purchasing any Region 2 (UK) DVDs, always check Amazon.co.uk for pricing. I bought this set for less than $20.00 - and that included shipping.",1266537600,13,339,5.053571428571429
8362637,4,B002BZZ5M0,"The show is generally sophomoric and low-brow at times, but also funny -- and hey, what do you expect for a show about a group of friends trying to survive high school and get girls?  I'd call it a guilty pleasure, except that it's not actually dumb. It's not exactly realistic, but you can tell that a lot of it is based on the real-life experiences of the writers. I thoroughly enjoy watching it and hope the DVD comes out in the U.S. format.",1266451200,5,444,4.285714285714286
