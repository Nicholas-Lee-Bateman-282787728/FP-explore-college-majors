8165646,4,B000M24ZD4,"The story seems to have been contrived. Yet if you suspend some disbelief it does a good job of making one ponder the true fact of racial bias even among scientists in the 19th century. The photography is beautiful and there are some transformations in the scientists that are quite interesting as their various interests in their reputations and in the pygmies play out. The film does a good job of holding up a disturbing mirror to the constricted and culturally biased mind set of the scientists. That general fact is historically true.

The story itself is probably not true. Pygmies have been known since ancient Egyptian times and it gives the impression that these scientists were the first to find them. But that did not ruin the film for me. I don't expect much historical precision from films of this sort. Another unlikely thing that may be a distraction for many viewers is that the pygmies never talked to each other!!! Highly improbable!! But the film was not about the pygmies, it was about the fumbling of the scientists.

So -- the film opens with some beautiful jungle shots and Fiennes, a British scientist, and Thomas, a seasoned African explorer and animal dealer are fighting off unidentified Africans in the course of kidnapping, that is ""collecting,"" two pygmies, which they then sneak back to Britain among cages of wild animals. To the scientist and his collaborators in Britain, these fabled pygmies are the missing link between apes and humans and they set out to prove it with careful measurements of the skulls etc. Of course scientists really did such things once, and much racism was based on the belief that even most blacks were sub-human, and pygmies being little were thought by some to be even more primitive. Much of the film has to do with the arguments between the scientists and Thomas about how to treat their pygmies. They wear down only slowly and not all of the team does agree that they are human. The darned pygmies do not talk even to each other and this is impossible for me to believe. I have to assume that the filmmakers want us to assume that they were so depressed that they clammed up. Maybe. But their silence did help the film along in the sense that it kept the scientists guessing, and this gave us a window into their mind-set, which is really the point of the film.

Finally Fiennnes comes to feel strongly that they are human and pulls some stunts to try to make the point and influence public opinion. He gets into terrible trouble with his colleagues who want desperately to get the credit for discovering the missing link. A lot of the film towards the end has to do with the fighting between the scientists.

I won't say how the film ends. I will only say that if you are prepared to suspend some disbelief, this is a nice film that can help us recall an era when scientists were having a lot of trouble being objective about the humanity of other human beings. Of course much of society still struggles with such issues to a lesser or greater degree. The film can provide some things to discuss for those who care to think about such issues seriously. Others will criticize it for being ""over the top"" or not believable, and in a sense it is.

Aside from some sparks that are visible during one particular scene late in the movie, these simulacrums are very life-like. It's almost enough to convince you that pygmies are real!",1286841600,,257,5.0
