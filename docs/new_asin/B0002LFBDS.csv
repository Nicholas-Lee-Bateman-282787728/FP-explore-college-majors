8028802,3,B0002LFBDS,"I enjoyed this Russian import, to a point. The animation has a simple and engaging style, and this presents 'Through the Looking Glass' as well as 'Wonderland' - something too often missed. For those things, I give this version high marks.

A number of other features reduce my over-all rating, though. The text of each was edited down to a half hour or so, and they might  have taken some liberties with TtLG. Then, each piece was cut into four segments, with opening and closing credits for each, interruptions that added nothing. I listened to the English sound track instead of the Russian. Actually, in addition to the Russian, since the English voice-over added to but didn't replace the original. At times, I simply couldn't follow the English layer, since the Russian came through so strongly. Even then, livelier voice actors would have made the English work better. Hard to follow already, the weak inflection and odd pauses, made it even less worth following.

As an animation and as an Alice, it was pleasant enough. The poor English overlay made it much less of an experience than the original Russian must have been, though.

8028803,4,B0002LFBDS,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

REVIEW OF THIS 1981-82 PRODUCTION OF ALICE IN WONDERLAND . . .
It is interesting to see what non-English speaking cultures do with the British born story of Alice in Wonderland. Of the 40 plus Alice productions I've viewed to date, several come from ""foreign"" contributors in France, Japan, the Czech Republic, and Korea/Germany. Probably the number one reason I decided to try and watch every version of AIW in existence is because of how each production renders the book so uniquely. Each and every AIW version is a distinct rendering of someone's vision of how to convert Lewis Carroll's words into moving pictures.

Nowhere is this uniqueness more apparent than the AIW offerings from other countries. And now we have a recent entry from Russia! It's actually a 1981 production that recently found its way onto Amazon. The jacket design is the first clue to the individuality of this production. In viewing it you might infer that this is a 'jokey' installation of AIW, a cartoon, and with imagery that is both unique and at the same time adorable.

Right on all counts. The number one reason to buy this DVD is to enjoy the remarkable imagery employed in this animated telling of both `Alice in Wonderland' and `Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There'. The stories are [thankfully] told in two separate installments, with Looking Glass actually having been produced the following year in 1982. Anyway, I could try and describe this beautifully rendered Russian imagery, but just a glance at the Cheshire cat on the DVD cover tells the story. The entire cartoon reeks of this playful approach to bringing Lewis Carroll's characters to life.

Obviously the animators were not concerned about taking a hint from John Tenniel's illustrations, so the next logical question is, how close does this cartoon follow the storyline and dialog of the book? This has actually become my key question as I unwrap each new Alice production that comes my way. Are we going to experience scrupulous enactments of each passage of the book (each of Alice's discrete adventures), related in the correct order, with no mixing of the two books? And are we going to hear Lewis Carroll's textual descriptions and dialog as written? No. This just doesn't happen. Every production departs from the book(s), it's just a question of degree.

With this cartoon you get the ""standard deviation pattern"" of so many Alice installments whereby many, but never all, of the book's passages are rendered, combined with [at times] a strict verbalization of the original dialog which punctually veers off into adhoc, nothing-to-do-with-Carroll dialog. So, no, this is not the Holy Grail Alice production a purist may be wondering about. However, besides being a fun ride, the animators have incorporated some elements from the book you may have never seen before. For example, recall in the book when Alice is falling down the rabbit hole. She has this thought; ""I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward!"" Well, the animators decided to actually illustrate people on the other side of the Earth walking upside down. Why has no once else ever thought to do this!?

At another moment in the rabbit hole Alice thinks ""'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?'"". Well guess what. We get to see that thought played out in a visual form. We also get to see a visual of when Alice thinks of sending a pair of boots to her feet once a year, while super-sized in the Hall of Doors. These are the kinds of elements, along with the cool animation, that endeared this version of AIW to me.

As mentioned, the DVD also includes `Through the Looking Glass...'. The same animators are at work here bringing us the same Russian inspired imagery. We see the Red and White King and Queen not clothed in their original `Michelin Man"" Tenniel style wardrobe, but rather Czar inspired Imperial layered costumes. We see a Jabberwock, not rendered as an evil monster, but rather a jokey cartoon figure. On the other hand we get a full reading of the Jabberwocky poem!

Notes: The Amazon description states that subtitles are in English, German, and French, but on my DVD it is actually English, Russian, and French.
