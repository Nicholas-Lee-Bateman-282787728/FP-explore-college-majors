7866344,2,630423550X,"Sam Firstenberg, the filmmaker instrumental to bringing ninja movies to Hollywood, rapidly lost steam following&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revenge-of-the-Ninja/dp/B000092Q4V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revenge of the Ninja</a>. His two-year alliance with karate man David Bradley didn't yield any particularly special films, and among them, ""Blood Warriors"" is the least special. An inharmonious dramatic thriller with chunks of action floating around in it, this is a borderline-boring movie that's big on awkwardness but low on satisfying adrenaline scenes.

The story: a troubled former Marine (Bradley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Justice/dp/6303945708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Justice</a>) is sent to Jakarta to investigate the dealings of his presumed-dead ex-partner (Frank Zagarino,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Revenger/dp/B000UNYJJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Revenger</a>). Once there, he is caught up in a violent drug feud and a romantic relationship with his partner's sister (Jennifer Campbell, ""Robin's Hoods"").

It should be known that this is virtually the only film wherein David Bradley has taken on a role in addition to his acting: he also co-wrote the screenplay. I may be able to guess his influence in how there is a lot more focus on dramatic content than action (more on that soon) and how his character, a Texan, requires him to exercise some acting muscles. Sometimes his accent works, but his cowboy hat never does. He also turns out to have a pretty good singing voice, but his shoulder-miming style of guitar-playing is silly. (SPOILER) When Frank Zagarino's character finally shows up, he gives a very over-the-top performance as a maniacal villain, which is entertaining in its own right but no explanation is given for just what a rotter he is. That's the major failing of the film: if you're going to skimp on the action, then the writing should be working pretty hard, but while you can see the attempts at dramatic elements, it just doesn't work, with too few character motivations left unexplained and too slow a pace throughout the film's first half.

The action is serviceable when it's there, and more substantial scenes would have earned this a higher rating. Bradley has a few moments of outstanding flexibility and athleticism, but he only has two fight scenes of any substance. One-name wonder Tanaka (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rage-Honor-2/dp/B0000C9JFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rage & Honor 2</a>) has the best brawl of the bunch against a group of attackers, but it's still nothing special. The majority of the action is comprised of shootouts (featuring some of the dumber gunmen I've seen) and two chase scenes, in a car and then on a speedboat. You have to wait through innumerable dramatic scenes before you get to them, but they're not really worth waiting for. The best you can do is to watch the tape with your thumb trained on the fast-forward button.

I like the look of movies shot in Indonesia more than, say, those shot in the Philippines, but the cinematography here isn't noteworthy. On the bright side, most of the Indonesian costars here (especially Frans Tumbuan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Java-Heat/dp/B00D6I7G00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Java Heat</a>) seem more comfortable with English than the average bunch, making for a more professional-sounding film. But still, the action isn't strong enough to sustain its relatively small ration, and the characters aren't intriguing enough to carry the movie otherwise. Though the film is somewhat of a collector's item for David Bradley fans, I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to buy it.",1410048000,,3863,6.08256880733945
