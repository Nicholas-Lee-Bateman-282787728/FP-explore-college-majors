7877565,5,6304756356,"Excellent film version of an excellent book, by the great Spanish author Perez-Riverte who worked on the script. In the style of The Mysteries of Lisbon by Raoul Ruiz, with gorgeous sceneries  la Visconti, beautifully filmed and filled with suspense and romance.
The seller was unusually well informed and generous, answering questions immediately. I would buy other products from him.",1371168000,,385,5.416666666666667
7877566,5,6304756356,Viewing this movie lead me to read several of Arturo Perez Reverte's novels.  The movie is a dance of mystery and romance with outstanding performances. Perez Reverte is a master in creating female characters who are strong and who take on male roles. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in movies with interesting plots not just action scenes.,1356566400,,351,4.85
7877567,4,6304756356,"This is a stylish, shadowed mystery set in 19th century Spain and built around the relationship between the aging fencing virtuoso Don Jaime de Astarloa (Omero Antonutti) and his intruiging, beautiful pupil, Adela de Otero (the lovely and talented Assumpta Serna).  Although the plot drags at times and is not particularly unpredictable, the quality of the acting, cinematography (full of shadows, mist and opulent period rooms) and fencing scenes set it well apart from the average Blockbuster fare.  And, at a curt 88 minutes, it can provide a swift, bittersweet diversion in even the busiest week or weekend.  Que bueno.",982972800,15,623,5.21
7877568,4,6304756356,"Excellent adaptation of the book, but the book was better. The content of the letter is not revealed in the movie, but one can assume the content from the conversation. Probably rated PG-13. At times, it is slow. The English subtitles are generally OK, but it's best appreciated in Spanish. There were several fencing bouts and some of them were well done. Overall, a good fiction drama placed in Madrid during mid 1860s. The scenography is realistic for the time. The main character does not seem as strong and anticuated as in the book. If you like fencing, this is an excellent movie.",955929600,10,587,4.70873786407767
