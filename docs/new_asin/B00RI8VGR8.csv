6931733,5,B00RI8VGR8,"These are great workouts!  Have all three sets of her DVDs and just love them.  Dasha is so right about following a program!!  With these workouts and her guided program, I have lost twenty pounds, feel great, and have much better mobility, strength and balance.  This has become my go to program for over a year now and for many more to come.  Dasha is so positive, provides great guidance on form and you just get the sense she really cares and loves what she does.  Kudos to her programs!!",1422921600,9,492,4.411111111111111
6931734,4,B00RI8VGR8,I bought this dvd set because it said that it was advance and is probably for advance people but I did not find it to be as challenging as I thought it would be but is still a good intensity and to be honest a doubt that you will burn 1000 calories like its promised. This set has two dvd and is Tabata style. If you have done Insanity or any of the real advance programs you will not find this very challenging but is still good intensity and kind of fun.,1422662400,11,456,3.967391304347826

8695382,1,B00RI8VGR8,"What a horrible exercise DVD.After owning over 200 exercise at home dvds and training with the best- Jillian Michaels, Beach Body, on demand lesmills, gilad , Karen Voight - I can honestly say this is the worst exercise DVD ever. I have attempted to do each dvd in the box but have never made it past 15 minutes. I just shut it off and went  for the professionals
Cons:
- Such bad choreography- this is not an actual gym so when we purchase such a costly dvd I expect excellent choreography. Every gal is doing her own thing at her own pace her own way. The camera moves on one then the other you never know what to do.
-When the instructor is working she is out of breath and keeps saying I am doing this with you. Cant understand half the things she is saying , there is no rythym to her instruction or advice. Shes just babbling half words and oh my god does she go on and on - you just tune out , it's like she is a bar talking to her girlfriends  . we expect her to do the exercises with us, its a home dvd! But she should honestly  take lessons from Jillian or Cathe in how a home dvd should be designed.
-She took "" doing your own thing"" very seriously. I consider my home dvds my personal trainer- Its effective, rhythmic, and very accurate- But the instructor has failed at the above.
-Will be returning. In short save your money .",1473638400,2,1340,4.166023166023166
8695383,1,B00RI8VGR8,"As an advanced exerciser, I found this to be really slow and boring. There were way too many breaks and the production was low quality and kind of painful. I was really excited to give this a shot after reading the other reviews and had no interest at all to ever do this again. I honestly did not break a sweat and needed to do a different workout afterwards to feel like I did anything.",1473465600,2,388,4.1866666666666665

8695388,5,B00RI8VGR8,"Im never not impressed with KBB workoutspretty much everyone knows Im a fangirl. But I realized two things today that seemed rather important:

1. Normally I loathe tabatas. But these ones here, in Scorcher 2.0? Awesome-super fun. Id do these everyday.

2. Prior to committing to KBB, I used to get injured. A lot. Nothing major, just pulled the same hamstring over and over, lower back ache, that kind of thing. But since KBB became my go to program for keeping fit, I haven't pulled that crappy left hamstring once. My back and core is way strong. Overall, Im just much more durable. I am convinced this is because I do kettlebell kickboxing.

Now, my actual review of Scorcher 2.0as I mentioned, I don't care for tabatas. The scorcher tabatas didn't make me fall in love right away, but they didn't immediately make me want to run screaming from the room either. Probably the second or third time through the dvds was when I really started to enjoy myself. Plus theres some moves Id never even seen before, let alone attempted (swing squat, anyone??). These babies are major calorie burners, and they go by quick! It doesnt feel like most 50 minute workoutswhen you're done, you're sweating bullets wondering where the time went.
I really enjoy Dasha and her cohortsthe smiles, laughs and sweat are all genuine, and Im proud to workout with these ladies.",1438214400,12,1357,4.76595744680851
8695389,5,B00RI8VGR8,"I am a huge fan of Dasha Libin and all of her videos. I am lucky enough to attend her classes personally once in a while in New York City, but when I can not get there, this series does the trick. Although I participate in a variety of sports and fitness programs, this is the only one that I feel gives me an ENTIRE body workout in a short and intense amount of time. All muscle groups are addressed in a heart-pumping cardio/weight/martial movement hybrid that is fun and interesting.",1428537600,5,486,4.351648351648351
