8414705,5,B0043CT91M,"Janacek's Cunning little Vixen is a very good place to start appreciating Janacek's operas as it is essentially much more accessible than some of his other works which deal with particularly difficult human situations. This opera is firmly based on the woodland animal world surrounding the life of a vixen and her interaction with the woodsman who initially captures her and subsequently tries to keep her as a pet. She escapes.

The story follows the group of animals and the small group of humans as they age. The human group interact with each other and also with the woodland world. The animals do the same in reverse. Both groups inevitably clash with each other but continue to behave in their own particular ways. Basically Janacek is writing an opera showing how life continually moves on and recycles.

Janacek first came across this story as a novella `Adventures of Vixen Sharp-Ears' which was published in 51 parts in a literary journal before being turned into book form. It is still in print. He immediately wanted to write the opera despite advice to the contrary. He stated that for years he had listened to the animals, memorising their speech. He declared ""I am at home with them."" He later confided that this score was the favourite of all his operas.

All this can all be enjoyed at a fairly superficial level as a simple tale. It can also be seen as rather moralistic which may well be what inspired Janacek to write it bearing in mind his close identification with the language of the animals.

The delightful story is beautifully performed with all the sympathy you would expect from such an experienced Janacek specialist as Mackerras. The cast is uniformly excellent and the staging makes imaginative use of rapidly changing scenery flats. The costumes are equally imaginative and brightly coloured giving a visually attractive air to all the woodland scenes.

In more detail it should be mentioned that Thomas Allen is ideally cast as the aging forester who is still able to take a delight in his woodland surroundings. His voice is as mellifluously pleasant as always. The fox is wonderfully cast with just the right air of knowing worldliness being portrayed by Hana Minutillo. The cock and hens section is mildly amusing with the hens gently clucking as an unscripted background chattery noise. However Eva Jenis as the vixen is the star of the opera with a delightfully childlike approach to her role. She is young and sprightly enough to be completely charming. Her eventual death comes as a considerable dramatic shock.

The various wood land animals are `danced' largely by adults and this brings an extra dimension of gentle adult imagination and humour that is not present to the same extent in the recent Blu-ray alternative which relies on a cast of children for the same roles.

The widescreen imaging of this 1995 production remains sharp without having the ultimate Blu-ray definition. It is typical of the reliable standards of the Brian Large team. The sound is in stereo only but such is the pleasure of the production that one quickly adjusts although it is necessary to raise the volume by several decibels to obtain best results.

As a performance and production this is an easy 5 stars but because of the stereo only option and the presence of a good rival Blu-ray version (the Paris recording on Medici Arts conducted by Dennis Russell Davies), I feel it is only fair to comment that for these reasons some purchasers would drop a star. However, for many collectors, this Mackerras version would still be a 5 star issue.",1456531200,,3569,4.86820428336079
8414706,4,B0043CT91M,"I've watched (and listened to) several performances on DVD and there's something entrancing about this version--the costumes are witty, and the little vixen is a delight.",1392163200,,170,5.576923076923077
8414707,5,B0043CT91M,"Imaginative production, true to the story line and libretto. Costumes for the insects are... well, watch for the ""Mosquito"" who sports a hypodermic needle as nose... very funny, and appropriate! Tom Allen: a lovely, heartfelt Forrester; Eva Jenis plays the Vixen with wit and sensitivity, whilst Hanna Minutillo manages to play the Fox as a total ""guy"" with charm galore. Sir Charles Mackerras was a Janacek specialist, and he leads the performance into an imaginative land -- but don't think it's ""safe"" -- for Death resides in this realm too, and the radiant music leads us to the sure knowledge and acceptance of the Cycle of Life. This rendition is very beautiful, and highly recommended.",1385251200,,692,5.026086956521739
8414708,5,B0043CT91M,"In his review, Mr. Bruno compares this DVD to a previously released Chatelet production, pronouncing the new one superior. I have the old one, released on the Image label, and the venue, conductor, director, costume designer, choreographer, year of recording and entire cast list are identical to those of this new release. I conclude that this Kultur DVD is a re-release of the same performance.",1293148800,20,396,5.107692307692307
8414709,5,B0043CT91M,"Those are the themes of Janacek's most vivacious opera ""The Cunning Little Vixen"", written in 1924 when the composer was seventy years old. Based on a Czech cartoon story, the opera tells of an aging Huntsman who captures a Vixen (a female fox) cub and raises her as a pet. Eventually the Vixen escapes back to nature, mates and has dozens of babies, and is finally killed by a poacher. The Huntsman, in the final scene, laments the death of his Vixen but celebrates the beauty of the forest and the Life Force it embodies. He sees a young vixen, obviously the 'daughter' of his Vixen, and feels himself revivified by the continuity of love and life. The Huntsman's climactic aria is one of the most moving expressions of affirmation in all of music.

This is the second release of a staging of ""The Cunning Little Vixen"" by the Chatelet Theatre de Paris, and it is even better than the first, which was already very fine. Many of the elements of the production are the same: both conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, both featuring Eva Jenis as the Vixen and Thomas Allen as the Huntsman. Mackerras is superb in both recordings; no one else delivers the vibrancy of Janacek's orchestrations as wellas he does. Eva Jenis is superb in both, with the same saucy resilience and foxy mischievousness. Thomas Allen was superb in the first production and even more marvelous in the second, singing that grand final aria with heart-rending sincerity, committing his whole being to the processes of Nature.

The real superiority of this second release is the dancing. ""Vixen"" is almost half ballet, with all the creatures of the forest - the frog, the mosquito, the rabbits, the birds, and of course the foxes in flamboyantly whimsical costumes. Those costumes were charming in the first staging but they're gorgeous in this second. Likewise the sets have improved from charming to truly beautiful. Most importantly, this staging has 'done the right thing' and hired a real corps of dancers, fully skilled ballet dancers worthy of the music they dance to.

There's no other opera in the repertoire quite like ""The Cunning Little Vixen,"" and it's gratifying to note that ""tout le monde"" has begun to appreciate its brilliance, with more frequent productions in Europe and the USA and with four (4!) available DVDs of it. Of the four, this is easily the most impressive. Don't rent it! Buy it! It's an opera you'll want to hear and watch many times.

CAVEAT: I seem to have messed up. I really thought this was a different production, but it isn't. Though it may be superior in some technical qualities of sound and color, it's the same filming/recording of the 1999 production, which I loved then and would still love today. In the meantime, I've seen four or five or Vixens, and I've probably bundled some subjective impressions of them together in my aging brain. The older DVD is in one of my homes, the newer in another, and the latter has far better equipment for playing it. But no excuses! I deceived myself.

The morals of the story are:
1) It's a great opera and a great production.
2) If you've bought both DVDs on my recommendation, you can broaden somebody's life by giving one away.
3) .... I've forgotten what #3 was ...",1290470400,15,3224,4.719360568383659
