3421233,5,B0018TLRS6,"So, this is the complete Season 3 of Yu-Gi-Oh!  That means that it contains the conclusion of the Battle City Tournament episodes.  Yes, Yugi vs. Marik and all that.  However, even though the Battle City story arc is a good one and Marik is one of the best villains of the show, the true reason why you should buy this is for the Noah episodes.  This set contains both the Virtual World episodes and the Battle City/Enter the Shadow Realm episodes.

The Battle City Semi Finals are over and the Finals are about to begin, but Kaiba wants them to take place in a special location.  But on their way there, they are ""kidnapped"" by this kid named Noah.  You see, Kaiba's blimp is pulled into a secret underwater location by Noah`s advanced technology.  The Big Five (Kaiba`s employees from the Season 1 episode ""Legendary Heroes"") are back!  They have been trapped inside a computer ever since Yugi and Kaiba defeated them with the Dragon Master Knight at the end of ""Legendary Heroes: Part III.""  Now, they want revenge.  They have teamed-up with Noah, a small teenage boy who wants revenge on Kaiba for mysterious, secret reasons.  The Big Five and Noah trap Yugi, Joey, Tea, Tristan, Duke, Serenity, Kaiba, and Mokuba in a virtual world in which the only way to escape is by defeating one of the Big Five members in a duel.  If Yugi and the gang win, they'll  return back to the real world.  But if the Big 5 win, they'll be able to take over their bodies and escape to the their real world in disguise!  Sorry Marik, but you will have to wait because Yugi and the others are trapped in this computer for 24 episodes!

As you know, Season 2 was released on 11 separate DVDs (each with either 4 or 5 episodes) and five Season 3 DVDs that continued with the Marik episodes were also released.  However, to release all of the Marik DVDs right away, the company skipped the Virtual World episodes because they took place at the beginning of Season 3, thus interrupting the Marik episodes.  So this is the first time to own them all on DVD!  The Virutal World saga is my very favorite!

The plot of this season is simply awesome and amazing!  It shows how creative the Yu-Gi-Oh! writers can be.  The animation is also as great as it can be and the voice acting is superb.  We also take a break from Egypt to learn A LOT about Kaiba's childhood.  A LOT!  Since the Big Five lost their bodies, they have each taken the form of a Yu-Gi-Oh! monster card.  This is convenient for them because by doing that, they have a temporary body.  By doing that, they are a duelist and also a Deck Master at the same time.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention: the Big Five and Noah have added a new rule to the game...the Deck Master rule!  A Deck Master is a monster card that the player will have at his/her disposal for the entire duel.  So, the duelist doesn't have to wait to draw that certain monster card, they just have to choose it as their Deck Master and then will be able to play it whenever they want.  However, when you choose to play with your Deck Master, if you lose it, you automatically lose the duel regardless of how many Life Points you have!

""A VIRTUAL NIGHTMARE!""
The intro episode.  On their way to Kaiba Corp Island, the island where Kaiba plans to host the Battle City Finals, Noah and the Big Five trap everyone (except Marik, Ishizu, Odion, Mai, Bakura, and Kaiba's security guards) inside a Virtual World.

""ISOLATED IN CYBER SPACE: PARTS 1, 2, 3""
Noah separates everyone in his Virtual World.  Yugi is left in a lake where he duels against one of the Big Five, Gansley.  His Deck Master is the Deep Sea Warrior and he uses a Water Deck.  Tea is left in a desert-like place where she is chased by Hitotsume Giants.  Joey is left in a building of some sort.  Tristan and Duke are in a castle that apparently has an endless hallway.  Serenity is also by a lake, but unlike Yugi's, her's is inhabited by a Mad Sword Beast.  The Kaiba brothers are in a forest where they revisit their past.

""FREEZE PLAY: PARTS 1, 2""
Tea duels against The Nightmare Penguin.  He's really Crump, one of the members of the Big Five and KaibaCorp's former accountant.  This particular duel is a tricky one because Tea doesn't really know how to duel, and whenever she loses Life Points, a part of her body is frozen in ice.

""COURTROOM CHAOS: PARTS 1, 2""
Joey duels against Johnson, the legal advisor at KaibaCorp and the Big Five's attorney.  He takes the form of the Judge Man during his duel with Joey and the two duel in a courtroom.  Though Joey gets an early lead in the duel, Judge Man's Deck Master ability is one that makes things much, much, much harder for Joey.

""MECHANICAL MAYHEM: PARTS 1, 2""
Tristan, Serenity, and Duke duel against robot-obsessed Nesbitt, the Tech Expert at Kaiba Corp.  He takes the form of Mechanical Knight.  This is one of the hardest duels ever because Tristan and Serenity don't know how to duel very well, and *****POSSIBLE SPOILER***** one of them ends up losing their body...but who?  Is it Duke?  Tristan?  Or Serenity?

""SETTING THE SCORE: PARTS 1, 2""
After Mokuba is kidnapped, Kaiba duels with the last member of Big Five: Leichter.  He takes the form of Jinzo, whose effect makes it hard for Kaiba to win.  Plus, Leichter's/Jinzo's secret weapon is a never-before-seen monster that's almost unstoppable!

""NOAH'S SECRET""
We finally learn why Noah hired the Big Five and wants revenge on Kaiba.  You'll never guess why!  Also, four of the members of the Big Five that were defeated seek revenge on the gang!

""BROTHERS IN ARMS: PARTS 1, 2, 3"" and ""NOAH'S FINAL THREAT: PARTS 1, 2""
Noah duels against Kaiba and Yugi.  Since he controls the Virtual World, Noah keeps on changing their dueling location.  First, the duel takes place in the Jurassic Era by a volcano, then it switches to the Ice Age, and then I'll stop so that I don't ruin the rest of the duel.  By the way, this five episode duel is probably the coolest one in the saga because of Noah's Deck Master.  Also, I think you'll find that the final two episodes (""Noah's Final Threat: Part I"" and ""Noah's Final Threat: Part II"") are the best.  Specially because of what Noah does in order to try to win.  It's kinda extreme and unfair...

""SO CLOSE, YET SO FAR""
Everyone learns who's really behind everything.  Because Noah and the Big Five aren't in this alone...  In addition, Yugi and the gang learn of a sinister plan that puts the entire planet Earth at risk!

""BURYING THE PAST: PARTS 1, 2""
The computer that allows the Virtual World to exist is about to explode and Yugi and the others are still trapped inside!  Can they escape in time?

Okay, I will not go into depth on the following episodes because most of you probably already own them on the separate DVD's that were released like 2 years ago.  Like I said, the real reason to buy this box set is for the Virtual World episodes.

""BACK TO BATTLE CITY: PARTS 1, 2  3""
The gang returns to the Battle City Tournament after their little adventure.  They engage in a special duel that decides who's gonna duel against who in the real Finals.

""THE DARKNESS RETURNS: PARTS 1-4""
Joey vs. Marik

""CLASH IN COLISEUM: PARTS 1-6""
Yugi vs. Kaiba

""BATTLE FOR THE BRONZE: PARTS 1, 2, 3""
Joey vs. Kaiba

""FINAL FACE-OFF: PARTS 1-5""
Yugi vs. Marik!!!!!!!!!!!!!

""ONE FOR THE ROAD""
Kaiba decides to blow up the island where his tournament just took place, but the blimp isn't working because of the events of ""Burying the Past: Part II.""

""LOOKING BACK AND MOVING AHEAD""
A flashback episode that summarizes Marik's role in Seasons 2 and 3.

Well, hope that was detailed enough!  :)

A new rule called the ""Deck Master"" is put into the game. Duelists are allowed to use their deck master ability freely. If a deck master is brought into play and is destroyed, then, that duelist automatically loses and is trapped in the virtual world forever.
Seto and Mokuba are confronted with their past while trapped. Noah Kaiba is out for revenge.
After the gang returns from the virutal world, the blimp lands at Kaiba Corp Island where the rest of the Battle City finals will be held. Another special ability of the Winged Dragon of Ra is revealed. Yugi must defeat Marik in order to save the world and learn the Pharoah's secret.",1210118400,,822,4.4144736842105265

Can't keep up!? Then print it up!! 4Kids said that Funimation is no longer the distributer for Yu-Gi-Oh! My guess whenever they found a distributer they will probably release Yu-Gi-Oh! The Complete 4th Season, anytime in 2009. Feel free to leave a comment, Bye.

P.S. In ""Clash in the Coliseum Part 1"", when Kaiba played Lullaby of obedience, he paid 1000 LP which brought him down to 2000 Lp in Part 2! However this was not mentioned in the Jappense or US Series. It was mentioned the manga.",1209772800,15,2294,4.00218818380744
3421237,5,B0018TLRS6,"I have been a major fan of Yugioh since I was eight years old. I can never stop watching this show, especially seasons 2, 3, 4, and 5. I got season 2 for Christmas three years ago and that DVD never gets old. I've wanted this DVD for quite some time, since the idea of me owning the entire Battle City arc of classic Yugioh blows my mind. Plus, if I thought the experience with the season 2 DVD was great, I would imagine this one being just as good, if not, better. Remember, this DVD shows the climax of Battle City, so anyone who loves this part of the Yugioh saga should definitely make this a top priority on their next Christmas list. The only problem with this DVD, if anything, is the prices that are given from these idiotic sellers. Seriously, why is this happening? $850? $900? $1000? You sellers have to be really stupid if you think you can convince us Yugioh fans to pay that much money for just season 3, especially with the economy being the way it is right now. If you think you can sell any DVD at a price like that, you are sadly mistaken!",1347235200,,1058,4.216748768472907

3421240,5,B0018TLRS6,"The Battle City Duel Monsters Championship Tournament has reached the finals but the ancient Egyptian evil has not lightened its hostilities against the Pharaoh or the Battle City finalists at all. The storyline takes off from the climax of the Battle City qualification rounds & now hits the skies for the final rounds. The level of suspense continues to escalate because the Egyptian evil now walks among the Battle City finalists waiting to engulf them with the Shadow Games. The plot still remains at a high level of mental tension for the progression of the storyline but the pace has slowed down a bit so the dialogue does not get rushed or shortened of any details. The dialogue has a more serious & demanding demeanour in response to the Egyptian evil's threats. This makes the anime series less comedic & more exhilarating.
The voice acting still remains at the same level from the beginning of the Battle City Tournament; Excellent. The fears & worries the characters feel are more prevalent & more lively.
I recommend this anime series to all anime fans, but this is optional since 4Kids modified the dialogue of the anime series. May I ask why 4Kids does this?
Thank you.",1287100800,,1183,4.803921568627451

Together with season 4 season 3, it's the best written, got the best voice acting and some really thrilling plot twists and duels. This season have some of the most dramtic and interesting duels of the entire series.

The video is outstanding, and the set looks great aswell, it delivers what you can expect, the fact that you get all episodes with no gaps for the first time for season 3 is a big plus, aswell with the fact that you can follow the entire ending of the battle city finals that began in season 2.
Unlike other season this season is focuses less on backstories and more on drama, the characters and the duels. DM is one, if not the best, Yu-gi-oh series and this is clearly one of if not the best seasons, it has some of the most memorable duels and introudces some of the most memorable and powerful cards from the Yu-gi-oh trading card game.

Anyone who likes Yu-gi-oh! should get this set, it's one of the best products out there, season 3 together with season 4 have most of the best episodes of the entire series and very few boring episodes, and unlike some people, i enjoy the Noah storyline, it may be a long story arc, but it helps building characters alot, got alot of plot twists and drama aswell.",1222300800,2,1264,4.420600858369099

Although the Noah arc was not a part of the original manga, it is a major plotline in the anime, comprising numerous episodes, and it is referred to in spin-off videogames (Nightmare Troubadour for example) as well being referred back to in later episodes.
