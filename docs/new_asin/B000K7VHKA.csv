2683772,4,B000K7VHKA,"I have 1 boy and 2 girls, I grew up with strawberry shortcake! I love her!

My 3 yr old likes her. I bought this movie for my 3 and 1 yr old daughters and they really enjoyed this movie. My 3 yr old didn't like the purple pie man she said he was a little scary. But he isn't scary just bad!

It doesn't compare to the old strawberry shortcake but it's the new strawberry shortcake for this generation!!",1173312000,2,402,4.0125
2683773,4,B000K7VHKA,"""The Sweet Dreams Movie"" is the first ever CGI film for the ""Strawberry Shortcake"" series. It was shown in limited release in theatres and is now available on DVD.

Positives:

- To me, the CGI animation really isn't bad. Though I was thrown off by the look of it at first, I quickly grew used to it. I found some of it to actually be rather nice-looking. I also thought that the characters looked for the most part like they do in the TV show. Certainly a better effort to me than the CGI for ""Clifford's Really Big Movie"" (mediocre) and ""Arthur's Missing Pal."" (Not good at all.)

- Music and songs --- the best highlight of the film. ""How a Garden Grows"" is a fast-paced, standout song and very catchy. A couple of other fun songs include ""All it Takes"" and ""The Land of Dreams."" The songs overall are berry nice and drive the plot along.

- Characters - This film introduces a number of new characters to the series. Doing this sort of thing is always a bit of a tightrope, but I think all of the new characters work fairly well here. Raspberry Torte, works well as a reluctant protagonist (looking out for Lemon Meringue) and even though the series doesn't necessarily need villains to make it interesting, Purple Pie Man and his sister Sour Grapes fill the role well enough.

- Story - A decent enough plotline, though a bit slow-starting. The Land of Dreams was a fun place to visit and I wouldn't mind seeing it in the series again.

Negatives:

- No special features other than Spanish subtitles and previews for other releases on this DVD. Most of the other ""Strawberry Shortcake"" DVDs at least have a music video and other such direct-to-video (or near direct-to-video) DVD releases have managed to put together at least reasonably interesting special features, so there's no reason why this shouldn't have any.

- Strawberry Shortcake's sister Apple Dumplin' is once again absent-without-leave, a disappointment, as she is one of the best characters in the series. Huckleberry Pie and Blueberry Muffin are also nowhere to be found.

This film, per the closing credits, was dedicated with love to Pam Carter, who served as a voice director for the series.",1173139200,4,2166,4.678947368421053
2683774,2,B000K7VHKA,"I purchased this movie for my kid sisters and I was extremely disappointed in it. The characters in the movie weren't like the characters in the shorter videos like ""Strawberry Shortcake In Ice Cream Island or Cooking up Fun."" The appearance of the characters were more digital and phony. They appeared to have a latex type of face and body. They also didn't sound the same as they do in the other videos.

As far as the story it wasn't bad. The sleep bug was sooooo cute. You got to see the sandman and how he makes dreams. I think if they left the characters they same as they were in the other videos I would've enjoyed it more and so would've my sisters.",1172188800,8,658,4.306451612903226

2683785,4,B000K7VHKA,I gave the rating that I did because of the smile on my kid's face and the speed in which it took to arrive.  Based on that I would recommend it to others.,1400630400,,155,3.696969696969697
2683786,5,B000K7VHKA,Mum bought this movie for my kids both under four. Sweet dreams is the first strawberry shortcakes they have seen. It has been watched 5 times in the last 3 days. They love it. Such a cute film. I like that the bad guys aren't really scary at all.,1374105600,,247,4.061224489795919

2683789,5,B000K7VHKA,"I like this new version better than the even newer version of Strawberry Shortcake.  They kept the girls looking like little girls and non glammed-up teenagers. This movie is cute, sweet and the ""bad guys"" are pretty benign.  Please bring this version back!!",1299369600,,258,4.976744186046512
2683790,5,B000K7VHKA,My daughter who is only 14 months loves this movie.  This is Strawberry Shortcake without all of the new Bratz style makeover.  The songs are real catchy and I find my wife singing the songs to my daughter who responds with a big smile on her face.  There is a villain called the Pieman but he isn't too scary.  Overall a great movie for toddlers.,1288137600,,347,4.292307692307692
2683791,5,B000K7VHKA,"This video was a great story as all Strawberry episodes. Graphics were very detail and made it so enjoyable to watch, almost like a movie. Great music, a real pleaser for the granddaughter.
Highly recommend to the Strawberry Shortcake lover!",1266796800,,241,5.05
2683792,1,B000K7VHKA,"My 3 year-old and 5 year-old just watched this movie and it terrified them!  I never expected them to be so scared of a Strawberry Shortcake video.  When I was young the Purple Pieman just wanted berries for his pies.  Here he's out to steal everyone's dreams!  Now my kids are going to have nightmares about some mean guy trying to steal their dreams while they're asleep.

Aside from the scary parts, the plot just rambled.  It seemed like they were constantly adding ideas - in a very disjointed manner - to fill up air time.  The story was weak and did not appeal to my children.  They actually asked me to get rid of the DVD after it was over.

Why do some children's shows seem to feel the need to have a ""bad"" person in them?  Can't writers be a little creative and come up with stories that don't include evil characters?  Maybe an older set of kids would enjoy this movie, but it's definitely not suitable for younger audiences.  Blue's Clue's, Winnie the Pooh, and Backyardigans are all children's shows that have been able to write interesting and creative story lines that model how to overcome adversity without including gratuitous evil characters.  We'll be sticking with them instead of Strawberry Shortcake.",1254614400,2,1224,4.663551401869159
2683793,2,B000K7VHKA,"I am disappointed with this Strawberry Shortcake movie.  I like the traditional animation used in the other Strawberry Shortcake DVDs much better than the computer animation (""CGI"") used in ""the Sweet Dreams Movie"".  There are some good songs, and my daughter requests this movie, however, it's too long and the story doesn't keep her attention for the entire movie.",1241913600,,366,5.186440677966102
2683794,5,B000K7VHKA,"I'm not sure why everyone is making a fuss of the format? My kids like cartoons, in all formats...and I like 'safe' cartoons where the 'villan' isn't too scary...like some Disney movies (those villians are often too scary) sooo IMHO, this is a great DVD and I give it a thumbs up...very sweet and cute! :) BOTH my son & daughter liked it.",1238198400,,338,4.380952380952381
2683795,5,B000K7VHKA,My twin girls received this movie on their 1st birthday and love it.  They watch it everyday.  They get excited every-time I turn the movie on or they hear the music.  I grew up watching and loving Strawberry Shortcake and it brings back a lot of memories.  I WOULD recommend this for any little girl.,1207526400,,301,4.418181818181818
2683796,1,B000K7VHKA,"This didn't go over well with the wee ones in my home at all. The older Strawberry Shortcake stories had an innocent charm that was completely lacking here. The whole thing seemed crass and the story didn't have enough ideas to sustain it through feature length. When the kids walk away before the show's over, it's a bad sign.",1189382400,4,327,4.559322033898305

2683799,3,B000K7VHKA,"Wow, after watching this, I'm disappointed!  The usually super-cute gang has been annimated into a funky, scary bunch in an attempt to make them seem, well, more life-like.  imho, They look fugly! Although the story itself is  cute, there are much better choices out there in Starwberry land.  Click over to the recent Berry Fairy Tales or Moonlight Mysteries (steer clear of this plot if you have really young ones).",1176768000,3,417,4.914285714285715
2683800,3,B000K7VHKA,"Even though 3D animation doesn't suit Strawberry, I hate the way they 'updated' SSC and her friends outfits, and they seemed to have forgotten all about Huckleberry Pie, this movie was not as bad as I thought it would be.

As a baby of the 80's  I grew up with the series of cartoons SSC had back then, and they always were lighter than even My Little Pony or Care Bears in terms of story. Alot of that feeling is in this movie, only the depressing parts in 'Silly Dreamer' do seem a little dark for Strawberry Land...

It is so nice to see the Purple Pieman and Sour Grapes back again (they were the old series villains), though it seems a bit odd the writers made them brother and sister and replaced Sour Grapes snake pet with a horse named Dobbin wearing a bakers hat :P.

All and all it is a good movie though, much better than the newer My Little Pony cartoons. I wonder why they waited so long to make this when the whole style of the SSC dolls is being changed yet again by another company?",1175817600,,998,4.209424083769633
2683801,4,B000K7VHKA,"Cute movie. It's nice to see the love for Strawberry Shortcake and friends being passed on to a new generation. My two year-old and five year-old love the songs and we find ourselves singing them throughout the day. I wonder why they changed Raspberry Tart to Torte? Has Sour Grapes always been Pieman's sister? Hrmm..

My biggest peeve about the movie is that ""ing"" does not seem to be in the voice actors' vocabularies. (""Mornin' Comin' Shinin"") Also, too many ""gottas"" as opposed to ""haftas""...just a slight peeve of mine. Haha. I loved the computer animation very much so. Sour Grapes looks like Renee Zellweger, hahaha.",1175126400,3,624,4.886792452830188

8154784,4,B000K7VHKA,This movie was on Netflix for a hot second and then disappeared and after having seen it once my daughter repeatedly asked for it for her birthday.  Like all kids movies from this time period it can be a little bit jarring to those of us who are used to modern kids programs.  For all of that though it's a sweet movie about a beloved character.  And it makes my daughter happy.,1483574400,,378,4.222222222222222
