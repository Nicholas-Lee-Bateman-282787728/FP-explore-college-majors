2006296,4,B0001K2L4W,"The year is 1665, and 17-year-old Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is forced out into the job market in Delft, Holland, after an accident at her father's pottery studio leaves him blind and unable to support the family. After little searching, she is employed as a common maid in the household of Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), a master painter. Although Vermeer posesses impeccable talent, his painstakingly slow process for his art strains on his family of ten children (soon to be eleven) and haughty wife Catharina (Essie Davis), who are dependent on his meager salary. Although they teeter on the edge of poverty, they continue to mantain their lavish lifestyle under the roof of Catharina's mother, Maria (Judy Parfitt). Griet is subsequently thrown into this caustic mix, and soon attracts the attention of the reclusive painter, who struggles to find a subject for his next work. Her notice of detail, color, shadow, and her ability to see beyond the paint and challenge him quickly makes her the object of Vermeer's inspiration and obsession. Vermeer's patron, Master van Ruijvin (Tom Wilkinson), who notices their relationship, proposes for Vermeer to paint a portrait of Griet, and with the green light from Maria, the two carry on under Catharina's nose in the secretive attic studio. Along with the attention from Vermeer and van Ruijven, Griet is also noticed by Pieter (Cillian Murphy), a butcher's son, and much drama ensues, culminating in one of the greatest, and most mysterious paintings ever created.
In terms of acting, ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" certainly showcases Scarlett Johansson, one of today's most promising young stars, as the innocent and intelligent Griet. Painfully beautiful, her luminosity shines near through the film, and her lines, while few, are full of realistic feeling and emotion. Colin Firth does a fine job as the restrained Vermeer, and his brooding eyes, slighted speech, and slower movements truly capture the character. As a supporting cast, Tom Wilkinson is irresistably slimy, Essie Davis shines in her role as Vermeer's bitter wife, and Alakina Mann, who made her debut in 2001's ""The Others"" is amazing as Cornelia, Vermeer's oldest daughter, who tortures Griet.
The thing that intrigues me about this film was the script. With nearly no dialogue, it shows how a look, movement, or sound can convey an entire mood or give the plot direction. Characters are succesfully developed, conflict is raised, and resolution is searched for, all with minimal words, which, in my opinion, is exactly the technique needed for this movie.
Overall, this is truly one of the most beautiful films of the year, with not only the script, but in particular the sets cinematography. The dark, bustling streets of 17th century Holland are amazingly shot, and the camera captures light, movement, and use of shadow so perfectly, it almost rivals one of Vermeer's paintings. It transitions from spring to summer to the swirling snows of wintertime seamlessly, which does nothing but add to the splendor onscreen. The acting is superb, the cinematography jaw-dropping, and the script a lasting tribute to the mystery behind Vermeer's canvas.",1074729600,3,3168,5.189453125
2006297,5,B0001K2L4W,"I just saw ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" this afternoon. I was thoroughly entertained with the fictional story of behind Vermeer's painting of a young girl with a pear earring. Normally I am not really big on period pieces but I was completely engrossed through out the film. It makes up for the shoddy film ""Carnage"" I saw last weekend. ""Girl With Pearl Earring"" stars Scarlett Johansson (my favorite actress at the moment) as Griet, the object of Johanne Vermeer's (Colin Firth) painting. I haven't read the novel written by Tracy Chevalier but now that I have seen the film, I have this compelling urge to read the book now. Anyways, Griet is a young peasant girl who is forced to make a living for her family because her father was maimed in a serious accident as a tile maker. She is sent to work as a maid for the Vermeer household. Colin Firth looked absolutely gorgeous as Johanne Vermeer despite the grungey look he had going in the movie. Like Johansson, Firth put in a stellar performance as Vermeer. The supporting cast of Tom Wilkinson as master patron Van Ruijven, Judy Parfitt as Maria Thins, Jo Scanlan as Tanneke (the other maid), Cillian Murphy (Griet's boyfriend), and Essie Davis as the insecure and control freak wife Catherina were equally compelling to say the very least. I loved the sinister daughter Cornelia (played by Alakina Mann). Although she didn't say much in the movie, her actions spoke louder than words. One couldn't help but feel pity for Vermeer who appeared to be emotionally beaten down by his insecure wife Catherina. Perhaps that is how Peter Webb intended for Vermeer. The cinematography by Eduardo Serra was excellent. The dark, moody cinematography fit the mood of the film. The costumes and the entire set of the film was equally wonderful. I guess if there was a flaw with the film is the minimal dialogue but I wasn't really bothered by that. It enhanced the mood of the film in my opinion. I loved ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"". It is another reason to love Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.",1074384000,11,2039,4.714285714285714
2006298,5,B0001K2L4W,"In Delft, Holland, 1665, a young peasant woman named Griet (Scarlett Johansson) goes to work as a maid in the home of the painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). Although she cannot read or write, Griet's appreciation of color, light and composition stirs Vermeer from his isolation and brooding disposition, and Griet's face and daily chores become subjects of his paintings. As Griet and Vermeer's attraction to one another becomes obvious, his wife Catharina (Essie Davis) and mother-in-law (Judy Parfitt) develop strong but disparate opinions of Griet's place in the household.
Little is known about the painter Johannes Vermeer, and nothing is known about the young woman who is the subject of his portrait ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"". But the inscrutable expression on her face inspired author Tracy Chevalier to write a fictional account of how the painting came to be. ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is based on Chevalier's novel of the same name. It has been adapted for the screen by Olivia Hetreed and directed by Peter Webber. It's pure historical fiction.
This is a beautiful, quiet film about love, jealousy, and life's realities. The story is small; it concerns the emotions of the people in one household. Not much actually ""happens"" in the concrete sense. The story's events and its arc are primarily emotional. There is relatively little dialogue, and Griet, being a domestic servant, speaks even less than the other characters. Scarlett Johansson is left to convey her feelings with facial expressions. Sometimes this works better than others. There are moments in this film where Johansson seems to be trying too hard. It's not terrible, but it could be better. On the other hand, when Griet speaks, Johansson is spot-on. The supporting performances are all exceptional. Essie Davis effectively evokes the audience's antipathy as Vermeer's insecure and demanding wife. Judy Parfitt steals every scene she is in as the imposing, pragmatic head of household. Tom Wilkinson is simultaneously aristocratic and sleazy as Vermeer's wealthy patron Van Ruijven. And Colin Firth reveals the passion, intelligence, and frustration that  seethes just below the fictional Vermeer's surface. Even as these performances are a pleasure to watch, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring""'s cinematography and production design are moreso. Eduardo Serra's beautiful cinematography within the closed spaces of the Vermeer household is simply the best of 2003. Ben van Os' production design, with art direction from Christina Schaffer, bathes this film in the subdued yet crisp colors of Vermeer's paintings and brings this household to life with details that seem so real that I wished I could touch them.
""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is a story of personal proportions. Yet its quiet beauty and fine performances make every frame a pleasure to watch. Highly recommended.",1074038400,4,2856,5.276923076923077
2006299,5,B0001K2L4W,"GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING was a dazzling novel by Tracy Chevalier, an achievement so stunning that artists, art historians, art lovers and readers all willingly sacrificed historic accuracy for the illuminating insight on how a painting comes into being.  Now Peter Webber with the help of his screenwriters has enhanced the novel and made visual all the magic the book contained and more.  The story is so well known by now that rehashing the plot seems pointless. This is simply a take on how Vermeer created a mysteriously beautiful portrait of a young girl in his studio, a painting that though small, holds all of the magic of light source, absorption, and reflection that became the hallmark of the great Dutch master painter.  Though the story is minimal it is the cinematography/picture composition that is the main feature here.  Care is given to the exteriors of Delft (as staged in Luxembourg) to be cold and misty, making the interior shots all the more claustrophobic and intimate and lighted only by candle or by the limited light from leaded glass windows.  This is a movie that would be thoroughly understood even if the soundtrack were lost.  But that is not giving importance to the actors who people this painting come to life.  Colin Firth as Vermeer says little with his lips but says vistas with his eyes: this is a sensitive understated performance.  The wearer of the earring is Scarlett Johansson as Griet and she brings to her role a physical beauty of face and presence that make this version of how Vermeer created his 28 masterpieces believable. As a maid in Vermeer's house she is under the scrutiny of Vermeer's ever-pregnant wife (an excellent Essie Davis) and even more controlled by the presence of Vermeer's mother-in-law - the wondrous Judy Parfitt who is so elegant in her Elizabethan type white collar over her black gowns that she begs to be a painting Vermeer never did!  Tom Wilkinson adds credence to Vermeer's patron and Cillian Murphy receives all the benefits of Griet's coming into the knowledge of ecstasy as her butcher boyfriend, a lad with penetrating blue eyes and brusque charm.  The musical score is most fitting (Alexandre Desplat).  This is a treat of the eyes and the mind and sure to become a staple in the libraries of all who love art.",1073865600,6,2294,4.811704834605598
2006300,5,B0001K2L4W,"If you liked the novel you are going to love this movie. I personally didn't see how they were going to make an interesting movie out of the book, even though I liked the book. But I was so very wrong! I was amazed by this film--quietly soulful and surprisingly powerful. The screenwriter director, art designer, and everyone else involved did a first rate job and you can really sense that it was a labor of love. The ending is subtle and amazing. Art lovers, especially, are going to be blown away by this movie.",1073260800,5,514,4.421052631578948
2006301,4,B0001K2L4W,"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is a work of art both thematically and literally. This movie is one of the most beautifully photographed and lit that I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot of movies!) In addition, the performances are subtle, nuanced and ultimately overwhelming.
The movie takes place in mid-17th century Holland. Griet, a 15-year old girl from a proud but recently impoverished family, takes a job as a maid with the family of Johannes Vermeer, the painter.
The family has a well-defined cast of characters: Johannes(or Jan) played by a smoldering Colin Firth, whose art takes precedence over anything in his life, including food and heat for his family; his beautiful but silly wife who lives for her jewels; his many children; and his mother-in-law/sales agent, who will do anything to keep selling his paintings. The Vermeer family depends on the good graces of their patron, played by a wicked Tom Wilkinson, who commissions and collects Jan's paintings.
Griet has an artist's eye-for example, she is concerned about dusting the windows and changing the light-and slowly, very slowly, Vermeer begins to appreciate her gifts. His patron notices her beauty and commissions a painting of her (with the hope that Griet will thank him in kind). The interplay between Griet (an outstanding Scarlett Johansson) and Vermeer simmers with erotic tension. Nothing much happens-their hands briefly touch, they are beneath a blanket together-but then again a lot happens.
I would recommend this movie to lovers of art and lovers of art house movies. If you're not used to or a fan of ""artsy movies"", well this may not be for you. But if you are, well you're in for a treat.",1071532800,19,1679,4.915492957746479
2006302,4,B0001K2L4W,"I have become obsessed with Scarlett Johansson. After seeing her in Ghost World and then years later in Lost in Translation, I have fallen in love with her classic beauty and superb acting. So let me put it out there - I saw this movie to see Scarlett.
As an artist, I found the film to be intriguing. Almost every scene, like a Vermeer, had perfect light, wonderful color, and fantastic composition. The cinematography is breathtaking. But also, as the characters prance around in an utterly perfect atmosphere, it is hard to miss the superb acting of the cast as a whole, especially by the females. Griet (Johannson), her mistress, and her misstress' mother are all played with quiet conviction and simulatenous compassion. While each character holds in place, none, even the young daughter, is without multiple dimensions and vast emotion.
That said, the film had a feel for a made-for-TV movie. The plot was subtle yes. But much happened - maybe too much.  Meanwhile, there were parts of the film that drove me insane (why was the sky high noon blue when the light in the room was that of early evening?), but it did manage to keep me calmly entertained. The ending lacked strength, but when Scarlett puts on the cloth, the earring, and turns her head behind her shoulder to reveal the ""perfect"" pose, chills ran down my spine for 5 minutes straight. And for that alone, the film deserves at least 4 stars.",1070496000,12,1410,4.708502024291498
2006303,5,B0001K2L4W,"Hanging in the Royal Cabinet of Paintings in The Hague is a 17 1/2 by 15 3/8 inch oil on canvas by Johannes Vermeer, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"". Perhaps you've seen it, either the original or a reproduction.  Against a dark background, it depicts a young girl, wearing a blue turban from which falls a yellow scarf, gazing over her left shoulder towards the viewer. From her visible ear dangles a large, tear-drop shaped, pearl earring. The painting is exquisite.
There are a couple of questions still surrounding the work. Are the pearls real? Who was the model? Vermeer's oldest daughter, Maria? Or perhaps Magdalena, the daughter of Vermeer's principal patron, Pieter Van Ruijven?
GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, a film based on the novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, does something I've not seen done before, and which would enhance art appreciation considerably if a series of such productions were made focusing on publicly recognizable works of art, e.g. the ""Mona Lisa"" and her enigmatic smile. The film creates a fictional story around the genesis of the painting, and we watch as the artist creates it.
It's the Dutch city of Delft in 1665. A young girl, Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is employed as a common maid by Catharina (Essie Davis), the artist's haughty wife. At first, the viewer might be forgiven for being led to believe that the household is run by a matriarchy, Johannes (Colin Firth) himself being reclusive. Apparently presiding over everything is Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), Catharina's severely parsimonious mother. Providing tension from a lower level is Cornelia, the artist's 6-year old daughter, who resents Griet from the very start.
Assigned to clean Vermeer's studio, Griet becomes enthralled by the work in progress. Noticing this, the artist emerges into the audience's view, and involves Griet in the mechanics of his art's creation, especially the selection and purchase of coloring materials, and the preparation of the oils. Griet fills a void in the artist's life. His wife doesn't ""understand"" his art, and, indeed, hasn't even set foot in his studio since some past quarrel. Johannes becomes (platonically) obsessed with Griet, and, unknown to Catharina, the girl fearfully becomes, perhaps realizing the potential repercussions, his model.
Johansson's performance is brilliant and worth an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Colin Firth, whose taciturnity and stone-facedness in his roles I usually find unappealing, is perfect as Vermeer. His smoldering passion for art and Griet, along with the other subsurface family tensions, keeps the viewer waiting for something to explode. Parfitt is terrific as the intimidating Maria Thins, who sees what's happening between her son-in-law and the maid, but says nothing to her daughter. Maria knows on which side the family's bread is buttered, and realizes that without the income generated by Vermeer's oils, the household would be thrown into the street.
A somewhat discordant note is the character of Van Ruijven, well-played by Tom Wilkinson. His growing lust for Griet becomes a distraction best left on the cutting room floor. However, his character is necessary to the story for the audience to understand an artist's financial precariousness.
Finally, the pearl earrings take center stage when the explosive confrontation between Johannes and Catharina finally occurs, and the latter's term for her husband's latest work is indeed curious. The audience is reminded of the symbolic power of material things.
GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING will not likely make it out of the art houses into wide release. But it's a clever and beautiful film that grows on me the more I think about it. If you've ever stood entranced in front of a painting, go see this movie.",1070409600,173,3750,5.157635467980295
2006314,2,B0001K2L4W,"Goofy.
An entire movie, speculating about a painting.

It IS a Masterpiece, for a number of reasons, but it's not exclusively worthy of an entire film, nor is it a romance, as depicted by the cover.
This is the kind of movie that hoity-toity film hipsters would love to dig into, and derive all kinds of meaning from that isn't really there.

The environment of the production was actually very despairing.
It made the whole experience more and more unenjoyable.

There is very little speaking in the movie, as a whole, and for some reason, some people think that makes a great movie, when you have to sit around trying to guess at the allusions of pretentious hipster writers.

2006366,5,B0001K2L4W,"Visually stunning. Carefully selected frames are Vermeer-like paintings in breathtaking cinematic clarity; which ironically is a contradiction in terms, since his technique and overall preferences of subject matter was the very antithesis of that which was the hallmark of the younger Rembrandt.

The plot is a convenient platform to provide a glimpse into the life of the celebrated artist and offers a glimpse of The Netherlands in it's renaissance.
While the details of his family life are most likely exaggerated contrivances; although the depictions are well done, we also examine the often difficult relationship between artist and patron which still exists to this day.

The very gifted Colin Firth provides us with a deliberately paced study of Vermeer's alleged character and mannerisms; this subtle performance is convincing as it is intriguing in terms of providing a highly subjective insight into the nature of the artist himself.

Scarlett Johansson is Firth's equal in her performance both as Vermeer's household servant and muse.

The supporting actors are more than satisfying backdrops for this semi melodramatic story and play off very well against the evolving story of Vermeer's relationship with Griet; yet they manage not to detract from the most important aspects of the film.

All the technical aspects are an exercise in realized perfection and the production values are balanced to perfection with an impressive attention to detailed authenticity without the burden of excess; which Vermeer himself would have approved of.",1489708800,6,1549,5.464435146443515

2006368,5,B0001K2L4W,"A wonderful story, highly romanticized, about one of the greatest artists of the Dutch Golden Age.  Scarlett Johannsson's portrayal of the young servant girls is near perfect - in fact when you look at Vermeer's portrayal of such women (The Milkmaid for example), she is as much that subject in his painting as she is the Girl with the Pearl Earring. Vermeer was exceptionally kind and respectful to women in his paintings, given his era.  Yes, he has one of a brothel scene, and he has three others that imply the seduction of a servant girl, but it is possible (as hinted in this movie) that he painted those themes to please the sponsor of a painting.  Vermeer painted at least 35 paintings - women appeared in 33 of them, and appeared as the sole subjects in 28 of them.  No other painter of his era, in  France, Italy, Austria, - anywhere - painted more than 30% of their sole subjects as women. And so many of his paintings show women in quiet, reflective moments - indicating a respect for their private thoughts and concerns.  The growing sexual awareness of the maid Greit (Johannson) in this movie parallels the sexual tension between the pretty young servant girl and her master.  It does make a great movie plot, but in all of my studies of Vermeer and his paintings - consummation is unlikely to have occurred, and she was not likely the model for his most famous painting.  The most likely model for  this painting was his precocious thirteen year old daughter. I respect the movie greatly  because they did not allow either character to sink into a tawdry sexual desire.  The young maid was flattered to be painted, and wanted so much to be the object of her master's brush.  Vermeer, seems in the end, in his unwillingness to support her - to have gotten what he wanted.  The perfect model for a masterpiece.  I loved this movie - I like sex scenes in movies - but that this director left it out is one of the strongest reasons for this being a great movie.",1488499200,2,1973,4.52112676056338

A review by Anthony T. Riggio of the book The Girl with a Pearl Earring:

This book was recommended to me by a friend/author, namely Chris Manion, and I believe it was recommended because of the superb writing style of the author Tracy Chevalier. I really had no great interest in reading this book but I am so glad I did.
Several years ago, I saw this painting in the National Museum in Washington DC as part of a Vermeer exhibit. It had a striking effect on me and made me want to know what this young girl was she thinking. The girl's visage was as enigmatic, to me as the Mona Lisa by DaVinci. The painting, like this delightful book, drew me in to its mystery. I also was taken by Vermeer's style and use of colors and knew that he painted in the mid-17th century in Holland and because I am married to an artist, I understood the difficulties that artists had in using and making colors for their works of Art.
This book, albeit a work of fiction, pulls the reader into the culture of 17th century Holland and allows the reader to be immersed in the daily life of two families and the struggles experienced in the timeless arena of class struggle.
The heroine, Griet, is forced by economic circumstances, to work as a maid at age 16, in the Vermeer household.  She has a keen mind and Vermeer recognized this and the mistress of the house, sensed immediately the competition that developed for the attention of the master, Vermeer.
Vermeer is pulled into his ""attraction"" for Greit because of her almost OCD attention to detail and instinctive artistic talents, something Vermeer demanded and could not get from anyone in his household.  While there are no tawdry interactions between the two, you easily sense the ""attraction"" from the perspective of a young and impressionable young girl.  Predictably, there are immediate and lasting tensions by Griet's employment.
This is a tale of desire for love and love of art and the reader is not disappointed as he/she is pulled into this drama of life which really has no restrictions to time and period but the reader will get a good glimpse of life during this period.
The author, Tracy Chevalier, is a ""word smith"" par excellence and deserves great accolades for this short work.  I recommend this book to all readers of fiction and nonfiction.
I unhesitatingly give this book a five stars rating.",1466985600,,2366,4.623809523809523
2006467,4,B0001K2L4W,Rented this the night that I first saw the painting in person.  It is a really amazing painting - Vermeer was a master of light and color and the movie was shot in a way that reflected this.  This movie made me want to learn more about him.  Scarlett Johansen looked amazingly like the girl in the painting.,1466899200,,307,4.258620689655173

2006483,5,B0001K2L4W,"I missed this film when it was first released but am certainly glad I discovered it recently and, so far, have watched it four times.  Though it is fiction, it could have really happened much like the story. Though the ending is slightly different than the book it was done effectively.  Scarlett Johansson was a spitting image of the portrait by Johannes Vermeer; I doubt anyone else could have been made up to come close to her portrayal of the maid who, in 1665,  takes the job at the Vermeer residence in Delft, Holland. In time their is a chemistry between her and the 33 year old artist; she becomes his muse. The scenery was stunning, the acting very well done. Colin Firth, as always, turns out a terrific performance.
This movie touched me so much that I had to purchase a canvas of Girl With A Pearl Earring. I have become a a lover of Vermeer paintings because of this lovely movie. Roger Ebert had given it a thumbs up when he wrote that it was done with taste and elegance.",1465344000,8,986,4.406593406593407

2006598,3,B0001K2L4W,"Loved the book, tolerated the movie which wasn't close enough (especially the ending) to the ""intriguing and highly seductive story"" so masterfully created by Tracy Chevalier in her historical fiction book. Not the best role for my boyfriend Colin Firth who played the too aloof and strangely obscure Vermeer but unfortunately without much chemistry with Scarlett Johannson.  Both actors do a good enough job with a script that seldom has them speaking more than 5 words in a row. Without gripping dialogue, the glances and looks and innuendoes just aren't enough when there isn't much chemistry between the actors.  The best actors for their believable characters by far was Vermeer's wife played by Essie Davis and Vermeer's mother-in-law played by Judy Parfitt.  Read the book, then watch the movie if you must.  The sets alone are worth 1 hr and 41 minutes.",1439510400,,861,5.042253521126761
2006599,5,B0001K2L4W,"Unless some significant historical facts come forward to pour light onto the obscure life of Vermeer, this luxuriant film is not likely to ever be surpassed.  Every scene recalls a painting of the master himself, or at least the style.  The script and acting recall this mysterious and somber age which, for some reason, history has left enclouded.  A gentle and original score by Alexandre Desplat completes this simply brilliant cinema.

Some have complained it moves too slow, but I write this off to those unfortunates who must constantly be doing something every moment of their lives.  They cannot just sit on a bench in a park and enjoy the sights and sounds; no, they gulp their wine and swallow chocolate whole.  This film best satisfies those who savour every moment with all their senses, who can feel and smell the starched linen, and the soap in the copper kettle, and the sun splashing on the wall.

Interesting fictional history premise, that Vermeer's subject of Pearl Earring was an object of desire and a distraction from an unhappy marriage. Well played.
What it lacks is relief from all the long-suffering, mopey, unhappiness from every single character, not one iota of good humor breathes inside anyone in the Vermeer household. I can't buy that this painter of lovely women and materials would be so sour of temperament.  Even the slightest bit of warmth would have depicted a more rounded view of the era/milieu that informed this very humanistic artists's work. Why only the plodding melodrama throughout?

2006640,3,B0001K2L4W,"This slow moving film is a fictional account of how Vermeer's painting ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" was created. Don't expect a bio pic. Instead it is a visual feast of culture and history. I loved that bit as you don't see much set in 17th century Holland. That's actually the highlight of it. There isn't much to the story. The making of the picture is pretty straight forward. There isn't a lot going on with relationships- there are dynamic SCENES, but there is little depth to any real interaction. You don't get into anyone's soul. You don't get a real understanding of who they are. They are just moving through lovely backdrops while thinking or feeling, yet not in any interactive way (most of the time).

So, it's pretty. It's artsy. The acting is well done. The writing is well done. The sets and costumes are great. I love the time period. It's just lacking a bit more glue to hold it all together and make me care- particularly because the ending is unsatisfying.",1424304000,3,975,4.571428571428571

2006655,4,B0001K2L4W,"Girl with a Pearl Earring is a drama based on the novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier. It is named after a painting of the same name by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer and uses a bright color scheme as in Vermeer's paintings.

The story is told from the point of view of Griet, a teen-aged girl who leaves her family's care in the country to become a servant for the Vermeer household in the comparatively bustling, canal-laden burgh of Delft. When she arrives, she finds herself at the low end of the servant totem pole, until she's allowed to clean the painting quarters. There, she catches the eye of the taciturn, reclusive Vermeer, and over a period of time, he begins to craft her portrait. Of course, this does little to further his relationship with his jealous, pregnant wife, Catharina or with his most vocal benefactor, van Ruijven, who often dictates what portraits Vermeer should paint. Meanwhile, Griet navigates a sweet, tentative relationship with a peasant boy her age.

The film is an intriguing speculative account of the creation of one of Vermeer's most famous and sensual paintings. Every shot in the film looks like it was taken right out of a painting from Delft, Holland during 1665. Also, it was a rare and elegant movie that was bathed in the kind of soft, delicate light that can build unexpectedly to feelings of both anxiety and bliss. Too bad that it lacked energy when the story was told that is why I did not give it the highest score considering that it was a movie of few words and beautiful pictures, and the story is as understated as the acting especially that of Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson. But nevertheless,it is a terrific film.",1419292800,,1686,4.673400673400673

2006693,4,B0001K2L4W,"GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is a relatively uneventful historical drama about Griet, the 17-year-old maid, nicely played by Scarlett Johansson, for painter Johannes Vermeer and his family. At the prodding of Van Ruijven, Vermeer's wealthy, imperious, dirty old man patron, she winds up becoming the model for the famous painting in the title of this film; however, it's supposed to be kept a secret from Vermeer's equally imperious wife. . .Meanwhile, Griet is being courted by Pieter the butcher's apprentice, a strong and likeable character who, although the accent sounds more British than Dutch, is memorably played by Cillian Murphy.

GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING reveals the personal politics and entanglements between its characters very, very well. The situations shown here are the sort that people of all ages and eras go through all the time. It may be too slow-moving for those who want action, dramatic twists, etc, and I would have liked a little more punch somewhere. Still, it has a quiet, subtle tension that's just all its own, and I had no trouble staying with it. By necessity, the scenery is confined almost entirely to the Vermeer household, with some street scenes of Delft, Holland, 1665, and it captures these settings pretty admirably. From what I understand, no one is certain of who the model was for this painting, but most experts think it probably was a servant girl such as Griet. This film is certainly worth seeing for anyone with a basic interest in the history behind the story, and there is also a lot of interesting stuff about the artistic processes of the Old Dutch Masters.

GPE is a realistic but clean film: No nasty stuff besides a quickly aborted, half-hearted rape attempt; also, with some prodding by Vermeer, Griet goes so far as to (gulp!) briefly remove her bonnet for him. No seriously disturbing gore or violence. Still, most younger audiences would probably be quite bored by this film.

GPE is based on a 1999 novel by Tracy Chevalier, which I am now eager to read. While I have no regrets about investing 100 minutes watching it, it seems like the sort of story that can only be done justice when it's read.",1399939200,,2157,4.824324324324325
2006704,5,B0001K2L4W,"Wow. This 100-minute film, nominated for three Oscars and two Golden Globes in 2003, is one of the most exquisitely lensed art house movies I've ever seen. Every frame looks like a masterpiece come to life, full of vivid colors and extraordinary imagery. The music is also excellent, adding to the mystery of a painting (the titular ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"") that has come to rival the Mona Lisa in its powerful mystique. Set in 1660s Holland, the film is based on an historical novel speculating about the origins of this work by Johannes Vermeer.

Despite the racy-looking cover art, the movie is not a sexualized or romantic tale, and there are no intense or naughty scenes. Rather, very much in the style of Martin Scorcese's ""The Age of Innocence,"" one must infer the true emotions and thoughts of this film's characters from a series of masterfully staged interactions. Colin Firth, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy make up the excellent cast.

The story is simple. In a Venice-style city of Holland, a girl from a financially strapped Protestant family goes to work as a maid for the household of Catholic painter Johannes Vermeer. The girl -- named Griet -- becomes the pawn in the ongoing business arrangements between Vermeer's patron and mother-in-law, who manages the household. Vermeer's insecure wife and vindictive daughter, a local butcher in love with Griet, and various other servants play a role in this Downtown Abbey-style household. After Vermeer discovers a soulmate in Griet, she begins mixing his paints for him and eventually poses for the titular painting of this film, to the consternation of Vermeer's artistically tone-deaf spouse. But the journey here is far more intriguing than the destination, as we slowly become immersed in the mysterious interactions of this carefully maintained family.

As a film on the passions and creative process behind great works of art, this movie is one of my favorites alongside ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"" (1965) with Charlton Heston and Rex Harrison. Unlike that other film, this one tells its story more through visuals than through dialogue, inviting the viewer to see things through the eyes of an artist rather than through the lens of a historical biographer. It's a brilliant, moving, and historically rich (17th century Holland really feels like a real place here) human drama. Those who find great art boring may also find this film a bit dull and slow-moving, as it's definitely not the painter's equivalent of ""Amadeus,"" but those who appreciate the dynamics of human relationships and their impact on art will love it. I highly recommend it. Even if you don't like art house films, give this one a shot and see if you like it.",1399680000,3,2727,4.989010989010989

2006762,4,B0001K2L4W,"Long ago, I lived in Amsterdam, and one of the things I recall so vividly--besides the icy October wind--was the cool intensity of the light that shimmered from the reflections of the canals, and it is the play of light and shadow that Johannes Vermeer captured in his paintings in the Netherlands' city of Delft.

Although ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" based on a novel that imagines the artist's inspiration for his eponymous masterpiece, is minimalist in its approach to narrative, its cinematography, which cannot be faulted, puts the viewer in the centre of a Vermeer painting. It is certainly worth viewing for anyone who is interested in art history, or life in seventeenth-century Netherlands, as viewed in one of Vermeer's paintings. The contrast between the cool blue tinges of the servants' quarters and the warm shades of the household, with its Turkish carpeted table coverings, wood-panelled and whitewashed walls, is startling.

Some of the most interesting scenes show the artist cutting and mixing his pigments; they also demonstrate (but do not explain) his reliance on the camera obscura--the box with a lens that reflected the images that he painted and which is said to have emphasised contrast between light and shadow.

The acting is underplayed (Colin Firth at his broodiest; and Scarlett Johansson as the mute victim of class and society) to such an extent that some viewers might find it on the soporific side, especially given the lack of attention to plot or development of character, but the magnificence of the visual details more than compensates.

The portrayals of Vermeer and Greit are subtle, uncluttered with much dialogue...one look from either of those characters is a novel in itself. Hollywood with its excesses (obsession with showing skin, dialogues full of overt profanity) is exposed as totally unsubtle and artless by this smoldering, understated masterpiece.  By leaving a great deal to the imagination, this film entertains and tantalizes beyond belief.

2006821,5,B0001K2L4W,"GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING was a dazzling novel by Tracy Chevalier, an achievement so stunning that artists, art historians, art lovers and readers all willingly sacrificed historic accuracy for the illuminating insight on how a painting comes into being. Now Peter Webber with the help of his screenwriters has enhanced the novel and made visual all the magic the book contained and more. The story is so well known by now that rehashing the plot seems pointless. This is simply a take on how Vermeer created a mysteriously beautiful portrait of a young girl in his studio, a painting that though small, holds all of the magic of light source, absorption, and reflection that became the hallmark of the great Dutch master painter. Though the story is minimal it is the cinematography/picture composition that is the main feature here. Care is given to the exteriors of Delft (as staged in Luxembourg) to be cold and misty, making the interior shots all the more claustrophobic and intimate and lighted only by candle or by the limited light from leaded glass windows. This is a movie that would be thoroughly understood even if the soundtrack were lost. But that is not giving importance to the actors who people this painting come to life. Colin Firth as Vermeer says little with his lips but says vistas with his eyes: this is a sensitive understated performance. The wearer of the earring is Scarlett Johansson as Griet and she brings to her role a physical beauty of face and presence that make this version of how Vermeer created his 28 masterpieces believable. As a maid in Vermeer's house she is under the scrutiny of Vermeer's ever-pregnant wife (an excellent Essie Davis) and even more controlled by the presence of Vermeer's mother-in-law - the wondrous Judy Parfitt who is so elegant in her Elizabethan type white collar over her black gowns that she begs to be a painting Vermeer never did! Tom Wilkinson adds credence to Vermeer's patron and Cillian Murphy receives all the benefits of Griet's coming into the knowledge of ecstasy as her butcher boyfriend, a lad with penetrating blue eyes and brusque charm. The musical score is most fitting (Alexandre Desplat). This is a treat of the eyes and the mind and sure to become a staple in the libraries of all who love art.

In a world where blatant sexuality is nonexistent, entire conversations compose of significant looks and Scarlett Johansson's hair is seen for only 30 seconds, Griet (Johansson) must survive in the Vermeer household as their new maid, trying to remain in the good graces of Vermeer's wife Catherina while dealing with Vermeer's spiteful daughter Cornelia, his lascivious patron and her forbidden attraction to Vermeer himself. Silence and restraint play a powerful role in this movie, where even the gentlest touch becomes highly erotic--you'll see what I mean when you watch it. For the fangirls, Colin Firth is handsome as sin in this movie, and there's tons of--for lack of a more appropriate word--eye sex also. Johansson does a wonderful job as the demure Griet, and Firth's taciturn portrayal of Vermeer does wonders.

What do these different movies have in common? Great soundtracks that enhance the stories. GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING certainly has that. After watching the movie, I purchased the CD and the novel and a book on Vermeer's paintings. While some may think that's backwards, preferring to read the novel first, I don't think that's true in this case. Without revealing the ending of either the movie or the book, I can say that they don't end at the same place; the book tells you what happened to the character years after the movie ends, but this is wrapped up in just a few pages. It is the movie, though, that has the more powerful ending. And once the story on the screen has ended, the music continues as it focuses on the portrait. The feeling I came away with at the end is how art can be created such as a painting, music, or a novel, where the artist is inspired by love, and the model or inspiration for the work of art has no idea how important she is and how she may live forever because of it. The main character in the story was a poor, illiterate maid in Vermeer's household, and she could never have known that over 300 years later, a painting of her would still endure and that it would be viewed by millions of people and be worth millions of dollars.

I like to follow particular actors and I appreciate abilities to play varying roles. Not stereotypes onto same roles all the time.
Girl With A Pearl Earring is also a great tale of how people could be used and abused in those days.
Jealousy against the maid because she had an uncanny understanding of what the part that Colin Firth played -was doing with his art.
I felt like we could have had a lot more of the story. Very good movie Let me close by saying how pleased I was to get this movie in Region 2 WITH SUBTITLES for Hard of Hearing thanks. Compatible with Region 4 here in Australia.",1320192000,,743,4.391304347826087

2006852,5,B0001K2L4W,"2003's ""Girl with a Pearl Earing"" offers a detailed recreation of the Delft, Holland of 1665, and specifically, of the house of gifted painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth).  The house is run by Vermeer's mother-in-law (Judy Parfit), who understands its survival depends on earning commissions from weathly art patrons, including the manipulative Master van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson).  Vermeer has just finished a painting, and is in need of inspiration.

Into the house comes a new young maid, Griet (Scarlett Johansson).  Griet is poor, shy, and illiterate.  She is also hardworking, curious, and, to the surprise of Vermeer, has an instinctive grasp of the essentials of color, light, and composition in painting.  Her assistance to his work draws the jealousy of Vermeer's bitter wife Katrina (Essie Davis), the hatred of one of the children, and the mischief-making of Master van Ruijven, who demands she be the subject of Vermeer's next painting.

Griet's life becomes complicated.  She is an object of courtship for the handsome butcher's boy Pieter (Cillian Murphy), of sensuous inspiration for Vermeer, and of a crude rape attempt by van Ruijven.  A quiet conspiracy to complete the painting without Katrina's knowledge is betrayed, leading to a fateful confrontation over Griet's status in the house.

""Girl with a Pearl Earing"" has a solid cast, outstanding production values, and a subtle but intense plot centering on the young Griet.  As a servant forbidden to speak unless spoken to, Scarlett Johansson's Griet compellingly portrays her moods and emotions through gesture and expression.  Unglamorous in servant's clothing, scrubbed white skin, and work-roughened hands, the innocent act of removing her cap and letting down her long red hair in the presence of Vermeer becomes an unconscious intimacy.  Of such well-crafted moments is made an excellent, highly recommended period movie.",1275264000,2,1901,5.403389830508474

2006854,4,B0001K2L4W,"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" was up for lots of awards, which prompted me to find out what was so special. Indeed, it's a feast for the eyes and ears. Music, costumes, sets and glorious widescreen photography capture so very much of the period. Hyped as about the life of Johannes Vermeer, it's really about Griet (a lovely Scarlett Johanssen) and her role as a servant in Vanmeer's household. In the hands of director Peter Webber, the visuals take precedence to an otherwise mundane story. The acting is impeccable. Scarlett is completely in touch, and excellent performances from Essie Davis (as the wife) and Judy Parfitt (as her mother) are complete and rife with issues. Colin Firth, as Vanmeer, is moody and broody; I was rather annoyed with his character for being such a wimp. Also, excellent support from Tom Wilkinson (snakey, evil charm) and Cillian Murphy (never looked better). The film is never boring, but the plot is simple, ad Griet's angst, charm and renewal are well handled. Still, it'll be hard to find a prettier film to watch. Visually, it's period pitch-perfect and Alexandre Desplat's score is dreamy as a Vermeer painting. Worth a look.",1264118400,,1162,4.903553299492386

2006859,3,B0001K2L4W,"I give this movie 3 stars due to the transcendent beauty of the filming.
I give it only 3 due to the second half of the movie.  I give the first half 5 stars plus!  The problem? It is similar to such movies as ""Immortal Beloved"", the one about Beethoven that has gotten so many rave reviews.  They are both lost opportunities of creating movies about artists, composers which reflect truth.  How much more exciting, interesting and moving would it have been if it had followed what we know of the life of the artist and the creation of the painting...which is not much, but less is more.

In this one, we know little about the life of Vermeer, so what do directors, screenwriters, producers do...they make up salacious sensational soap-opera events to attract the 21st century movie going audience.  What they have done is blasphemous to the integrity and art of Vermeer.  Why couldn't we have had a movie about ONLY the creation of this incredible painting...""The Girl with the Pearl Earring""?  Just the making of the painting, without adding fabricated rapes and domestic marital strife.  It is almost as if the creators of this movie hated Vermeer.
Shame on you.  Shame on those who created the false sensationalism of the Beethoven Immortal Beloved movie too.

If you purchase this movie. Watch only the first half.  The last half is not about art or Vermeer, but about money for filmakers.  Filmakers who have no understanding of what true beauty is, and the spiritual integrity which ensues if you follow truth rather than cheap tawdry fiction.

2006872,5,B0001K2L4W,"I was pleasantly surprised that this period piece fictionalized the ""story behind a painting"" without the typical need for overt sexual involvement. What I mean by that, is that this book-to-film was more about the understanding between house-maid and artist, not a sexual realtionship...... which was a welcome difference in fictional period films about muses and their masters.

It is a quietly developing film, neither tedious nor upbeat. The story of Vermeer stays financially and pictorially correct to history - down to the names, scenery, and the likeness of the characters depcited in his true paintings (which was refreshing). The drama of his financial need to stay afloat, while being supported by his mother inlaw, is historically accurate - as well as his patronige with one affluent buyer, keeping the truth of Vermeer's Dutch local fame true to life as well.

The fictional involvement of Johansson's house-maid character is the meat of the film - but as I said before - I found a serene beauty in her being Vermeer's muse, without either infidelity or even many words being spoken between she and the master painter. It was a fascination on both parts more than a romance. She understood his art; Through his fascination with her she learned/understood light, space and movement, the mixing of pigments and had an appreciation for his art that Vermeer's wife could not compete with or comprehend - causing the main dramas.

The film is subtlely endearing.... some may find it too slow, but I thought the many quiet moments and unspoken thoughts in this film added to artistic appreciation, instead of plot distraction and chaos.  The nasty characters inflict just enough threat to make both painter and maid pitiable in their plight. But overall, you are left with a serenity and sadness for how the painting of the Pearl Earring came about and captivated with the purity of Vermeer's art.",1237507200,,1905,5.018987341772152

2006876,5,B0001K2L4W,"This movie is a great find for any art lover. The entire film offers the beautiful essence of the oil painting by Vermeer.  I'm not saying it is as great as the master's painting; it is however, as sensual and reveals the color quality from the painting.

Griet, the girl in the picture, played by Scarlett Johansson, is masterful in that, even with many moments where she has no dialogue, her expressions and the glances of her eyes tells the story of the painting over and over and over.  She is a goddess-like beauty but at the same time plain as any Delft maid in 1665.  What she does NOT say tells much of the painting's story.

Colin Firth is...well, Colin Firth is top-drawer good and this time not as an Englishman.  He does a perfect job portraying the artist, Vermeer, in love with the picture's composition and subject, NOT the girl herself.

2006879,4,B0001K2L4W,"This beautifully made film is worth seeing for the heavily meditated transmission of 17th century Dutch art to the screen, a stunning achievement.  Delft is wonderfully recreated based on the works of Vermeer and many other painters. The basic story line about a Calvinist girl warily going into a Bohemian artist household is fine, and Scarlett Johanson is very good, as is her butcher's apprentice boyfriend.

The only problem is that this isn't Vermeer -- they should have simply used another name as in ordinary Roman a' clef novels such as The Sun Also Rises.  While we do not have a dense background on Vermeer, we do know enough to say he wasn't a broody British Heathcliff.  Painting wasn't his only gig nor even perhaps his main one -- he traded rugs & paintings & took over his dad's tavern.  He knew all the artists in town and painted himself as a happy camper at least 3 times we know of.  There is no reason to imagine his marriage and household wasn't happy, either -- it's an island of calm in 25 pics painted over 25 years.  I guess you can't slander the dead, but as they used to say in the old days, there oughta be a law.

Colin Firth is otherwise fine as Heathcliff in this spin off of Wuthering Heights moved to Delft, and the rest of the cast as Heathcliff's batty family.  Remove the historicist pretension and the film works beautifully. Unfortunately, the cartooning of major artists is getting epedemic with films like Shakespeare in Love and Amadeus.  For kids raised on the History Channel, Hollywood as history, this is bad candy which shouldn't be accepted from stangers.

I kept hoping that the story would show up but it never did, unless of course the script read ""Scarlet Johansson stands wide eyed and fearful for the next hour and a half.""  The romance (if that was what it was) between Griet and the butcher's son was neither developed (did she love him or was she repulsed by him) or necessary.  Nor can I see any reason for the groping scene, the bratty daughter ""sub-plot"" (you must have a plot before you can have a sub-plot), or pretty much anything else in the movie.  I won't go as far as some to complain about the American accents, since the only way to have real authenticity in that department would be to have everyone speaking Dutch, but the ""creepy guy/stalker boss/all men are evil"" theme has been done to death and this movie provided us with two examples of it!

All I know is that she was from some religion that required women to cover their hair.  Also, Mrs. Vermeer could have been made more sympathetic, instead of appearing crazy and rather unattractive from the get go.  I also would have liked to see the romance between Greit and the ""Butcher boy"" develop more fully.

2006911,5,B0001K2L4W,"In this movie a young woman, Griet, is forced to leave home and find employment as a maid.  She finds herself in the home of the painter Vermeer and his family.  The setting is 17th century Holland, and the historically authentic sets and brilliant photography relentlessly drive home to the viewer the physical harshness of life in that time.  Even people of means must contend with cold and damp, filth, cramped living spaces, and a myriad other sources of physical discomfort.

But the film also explores the emotional suffering of the time through its portrayal of Vermeer's family.  We see very little kindness in this family, and plenty of resentment, grief, rage, sadness, and downright meanness.  Griet comes from a family which is very poor but which seems to have real affection for her.  Settling in with her employers, she must learn to navigate the shoals of the bitterness which surround her.  Indeed, the Vermeer family seems to be representative of an age when the currency of power dominated human relationships in a much more obvious and raw fashion than we see today.  The world outside Griet's family is one of darkness; grasping, cruelty, and ignorance are accepted modes of behavior.

But Griet does not become overwhelmed by this darkness.  Instead, she discovers the paintings of Vermeer.  Soon, her mind begins to open up to greater possibilities, and a new sort of consciousness seems to take hold in her.  As the movie progresses, she becomes caught up in the growth of her interior vision so much so that the destructive energies of the household cannot distract her from this growth.  In this way, she is an embodiment of the paintings themselves, which are very much about light appearing in the midst of darkness, and the power of illumination emerging from physical limitation.  The photography mirrors this theme, with shots that are lit in the same manner as Vermeer's paintings.  Thus the development of Griet's character, the photography, Vermeer's art, and the dynamics of the family conflict all weave together to create one overriding image:  light emerging from darkness.

This movie moves slowly. We watch a young woman's enlightenment taking place against a backdrop of rising tension and hatred which are intensified by her presence.  But it is the quality of her spirit more than her physical beauty which causes much of the tension within the family.  Johansson convincingly portrays a woman who embodies a luminous, interior beauty-- and it is this that thoroughly captivates the artist Vermeer.

A tacit love affair develops between Griet (Scarlett Johansson) and Vermeer (Colin Firth) though in a purely emotional and mental sense, as her appreciation of art, due to Griet's father being a painter, intrigues the master, and he begins to teach her about colour and the delicate skill of mixing paint to achieve just the right shade and depth. I loved the scene where Vermeer asks Griet to tell him the colour of the clouds in the sky. She responds with the answer, ""white"", to then observe more intently, to answer, ""Yellow, blue and grey..."" Vermeer is pleased with this answer.

It is no wonder that the film won many awards and was Oscar nominated for art direction, set design and costume design because the historical accuracy and beauty in all three categories is simply astounding.

In fact, viewing the DVD with a good friend, she would comment after a particular scene that she was sure she had seen ""that"" painting before. Going back over the film, one can almost detect past master works of that time. It would be interesting to investigate this further and possibly connect certain scenes with actual paintings of the period.

The soundtrack composed by Alexandre Desplat, also nominated for many awards including the Oscar for The Queen (2006) and the Golden Globe for The Painted Veil and Girl with a Pearl Earring, is both beautiful and haunting.

In itself, Girl with a Pearl Earring is a true work of art. The time spent and attention to detail certainly showed in the final product.

Director Peter Webber (Hannibal Rising 2007) managed a very young Scarlett Johansson to perform with mature restraint, concentrating on her expression, particularly those wonderful eyes.

I have never seen a movie whose all intension is to find, capture and portrait the scenes the Dutch masters were made famous for.. Just this makes you play with the movie, similar to kids playing ""I see"".. The production in this sense is flawless,, and the setting of the epoch is so real.. You can feel the tensions everywhere,, and there is this girl, no instructions whatsoever, but she has the gift and the genius to see what the master is doing and to even correct him!! This is what captivates him.. at the end of the movie, I cannot escape the feeling of contemplation of the Art Collector - as he has the painting in front of him, for his joy only- as he admires the painting.. We are to pass, yet we were given a chance to admire.. what else can you do?",1178841600,2,824,4.215189873417722
2006914,4,B0001K2L4W,"Girl with a Pearl Earring is based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier, who tells the story of a forbidden love affair between painting master, Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), and the only woman who seemed to appreciate his work, a timid young maid named Griet (Scarlett Johansson).  The two form a silent bond, a love for each other. Johannes appreciates Griet's company as a comfortable contrast to his mother-in-law, children, and especially his wife, who only seem to try to discourage his silly hobbies.

I was fascinated by this movie.  Every scene looked like a painting and they perfectly captured Vermeer's light. I also liked the historical references to how Vermeer liked to paint young people so he could work on big surfaces of colour and avoid the shading wrinkles give. The music was beautiful and gave off a Dutch feeling of the 17th century as it should have.  It was a perfect movie for someone interested in art.  Others might find it a bit tiring but if you are an art lover (or cannot get enough of Colin Firth) you definitely have to watch this.",1175126400,3,1063,4.693548387096774
2006915,4,B0001K2L4W,"I had to watch this movie for literature class and, judging from the past at the HORRIBLE books we have read for that class, expected this movie to suck badly. I was pleasantly surprised to know that it didn't! Girl With a Pearl Earring explores a theory of the biography of the largely unknown life of artist Johannes Vermeer, and his painting ""The Girl With a Pearl Earring,"" whose purpose still remains unknown. Scarlett Johansson plays young servant Griet who moves in with a very wealthy family consisting of the painter Vermeer, his wife, his children, and his mother-in-law. Vermeer spends all of his time in his private studio painting and does not let anyone in the house enter. Eventually as Griet works in the house Vermeer grows attracted to her and begins to paint her in his studio without the other mean-spirited owners of the house not knowing. The story progresses and is ultimately a very mysterious movie that uses a HELL of a lot of symbolism in every way, and every shot of the movie seems like an actual Vermeer painting. The movie explores with a theory many rumours whirling around the life of this painter and makes for a very interesting film. Definitely recommended, especially to those who love art and/or Vermeer.",1174521600,,1242,4.78139534883721

All through there are scenes which in themselves make perfectly-posed ""paintings"", and the camera- and lighting-experts deserve Oscars.

We are also so delighted with the score that we are going to buy the CD.

I have not read the book, but from what I understand, the book has considerably more detail in it.  This is detail which no doubt helps the reader understand more fully the situations and motives of the various characters.  Of necessity, a film adaptation has to omit a lot of detail or risk becoming hopelessly bogged down.  However, so much crucial information is left out here that the film achieves a certain weightless quality and simply drifts.  I found myself not caring a whit for any of these characters, none of whom could I identify as being even remotely a real person.

It wasn't a bad film by any means, but it lacked the necessary substance to make a lasting impression.  Very attractive, but that was about it for me.",1172448000,3,953,4.5588235294117645

An amazing feat in and of itself. This is a faithful adaptation of Tracy Chevalier's novel of the same name, and it elaborates on what is known (i.e. nothing) about the model in the famous portrait, and in so doing the motion picture crafts an entire backstory to explain the creation of a haunting painting. This movie is also a skilled depiction of life in the Netherlands three and a half centuries ago, during the one and only time that nation was a world power. And let's not forget the fine performances here by Colin Firth, and of course a siren-like and yet skillfully subdued Scarlett Johansson. This is one to see!",1169337600,4,781,4.708029197080292

This movie killed any interest I could have had with this story. I haven't seen such stiff and unconvincing actors in a long time that brought absolutely nothing to their characters worth any interest. Honestly they all bored me to tears. I can't really blame the actors though entirely, but Scarlett especially was boring. Movies of this sort can be so rich and wonderful if only there are characters worth giving a damn about, which there aren't in this film. They're so dull and lifeless in my opinion. Where's the passion at all? There is none. They just stand around staring blankly at each other but you're supposed to just get everything they don't do and don't say. And poor Cillian Murphy is so limited in this film, and yet to me was still ironically the most interesting person in the film.

What can I say? There is nothing I liked about this film. Sure the scenery is done well enough but the characters, the storyline itself- is not worth watching at all. So I say to pass this movie by. There are much better films in the same vein as this one with a much more interesting story and also characters.

Both the director of photography and the director of the film must have a deep knowledge of the way Johannes Vermeer - and his contemporaries - painted.

What first caght my attention when I watched this film was its photography, but I have to admit, the story, even so subtle as it is, is very touching. It bears the light fragrant of artistic passion and, even though it does not tread on traditional filming standards, it depicts quite exceptionally the kind of understanding that binds people who can 'see' and appreciate beauty, and the dangers and obstacles that lie in the path of their communication with the rest (and what tensions may arise due to sociological reasons - even though the present era differs in style and ethos from that of middle 1600s it is essentially characterized by similar social patterns).

That it looks beautiful should be and is a given, but more importantly it's a real piece of cinema. You really get a sense of the huge importance of art and the strong emotions it can unleash without resorting to speechifying or purple prose, just beautiful filmmaking that reveals a whole world with a subtle intensity: the wife's feeling of betrayal at the painting seems absolutely and horribly believable - it really is a far greater infidelity than if he had slept with her. There's a real sense of revelation to the film, a kind of early Christmas morning feeling. Scarlett Johansson is excellent, as for once is Colin Firth (a fine stage actor but all too often an uncomfortably constipated one on screen), but everything is just right about the movie.

Every shot is composed, lit and photographed as would Vermeer were he a filmmaker-every scene is a photo-painting in the style of the master. For the visual quality alone anyone with the eye, if not the actual skill of an artist , must see it.

As for the story, the very cleverly developed tale is an interesting, if not predictable one. A young peasant girl (Grete?), whose artist father was blinded, needs work and is employed by the Vermeer household as a servant. The household, apprently run by Vermeer's clever mother-in-law and which is captive of a lustful and wealthy patron, who lusts after the the newly hired servant girl-Grete, as does Vermeer, whose wife is in a constant state of pregnancy, leaving the artist to seek out other conquests, one of which may be the strong-willed servant girl. I won't spoil the rest of the plot which women may appreciate more than men, but I liked the film overall in the following breakdown:

The movie, ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"", is based on the fictional novel of the same name by author Tracy Chevalier. It isn't known who the girl in the painting actually is and I think the novel (for which the moive is based) does a wonderful job of speculating who the subject of the painting actually is...... Actress, Scarlett Johansson, plays the part of a maid for the Vermeer family named Griet. Griet becomes the muse/inspiration for the painting when Johannes Vermeer is commissioned by a wealthy patron of the arts to paint Griet as the subject for Vermeer's next painting.

2006947,5,B0001K2L4W,"At just a little over an hour and a half, this film is very different from 1991's four hour long ""La Belle Noiseuse"" which was also about the relationship between an artist and his model.  That film was more about the artistic process itself, whereas ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is more of a historical and sociological study, with a little bit of art on top.

The dominant image this film leaves is of the rigid social and economic class structure of 17th century Holland, which all of the characters including the artist Vermeer are all bound by.  A more descriptive title for this movie might have been, ""Life of a 17th Century Dutch Maid-cum-Model.""

Cinematography is gorgeous, the whole film has the color and lighting of a Vermeer painting in fact.  Unlike most European art and art/historical films this one has fairly decent pacing, so even the more attention-span-challenged viewers will survive.  Johansson is perfectly cast, and all the actors perform well.  This certainly ranks as a film worth watching more than once.",1153872000,3,1032,4.896551724137931

The cinematography and music was awe inspiring at many moments too.

As for shortcomings, the movie feels like it could have gone further in terms of the storytelling and building of a conflict. In the end, the situation lands into what feels as a rather abrupt ending leaving a few underdeveloped elements, such as the case of the painter's daughter and the painter's patron and own their respective mini-plots with the maid.

Rather, I think the camera is infatuated with her, which is appropriate considering that the theme of this film is the deep connection between art and eros.

This carefully constructed film shows that art is transgressive, even that it is a kind of rape, as the scene in which Vermeer pierces young Griet's earlobe clearly reveals. The billowing white garments on their clotheslines, the carefully pressed white cap which must be put aside for the artful headpiece in the painting, the washtubs and soap scrubbing scenes -- all of these contribute to the theme, most baldly revealed when Vermeer's patron Pieter Van Ruijven violently approaches Griet by the clotheslines. ""Unplucked still?"" he asks. All that's left to expose is the proverbial blood on the sheets.

If Vermeer truly has, as Griet accuses him, ""looked inside"" her to paint his picture, his wife, played brilliantly by Essie Davis, is right to feel betrayed. Mother and son-in-law play pimp to the quasi-pornographic, voyeuristic needs of the patron. The film explores this nexus of interests slowly, carefully, with a single-minded focus that itself amounts to a kind of rape. A very dark film about the intimate link between sex and art. So single-minded that it sometimes feels heavy-handed, though the photography is luminous.",1151539200,4,1466,5.129707112970712
2006960,5,B0001K2L4W,"This film captures social, cultural and everyday life in 17th Century Holland beautifully and artistically through the eyes of Griet, a young hired servant who works in the household of a famous Dutch artist. Her emotions are captured superbly by the camera through long and short shots of her facial features. Griet is perfectly portrayed by Scarlett Johanssen. Essentially, the film is about the relationship that develops very gradually and subtley between the artist Johannes Vermeer and Griet as she learns about creating art. She is sent by her family to work in their house because her father is ill and the family needs the money. Griet learns a lot about different lifestyles and class differences by living with this family. She sees how the artist and his family totally depend on the patron for their living. They plan a grand dinner for the patron, Van Ruijven and his family to unveil the completion of a portrait of his wife and also to celebrate the birth of a baby into the Vermeer household. The dependency of the artist and his family on the patron, the absolute need to accomodate to his personal tastes and wishes, no matter what his character and behavior ... even to the point of compromise and deception within the Vermeer family is very well shown. Griet's own limited choices in life, her budding friendship with the butcher's son, the possibility for romance and a future together is nicely presented.

The flow of life within the Vermeer household is artistically filmed using different color schemes and shadings of light ... portrayng the life of the servants contrasted with the life of the family. Colin Firth plays Vermeer, the quiet, handsome, brooding and thoughtful artist ... He shuts himself off in his studio to paint, to create artistic pieces using elegant color and light, capturing distinct moods and feelings. His wife Catherine is less artistic and more shallow. She is viewed as the dependent, spoiled wife of the artist, whose wit and charm can have a razor sharp edge when they are crossed. Her instincts register a threat after Griet's sleeping quarters are moved to the artists studio although the move is done to provide privacy for another servant. When Catherine again becomes pregnant ...  Catherine's mother makes clear that everyone depends on Vermeer for their livlihoods - she is not averse to deceiving her own daughter by letting Johannes paint Griet in order to continue their lifestyle. Griet is warned by Pietr, the butcher's son, ""you are a fly in his web"". The character of Van Ruijven is very well explored ... catering to his whims and procliviites.  There are several episodes within the film where Catherine's shrewish jealous fits are sure signs that Griet's future is not assured within this family structure. Rumors surface at the marketplace about Griet and the artist. Amazingly, there is a magnificent conclusion to the events of Griet's relationship with Johannes Vermeer. The ending is quite touching and sensitively filmed. For this viewer, it was a total surprise.

2006961,3,B0001K2L4W,"Based upon a best selling book of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, they were not fully realized. While the cinematography is exquisite, as every frame brings to mind a Vermeer painting or one by an old Dutch master, the film is static and becomes enervated, sinking into a torpor that not even its beauty can cure.

The story line seems fairly simple. A pretty and seemingly intelligent Dutch girl, Griet (Scarlett Johansson), daughter of an artisan with failing eyesight, goes to work as a maid the home of painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), when her family's financial circumstance mandates that she seek employment. While in the Vermeer household, she is caught up in the undercurrents that exist within. When Griet catches the eye of Vermeer's wealthy patron (Tom Wilkinson), she becomes the object of the patron's lust, the object of Vermeer's wife's (Essie Davis) jealousy, and the subject of one of Vermeer's most noted paintings.

Unfortunately, the storyline is static in its presentation, never fully realizing any of its plots or sub-plots. Too much is left unexplained and too little is alluded for the viewer to draw inferences to fill in the story gaps. This is a shame, given the time, expense, and attention to detail given to the entire production. Consequently, the film moves as if it were a montage of beautifully drafted paintings transplanted to film. It is ponderously slow, forgetting that it is a film requiring some cohesion of story or plot, something that this film lacks. More telling, it lacks real dramatic tension. It is almost as if the filmmaker were more interested in the form of the film rather than its substance. Therein lies the rub.

Still, the sheer beauty of the cinematography alone makes this film worth seeing. Seventeenth century Holland is painstakingly brought to life. There is no detail that is left to chance in the exquisite re-creation of the environs and material goods of the characters. Much effort is devoted to authenticity of detail. Moreover, the use of lighting is extraordinary, causing every scene to look as if it were a moment captured in time for all posterity. This film was justifiably nominated for an Academy Award in 2004 for its cinematography. I am only surprised that it lost to Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.

Scarlett Johanssen bears a remarkable resemblance to the subject of the noted painting by Vermeer, and she shimmers with a compelling luminosity throughout the film. She is simply sheer physical perfection in the role. In terms of illuminating the viewer as to the psyche of her character, she falls somewhat short, giving only tantalizing glimpses of what lays beneath her impassive demeanor, as she forms a bond with Vermeer, sharing a seemingly mutual appreciation of aesthetics. Colin Firth, in the role of Vermeer, falls a little short of the mark. Disheveled and seemingly unkempt, he appears doltish and boorish rather than artistic. One gets very little sense of the artist through his performance, but, in all fairness, he has very little dialogue with which to work. Perhaps that is intentional, as a sublimation to his artistry. The viewer is left unsure. Whatever the reason, his performance simply fails to paint a meaningful portrait of the artist.

The roles of Vermeer and Griet are the primary roles, yet they fail to carry the film, as they are too underdeveloped to convey the story the director seems to be trying to tell. Essie Davis gives an excellent performance as Catharina, Vermeer's jealous and histrionic wife. Judy Parfitt is compelling as Maria Thins, Vermeer's practical and socially conscious mother-in-law. Tom Wilkinson gives a fine performance as the wealthy, lustful patron, Van Ruyven. Cillian Murphy is outstanding as Pieter, the very handsome butcher's boy who falls in love with Griet. Joanna Scanlan is very good in the role of Tannake, the cook and housekeeper. Still, their performances are not sufficient to bring the story together, as they are secondary characters that are as underdeveloped as the primary ones.

Undoubtedly he spent most of his time and received most of his income from managing the tavern, where, as was often done, he also sold art works (few of them his own), and taking care of his 11 children.  The family was probably ""middle class"", but far from wealthy, as they are portrayed in this film.  Vermeer only painted about 40 paintings during his life, with no known royal patrons, so he could hardly have become wealthy at it, as some such as Titian were able to do. The tavern/art dealer business is not presented in this film at all. Nor is there any evidence of problems in the relationship between Vermeer and his wife, as the film depicts.  At Vermeer's death, his family was deeply in debt and had to sell some of his paintings.",1142812800,2,1069,4.684491978609626
2006992,5,B0001K2L4W,"Rarely is a film adaptation  so vastly much better than the book that inspired it as is this one.  First-time director Peter Webber makes something of a visual feast out of Tracy Chevalier's extremely thin novel about the painting of one of the world's most beautiful Old Masters. Scarlett Johanssen is ideally cast as Griet, a young Protestant in seventeeth-century Delft who crosses to the Catholic side of the town (where women do not always cover their hair, as she must) to work as a maid in the house of Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). Within her workaday life Griet discovers the combustible tensions within the Vermeer household, ruled over by his vain and insecure spendthrift wife (Essie Davis) and her shrewd mother (the estimable Judy Parfitt), who must figure out how to market her son-in-law's painting so as to keep their burgeoning household going. Complicating matters even further is their spoiled daughter Cornelia (Alakina Mann, the otherworldly daughter from THE OTHERS), and the fact that both Vermeer and his patron (Tom Wilkinson) cannot  keep their eyes off of the gorgeous Griet. The film takes full advantage of its painterly subject, and each scene is staged and lit so exquisitely it seems to have been painted by Vermeer or his peers. Wisely, Webber and his screenwriter, Olivia Hetreed, keep the dialogue to an absolute minimum, allowing the actors to express what they cannot say to one another in the repressed Delft atnmosphere via looks and body language. Johanssen and Firth have never been better, although the real honors might go to Parfitt (in a marvelously complex performance). And Davis also acquits herself beautifully in her unsympathetic role of Catarina, and gets besides to deliver the film's most classic line when she finally unveils the title painting that has been kept hidden from her.",1140307200,3,1838,5.079470198675497
2006993,5,B0001K2L4W,"One of the things that Tracy Chevalier wanted to do in the novel was to make the relationship between Griet and Johannas Vermeer nonsexual.  Olivia Hetreed's script and the direction by Peter Webber adhere to this ideal.  In her imaginings of what the girl with the pearl earring was like and what her life was like, I believe Chevalier thought it would be romantic in an artistic sense to have Vermeer's interest in her be artistic and not carnal.  It is obvious from the exquisite beauty of the painting (actual title: ""Girl in a Turban"") that he very much admired her.  It is difficult for me to believe that in that admiration he did not also feel some desire for her.

Be that as it may--and I certainly respect Chevalier's interpretation and in fact think it makes for a more interesting story than if there had been some sexual involvement--Vermeer's wife, Catharina, sees in the painting beauty that she herself does not possess.  She also cannot help but wonder just what it is that her husband and the pretty young girl do during all those hours upstairs.  Yet, the emphasis is on Catharina's jealousy of Griet's beauty and not on any imagined infidelity.  I think this is consistent with Chevalier's interpretation of what the relationship between the maid and the great artist might have been.

This movie surprised me in how beautiful it is and how carefully Peter Webber, whose previous credits are in television, reconstructed 17th century Delft, Holland.  If you go to the IMDb you will see that there were some goofs and anachronisms, such as a person in the background in one scene riding a bicycle.  However, the Holland of 340 years ago seemed authentic and graphically atmospheric, including all the chores Griet had to do and the errands she had to run--note her red and bruised hands.  (They used lye in soap in those days.)

Still the open air market could have used a few more flies (ha!) and the butcher boy (Cillian Murphy) was entirely too pretty (ha!), but Vermeer's studio seemed magical and I love the mixing of the colors and the way the light came through the windows.  There are at least three Vermeer paintings in which we see the same light from the same window: the title painting; the painting he was working on without the chair in the foreground that Griet removed called, ""Young Woman with a Water Jug""; and ""The Painter's Studio.""  If I made a list of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, Girl with a Pearl Earring would make the list, along with, e.g., Zhang Yimou's Raise the Red Lantern (1992) and Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975) and maybe a dozen more.

As for Scarlett Johansson who had the title role I must say she won me over.  At first I thought she was a bit too voluptuous for the part.  (It is interesting to compare the reconstruction of the painting with Johansson with the original shown at the end of the movie.  The real girl was a bit more delicate and of course not as sensual as Johansson.)  Johansson won me over because of the subtly of her interpretation and because of the hard work she obviously put into the part.  She is an actress we will see a lot of in the future.  If you want to see her in less severe garb, catch her in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation (2003) where her sensual beauty is more fully presented.

Colin Firth very much caught the intensity of the artist and seemed to do so almost without effort.  His eyes beheld Griet and indeed all the world not in a carnal way, but in the penetrating way of the artist who wants to see the world as it really is, not as our needs demand.  We see this in the scene in which he insists that Griet see the real colors in the clouds, not just the white that we think we see.  Note too (continuing Chevalier's theme) that it would be inopportune, careless and threatening to his artistic career for Vermeer to have an affair with the maid since with his mother-in-law in the house (her house, her money), and his wife and some nosy, tattling children, he would have been caught.  Vermeer only completed about 40 paintings in his lifetime.  His wife (or most especially his mother-in-law) was indeed his most important ""patron.""  An artist without a patron sleeps in the streets, especially in such a mercantile world as a small town in 17th century Holland.

Catharina Vermeer (Essie Davis in an underappreciated role) provided exactly the right counterpoint with her vile, snake-in-the-garden-of-artistic-eden presence and her purely burgher mentality and her oppressive jealousy and her high-handed treatment of her servants.  Without Davis's excruciatingly vivid performance this movie would have been flat and lacking in tension.

As for the ending and for the inevitable comparison with the novel, let's say the ending here (and the question of Griet's future life with the ""butcher boy"") is more open to interpretation than in the book where more is explained.  (See my review, or better yet read the novel.)  The strength of the book is in how deeply we can go into the mind of Griet and into the artistic intimacy of her relationship with Vermeer, whereas in the movie we can more fully appreciate the atmosphere and the beauty of the artist's vision.

By the way, in the novel it is clear that Griet does indeed desire Vermeer but realizes that his station is too much above hers, and his circumstances with five children and a sixth on the way leave no room for her.  Also clear in both mediums is the fact that Vermeer's exquisite portrait is, in effect, his way of making love to her.",1138060800,4,5533,4.656378600823046
2006994,4,B0001K2L4W,"Girl with a Pearl Earring not only dazzled me with it's amazing direction but it also opened my eyes to the extream potential of young actress Scarlett Johansson.  God knows I'm a big fan, having loved her performances in movies like 'Lost in Translation' and 'Love Song for Bobby Long' but here, in the eyes of Griet, I saw range I didn't know an actress of her age could possess.  No wonder she's been nominated FOUR times in the past THREE years at the golden globes...She's amazing.  The film centers around Griet, a poor peasent girl in 17th century Holland who must move into and work for a Catholic family since her father can no longer work.  She is a hard worker yet critisized harshly due to her masters fondness for her and the families anger towards that.  Her master, famous painter Johannes Vermeer, is obviously smitten with her innosence and beauty, but so are others, others who want her for themselves.  And then theres Vermeer's wife who is incredibly jealous of Griet as if from day one at that.  The film may move slowly but its in order to capture the way things were and the way things needed to be.  I felt it was superb, mostly due to the amazing acting on the part of Johansson.  I give it 4 1/2* mostly because after you look at Johansson's performance...no one else really stands out.  Firth is stiff as a board and boring to say the least, Murphy is decent but it was really this year that he shone as an acter and leading man...it's Davis, the jealous wife, that struck me out of the rest of the cast as noteworthy, mostly due to her outburst towards the climax of the film.  Throughout the whole film you see this fear, dread, misery, hatetred in her eyes and it's at the moment she confronts Griet and her husband and her mother about the infamous painting that you see the truth behind those eyes...",1138060800,,1832,4.471471471471472
2006995,5,B0001K2L4W,"As I watched this movie it seemed to me that the substance of the story is all about projection.  This is a completely made up story (except for the details of it is believed Vermeer actually worked), a Romance in the original sense of the word, or a ""backstory"" to use a particularly ugly term that seems to be used lately, on the famous painting by Johannes Vermeer.  It is set in Vermeer's 17th century Delft and mostly in his house.  The movie is based on a novel by Tracy Chevalier (of whom I know nothing).

What do I mean by projection?  Well, it is natural that when you or I look at the painting and see this enigmatic young woman, we begin to ask ourselves questions about who she is and what she is thinking and feeling.  When we begin to answer those questions we are projecting from our inner self onto the painting things that are not there.  It says everything about us, but nothing real about the painting.  We may even love the painting for the story it represents for us, but do not mistake it for the piece Vermeer painted.

The film opens with vegetables being cut, rather slowly.  Their colors are saturated and let us know what the visual effect of the film is going to be.  The movie is framed, lit, and given the color of Vermeer paintings.  There is strong light and shadow effects and at times the kind of almost washed away look that some of the paintings have today.

We don't know who the girl preparing the salad is.  Even when we hear her name called, ""Griet"", we do not know if the woman commanding her is her mistress, a head servant, or her mother.  We start putting pieces together when she talks with this man who clearly has suffered a severe accident.  He is her father and the girl is being sent away to be a servant.  The father was a painter of sorts - for ceramics and gives her a memento of one of the tiles he has painted.  So, we begin our projection.  What was his accident?  What were their circumstances before and after?  What will become of them?

When Griet (Scarlett Johansson) shows up at the Vermeers' it is obvious that the mistress of the house does not feel comfortable about having this pretty young girl in the household.  The other servants are wary of her, but soon take her to heart.  I won't provide any more of the plot except to note that Griet has the same effect on everyone in the film as she has on us in the painting (remember that this character is entirely made up - know one knows who the girl in the painting really was or when it was actually made, although there are good guesses).  Vermeer (Colin Firth) projects on her an understanding for his art that she likely does not posses, although the wonder of the art is powerful to her.  Van Ruijven, Vermeer's principle patron (Tom Wilkinson), projects his own appetites and lusts for the girl onto Vermeer and Griet.  The wife (Essie Davis) projects her fears about her husband onto Griet and blames her for the alienation she feels.  The only one who seems to see reality is the mother-in-law (Judy Parfitt).

This is a visually beautiful movie, and we do get to see something about how Vermeer's art was made.  However, it is vital that no one take this absolutely fictional story, no matter how accurate the historical setting, as anything real about the artist, his family, his patrons, or the real girl with a pearl earring.",1137542400,3,3354,4.433006535947713
2006996,5,B0001K2L4W,"At its core, Girl With a Pearl Earring is a study of power and entrapment.  Nearly everyone has personal desires that they must depend upon someone else to provide: Vermeer longs for someone to understand his love of painting, his wife wants the attention of her cool and distant husband as well as status in society, and Griet wants to keep her job in order to provide for her family.  Only the art patron can afford to be fickle in his desires and he is the one to whom they all must unwillingly pander to ensure their financial security.  Although the pace of the movie is slow, the developing relationship between Griet and Vermeer and the rising tension in the household are engaging enough to make the viewer want to see what will happen next.  Scarlett Johansson does an excellent job of portraying quiet and vulnerable Griet whose curiosity is in conflict with her desire to maintain her morality (and her job) and Colin Firth, as the enigmatic Vermeer, displays the power to entrance as he pushes her to the edge of discomfort with his physical and emotional advances.  Although fictional, the story is entirely plausible, and makes for an absorbing tale about the famous painting.",1134864000,4,1190,4.757281553398058
2006997,3,B0001K2L4W,"Just like Vermeer's painting, the color of lighting in this movie is always vivid. Never too bright. Watching this movie is like seeing a thousand pieces of Dutch painting. Each frame is a painting. Beautiful setting. Glarring costumes. Perfect lighting. Clever angles. Dazzling scenes. This movie is crafted so well visually.

Adapted from Tracy Chevalier's novel, the movie tells a story about events surrounding the making of the ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"", a painting made in 17th century by Dutch master Johannes Vermeer. Following the novel's plot, the girl in the painting is described as a young peasant maid named Griet (played by Scarlet Johannson).

She was working in the house of painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), and became his talented assistant and the model for one of Veermer's most famous works.

The movie is successful in capturing subtle and complex process of the making of arts. In fact, the movie itself is a kind of visual art. It brilliantly brings the Dutch painter's life and the shimmering city of Delft in the 17th century Holland to reality on the screen. The main actors also play so well. With not many dialogues, they act so well with body languages and gestures.

However, I feel that this movie is so dull. What's missing is the emotion. The story is not interesting. The pace is too slow. At the end the whole movie is just a beautiful piece of art without soul.",1132358400,2,1407,4.825726141078838
2006998,4,B0001K2L4W,"Based on a novel by Tracy Chevalier, this film tells the story behind the Vermeer painting that shares its title with the film.  In this imagining, the model is Griet (Scarlett Johanssen), a peasant girl with a natural artistic temperament.  Before long, she and the painter Vermeer (Colin Furth) recognize each other as kindred souls who understand each other because they both understand and love the technique and artistry of painting.  Thankfully, this film does not have them fall into bed together but rather recognizes that such a union could never come to pass.  In this way, it is a poignant story of lost opportunity and unrequitable passion.

This film also presents a fascinating, detailed, beautifully photographed portrait of life in 17th century Holland.  I was also intrigued by its take on the artist/patron relationship. Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) is well aware of the power he holds over Vermeer and his large family, and he is subtly cruel in the way he lords it over them.",1128124800,6,994,4.957831325301205

The colors, the lighting, the costumes made this visually entertaining!  The acting was also great and believable.

But I did not like the script at all.  I couldn't help comparing it with the book throughout most of the movie.  There was a lot that was missed and, had it been included, it would have made for a better story.  Although... I do prefer the ending of the movie and wished the book ended the same way.",1127952000,3,587,4.2342342342342345
2007010,5,B0001K2L4W,"I'd like to point out,  as a professional in the arts world,  that this scenario is the first I have ever seen successfully to treat the inter-relationships among art, libido,  money,  and power.

While this is a beautiful film about the making of an important work of art,  it is by no means smarmy or sentimental.  ALL the characters are flawed,  event the innocent-appearing servant girl (who uses her butcher boy suitor to assuage her unconsommated love/lust for Vermeer).  Everyone has an angle,  as they used to say in 1940's gangster movies.

Vermeer himself is no prize -- unable by the force of circumstances to act on his attraction to the servant girl,  he gives her not even a glance as she leaves his household in semi-disgrace,  even though she has (symbolically) given up her virginity to the artist and his painting.

Yet,  from the interactions of all these morally compromised characters comes a fabulous work of art,  the painting we contemplate at the very end.  Quite amazing,  quite miraculous,  and quite close to how the process works in the real world among actual human beings. Five stars for this scenario (and ten,  or five hundred,  whatever you like) for the visuals.",1127779200,8,1197,4.826732673267327
2007011,5,B0001K2L4W,"First of all, the setting was beautiful.  The color of the lighting was vivid, and yet never too bright, just like the lighting in Vermeer's painting.  I have to say, every scene in the movie was a painting on its own.  The script was a really good adaptation of the fictional novel.  Some might say that part of the film could be shorten to keep the film focus.  I thought that the pace of the film was chosen in such way so that the audience could grasp what it was like to live a life such as Griet's.  Beside the inexplicable mutual appreciation with her master, Griet was such a vibrant character that her every move brought uneasiness, not to mention jealousy, to the people around her.  Her admiration for Vermeer did not develop over night, but rather steadily.  Vermeer never said anything excessive to her. In fact, there were only a couple of occassions that really reached out to her heart, encouraged her to boldly step out of her servent clothes, and became the muse of a famous painting.  The audience would not want to be bombarded with the irrationality of Vermeer's wife and the malice of his daughter one after another.  The anticipation to a climax already filled the air every time she was up in the studio quietly dabbing the dust or whatnot.  The casting was superb.  Colin Firth played Vermeer in a similar fashion as he played Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, only replacing pride with solitude and apathy for anything outside of his painting.  Firth was good with this sort of silent roles, because he acted in such a way that you couldn't tell whether he was really interested or not, and that definitely built up the anticipation.  His eyes could be cold when something did not suit his thoughts, and yet they could be passionate otherwise.  Scarlett Johansson's acting was just vibrant.  As young as she was, her radiance was spearing through from beneath the face of a 20-year-old, just like how Griet could not cover up her intelligence and beauty in those plain servent clothes.  Cilian Murphy was brilliant at playing the combination of Pieter and Griet's brother Frans in the movel.  One could tell in his face that he knew what was going on, but he always kept it to himself in front of Griet, a flawless portrayal to the role.  Essie Davis's role as the jealous wife was amazing.  Even I felt sorry that she was as unreasonable as such.  In conclusion, if you appreciate the beauties in silence and subtlety, this film is for you.",1127692800,5,2463,4.6160919540229886

The film focuses around the simple but powerful anecdote , how this picture was done. Scarlett Johansson shines with her fantastic performance. Colin Firth is impressive too as the Delft ' s genius, but Tom Wilkinson is outstanding and deserves all the best comments.

2007014,5,B0001K2L4W,"The movie was beautiful- stunning and a wonderful success in making a film that looks like a Vermeer paining.  Remember, though, that this is an entirely fictional story- conjured in the imagination of Tracy Chevalier.  If you are an academic or art history buff, you will be appalled by this totally fictional account that implies a basis in fact.  There is no record of a maid named Griet- she is entirely fictional.  It is also mean-spirited and unfair to the memory of Vermeer and his wife Catherina, a form of vicious gossip  against easy targets- victims who are incapable of defending themselves.  The picture painted of the family is that of a nasty wife and mother in law and several spoiled brats in the house of a wimpy  painter dependent on his creative talent.  Actually, the Vermeers were in more of a lower middle class position and Vermeer's ""day job"" was as an art dealer.  Not the kind of household that would breed the nasty brats the kids were depicted to be.  There's no information on these children or their personalities, so why make up such a mean-spirited depiction?  Also, the mother in law, Maria Thins, was the victim of domestic abuse by her husband, having been beaten when she was pregnant, dragged out of bed naked when she was sick, and in general lived in humiliation until she escaped.  Not consistent with the iron-willed matriarch in the movie.  Again, why be so vicious to someone when there's not a shred of evidence that the true person was anything but a decent woman trying to make the best of a very difficult life?

Not much is known about Vermeer's private life, either, but to the best of current knowledge, he and Catherine were deeply in love throughout their marriage.  Vermeer married her despite a conflict of religion, and she gave birth 15 times (several died in infancy), at a time when it was common among the Dutch to practice family planning (generally families had 2 or 3 children).  Vermeer did paint Catherina in several of his paintings, and when he died leaving her an enormous debt and eleven children to feed, she fought valiantly to keep his works when, if she were truly greedy and didn't appreciate his art, she could have sold them for quite a bit of money.

Most academics believe that the girl in ""The Art of Painting"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" are the same model- Vermeer's eldest daughter, Maria.

Her moods were vibrantly portrayed, even though at the same time, always mild and subdued.  I was deeply impressed by her acting, and I am not one easily impressed.

Cillian Murphy was perfect for the role of the butcher's son.

Although I enjoyed Colin Firth's performance, I did not feel loyal to him as Vermeer.  I am satisfied with his being cast, but there are others who could have fit the part just as well.

2007018,5,B0001K2L4W,"This excellent film can be enjoyed at four different levels. Of course not every level is appreciated by all viewers, as evidenced by some of the reviews.

The film can be viewed as a smoldering and mismatched romance; an essay on class difference and the loborious life of the 17th century for the poor; an art historical film; or a beautiful film that evokes Delft Holland in the 1600's with amazing grace and beauty.

First, the young working girl, Griet, played very sensitively by Scarlett Johanssen, is caught between the attentions of a smoldering, moody Johannes Vermeer and a handsome butcher's assistant, who is her own age and class.  Colin Firth plays the part of Vermeer very well. He appreciates intelligence and beauty and he sees these qualities in Griet. She is gradually asked to assume more duties of the artist assistant as well as her duties cleaning the Vermeer home. Vermeer is married however with 5 or 6 kids (they keep popping up and it is hard to keep count). His aristocratic wife Maria grows more jealous of Griet as her husband's appreciation and attention toward Griet increase. When Maria is told by her oldest daughter that Vermeer has been secretly painting Greit's portrait as a commission from his patron, Master van Ruijven, she has a major melt-down which results in Griet being fired from her job and thus ending the budding love between Griet and Vermeer. This is a blessing. Now nothing should stand in the way of Griet's attraction with the butcher boy, her match in beauty, wit, class, and age.

Second, the working poor in the 17th century never got a break. Cooking and cleaning consumed long 16 hour days. Since there was no refrigeration in spring, summer, and autumn, cooking was a daily ritual of buying food in the market, preparing it ;such as beheading the animals and skinning them before putting them on a work burning hearth.  Poor Greit sweeps, mops, cleans, scrubs,shops, cooks, serves table, feeds kids, etc all day long until she is allowed to sleep in a ratty basement or freezing attic. The film realistically captures the terrible amount of labor the working poor had to endure.

Third, the films was excellent art history, explaining the camera obscura technique as well as giving a good explantion of the underpainting process that Vermeer used to create his small masterpieces. The range of pigments and the hard work of grinding the paint pigments into paint paste was very well done. Even the artists of the time had to labor just to produce the products they used in production of a painting.

Fourth, the film itself is superbly beautiful. The slower pace captures the 17th century. The settings, both interior and exterior were beautiful and probably the best art direction of 2004.

I hate mindless action films full of murder and sarcastic testosterone filled bullys ; so you can see my attraction to an intelligent and beautiful film.",1114905600,8,2907,4.870445344129554
2007019,4,B0001K2L4W,"Girl With A Pearl Earring is a decent period/artist biopic. It excels in creating a strong mood, but lack interesting story that it fell rather slow most of the time. If it weren't for the participation of Scarlett Johansson(Griet, the muse/servant) and the mysterious and sexy Colin Firth(Johannes Vermerr, the painter), then this film would lack the heart to capture the audiences attension. It's not a very entertaining movie, and it's not emotionally impacting like Frida and Pollock.

Vermeer is a struggling artist who paints portraits for wealthy clients including Van Ruijven(Tom Wilkinson in a low-key villian character). He's a often silent and submissive man under the control of his emotionally unstable wife(Maria/Judy Parfitt), and his overly eccentric mother. Griet is his maid, and she eventually became his inspiration for his most famous painting simply known as Girl With A Pearl Earring, and it was commisioned by Ruijven, because he desired Griet to the point of almost raping her. Griet secretly had a crush on Vermeer, and the painting of her portrait ultimately caused the wife to have a nervous breakdown, because she was so insecure.

The story pretty much revolved around the events that took place before, during and after the completion of the famous portrait. I found the reaction of Maria was so hideous when she lost herself emotionally and verbally just because her husband didn't paint her portrait. She behave like a child trying to get a toy or something. Tom Wilkinson is good as usual, even though his role is kind of nasty. The most memorable scene was when Vermeer pierced Griet's unpierced ear. Scarlett was mesmerizing when she shed a few drops of tears before giving ""The Look"" to the artist. Colin Firth was great in the lead role, but it was underwritten, and didn't quite explain his ""inner world"" and why he was so quite all the time.",1113782400,3,1881,4.987261146496815

Colin Firth is moody and sexy as ever, but not a lot happens in the story. The whole movie is shot to look like the painting, which is beautiful. If you're looking for excitement, this is not for you. If you want a movie that evokes a variety of intense feelings, this is it.",1113696000,3,417,4.036144578313253

2007032,4,B0001K2L4W,"Using absolutely stunning imagery and sets with a artistically shot work, Girl With a Pearl Earring is a beautiful picture with a relatively thin story.  Recreating the Flemish 17th century to tell the story about an enigmatic yet less than revolutionary painting might seem like little to which a story could be built about especially in comparison to ""the Da Vinci Code"" but this movie establishes a pretty notable plot and delivers the audience a convincing feel once again proving that good movies can be built on minimal premise if done with an attention to detail and a sense of caring.  All that being said this movie could be viewed with the sound off and still be impressive.  The costumes are very authentic and not overly garish or even too clean like we often see in period piece film.  The sets used are too well done both in the adorned homes and the bawdy and ruff taverns.  But something more is working in this film: there is a plot as tightly woven as the alleys of a Flemish walled city with as many loves, lies and secrets that any one romance film can handle.

The film painstakingly assures the viewers of the class differences between the servants including Griet, the girl with the pearl earring, the artist and his upper class clients.  This is historically accurate and well portrayed.  Though the script is relatively austere the pictures provide words unto themselves.  Using the copious Flemish and Dutch still life paintings as a guide to the style of the age it appears that the set designers may have laid the imagery on a little thick but never the less this is an art movie and a movie about art so the more allusion the better even if it is at the expense of realism.  I enjoyed the film and while the ending is less than a resolution to the plot it was effective.  Vermeer is one of those artists that, in spite of his enormous talent, seems to get less than his full share of regard in the pantheon of European masters.  I certainly think this film provides some needed recognition and is a very good period piece film.  I recommend this as a top rank romantic film and a decent art film all alike. For students of history and art history this film to provides a great background on an era though it must be remembered that this is historical fiction.  Overall very enjoyable!

2007033,5,B0001K2L4W,"The first time I watched this film I had to pick my jaw up from the floor several times before it dropped once more. ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" is based on the movel by Tracy Chevalier. Once my library has a copy of the book to read, I am picking it up.

Simply, this is one of the most stunning and gorgeous movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Each and every shot is framed perfectly compositionally-wise, and the lighting as well as cinematography of Eduardo Serra is simply wonderful. Nearly each and every frame looks as if it was from an actual painting of Vermeer himself, which truly added to how seducing the film was, especially as an art student.

The acting is surberb by Scarlett Johansson who plays Griet, and her resemblence to the actual maid in the painting is eerie. Colin Firth as Vermeer and the chemistry he had on set with Johansson was perfect for the film, which only added to how stunning this movie really is. It was robbed of many Oscar nominations, and I would highly, highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in art and in art history. This movie is truly a pleasure for the eyes, and should be recognize much more than it is now.",1112140800,2,1189,4.4

First of all, you should always read the book first, before seeing the movie.  This was quite possibly one of the worst reproductions of a book I have ever seen.  I hate it when they do this.

The novel is intricately wonderful and the film destroys it!  If you are thinking about watching the movie, DON'T!  Read the novel and be content with it.  The movie was absolutely horrible, but if you are interested in the story line, you should read the book.",1111276800,17,564,4.264150943396227
2007035,5,B0001K2L4W,"It is a joy to watch this definitive art movie, helped with one of the most exceptional cinemaphotagraphy ever made. The entire film was like stepping into a painting and each scene is like a painting in itself. It always amazes me how good a movie can be with so little dialogue spoken. A good actor can speak volumes with just a glance. A stolen glance, or a seemingly accidental touch between the two central characters---the artist Johannes Vermeer and his iridescent house maid Griet, communicated more subtly than any words could ever. I have always loved Flemish paintings for their simplicity and the use of light. And this is story telling at its best, a movie with heart and soul...about a painting many art critics call  ""The Mona Lisa of the North.""

This is not a fast paced movie. Vermeer's paintings are incredibly hypnotic, drawing us into a time and place that no longer exists.  The elementally envigorating music mixes well with the time and place. It's good to be transported several centuries back to live for a moment through the eyes of Griet (Johanson) and Vermeer (Firth). They played well the repressed passion between the two that was so thrilling where the film stayed so close to the plot of the book.  I would recommend this film to anyone who has an eye for beauty or films that involve thought and emotion rather than just gratuitous explosions of violence and random sex...despite some flawed pieces in the story line: In the  film, as in the book,  the painting is commissioned by the patron Van Ruiven specifically because he is in lust with Griet, and Van Ruiven carefully specified who he wanted to be in it (Griet). Katarina's (Vermeer's wife) fury towards the end of the film therefore doesn't make sense at all.

Also Vermeer's gift to Griet of the pearl earrings  is not believable. At the end of the film (and story),  Vermeer would have known that after several years,  Griet was married and living comfortably, while his eleven children were going to be destitute when he is gone. It is hard to believe that he would have given away valuable pearls to a former maid, even under the strength of his feelings for her, when the earrings weren't even his to give; they belonged to his wife.

Still the movie is  a stunning visual experience.  GWAPE is a Vermeer painting come to life. The cinematography was marvelous, but the editing and direction didn't live up to what could have been a more magical film about obsession, love,  beauty and art. Not that the film doesn't work, because it does...it just feels incomplete as a whole.  I ended watching the movie  wanting more out of the experience. All of this said, it  is still a gorgeous, worthwhile film... just one that isn't as great in the end as it should have been.  It won't go down as a great film, but there is a great film lurking somewhere inside it.

Colin Firth brings his considerable repertoire of talents as the enigmatic Johannes Vermeer and makes him a formidable figure with sparse dialogue. Scarlet is the perfect Greit.  Perhaps it is Scarlet Johanson's movie, and it may very well be.  But  Firth has the film in his own quiet and strong competent grasp. All the actors are outstanding...and this memorable movie is worthy to be seen again and again.

2007036,5,B0001K2L4W,"I can only repeat the observation made by other reviewers regarding ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"". Every scene of it is indeed a scene that Vermeer could have painted.
  Many details of Vermeer's life remain unknown, which gave author Tracy Chevalier a blank canvas on which to write a fictitious tale about the Dutch painter's life, and subsequently a blank canvas for director Peter Webber to recreate 17th Century Delft to perfection, from the canals in various seasons, to the blue and white of the town's famous tiles, amid a score that has been partially swiped from ""A Beautiful Mind"".
 The heroine of this story is a teenager named Griet--whose name, noticeably is a pet form of the name Maigriet, which means ""pearl"".
  Played with frequently appropriate silence by a full-lipped and perceptive looking Scarlett Johansson, whose white cap highlights the pastiness of her complexion, she is the daughter  of a disabled tile worker who must work as a maid to support her family, and in so doing, begins a road to immortality.
 The chief housekeeper, Tanneke (Johana Scanlan), who resembles a woman prominently featured in Vermeer's ""The Procuress"", initiates the young girl to her duties, but in an anticipatory moment, she prevents Griet from going to clean the master's studio because he is painting there, holding off unraveling the mystery about what face has been given to the Great Artist for just a little bit longer.
  Vermeer never painted his own portrait, except in one painting where only his back is visible, adding to his mystique. But as the actor who gives Vermeer a defineable face, Colin Firth is excellent, at turns explosive, amiable, and brooding as he helps bring out a young maid's latent talent for art appreciation, which she apparently inherited from her father.
 Everyone featured in the movie--from Judy Parfitt as his soberly clad mother-in-law, Essie Davis as his emotional and ever-pregnant wife, Catharina, to Griet's straw-haired, apple-cheeked butcher-boy suitor, Pieter(Cillian Murphy)-- is a character Vermeer could have painted, although with her curly red-gold hair, Alakina Mann as Vermeer's bratty daughter, Cornelia, might have captured the eye of another artist, Titian, had she lived in Italy a century earlier.
 We observe Griet as she goes about her daily tasks, and get a sense of her exploitable powerlessness, especially when she is confronted with the dishonorable conduct of Vermeer's patron, Van Ruijiven (Tom Wilkinson).
  But we see Griet's assertiveness and resolve at certain moments, as well as her discomfort in meeting certain demands her master makes of her. There is a lovely and tense moment when she removes her cap and hair the color of autumn leaves tumbles down her shoulders.
  After posing for Vermeer, a confused Griet rushes into a moment of passion with Pieter, perhaps to remind herself of her station and to relieve herself after having gone too far into the Great Painter's vortex.
 There is a final confrontation between Griet and her mistress after Catharina discovers the painting.
  But what a legacy! A close-up reveals the painting to have been made on wood rather than canvas. But it evokes thoughts about the mysterious girl against the black backdrop, leaving a viewer wondering about the real story behind the paintng, which  will most likely never be known.",1110672000,4,3346,5.128913443830571
2007037,4,B0001K2L4W,"I've read reviews complaining about the movie's adaptation of the book.  I absolutely loved both!  As Tracy Chevalier said before the release of the movie, ""[The book and movie] are like sisters rather than the same person, and complement each other rather than fight.""  No they aren't the same thing, and yes I question some of the things they removed from the book, but this movie is still great.

The casting was right on.  Colin Firth is absolutely amazing in his role just as Scarlett Johansson is.  Their chemistry is absolutely amazing.  Additionally this movie is beautifully shot with lovely costumes and scenery.  It made me look at the world differently for all of its complex colors.",1109548800,7,695,4.880341880341881
2007038,2,B0001K2L4W,"I HATE when this happens! You take a perfectly good story (in this case, Tracy Chevalier's ""Girl With a Pearl Earring""), and then the buffoons in Hollywood mess with it for no apparent reason and ruin what has the potential of being an excellent movie.

The reason I gave the film two stars is because two major aspects of the movie are dead on: the casting and the setting. The cast of this movie is absolutely perfect, and the visual elements of the film are exactly what I pictured when I was reading the book. However, the screenplay is a disaster. There are many small omissions from the book that make the movie confusing for people who aren't familiar with the story.  The scene where Griet and Vermeer are supposed to meet in Griet's parents' kitchen is completely omitted from the film, as is a basic explanation of why Griet is forced to go to work as a maid in the first place. Many scenes in the film are out of order, which completely destroys the main ideas that Chevalier outlined in her book. Griet's relationship with Pieter is depicted very differently in the film than in the book, and many of the other character relationships are skewed as well. And although Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth are flawless in their performances, I winced during the scene where Vermeer pierces Griet's ear in the movie...IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY IN THE BOOK, and there's a REASON it doesn't happen that way! I think the entire film completely jeopardized the integrity of the original novel, and there was no reason for it.

Perhaps the worst deviation from the novel occurs in the final minutes of the film: everything that happens from the moment Catharina discovers the painting of Griet is a complete fabrication. In the novel, Griet runs out of the house and is unsure of where she should go. Although she was never really sold on the idea of marrying the butcher's son, she realizes that he's her best chance for survival, and so she goes ahead with it. Ten years later, Tanneke visits Griet as she is working in the butcher shop and tells her that her mistress wishes to see her. Griet pays a visit to the Vermeer house for the first time in years. It has been several months since Vermeer has passed away, and Catharina informs Griet that her late husband has left her the pearl earrings in his will. Griet is obviously stunned, and she decides that she can't keep the earrings, so she sells them and gives the money to Pieter, telling him the Vermeers wanted to pay off their debt to the butcher shop. Now WHY did those Hollywood idiots rewrite the end of the movie so it didn't make any SENSE?! I'll never understand it.

""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is perfectly cast and is visually stunning, but the screenplay really sucks. I don't understand why the director felt the need to rearrange scenes from the book and omit little details that would have made the film less confusing to the audience. The movie is only an hour and a half long, so it's not like they were forced to edit things out because they were pressed for time. It seems like whoever wrote the screenplay merely skimmed through Chevalier's novel and wrote the draft for the movie in about an hour's time. What a disgrace. I wish they hadn't bothered to make the movie at all.",1108944000,20,3259,4.565811965811966
2007039,3,B0001K2L4W,"Let's start with the minus-points.

The movie is sometimes a little slow, and although that might serve some kind of artistic reason it doesn't always work well for the flow of the film. There are not a lot of words in this movie, making it more difficult to act, but the actors do a good job.

The best thing about this movie is the setting. It's almost like every scene is a Vermeer painting. You can recognize items from all his works scattered through the scenes. Even the outside takes are beautiful to look at. The range of colors used are magnificient and that alone makes this movie worth watching.",1108684800,,606,4.5
2007060,5,B0001K2L4W,"Oh, this movie pierced me to the very depths of my soul, like Vermeer in the movie pierces Griet's ear to wear the pearl earring for his painting !  This movie is a story about Love, not understood romantically, but in spiritual and emotional inter-subjectivity : being able to look into another person and understand (and feel) them fully and connect perfectly through that understanding (and ""sympathy"") : the very purpose and achievement of great art, like that which Vermeer makes of Griet.  Griet, a housemaid, the daughter of an injured (blinded and maimed) amateur painter, is at once for Jan Vermeer both the perfect model and the perfect critic (each role producing the perfection of the other)-- and this allows him to produce the masterwork of a painting, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"".  What more is there to say ?  This movie is to be felt with your eyes and understood with a vision that will happen in your soul.  WATCH IT, EVERYONE, AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THIS !  It is eminently a movie for men and women alike, for all sensitive people who are ""warriors of feeling"" and thereby ""true connoisseurs of art"".  And it will make you better understand those perfect artistic moments in life (where everything becomes transparent to us, and we see into the uttermost depths of something/someone else and ourselves), and it will utterly transform the way you look at art whether in galleries (you'll probably visit them more as a result) or on your own walls !  Again, I ask, what more is there to say (what more could be said ?) for a movie, a work of art ?!  Only this : there is no gratuitousness in this movie.  The concluding sex scene is absolutely necessary and absolutely perfect, and it touched (and radically transformed) my understanding and appreciation of sex, from a woman's perspective.  Griet is a tragic figure, a woman of very low social standing, caught in a man's world, who has failed her parents in being evicted as a servant from Vermeer's household.  She knows not how to live her life now (how to support her parents : which new household will take her in as a servant when she will become so instantaneously recognizable for having posed for such a masterwork of a painting ?).  She knows too, as the attempted rape by Vermeer's patron, van Ruijven, makes plain, that her beauty will cause her to be ""bumped on"" by other ""men"".  Only two people in her life, Vermeer and her boyfriend/wannabe husband, Pieter, respect and love and see into her.  Her virginity will be robbed from her by all other ""men"".  To Pieter (whom she can never marry, she must wander the world to find herself) she can give a final, tender parting gift : in this way, her ""first time"" is HERS, and remains a gift freely given away, in Love.  And so, the sex scene.  I love great sex scenes and this is such a one.  You will not forget it.  YOU WILL NOT FORGET THIS MOVIE.

2007061,5,B0001K2L4W,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen that uses an art theme, here in a fictitious but plausible plot based on Tracy Chevalier's bestselling novel using one of Vermeer's most loved paintings as a central plot device.

The detail in the film is exceptional, from the exquisite light that reminds us of Vermeer's work, to the costumes and set design, the atmosphere of 17th century Delft, where one can almost smell the stench from the canal where all the refuse is dumped, to Griet's hands, which look as if they have scrubbed many a cold, tile floor.

Best of all is the mixing of the paint and glazes, done from stones, oils and many exotic materials, all in graceful containers.

After many cast and director shifts, the final roster that was chosen is superb, and fate must have waited for just the right mix of actors and director, for one cannot imagine it better. Scarlett Johansson is excellent in the almost mute part of Griet, and Colin Firth is a manly and terrific Vermeer. Especially good is Essie Davis as Vermeer's needy wife Catherina, who knows she will never become a part of her adored husband's world, a world she doesn't understand or inspire.

The melodic score by Alexandre Desplat, cinematography by the great Eduardo Serra, and directorial skills of Peter Webber all contribute to making this film a gem, one that as an artist I appreciate for its portrayal of Vermeer, and those glimpses into some of his rare (only 35 of his pieces are known) paintings, especially that enigmatic girl, wearing the now famous pearl earring.

DVD extras include a music video (not sure what the relevance to the film is, other than it has Johansson in it), and a Sundance Channel production of the making of the film, centering on the set design and its authenticity.

As usual Colin Firth delivers, and though I'm not a big fan of Scarlett Johannson, she surprised me in this film.

I'm not quite sure what the purpose of Cornelia was, besides being an unbearable brat. Maybe I'll read the book as well and find out more?",1107561600,2,499,4.472527472527473
2007063,3,B0001K2L4W,"A romanticized story with probably little truth to the plot. Nevertheless, Vermeer's famous painting, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is beautiful enough to create a hit movie, regardless of the plot. It's like having Greta Garbo come alive to star in a brand new version of ""Anna Karenina"". A film like that can't fail, and neither can a story about Vermeer's most famous portrait. In the painting, ""Girl with a Pearl Earraing"", an unknown young woman, probably a girl from Delft, Holland where Vermeer lived, sits for her portrait in a pose looking over her shoulder. Her head is wrapped in a stylish headdress. In the ear facing the painter she wears a beautiful pearl drop earring. Actually, this portrait is very stylish, even 400 years after it was first painted by world famous ""Dutch Master"", Johannes Vermeer, sometime between 1660-1665.

In the movie (adapted from the novel by Tracy Chevalier), the young servant girl, named Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is a maid in Vermeer's house. Actually, the Vermeer house is his mother-in-law's home in Delft, Holland. Vermeer lost the family's home he inherited due to bankruptcy. Also, Vermeer was born a Protestant but he converted to Catholicism before marrying his wife, Catharina (Essie Davis). Vermeer and Catharina and their dozen or so children moved in with mother-in-law, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt) when they needed a place to live. At least this much of the movie's plot is reasonably accurate. Although Vermeer is known as a master painter today and his work is priceless, he was considered a tradesman during his lifetime. He was a man who painted pictures with no particular fan-fare.

In the film, Griet is serenely too beautiful for Vermeer and his sleazy patron Master van Ruijven (Tim Wilkinson) to resist. In movie publicist language, ""beauty inspires obsession"".  Ahhh, a stretch, in my opinion. Truthfully, the movie is about the explosive tensions aroused when attractions cross social class. Vermeer was not supposed to paint a young servant girl while alone with her - especially if she's wearing his wife's pearl drop earrings. There's supposed to be something sexy about the necessary intimacy between a painter and subject.  Who'd-a-thought the pretty girl in Vermeer's famous portrait, who was only trying to earn a meager living housecleaning, could create sexual attractions from nearly every person she meets while just doing her job?  Vermeer is compelled to seek her out for the way she attracts light and how she dedicates herself to making him a better painter. Vermeer's seedy patron Raijven seems driven to own the painting for pornographic intentions. To find her own sexual release, poor Griet tries to maintain a smokescreen relationship with a local young butcher, a man who lives in her own social class and shares her Protestant religion. Secrecy and sexual tension drives Vermeer's selfish wife Catharina into uncontrolled jealous rage. Meanwhile, mother-in-law Thins tries to figure out how to keep her son-in-law employed. She needs Vermeer to earn a decent living while housing his tribe of spoiled kids and jealous wife (her daughter) under her roof.  ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" should be touted as an art appreciation soap opera. Vermeer's paintings became famous and priceless in the late 19th century, over 200 years after he died in 1675. ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" movie (DVD) and book undoubtedly adds even more value to this already priceless work of art.",1106956800,3,3458,5.111504424778761

Director Peter Webber transports us back to 17th century Holland, into the family of Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer  (Colin Firth), where the desperate need for commissions from their patron (Tom Wilkinson) exposes emotions and conflicts that the unwilling family members would rather keep deeply hidden. When a new maid (Scarlett Johansson) arrives, jealously, possession and control spin the family out of control, while simultaneously prying open the clams of our subconscious, exposing our deepest fears -- the pearls we too secretly try to keep deeply hidden. Like all great directors, Webber tells us nothing, but with wonderful dialogue and photography exposes us to a fascinating world of art and dependence.",1105833600,4,848,5.281481481481482
2007065,5,B0001K2L4W,"Hats off to the director and cinematographer who managed to make nearly every frame of GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING look like a painting by Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), the artist subject of the movie who seems trapped in a world of patronage and marital relations. While fortunate, in the seventeenth century, to enjoy a relatively comfortable life selling his paintings to a lecherous patron, Vermeer seems imprisoned in his attic studio. And then along comes Griet (Scarlett Johansson) who, as a nubile maid, enters the Vermeer household and discovers talents for composition and color and thus attracts the eye of the genius painter Vermeer who may be bored with his beautiful but shallow and spoiled upper class wife. One is struck by how great Vermeer's talent was and yet how under appreciated he must have been if the film's making him so dependent on a single patron is historically accurate. Vermeer's ability to capture light and color is reflected in the scenes of the film which show us Dutch life at home or marketplace in the 1600's about as realistic as you can get without having actors squatting over chamber pots. With all the hard manual work (no washing machines), it makes the movie-goer glad we didn't live four centuries ago. While there isn't much plot to THE GIRL WITH THE PEARL EARRING and things move slowly in the film,  the visual beauty of the film lingers and touches the viewer, especially the beauty of Scarlett Johansson. I didn't detect a false step in the script or the direction of THE GIRL WITH THE PEARL EARRING. How can you not like this film? Bravo!

Like the Red Violin, this film gives you an appreciation for the object of art by going behind the scenes to its origins.  The set and costumes are appropriate for the period, similar to the paintings of the times in color and tone.  The acting by Scarlet Johansson as the Dutch servant girl who becomes the muse to Colin Firth's artist is subtle, but powerful.

Not many critics, however, seem to mention or notice that beauty lies not only in the scenery, but also in the plot. Maybe the reason I find the plot so clear and so appealing is that I read the book by Tracy Chevalier before I watched the movie. They are slightly different, but for the most part, the overall feeling is captured from book to movie and from movie to book.
This movie basically covers the realtionship Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer develops with his newly hired maid, who not only cleans his study, but also shares with him a passion and understanding for his work that his very wife cannot comprehend. He is not so much obssessed with Griet as he is captivated by the fact that she seems to just get him. It is this feeling that is meant to fuel the whole movie, but for some people it just doesn't. And I guess that's understandable. After all, it is a strange happening, a relationship that was unusual back then and that would still be unusual now, not because a master is getting on with his maid, but because he isn't.",1103328000,2,1199,4.454545454545454

2007080,5,B0001K2L4W,"If you don't know much about painting, or Verneer for that matter, you don't have to worry.  'Girl with a Pearl Earring' is not about the painting of the title itself; the film is rather a romance behind the (much fictional) account of the making of the painting, or the forbidden relation between a man and a girl.  As such, it is stunning, so are the actors, especially Scarlet Johanssen.

The simple story begins with a girl Griet perfectly played by New-York-State born Johanssen.  Living in Holland, 1665 (around the time the painting is supposed to be made), Griet now has to work at the painter Verneer's house as maid, and as you may expect, the menial jobs only make the life there very drab.

But the painter himself, rather strange, and laconic guy Verneer (Colin Firth, with long hair), is not a bad master.  By the time she understands that, she actually becomes the only person who in turn understands the importance of his work in the entire household of his.  And the painter, whose wife just don't understand, and who is surrounded by many (more than 10) kids, also finds a solace in her....

The film could be more melodramatic, and some part almost become so (the theatrical portrait of Tom Wilkinson's greedy patron nearly did it), but thanks largely to the subtle lighting of photographer Eduardo Serra (known for Patrice Leconte films) and very credible production designs by Ben Van Oz (known for Peter Greenaway films), the film itself becomes a Vermeer painting itself.  The story, relying on less dialogues than other costume films, manages to be engaging and involving, with the superb acting from the two leads.

But the greatest thing happens at the ending, which is inspired by the original painting.  How to end a film is one of the trickiest parts of the job, and 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' ends with a very clever, and also beautiful way.  It still remains with me.

Some may call the film predictable, but that is a minor thing.  As a costume drama this film is first-rate, but first and foremost it is a romance with a heart, the very universal theme.",1100822400,13,2087,4.682191780821918
2007081,3,B0001K2L4W,"For anyone who loves 17th-century Flemish painting, as I do, ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"" is visually breathtaking. The filmmakers expertly captured the soft, diffuse light that permeates paintings of the era. The film also captures the otherworldly look of Dutch costumes of the period as well, with their panoply of white lace, starched headgear and pointy ""Pilgrim"" hats. It was amazing to watch street scenes populated by characters for whom such bizarre outfits were considered everyday clothing. If the films were judged solely on costuming and atmosphere, this film would be an instant classic.

The film's flaws are with its characters. I haven't read the book, so I'm not aware of plot changes, but some things just didn't work for me. Scarlett Johansson bears an uncanny resemblance to the girl who modeled for the painting, but I think the filmmakers got her personality wrong. The girl in the painting exudes a sly, sensuous sense of confidence, whereas Johansson plays her as timid, repressed and even fearful. This difference is made painfully apparent at the end of the film when a close-up a Johansson dissolves into Vermeer's actual painting.

I should have been paying attention to the story -- the illicit fascination of Vermeer (Colin Firth) for his young maid. But the best parts of the movie were about the effects of hand-laundering during winter, about the process of grinding pigments to make paint, about the process of painting and about the effect of afternoon light on Dutch interiors. The movie moves slowly too, as thought rh filmmakers were attempting to portray temporally the airiness and languor of the architecture.

All in all, a movie in which there's much less than meets the eye.",1100822400,2,1724,5.042105263157895
2007082,5,B0001K2L4W,"A film by Peter Webber

Have you ever looked at a painting and wondered who sat for the portrait and what her story may be?  Or what the inspiration behind a particular painting was?  Tracy Chevalier apparently has because four of her novels have dealt with this very idea.  Her most popular novel was ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"", which looks into one possible origin for the famous Vermeer painting of the same name.  Peter Webber's 2003 film ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is an adaptation of Chevalier's bestselling novel.

Griet (Scarlet Johansson) is a young Dutch girl living in the 1600's.  Her family is poor, so she is hired as a maid in the household of the painter, Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth).  This is a very big opportunity for her, though she is viewed with suspicion by Vermeer's wife because he has been indiscreet with the maids in the past.  Griet is a quiet girl and is assigned the basic drudge work of cleaning.  When she is cleaning Vermeer's studio, being careful not to move anything, Master Vermeer notices her, permits her to continue to work while he is around, and eventually permits Griet to help him.  Helping Vermeer means, at various times, mixing paint and posing for portraits to be used as a guide to help Vermeer paint.  From this develops a bond between Griet and Vermeer (or perhaps it happens because of the bond), and Griet ultimately becomes the subject of Vermeer's famous and somewhat mysterious painting.

""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" can almost be described as a silent film.  Griet has very little dialogue, but Scarlet Johansson is able to portray Griet so well that she is a compelling character even without dialogue.  Johansson's acting is such that without speaking we are being told a story and being given characterization.  Besides Johansson's work, the other main point of note is simply how beautiful this movie is.  To make an overly obvious comparison, it is like a painting.  This makes sense since the movie is about a particular painting as well as being partly inside the world of Vermeer and art.  To be honest, little needs to be said during ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and the film does not suffer for it.

Given Vermeer's past history with the family's maids, and given Griet's beauty (she is pursued also by the butcher's son as well as Vermeer's patron); there is a suspicion of impropriety between Griet and Vermeer.  The movie suggests that there might be more to the relationship, and the household believes it, but there is certainly a level of attraction between Griet and Vermeer.  It is very understated, but with looks and visual suggestion and maybe even the lack of dialogue helps foster this impression.

Scarlet Johansson was nominated for two Golden Globes in 2003 for her work in ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"".  Many feel that ""Lost in Translation"" was her stronger work and that she had deserved to be nominated for an Academy Award.  I agree that she should have been nominated, but for ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"".  Here she is being asked to carry the movie with very little dialogue.  This film, outside of some critical attention, has been very overlooked.  The quiet nature of ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" may be off-putting to some, but this is a very good movie and one well worth the time for those with the patience (or interest) to give it a shot.

2007083,5,B0001K2L4W,"This movie, like Tracy Chevalier's book, is an amazing study of contrasts. The lighting crew for this film did an exceptional job of making it truly appear as if the world was only lit by the sun and candles. Unlike many period pieces, the film actually seems like what it might have been like in Vermeer's time.

The plot is a slow burn, with the tension nearly palpable between the characters. The cool, blonde fragility of Griet is a striking contrast to the fiery Mrs. Vermeer. Griet's youth and simplicity balances against Vermeer's jaded brooding. The blindness of Griet's beloved father is opposed by the ability of her beloved Vermeer to see in impossible detail.

I thought this was an excellent adaptation of the novel, as well as esthetically pleasing and very well cast. This movie is not, however, for people who like a fast pace, lots of action or dialogue. I enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who has pondered Vermeer's gorgeous paintings.",1099008000,4,974,4.791666666666667

I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and I would rather this movie be seen in a manner where we got to absorb the backgrounds, the society of Vermeer's time.  DVD was a more worthy tool to watch this movie as we were able to know the dedication of the crew in filming this movie in extreme temperature (minus 15 Celsius) just to be faithful to the book, the time and effort spent in producing close to accurate portrayal of Vermeer's time, how to bring the fictitious book constructively into the movie setting.  Performance from all parties were top-notch and through research, it's now been said that it's more probable that the girl with the pearl ear ring could be Vermeer's own daughter as he relished his time painting domestic scenes.  Still, credit still went to the author for having such a credible fictitious mind to suggest quite a domestic thriller that was captivating to watch as much as to learn about Vermeer's world in the 17th century.  For art's enthusiasts, this is something that you shouldn't miss.  It's quite incredible to watch this movie, really.",1098489600,8,1321,4.688311688311688

The actors are reduced to standing around without expression in period garb.

I liked the reproduction of a Dutch town with its dreary winter weather and it's conformity and modesty of female garb.  Greit is lusty enough with her butcher boyfriend, but the love of her life, the great Vermeer, this doesn't get off the ground though there be much tormented bosom heaving. Colin Firth had the same facial expression of constipation in Bridget Jones Diary.

2007086,5,B0001K2L4W,"Johannes Vermeer is now considered to be one of the great Dutch master-painters. But shortly after his death in 1675, his work was all but forgotten. It wasn't until the late 19th century that his astonishing stroke was once more familiar in the psyche of art historians the world over, despite only a fraction of his paintings still existing.

I hardly consider myself to be much of an art scholar, but I must say Vermeer's artwork has always caught my eye. His stellar proficiency in capturing not only space and composition, but also the intangible, has long snared a parcel of intrigue in my mind.

Sure, Vermeer was extraordinary at casting everything visible to the naked eye to canvas, but I am more impressed with his ability to capture allegory and inner radiance in his oil productions. Iconography is the word I seek. In fact, there is one Vermeer painting that to this day nearly moves me to tears for this reason. The magnum opus is aptly referred to as ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" the focal point of the motion picture by the same title.

""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" is a gloriously photographed fictional account of Vermeer (Colin Firth) and his infamous subject (Scarlett Johansson). Adapted from the novel by Tracy Chevalier, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" it marks Peter Webber's filmmaking debut.

Although admittedly slow - audible snoozing was evident in the theater - the film glimmers with breathtaking beauty. Every shot is a virtual representation of a Vermeer painting.

Besides the astounding photography, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" acts as a flawless period piece. The costuming, set design and dialogue are all perfect. It truly feels as though the spectator is whisked away to 17th century Holland.

The acting is phenomenal. Truth be told, it troubles me that Johansson was shunned by the Academy for her role as a bashful, yet strong-willed maid providing for Master Vermeer and his materialistic spouse.

Tom Wilkinson also puts forth a stunning performance as the artist's chief benefactor. In those days, it was customary for the artists to thank their benefactors with a feast. One wonders if he backs Vermeer out of appreciation for his art or out of his desire for a hearty meal.

In addition, the forbidden romance shared between Vermeer and the simple-minded chambermaid is one of outright resplendence. Vermeer's wife fails to gather the implications of his craft, but it is the maid that fully understands the significance of every layer, every square millimeter, of paint that coats the canvas. When Vermeer asks her to describe the color of the clouds, she at first says white. Then, on second glance, the colors yellow, blue and gray roll off her tongue.

We have no way of knowing for sure whether such an affair ever took place, as little is known of Vermeer's life. But in his work ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" Vermeer casts the subject in such a gloriously pristine light that surely the model meant something to the painter.",1096243200,5,2975,4.886904761904762
2007087,5,B0001K2L4W,"Girl with a Pearl Earring is a brilliant cinematic depiction of Johannes Vermeer's ambiguous painting with the same name.  The ambiguity is obvious when the story unfolds as there are so many missed moments where words where not exchanged, actions were not taken, and feelings not expressed.  These moments are the very essence of the film as they set the audience free in an artistic environment that encourages cerebral participation.

Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is sent away from home to work for the Vermeer as a maid.  The Vermeer can afford luxuries and maids through Johannes Vermeer's (Colin Firth), a Dutch painter in the mid-1600s, paintings that are usually ordered.  Johannes lives with his wife and children under his mother-in-laws strict rule, which seems to suffocate Johannes artistically.  However, Griet's presence appears to cheer up Johannes as his artistic drought suddenly seems to have faced a monsoon of creativity.

Johannes discovers that Griet is an untapped well of artistic talent as she begins to mix his colors with extraordinary detail for hue, tint, and shade.  The paint mixing becomes an allegorical symbol how the two unite without truly expressing feelings for one another.  A connection between Griet and Johannes is unthinkable as several factors meddle between them such as the mother-in-law's iron fist, Johannes wife's vivid insecurity, and the daughter's envy.

The director Peter Webber grabs the audience with the same subtle force that Vermeer's paintings seize the viewer.  Vermeer's paintings trigger the audience's curiosity through the expressed uncertainty which seemingly hides some secrets that demand answers.  These answers are left for the audience to ponder as the film is highly introspective, and is delivered with a painters gentle touch.",1095897600,3,1799,5.408602150537634

Like the book, the film is also a lesson about art.  In a very direct way we learn about mixing paint and looking for good light and the art of composition. And it's also the story of the painter, Johannes Vermeer, played by Colin firth, and his model, Griet, played by Scarlett Johansson.

Of course I never lived in the world of 17th century Holland.  But the film feels so authentic that it makes me think I did.  I get an excellent sense of how it must have been then, a center of the artistic world, in which an inflexible class structure kept the servant class and the upper class severely apart. One of the things I liked about the story was that it kept the relationship between the painter and the servant girl strictly within the limits of the culture.  They do not have a romance in the usual sense of the word.  However, they were both sensitive to artistic composition, and they connected in that way.  Vermeer was married with a houseful of children, a wife who was continually pregnant, and an overbearing mother-in-law.  Griet was a young servant with a natural wisdom.  How this all played out is the author's imagination, of course.  But it is a good story.

This is a quiet film.  It moves slowly and with purpose.  And, along the way, we learn about mixing paints and the business of art and the differences in the quality of light.

2007111,3,B0001K2L4W,"This film is cinematically stunning and makes an impact in subtle ways just as the book did, but offers a few alterations to the original novel.

The story involves a young maid (Scarlett Johansson) who is employed to work for the family of painter Vermeer (Colin Firth) in Holland during the 17th century. Instilled within Griet, the young maid, is sensitivity to art which she received from her father who was once an artistic tile maker until blinded in an accident. Griet is sent to work for the Vermeer's because her family no longer has a breadwinner to support their expenses. She toils about in her new job unable to really fit in with the children of the family or the other maid. Her love of color and art draws the attention of the house master, Johannes Vermeer, and she is soon his unofficial assistant. Vermeer is entranced by Griet because in his own wife (Essie Davis) and mother in law (Judy Parfitt) he is seen as merely a commodity to maintain their aristocratic lifestyle. Vermeer struggles to matter and bonds with Griet. Needless to say the story becomes complex and ends with the power and beauty of a little pearl earring.

Johansson is perfectly cast as the young woman depicted in Vermeer's famous painting, ""Girl With a Pearl Earring,"" and the masterpiece is brought to life when she poses for the painting in this film. Colin Firth plays Vermeer in a troubled sense, restless and alone in his art while bowing to subjects in order to make a living for his ever growing family. Firth is both distant and intimate in his role with few lines but great intensity. The role of Vermeer's jealous wife, Catharina, is played with excellence by the luminous Essie Davis. Other mentions are Judy Parfitt who plays the controlling mother in law and Tom Wilkinson who portrays Master Van Ruijven with expert creepiness. The scenes are beautifully shot and bring the gray chill of Holland in 1664 to life with great effect all intermingled of course with Vermeer's fantastic art.

My only complaint with this film is that the story does not follow the book in the end. It is not incomplete but will seem so if you read the novel first. Either way I feel it is well worth the viewing but don't forget to read the novel by Tracy Chevalier as well.

It's been called the ""Mona Lisa of the North,"" and it's the kind of painting you can sit in front of for hours. This film, and Tracy Chevalier's novel on which it was based, is a fictional exploration of the young model, a maid in Vermeer's house, who slowly, quietly falls in love with her master, helps him grind his pigments, tries to survive the jealousy of his misunderstanding wife, and becomes the sexual target of Vermeer's wealthy patron (who must be placated if the artist's family is to survive). Scarlett Johansson is not a great actress, but she's perfect for this part. She seems made to wear the linen cap and homespun dress. She doesn't have that many lines -- indeed, there's relatively little dialogue at all in this film -- but she communicates beautifully with expression and gesture and posture.

2007115,4,B0001K2L4W,"Introspective and ambiguous are the work of the brilliant 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. So little is known of his life that in translating it to the screen in the fictional account, The Girl With a Pearl Earring, the film at times seems equally filled with blank spaces. The story of a lowly scullery maid, Griet (Scarlett Johanson) whose family must send her to work in the chaotic and expanding Catholic family of the painter, Vermeer is stage for the drama of too many hens, too few roosters. Status and riches are the concerns of all who surround Vermeer including his shrewish but beautiful, vacuous wife and her ambitious, manipulative mother (Judy Parfit). While the lecherous attentions of Tom Wilkinson's character, a bourgeois patron whose purse forgives his boorish manners adds insult to the beauty of his Vermeer collection.

Colin Firth as Vermeer is a posterboy for the passive-aggressive husband, loath to most of his household until Griet catches his attention by her ability to recognize the elements which motivate the painter -- quiet, and good color sense. This is not an overwhelming art film in the sense of angst, a la Van Gough, but it suggests Vermeer was motivated by something more than light and domestic interiors. As Firth presents the painter, he is a pawn between duty to provide for his always growing family, and his desire for someone to understand his attention to detail, color, and composition which Griet, in her silences seems to provide. While the quietness of both servant girl and painter infuriate some, it is the space provided by their quietness that is the most productive. Everything around the couple is cacophony except in the studio where the only sound that enters are the muffled noises below the floor.

As Griet, Scarlett Johanson is compared visually to the sublime painting, but has little resemblance to the actual model who looks more like the French actress, Julie Delpy than Johanson. She is only competent in the role of tentative servant without conviction in several scenes where she is put upon by her betters. While Griet slaps the face of daughter, Cornellia, an evil brat whose own story -- the Bad Seed -- was yet to be written; Johanson often seems overwhelmed how to portray the passivity a maid in her situation was required. She simply displays deadpan for every emotion. Perhaps it is the Americanness of Johanson that shines through, but one half expects her to snap her gum and blast rap music from her iPod while cleaning Vermeers studio. She is simply too modern in her body movements to convey the 17th century with believability.

What wins the film is the stunning cinematography that lights the dim house setting with scene after scene taken from Vermeer works. It is the catalyst that permits audiences to set aside the irritating street scenes with butcherboy (Cillian Murphy) to await with anticipation for the next views of exquisite shots of domestic scenery. It appears as if Vermeer had lit the film himself. If he had, could a film look any better? Overlook Johanson and enjoy the peace and view.",1091232000,3,3102,4.927342256214149

The movie is slow-paced and suttle but it quietly leads you through a beautiful visual story of love and infatuation.

The Academy nominated the film for all the fine things about it; Art Direction, Cinematography, and Costume Design, all places in which the movie excelled. Granted, when you have in front of you an adaptation of a book as visually conceived as Girl with a Pearl Earring, you've got a headstart on the rest of the pack. That said, Eduardo Serra (previously nominated for the Wings of the Dove, and who has also shown his talent on such brilliantly photographed films as Unbreakable, What Dreams May Come, and The Widow of St. Pierre) was the perfect choice to complement the script, and nailed the final pieces of the film's Oscarworthy bits into place.

The Golden Globes, on the other hand, nominated the film for Best Score (Alexandre Desplat's music is so horribly derivative that at times I thought I was watching other movies) and Best Actress. For what, exactly? Scarlett Johansson is a fine actress, when she wants to be (Lost in Translation, The Man Who Wasn't There), but she has so very little to work with here that she seems wasted in the role.

The film, which (purportedly) details Chevalier's flight of fantasy on the genesis of Vermeer's famous painting, commits the double-edged sin of both condensing the book to an excruciating level, and then changing what it's condensed; had they stopped with the gratuitous additions and kept closer to the source material, they might have had a decent film. As it is, it's something of a mess. I've read the book (made my top ten that year, in fact), and I was still lost in places. I shudder to think what happened to those unfamiliar with the source material, though perhaps the changes didn't jar quite as much.

In the face of all the awful things about the movie, I should mention that Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom, The Patriot, etc.), Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later...), and the wonderful Judy Parfitt (Ever After, Wilde, the upcoming Asylum, and many other criminally-neglected flicks) all turn in wonderful performances in relatively minor roles. They make the washed-out natures of both the roles of Johansson and Colin Firth (The Importance of Being Earnest, Valmont, and other unintentionally humorous period pieces) all the more pale.

A very pretty film, to be sure. But I'm not sure whether those who've read the book first (so they have half an idea what's going on) or those who haven't (blissful in their ignorance) would be a better audience for this. Sometimes pretty is enough; this time it wasn't. **",1090800000,6,2746,4.8195329087048835

And the scene with Vermeer and her mixing paints and they almost hold hands....wow!  This is one of the most erotic films I have ever seen.  Very subtle.  For those that think this a boring film there is nothing to explain to them.  I cannot justify this film; all I can say is that it is beautiful and I love it.  p.s. I have to admire the business sense of the mother-in-law.",1090800000,,518,4.12
2007131,3,B0001K2L4W,"Behind every picture there lies a story, and the film ?Girl With a Pearl Earring? purports to give us the inside scoop into the making of Vermeer?s classic painting of the same name.  In the mid 1600?s, a young, illiterate peasant girl named Griet came to live and work as a servant in the home of the promising, yet still financially struggling, Dutch master.  Obsessed by her beauty, Vermeer insisted on using her as the subject for one of his works, much to the horror and chagrin of his jealous and shrewish wife.  Despite the domestic havoc it caused, the collaboration between artist and subject resulted in one of the genuine masterpieces of the art world.

Visually, this film could not be more stunning.  Thanks to luminous cinematography, art direction and costume design, the audience watching this film feels almost as if it has been transported into a Vermeer work.  Director Peter Webber recreates every element of that world in loving detail, right down to his choice of actress Scarlett Johansson, who is a dead ringer for the model in the original portrait.  Alexandre Desplat?s score also captures the lyrical, haunting tenderness of the subject matter.

?Girl With a Pearl Earring? is a very fine movie in many respects, but it is ultimately unsatisfying because it cannot match in content what it achieves in style.  Despite the exquisite look of the film, the characters seem strangely underdeveloped, most especially Vermeer himself, who remains frustratingly superficial throughout.  Thanks mainly to his taciturn moodiness, we never get to know much of what he is thinking or feeling.  The romantic moments between artist and subject are admirably restrained ? and thereby all the more erotic in nature ? but we do feel as if we would like to know more about him as a person.  Griet is only slightly more fully developed, although, in her case, we can at least ascribe this lack of information to the restrictions placed on her by her station in life and the society of her time.  Unlike Vermeer, Griet was conditioned by the world around her to be a passive observer.  But Vermeer needs to be a more dynamic presence in the story.

One admires the fact that the filmmakers have remained truthful to the spirit of the enterprise, refusing to indulge in cheap melodramatics to make the story more salacious and scandalous than in truth it really was.  Yet, in dramatic terms, such integrity comes with a price, for the film often has the effect of lulling rather than stimulating us, of raising our expectations then failing to fully satisfy them.  Perhaps, in the case of this particular artwork, the story-behind-the-picture wasn?t really all that interesting to begin with.",1090281600,3,2699,4.922737306843267

First off I just loved how the movie was filmed. It made me really sucked into a big glimpse how the 1600's was like. The art direction, cinematography, and the costume designs were marvelous and deserved to be nominated for the Oscars in those categories. The music was enchanting which made the movie even more beautiful. Last but certainly not least I loved the acting too. Scarlett Johansson played a very polished performance and Colin Firth did a wonderful job as the mysterious painter. Love it! Love it! The only thing I will criticize with the DVD is the bonus materials. There isn't enough there. Only two things! But otherwise, this was an EXCELLENT movie. Watch it!",1090022400,,816,4.835714285714285
2007133,5,B0001K2L4W,"Watching ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" is like walking into one of Johannes Vermeer's exquisite paintings. Eduardo Serra's cinematography is brilliant and captures, remarkably, the luminescent quality of light in Delft - the same light which Vermeer so skillfully put to use in his masterpieces. Serra's visuals give us a glimpse of what Holland must have been like in 1665. Through Director Peter Webber's camera we view scenes as if they are painted on canvas - the shimmer of silk cloth, of water in the canals, of the sun on snow; the haze of sunlight through clouds, light through a window; the brilliance of color contrasted with dark shadows; scenes as beautifully composed as a great painting. Daylight, candle and shadow are used dramatically. The atmosphere is as rich as an artist's palette.
Not much is known about the Dutch master, who lived and worked in 17th century Delft. Only 35 of his paintings survive. Among these works, perhaps his greatest, is the portrait, ""Girl With A Pearl Earring."" Director Webber has transformed Tracy Chevalier's novel, of the same name, into this extraordinary movie for the big screen.
Scarlett Johansson is superb as the young servant girl, Griet, who is sent to the Vermeer household to work after her father has an incapacitating accident. The labor is pure drudgery and seemingly endless, with little pay and fewer thanks. Since the Vermeers are dependent on wealthy patrons to commission paintings, money is tight and Vermeer's young wife is pregnant almost every year. Griet's work is made more difficult by jealous coworkers, the brood of spoiled Vermeer children, the suspicious wife and her manipulating mother, (Essie Davis), who holds the purse strings tightly.
Griet's unusual intelligence begins to show, as does her curiosity and sensitivity. She is fascinated by Vermeer's work and the world of light and color. She wonders, at one point, whether to wash the murky studio windows and risk losing the precious quality of muted light. This is not just an ordinary maid. She has a quality of stillness and purity about her which attracts Vermeer, (Colin Firth is wonderful as the brooding artist), as well as his super rich, lecherous patron, (Tom Wilkinson). Eventually, Griet is pressured to sit for a portrait, which will, centuries later, be marveled at.
The production design and period settings are award-worthy. Olivia Hetreed's screenplay is excellent. She places as much emphasis on silence as she does on dialogue and the result is extremely effective. And the cast is exceptional. Johansson's and Firth's performances are nuanced and subtle.
Vermeer is one of my favorite artists and I have traveled far to see his available work. I watched ""Girl With A Pearl Earring""  twice in as many days. It is a wonderful movie and an extraordinary visual experience. A must see!

2007134,4,B0001K2L4W,"This film was nominated for three academy awards: Art Direction, Costume Design, and Cinematography. Unfortunately for it, The Return of the King, and Master & Commander, were also nominated for those categories. Stiff competition.
Mind you, this film was a marvelous evocation of its period and of Delft (they actually filmed there, amongst other places), from the cutting of the vegetables in the opening scene to the vividly and beautifully painted interior lid of the harpsichord played by Vermeer's mostly unhappy wife. We even have a powerful sense of smell, from Griet's rejection of the meat for not being fresh, to the dumping of garbage into the river (street) outside their home. This is where the movie succeeded brilliantly - in sensory images. And that's appropriate, as the movie is about one of the greatest works of art by one of the world's greatest artists.
Scarlet Johansson once again plays the role of a younger woman whose fate is entwined with an older man, but - and sorry to all of you fans of Lost in Translation - this is simply a better, more believable film. Her character, Griet, is a poor girl sent to work in the home of Vermeer, and from the moment she sets foot into Vermeer's studio (to clean it, of course) you can sense her relation to his work. The very first indication we get of this is when she asks Vermeer's wife if she should clean the windows. The wife has no idea why this should be important, but when Griet informs her that it would affect the lighting, Vermeer's wife says yes, of course. We see that Vermeer has a wife and mother-in-law who care nothing for his art, who see him as a meal ticket. Here he is seen as almost maddeningly misunderstood, and although allusions are drawn to perhaps a previous indiscretion with a serving girl, it is Griet's character who understands him. Indeed, she took it upon herself to move a chair away from the set of one of his paintings, and explained later that it appeared to be blocking her (ostensibly, Griet, for the painting was inspired by her cleaning of the studio windows) in. We see that immediately after this, Vermeer paints the chair out of the picture.
However, there were flaws. Griet's ""love interest"", Pieter, has at most ten minutes of screen time. I was perplexed at his inclusion, and could only guess that he existed for one reason: that when Griet felt sexual tension occurring between her and Vermeer, she instead ran to Pieter. Whatever her reasons for that were, she kept them quiet. Her dialogue was limited to very few lines, and she communicated mostly through her eyes. Perhaps this was done on purpose, to call to mind the painting that gives the film its name. Unfortunately, in a film, more communication is necessary than in a painting. I would have liked to see her character more interactive. But that's just my tiny, humble opinion.
As a side note, for anyone interested in young adult books, an excellent book was just released, Chasing Vermeer, which is available here on amazon.com. It's kind of a Da Vinci Code for kids, and although it's for young adults, the scholarship on Vermeer is top notch.",1089676800,2,3127,4.718464351005484
2007135,4,B0001K2L4W,"""Girl With the Pearl Earring"" is a great film release of 2003, starring Scarlett Johannson, Colin Firth, and Tom Wilkinson.  It received two Oscar nominations: Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.  It explores the making of Johannes Vermeer's painting of the same name.  It shares why it was so controversial during the time and why it was so dangerous to paint.  Meanwhile, the life of the girl in the painting, Griet, becomes the biggest emotional aspect.  Though the plot moves too slow occasionally, this film is great for most audiences.  Its mixture of drama, romance, and danger keeps audiences interested.  Behind the chain of events, the characters' emotional elements of the times remain throughout the movie.  Though all actors portray their roles wonderfully, Scarlett Johannson's Golden Globe nominated role as Griet stands out.  This is one in two movies released in 2003 (also ""Lost In Translation"") that launched her career.  She proves in this film that her best is yet to come.
The physical backgrounds wonderfully blend with Vermeer's art style and Holland's 17th century style, including the setting, the costumes, and the make-up.  The research behind the era presents itself greatly.  The details also deeply explore the motives behind his art style.  Such elaborate quality offers added viewing pleasure.  His paintings were beautifully remastered specially for the film.
""Girl With the Pearl Earring"" is a great drama that will surely please audiences.  Some people may have to watch it multiple times to fully understand the details since it's very deep and complex.",1089331200,,1598,5.2362204724409445
2007136,2,B0001K2L4W,"I was very excited for this film.  Scarlett Johansson is one of my favorite actresses, and I was impressed with the rest of the cast.  The story was interesting, however this film fell flat.  It was nonengaging and left the viewer with a lot to be desired.
While the cast is excellent, each character seems emotionless and the viewer feels very disconnected.  A lot happens in the story, yet none of the characters seem to care.  Greit has a relationship with a butcher, but it is difficult to tell if she even likes him.  She is expressionless around him, and does not seem at all in love at any point in the film.  At first I had the impression she only wanted to avoid him.  This was changed when we see a breif smile when she is with him deep into the film.
The rest of the relationships, as well, seem uninspired and flat.  Vermeer and Greit seemed to not care at all about each other.  There was no tension between them.  It felt empty.  The same was with all the characters, none of them seemed to care.  By the end, it felt as if nothing had happened between any of them.
Another big disappointment was the way the characters handled issues.  A lot happens that people would normally not take lightly, but nothing that occurs in this film seems to affect the characters later in the movie.
I found this movie, in short, completely unmoving and boring.  I felt disconnected and uninterested the whole way through.  The two stars come from my appreciation for the historical accuracy, sets, costumes and beautiful cinematography.  As for the movie itself, it falls flat.",1089244800,11,1576,4.551601423487544
2007137,3,B0001K2L4W,"A dramatic historical speculation on the identity of the subject of a famous painting? OK. It seems the story of ""The Girl With A Pearl Earring"" could have come up with a more intriguing idea than said subject being a house servant having an affair with the artist in his home. The real story of the lowly-classed dressed pretty woman wearing a jewel of an earring is probably much more interesting than this. The painting itself is much more interesting than this. Film starts out with an artist's eye revealing every framed image but seems to lose this technique as it moves along. The images gets shallower, as does the story.

2007149,4,B0001K2L4W,"A lushly filmed, atmospherically detailed historical drama in the ""Barry Lyndon"" tradition that will captivate art lovers, or anyone who has a fascination for the mysteries of the creative process. Costume drama favorite Colin Firth puts another plumed feather in his cap as the Dutch master Vermeer. Refreshingly, there is only a minimum of the usual ""tortured artist"" angst brushed on here (a la ""Lust For Life"" or ""Pollock"")- in fact, Firth's Vermeer is closer to a modern-day yuppie, scrambling to support his children, pay for the servants and keep his vain, neurotic wife happily bejewelled. The bulk of Vermeer's income is derived from commissioned paintings, and it is the speculative story behind one of these ""jobs"" that forms the basis of the film. Scarlett Johansson is perfectly cast as Vermeer's maid, who is destined to become the model for his iconic 'girl with a pearl earring' portrait. The film is deliberately paced, but quite compelling as it teasingly peels away the layers of the creative process. The growing, unspoken attraction between Vermeer and his maid is never physically acted on, but expressed in the little details; a scene where Firth teaches Johansson how to mix oils and create primary colors is fraught with subtle sensuality. The most striking (and inevitable) moment in the film occurs when Johansson's onscreen image, through lighting, pose, costume (and not to mention an uncanny physical likeness) becomes an exact mirror replica of the original painting. It is a truly sublime moment, and a credit to the filmaker's craft. Intelligent, adult storytelling at its best.",1089244800,,1611,5.2
2007150,5,B0001K2L4W,"Peter Webber's film ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" speculates about the events around the painting of Vermeer's masterpiece of the same name.  The art direction, costumes, sets and cinematography do a fantastic job of invoking that time period. Small details such as how the actual paint was made from the various ingredients Vermeer would gather add a wonderful authenticity to the proceedings.
Scarlett Johansson portrays Griet, a young woman from a family that has come upon financial hardhip only recently and needs Griet to work to help support the family.  Griet goes to be the maid in the household of the great Painter.
As a woman in a male-dominated society of centuries ago, eons before words like ""political correctness"" or ""sexual harrassment"" were coined, Griet is subject to the whims of her social superiors, and as maid almost everyone she meets is socially her superior.  Griet has spunk, though, and I liked the scene where Vermeer's bratty daughter deliberately smears Griet's freshly hung laundry with her muddy hand - Griet slaps the brat, then goes to pack her things thinking she is about to be let go.
Vermeer sees something in Griet that he doesn't see in his family or acquaintances. Griet has an artists eye, and an eagerness for learning, so Vermeer becomes both her master (as in employer) and her mentor.
Complications arise as Vermeer's wife does not possess the artistic eye and is insanely jealous, and Vermeer's wealthy patron Van Ruijven pays the bills but doesn't hesitate to puts his eyes and hands on any woman he cares to.

Visually, this is an absolutely stunning and beautiful film, with gorgeous lighting and an exquisite attention to detail. Dramatically, however, what little happens occurs too slowly. I would not recommend watching this film if you are already drowsy, as it will put you to sleep! Given that the film is almost totally fictional (in reality Vermeer was primarily an art dealer, and seems to never have relied on painting as a regular source of income) I'd hoped that the DVD would include extras to clarify the 'real' vs. the 'reel' Vermeer. Alas, this was not to be. I did love watching the film, as I'd had the pleasure of seeing several Vermeers at both the Frick and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

2007152,4,B0001K2L4W,"I read the book, I saw the film and I love Vermeer, but I  have my own ideas about this mysterious painter, and some how I have never pictured him as looking like Colin Firth, whom I like very much but not in this role. I would have cast an unknown actor and a Dutch one at that given there is so little dialogue in this film.  Scarlett Johannson is certainly a fine actress, and probably a good choice for her role (as are Judy Parfitt and Tom Wilkenson for their roles) but if Ms Johannson's lips get any bigger they will burst.  She is an excellent example of a beautiful young woman on the verge of being ruined by plastic surgery.  Why do women think making their lips look like labia makes them more attractive?
Thanks to the historian Simon Schama, whom Vreeland praises in her book, we have a good idea of the ""look"" of the 16th Century Netherlands. Few historical genre films are made about small places like the Netherlands, from whence emigrated my own ancestors, so I found this film a special treat. One of my own 7xgreat grandmothers was a washer-woman in Groeningen during this period, and I know her life was hard. I thought of her as I watched Griet wash clothes and hang them out to dry. And, it wasn't that long ago when I myself took frozen wash off the clothes line, so I know how things were dried before dryers.
Anyone familiar with Vermeer's work will recognize the ""bringing to life"" of several of his interior paintings, including of course, ""The Girl..""  We know little about the man, but something about the world around him which he painted.  Vermeer and other Dutch painters of his era, are distinguished because they captured common"" men, women, and children engaged in everyday activities that most of us recognize, and not the war moments and other' heroic' themes loved by the aristocracy. That Vermeer's life and times have been partially committed to film is no small thing. He wasn't as prolific as Rembrandt, but he was very special.",1088899200,,1971,4.569405099150142

2007155,5,B0001K2L4W,"The Girl with the Pearl Earring looks back at us from 1660 and inspired this beautiful movie (based on the novel) by the same title.  At a time when the Dutch ruled much of the world and there was the emergence of the middle class, women and artists still walked a very fine line between working and poverty; marriage is not much different. Like in Vermeer's paintings, the movie luxuriates in the details of never-ending and labor-intensive housework, preparing a feast for a patron, knoodling of couples, treachery of benignly neglected children, grinding and mixing paints and even taking a puppy off the kitchen table. It effectively portrays all the dimensions of the erotic nature of possessing objects.  Vermeer's mother-in-law exclaims that they are all caught like a fly in a web, and the characters and direction weave that web visually and metaphorically through this seamless production.  Who gets caught in it?  Who doesn't? Griet's loving young suitor warns her to be careful not to get caught up in Vermeer's world, and he is talking to us too.  We remember who we are and why that painting speaks to us in 2004 as an allegory of the modern age. Do you remember that old problem about a house being on fire and you can only save one thing:  a cat or a masterpiece painting of the cat?  Well, Tracy Chevalier with her novel, Peter Webber and the cast and crew of this film found a way to save both.

2007156,3,B0001K2L4W,"The magic of this movie is in the sets and cinematography. It's like stepping into a Vermeer painting and walking around. When you see Vermeer's compositions set up in situ and Colin Firth as Vermeer painting them, it brings these iconic images into a context that reminds you that they were painted by an artist striving for perfection, and not by a god. I grew up gazing at these paintings and seeing them only for their incredible depiction of light and beauty. The film's portrayal of the conditions under which they were created will enhance my appreciation of them all the more.
Although Charlotte Johannson is a beautiful actress and a good match for the model in the actual painting, I found her portrayal of Griet somewhat simple and less complex than the character in the novel. The contrast between the drudgery of her chores as a housemaid and the elation she experiences in the presence of Vermeer's talent is lost in her portrayal of Griet as a simple-minded near-child. Yes, she is beautiful and sensual, but does she really understand and appreciate the talent she beholds? I didn't buy the performance.
I can't imagine this movie with its slow pace being of interest to anyone who is unfamiliar with Vermeer's paintings. The book, to me, is more compelling because so much is conveyed in the narrative.

2007179,3,B0001K2L4W,"Based upon a best selling book of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, they were not fully realized. While the cinematography is exquisite, as every frame brings to mind a Vermeer painting or one by an old Dutch master, the film is static and becomes  enervated, sinking into a torpor that not even its beauty can cure.
The story line seems fairly simple. A pretty and seemingly intelligent Dutch girl, Griet (Scarlett Johansson), daughter of an artisan with failing eyesight, goes to work as a maid the home of painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), when her family's financial circumstance mandates that she seek employment. While in the Vermeer household, she is caught up in the undercurrents that exist within. When Griet catches the eye of Vermeer's wealthy patron (Tom Wilkinson),  she becomes the object of the patron's lust, the object of Vermeer's wife's (Essie Davis) jealousy, and the subject of one of Vermeer's most noted paintings.
Unfortunately, the storyline is static in its presentation, never fully realizing any of its plots or sub-plots. Too much is left unexplained and too little is alluded  for the viewer to draw inferences to fill in the story gaps.  This is a shame, given the time, expense, and attention to detail given to the entire production.  Consequently, the film moves as if it were a montage of beautifully drafted paintings transplanted to film. It is ponderously slow,  forgetting that it is a film requiring some cohesion of story or plot, something that this film lacks. More telling, it lacks real dramatic tension. It is almost as if the filmmaker  were more interested in the form of the film rather than its substance. Therein lies the rub.
Still, the sheer beauty of the cinematography alone makes this film worth seeing. Seventeenth century Holland is painstakingly brought to life. There is no detail that is left to chance in the exquisite re-creation of the environs and material goods of the characters. Much effort is devoted to authenticity of detail. Moreover, the use of lighting is extraordinary, causing every scene to look as if it were a moment captured in time for all posterity. This film was justifiably nominated for an Academy Award in 2004 for its cinematography. I am only surprised that it lost to Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.
Scarlett Johanssen bears a remarkable resemblance to the subject of the noted painting by Vermeer, and she shimmers with a compelling luminosity throughout the film. She is simply sheer physical perfection in the role. In terms of illuminating the viewer as to the psyche of her character, she falls somewhat short, giving only tantalizing glimpses of what lays beneath her impassive demeanor, as she forms a bond with Vermeer, sharing a seemingly mutual appreciation of aesthetics. Colin Firth, in the role of Vermeer, falls a little short of the mark. Disheveled and seemingly unkempt, he appears doltish and boorish rather than artistic. One gets very little sense of the artist through his performance, but, in all fairness, he has very little dialogue with which to work. Perhaps that is intentional, as a sublimation to his artistry. The viewer is left unsure. Whatever the reason, his performance simply fails to paint a meaningful portrait of the artist.
The roles of Vermeer and Griet  are the primary roles, yet they fail to carry the film, as they are too underdeveloped to convey the story the director seems to be trying to tell. Essie Davis gives an excellent performance as Catharina, Vermeer's jealous and histrionic wife. Judy Parfitt is compelling as Maria Thins,  Vermeer's practical and socially conscious mother-in-law. Tom Wilkinson gives a fine performance as the wealthy, lustful patron, Van Ruyven. Cillian Murphy is outstanding as Pieter, the very handsome butcher's boy who falls in love with Griet. Joanna Scanlan is very good in the role of Tannake, the cook and housekeeper. Still, their performances are not sufficient to bring the story together, as they are secondary characters that are as underdeveloped as the primary ones.

See the film for its beauty, but do not expect a story that is compelling.",1087689600,12,4195,5.023021582733813

Nevertheless, this movie is well acted, well cast and the sound is just awesome in it, phenomenal recording, very natural.
I love this movie, as I do those that treat life and reveal it as closely as possible.  Easily one of the better movies in 2003.
I won't say much about the plot, other that it is very straightforward, but I did not find it boring, there's plenty to keep you interested if you can afford a good sound system (and I don't mean Bose systems, I mean real audio gear).

I don't mind movies that move slowly but develop (Cohen's The Man Who Wasn't There) however Pearl Earring just kinda pokes along...This movie would appeal to the crowd that enjoyed Gosford Park in my opinion- one terrible movie in its own right. You want to see an entertaining movie out of the ordinary? The Royal Tennenbaum's or Amelie are two brilliant options for you...if you like bizarre Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind are some winners for you.

2007182,4,B0001K2L4W,"In Peter Webber's directorial debut, we have a slow methodical telling of how Vermeer painted his ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" masterpiece.  Eduardo Serra received his second Oscar nomination for cinematography to follow his first for ""The Wings of the Dove.""  While most awards went to the Lord of the Rings, Serra's accomplishment is no less impressive.  The film unfolds as if it were a painting with emphasis being placed on light, shadow and color.  Just as light visually reflects on the space between objects, Webber's often wordless shots reflect on the space between characters, emphasizing relationship as much as plot.
Colin Firth from ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" and ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" does a breathtaking job as the darkly tempted painter whose talent only barely controls his hormonal attraction to Griet, the maid who becomes the subject of the painting.  Scarlett Johansson who shined in ""Lost In Translation"" with Bill Murray and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" comes across as mysterious and self-controlled.  Her continual reactions, uncertainty of youth, and beauty deepen the dialogue and the spaces between words.
As Vermeer's wife Catharina, Essie Davis does a marvelous job as the jealous wife.  She seems totally different from her appearances in ""Matrix Revolutions"" and ""Matrix Reloaded.""  Her jealously, her rage, her social consciousness are played with such style and grace that I found myself a new fan of this fine actress.  The character of her mother was also well done.
Tom Wilkinson usually plays a brooding hurt character such as his Oscar nominated role for ""In the Bedroom"" or a pompous fellow such as van Juijven, Vermeer's benefactor.  Wilkinson is compiling a quite large body of work after appearances in ""The Full Monty,"" ""Shakespeare In Love"" & ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" that he gives a depth to his characterizations beyond the dialogue.  Here there is menace as he controls the Vermeer purse strings and attempts a quickie with Griet behind the clotheslines.
Griet's boyfriend is Irish heartthrob Cillian Murphy who is most known on this side of the Atlantic for ""28 Days Later.""  He does a great job as the butcher's son who is Griet's romantic interest.  The film felt a bit abrupt in its ending.  I would have liked to see Griet married to the butcher lad as in the novel rather than seeming to have been hung in space after the completion of the painting.
This is an interesting piece.  Vermeer has long been one of my favorite artists.  I thoroughly enjoyed the period piece set in Delft.  Although slow, this film does show an exquisite beauty.  The DVD extras do add to our appreciation for the film.  Enjoy!",1087430400,2,2680,4.995495495495495

2007184,3,B0001K2L4W,"Director Peter Webber makes his film debut with ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"", a lush and visually beautiful film about famous Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer's inspiration and creation of one of the most celebrated paintings of all time.  Featuring an inspired cast of Scarlet Johansson, who plays Griet, the servant girl whom inspires Vermeer to paint his masterpiece, Colin Firth as Vermeer, Tom Wilkinson, and Cillian Murphy and showcasing some of the most astounding cinematography and art direction I've ever scene on screen, this is truly a film to behold.  It is visually stunning, virtually a painting in movement and is simply breathtaking to behold.  The atmosphere is so perfectly created by the lavish sets, intricate costumes, enchanting lighting, striking cinematography, and beautiful music that one cannot help but be impressed by the amount of effort that went into creating this piece of art.
Unfortunately, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" suffers from a severe case of ""high on style, low on substance syndrome"".  All in all, not much happens in this film and along with the sparse dialogue, it soon becomes difficult for audiences to stay interested; despite the abundant visual radiance of the film.  The story simply lacks a driving force that would have kept it flowing and viewers interested.  Therefore, it, regrettably, plods along at an excruciatingly dull pace.",1087257600,5,1383,5.235294117647059
2007185,2,B0001K2L4W,"I wanted to kill some time and decided to go to the nearest cinema... unfortunately, the movies I wanted to see had already begun and I've seen a beautiful poster of ""girl with a pearl earring""... Then I recalled that this movie was one of the movies that could win some Oscars (I just didn't remember which ones), and I decided to see it.
It's nice when you enter in a theater with an open mind. The first minutes of the movie are quite promising, and it really captures the environment of an old european time.
Basically it makes us accompany the story of a young maid that goes to work in a house of a famous painter.
It's quite interesting to see that this movie isn't full of cliches... I mean, the poor girl doesn't become a cinderella in the end (much on the contrary), she doesn't behave badly, her patrons treat her quite fairly (of course, sometimes a bit rudely, but she's just a servant!), she works hard, and she dates a butcher guy.
The problem with this movie is that when you see that it's finished, you can't avoid the feeling that there's a lot of things missing here.
Along the movie the girl begins to help the painter in his work.
Before I proceed, I'm not complaining that she doesn't have some crush with him. Actually, that's other good point in the movie (and one less cliche). Even if he desired her, he wouldn't have anything serious with her, and would always rather his wife to her because of his social status.
On the other hand, the movie lets the impression that there's something in the air between them. Moreover, the movie lets a lot of things in the air. However, none of them are ever explored further.
The girl is quite always with the same impassive face. It's difficult to get engaged with her feelings, or feel anything about her end, and the end of other characters. This is the great problem of this movie, it is very cold, completely dispassionate, a lot unsatisfactory.
We know that the girl doesn't have many friends and that she can't afford to be complaining along the movie. But there's not enough scenes, when we can see her making reflections about her life, or that we are able to see clearly her thoughts (since, her face doesn't say much)! She has a romance with a butcher boy, but except for a short passage when we see a brief smile at her face, we never know if she really feels anything for him! There's an old guy that's desiring her too... He even makes some advances, but besides her natural immediate reactions, we never see her thinking twice about the subject!
I don't know! I think this movie could be much better, could also be a bit longer to accommodate more character developments, etc. But it isn't! I really don't recommend anybody to buy this movie. Even to rent it, you really need two things: lots of time to kill and to be in a good mood to watch with an open mind.",1086739200,14,2840,4.432122370936902
2007186,5,B0001K2L4W,"Widely known as the ""Dutch Mona Lisa"", ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is universally recognized as one of Johannes Vermeer's  masterpieces. After more than a century  of study, the work still poses significant questions. Who was the sitter and was the painting even intended as a portrait? Why had it  remained in complete obscurity until it was rediscovered in 1882 and sold for the mere pittance of a reproduction?  Did Vermeer sell this painting during his lifetime? Many questions surround this masterpiece.  Tracy Chevalier's novel is just one of the many historical tales that COULD HAVE happened to answer the unanswered.
All of the characters are strong in this well made, period piece.  Collin Firth's most excellent portrayal of Vermeer, Scarlett Johansson as Griet, the Vermeer Family maid, Judy Parfitt as Vermeer's mother-in-law, Maria Thins, Essie Davis as Catharina, Vermeer's wife, and the disgustingly lurid, Van Ruijven is played aptly by Tom Wilkinson.
I won't give you a blow by blow of the story as you should see it for yourself.  It is mainly about the unrequited lust and love between Griet and Vermeer, their eye for art, and the many similiarities that they share.
The cinematography, music, & lighting are TOP NOTCH and it's like watching a Vermeer painting come to life right on your TV screen.
You don't need to be an art lover to love this movie.  If you like period pieces like, Emma, Sense and Sensibility, Valmont, Room With A View, House Of Mirth, and the like, you will enjoy this film.

No words can describe my dissapointment in renting this movie and finding not one single shred of commemorable performances, even from the main character who only had a handful of lines.  The pace if horrendously slow, the script itself confused as to what and who the storyline is actually about, and the relationships stupidly portrayed.  Huge issues take place such as adultery, rape, and virginity, and NOT ONE of the characters seems altered and these events are never referred to ever again.  It seams as if bratty spoiled kids tormenting the maid is monumentally more important than the touchy issues I mentioned previously.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not playing the card of devil's advocate here going against these past raving reviews...I just honestly and genuinely felt 500 times less intellgient after watching this dreadful, dreadful, dreadful movie.",1086307200,16,1009,5.320754716981132
2007198,3,B0001K2L4W,"The novel, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" by Tracy Chevalier, was deservedly acclaimed by the literary world.  Chevalier captured the atmosphere of 17th Century Holland perfectly, and she brought the characters of Johannes Vermeer and Griet, the maid who loves art, to vibrant life. The book inspired discussion groups, a gorgeous exhibit in the Met, and many newspaper and magazine spreads.  It was a cultural phenomenon.
The film, alas, although beautiful to behold, is slow-moving and too shallow to do justice to the book.  The director, Peter Webber, evokes little emotional resonance from his actors.  Griet is supposed to be a very intelligent and intuitive young woman with strong artistic leanings. A restrained Scarlett Johansson plays Griet as a timid and bewildered maiden.  Colin Firth is a disheveled and distracted Vermeer, who fails to impart the genius behind the man.
The story takes place mostly in the house of the great Dutch painter.  Vermeer is surrounded by a passel of women, including his sharp-tongued mother-in-law, Maria Thins, his fertile wife, Catharina, his resentful daughter, Cornelia, and numerous other children and servants.  Thins is constantly pressuring her son-in-law to paint faster, since the family needs money to maintain their costly lifestyle.  Vermeer, however, is a perfectionist who works slowly and deliberately.  He refuses to churn out assembly-line paintings. Although the playful butcher's son, Pieter, is courting Griet, her heart belongs to Vermeer and his art.
Griet is fascinated by the complexities of painting.  How are beautiful colors mixed, and how does an artist decide to place his subject in a particular position or in a certain light?  Vermeer finds Griet to be an apt and eager pupil and she secretly becomes his assistant.  She also becomes his model when the lecherous Van Ruijven, played with relish by Tom Wilkinson, commissions Vermeer to paint her.  The result is the timeless work of art that has captured the imagination of the world.
The lighting, cinematography, and costume design in ""Pearl Earring"" are all breathtaking.  However, it takes more than surface beauty to make a memorable motion picture.  If the director and the actors had dug deeper into the book's themes to better explore the tempestuous emotions that lay beneath the surface, they might have imbued the film with a bit more animation and depth.",1086307200,6,2392,5.241469816272966
2007199,4,B0001K2L4W,"Based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier, `Girl with a Pearl Earring' tells the story of the seventeenth-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth) and Griet (Scarlett Johansson) a peasant girl who is forced to work as a maid in Vermeer's home. Griet's understanding of art combined with her beauty draws Vermeer to her. Her beauty also attracts the butcher's son, Pieter (the beautiful Cillian Murphy). Vermeer's obsession with Griet becomes obvious to Catharina, (Essie Davis) his jealous and possessive wife and her scheming mother. Vermeer's lustful patron, Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) agrees to continue his patronage if Vermeer will paint Griet. Therefore, Griet becomes the subject of one of Vermeer's most famous pieces.
The acting is very good; each actor portrays his or her character just as they should be represented - separated by a strict class system. From a female perspective, it was entertaining to watch the sexual tension and the evolution of the relationship between Griet and Vermeer. You long for them to end up together, but it would have been out of the question in such a society. The most notable component of this film is the lighting and cinematography. It is so delicate, so precise, and so atmospheric that it feels as if you are watching a painting in motion. Unfortunately, the script is lacking and the pace is dreadfully slow.
`Girl with a Pearl Earring' is aesthetically pleasing and delivers the sensation that you are right there in seventeenth-century Holland. Take time out to watch and appreciate this beautiful film.",1086220800,4,1566,5.12109375
2007200,5,B0001K2L4W,"Have you read the book? Then watch the movie. Have you watched the movie? Then read the book. They complement each other. Tracy Chevalier's story is greatly transported to the big screen by director Peter Webber. But that's not what's best about ""Girl with a pearl earring"".
Like Leonardo's Mona Lisa, nobody is sure about who was Jan Vermeer's model for his most famous portrait. Tracy Chevalier's story took care of that. The book is very enjoyable, leaving the reader's imagination work free, but when you're reading about Vermeer, and his paintings are an important part of the plot, you feel something is missing. And this ""something"" are concrete visions of his fantastic works. Some of them were displayed in the movie. But Peter Webber went further, and, with help of Director of Cinematography Eduardo Serra, transformed the whole movie in a Vermeer painting.
There evidently is an enormous care taken concerning historic portrayal. Watching the movie, the viewer feels he's in 17th century Delft. The supporting cast is great in the sense that it helps creating the ancient atmosphere. For example, the maid Tanneke (who was the model for Vermeer's ""Milkmaid"") is played by Joanna Scanlan, who really looks (at least in the movie) like a dutch maid from 350 years ago. The figure, the scenery, the chosen colors, all great. Many of the frames are purposedly created to resemble Vermeer's paintings: the light, the objects, the gestures of the people. Sometimes, during the movie, I caught myself with a hanging jaw, truly emotioned by the beauty of the scenes.
All this bonded together by the simple soundscore, present always at the right moments, and by rising star Scarlett Johanson's acting: strong, objective, believable. She's the center of the movie, and rightly so.
""Girl with a pearl earring"" is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.

2007201,5,B0001K2L4W,"...it permeates and imbues the masterpieces that flowed from the brush of Johannes Vermeer - and it breathes life and subtle but tangible vitality into this wonderfully filmed adaptation of Tracy Chevalier's best-selling novel of the same title.  Chevalier says that her book looks at the creation of a painting - one of the great works of art of the 17th century - and imagines the story behind it.  Working closely with the author, Olivia Hetreed has produced a script that skillfully converts the images of Chevalier's glowing prose into light and images and actions on the screen - a daunting task, especially in this case.  Choosing to illuminate the differences between the classes at play in this story through images more than dialogue placed an additional burden on the shoulders of the director and actors - but they have managed it very nicely indeed.
Scarlett Johansson is nothing short of luminous - appropriate in a Vermeer subject - in the title role of Griet, a seventeen year-old girl who has come to live in the home of the artist and his large, continuously growing family.  Aside from the dynamics at play between the classes - masters and servants - there are emotional and psychological forces involved as well.  The artist's wife is a stunningly beautiful by neurotic and insecure woman.  Her mother, who lives with them and manages the household with a necessarily tight fist, is so dedicated to their collective financial survival (bankruptcy claims neighbors, and looms over the Vermeer household ominously) that she is willing to accept her son-in-law's obsession with Griet in order that he be inspired to create yet another great painting - the commission of which is of vital monetary importance to the family.
Colin Firth is cast well as the great master, Johannes Vermeer - he plays the `tortured artiste' angle gently but realistically, never going over the top with it.  He obviously loves his wife - but his almost immediate fascination with Griet blossoms into a driving obsession.  Without acting on their feelings by more than an occasional touch or a lingering glance, the two learn from and inspire each other immeasurably - Vermeer is astonished to find within Griet a kindred spirit, the soul of an artist in the body of a serving girl.  The film hints at her understanding of the interplay of colour and light - the novel, understandably, goes into it in much greater detail - but the script and the fine work of the cast and crew pull it off very well indeed.
The dark force at play in this story is Vermeer's patron and benefactor, Master van Ruijven, portrayed with oily excellence by Tom Wilkinson.  A man whose wealth is seemingly out of reach of any potential creditors, van Ruijven revels in his position, in his ability to coerce and direct the actions of Vermeer and his family as if they were marionettes.  When he first sets eyes on Griet, the dark lust within him can be seen to smoulder - and he sets about machinating stress and anxiety in the Vermeer household as if it were his personal toy.
Griet's family background is portrayed with much more detail in the novel - her father is a former artisan, a tile maker, blinded in an accident, depending on the meager support offered by the Guild to sustain his family.  When it becomes clear that this small stipend will not be enough for them to survive, the decision is made that Griet should go to work for Vermeer - and arrangement made through the Guild.  When she moves into the artist's home, she takes with her a lovely tile that her father had made years before, as a physical token of his presence and importance in her life.
The pace of the film is slow and careful - befitting the mood and look of Vermeer's paintings.  The cinematography is gorgeous throughout - as pointed out by other reviewers, there are many scenes that come as close as commercial cinema can come to the atmosphere of one of the master's paintings.  It's a stunningly beautiful film, and a captivating story - all in all, a job very well done.
The DVD edition available at this time doesn't boast many extras - but a nice bonus is the `Anatomy of a scene' feature from the Sundance Channel, which takes the lavish banquet scene from the film and examines the 'hows' and 'whys' of the methods used in filming it.  It features snippets of interviews with the director, author, screenwriter and Johansson - some longer versions of these interviews would be nice in a later edition.",1085702400,4,4467,4.737113402061856

2007203,4,B0001K2L4W,"Definitely a mood piece, this lemon-tinted celluloid confection relating to the genesis of Vermeer's masterpiece, ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"", provides mere mortals not only a glimpse into 17th century Flemish life, where the formula creating great art relies on the not-so-constant variables of fickle patron, tight-fisted mother-in-law, and an insecure ever-pregnant wife, but a  silent communication between a visionary and his inspiration.

For dialogue plays second-fiddle to lusciously crafted cinematic moments infused with expertly-rendered replications of Vermeer's famous settings -- we watch Griet, the newly hired maid, reach to wash the studio windows and ""Woman with A Water Jug"" materializes from concept to canvas.  Conversation between the players merely enhances an already ionically charged scene, explaining the pressures--pressures that transcend period and are equally threatening in the 21st century--- of Vermeer's overextended household where secondary character moter-in-law Maria Thins, finds herself in the omnipotent managerial position og balancing her budget, salving her daughter's self-persecuting vulnerability, securing further commissions, turning a blind eye to patron Van Ruijven's lascivious appetites and understanding Vermeer's need for a form of intimacy with his muse in order to produce his great art.

Colin Firth, ever smouldering, plays Vermeer with a quiet acceptance of his circumstances; his impatience to create supercedes his desire for making the explanations pleaded for by his wife.  But Scarlett Johansson as the teenaged Griet and lead, provides the ethereal quality so necessary to the success of this film. Her upturned face shines with her character's pride---cold and translucent with the perfect symmetry of the full moon, yet imploring and nascent in her innocence.  Her dialogue is unnecessary, in fact, seeing her in the accompanying music video somewhat ruins the illusion created by that last shot of her face.

Those of you who enjoy silences, watch this film in silence with no distractions; savor the textures, the colors, the shadows and most of all the light.  Remember it is a fantasy, wrought by novelist Tracy Chevalier and brought to life, slice by delicious slice by documentary maker Peter Webber.

It is not always what is actually said, but what is conveyed in body language and eye contact. Under the surface the same sexual tension that was so obvious in the book, is very real and very present. Collin Firth has made a name for himself playing brooding and somewhat dark characters. His Vermeer is just that. Scarlet Johansson plays young Griet, caught between the world she knows as a peasant and the world of her Master. She is caught between the forbidden feelings and connections she has with her Master and Peter the butcher's son who is so clearly in love with her.

The story of Griet, a girl who must leave the security of her family home and become a servant in the Vemeer household. Her unfavorable position is not sugar coated as the viewer is shown her obnoxious charges, arduous labor and the upper class characters she must deal with.
The acting is superb in this film as is the filming itself. Each scene looks like a painting unto itself. The colors and lighting are enticing and draw you into each scene. Indeed the reason the painting is commissioned is the repulsive lust of Vemeer's patron.
The sensuality of this work fairly jumps off the screen. The scenes between Vemeer and Greit are among the most intense as you see Greit trying understand this enigmatic man while still remember her station in their world.
The story was hard to follow in places making me assume much was cut out from the original book. I hope reading the book will fill in the gaps and add depth to the characters that so intrigued me in the movie.

2007206,5,B0001K2L4W,"'Girl With a Pearl Earring', by first-time director Peter Webber allows for a higher level of beauty and artistic film-making.  Based on the novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, the movie tells the story of a young maid working in the house of the Flemish painter Vermeer, and how she became the subject of a painting.
The story is not wordy or burdened with dialogue, but instead is told mostly by focusing on the expressions of Griet (Scarlett Johannson), and how her uneducated mind can look around her and see beauty and almost painting-like surroundings that are around her.  She daydreams while she works and becomes lost in the world of her master.
The story progresses slowly but interestingly as we are given insight into daily life around a lake where gondolas are used, and how it freezes in winter, to the clothes they wear, and the heirarchies of the household.
Griet works in her master's studio all the while, knowing that she should be cautious when cleaning the windows as it may change the light, and leaving everything exactly as it is.  Eventually she forms a relationship with her master and learns how the camera obscura works, and learns how to mix his paints, and learns how complex the beauty of the world is.  When asked about the colors of the clouds, she says they are yellow, blue, and grey, and she understands.
While there is a definite attraction between Griet and Vermeer, it is never fulfilled, and it stays only as glances.
The story progresses and she becomes the subject of a new commission thanks to the lascivious ways of the patron Van Ruijven.  To do the painting, Griet must wear the pearl earrings worn by his jealous wife.  She finds out and the plot reaches it's climax as Vermeer paints Griet.
The movie accomplishes greatness thanks to the efforts of everyone involved, the director for placing the silent barriers between Griet and the household of her master, the score which is graceful and soft, Scarlett Johansson's facial expressions and the final one that so closely mimics the girl's in the painting that for a moment they seem to look very similar, and the cinematography.
The cinematography is the most important aspect of the film, as it really sets the period and makes every scene look like a moving painting.  This is perhaps the most aesthetically brilliant movie of all time, and certainly the best in recent memory.",1085529600,10,2385,4.774271844660194

Nice to see they still make intelligent, well-crafted films like this... and bravo to Scarlet Johanssen for continuing to pick such classy roles.  This is another fine feather under her cap.",1085443200,3,650,5.352941176470588
2007227,5,B0001K2L4W,"This year, 2003, will be remembered as the year in which Scarlett Johansson made her debut in the big screen with astounding success. Her roles in ""Lost in Translation"" and in this movie gained two nominations for the Golden Globes, and even though she did not win any of them, everyone recognized her talent. It is particularly enlightening to the Johansson playing two roles that are complete opposites, a married young woman in the twentieth century in Japan and an introverted young maid in seventeenth century Holland.
Griet (Johansson) is an adolescent that has a blind father and is forced to leave her home and go work for a wealthy family when the economic situation warrants it. The master of the house is no other than the painter Johannes Vermeer, who lives there with his wife, several kids, his mother in-law and a myriad of servants. The madam of the house and her eldest daughter receive Griet in an unfriendly manner, but she receives the ""gift"" of being in charge of cleaning Vermeer's atelier. She is mesmerized by the paintings and treats everything with immense respect and reverence.
Vermeer takes his time with each painting, having to constantly fight with the pressure his wife and mother in-law put upon him when the funds become meager. Now he has received the news that his patron Peter van Ruijven will not pay for another painting right away, but will go with another painter instead. He then seeks to find a new source of inspiration and thus starts a peculiar relationship with Griet.
This film has various admirable attributes, like the impeccable settings, the uplifting music and the fascinating details presented about the life in Holland in the seventeenth century. Moreover, the description of how the colors and the paintings were created is extremely interesting. For those of you that are bothered by a movie with a slow pace, I have no other choice but to recommend you to stay away from this one, but everyone else should watch it. As a final recommendation, I would advise you to go online and look at Vermeer's paintings before watching the movie, especially ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and ""Young Woman with a Water Pitcher"".",1085356800,,2175,4.8652291105121295

It is as if I stepped into Vermeer's Holland. The story is engaging and the tension between Vermeer (Firth) and Griet (Johansen) is so strong. Again, Colin Firth delivers an excellant performance, conveying so much with a smoldering look or angry glare that the little lines he does have are almost unnecessary. Scarlett Johanson as Griet is wonderful as well. The score is very well done, adding to the film and never distracting from it. Wonderful performances all around.

And several artistic tropes like kitchen sinks, fluffy European countryside outfits, chillies, forgotten mirrors, color mixing palettes. Plus, some good ol' accordion music in the backdrop.
All this produces the cinematic equivalent of window shopping. You can see it, but there's nothing to feel or experience. It's a chain of images of famous Vermeer works, and the historical detail is painstakingly realized.
We get teasers of a budding love story, which gives us hope of an oncoming story, a theme. It never does. Oh yeah, it's supposed to work under the surface, but it ends up buried so deep that it's hard to believe. Smoldering glances and vaguely suggestive conversations lead to precious little.

From the very beginning of the movie, you feel almost drawn to her.  Indeed, she very well might have said fewer words than any actress ever in a leading role.  Nevertheless, she commands attenttion in every scene.  Her fawning silence envokes immediate sympathy for her unfortunate situation.  This role is certainly much different than her part in ""Lost in Translation"" , but her performance, once again, commands the respect of Hollywood.",1084752000,,586,5.180851063829787
2007233,5,B0001K2L4W,"I'll go against the grain here and say I think the movie is better than the book, mostly because the format of a movie in general is a third-person viewpoint of events. We are voyeurs while watching films, witnessing events and intimate moments like hidden ghosts. Griet's character in the movie is more believable, she's illiterate, she's hard working, she's ignorant of many things (but far from stupid). But the book makes the mistake of using Griet as the narrator of the book, as if we are to believe she's telling us what's happening. I just don't buy it. An illiterate character telling her story like a novelist? Nuh uh. It jolts me out of any realism the book tries to convey. However, the movie is like a secret camera capturing the subtle and VERY important language of the face and eyes. Most of the movie is short on dialogue, but FULL of expressive language by way of body movement and glances of the eyes and even the use of clothing. The movie's plot or story has been boiled down by many other reviews, so there's no need to keep mining that ore. But I've heard some people complain about how the characters don't ""talk"" enough. But this movie communicates more with expressions of the face than anything words could do. Colin Firth, who plays Vermeer, has even said he wished the movie had LESS dialogue. The choice of Scarlett Johansson is perfect, and it's sad to think most people consider the talented delivery of lines to be the barometer of ""good acting,"" because it's rare to see someone brilliantly convey so much emotion and ""language"" without even talking. I don't know if Johansson is consciously aware how expressive and talented she is with her eyes and face, but it doesn't matter - she's a gem. And it's very important to get the right actors in a movie like this. They wanted Kate Hudson at first, but she backed away at the last minute. What a relief. I think she would have ruined the movie, or at least degraded it to subpar quality. The movie might be boring for those who are too immersed in the culture of babbling. We in America are blunted by talking heads, talking friends, talking and words and more talking. But in the class society of Vermeer's world, where maids are to keep quiet until spoken to, and where people don't babble at each other with any random thought that occurs to them, holding the tongue was a way of life. But if you can transport yourself away from modern culture and enter this movie with an open mind, there's a treasure of beauty and intelligence. The movie will haunt you for days.",1084579200,,2552,4.574235807860262
2007234,5,B0001K2L4W,"Like Vermeer's paintings, I feel that ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is a masterpiece; it is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.
I am an avid reader, and I read the book before I saw the movie.  In my experience, seldom does a film even begin to capture the beauty of a good book.  However, this film has shown me that my previous theory is not always true; ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" captures most, if not all, of the beauty of the book while maintaining cinematic excellence.
While I do agree with a few of the other reviewers' view that certain wonderful parts of the book were left out of the movie, this is understandable; for the most part, I feel that the right moments were captured.
I do believe that my favorite aspects of this film are the colors used and the silence that prevails throughout the film.  The colors used were absolutely beautiful: almost too dark, plush, real. The strategically-placed lack of talking also left more the imagination, making it easy for viewers to fill in the silences with imagined thoughts.
I also thought that the casting was perfect.  Scarlett Johansson resembles the girl with a pearl earring in Vermeer's famous painting very closely, and Colin Firth portrayed Vermeer with a skill I never knew he had.
This tale of a girl whose blinded father can no longer support her Protestant family and is forced to send her off to be a maid in a Catholic artist's household is poignant and vividly ""painted"" into a masterpiece of a film.  The underlying emotions between silences and syllables are heartwrenching and true to human form.
I would recommend this beautiful film to anyone with interest in art, history, or wonderfully-told fiction.  It is a believable account of what could have been an impetus for Vermeer's painting and its terrifying consequences.",1084579200,2,1814,4.742857142857143
2007255,5,B0001K2L4W,"What seems like another movie, where nothing really happens, this is a gem in the sea of unappetizing costume movies, with harsh fake lighting and CG effects.
We see the Vermeer family through the eyes of Griet, played by Johansson. The doe eyed pale girl, hardly speaks yet conveys so much emotion. Her purity stands out in this role, she is labored by hard chores, a woman hungry patron, who's interested in her (he commissions the painting, of which this movie takes title of) Vermeer's jealous wife, and her relationship with the young man, who's a butcher.
What made this movie spectacular, was the crisp, organic, and sometimes muddy when needed cinematography. The lighting, costumes, interiors, looked so appropriate, not fake or harsh, with everyone moving and speaking just so, that I felt as if I was watching a real life scene form 1600's! That is rare in today's Hollywood blockbusters.
I'll recommend this quiet, beautiful movie to anyone who likes to look at enchanting things.",1084406400,,992,4.981927710843373
2007256,3,B0001K2L4W,"Warning:  the following review was written by a person who had read the book before seeing the movie.  Approach with caution!
Girl With a Pearl Earring was visually beautiful.  This film deserves every nomination it ever got for anything related to cinematography, costume, art direction and lighting.  Unfortunately, that's where its praise ends as far as I'm concerned.
Although I had my problems with the book, I was able to recognize it as a fine achievement nonetheless and gave it five stars in a previous review.  Not so with the film version.  This movie is a very shallow interpretation of the themes, events and emotions presented in GWAPE the book.  The screenwriter(s) apparently ignored huge chunks of/ events in Griet's past life, a few characters and scenes in the plot's present time and rearranged elements of the story to their liking.  We don't see the maid Griet's little personality quirks that make her so unusual for her time, like a preoccupation with sanitary habits and a view of the world that is rather independent and unique.  We don't know about her sad family situation, in which her father lost his sight and his own artistic ability with it, her brother (with whom she was quite close once) left to apprentice as a tilemaker. We don't see the little dinner scenes in which her parents push her engagement with the butcher's son so that they can have meat.  Basically, we never meet the young woman named Griet, only a pale shadow of her.  The result of all this is great disappointment to anybody who's read the book beforehand, and a much more simplistic story that focuses on Griet's dilemma as a thwarted crush on her master, painter Vermeer -- rather than the thwarted romance with her true love, Art.
If the movie had appeared to at least try, then failure would have been understandable.  I don't think readers generally expect a perfect interpretation of the written word into a visual medium like film.  But...the movie didn't even try.  The director, writers, team et al. cut the heart and soul of GWAPE to leave us with a very mediocre Hollywood romance set in a costumed historical time period.  All style and no substance.
On the other hand, if you've not read the book, go ahead and see this movie.  It's not bad as a simple historical romance story, and as I've already said, it is beautiful to watch.  Without raised expectations from the novel you might enjoy it.

However, this film has one major flaw; a flaw shared by nearly all period films.  Rather than utilizing the splendid music of this period, the film makers paid good money for a trite, hackneyed, even annoying musical score, which, rather than being part of the film is separate from it, even alien to it.
After the first viewing, one might turn off the sound for future viewings and watch the film while playing CDs of 17th century music.",1084233600,,670,5.027027027027027

Scarlett Johansson's young Griet, up against Colin Firth's Vermeer, intrigued me--along with his hair! The costumes were brilliant, as well as the setting and scenes that were like stepping into a painting. I felt Missus Vermeer's pain when she pleaded heartbrokenly: ""Why can't you ever paint ME?"" But, a little more drama and excitement would have kept me riveted.",1084233600,4,453,5.219178082191781
2007259,4,B0001K2L4W,"The best chess players possess the mechanics of the game before their first pawn, and math prodigies see equations in ordinary life before they've even learned their meaning. And so, ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" argues, it goes with artists - the arrangement of shade and texture is hard-wired into their senses; they understand, intrinsically, what series of brushstrokes, with which series of colors, need to be made to create a satin skirt that looks alive.
When handmaiden Griet chops vegetables in 1665 Holland, she arranges the beats, onions and cabbage in order of color that adheres to a certain logic inside her brain. Later, when she's asked by famous Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth) to name the colors in the clouds outside his studio window, Griet at first says white. Vermeer knows she sees more. Griet does too. She sees yellow. Then blue. Then gray. She knows what he knows.
In a movie that does justice to Tracy Chevalier's quiet, powerful source novel, the tragedy is Griet, played mostly in silence by Scarlett Johannson, cannot do anything with what she knows but become Vermeer's muse, and eventually his subject in his best-known, titular painting. That in itself is dangerous:
The women of the Vermeer house, wife Catharina (Essie Davis) and mother-in-law Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), are brittle and insecure; they need Vermeer to keep painting on terms they consistently want to change for a fickle, vicious patron in Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) who enjoys the women in Vermeer's paintings as much as he enjoys the paintings. ""You are a fly in (Van Ruijven's) web,"" Maria Thins says to Griet. ""Just like the rest of us."" Vermeer was a slow painter, needing nearly divine intervention to begin a work, and months of tinkering to complete one. Van Ruijven, thus, is a necessity.
""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is a subtle work, anchored by Johannson, who radiates Griet's fierce intelligence and curiosity underneath the customary courtesies and nods of a maid. This is a shrewd, darkly comic girl discovering the complexities, and fruits, of aristocratic life, and preferring them a to night out with the butcher's son. Could an indentured maid enjoy a better life than the ""free"" wife of a meat merchant? If it involves an art studio, Griet seems to think, maybe.
Eduardo Serra's distinct camerawork matches Vermeer's moody paintings - shades of dark and light, cramped interiors, a slight haze to any shot outdoors. When Griet and a young suitor walk the fields outside town, the sky is a bright, alive tan - something out of a Terrence Malick film. Director Peter Webber has to linger on Johannson's face a great deal in preparation for the painting, so you'd better like it. Johannson's lips, it should be noted, give Angelina Jolie's a run for their money.
Griet does not mean trouble in the Vermeer household, but her sensuality makes her trouble, and the women of the house, out of boredom and pastime jealousy, badly want to make trouble. Vermeer, under the watch of Maria Thins, could never sleep with Griet. But he could make paints with her. And use his wife's earrings in a portrait. These deceits are more intimate than sex, and when Catharina begs her husband to paint her, his answer is more painful than adultery.
The film has a weakness: Firth. The British comedy veteran is a stooped-over failure as Vermeer, his constipated, oatmeal expressions passing for mercury. When Vermeer is supposed to ignite a passion in Griet, we can only believe it because Johannson, in breathless hyperventilation, sells it so well. One ""intense"" moment, where Vermeer meets Griet on the street in a hat the size of a Honda, is unintentionally funny.
And yet the final half-hour of ""Girl With Pearl Earring,"" most of it involving Firth, gains momentum.  Serra's camera becomes unmoored from its station and begins to bear down on its subjects with zooms and pans, the best of which frame Johannson as the painting will. It is a remarkable shot, and Johannson holds the pose. She does not much look like the girl in the painting, but she is the girl. So it goes, I'd argue, with acting.",1084060800,,4114,4.893982808022923

The story concerns Vermeer's household and a young servant who is sympathetic to his artistic sensibility though she is constrained by gender and class strictures as well as the hostile family environment.
DVD extras are minimal -- a music video and the cable show Anatomy of a Scene on the movie's banquet scene.  The film can be heard in English with English or Spanish subtitles.",1084060800,,594,4.813725490196078
2007261,4,B0001K2L4W,"I've read a lot of reviews that said that this was a dull movie, which makes me believe that perhaps we need more Ritalin in the water system.  This movie took a familiar, simple story, and made it beautiful, complex, and restrained.  The seduction of a servant girl that provokes jealousy in the master's wife was perhaps the kernel of the story, but the way that the story refused to unfold completely made for a very pleasant, taut movie.  Colin Firth seemed at first to have a one note role of quiet brooder, but his delight in Griet's grasp of the foundations of art amended my initial disappointment.  Tom Wilkinson was fabulous as usual, and I was transfixed by Cillian Murphy's cheekbones.  As for Scarlett Johansson... I continue my worship of her subtlety, restraint, and frugality of emotion.

As many others have said, it was a gorgeous movie.  Beautiful light, colors, set, costumes, and of course, Johansson, who proved to be a perfect muse for Firth's Vermeer.  I believe that Webber was actually trying to mimic the way that Vermeer tried to capture domestic scenes, and he succeeded admirably.  It was a very interior movie, as was much of Vermeer's art, and it worked best while it remained inside the home.

It's been a long time since I read Chevalier's novel, so I can't remember how well it represented it, which may be to my benefit, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would watch it again just to watch the maid throw chickens around in the kitchen.  9 out of 10.",1084060800,,1485,4.6513409961685825

With this aside, I did enjoy the movie version. Standing alone, I felt that it did very well depicting the relationship between Griet and Vermeer. I wanted to fall in love with Pieter everytime he was on the screen. Van Rijven is a disgusting (...), Catharina is a jealous (...) and I wanted to slap Cornelia every chance that I could get. Whereas in the book we heard Griet's thoughts, the movie did a very good job of bringing to life these thoughts and actually making you feel like you know what is going on in Griet's head.
I would reccomend anyone to see this movie at least once. And if you want to read the book too, read it after watching the movie, then watch the movie again. The book adds a lot to the story, but your expectations will be too high after reading such a wonderful book. It's like looking at a Vermeer, then watching a reprodution by another artist that leaves out what you fell in love with in the original.",1084060800,,1146,4.334883720930232
2007263,5,B0001K2L4W,"Having seen exhibits of Vermeer's work, I was floored by the perfection of the art direction and cinematography that recreated his luminous interiors and portraits for this film.  The camera's gaze has never before lingered so lovingly on a pair of eyes and lips illuminated by a shaft of light from a slightly dingy window.  But the brilliant surface belies repressive and treacherous domestic circumstances which entrap the young servant whose portrait becomes a timeless masterpiece.  It is not only the servant, but indeed Vermeer's entire household, who are but ""flies in the web"" of Vermeer's wealthy patron.  The gritty depiction of class oppression and domestic abuse are mitigated only slightly by the spark of a connection between Vermeer and the servant girl, who has an innate appreciation of art, and in another century may well have been a painter herself.  I respect the film for not trying to be too uplifting, and instead focusing on the fact that great art transcends our pitiable human condition.",1083974400,2,1015,5.090361445783133
2007264,3,B0001K2L4W,"This movie was the most visually beutifull movie I have ever seen, but maybe it's just me, the things that made the book such a joy were to my dismay, changed for the movie. The opening scene with Griet grouping the ingrediants for soup, definitely should not have been left out!! Though the scene was there showing Griet, Vemeer's vital prescence was completely cut out. For me this showed the connection between between this young girl, and the mature artist, and made the connection  beween the two apparent. The way Vemeer recognized in Griet a kindred spirit if you will, or just someone with the same sensibilities and eye as himself is what drove me through the book in a day and a half. Also you got the sense of his wife's unease with this young girl, seeing her as a possible threat due to the fact she seems to share his artistic eye. This is an area that she has been virtually shut out of, the vital realm of his art, the thing most important thing to him. I saw that as the ultimate threat that Griet posed to the wife not the seeming sexual, sensual threat. The thought that this lowly girl was connecting with Vemeer's mind and his eyes was I thought the crucial point of conflict or tension. Maybe it would have been to difficult to portray something that was solely in their minds, so the filmmakers choose to make it more of a physical thing. I guess we have been reduced to an audiance unable to pickup on the mental without bringing up the physical. IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK, PLEASE DO, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! Over all this was and excelent movie I just was disappointed that the story was reduced to having to hit you over the head with a hammer to portray what was easily displayed in the book with less overt action.",1083974400,,1751,4.421052631578948
2007275,5,B0001K2L4W,"Girl With A Pearl Earring, based on Tracy Chevalier's novel of the same name, chronicles the creation of one of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer's greatest paintings. Griet (the luminous Scarlett Johansson) becomes a maid at the Vermeer house after a family tragedy, and learns to adapt to the dynamics of the Vermeer household: a jealous, constantly-pregnant wife (Essie Davis, bearing a striking resemblance to Cate Blanchett's Queen Elizabeth), a shrewd mother-in-law in charge of finances and keeping Johannes' wandering in check, and a gaggle of children underfoot (one of whom hates Griet from day one and makes life miserable for her). While at the Vermeers, Griet meets Pieter, the butcher's assistant, and the two begin a slow courtship as the seasons pass.
The film's main story follows Vermeer's struggle to paint (he only produced around 35 canvases his entire career) with little money for supplies and the household, an iron-fisted mother-in-law that disdains him and urges him to paint more and faster, and the frustration at being with people who do not understand his calling, the intricacies of colour, texture, light and shadow. Enter Griet, who possesses a sensitive, artistic nature and is assigned to clean Vermeer's studio. Before long she is secretly grinding and mixing paints for Vermeer in between her other household chores, and one fateful day Vermeer asks Griet to sit for him. She does so reluctantly, afraid to invoke the wrath of his wife, but Vermeer quietly forces her to bend to his will, including piercing her ears so that she can wear his wife's earrings for the painting. Griet is found out, and all hell breaks loose. The film's finest moment is when Griet poses for the infamous painting, a haunted look in her liquid eyes. ""You have looked inside me,"" she accuses Vermeer.
There is a great deal of unrealized sexual tension between maid and master, the smallest movement an expression of unspoken desire: the accidental brush of a hand, a thumb's caress as an earring is put in, the furtive glimpse of Griet's hair that entrances Johannes. One of Vermeer's regular patrons lusts after Griet and attempts to rape her, leaving Vermeer angry but helpless to turn down the commission.
This is a gorgeous film, lushly sensual and full of moments of quiet beauty. Each scene is composed as though a Vermeer painting, careful studies in placement, colour, and light.  Colin Firth plays a superbly tortured soul seeking his muse, and Scarlett Johansson is radiant as the timid, blossoming Griet, tantalized by that which she can never have. Slow to unfold but deliciously rewarding, and one of the best films of the last few years.",1083801600,,2663,5.024886877828054

2007277,5,B0001K2L4W,"Even though this movie is based on a fictional account, I found ""Girl with an Earring"" fascinating movie.  If for nothing else, one should 'study' this film for its gorgeous play of light and shadows to create that picturesque setting which was uniquely 17th century Dutch, and which defined Vermeer as one of the greats of his era.  However, what defined this movie for me was the ending.  Some reviewers complain that it was vastly underrated, especially compared to the twisted and dramatic finish of the book from which this movie is based on, but I found it rather suitable when, soon after, the movie comes to a complete end with a still of the painting itself.  For me, it was as if the movie was saying: ""take a look, and tell me how betrayed she must have felt when she got the earrings; and glean from that how warm and full of hope she must have felt while she was sitting for the painting itself.""  perhaps others may interpret it different, but, after the 90 min movie, my perception of Vermeer's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" was both completed and reinforced - a girl full of hope for the future, represented in subtle eloquence with a single earring.  It was one of the few movies for which I did not regret my time.",1082592000,4,1230,4.46875
2007278,5,B0001K2L4W,"That's the big thing I respond to in this movie: Griet locked in a loneliness she can't even name, a visual senstivity that no one around her can share. You see that loneliness first in that opening scene, where she arranges the colors of beets, cabbage, and onion into a composition that only she can see. When her family falls into unfortunate times, she must leave to make her own way in the world. There, just a few minutes in, we see her standing in a compass rose and symbolically choosing her new direction.

That new direction leads her to Vermeer, and to a realization that she is not alone. She can converse with him - not always through talking - about light, color, and composition. And he responds. It's a chaste but intense kind of intimacy. Vermeer's wife is jealous, as if Griet is taking her place in some way. The jealousy is well founded but Griet's relationship to Vermeer is one that his wife can never fill, something that can only add bitterness to the jealousy. Partly though the spiteful viciousness of a daughter in the household, Griet is cast out. In the closing scene, she stands in the middle of the compass rose again, uncertain for a moment, then off in the direction of the next stage of her life.

The movie is beautifully filmed, even if Scarlett Johansson is not shown as an outwardly beautiful woman. If anything, she is shown as somewhat lumpish, as if to emphasize that her beauty is inward. And, despite her generally passive and obedient role, Griet does take charge of what she can. At one point, she realizes that her virginity will probably be taken by force. She is powerless against forcible attack, but discharges her virginity in the manner of her own choosing. Maybe she couldn't lose it to love, but should could save it from violence by giving it in affection. And no, she didn't give it to Vermeer. That relationship already had an intensity of a different order.

If you want absolute historical veracity, you won't find it here. According to ""Vermeer's Camera,"" for example, the camera obscura was probably a whole closet rather than the box shown in this movie. So let it be fiction in a historical setting - it's a beautiful movie, and a depiction of a very real kind of loneliness. At least, it's real to me.

2007279,4,B0001K2L4W,"Scarlett Johansson continues to impress me. From Ghost World to Lost In Translation she tends to hover on the outskirts of mainstream movie greatness. This film surprises you- surprises you with its goodness. Its quiet and beautiful. At first, I was skeptical. The film opens with sets and locations that look fabricated and the lighting seems artificial at best. As the film progresses, the design concept becomes clear. The film is a painting. Each scene is a portrait the cinematography is photographic- note the composition and lighting. Even the story itself is told just as much  if not more through the eyes and looks than the dialogue. The sexual tension and animosity weighs on the screen like a fire blanket- but the movie doesn not drag. Each pregnant pause merely enriches the scene. You must experience this film.

the acting is also superb.  there is nuance in every performance, although i did keep wishing johannson would keep her mouth shut a bit more often.  judy parfitt, as vermeer's mother-in-law, is wonderful.  and vermeer would really have shaved and combed his hair more often than firth does.  this was the 17th century, not the 21st.
but the plot...oh, my, the plot.
it is completely 20th (yes, 20th, not 21st) century, and middle-class suburban.  it is cliched.  it is anachronistic.  it is BORING.  the best part of the plot is vermeer's mother-in-law's efforts to keep him earning, and the lengths she is willing to go in order to preserve her family's home and status (and not from pride, but because her grandchildren need to eat and bankruptcy meant more horror that most of the movie's viewers could ever imagine). but the rest of the plot--the wife's jealousy of the servant, the lecherous patron's pursuit, the 'my-wife-doesn't-understand-my genius' nonsense, the malicious pre-teen troublemaker, the disappointed suitor--haven't all these elements been done to death, as well as being not necessarily all that true to the period?  especially griet's sexual awakening and experimentation.  to repeat, this was the 17th century. attitudes were very different.

2007281,2,B0001K2L4W,"Everything important that happens in GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING happens on Scarlett Johansson's face. In the role of Griet, a servant girl in the home of Johannes Vermeer(Colin Firth), Johannsson gives a delicately worked out interior performance that equals if not betters her work in LOST IN TRANSLATION.
  It's too bad that the movie can't keep up with her. Based on Tracy Chevalier's novel, GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is an imagining of how the titular painting came to be. The Vermeer house is in an uproar, under constant pressure to please the artist's wealthy patron (Tom Wilkinson, hammy). Vermeer's large family seems almost entirely concerned with superficialities, while the artist, who Firth plays rather sullenly, toils away on commissions. Griet is the only one who understands the play of color and light that moves Vermeer, and Johansson beautifully gets the girl's sensual (and later sexual) awakening. Griet's character is much too obviously a modern imagining of what a 17th century house servant SHOULD have been like. By the end of the film, it seems that her nascent artistic impulses and sexuality have come to life, never mind the fact that she's poor, unemployed, and illiterate. . The ""journey"" Griet goes on gives the film what little dramatic shape it has -- there's much too little incident. Subplots -- Wilkinson's character's lecherous designs on Griet, Vermeer's daughter's jealousy of Griet -- are started and then forgotten about. Johansson handles everything with a beautiful light touch though, and certainly manages to be moving despite the narrowly conceived role.
  Despite Johansson's work and the gorgeous costumes and cinematography, I can't quite recommend this one.",1078358400,15,1708,5.245421245421245

I felt that I had seen a major display of the Vermeer style: the scenery, the colors, the detail of everyday living at Delft in the late 1660's and, of course, the girl herself. I thought only Scarlett Johansson could have played the role.  We need more films of this quality!",1077321600,13,368,4.397058823529412
2007293,5,B0001K2L4W,"The shimmering city of Delft leaps from the pages of Tracy Chevalier's delicately descriptive novel onto the screen in the film 'Girl With a Pearl Earring'. 17th century Holland is recreated with breathtaking splendor. From the folds of the dresses to the attitudes of the day, the film stays in character and does not add Hollywood gimmicks to modernize the tale. Servants are servile and illiterate, though not necessarily unintelligent. The titular teenage maid does not have an insolent attitude.
Scarlett Johansson plays the young Griet, the daughter of a former tile painter who is sent across town to serve the Vermeer household. Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), a painter, is drawn to Griet's quiet loveliness. Though few words pass between them, their mutual eye for aesthetics develops into strong attraction and deep appreciation. Her pure complexion also attracts Vermeer's vulgar patron, Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) and the young butcher Pieter (Cillian Murphy).

Each frame is a painting within itself, supported by a charming score (though some have called the music obnoxious). Though every scene is beautiful, Griet's position is not romanticized; her arduous labor is evident throughout the movie. Instead of altering the story to conform to a 95 minute film, sections of the story are simply deleted or unexplained. Particularly the character of Tanneke is underdeveloped, compared to the book character.
The acting is dramatic yet understated. Expressions are affectively portrayed without losing subtlety. Johansson expressively displays the young, almost timid side of Griet. Colin Firth is an attractive Vermeer; he has natural and exciting reactions. Tom Wilkinson is surprisingly low key as Van Ruijven, compared to the character in the novel; however, he still manages to be repulsive. Essie Davis's performance is also a standout as Vermeer's insecure wife, Catharina.
'Girl With a Pearl Earring' establishes its setting in an unforgettable light, and the story has enough magic to satisfy the patient viewer. Might I add that Cillian Murphy is beautiful.",1077148800,227,2081,5.442724458204334
2007294,4,B0001K2L4W,"Peter Webber's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is a visual treat, using golden hues to create a soft, vintage look in both the interiors and the exteriors, the city of Delft.  The cast, led by Colin Firth as the Dutch painter Vermeer, is superb.  A great deal of feelings and depth is conveyed without dialogue.
The viewer will be swept up by the painter so devoted to his art;  his jealous, pretty wife who is burdened by many pregnancies; the innocent young girl who knows she must tread carefully in this turbulent household; the wife's mother who must shrewdly manage the business of selling the paintings.
Although reviewers might use the word ""subtle"" to describe this visually grand film, it is also curiously overwrought and heavy, like the tantrums of the wife, and somewhat exhausting to watch.  A minor criticism:  the actress playing the young girl, although fresh and dewey, doesn't much resemble the girl in the real painting, whose more finely wrought features might reflect more intelligence and depth.",1076889600,4,1014,4.9411764705882355
2007295,3,B0001K2L4W,"I rather liked this little movie.  It's beautifully filmed, well-crafted, evokes a nice sense of time & place, has believably restrained performances by the entire cast (though Tom Wilkinson is a bit heavy-handed), and offers a plausible (if entirely conjectural) story about Vermeer and the subject of his luminous painting. Colin Firth's Vermeer is a weak householder enraptured with the new maid, Griet (Scarlett Johannson), who is not only lovely but also shares his ability to see the beauty in things.  Their performances are competent, but neither is given much to work with in the screenplay.  The real star performance is given by Judy Parfitt, absolutely splendid as the Machiavellian mother-in-law who keeps her daughter's jealous temper in check, while manipulating artist, patron, and servant to ensure the survival of her home and family.
Though Griet is not a very forthcoming character, we have no doubt about her virtues and find it easy to sympathize with her plight as a powerless young woman anxious to avoid becoming the prey of a powerful would-be protector.  The story is hardly new, but it's told fairly well in this film. Director Peter Webber is content simply to show the conditions of her life and not insult our intelligence with needless editorializing.
I would give it 3 1/2 stars if possible, for I liked it's craftsmanship and Parfitt's performance very much, yet the story is slight and its aims rather modest.  Still, it's significantly superior to the boring amalgamations of explosions, car chases, gunplay, irresponsible sex, sophomoric repartee, stock characters, and stale plot elements that masquerade as entertainment at most cineplexes these days.  GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is a movie made for literate adults, not for teenaged-boys challenged by anything more subtle than Quake III, and well worth at least 3 solid stars.",1076889600,7,1866,5.203333333333333
2007296,5,B0001K2L4W,"Tracy Chevalier's best-selling novel has been become a glowingly beautiful film to be enjoyed as a fine work of art.  The fictional story behind Dutch master Vermeer's painting is a simple and quiet one, but Director Peter Webber has infused it with mesmerizing beauty.

Scarlett Johansson plays Griet, a young maid who comes to work in the Vermeer household, where she must contend with a jealous and temperamental mistress, a bratty child, and the mysterious artist himself.  Colin Firth portrays Vermeer as a perpetually brooding, demanding, and ultimately spineless phantom who cares only for his art.  Griet must also handle with diplomacy the unwelcome advances of the artist's patron, while unsure of her feelings for the attentive young butcher.

The story is slight and almost secondary to the photography here.  Each frame of the movie is filmed with an emphasis on a warm, natural light source that fills each scene with a radiant glow.  I found myself holding my breath while watching the film, as one does in the presence of sheer loveliness.

Johannsson is perfect as the young maid and Firth seethes with intensity.  The richly detailed recreation of 17th century Delft (filmed in Luxembourg) is a feast for the eyes.  The music enhances the mood of uncertainty and unspoken desire.  This is a rare and wonderful film.",1076198400,10,1333,5.041095890410959
2007297,5,B0001K2L4W,"There are films about painters (""Lust for Life"") and painting (""The Agony and the Ecstasy""), but it is rare to find a film about the art of painting, and that is one of the great strengths of ""Girl with a Pearl Earring.""  The film is based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier, with a screenplay by Olivia Hetreed, that imagines a whole story behind Johannes Vermeer's painting, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" (1665-66) involving the Dutch painter, his family, and the model he used for what is his most famous and most intriguing painting.
Griet (Scarlett Johannson), is a young girl from a Calvinist family who has to seek employment as a maid in the Roman Catholic household of the famous painter.  She is given her duties, one of which is to clean the upstairs studio, but only when the master is not busy painting.  Even Vermeer's wife, Catharine (Essie Davis) will not enter that place, for reasons we will learn about later.  Before she meets the artist (peter Firth), Griet sees his current painting, ""Woman with a Pearl Necklace"" (1664-65) and we can tell from her eyes that she is looking at something wondrous.
We know that Griet is no fool, because she refuses to accept bad meat from the local butcher, which causes his son, Pieter (Cillian Murphy), to notice her.  But in the house she is beneath notice, told not to speak until spoken to first.  One day she asks the ladies of the house, Catharina and her mother, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), if when she is cleaning the studio if she should do the windows.  Her concern is that doing so would change the light.  The women look at her without comprehension and Catharina tells her to go ahead and clean the windows.  For Maria these are just paintings, things that allow her son-in-law to make money, but for Griet they are something else, and it while cleaning the windows in the corner of the studio that Vermeer used in most of his paintings, that the artists sees her and discovers a new source of inspiration.
The fact that neither his perpetually pregnant wife nor his coin counting mother-in-law has any appreciation for art explains in large part why Vermeer is drawn to Griet.  She might not be able to read but he asks her what color are the clouds, she knows the obvious answer is not right for a painter and comes up with the correct one.  But then when Vermeer shows her the canvas he is working on, ""Young Woman with a Water Pitcher"" (1994-65), she knew that the colors were all wrong, and he explains why.
This is a film in which the most erotic moment comes when we finally see Griet's hair, although others might disagree and find mixing paints to be the height of the film's sexuality.  But I tended to dismiss such things because I find ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" to be about an intimacy that transcends the mere physical realm of sex (the actual painting is of intimate size, 18 by 16 inches).  Whatever feelings they might have for each other have to be expressed in other ways, because this is a film that has its sensibilities firmly set in the world of art in the 17th century.  Besides, the venality of man is amply represented by Vermeer's patron, the wealthy businessman Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson).
Ultimately the film comes down to not just the girl, but to the pearl earring, which belongs to Catharine, but which Vermeer insists must be dangling from Griet's ear in the portrait.  Griet knows this is going too far, but we know that she cannot deny him in the end, especially since we have seen the finished painting, which is one of the most beguiling in art history this side of ""The Mona Lisa.""  But also because she is given a push in a somewhat surprising move by one of the characters.  The notion that if this is romance it is of a transcendent type that cannot be judged by normal rules.  He immortalizes her in a painting and what does she do in return?  She lets him pierce her ear and of equal importance, she moves a chair.  I so admire films that can work on that lyrical a level.
This 2003 film has been nominated for Oscars for Cinematography Eduardo Serra, Art Direction, set director Ben van Os and set decorator Cecile Heidman, and Costume Design by Dien van Straalen.  All clearly take their inspiration from Vermeer's paintings.  The lighting throughout the film reflects that of Vermeer's studio, which means it never looks quite as good when we are elsewhere, because the studio is the heart of the film.  Tanneke (Joanna Scanlan), the family maid, looks like ""The Milkmaid"" (1958-60) and Vermeer's wife at one point is costumed exactly like ""Woman in Blue Reading a Letter"" (1663-64).
Like the painting from which it takes its name and whose enduring image naturally ends the film, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is Quiet and contemplative.  The entire story is speculative because little is known about Vermeer besides his 35 painting, and whether his model for this one was his daughter, a neighbor, or a tradeswoman, no one will ever know.  But it is impossible not to look at this painting without wondering who this girl was and what thoughts are going through her mind.
Johannson's performance commands the film, although she is seldom required to speak and rarely asked what she might be thinking.  Parfitt as the true power in the Vermeer household offers the other stellar performance, while Firth's dazzling charm from other films is sublimated to his character's artistic temperament.  Of course, the greatest compliment that can be paid to first time director Peter Webber is that he has crafted this film with the same care that Vermeer used in painting his own canvases.",1076198400,23,5592,4.65650406504065
2007298,4,B0001K2L4W,"Girl with a Pearl Earring is a fictionalized account of what lead the artist Vermeer to paint the painting of the same name. The real events around the painting are unknown, so the movie is all conjecture. That being said, it is a plausible story. Griet, as a teenager, goes to work for Vermeer's family as a maid. Her parents cannot support her and this is how she is to take care of herself. Vermeer himself is the only member of the family that actually likes her, and she often helps him prepare his painting supplies as well as cleans his studio. Van Rujiven, Vermeer's patron develops an overly strong liking to Griet, and eventually commissions a painting of her which leads to a very tense household. Fine acting all around fills this interesting story of what could have been behind the creation of this painting.",1075852800,3,822,4.636986301369863
2007299,3,B0001K2L4W,"At least I wasn't the woman five rows down with a snoring husband on her hands....
Instead I was the woman who, upon leaving the theatre, didn't quite know how to feel about this film. After reading all of the glowing reviews for it, though, I must say that I feel rather guilty for not rating it as highly. Understand, I have no set criterea for what makes a good movie, really. If it touches me or entertains me, if it shows me something I've never seen before or perhaps teaches me something, it was worth the time and money spent. In all honesty, I'm not sure that I can say that 'Girl With a Pearl Earring' did any of those things.
The main reason for seeing it, I must admit, was to watch Colin Firth. He's a fine and compelling--not to mention often underrated--actor. And he has a wonderful knack for pulling off period characters. Plus, he does 'brooding' very well. And the second reason for seeing it was for its theme/concept. I love speculative fiction that involves art, though I've never read the novel upon which this movie is based. For the first reason I was paid back in spades. For the second...not so much.
The movie's backdrop was spectacular. As other's have noted, the color and the light were just beautiful. A particular scene comes to mind--when Griet is walking with the butcher's son through what I suppose was some kind of park or forested area and the light was golden and subdued--and it was just so surreal and evocative...I felt like I could touch it as though that one scene was nothing more than a still, a canvas with paint that had been applied so lush and thick. But exquisite scenery couldn't help the pacing and even though the story needed to build slowly, it grew a bit tedious. Especially since a lot of the film is caught in some kind of hush. There is very little dialogue and even music is used sparingly.
There is no denying the intimacy between Vermeer as portrayed by Firth and Griet. It was lovely to watch. But...I guess, for me, it wasn't enough that that intimacy stood as the substance of the film.
By the time it drew to its conclusion, my companion was frustrated by its lack of, well, a conclusion. It is very open-ended and you are left to your own devices in figuring out what road Griet has taken. You are not entirely sure where it is ending and what has happened to many of the players. As I understand it, the book finishes a little bit more definitely than the film. For some, the obscurity of the ending could be a little bit of a put off.
I wouldn't say that one should not see this movie. Though I can't say I would recommend it heartily either. I know that once the credits were scrolling by I felt nothing. I had no immediate response (which was odd because I thought I surely would) and I couldn't have given anyone a definite ""yes, I liked it"" or ""no, I didn't"" if they were to ask me right then. Perhaps my expectations were just too high.",1075593600,31,2912,4.404452690166976
2007300,4,B0001K2L4W,"I'm a Colin Firth fan.  I'm a Scarlett Johansson fan.  I figured ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" would be a slam-dunk.  At times though, watching 'Pearl' is like watching the paint dry on one of Vermeer's 35 paintings.
I can appreciate the intelligent take on things. And, I understand about the need to set up the dramatic tension in the household and the repressed sexual chemistry between Griet and Vermeer.  But not having Firth not utter his first word until 30 minutes into the film seems to be a waste of his talents, as does garbing him in an ill-fitting wig.
The money shot is getting Johansson into the 'Pearl Earring' model pose.  When the moment finally arrives, it's electric stuff.  Without any specific effects at all, Johansson is the spitting image of Vermeer's original model.  My protestations to the contrary, seeing that one moment of the film is worth the wait and the money.",1075161600,4,893,4.72258064516129
2007301,5,B0001K2L4W,"Before seeing it, the film seems straightforward. Just about a girl with pearl earring in her ear lobe, right? No. The film tries to look deeper into Vermeer's stunning painting by offering Chevalier's interpretation of who the young girl was. However, where the film succeeds is flexibly creating a tentative but emotionally explosive relationship between master and servant - Firth and Johansson.
Set in 17th century in the Netherlands, the film begins calmly, carefully unravelling itself to the viewer so that one can absorb it visually and mentally. The pace can be seen as slow but this type of film needs that type of pace to make it work because if it was fast, how could we as the viewers enjoy the tentative, innocent and beautiful love that Griet and Vermeer share?
Scarlett Johansson plays Griet, the quiet and demure Dutch maid that invokes anger, jealousy and confusion in Catherina's heart (Essie Davis) while indirectly capturing Johannes Vermeer's attention (Colin Firth) and Master van Ruijven sleazy eye (acted with pure sinisterness by Tom Wilkinson). In one aspect, what ensues makes the film very good in my eyes because it portrays the issues of the impressive supporting cast such as Cornelia's blatant antagonism towards Griet, Catherina's undeniable envy and Pieter's unrequited interest in Griet while simultaneously using them as a platform to present the perfect example of repressed love between two people who know that they are worlds apart.
Johansson was simply magnificent in this film. I will be surprised and annoyed if she does not get an Oscar nomination because she played this part with such precision, it is hard to see another woman who could match her emotive performance.
Firth always delivers but this time, he was sublime. Like Johansson in terms of intensity, Firth was outstanding as the pensive but caring painter who appeared as if he was preoccupied with a certain someone.
The brilliance of this film does not only stem from the actors, the cinematography is a visual feast for the eyes and the soundtrack fits the shy mood of the film.
Slight apprehension before walking into the cinema. Delight after enjoying it, Frustration that Firth & Johansson are meant to be but as fate wants, do not find their way to each other.",1074902400,24,2274,5.018518518518518
2007302,5,B0001K2L4W,"What quietly compelling 2003 movie stars Scarlett Johansson and an older leading man having a platonic relationship in an exquisitely photographed, meticulously designed foreign locale? If you said, ""Lost in Translation,"" you'd be right, but if you said, ""Girl With a Pearl Earring,"" you'd also win the cigar. That ""Lost in Translation"" may be the second-best of the two indicates that ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" deserves nothing but the highest praise. Johansson stars as Griet, a poor, illiterate young woman in 17th-century Delft who hires on as a maid in the household of the rising young painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). Slowly the moody, obsessed Vermeer begins to recognize in Griet a kindred spirit--someone who, though untutored, has a natural feeling for light, color and design. But their friendship is blighted from the start, thanks to Vermeer's jealous wife (Essie Davis), greedy mother-in-law (Judy Parfitt) and lustful patron (Tom Wilkinson). The performances are all quietly effective; the jury's still out on Johansson's range as an actress, but she is a singularly moving screen presence, and the camera adores her. Also deserving note are Davis, who makes Madame Vermeer both hateful and pitiable; Parfitt, a specialist in the portrayal of dragon mothers; and Cillian Murphy as Griet's boyfriend Pieter, a heartthrob in the making, who looks startlingly like the young Rudolf Nureyev. But the real stars of the production are the team of director Peter Webber, photographer Eduardo Serra and production designer Ben Van Os. Thanks to them, ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" glows with a passionate beauty. Every single frame of the film looks like a Vermeer painting in motion, and the moment at which Griet poses for the eponymous painting will take your breath away with its perfection. Except perhaps for Tavernier's ""A Sunday in the Country,"" I can't think of another feature film that brings art so vividly to life as ""Girl With a Pearl Earring.""",1074902400,68,1973,5.1880877742946705
