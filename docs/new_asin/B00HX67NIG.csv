8637065,4,B00HX67NIG,"More work from the ever experimental James Benning, as finally a few of his films make it onto DVD. Until this series of releases, one was forced to watch 3rd rate copies on YouTube, or wait in hope that the local art museum might show a retrospective.

Benning is not easy. His films are sometimes glacial in pace. But they also show an intelligence and insight that can make sitting through them worth the effort. I rarely flat out love his films, but I'm almost always glad I've seen them, and the best reveal more layers on repeated viewings.

My thoughts on these two:

Deseret: Very interesting. Benning takes striking images of modern day Utah  both landscapes and civilization, and overlays them with a series of news stories read aloud from The New York Times, following Utahs history from the 1840s to the 1980s. A fascinating history lesson, full of contradictions (Mormon leaders often come off as monsters, but occasionally seem far more sane and kind than the world around them) the echoes between the images and the history, knowing that the people were hearing about lived and dies on the lands were looking at make all sorts of poetic connections about the land, the news media, religion, the nature of progress. Never boring, it somehow just missed greatness for me, perhaps because the more emotional layer I kept expecting never quite hit.

Four Corners; This didn't have quite the same level of impact on me as its sister film Deseret. Using the famous spot where 4 southwestern states meet, Benning uses a combination of landscapes to study 4 paintings by 4 very different artists to study how art relates to the natural world, ethnic and class history, American political history, the despoiling of the land, etc, etc. And its the etc. etc that made this tough for me on first viewing. Unlike Deseret, this seemed to be trying to cover so many things and themes, that I ended up a bit lost, not quite sure how all the pieces tied together. Ironically, in other spots, perhaps because Benning didn't have as much time to go into each element hes exploring, the statements felt more simplistic and heavy handed than Im used to with Bennings work.",1452470400,,2167,4.752659574468085
