8105460,5,B000E3TU0Y,Very informative....although the video was filmed several years ago.  It was a good introduction prior to our Copper Canyon trip as it gave us an idea of the wonderful experience we had ahead.,1416182400,,192,4.818181818181818
8105461,5,B000E3TU0Y,"By paying the exharbant price for this dvd(about three times its value)I saved hundreds..you see, this dvd showed me that Copper Canyon was not at all what I wanted and did not make the trip..so your dvd saved me a lot of pain and money..so I guess it was well worth paying the outragous price of $50 plus shipping.
