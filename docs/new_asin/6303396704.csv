7845052,2,6303396704,"The movie has a good start. It fails to maintain the initial energy and suspense, and falls apart after the first ten minutes, becoming a lack-luster bore.

What is the movie about? Greed, conspiracy, cross and double-cross as Ben Algood, husband of Bo Derek's character, is presumably kidnapped. Oh no, oh woe. Who cares? Not Bo.",1300579200,,330,4.892857142857143
7845053,2,6303396704,"The 1994 release of Shattered Image followed on the heel's of 1993's Women of Desire and is similar in storyline. Both star the beautiful if somewhat acting ability limited Bo Derek as a woman involved in a murder mystery involving her late husband. Image has Bo as a former famous model married to a beast of a man who runs a modeling agency. David McCallum gets to act like a bully and jerk in his scenes and instantly makes you glad that he gets kidnapped. Enter hunky FBI maverick(is there any other kind ? ) Brian played also very woodenly by Jack Scalia(and his ripped torso).Brian seems to be a loose cannon who's methods piss off his FBI supervisors. Anyhow the kidnappers demand 5 million dollars for husband Ben's safe return and enclose one of Ben's fingers in a box to show they mean buisness. Credit Bo for actually looking shocked when she opens the box and sees the severed finger who said she can't act ? Enter Ben's brother/buisness partner and Bo's secret lover David played by John Savage. Brian and his partner Velez start to get suspious about this whole thing. Unfortunatly for agent Velez he gets killed by fleeing kidnappers before he can act on any hunches he may have had. This makes agent Brian very angry and he vows to get to the bottom of this case. The rest of the movie involves his following the lovely Bo around. Getting romatically involved with her,fighting his FBI boss and finally reaching the grand finale. The twists and turns in the plot are many and lead to a few holes as well. You kind of hope that Bo's character isn't as duplicious as she seems as she does come off as likeable. Savages David comes off as a conniving little brother jealous of big bro type. Scalia's acting limitations hurt his ability to make you really want to see him win the day. He looks model buff and shows off his guns and pecs quite often but he's just not a belivable character. As for the real reason a person watches a Bo Derek movie THE NUDITY (c'mon admit it you ! )There's some but really it's quite tame when compared to Woman of Desire. Maybe it was a nod to Bo's age (she was in her late 30's) but there's only 1 love scene and a quick jacuzzi romp as well. Bo looks awesome even today in her 50's she still beautiful. The chemistry beween Bo and Jack's characters is passable especially compared to Bo and Savages lack of chemistry. Nobody would buy a hottie like Bo bedding down with a dweeb like David. In the end Shattered Image is a flawed film .But it isn't awful and is worth a night's viewing. Please note that this is an import dvd looked like a VHS transfer. The movie hits a snag briefly but overall it looks good.",1240531200,5,2656,4.422448979591837
7845054,2,6303396704,"An ongoing and tiresome motif occurring in many contemporary films pertains to dissension within the ranks of law enforcement agencies with the leading player being some kind of maverick when called to account by his lieutenant, captain, chief or whomever, upbraided for his wayward ways, yet grudgingly given a final opportunity for redemption ere his career is permanently struck down by his choleric supervisor. In this movie, the ultimatum is administered to FBI agent Brian Dillon (Jack Scalia) whose probable final assignment will be an attempt to solve the kidnapping of a wealthy clothing manufacturer whose wife Helen, acted with her customary minute dramatic range by Bo Derek, does not try to disguise abhorrence of her abducted husband, Ben. When Ben is purportedly murdered by the kidnappers, the Bureau closes the case, but meantime Brian and the ungrieving widow have become lovers, a situation complicated by such issues as fraud, embezzlement, and the persistent presence of David (John Savage), Helen's ex-lover and also brother of her late spouse. In addition to the obvious closed space behind Derek's baby blues, the work is burdened with fatal flaws, especially a scenario that is rife with unfillable holes in its plotting for which a plethora of twists and turns are not compensatory, as the scriptor has eliminated the requisite component of suspense. Scalia is pleasing as ever, creating and improving his scenes, however, Carol Lawrence has a majority of her footage cut, unfortunate as she enlivens the action, in particular when paired with somnolent Derek; generous budgeting is utilized to good advantage by making the film look and sound good, and able efforts are turned in by cinematographer Thomas Del Ruth, designer Alfred Sole, costumer Barbara Palmer, and editor Carl Kress, and the sound mixing is top-notch, all unhappily at the service of an absurd screenplay.",1173916800,,1901,5.2772277227722775
7845055,4,6303396704,"Made for telly film, so judge it by those standards, and under those conditions, you have a nifty neo-noir film.  Former model Helen really detests DH, Ben, only Ben has big stacks of money, and divorce would mean losing the charge cards and fancy life style she adores.  Wanting her cake and eat it, too, she and her brother-in-law, arrange to have him kidnapped, so they can get the money - 5 Million - and freedom.
Things start to go out of control when FBI Agents Dillon and Mallis manager to trace a phone call, and storm the house to rescue Ben.  Something goes wrong - a big fire breaks out and hostage, hired killers and FBI Agent are killed.  They have their suspicions about the whole thing, feeling the wife and brother-in-law were behind it for the ransom.  But they cannot  prove anything, so the case is dropped.
Soon, Helen begins to get phone calls from the dead husband.  Or is he dead?  Nifty plot twists keep this interesting with a powerhouse cast of Bo Derek, Jack Scalia, John Savage, Dorian Harewood, David McCallum, and Ian Ogilvy.",1074038400,,1055,4.574468085106383
7845056,3,6303396704,"Helen and her brother-in-law, David, kidnaps Helen's husband Ben, to get the ransom money from his company. But things don't go as planned and Ben and an FBI agent gets killed. Afterwards, the agent's partner and Helen become friends and, before long, also lovers. But strange things start to happen. Is Ben still alive? Does David have plans of his own? Something is wrong...
This is a grade B thriller made for TV. While not the best movie in the world (I don't think anyone expected it to be), it does its job - to entertain, and does it quite well. It is an entertaining movie with just enough twists in the plot to make it interesting. At least worth renting.",1026345600,3,664,4.4958677685950414
