5733524,5,B00CPTUO1Y,"While it is rarely the case in foreign versions of US movies, the dialogues in The Hot Spot are much more caustic in the French version than in the original (which kind of sounds dull in comparison)

It makes for a much better movie, kudos to the translators for taking the darkness of this film noir to the next level! Now please upgrade the DVD version to BR in French as well.",1391990400,2,379,4.263888888888889
5733525,5,B00CPTUO1Y,"Dang! Dennis Hopper's ""The Hot Spot"" is... here goes... a MASTERPIECE of neo-noir.
A very ""attention to detail"" oriented transfer that looks fabulous with eye candy colors.
He hits all the right buttons and choosing (probably begging) the virtuoso trumpeter Miles Davis to jam his modal riffs over the top of a REAL, down home, legit blues band (ala the Howlin Wolf, Muddy Waters Chicago sounds)... MAN! WHAT.... A.... SOUNDTRACK!

Your ears eat it up - the sound track just moves this film. It is gorgeously photographed, beautiful old home town locations with authentically original antiqued Coca Cola paintings on the building opposite the car dealership.
Rich story, great acting all round, focused direction... Wow... Virginia Madsen is one great femme fatale! WHOA!

Killing Me Softly - now, there are a lot of negative ""critic"" reviews out there and I ALMOST listened to the nearly overwhelming animosity out there against this film and against Heather Graham in particular. However, I think Heather Graham is the REAL DEAL and I respected her WAYYYY back in Drugstore Cowboy and, especially, From Hell.

This movie is NOT at ALL over indulgent regarding the bad-mouthed ""sexual"" aspects of the film. Nothing tortuous, nothing violent, but there IS the HINT... of violence and that HINT is what keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat, ala Hitchcock or, even more so, Brian De Palma's ""Obsession"" and/or ""Black Dahlia"". The cinematography is tops, the director has style and class in the telling of the story and it is not exploitative about ANYTHING.

It's just a darn good film. And... it is a film that you can watch over and over again... not necessarily to learn new things but more to enjoy the beauty of the whole film and all of it's aspects. The costume design is great too... very neo-Mod in London!

The Hot Spot is a very good cross between Postman Ring Twice and Body Heat but the moral; standard but not totally predictable.

Killing Me Softly is a surprising movie; is looks like thriller but it is really something else; better not spoil.

Don Johnson plays his part to the hilt and Jennifer Connelly is really nice eye candy. Virginia Madsen should have received an Oscar for her portrayal of her character. She is very dangerous and very entertaining in a black comedy sort of way. I already owned The Hot Spot on DVD but I wanted it on Bluray. I didn't have to pay much for this bluray so I think it was well worth the price I paid. One more thing, if you like Blues, you will love the Soundtrack in The Hot Spot.

I didn't want the other movie, titled ""Killing Me Softly"", because I had seen it before, and it is awful. Really, truly awful. It's dreck. Two fine actors trapped in movie hell - nothing works in this film. Not the script, not the editing, not the acting, not the directing - nothing.

Video Quality: 3/5

The Hot Spot is directed by Dennis Hopper and adapted to screenplay from the Charles Williams novel, ""Hell Hath No Fury"", by Nona Tyson and Charles Williams. It stars Don Johnson, Virginia Madsen, Jennifer Connelly, Charles Martin Smith and William Sadler. Music is by Jack Nitzsche and cinematography by Ueli Steiger.

Dennis Hopper loves film noir, he has been in some bona fide classic neo-noirs, whilst also turning his hand to directing that style of film making. The Hot Spot may not be a total success as such, but it is a superb effort that lovers of all things noir can feast upon. Story pitches Johnson as drifter Harry Madox, who lands in a Southern state town, bluffs his way into a car salesman job, plots a robbery, and then finds that two local ladies - of very different qualities - are about to change his life forever...

I found my level and I'm living it.

Hopper turns in a honest and faithful tribute to the first wave of film noir, but armed with the fact this was his era of film making relaxations, he gets to sex things up. Blending noir with erotic thriller conventions allows Hopper to pile on plenty of sizzle, which comes in the form of Madsen, who as Dolly Harshaw gives neo-noir one of its finest femme fatales. Overtly sexual and on the surface a ditz, an easy lay, it's only when this part of noirville shows its hand - in true old school fashion - does the character become memorable still further.

On the flip side is Connelly's more straight laced Gloria Harper, who Madox coverts, yet there's baggage there as well (is she virginal?), baggage which adds more potency and trickery to this smouldering hot spot hot-pot. The girls are great, but so is Johnson, he broods and has a raw masculinity most fitting for this type of role. It's a shame he didn't do more neo-noir because he has the tools for the trade. Hopper brings sweat, sweaty close ups and noirville fans, while the photography and musical accompaniments are superbly compliant to the required atmosphere.

The editing is a let down, so many scenes needed to have the linger factor, but it's not enough to kill this fine slice of noir pie. A sexy guy in over his head, devious machinations from both sexes, robbery, arson, deaths, ignorance and stupidity, The Hot Spot is far from being boring! The deliberate slow burn pacing has alienated the casual ""crime/erotic thriller"" film fan, but for those who love and know their noir, the fireplace cinders approach is a joy because the pay off delivers all that we hoped.

Killing Me Soflty

Video Quality: 3/5
Audio Quality: 3/5

Heather Graham, with her enormous blue eyes, long blond hair, and creamy complexion, looks like she comes from the Upper Midwest, which she does, and was brought up on food like corn and peaches and whole milk. She look like a winsome young girl except for her generous bosom, on ample display here. Nobody should kill her, softly or otherwise. She should be cuddled and stroked like a furry little kitten. If nobody else wants to do it, I'll volunteer.

Alas, though, Heather Graham, playing a computer person for a London company, has a problem common to women of this genre. She's living comfortably with a man who loves her but falls for another who carries around with him a cloud of pheromones. She has a lot of company in the role of bored housewife -- Lady Chatterley, Emmanuelle, Anna Karenina, Emma Bovary, and who knows how many others.

Her new lover is Joseph Fiennes. He's mysterious, darkly handsome, needs a shave, wears the smirk of self-confidence, is both a mountain climber and a writer, and makes terrific feral love. What more could any woman ask for? Graham leaves her loving but average boy friend and moves in with Fiennes.

Now, we experienced viewers know very well that when a woman does something like that -- walks out on a dull bulb and marries a symbol of virility that she knows little about -- there's a fly in the ointment somewhere. Fiennes can't be that good. NOBODY can be that good. So it becomes a question, not of whether anything is wrong with him, but exactly WHAT is wrong with him. What secrets is he hiding from her? I certainly don't want to spoil this movie for anyone by giving away the ending, but let me let slip a hint. Fiennes and his sister, Natasha McElhone, are a little too close when judged by the usual norms governing sibling morality, and the death of Fiennes previous wife wasn't exactly as initially presented. She didn't fall off a mountain top. She had her head bashed by a jealous McElhone. Nor is Fiennes exactly the innocent play in these events. He winds up in the slams. I hope that doesn't give away anything.

I bought this blu-ray mostly to take a dekko of Heather Graham's upper torso. It was gratifying. She's just plain splendid. As an addition -- and unexpected pleasure -- I found the story at times so ridiculous as to be comic. When Graham begins to suspect something is up with Fiennes, she begins to PRY INTO HIS PRIVATE THINGS, what the sociologist Erving Goffman called his information preserve. She's looking for letters or something. She isn't sure what. She doesn't have to KNOW what. It is in the nature of wives to SNOOP, as I know all too well. So, pardon me, so here she is banging a lock off Fiennes private cabinet where he stashes his mountain-climbing gear and frantically scattering papers and ropes and pitons around. Downstairs, the door opens. Fiennes is home earlier than expected. He calls her name. In a frenzy she begins stuffing this crap back into the closet whence it came. The camera meanwhile shows us Fiennes dark boots slowly climbing the steps -- one by agonizing one. The musical theme, which has so far been lush and romantic, now becomes menacing. Upstairs Graham finally gets the closet closed and is about to turn and greet Fiennes as he enters the room except that -- no! -- two or three coils of bright blue mountain-climbing rope now extrude from under the closet door. Caught up in a whirlwind of anxiety she begins trying to stuff the coils back out of sight as those ominous dark boots move step by step down the hallway towards the door, behind which -- But enough of that. I was laughing so hard at that one scene that it made the purchase of the DVD worthwhile, quite aside from Heather Graham's seraphic features or jiggling boobs.

But that's my take on it, and before accepting my judgment of the film you ought to take into account the fact that my taste is perverse. I wasn't worried when Fiennes and Graham are naked on the bed and he wraps a long silk scarf around her neck and begins strangling her. Not a bit. I thought it was a little naughty to half-throttle a gorgeous woman but I wasn't concerned because, at that point, the movie was only two-thirds over, so I knew she'd survive intact.

I'm not really sure a normal viewer could survive this movie intact. There are really only three reasons for watching it. Two of them belong to Heather Graham and the third is the amusement quotient involved in watching any familiar ritual play itself out before us, a point of comfort in a changing and disappointing universe.
