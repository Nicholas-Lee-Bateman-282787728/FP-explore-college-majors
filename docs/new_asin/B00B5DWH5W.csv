5559372,5,B00B5DWH5W,It was a great movie. My gf enjoyed watching it together. Loved the ending. I would  definitely watch it again!,1373587200,,111,4.55
5559373,4,B00B5DWH5W,"At first this movie seemed inappropriate, silly, but funny along with overstepping morals/values. The guy seemed like he didn't have common sense with the actions he did cheating on his wife just for his work.  However, by the last part of the movie it ended up continuing to be funny and a twist that was slightly predictable but important and good message.  A great movie to watch with your spouse or significant other. A delightful ending! I ended up glad I watched this movie and I hope you will feel the same way!",1373068800,,518,4.559139784946237
5559374,3,B00B5DWH5W,"Fine acting and a interesting but boring story line makes this movie OK to watch, but not a movie you will want to watch more than one time.",1372982400,,140,4.035714285714286
5559375,4,B00B5DWH5W,"The main male character was kind of weird and hyper happy. Although he didn't show a range of emotion as changes were going on around him, at the end of the day he came through.  Who was that woman he rekindled a romance with? Most beautiful. And Jamie the girl from Soprano's was funny in a shrewd way and easy on the eyes.",1372377600,,324,4.142857142857143
5559376,4,B00B5DWH5W,We definatly enjoyed this movie but I was expecting/ hoping for a totally different ending... I think I will buy this once it comes out,1369526400,,135,4.44
5559377,4,B00B5DWH5W,"DIVORCE INVITATION is a wacky romantic comedy with some fun set pieces and laughs.  The movie features a solid cast with Jamie Lynn Sigler (SOPRANOS), Jonathan Bennett (MEAN GIRLS), Nadia Bjorlin (DAYS OF OUR LIVES), Andrea Bowen (DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES), Elliott Gould (OCEANS 11) , Lainie Kazan (MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING), Keith Robinson (DREAMGIRLS), Richard Kind (ARGO) and Paul Sorvino (GOODFELLAS).  Check it out for rent now while it's still in theaters!",1368489600,,459,5.361111111111111
5559378,5,B00B5DWH5W,"Great romantic comedy... The ending was not what I expected, but loved how it turned out!  I definitely would recommend this movie!",1368144000,2,131,4.954545454545454
5559379,4,B00B5DWH5W,"Divorce Invitation is a good twist on the dilemma in this romantic comedy.  The set up is that Mike (Jonathan Bennett) marries Dylan (Jamie-Lynn Sigler) and life is good...that is until he runs into the girl (Nadia Bjorlin) who broke his heart in high school.  Having never really gotten over her he's convinced that she is his true soul mate.  The only problem is that he's married and in his pre-nup he must throw a Divorce party for all the guests who attended his wedding in order to be let out of his marriage.  The cast includes: Jonathan Bennett, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Nadia Bjorlin, Elliott Gould, Lainie Kazan and Paul Sorvino.",1368144000,7,633,4.7272727272727275
8562887,5,B00B5DWH5W,"Get married, sign a prenup, meet an old flame, want a divorce. It's not that easy. It shows true love. She only has him sign the prenup because she doesn't believe in divorce and made it iron-clad, or so she thought, to not be able to get divorced. Without spoiling it, just watch. I recommend the film! I added it to my collection as soon as I saw it on Netflix.",1484524800,,363,4.126760563380282
8562888,3,B00B5DWH5W,"This was a pretty good movie over all but with a few ""shortcomings"" here and there. While it is a comedy, most of the humor comes from crude language and comments -- very juvenile to me. The three lead actors, Jonathan Bennett, Jamie Lynn Sigler and Nadia Bjorlin, did their best with the material they had to work with. Jonathan Bennett is a stereotypical ""immature male, ""Mike,"" finding himself simultaneously in love with two women: one his newlywed wife ""Dylan"" (Sigler) and the other his long-lost high school sweetheart, ""Alex"" (Bjorlin).
Jamie Lynn Sigler does a fine job as the young Jewish girl who has just married the love of her life who himself converted to Judaism to prove his love to her and to her family. Four months into their marriage, enter ""Alex"" (Bjorlin),  Mike's love from high school whom he considers his true soul mate.
Jonathan Bennett is charming as the doofus who finds himself in this impossible situation and he plays ""Mike"" with just the right amount of goofy immaturity and silly scheming. The stunning Nadia Bjorlin is the best of the three, in my opinion. Her role as ""the other woman"" is not at all cheesy and ""Alex"" is not a conniving witch bound to break up ""Mike"" and ""Dylan,"" not at all. ""Alex"" is beautiful, rich and successful but she is also a genuine person with heartaches of her own. She truly loves ""Mike"" but doesn't try to force him to leave his new wife. To me, their scenes together on the golf course and in the pool are the best of the movie. ""Alex"" is played with sensitivity and believability by Nadia Bjorlin, who once again shows her considerable acting abilities. She is far more than a pretty face.
I think this movie might have worked better as a drama considering the serious subject matter. Most of the ""comedy"" is provided by ""Mike"" and his equally silly friends and business partners but there are smaller comedic roles filled by Elliot Gould and Richard Kind.
The comedic theme, and thus the title, involves the prenuptial agreement ""Dylan"" presents to ""Mike"" before their wedding which he signs without reading. After ""Mike"" rekindles his romance with ""Alex,"", he goes to considerable trouble to meet the terms of the ""prenup"" in order to divorce ""Dylan"" so they can be together.""
I do think the whole premise should've been taken seriously because the movie really isn't that funny; however, a dramatic take of the material would've been much more compelling. I believe a thoughtful and sincere consideration of a newlywed man so in love with his new bride that he converted to her religion who is suddenly thrust back together with his first love would have made an excellent movie. The immature attempts at ""humor"" would've been unnecessary.
The bittersweet ending is a revelation of how ""Mike"" has matured during his wild run to fulfill the ""divorce invitation clause."" It is both sweet and touching, yet with a lingering sadness for one of the two women who loses her own opportunity for real love and thus exits brokenhearted but without bitterness.
Watch ""Divorce Invitation"" for the light farce it is but see if you agree with me that it might've been so much better as a drama.
I ranked it three stars because it's an ""okay"" movie, nothing spectacular but not terrible either. Language and some sexual content make it unsuitable for children.",1429142400,,3319,4.7822299651567945
8562889,4,B00B5DWH5W,"Mike Christian(Jonathan Bennett) meets his perfect girl played by Jamie-Lynn Sigler. They become engaged. Mike did not read the prenup. They later married. Mike runs into his high school sweetheart Alex. The sparks flew and he decides he wants a divorce. He later realizes the divorce is not as easy as he originally thought. His wife does not believe in divorce and makes the process of divorcing her harder because she placed a clause that said if he wants to be divorced, he has to get the original amount of people at the wedding and hold a ceremony at the same place.
The movie has a surprising twist in the end, but I do not want to ruin it for you.

The acting in the movie was ok for most of the actors expect for Jonathan Bennett because he seemed like he was overdoing some of his scenes.

The movie is a great movie to see with the family because it is funny and witty.",1402617600,,880,4.327272727272727
8562890,3,B00B5DWH5W,"I gave this 3 stars but it's really 3.5 as I couldn't quite go 4 stars.  My wife and I enjoyed it but I imagine it would have been even better, and probably got more attention, if Topher Grace had played the male lead actor.  Still, a nice little rom-com worth your time.",1398556800,,271,4.09433962264151
8562891,2,B00B5DWH5W,"I chose this move based on a 4 star rating, but why would anyone like this movie?  How did Elliot Gould get involved this this borning show.  Neither woman should have had anything to do with that guy.",1394150400,,201,4.2631578947368425
8562892,3,B00B5DWH5W,"cetainely not a memorable piece of work....  we did enjoy parts of it however, if this were at the movies... i would have walked out.  fastforwarding works great in this case",1389916800,,174,4.580645161290323
8562893,1,B00B5DWH5W,"This is a horrible movie. The acting is terrible, the writing impossibly trite. It gives the impression of being written in a different language and then translated by non-native speaker isn't English. It's trying to be a romantic comedy but has puritanical, semi-rauncy sex scenes, foul language, weird obsession with a helicopter rental that the producers decided must be shown as much as possible, tacky sets that are supposed to be elegant and last but not lease the great Elliot Gould being terrible underutilized. The leading man and woman are good actors, but they have such nonsense to spout that they look silly.

Skip it.",1388534400,4,631,5.0095238095238095
8562894,2,B00B5DWH5W,Story line & characters not believable - 2 main character acting seemed very amateur.  Do not recommend if you're looking to be entertained.,1379980800,2,140,5.086956521739131
8562895,5,B00B5DWH5W,"You can't beat watching a movie from Redbox for $1.27 and complain too much. The movie was funny, the acting amateurish, but overall the story held up well.",1379721600,,156,4.607142857142857
8562896,5,B00B5DWH5W,Been waiting for this movie to come out for a while. Nadia Bjorlin is amazing and I'm not just saying it because she's a friend. She rocked this movie and the movie was pretty darn good. :),1375315200,,189,4.135135135135135
