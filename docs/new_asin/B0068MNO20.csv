4978927,1,B0068MNO20,"I got this at the same time as Tracey Mallett's FuseDance Cardio Melt. I sent this one back. Not only did it not raise my heart rate, but only one of the three instructors even looks like a woman! The main instructor looks like Godzilla leading a waltz! I would not spend money on this! I am going to use the money I get back for another Tracey Mallett DVD.",1337644800,2,357,4.114285714285714
4978928,5,B0068MNO20,I have been hesitating to get this dvd for a while now. I finally bought it today and i was very impressed. This is most fun dance workout ever. My and my BF had so much fun dancing and sweating. It really works the ab area and all the moves are fun. I will highly recommend.,1337385600,7,275,3.9285714285714284
4978929,5,B0068MNO20,I absolutely love this...it is so much fun and you really feel the burn! I've used it a few times and really feel like i'm getting the hang of it,1334188800,6,145,3.8666666666666667
4978950,4,B0068MNO20,"I really enjoyed the dancing in this workout. It was a little tricky for me at first, but once I caught on I really enjoyed it. My heart rate went through the roof. I may not feel like you're working out that hard, but you are. I really enjoyed the Latin cardio routines. Very different choreography from the other Firm workout videos that I have done for years. I still love all of the Firm workouts that I have. Cardio Dance is a new favorite in my collection.",1459987200,,462,4.261363636363637

4978952,5,B0068MNO20,the firm rocks! you really see results after 10 work out have lost the weight of my two pregnancies with these workouts and i am still using and buying them!! after my pregnancies was overweight and lost over 80lbs in a short period of time with a healthy diet and you can also shed a lot and i mean a lot without diet as well... but don't go eating like crazy.. ;),1420675200,,365,4.083333333333333
4978953,3,B0068MNO20,Not one of my favorites. Jen looks stiff and the moves did not flow well to me.,1419897600,,79,3.7058823529411766
4978954,5,B0068MNO20,"I have enjoyed this video!  It's not so hard to follow and the moves are easy, I am NOT a dancer in anyway and enjoy this dvd.  I feel really good afterward.  It's a good dvd if you are just starting out.",1419811200,,204,3.8095238095238093
4978955,5,B0068MNO20,"I am not much of a dancer, but have been having a lot of fun learning with different videos.  I like that this is broken into 3 segments, 20 minutes each.  I tell myself that I only have to do 20 minutes and end up doing the whole thing because I am having fun.  I also like the way each segment builds to a final routine, so you feel like you know what you are doing by the end of it.",1415404800,,385,3.728395061728395
4978956,4,B0068MNO20,"This DVD was exactly what I was looking for. There are three cardio dance workouts, each twenty minute segments. They all make me break a sweat and are challenging enough, but simple enough to learn. Great for days when you want a quick workout or you combine two or more of them for longer time.",1412812800,,296,4.4
4978957,4,B0068MNO20,"This is a fun workout - it's not my favorite, but I like to throw it in the mix to keep things interesting. The reggae one is hard for me to do b/c it's pretty slow, though.",1405036800,,173,3.7027027027027026

4978959,2,B0068MNO20,"I was a little disappointed, I thought it was a zumba tape. I have to say I still have not watched the whole tape.  So it might get better.",1396828800,,139,3.793103448275862
4978970,4,B0068MNO20,"I enjoyed all of the dances and worked up a sweat doing them. I have several Firm videos, and I like a lot of the instructors, but
the one on this tape, Jennifer, does not show much enthusiasm or personality. If Allie had been the instructor, I would have given it five stars.",1376179200,,276,4.226415094339623
4978971,3,B0068MNO20,"i didn't enjoy this dvd as much as i did the best of the firm club dance. the club dance is a longer workout and at a faster pace. this dvd has one fast paced workout and 2 slow routines eanch for 20 min each. the routines are fun to learn, but i thought i would do more of a stronger workout. what i really don't like about this dvd is the fact that it is a 20 min workout, so you have to learn how to do the routines as they are doing it; like you're just supposed to know all the steps. once you practice a few times, you should have it down pat, but i don't like that they don't give you the time to learn",1375142400,,609,3.7286821705426356
4978972,4,B0068MNO20,Been a Firm Believer for 23 years so always trust the quality of their workouts.  This is not my favorite but it is a decent workout with good music and queuing.,1374364800,,161,4.193548387096774
4978973,5,B0068MNO20,She cues well and the routines are fun and high energy.  I would recommend this workout to Firm fans.  I do like it.,1372550400,,116,4.0
4978974,5,B0068MNO20,"The workouts on this DVD are only 20min long and not that difficult. They are not the most challenging, but I love having them in rotation for days I don't want to do anything that makes me sweaty and exhausted, but makes me glad I moved my body for a short time. If you are not great at dancing, don't worry and let it get in the way. It's fun to learn the moves and it's ok if you're not perfect, you can learn them fairly fast.  It's also great they include a website link to a bonus workout.",1360713600,,495,4.0
4978975,5,B0068MNO20,I was a little unsure at first with all the dance moves but this really does work up a good sweat and is lots of fun too.  I received my order fast and was very happy with the condition.  Works perfectly. Thanks.,1353974400,,212,4.023809523809524
4978976,4,B0068MNO20,"About myself:  I am a high intermediate DVD workout junkie.  :-)  I do anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half of both cardio and strength 3 times per week. If I'm not burning and covered in sweat, then it's not a good workout and I'm wasting my time!  :-)

Now that being said, none of these three 20 minute dance workouts would be enough on its own for myself or anyone who works out like I do.

As I've said, this DVD is composed of three 20-minute dance workouts, each one reflecting a different dance style:  Club Dance, Caribbean and Latin.  Warming up and cooling down are included in the 20-minute workouts.

Club Dance is the most aerobically challenging, in my opinion.  It is the fastest-paced and highest impact of them all, with lots of hopping and deep bending, so your legs will burn and your heart rate will climb faster.

Caribbean Dance is a little slower, a little lower impact.  It has a lot of twisting, Afro-Latin/Caribbean moves. Though the moves are lower impact, they're fast-paced enough for a good sweat to kick in about halfway through the workout.  By the end of the workout, I'm pretty sweaty.

The slowest and least aerobically challenging is the Latin Dance.  There is absolutely no impact, and you go through traditional mambos, cross steps, back steps, waist twists, etc.  Though I find this fun, it takes me a while to get a good sweat going during this one, even throwing myself into the moves with energy and some exageration.  It seems as though I am just starting to get good and sweaty when it's time for the cool down.

I think these workouts are fun and effective, but unless you're an absolute beginner, you'll want more.  If this is the case, you can do one of two things:
1. Do all three workouts together for an hour of dance cardio, or 2. Do what I do and use just one 20-minute workout as a cardio add-on to other workouts. I like to do one of these workouts and then follow it with strength training.  THEN I feel like I've had a great workout!  :-)

Love The Firm!  Love dance!  I would definitely recommend this workout!",1347235200,22,2075,4.457446808510638
4978977,4,B0068MNO20,I see mixed reviews on this video but I didn't think it was too bad. The positive things about this video is it's very crisp and clear (doesn't look like it was made in the 90s but looks like its HD). It's just an empty dance room with 3 instructors (but only one talks through out the video) so it kind of makes me feel like I'm at an exercise class in the gym :). I thought the moves kind of reminded me of Zumba :) or Shabam. I haven't completed the full video but I think it's a pretty nice.,1346803200,,495,3.910891089108911
4978978,1,B0068MNO20,"Like another reviewer said, the first workout was tolerable and did get your heart rate up...a little bit.  But the other two were a waste of time.  I'm surprised the FIRM let this pass.  I have many FIRM dvds and am usually happy with most of their products, but this one was boring, unimaginative, and slow.  Try another dvd first.  This is not the best the FIRM has to offer.",1342569600,,378,4.3428571428571425
4978979,2,B0068MNO20,"The first dance is okay, the others didn't do much to get my heart rate up at all. I have only done this dvd once and Im just not happy with it. The dances are short and not at all heart pumping work outs, maybe for a beginner they would be ok. I am 48 years old and I did not feel like I got a work out even doing the entire dvd. I have several of The Firm dvd's that I like very much but I would not recommend this one.",1338681600,7,421,3.5869565217391304

8494876,4,B0068MNO20,"I wanted to add this to my walking workouts, and it really has been worth the price.  I have arthritic knees and have missed doing the firm workouts; it was like letting a good friend go after many years.  I still own all the vhs originals.  This was great because there is a moderator that takes all the jumps and squats out, allowing me to follow along at a slower, safer, pace for me.  The movements are fast though, and there is some choreography to learn.  I like that because it's something to focus on besides the clock.  It's not a workout for a triathlete but that's fine with me.",1486857600,2,589,4.3090909090909095
8494877,4,B0068MNO20,"I like it. It's a more fun way to exercise. I like that they have three different dance styles. Unfortunately, the second and the third style are almost the same.",1480982400,,162,4.433333333333334

8494882,3,B0068MNO20,"This is not my favourite dance workout DVD. There are 3 20-minute workouts --- club dance, salsa sizzle and carribean groove. Club dance really got me sweating, which I loved. The other 2 workouts, not so much. So that was disappointing. All the dance routines are fun, though. The most annoying thing is that each workout had a warm up and cool down. It would have been nice if the producers had seperated out these two things so you can spend a full 20, 40 or 60 minutes dancing if you want. Still, I do like this DVD and will probably do it when I want a lighter workout.",1460246400,2,574,4.275229357798165
