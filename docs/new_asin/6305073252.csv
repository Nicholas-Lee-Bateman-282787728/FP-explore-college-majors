8277767,5,6305073252,"I had ordered this DVD, and-- while it was probably delivered to the address that I specified-- I never got it.
I tried to get another DVD (from someone else) at that same address, and I never got that one either, but I think I now know what's been happening-- someone at that address with a last name eerily similar to mine has been stealing them. I mentioned to Amazon and to the seller that I never got Sorority Girls, but I think they secretly never believed me. (And I keep getting notices from Amazon to rate it!) So, everybody, I'm sure it is a very wonderful DVD, and one of these days I might try to order it again.",1270598400,,624,4.208333333333333
8277768,4,6305073252,"Dont get me wrong I love fresh naked woman dancing around. But I would prefer a little more action. The whole time watching it I was just waiting for something to happen, sometimes got half and half bored. These girls are  hot, there naked and they are together. But they don't actually do anything  together.  If you are going to have a two girl scene at least let them  excite each other. Or even if they are alone let them comfort themselves.  This is the main thing lacking in this movie and it exactly what the people  that buy these movies are looking for. They don't actually play with what we  want them to and I have found this the same with other Penthouse and  Playboy films",964742400,,685,4.338582677165355
