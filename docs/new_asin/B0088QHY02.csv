8572348,5,B0088QHY02,"A great capstone film to an even greater television show, ""Moteki"" suffers only insofar as there is no purchasable version of the TV series with subtitles... mind you, you can find it subtitled online, but either way, watch the show first before you see the film. As to the film itself, great acting -- at turns hilarious and believably brutal -- great music (with plenty of cameos from Japan's music scene), and the ending you wanted from the TV show. In a way reminiscent of the British TV series ""Spaced,"" Moteki is my single favorite piece of entertainment to come out of Japan in twenty years.",1381190400,2,598,4.650943396226415
