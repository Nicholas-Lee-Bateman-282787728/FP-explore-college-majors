3556933,5,B001EPKKV4,"John the XXIII is a welcome and serious addition to my growing collection of religious movies. The movie is extremely well made and the directors have taken the necessary pains in making it authentic by including real historical clips from the era. Ed Asner as the Good Pope John, bears an uncanny resemblance to the late Pontiff and executes his role with brilliance.
The movvie begins at the death of Pius XII. In Venice the necessary preparations are being made for Cardinal Roncalli to attend the conclave. From here we begin a series of flashbacks to the Cardinals childhood in his impoverished town, to his days as a young priest, where he works in different difficult situations in various countries. From there we move on to the happenings of the conclave and his days as Pope.
What I have understood is that Pope John XXIII had the best interests of both the Church and the world at heart. That caused him to convene the 2nd Vatican council (something I have long blamed the good Pope for). However after watching tis movie, whatever apprehensions I have had about Papa Roncalli has disappeared. Had he lived longer, I believe he would have stopped 75% of the errors of interpretation that we good catholics have long suffered.
In short this movie is filled with wit, humour, piety, heroism and simplicity....all the hall marks of Blessed John XXIII.",1228348800,14,1359,4.811965811965812

It clearly demonstrates the opposition of many self-serving clerics in the Vatican and how John dealt with them.  While I had a great appreciation of John XXIII while he was pope, I have a greater appreciation now, having seen some of the political bantering that he had to deal with to pull off the Vatican II Council, etc.  You will not be disappointed if you enjoy Church History.",1419638400,,499,4.636363636363637
3556940,5,B001EPKKV4,"Pope John XXIII:The Pope Of Peace is an inspiring feature film on Blessed Pope John XXIII. It stars Edward Asner in an acclaimed performance as the beloved pontiff. Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli,known as John XXIII during his papacy from 1958-1963,came from common stock and was known for his simplicity, goodness, courage and love for humanity. He called the Second Vatican Council (19621965) but did not live to see it to completion. He died in 1963, only four-and-a-half years after his election. He was beatified, along with Pope Pius IX, on 3 September 2000.

Pope John XXIII:The Pope Of Peace tells a story of Roncalli during his election to the papacy in parallel to his life from the early days of childhood to the days as a Catholic priest. Aside from being a biopic TV movie,it also narrates how he outdid himself and of expectations during his years in the Pontificate. Elected supposedly as an interim Pope that would just keep the status quo and listen to the advisers around him,he proved to be his own man when he surprised the Church and world by calling for the Second Vatican Council. This film also underscores his personality like his wonderful sense of humor and great charity towards others, especially the poor, downtrodden, and the outcast.

Pope John XXIII:The Pope Of Peace is an outstanding TV biopic movie about the pope that tells the blessed life story of John XXIII from his youth through his young priesthood, Bishop, Cardinal and Pope. It consists of excellent acting from the cast especially Asner as Roncalli,whom I believe have given a one great performance of a lifetime. The story was interesting from beginning to end. Added to that, it has a beautiful cinematography as the film was shot on location in Rome and exotic locations in Italy.

Overall,Pope John XXIII:The Pope Of Peace is one excellent story not only for Catholics but also for people who want to admire and emulate outstanding people who made great contributions to the history of the world and mankind.",1417737600,,2002,4.899705014749262

3556943,3,B001EPKKV4,"This is probably a good motion picture ""documentary"" of the outward life of this beloved pope.  But, apart from his humility, it reveals almost nothing of his spirituality.

3556944,5,B001EPKKV4,"Since I've studied in Rome and have read some of the actual accounts in italian from those who were  lived during the tumultous times of Vatican II, I was kind of skeptical but curious to see how this movie about John XXII: Pope of Peace would ring true! ..

I am happy to say that this film is great and more authentic than I expected...It depicts so well the human journey of a ""simple"" italian priest who left Sotto de Monte,Italy to rise to the Chair of St. Peter! The wit and personality life of St. Pope John XIII shone through in the incredible performance by Ed Asner! Only he could embrace the real humanity and heart of the saint  who was ""Angelo Roncalli"".

The movie John XXIII, Pope of Peace is a mini-series by RAI  about 8 hours in length...but it is really worth your time to watch. It also follows the history of the world during the time of the Cold war; and studies the intrigue and political jockeying that occurs behind the scenes during the Papal elections. And It is in English, too! No subtitles!!!

For those who want to see how a Papal election actually happens, watch this film! Some the scenes are filmed at the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City where the Papal elections happen every time!!!  John XXIII: Pope of Peace gets 5 Stars and MOLTO, MOLTO BENE from Me...I am so glad that I saw it...Check it out! Ciao!",1405728000,,1338,4.414634146341464

He plays the part beautifully. This movie takes you inside the voting area. Whether the crew was allowed in the Cistine chapel I doubt, but the set they made looked real. They followed protocol very well.
Also, you see the very human side of Pope John XXIII. He was a lovely
""grandfather"" type pope. He is responsible for starting Vatican I.

3556954,5,B001EPKKV4,Excellent movie and rendition of the pope by Ed Asner.  This pope was considered to be temporary and instead began the second Vatican Council.,1388534400,,142,4.916666666666667
3556955,5,B001EPKKV4,"Going into this film I had already seen several of these Italian-international papal biography miniseries epics: ""Pius XII: Under the Roman Sky,"" ""Paul VI: The Pope in the Tempest,"" ""John Paul I: The Smile of God,"" and ""Pope John Paul II."" So you might say I had ""pope movie fatigue."" One of these films (""Pope John Paul II"" with Jon Voight, produced after his death for CBS television at Christmas 2005) is Emmy-nominated and brilliant. The others are mixed bags, sometimes stirring and often hokey, featuring subtitled or badly dubbed Italian actors in heavily fictionalized portrayals of the titular popes turning them into boring plaster saints. All are richly produced. So when I turned on ""John XXIII: The Pope of Peace"" with Ed Asner, I did not have high expectations, and the poor English dubbing of the first actors who appear in the film is somewhat distracting. But I was shocked to find myself increasingly involved with and entertained by this 3-hour miniseries as it went along. That's because it features a poignant and sensitive lead performance by (Jewish) actor Ed Asner as the titular pope, avoiding most pitfalls of the genre like pseudo-mystical foreshadowing and dumb fictionalized subplots of pope-worship.

The movie begins with the 1958 death of Pius XII and Cardinal Angelo Roncalli, patriarch of Venice, traveling to Rome for the conclave that will elect him pope under the name of John XXIII. Rather than giving us an extended and possibly dull flashback to Roncalli's youth, we get a series of short flashbacks as Roncalli and other characters recall his background at the conclave. These swift flashback scenes, despite bad English dubbing that includes the young actor playing Roncalli, do a great job showing the future pope's character and impoverished background without lingering over unnecessary subplots like most of the films in this genre. In fact, this entire movie (including the second half centering on Roncalli's five-year papacy culminating in the Second Vatican Council) is delightfully free of the stupid fictional characters and ""prophecy"" scenes that litter the other RAI-Lux Vide papal films in this genre. Even better, Asner is a revelation as John XXIII, nailing the pope's humility and common touch as the ""people's pope"" in a satisfying way. Despite speaking in a plain American accent, rather than attempting an Italian patois ala Jon Voight's Polish accent in ""Pope John Paul II,"" Asner overcomes the minor distraction of his voice through spot-on mannerisms and acting touches that make it feel like he is really John XXIII.

Fortunately, the DVD also includes an Italian language track (with English subtitles) that is far superior to the English language track, allowing one to hear all of the actors (except Asner, who is dubbed) in their original voices rather than in the distracting English dubbing. Ironically, it appears that only Asner was speaking English during filming, as all of the other actors are Europeans whose lips and voices decisively match the Italian track. So the English track features only Asner in his own voice, while the Italian track features all of the players except him in their own voices, but the Italian dubbing of Asner masterfully matches his lip movements and is far less distracting than the English track. This choice between tracks is an odd one to have on a DVD, but is much appreciated over a disc that would only give us the poor English dubbing.

In any event, as a film produced before Pope Francis decided to canonize John XXIII along with John Paul II as saints in spring 2014, this movie is particularly topical for Catholics today. I have not seen ""The Good Pope"" with Bob Hoskins as John XXIII, mainly because it is not available on DVD in the United States, but this film is pretty good as a straightforward biography of the 20th century pope who had the biggest impact in the shortest time. As the title suggests, it emphasizes his focus on peace (remember the encyclical Pacem in Terris?) as the greatest remedy to the world's woes in a war-torn century that was the most destructive in human history, but it also covers Vatican II in a satisfying way. Although the second half becomes a bit talky as it focuses on the papacy and forgets the flashbacks, there is a compelling dramatic tension between Cardinal Ottaviani (the Holy Office head who opposed calling Vatican II) and John XXIII whom he is attempting to manipulate as a ""transitional pope,"" providing some good emotional payoffs. This miniseries really gives you a strong sense of the man who, together with John Paul II, is currently one of just 2 popes in the 20th century to be be declared saint.",1387929600,6,4671,4.970588235294118

Although I was not born when Angelo Roncilli was pope I got a sense of his humility that I was told about by a fellow professor.

3556961,4,B001EPKKV4,"The one word that comes to mind about the movie, John XXIII is joy.  The pope's joy made him happy and humorous.  The film captures this beautifully mainly because of Ed Asner's portrayal of the famous pope.  He does a fine job and conveys his reluctant beginnings that changes to acceptance of his role as the vicar of Christ.  The movie is a fine production and conveys the journey of this unlikely pope who spread his love for his faith and people.  The self-proclaimed 'simple and poor country priest' leads his world flock with joy and hope.  This movie will make you smile and hope.

I recommend you watch it in Italian to get the full experience.",1365292800,,653,4.52991452991453

John XXIII was a humble priest, not an emperor, and became a real pupil of his way, by his desire for peace! It was this desire which guided him to His will. Edward Asner shows on a magnificent manner, the life of Angelo Joseph Roncalli and the example of the good pope. Goodness is not a gift neither it is a choice. Goodness is a consequence. It is the salary for the hard work in the heart.

How he was guided by God as God continued opening the doors for him. I love watching these kind of movies as it shows the love the priests, bishops, and Popes had towards humanity , and also the way they risked their lives hiding jewish people on convents, mnasteries where ever they could just to save them from being killed by the germans.

He shows John to have been that incredible being whom Hannah Arendt celebrated in her book ""Men in Dark Times"":  a real Christian. It was as a real Christian that John won the hearts of millions of people throughout the world, and not Catholics alone.

Not meaning to denigrate Mr. Asner's considerable acting ability, I was nonetheless skeptical that ""Lou Grant"" could pull it off. Was I pleasantly surprised. Although he is the only actor actually speaking English (the other dialog is voiced-over) the film flowed very well. Growing up in the  Giovanni XXIII era, I was happily reminded of those ""heady days"" when nothing good seemed impossible. With due deference to many of his predecessors, and much deference to his successor JPII, XXIII was indeed the ""peoples' pope"". And salud, Mr. Asner, for capturing the essence of this great man!

3556973,5,B001EPKKV4,"Pope John XXIII, as all biographers tell, never wanted anything for himself. He only wanted to serve the God through His Church. And always saw himself living and dying as a priest. But God knows His children, and had other plans for him. And this is all true, and all told in this movie.

Ed Asner gives the best acting of his life, and one of the best acting ever. He is just superb as John XXIII. And the other members of the cast are amazing too. French actor Claude Rich is particularly great as Cardinal Ottaviani. Even if the Cardinal's actions are greatly exaggerated to make a classic movie antagonist.

There are many poetic licenses in this movie (actually a mini-series made for Italian TV), but they don't stain the Pope's history. It's very much like all his biographers wrote, and as he described himself in his ""Journal Of A Soul"".

A very moving picture. The fantastic soundtrack helps a lot. Give it a try, and you'll see what a fantastic movie, about a great saint.",1302912000,3,984,4.548022598870056
3556974,2,B001EPKKV4,"First off, John XXIII of Blessed memory, was one of the great men of our time. Period. His love and warmth and identification as Father, a Good Father to all, was unmistakable. For years in Rome, long after the slow decline of what he had prayed for, cab drivers in and around the vatican, and in some of Romas less, shall we say, desirable areas, had post card photos of JOHN XXIII above the visor in their cars. Non Catholics loved him,most everyone except the Neanderthal Right loved him. Now to this film. Ed Asner is superb as Papa Roncalli. The production is pretty good[im guessing italian Tv was the producer?}It is with the tone that I find objectionable. Somehow, the reforms of Vatican II  many which have never seen the light of day, were excesses brought on after John passed away?  The  2 'experts' who are brought on afterwards, Hitchcock and Fr Pacwa are reminiscent of the talking heads on Fox news who redefine what Reagan Bush et al did and make it palatable[well, to them,anyway].

Asner adroitly portrays this humble, visionary reformer before & during his years as Pope of the Catholic Church. While not an award-winning production, the quality is in Asner's performance and in the life-story of Angelo Roncalli (his given name). The pace is deliberate, as are many foreign productions of this nature, but it will keep the interest of fans of this genre. The mostly Italian cast renders solid performances too.
