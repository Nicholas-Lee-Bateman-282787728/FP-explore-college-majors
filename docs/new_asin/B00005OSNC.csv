8324357,5,B00005OSNC,"Mommy and Me was a great series-- until they sold to (I think)Disney. And, believe me, I'm the biggest Disney fan out there, but this time, they ruined something wonderful.

Anyways, Lullaby and Goodnight, Splish Splash, and Fun and Friends are the first three.  After that, they changed formats and casting methods and all of the series took place in an ugly daycare type room.  But, these three dvds I've just mentioned are before those drastic changes and they are phenomenal.

My daughter's favorites, in order (and my husband's and mine, too) are Lullaby and Goodnight, then Splish Splash, then Fun and Friends.  But, they are all wonderful.

Each episode takes place in a warm and cheerfully decorated home.  Lullaby and Goodnight is a slumber party, where several moms and their kids of different ages are having a sleepover.  They sing songs, brush their teeth and wash their faces and get their pajamas on.  Then they hear a story and go to sleep.  They also have a talking radio, voiced by Tim Conway (who's very likable here) and a talking silly flower voiced by Caroline Rhea.  She's good, too, but they weren't necessary because the stars of the shows are the moms.

They aren't glamorous, but they are all attractive mothers with very nice personalities and voices.  They take turns singing and speaking and do a wonderful job.  They are very professional, but seem like moms rather than actors.  Each episode has a mom that is in the spotlight more than the others, but they all take their turns.  Lullaby and Goodnight's mom  is on the front cover and she has an adorable personality-- very likable, very sweet and engaging.

Splish Splash's episode is about water play-- the stories involve water, the songs involve water and the kids play outside in the backyard pool.  The main mom here is also sweet and very upbeat-- you have to smile while watching any of these dvds.

Fun and Friends' theme is friends (as are all the others, too), and is also charming and great fun.

When my daughter watched these, she wanted to play them CONTINUALLY.  She learned how to press play on the dvd player while watching these.  Even now that she's four, she'll request one or two of them sometimes.

They are great fun and I really wish they would have made more of these dvds.  The quality is wonderful and each dvd has some extras including parental advice, etc.  Kind of boring run of the mill stuff, but I bought the dvds for the kids, not for the advice, so I'm very happy with them.",1199836800,,2493,4.660550458715596
