8298424,4,B001EJXRWE,"Best value available. This is a Great top notch program with a plethora of individual new moves to add and combine with other moves that you have seen in a different sequence or know. I must be fully honest. After this introduction to multiple combinations of moves you will have to add, mix, and match them including with other moves that you know and have learned to find and create your own continuity with your new inventory of moves to add your own touch of style, flavor. and grace to bring with you unto the dance floor. These discs and instructions were wonderfully presented clear and concise without dragging on too long to a bore. You can see how the program disc developed from experience. All of the disc always give great and valuable insight on etiquette of the dance floor. You will not catch them right away if at all, but after multiple practices with a keen eye you can notice that Jesus always messes up on all of the dvds that I have seen him instructing as wonderful as he really is, and Jesus dance teaching style movements are always faster than actually dancing to the real rhythm and melody of the songs music in harmony when it comes to really leading ladies especially unknowing of the patterns on the dance floor. I could really tell later after I would take it unto the dance floor without having really focused on really listening and practicing paced in harmony to the music while dancing. Both of those will let you know that you are becoming a really good dancer. That is all of my best advice. Bring a presence of your own personality style unto the dance floor, make it enjoyable, make it hot, and keep it sexy and always classy. Enjoy it up because this is good quality! :)",1445904000,,1710,4.501607717041801

8298426,5,B001EJXRWE,"These salsa lessons are very well demonstrated and explained.  I tried these out based on the other reviews on Amazon, which were very good, and I really like this series!  I highly recommend the Salsa Crazy DVD's.",1428969600,,214,4.756756756756757
8298427,5,B001EJXRWE,I've several Salsa learning DVD but the teaching from Salsa Crazy are the best from Beginner Intermediate to Advance. Steps that you can use on dance floor and shine are break down and simplified so one can learn them. Look for picture of couple dance logo when you buy since there are DVD that name close to it. I'm very happy to find these SalsaCrazy learning DVD and no more watch others Salsa teaching anymore.,1426550400,,414,4.533333333333333

8298429,5,B001EJXRWE,"An excellent resource for turn patterns. 5 of the 6 DVDs are taught On 1, the last one is On 2 , but that should not be a problem for intermediate dancers. Well taught and explained. DVDs 1 & 2 had more material on ladies styling than the others. In this regard, my favorite were DVDs 1, 2 and 6.",1420502400,2,296,3.95
