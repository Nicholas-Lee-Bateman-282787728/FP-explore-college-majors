413755,5,6301971752,Im 13 years old i love motel hell it is funny! Roy and Nancy Parsons are good in the role of the farmer and his sister ida! the movie is about the farmer and his sister but traps in the road and when people reck! they bury  them in the ground and then dig them up and eat them! in the smoked meats!  then wolfman jack makes a apperence!!!! it is funny!,929232000,6,352,3.875
413756,5,6301971752,"Veteran actor Rory Calhoun stars as the delightfully fiendish Farmer Vincent in a deliciously ghoulish tale of the macabre that has now become a cult classic. ""Meat is meat, and a man's gotta eat!"" That was  always granny's philosophy. And that's the way folks still think over at  the Motel Hello (the o is burnt out on the sign) where Farmer Vincent mixes  up his special blend of smoked meats. Heck, everybody in the county just  loves Farmer Vincent's sausages and hams there's nothing quite like 'em.  But pray tell , what's that we've heard about strangers just passing by  Vincent's motel? And what are those odd things planted in vincent's  ""secret garden"" that he only tends to at night? And, gosh, what  are those strange carcasses Vincent has hangin' in the smokehouse? The  Motel Hello is open for business folks. But if you're asked to stay for  dinner, you may want to think twice!! Go rent motel hell at your local  video store and just sit back and watch trust me you will be happy you  did!!",917049600,31,1008,4.601123595505618
413797,4,6301971752,"How can you describe ""Motel Hell""?If this movie happened in real life it would be HORRIBLE but in the fantasy world of a movie it is so horrible that it is somewhat funny. SPOILER ALERT,Don't you think since POOR BOB went missing from a government job people would be searching for him?When the 2 little daughters run to the car screaming and crying don't you think their parents would want to know what scared them?I was disappointed that Nina Axelrod and or Elaine Joyce were not interviewed on the extras. Like my review of ""The Toolbox Murders""1978,do not take this movie seriously. Farmer Vincent justifies himself by saying too many people,not enough food,but I say THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO WASTE FOOD.",1499212800,,735,4.7952755905511815

413849,5,6301971752,"A surprisingly well done cinematic gem that attains cult classic excellence; including, macabre humor and morbidly ghoulish thematic content within the horror genre. Moreover, the film intertwines more serious elements, within the story line, that is a clever indictment of American society's self destructive forays into crass consumerism and consumption. Especially, involving overall American dietary habits; therefore, the film seems to beg the rhetorical question, ""Any body listening at McDonald's?"" Also, actor Rory Calhoun is in rare form during the twilight of his career and turns in a bravura tour  de force performance.  Essentially, Rory Calhoun had previously been regarded as an actor of marginal talent earlier in his career; whose, primary appeal was his good looks and physique. However, later in his career, including movies like Motel Hell, actor Rory Calhoun proved that he had eventually learned to be an exceptional dramatic and camp comedic actor.  Thereby, characterizing his later acting performances with a wry twist and tongue in cheek twinkle in his eye.. For example, Farmer Vincent, as portrayed by actor Rory Calhoun, made the dying declaration confession that he was a fraud; because, he had used preservatives in his secret recipe smoked meats. Moreover, the films signature tag line was delivered by actor Rory Calhoun with a macabrely humorous panache; thereby, providing  the perfect down beat ending. Although, the signature tagline was underscored by the unmentioned ironic subtext;' when, the Farmer Vincent character seemed non plused that the secret recipe for his smoked meats included harvested human remains from his ""flesh garden"" mixed with pork. Come to think of it, ""I don't think I'll ever eat another hot dog again."" Who knows what's in there! My compliments to Farmer Vincent for motivating me to improve my dietary habits and be more cautious about the ingredients in the products that I buy!",1474588800,4,1945,5.3881578947368425

Along w/ their motel business, the Vincent's also run a regionally-famous, sausage-making operation. Delicious and nutritious, Farmer Vincent's meats are a tasty treat! Of course, the secret ingredient has something to do w/ many missing guests, and / or innocent passers-by in the area, but why go into all that? Nope, Farmer Vincent and Ida, though a tad on the religious side, are wonderful hosts. Enter young Terry (Nina Axelrod), a survivor of the latest motorcycle accident to occur nearby. The Smith's are more than happy to nurse the poor girl back to health, while Terry ponders the alleged death -and rather hasty burial- of her unfortunate boyfriend. But mmmm-mmmm, don't those sausages taste good?! Romance, terror, and violence soon bloom, as MOTEL HELL kicks into high gear! Dark, macabre, and ultimately hilarious, this movie must be seen for the final chainsaw duel alone, if for no other reason! Highly recommended...  P.S.- Watch for Wolfman Jack as the ultra-smarmy TV preacher, and John Ratzenberger as a bearded member of the doomed rock band, ""Ivan And The Terribles""!...",1443139200,2,1277,5.199029126213592

This is a delightful organic salad of classic American horror tropes. It is clear, especially when you consider the year it was released, that it owes a basically existential debt to Tobe Hooper's groundbreaking Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It at once attempts to up the ante by offering original and perverse atrocities that make this as genuine a piece of torture porn as anything in the Hostel or Saw franchises, and on the other hand significantly lowers the seriousness by adding a level of Don Knots type comedy that still exists in quality horror movies today, e.g. Nathan Fillion in Slither (2006).

I love this movie!

What a gem. It's glorious, and gloriously cheesy all at once.
Vincent and Ida are such an interesting pair of villains. Within their wickedness you can't but help liking them slightly.
Their charming nature is something i haven't seen in many horror films... Vincent's truly convinced he is doing good with his sister.

I normally wouldn't watch a movie like this based its description because cannibalism itself is disgusting and you wouldn't expect this film to be entertaining.

Nothing is too gruesome, their isn't much blood to recall, it's a perfect blend of shock and gore with some really laughable dialouge and not so great acting.
In my opinion, it's 'cannibal holocaust' meets '7th heaven' ...

414311,4,6301971752,"Once again stumbling through the archives of undiscovered horror gems courtesy of Scream Factory, Ive come across 1980s Motel Hell Collectors Edition. Its quite obvious from the films tagline what inspired this darkly humorous tale of one mans quest to serve up the best meat he can to his customers. Tobe Hooper decided to collect some indirect royalties in 1986 by taking the idea of a chainsaw duel for Texas Chainsaw Massacre II.

Farmer Vincent is famous throughout the county for his special blend of smoked meat. People come from miles around just to buy it in bulk. They wouldnt be so thrilled if they only knew what the mysterious ingredients were that he used. With the help of his devoted sister, Vincent would do anything to keep the family recipe a secret.

Motel Hell Collectors Edition is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.85:1) with DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo. The picture quality was satisfying and obviously a step up from its regular DVD release. While its not the 5.1 surround mix diehard fans will want, the 2.0 sound is adequate and amplifies the gurgling of Farmer Vincents victims enough to give you the creeps.

Just like Farmer Vincents vittles, Scream Factorys Motel Hell Collectors Edition is stuffed full of bloody goodness. Director Kevin Connor provides new commentary for the film. It includes new interviews with Connor, Producers / Writers Robert Jaffe and Steven Charles Jaffe, actors Marc Silver, Paul Linke, and Rosanne Katon, and Stunt Co-Ordinator Gene Hartline. The featurette Ida Be Thy Name: A Look Back at Motel Hells Frightful Female Protagonist, Ida Smith celebrates Farmer Vincents insanely dedicated sister. A theatrical trailer is included as well.

Motel Hell is rated R for all the same reasons every horror film from the 1980s holds the certification. Theres plenty of gore splashing around onscreen. Explicit language and nudity are part of the list of ingredients, too. A full-frontal nude scene was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the storyline.

What makes Motel Hell The Collectors Edition such a highly recommended item for me is its entire tone. Its directed as a straight horror film with crazy people doing crazy things, but believing what they're doing to be right and justified. This aspect makes the movie all the more disturbing and keeps your attention by being completely bonkers.

They have so for about 30 years. However, something is bizarre about these 2 and their latest guest Debbie (Monique St. Pierre a 70's Playboy ho) that they take in after a motorbike accident that cost Debbie her boyfriends life, may just be the mistake of the Smith's lives.

For the first few minutes the story is a bit boring, but eventually things do pick up and become a little less cheesy compared to some of the attempts at cheap scares the start of the film had. I think the director by that point gave up on trying to make a horror movie, and just focused on it being somewhat interesting to watch. I think they managed to succeed there. By the end of the film it turned out better than I thought it would be compared to judging what I thought it would be from seeing the opening few minutes of the film.

The films OK for what it is, considering it was only made as a cheap drive-in flick for the early 80's which where a dime a dozen.

414342,2,6301971752,"""Motel Hell"" is quite a difficult film to gauge. It is referred to as a horror-comedy, but that description isn't very accurate, as it is more weird than funny and more macabre than scary.

The story revolves around a couple of hoteliers (played by Rory Calhoun and Nancy Parsons), who have a side business selling fine smoked meats. But what makes the meats so good is the terrifying secret ingredient of human flesh.

I have to say, going into this film, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. With cannibalism being a factor in the film, you might be expecting a lot of gruesome scenes. Yet, surprisingly, there is very little in the way of graphic gore to be found. The story is also a bit odd, in that there are some scenes that seem to drag on, yet give you little in the way of a pay-off. Also, most of the acting is fairly poor. Whether this is due to the lack of skills of the actors, or a case of a script that gives them little to work with, I can't really say. The side drama about the love triangle involving Terry (played by Nina Axelrod) and the brother of the cannibal farmer, who is also the town's Sheriff (played by Paul Linke), is little more than a strained (and sometimes dull) attempt to set up the final conflict between the brothers. Although, the film can boast of being an early work for actor John Ratzenberger (who would go onto heights of television fame on the series ""Cheers""). Unfortunately, he gets very little to do in the film (including not a single piece of dialog) being nothing more than a victim to be killed. Director Kevin Connor never really seems to bring the story to life, until towards the very end. And if you haven't found yourself engaged long before that point, it probably won't much matter to you. The cinematography is fine, but it feels like it would play better on an old drive-in screen, than on your television, which is probably only fitting, as the film was obviously geared for such a venue.

The only things that save this film from the scrap pile, are the last 20 minutes of the film and the solid performance of Rory Calhoun as the cannibalistic farmer. He manages to make you believe both his down-home country manners and his twisted psychotic reasoning in killing people for food. His performance stands high above anyone else in the film. And the final battle at the film's end also brings a spark of life to what, up until this point, has been a very strange and slow-moving tale. When Calhoun's character comes out wearing a pig's head and wielding a chainsaw, it is truly a sight to behold.

As I said at the start, ""Motel Hell"" is a hard film to figure out. It's not really good and looks extremely dated today, but neither is it total crap and completely uninteresting. Die-hard horror buffs might want to check this one out, but I highly doubt many others would have much interest in this cult film. It really is an enigma in the world of horror cinema.",1273017600,7,2925,4.47191011235955
414343,3,6301971752,"This movie is typical of its genre.  In this case a whacked out farmer and his sister are in the sausage business and they add a little extra to their pork-based meat.  They capture motorists passing by or guests to their hotel and plant them in the ground.  Once they've ""cured"" they pull thm up with a tractor and bring them to the smokehouse.  The farmer is smart enough to cut their vocal cords and place gunny sacks over their heads so no one can hear their cries.

Yes it is a dumb plot.  Yes the script is lame, but this movie has a charm (if such a word is applicable).  It has its hero, a bungling sheriff, and its heroine, an attractive blonde.  Eventually Farmer Vincent is figured out and a classic battle of chainsaws ensues.  Why Vincent finds the need to put on a big pig head is not explained, but it adds to the absurdity of the battle.  Naturally the cute blonde finds herself tied to a conveyor moving ever closer to a meat slicing band saw.  But hero sheriff rescues her and alls well that ends well.

Normally I would blast this movie, but something about it makes me want to be kinder and gentler than say, Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  This will never win an Oscar, but it never intended to anyway.",1258675200,,1217,4.331858407079646

No other comparable film intentionally makes you groan as much as this story of Vincent Smith (Rory Calhoun) and his sister Ida (Nancy Parsons) who run a cheap motel and a profitable smoked meat business that has earned a reputation because of its secret ingredient.  Take a wild guess what it might be, especially when a lot of people seem to missing once they check into the hotel (real name is Motel Hello, but the ""o"" in the neon sign is broken).  However, your jaw will drop when you find out what this crazy couple have planted in the garden out back of the motel.
Compare this to the rest of the horror flicks put out that year (""Friday the 13th,"" ""Humanoids from the Deep,"" ""Maniac,"" and ""Prom"") and you can see why ""Motel Hell"" has a singular reputation.  The only film that was close was ""Mother's Day,"" and it is really not that close when it comes to getting you to laugh, groan, and shake your head in dumb wonder.  Calhoun and Parsons milk their cannibalistic crazies for everything they are worth and this movie actually suffers when they are not on screen and we are left with the various walking slabs of meat on the menu, the beautiful less than brilliant blonde in danger (future casting director Nina Axelrod) and the loony and love-sick local cop (Paul Linke) who has not been able to connect the dots for the 30 years Farmer Vincent has been in business.  However, Wolfman Jack is around for the fun as well, and that counts for something.
The ending of ""Motel Hell"" is a mixed bag, although applying standards of logic to any splatter flick, let alone this one, is always going to be problematic.  But when the aforementioned young blonde actually falls for Vincent we are back to jaw dropping territory.  Then we remember that this entire film is filled with scenes jumping off the deep end.  Director Kevin Connor lucked out with the casting, because veteran character actor Calhoun makes this film work, both when he is being charming and when he goes crazy.  He also gets off some choice one liners, including his last words, which prove once and for all that this film is a tongue in cheek splatter flick that mixes the camp and gory in equal measure.  Like Farmer Vincent's smoked meats, ""Motel Hell"" is not going to be to everyone's tastes, but I happy to like a movie where they intend for you to laugh and groan your way through the festivities.",1067385600,4,2581,4.577006507592191
414373,3,6301971752,"Motel Hell (Kevin Connor, 1980)
I'd wanted to see this turkey ever since it got a Dog of the Week review from Siskel and Ebert. (I miss the Dog of the Week. I got a roster of much-loved films from it; if they hated it, I was sure to like it.) It was everything I hoped it would be, and less. It is, oddly, the opposite of ""how far the mighty have fallen;"" think of it as ""how amazing these folks' resumes were able to bury this.""
The movie stars former matinee idol Rory Calhoun (Night of the Lepus, The Texan, many many others) and beloved character actor Nancy Parsons (Porky's, Steel Magnolias, etc.) as a brother-and-sister team who run a motel that has a smoked-meats business on the side. (This is a comedy/horror film. You know where they're getting the meats.) Farmer Vincent (Calhoun) drives traffic to the hotel with various traps on the road (your car's incapacitated, you have to spend the night, right?). Unfortunately, one of his traps works too well, killing a biker and knocking his girlfriend Terry (Nina Axelrod of Brainstorm and Critters 3 fame) unconscious. Vincent and his sister take her in, and eventually Vincent falls in love with Terry, leading to tension between him and his sister (who doesn't want things to change) and him and the town's sheriff (veteran TV actor Paul Linke, most recently on the big screen in K-PAX), who's been courting Terry himself. And, of course, the secret ingredient in Farmer Vincent's Smoked Meats threatens to be revealed in the ensuing blow-up...
Yes, it's really as bad as it sounds. The characters are two-dimensional, though engaging, and the script's idea of comedy is... well, it was written by Robert Jaffe, who was also responsible for turning Dean Koontz' novel Demon Seed into the mess of a movie it became, so draw your own conclusions. Director Kevin Connor has done roughly equal amounts of TV and movie work before this, but after this picture, Connor was persona non grata on the film side of Hollywood for twelve years. (During which time James Cameron made Piranha II and still became one of Hollywood's biggest directors.)
But then, you don't go into a film with a name like Motel Hell expecting fine art. This is silliness in its purest form, a stupid teen comedy that just happens to be a horror movie as well. In that regard, it was rather ahead of its time, improving on the quality of such trauma-inducing sixties comedy/horror teen flicks as Horror of Party Beach, but not quite approaching the quality of something like Night of the Creeps. Looked back on a quarter of a century later, we can enjoy this for what it is-Porky's with gore. ** ",1058313600,3,2624,4.691973969631237
414374,4,6301971752,"It takes all kinds of critters to make Farmer Vincent's fritters. Actually, one of the main ingridients is people. Farmer Vincent traps unsuspecting folks on the road, fattens them up and adds them to the sausages he's been selling for the last 30 years to his motel guests, and customers all over the state. It's cartoonishly gruesome and I have to admit, one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Nancy Parsons plays the mad farmer's equally unpleasant sister and Vincent is played by sweet old Rory Calhoun.",1058140800,3,511,4.818181818181818
414375,3,6301971752,"A throwback to my childhood that scared me enough to make me want to search it out again, Motel Hell combines some genuinely creepy moments with a helping of dark comedy.
Saying the movie is about cannibalism isn't a spoiler, everyone will guess the secret to Farmer Vincent's ""fritters"" upfront.  Instead, the writers save the surprises for the viewers in the bizarre methods Farmer Vincent uses to prepare his ""product.""  It's evident the scares were largely influenced by Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but at the same time the writers intended to provide enough humor to appeal to the drive-in crowd.
Amid all the madness, the late Rory Calhoun and Nancy Parsons deliver straight and serious performances.  The rest of the cast, well... acting was never a major requirement of horror movies.  Look for John Ratzenberger, aka Cliff Claven, in a bit role as a drummer - you wouldn't even recognize him unless you knew upfront.
Descriptions such as ""masterpiece"" and ""classic"" may be a little strong.  The entire movie feels like it was done on the cheap and the gore can't hold a candle to the ultra-realistic violence of today's horror movies (it did get banned in West Germany, however.)  Consider the double-feature DVD that includes the thriller ""Deranged.""

414377,4,6301971752,"For all the diehard horror kitsch fans out there, this one's for you!  Yep...seems Rory Calhoun as Farmer Vincent, on an isolated place somewhere in the wilds of the Appalachians (or maybe the Blue Ridge Mountains, or the Great Smokies) cooks up a mighty fine batch of meats, ably assisted by his sister played by Nancy Parsons (also known for her appearances in the, you know, estimable Porky's series).
Unfortunately, these here meats is not exactly what you would call kosher.  In fact, they're HUMAN meats.  And the way that Vincent ""grows"" them is pretty strange, yessiree bob.  First you gotta capture some lowlifes like dumb bikers and dumber hippies.  Then you hafta bury them...hmmm, better not give too much away here.  The movie comes complete with a rousing chainsaw fight at the end, kinda making fun of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, cause in the fight ol' Vincent wears a wacko mask whose face I cannot reveal; it would spoil too much for ya.
Gosh darnit, if you wanna have some fun and really put your brain in a ""don't let me think, whatever you do"" kinda mode, this is the movie for you, pardner.  SEE--Farmer Vincent convince middle class buffoons how tasty his meats really are.  WATCH--as a poor unsuspecting pretty young thing is wooed by Vincent into believing she will be his wife.  GASP--as Vincent's sister (never could remember her character's name, dag nabbit) applies her ""magic"" to the new meat recruits.  And SCREAM--as our hero, a valiant young police guy does battle with the villainous Vincent.
Rory does a GREAT job here; he's a lot of fun to watch, and so is Nancy.
