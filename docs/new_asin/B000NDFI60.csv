8310572,4,B000NDFI60,"In the movie named""The Big Road"" or ""Da Lu""  The story focuses on a group of young men in Shanghai. They left and traveled around the country working in road construction,by drawing a road roller. They worked hard under the sun,but with pleasure, singing while they worked. These laborers were patriots,but their hard work was undermined by a traitorous foreman bribed by Japanese agents to sabotage the road. ""Da Lu"" was a national defense film, intended to arouse the Chinese people's patriotic feelings. The theme song ""Dalu"" is melodious. I heard that it became a popular song for left-wing groups. I can't believe this old film has a scene of male nudity watched by 2 women. It is regretful that many heroes died at the end of the movie. If they didn't die,I would give this movie 5 stars,because I prefer movies with a happy ending.
  Another movie in this DVD Disc is  ""Queen of Sports"" .This movie has a good plot when compared to many silent Chinese films of those days. Li Lili played the role of Lin Ying, a young girl who had come to Shanghai to study at a sports college. She loved climbing trees and running around in her house. She had a talent for running. The focus of this film is on training, study and competition. While training, she fell in love with her coach. In competition, she had to fight with some jealous rival classmates. She showed her sporting spirit at the end of the movie.",1370995200,2,1408,4.575396825396825
