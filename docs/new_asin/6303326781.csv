However I used to watch this as a kid and loved this show so much!!  At 15, I just happened to find it on Television, and I just had to stop and watch the show to think about old times, sitting at home on my couch all alone watching this show and drinking some cola...

I've talked about it with my friends before too, because one of them mentioned it one time, and they all loved it as smaller kids too.

624740,1,6303326781,"I laughed so hard through out this whole movie.  It is very stupid.  The plot is a good troll lives in a world with bad trolls.  The good troll has a magical green thumb, and he can make talking flowers.  The bad trolls can turn things to stone.  The bad trolls find out he is making flowers and banish him to new york city but he ends up in central park.  He meets two smal children.  The rest of the movie is just a weird acid trip.  The movie is ful of bright colors and plot holes.  I'm sure younger children might enjoy the movie, I did but only because the movie was stupid.  Hehe",1097366400,11,586,4.017391304347826
624741,3,6303326781,"There seem to be several negative reviews. I admit, Don Bluth as made some crap in the past few years. Titan AE, Anastasia. But you have to admit, this wasn't all that bad. The fact of the matter is, it's for kids. Bluth's movies typically had content that was a quite intense for G-rated movies, this was probably just his break from that. I'll admit, this isn't the best movie ever made, but it did what it set out to do. It made a cute kid movie. And I think they did a good job.

624743,4,6303326781,This is not one of the best animated cartoons out their nor is the story plot but when I was ages 8-11 this movie was da bomb.

624744,5,6303326781,"What I learned from this film is that there are good people in the internet trolling community.  People like Stanley.  People whose passion for floral gardening leads them to crosspost to rec.politics.socialist and alt.binaries.erotica.lesbians instead of confining their gardening advice to rec.gardening.floral where it belongs.
Trolls like Stanley are basically ok, if eccentric people who need to be taught netiquette.  They are not the malicious evil trolls such as can be found on alt.trolls, alt.syntax.tactical or alt.tasteless.
Anyway, on to the plot.  In this film, Stanley, a basically good troll, is driven our of the troll kingdom (alt.tasteless) by an evil troll queen. (they hate gardeining in alt.tasteless, but then again, they hate everything.)  He is sent to ""central park"", a large, public area filled with all sorts of people.  ""Central Park"" is obviously a metaphor for Slashdot.org.  Since usenet trolls consider weblog trolls to be a lower form of life, this is indeed exile.  Anyway, he befriends two children who, like most slashdot readers, are neglected by their parents far too much.
Stanley does well in ""Central Park"" until he is attacked by the evil troll queen who wants to turn him to stone.  This is obviously a reference to the frequent ""Natalie Portman naked and petrified"" posts that trolls often make.
Stanley and his two young friends must defeat the evil troll queen and learn the important of focused, ontopic posting.
Do they succeed, do they fail?  Watch the film and find out.

624745,1,6303326781,"I've rented the cassette to watch with my son and sat stunned through the film - just could not comprehend how someone in 1994 could come up with such ridiculous piece of nothing. Perhaps the characters' design took only a couple hours - or the film's ""cute"" kids were copied from a box of some obscure off-brand cereal - they are sickeningly cheesy.  The final shots of Manhattan being strangled by these predatory lianas building by building look as a horror film culmination. I do not want to elaborate on the songs and gags - it's all very inferior.
I am no big fan of Disney, but at least they have a basic idea of the quality control - I can not remember any obvious flops leaving their assembly line. Yes, their product became uninspired and cliched but I do not believe they are capable of presenting us with an idiocy of A Troll...'s level.

The plot is easy  enough for a preschooler to follow, and Stanley, the good-hearted troll who  wants to put his ""green finger"" to use in Central Park, is  indeed, truly lovable!

***

This was a great film for children...and especially adults. Why? Precisely because of how simple and innocent it is. Lots of viewers ridicule this movie for how ""unrealistic"" and ""sappy"" it supposedly is, but what's really sad is a world in which love, giving, and innocence are considered unrealistic. Perhaps if more adults saw this delightful wonder of a film they would have a change of heart.

Here is a plot summary:

The lovable flower growing troll, Stanley (Dom DeLuise), is kicked out of the kingdom for not being hateful enough for the evil queen Gnorga (Cloris Leachman), and for creating dreadful flowers with his green thumb. Gnorga decides to banish him to New York City because nothing grows there...or so she thinks. Lucky Stanley lands in Central Park and finds it delightful, but is soon accidentally relocated to a gloomy underground cave under a bridge. Meanwhile, toddler Rosie and older brother Gus aren't getting enough attention from their busy working parents, so Gus takes Rosie to Central Park on his own when they leave.

Rosie falls down the hole and discovers Stanley, and they instantly bond. Gus comes tumbling after her, becomes angry, but then softens up when Stanley shows him how to create a dream world just by wishing. They sail away on a magical ship to a land of happy trolls and eventually return to Central Park, where Gnorga attacks them with a tornado and Rosie is kidnapped. Gus tries to get Stanley to fight, but he is too scared. Stanley eventually stands up to Gnorga and turns her into a flower bush, but is turned to stone himself when Gus, turned into a troll himself by Gnorga, is forced to touch Stanley with a purple thumb.

At the end of the movie, the parents return and take the kids to Central Park, where Gus revives stone Stanley with his own newfound green thumb. Stanley's love makes all of NYC grow with flowers.

The animation is lovely, the concepts creative (both the plot and the actual movements of the characters and scenery). There is actually a point where we see a boat sailing through a cave, and at the cave opening is a beautiful sunset, and another in which a lovely rose blooms through a window.

There are probably some plot holes, but I won't look for them because that's not the point of this movie. The point of the movie is to develop love and loyalty for others and to focus on creation.

Troll Stanley is like a child who never grew up and views the world around him in a very optimistic way. The kids- the toddler Rosie especially- behave realistically and are lifelike, both when playing with their surroundings and speaking to each other. Rosie is so tender and gentle you would want her for your own, and, next to Stanley, is the best thing about this movie. A lot of people think this makes the movie sickeningly sweet and unrealistic, but what could be more realistic than a baby girl acting this way?

There is some hint of cynicism and realistic human (and troll?) behavior, though like I've said it is never where the theme goes and is always rectified. The children have to deal with parents who are too occupied with work life to bond with them, Gus is mean to his sister, and Stanley is reluctant to save his beloved Rosie's life because he thinks he will be killed.

The scene which best sums up the spirit of the film is that in which Stanley and Gnorga wage a thumb war: her purple thumb tries to turn him into stone (evil) while his green one tries to overcome it with life and love (good). It's actually a very Christian message, if that's what you're looking for in a children's film.

The music, by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, are excellent both lyrically and in terms of music. They could be played on the radio as pop songs if the right person sang them, and the way they accompany the animation onscreen draws you into the story.

Overall, this is a great choice for children and adults alike (though some nostalgia on my part may make me biased with regard to this). There is little that could really scare a child unless they were very young, and very important lessons- loyalty, bravery, love, gentleness, family, creation- are contained in it. Even among other childrens' films we don't find these things displayed with such lovable audacity, and this is why it sometimes gets derided as diabetes-inducing.

To tell the truth, its audacity and straightforwardness are exactly why is works and this directness is needed to get forth the message with the most honesty. What are these values worth if we apologize for them or sour them up to make them more ""believable"" for a jaded audience?",1483315200,,4632,4.646699266503667

The movie itself is good, but as an adult I did not enjoy it as much as I did when I was child.  I found that there was a lot of the movie that I'd forgotten, so it was interesting to re-watch all these years later.

The troll's in-your-face attraction for the two year old girl is unnerving at best and sickening at worst.  I realize it was intended to be lighthearted and that I shouldn't take it so seriously, but it's really just creepy and I definitely don't want my kids to think that type of behaviour is acceptable.

Ok, look.  I know this movie is intended for toddlers, but I know for a fact if I saw this movie as a kid, I'd have turn it off because it's so blasted cutesy and just plain idiotic.  I mean, take a classic family picture like the Wizard of Oz, and what do you get out of it? It's funny, exciting, and has such clever, whimsical writing that even adults will watch and enjoy it.  And it's got good morals--to believe in yourself and to try not to be unselfish, and caring.  I, myself,  at the age of 30 still love The Wizard of Oz. But this movie is a form of cinematic torture for adults, or at least it should be.  What does it offer? It offers nothing but an hour and a half of smiling, singing, and dancing.  That's it.  And as far as the 'lesson', it tries to tell the importance of having a dream, but it does so in such a convoluted manner, it's preposterous. Not only that, I find it actually a tad bit condescending that this movie offers the same amount of mindless, pandering drivel as an episode of ""Barney and Friends"". Why do adults look down their noses so much at children to think they will watch anything? Look, I'm not saying that a little cuteness is bad for a kid, as long as it's done correctly.  Take Seseme Street(or what used to be Seseme Street before it turned into the Elmo Show), its cute.  But at least something like Sesame Street teaches your kids Math, the Alphabet, counting, equality, and even other languages (I learned how to count 1-10 in Spanish on that). All I can say is, view at your own risk.  I know that parenting skills vary from house to house, all I can say is, if you want to show your kids this, fine. I just wouldn't recommend it.",1336867200,,1751,4.225225225225225

The story drags, and by the end you could careless about what happens to the troll. I think one of the reasons I never cared for this was because I compared it to Bluth's other films. I loved Land Before Time, Thumbelina, All Dogs Go TO Heaven, heck, I even enjoyed Rock a Doodle...but this? Not so good. It's as if he had run out of imagination when creating this stinker.

The story begins with Stanley, a kind-hearted troll with the ability to change ugly things into flowers.  Gnorga, the queen of the troll world thinks that everything should be ugly and barren in their world.  She banishes poor Stanley to New York City thinking that would be a truly hard place to grow anything for his punishment. Stanley is at first very lonely and sad but soon transforms his sewer home into a wonderful world of gorgeous landscape with singing flowers and trees.  He befriends two lonely little children,Gus and Rosie, who fall into his new home and soon they all take off into a fairytale land where everything is green and growing. Cute songs to go along with the movie that you will find yourself singing along with. Gnorga, checking on her newly banished troll, finds Stanley doing just fine in his new world and has come to New York to investigate.  She stirs up plenty of trouble for Stanley and his friends Rosie and and Gus.  New York City is beginning to look ugly.  Can Stanley fight off his nemesis and bring about his peaceful world of green beauty and save his friends Rosie and Gus?  You bet!  This film had a wonderful vocie casting of actors like Dom Deluise, Cloris Leachmand, and Charles Nelson Reilly. Please take a look at this wonderful film.  Good for young and old alike.
