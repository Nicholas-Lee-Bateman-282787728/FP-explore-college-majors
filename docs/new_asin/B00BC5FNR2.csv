5577034,5,B00BC5FNR2,"This is a very good movie if you are into horror.  Jack Lord is very good as the Hungarian drifter (not a bad accent either)
The woman are enough to scare the living daylights out of you.  Won't let the secret out (but if you are a movie buff like me you will have guessed the ending)  This movie made in 1968 just before Hawaii 5-0. Jack Lord in very convincing as the hitch- hiker, perhaps one would say the Hungarian was in fact stupid to hang around.  Good watching (day-time the best time to watch)",1369526400,2,503,4.208333333333333
5577035,5,B00BC5FNR2,"THE NAME OF THE GAME IS KILL (1968) is a film that has been difficult to view for decades.  After a nearly ten year gestation period from script to finished product, the film opened one day after Robert Kennedy was murdered.  As a result of that disastrous timing, the film sunk like a stone in most markets.  It finally appeared on local TV stations in the early 1970's under the arguably better alternate title THE FEMALE TRAP.  It has seldom been seen since.

VCI now presents the American home video debut of this nearly forgotten, low-budget psychodrama.  Based on a real life family (!), the story follows a Hungarian refugee (played by Jack Lord right before HAWAII FIVE-O) who's adrift in a small Arizona town.  An attractive young woman (Susan Strasberg) picks him up on a highway and brings him home to meet her weird family, which includes her loopy mother and her two oddball sisters.  The siblings each have conflicting recollections of a dreadful event from their distant past.  Things become more sinister as each of the sisters makes advances toward the hapless drifter.

The film is really a mood piece, a southwestern gothic if you will.  It is not a splatter film, although some blood is indeed spilled.  It's more of a mystery which unfolds RASHOMON-style, with the siblings dealing with their own overlapping recollections of the past.

VCI's new DVD presents an anamorphic widescreen transfer from two 16MM prints, the most suitable film elements located after a search of several years.  Apparently, there are no satisfactory surviving 35MM materials.  The transfer is thusly a bit soft, but it's the best we're likely to see given the film's scarcity.

The DVD is chock-full of entertaining supplements.  There is a 45 minute documentary about the film's checkered history, a three minute portrait of the rock band The Electric Prunes (who perform a song on the soundtrack), and a gallery of advertising materials such as behind-the-scenes stills, lobby cards, pressbook and poster art.  The original screenwriter has contributed an audio commentary track during which he describes much conflict among some of the film's principals.  There's also a 45 minute collection of exploitation trailer previews from producer Joe Solomon, who finally released THE NAME OF THE GAME IS KILL under his Fanfare distribution banner.

It's always great fun to see these forgotten shockers surface on DVD, even with their inherent imperfections.  This disc has been a labor of love for the independent horror genre buffs who refused to allow this film to remain buried.  Given the array of publicity materials and insider stories on display, this has become one of my favorite DVD releases of the year.",1366502400,21,2710,5.0291479820627805
8565837,3,B00BC5FNR2,The shocking ending? No ... obvious us more like it. Lame.,1506643200,,58,4.363636363636363
8565838,5,B00BC5FNR2,"I mainly don't watch horror, but this was exception because it's more thriller than horror film. I also know it was great film in the 60's so I had to get it. Seeing as I missed out a lot being born in 1973, hehe. Can't imagine for those living in the 80's who missed out even more than I did and by that  I also mean great  film, no remakes of anything. Even the horror films at that time were scarier than the new because they had serious context and were aimed at your psyche more than just to scare you.

Anyway here's Jack Lord, the guy(Hawaii-Five-0&Stoney Burke and others) who just wanders along the road meeting a girl who is to pick him up because 'she likes his looks'...He ends of living with family of only females and to help them manage the gas station, STRANGE females who has furnace in the backyard... Something strange happen- the area is totally isolated nobody seems to live there except this family and a nearby pub. The film location is Ghost town even nowadays. It was perfect shooting place and the story will draw you emotionally more than physically. The name of the game is persuade first, and do something later. You'll have to watch as to what.
There is a great twist at the end and most moviegoers won't even guess. But I won't tell the secret because in the prelude it said not to tell .:).
It's unique thriller so worth the money. I vote 5 stars!",1505088000,,1379,4.357976653696498
8565839,4,B00BC5FNR2,"I'm a fan of 60s cinema so I like it.  Not really a horror movie fan, but the director Joe Dante, from the extras, liked it for its visual composition, so it is quite watchable for that reason.  I mainly came to this because of the wonderful Electric Prunes song, Shadows, which features in one scene, as well as being heard as an instrumental by unknown.  Picture quality is not ideal though, due to difficulties in getting a decent print, this one comes from Joe Dante.  A lot seems to have gone into this dvd release, as you can tell from the introduction to the movie, and the numerous extras.  It does have a twist near the end, 60s cinema fans might see it coming.",1493164800,,670,4.328
8565840,5,B00BC5FNR2,Pretty goofy movie but if you live where this was filmed you get a trip down memory lane with all the scenery in the background. Seeing some of the locals from back then in the Spirit Room bar was great!,1457308800,,203,4.1
8565841,4,B00BC5FNR2,Deliciously creepy movie. Weird characters and situations.,1453680000,,58,7.428571428571429
8565842,4,B00BC5FNR2,"This movie is fun, creepy, bizarro and beautifully-filmed. (However, the ""top secret"" shocking ending was predicted by me about 15 minutes into the film. We're apparently much more jaded now than folks were in 1968, and not so easily shocked.) What we loved most about the film was the locations used in the movie, much of it filmed in a historic garage that is (still) located in our neighborhood in Clarkdale, Arizona. Also lots of great footage in neighboring Jerome, Arizona, now a very popular tourist attraction but at the time of filming still very much a ghost town. Lots of fun for us to see local scenes throughout--definitely the highlight for us-- but as a fan of weird old B-movies I also found the movie's plot engaging and strange. Friends told us about this film, which is hard to find (not available on Netflix, never on TV), so I was grateful Amazon offers it. We're happy to have it in our movie library.",1426636800,,923,4.634146341463414
8565843,5,B00BC5FNR2,Great movie,1383782400,,11,5.0
8565844,1,B00BC5FNR2,This is one of the craziest movies ever! Print quality is good so if you've been hoping that someone would dig up this thing you should be pleased. I saw this when I was in the service and I remembered it was pretty nutty but I didn't remember that it was pretty boring.,1380067200,,270,4.113207547169812
8565845,4,B00BC5FNR2,"I bought this mainly because I think Tisha Sterling is one of the most alluring beauties from the seventies. This is a great role for her, and she does a dance that is an iconic perfomance in and of itself. That said, all of the other actors (and there aren't many of them!) are good, even the brief appearance of Mort Mills (Psycho -- the highway patrolman) is good, with perhaps a nod back to his earlier role.  Jack Lord, Susan Strasberg, and Collin Paxton make their roles memorable.  Best of all this was lensed by no less than Vilmos Zsigmond (Deliverance, Heaven's Gate, The Deerhunter) who might as well be a second director due to the quality of his cinematography. The movie itself is a bit confusing and in the end just ok -- I enjoyed the atmosphere, cinematography, and general wierdness a lot more. This DVD has abundant extras, including an amusing making of documentary (interviews with Zsigmond, Joe Dante, and the screenwriter, Gary Crutcher, as well as the lead vocalist for the Electric Prunes, James Lowe, and a short documentary on the Electric Prunes, who performed a song for the movie (where I also found out they have reformed and actually are looking good!).  VCI has done a great job on this with the presentation and extras (are you listening, Olive Films?).  This film was thought lost for many years and it is great that it is now available.  Highly recommended.",1370044800,11,1393,4.692622950819672
8565846,3,B00BC5FNR2,"After hearing some praise about this being a forgotten gem with a great twist, I had to check it out. I was kind of disappointed, but The Name of the Game is Kill was still mildly entertaining. I like desert thrillers and the cast is pretty good. The twist, however, was predictable to me.

Image quality is not great (a bit soft), but it's watchable. Pretty amusing interview with the screenwriter in the extras. All in all, not a must-have, but a decent time-waster if you like 70's junk.",1369526400,4,490,4.50561797752809
