731657,4,6303869041,"I was prepared to dislike this work after having seen the awful companion pieces, ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs,"" and ""Liszt's Rhapsody"" (see reviews). In contrast, this work is a pleasant surprise.
The scenery (in the Czech Republic) is gorgeous and the photography is superb. The story advances through the eyes of a servant boy in the Duke's palace, a good device for a film aimed at kids. Although there is a lot of ""artistic license"" with the facts of Bach's life, there is enough music and an interesting enough story to encourage further reading and listening.
And what better result, for children especially, could you ask?",1017187200,9,627,4.980952380952381
731658,5,6303869041,"This video offers an excellent window into the personality of Johann Sebastian Bach although it is as much fiction as fact. I highly recommend this for children who have an interest in learning about the great  composer, or even teenagers would enjoy it. It is about as accurate as  ""Amadeus"" was about Mozart: some myth, some screenplay, and many  historically accurate facts as well. Overall, this is a valuable story  about one of our greatest composers, and it is in many ways a praiseworthy  film.",962841600,17,502,4.858823529411764
731659,5,6303869041,One of the high-quality films in the composer series.  In this one a young boy encounters Bach as young man frustrated by a patron trying to dampen the composer's creativity.  An entertaining fictional story based on actual  fact. Kids like it!,949190400,,244,4.902439024390244
731720,5,6303869041,"This video is filled with the music of Bach, plus presents a lively story involving a young boy who is Bach's helper.  It is appropriate for children of all ages, but I believe particularly engaging for 7-12 year olds.

731721,5,6303869041,"Our daughter loves to watch this video because it keeps her involved with a good story and gets the style of Bach's music into her ears. She now knows who Bach is and enjoys listening to his music outside of what's in this video. The point of these DVDs are to create curiosity, develop love of music, art and science while familiarizing children to important musicians, artists and scienctists. This way, children will not be intimidated by classical music, wonderful art, possibly get inspired to become more involved in science and innovations. We wish there are more!",1161129600,7,571,4.896907216494846
731722,1,6303869041,"""Live life with passion"" is the theme of this Bach biopic from Sony. The music and scenery are tremendous, yet some music is played at a time (1717-1719) before it was really composed. The serious student of Bach knows his life was driven by faith, doing all things to the glory of God. The ""passion"" here is nebulous. Some parts are interesting, but the main theme of the film loses the point.",1149206400,5,394,4.486111111111111
731723,4,6303869041,"I show this to third grade elementary general music students each school year.  It is, at the very least, a way to show what people may have looked like in Bach's time.  Bach's music is played throughout, which is wonderful.  The most appealing thing is that it is a fun story for children to watch.  That's enough all by itself.

The only thing that concerns me is the fiction.  Bach was a man deeply faithful in his place and duty before God as a musician.  This doesn't come across in the least.  Unfortunately, one's religion almost never makes it to the final cut of children's movies no matter how vital it is to the truth and reality about a person of historical significance.  That seems to be more artistic license than ought to be allowed.

Just the same, the story is fun.  If this helps a child become interested in Bach, the Baroque period or classical music at all, or inspires in any way a child to one day know more of the truth about the real Johann Sebastian Bach, I give it a thumb up.",1136851200,11,1004,4.344086021505376
731724,3,6303869041,"Since the videos in this series are just about the only child-friendly introductions to these composers on the market, and children do seem to like them, it is easy to forgive their many flaws.  And this one does have MANY flaws.  It is chock full of inaccuracies in virtually every scene, has very badly-written dialogue and scenes, falls flat in terms of drama and suspense and goes down in history for one of the worst, most blatant uses of ""deus ex machina"" at the end that will be sure to disappoint even young children.  There's also a scene where an actor holds a recorder to his lips (or at least, close to his lips) while a flute is playing on the soundtrack!  Some parents may also disapprove of Bach and other characters drinking what appears to be wine, and Bach's comment about kicking one of the other characters in the ... (his wife stops him short). Nevertheless, the videography is compelling, the music is wonderful, the boy is ADORABLE and children find the Duke to be particularly amusing.  To sum up:  Despite the movie's drawbacks, there is hardly a better method available to introduce children to Bach and Baroque music in general.",1065657600,15,1155,4.693069306930693
731725,5,6303869041,"This was one of the deepest, and still educational, movies I have seen in a long time.  I am a huge fan of Bach and I am pleased with this tormented and misunderstood portrayal of the man who is Bach.  The soundtrack is excellent, the acting superior, and the story, though mostly fiction, is convincing and makes the movie that much more interesting.",1029888000,9,351,4.555555555555555

7855675,5,6303869041,"Great teaching series for kids as well as production values, I only wish they would do more - Mozart, Stravinsky and Brahms would have been nice additions!",1415145600,,155,4.777777777777778
7855676,4,6303869041,"Okay, so we can't prove that most of the characters in this movie ever existed, but there are still grains of truth in this little fantasy. Bach *did* have a stormy temper, particularly when his patrons yanked him around at their whim and fancy. He *did* sometimes have some trouble getting anyone to encourage or financially support his secular works. And he *most definitely* faced a quandary of what to do with his life, torn between providing for his large family and suffering under the monotony of being a chess piece to noblemen.

Alright, so the acting isn't top-notch, but if I understand correctly, this was really only meant to be a short movie for children, not a historically accurate and Olivier-quality piece for the grown-ups. It's still pretty cute. It still puts a positive light on classical music, and it suggests the idea that it was far from just stuffy music played by people in dumb white wigs. The people who wrote it were dreamers, bravely bold and boldly brave, often risky and not always accepted the first time around. Many famous classical composers were deeply imperfect people who were just trying to get their ideas out there and perhaps scrape a living together. Bach had fire in his belly and everyone knew it, and he had to reconcile that with the rules-heavy world of his day, for the entire duration of his (sometimes constricted) life.  Yes, this program has ""messages,"" but many videos for children DO have messages, and the ones in here are good!

Is it hoaky? Yes. Historically inaccurate? Yes. A pointless waste of 50 minutes? No!!! I have seen children watch this movie and turn it over in their little heads. This is still one of the less goofy ways out there to subtly expose children to classical music without bogging them down with music theory they won't remotely understand. This isn't a constant cringe-fest like some other tripe they push on children these days. I would rather get a child interested in great music and explain inaccuracies later instead of just make the entire experience a chore from the very beginning. This little movie has some glimmers of real grace in it, and that's worth watching no matter the inaccuracies and amateur production. This was basically a sincere effort and I choose to take my hat off to them for trying.",1372723200,,2297,4.7808564231738035
7855677,5,6303869041,"As an elementary music teacher I LOVE having this video series.  All of the titles are great and are perfect for third, fourth, and fifth grade students.  It teaches them about the composer, they hear the composers greatest works, yet incorporating a child about their own age gives them a way to relate to the characters.  Bach's Fight for Freedom is one of their favorites.",1331769600,,375,4.7384615384615385
7855678,5,6303869041,"This is video follows in the footsteps of the rest of the series.

Very rarely do these presentations represent real events in the life of the particular artist, composer or scientist.

That isn't the point.

This series was created to attract young people into the creative or scientific work of famous people.  It does so by introducing a young child into the drama.

The story usually revolves around one of the master's famous creative works.
It is usually the young person who contributes toward the master (or female master)finalizing his or masterpiece (s).

One of the reviewers was disappointed that the DVD didn't focus on J S Bach's religious concerns.  Again, that is not goal of this series.  That is your concern, not that of the series creators.

Many people are not interested in that aspect of Bach.

In fact, the U.S. will eventually be a much better place when people are much less concerned with religious dogma and more concerned with creating a just, humane and much more creative society.",1282780800,,1011,4.859649122807017
7855679,4,6303869041,"It is a very good introduction of young kids to music and how people lived in Germany in the first half of XVIII century. My 9.5 years daughter really enjoyed it. It reminded her about story of Pilgrims coming to America.
Although the story was probably fictional it was interesting since it had one main topic and a moral dilemma. Who should a person be loyal to and what is more important -  loyalty or passion.

I did not rate it with 5 stars since some parts of the movie were not consistent. In the beginning Bach is presented  as an angry, almost violent man, then he is becoming a very understanding and even compromising, although he never compromises his music. Good action, nice costumes, I wish it was more factual and it talks more about Bach's music and his life in overall and less about a small boy who was so perfect and almost saved bach's freedom. But maybe this is a reason why children like it because they can identify with this small boy.",1265760000,,960,4.443181818181818
7855680,1,6303869041,"Thank God I have this only on VHS.. Not only is the story completely untrue and fanciful, but the script and acting are just plain awful. Save your money and do not waste it on a DVD.  This is not even rent-worthy.",1256601600,4,214,4.095238095238095
