3173523,4,B0017LRZ04,"It might sound unlikely, but ""CJ7"" is a family picture, directed by Stephen Chow who is probably best known for his two recent comedies ""Shaolin Soccer"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle."" Chinese-made ""CJ7"" is also a comedy, and a very well-made one, but if you expect the same kind of comedy Stephen Chow had done before, you might be disappointed.

First, though Stephen Chow plays an important role, his role is a supporting one in ""CJ7."" ""CJ7"" follows the story of a boy named Dicky (Xu Jiao), son of Ti (Stephen Chow), a laborer working at a construction site. The work is hard and Ti is not rich (actually, very poor), but the father spends every money he earns to send Dicky to a prestigious elementary school. But Dicky is not very happy as he is picked on by other rich kids at school.

One night Ti finds a strange green thing in the junkyard. He brings it home and gives it to his son as a present without knowing a UFO (yes, a big flying saucer) had left the thing behind. But it is a great present for the boy because Dicky finds a new friend in a new ""toy"" - CJ7 - a tiny puppy-like creature (?) which, it seems, has special powers - or maybe not.

It is hard to explain the charms of Stephen Chow's latest film. In ""CJ7"" a familiar theme of love and friendship (like ""E.T."" of course) is developed to make a heart-felt comedy through a convincing portrait of a father-and-son / son-and-creature relationship, but the plot also contains slapsticks, spoofs (from ""MI2"" to Japanese popular manga ""Doraemon""), comic fight scenes created by special effects and one toilet joke.

You may take the film as satire targeting modern fast-changing society of China, and believe me or not, ""CJ7"" is also a serious drama (or melodrama) with tearjerking moments. The film will be criticized for its storytelling, which some may call whimsical or even slack, but others may think Chow as director is only making his film subversive, avoiding the pitfalls of comedies and family pictures, especially predictability.

[THIS PARAGRAPH HAS MILD SPOILERS] Speaking of subversive, please watch the faces of the supporting actors/actresses closely and you may notice an interesting thing. Xu Jiao, who plays the boy Dicky, is really a girl (she had to have her long hair cut for the role); Han Yong Wua, Dicky's ""love interest"" is actually a male; and two bullying boys of the school, Johnny and his ""bodyguard,"" are played by Huang Lei and 23-year-old Yao Wen Xue, both females.

""CJ7"" is less like other over-the-top comedies Stephen Chow did in ""Shaolin Soccer"" and his films made in the 90s (such as ""Forbidden City Cop,"" a must for any Stephen Chow fans). In his latest film Stephen Chow takes the backseat to flesh out the characters Dicky and ""CJ7"" in particular and develop their stories. ""CJ7"" is a nice comedy, funny, and sometimes eccentric and surreal, and it also has a dramatic story driven by the characters you identify with.",1219536000,3,2921,4.6953125
3173524,4,B0017LRZ04,This is unlike his other movies but viewing it in the proper context makes it still o.k. After all it is highlighting the misery of poverty and prejudice. Parts of it made me cry but over all it made me laugh. Also its something the entire family can view together.,1219104000,,265,4.32
3173525,2,B0017LRZ04,"I like Stephen Chow's work.  Especially Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle.  (I have Kung Fu Hustle on DVD, Blu-Ray and UMD.)

I pre-ordered this DVD without seeing it first.  I wish I had seen the movie in the theater first.  It is not what I expected.  Yes, it is probably intended to be a ""family film.""  That's perfectly fine.  However, I cannot imagine sitting down and watching this with any young kids.  Unless of course it's pouring raining outside and they just watched ""Bambi"" and ""Old Yeller"" back to back.  That will prepare them for what is to come in this movie.

There is some cute stuff in the movie.  But there is also some content that might be difficult or emotional for some kids.

The brief homages to Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle and Mission: Impossible II were nice.

I never would have bought this DVD if I had seen the movie first.  I will definitely have to watch Stephen Chow's next movie before buying the DVD.

You can buy this DVD, but keep tissues nearby while watching.",1218758400,,1002,4.483333333333333
3173526,4,B0017LRZ04,"Very well presented tale about a poor laborer and his child who'se lives

film we end up with a pretty good little movie...good for kids and adults.",1218758400,2,288,4.5576923076923075
3173527,5,B0017LRZ04,"This movie was really enjoyable. It's a family kind of movie, but that shouldn't turn you off from watching it if you think that means it won't be as good as Chow's other recent films. His great sense of humor is throughout the movie, and it even has a parody of Kung Fu Hustle in it.

It is in Chinese, and I highly recommend you don't watch it dubbed if that's an option. There's a specific gag that would probably be a lot less funny if you aren't listening to the original audio track.",1217980800,2,489,4.202127659574468
3173528,5,B0017LRZ04,"i already imported this from hong kong and it is a great transfer, actually looks better than it did at the theater i saw it at.

if you like any of stephen chow's other movies (shaolin soccer, kung foo hustle) you will like this one as well. some of the same actors, the same goofy style of acting and over the top theatrics. but this time there is an alien and a nice story. think of a chinese version of E.T. sort of. the part of the little boy in the movie is actually played by a girl and she does a great job.

do yourself a favor and at least rent it, it shouldn't be missed (besides its only 87 minutes long). when i went to the theater, there were only 6 other people in there with me. it really deserved better publicity than it got.

by far it was the best movie the first 6 months of this year until the summer blockbusters started coming out.",1217289600,21,855,4.0773809523809526
3173529,3,B0017LRZ04,"Different from Stephen Chow's other films (Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle), CJ7 is an alright, fun one and a half hour family friendly experience.

It takes some getting used to, however since it's a family film and on top of that, Chow doesn't really play the main character. Plus not a whole lot of kung-fu action...

Yeah the CGI effects are cheesy but all in all a light-hearted somewhat touching film. It's not a must-see Stephen Chow film but if you're looking for something to watch when you're bored - CJ7 will suffice.",1217203200,,527,4.655913978494624

When this first came out I had a copy of it and my nephews and nieces would watch this over and over nearly everyday. Needless to say, one of their favorites. One of my nephews was 4 and one of the nieces 3 and they couldn't get by in a day without it. Their older sister asked me a couple of months ago about this and it prompted me to search for it and buy it for her. Even at 16 now, she loves this and it's a great memory for her. So I surprised her with this purchase. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. I'm personally not one for the subtitles so I was really glad that the options were there for the English dubs and turning the subtitles off. After all, I did have to make sure the video was up to par and looked good so I watched it before getting it to her. :D ;)",1486857600,,933,3.9157894736842107

3173560,5,B0017LRZ04,"CJ7 is a hidden gem (at least in America) from Stephen Chow. I watched it with my wife and we were very entertained by Chow's usual off-beat humor and exaggerated situations. Surprisingly, much of the movie is actually very serious and sad, which makes me think that it might be enjoyed more by adults than children. The real star of the show is the young boy Dicky who's performance is simply incredible. I'm not sure why the ratings are so low for this movie, but definitely watch it with subtitles, as the English dub takes you away from the experience (as always).",1465516800,3,568,4.578431372549019

3173638,3,B0017LRZ04,"There really isn't much Stephen Chow in 'CJ7', so don't bother watching it for his appearances. Most of the screen time is taken up following a young boy who's poor father (Chow) works very hard to send to a private school. The boy does not fit in with the affluent and aggressive students, and his problems become complicated by the arrival of an alien pet his father finds in the dump.

Fans of Chow's films may greatly enjoy the scenes where the young boy dreams of the miraculous things his new pet might accomplish for him at his school. One of these scenes features a hilarious homage to 'Kung Fu Hustle' that was worth the price of the movie for me, but which would be lost on someone unfamiliar with that film.

Overall: the plot is painfully predictable, the peril the alien pet is placed in is too intense for very young viewers, the romantic sub-plot is underdeveloped, and there is just too little Stephen Chow.

Some of the reviewers of this wonderful film seem to ignore those basic facts.

I can't recall many movies that have tugged on so many emotions in such a short span of time - I laughed, I cried, and I walked away from the movie feeling hopeful about tomorrow.

3173647,4,B0017LRZ04,"Youngsters will get a real kick out of ""CJ7,"" a delightful sci-fi comedy from China that should satisfy any child's requirements for a wish-fulfillment fantasy.

Dicky is a grade school boy who lives in an abandoned, dilapidated and roach-infested building with his father, an uneducated laborer who works construction jobs during the day so he can afford to send his boy to a posh private school, and then scavenges the local dumpsites for throw-away items (worn-out shoes, a busted fan) at night.  Due to his low class upbringing and background, as reflected in his unkempt mien and disheveled appearance, Dicky has become a constant target of bullying and ridicule at school - until, that is, he comes into possession of a mysterious ""toy,"" or possibly an alien from outer space, that gives the lad the ability to perform feats of astonishing physical and mental dexterity, to the great amazement and amusement of his fellow students.  Yet, could this little creature (whom Dicky dubs CJ7, after a similar toy made here on earth) wind up causing the boy more trouble than it saves him in the long run?

Although the sci-fi aspects can become a bit cutesy and cheesy at times, the real strength of the film lies in its beautifully observed relationship between a down-on-his-luck father who's doing all he can to instill the values of hard work and honesty into his boy, and a son who'd rather spend his time devising ways to get out of doing his schoolwork so he can spend all his time playing with his new-found friend from outer space.  It's that father/son relationship that keeps the story grounded in reality and that gives plausibility and weight to the more fantastical elements of the tale.  Xu Jiao (who is actually a girl in real life) and Stephen Chow (who also co-wrote and directed the film) are utterly charming, winning and appealing as Dicky and his dad, respectively, and they are matched by a whole host of wonderful supporting players, both of the full-sized and the pint-sized variety.

Like all good stories aimed at kids, ""CJ7"" is just chock-full of rock-solid values like tolerance, acceptance, discipline and hard work, yet it never feels the need to preach or talk down to its audience.  Instead, the values filter their way through a well-told story - which, of course, is as it should be.

Sentimental in the best sense of that term - with a hint of ""The Kid"" here, a touch of ""E.T."" there - ""CJ7"" provides near-perfect entertainment for the young, as well as those still young enough to remember what it was like to be young.",1281398400,,2556,4.777777777777778

3173652,5,B0017LRZ04,"I don't normally write reviews, but I was shocked by the few (and I do mean few) negative reviews of this film. It inspired me to write a positive review, if for no other reason than to give this film its worth.

I'll say from the start that I am biased. I have seen a number of Stephen Chow's films (including the boring Justic Is My Foot). I am a fan. I find his humor a combination of wit and slapstick. There is a strong level of intelligence and appreciatiation for the absurd (think Looney Tunes).

While Stephen Chow is known for his slapstick adult humor, it was less surprising to me that HE had made a childrens' film than to hear that Takashi Miike had made a children's film (""The Great Yokai War""). None the less, I was skeptical. Could Stephen Chow transcend the greatest folly of childrens' films? The greatest folly is, of course, the over-simplifying of the world to a point where it has no relevance in reality, except as a delusional acid trip. Adults of all kinds tend to fall into the chasm of under-estimation. They all think that children can not handle the real world. While I agree that some things are worth waiting to tell a child until she/he has matured, other things, being natural to life and the human condition, should be confronted in a respectful and meaningful fashion. This film does that.

This film does not skirt around the consequences of one's actions. This film faces them bold-facedly. *SPOILER* Even though the film has a happy family ending, it does not pretend that jealousy does not happen; that rage does not motivate actions; that death does not exist. The normal kids' emotions are not just explored but dealt with as if Stephen Chow were writing about his kids.

This film is a testament to what kids films should be like.
I give this film the highest rating!!

3173655,2,B0017LRZ04,"I appreciate other reviewers here cautioning us as to the content of this movie, and I think that caution should be heeded.  This movie vastly presents itself as a whimsical almost light-hearted morality tale for youngsters, but there are definitely a half a dozen scenes so different as to be glaringly out of place, if not downright unsuitable for young children.  For instance, in one scene the father thinks the boy is lying and begins to whip him with escalating frustration, to the point of being what in this country would definitively be called abuse.  I was so stunned by this scene that I thought for a moment that the movie must have skipped to an ""extra features"" section.  Then there is the boy stabbing his toy.  The point here is not that children never project their frustration through acting out violently.  The point here is that this movie is so predominantly a child oriented fantasy that this scene of violence is completely out of place.  There are several other scenes that fall into this category.

I like some of Steven Chow's other movie's (I'm a huge fan of Kung Fu Hustle).  And though there are many things I liked about this film, its construction seems poor compared to his previous work.  These out of place sequences disturb me enough that I am forced to rate this movie much lower than it could possibly have been.",1245196800,3,1349,4.677966101694915

3173657,5,B0017LRZ04,"Not many Americans bother to watch foreign language films, but CJ7 is a rare treasure for any age or culture.  It is a clear descendant of ET, with a touch of The Little Rascals and the Dead End Kids thrown in. Director Steven Chow (who also stars) presents a view of life seen mostly from the perspective of his son, a 10 year old. Chow plays a poor but hardworking father who struggles to keep his son in a fancy school somewhere in China.  The boy faces some tough obstacles, not the least of which is his excessive poverty which causes him to wear clothes that are strictly second rate.  His lowly financial status causes him instant conflict with a group of bullies who torment him unmercifully. Through it all he has little more than his father's exhortations to lead the clean and honest life. But the boy does have the support of one of his teachers, a Miss Yuen (Kitty Chang), who is impossibly sweet and breathtaking much along the lines of Miss Crabtree from the Little Rascals of the 1930s. She is there to be his mother surrogate. Life, however, is more demanding than what his father and Miss Yuen can counter. The class bullies plus a totally insensitive and gross male teacher combine to make him miserable.  Enter the world of a Spielberg-type fantasy. The boy's father finds a remnant of a flying saucer that when he presents it to his son, turns out to be a cute and fluffy life force, capable of matter transformation. When the boy and his new alien friend interact, the movie begins to shift from one tone to another. There are several truly funny scenes of anti-gravity machinations that defy logic.  There are several others that demand that the boy face the harsh reality of bullies who want his new friend for themselves.  There are still others that come perilously close to stark death and tragedy that seem out of place in a light comedy. Yet, I see these tonal fluctuations as an integral part of the plot which requires the boy to grow up in a hurry. He must make decisions about how to use his friend, with ""use"" being the operative word. He must watch his words and promises since words spoken in haste are often a precursor to a crunching reality. And finally, he must recenter himself as to what really counts in his life. The cute and fluffy alien is seen ultimately as no more than a key by which the boy can make some hard choices in a world that promises easy solutions when the only lasting ones are the type that you can fashion yourself out of your inner core. CJ7 is a movie that deftly balances several themes that never manage to go astray. Highly recommended.",1240185600,2,2604,4.50635593220339

WARNING: You will see lots of cockroaches during one scene and they kill several. I found this funny as it was obviously overly exaggerated as many things in the movie. Some people find killing anything disturbing whether imaginary or not. This movie may be taken literally by some teachers and adults and impair their logical thinking.

It is the little details in this movie that are surprising, funny, and touching.  Just see it, with an open mind.  Your kids have to be at least old enough to read the subtitles, and probably should be a bit older to really get the most out of the movie.  It is NOT primarily about the cute little character, CJ7.

3173667,5,B0017LRZ04,CJ7 worked for my 12 year old boy and for me.  This film is a lot of fun.,1222992000,2,73,3.0555555555555554
3173668,4,B0017LRZ04,"I purchased this with only having seen the trailer.

Having seen Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle I had no hesitation in buying this.

This movie has the same theme running through like his previous movies someone poor just trying to get by.
In this case a father just trying to all he can for his son by sending him to a private school while living in an abandoned building, and scraping by.
UFO sightings start to appear in his area, but seem like a hoax.
While rummaging through a waste dump looking for shoes or anything useful he finds a strange ball, which he presents his son.
The ball turns out to be more than what he expected and will change their life.

Do not expect to see as much crazy cgi visuals as in the previous movies, they are there but not nearly as much.
This is more of a story about a father and his son, how they love each other, fight over his school work and the father wanting only the best for his son.

It has some great moments and well worth purchasing.",1222819200,,987,4.23404255319149
3173669,5,B0017LRZ04,"CJ7 is a wonderful little family film from Stephen Chow.  Our family has been long time fans of his work.  This movie was no exception.
It is not as violent or action-oriented as his other movies, but still keeps the quirky, silly sense of humor that makes a Stephen Chow movie.
It is a darling gem of a family movie.  There are plenty of moments of hilarity, and a few sweet moments, too.
Definately worth a watch.",1222819200,4,415,4.363636363636363
3173670,2,B0017LRZ04,"While I don't always get to see the wide range of movies thanks to shoddy stores, I've always loved many of the films that come from Asia from the horror of Ringu and Ju-On to animated ones like Millennium Actress or the quirky awesomeness of the Host. So I like to check out films that most otherwise would bypass but I've heard of Stephen Chow and his films ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and ""Shaolin Soccer"" but never have actually seen them but when his new film, a family film called ""CJ7"" was out, I thought I'd check it out. Ultimately what I got was a cute and time-tested idea ruined by some bad script decisions and humor.

Ti is a hard-working man with a job at the construction site but he's so poor that he has to work extra hours just to buy an electric fan and good luck finding decent food as well. His son Dicky is enrolled into a school so he can realize his full potential if only it weren't for his ratty clothes and constant picking-on by classmates and even teachers. So when Ti brings home a ball hoping to give the kid a new, impressive toy, Dicky's surprised that it's actually an alien from outer space and the 2 become friends and help deal with their family problems.

That last part I have to admit was a little hard to write since it doesn't really do that all that much, or well. Think back to the film this got compared to: Steven Spielberg's utterly classic ""E.T"" and think how Elliot was so down and friendless that when the titular character shows up, the 2 become inseparable because the idea of friendship and love wasn't being filled in by anything else. The alien CJ7 is basically a punching bag and he becomes more something to be used than something integral and needed to the 2 men. In fact, one could make a case that they didn't even need the alien since they come to grips with problems on their own. I will admit though the alien is kind of adorable and with the head of ""Chicken Little"" and the body of those things from ""Flubber"" of all things, he almost steals the show.

As far as the comedy is concerned, it's going more for slapstick and heart. Like in most comedies with dancing cats, chipmunks, dogs etc, there's got to be the requisite dance and you know the director of ""Kung Fu Hustle"" won't end the film without at least putting in some martial arts business. But tonally it feels wrong personally and I'm not saying this is a bad movie by any means since it did have its moments and it's kind of hard not to at least crack a smile or chuckle but the feel of the movie wants to be something affecting and touching yet it feels more like comedy straight through with only some family scenes to put that part in so it's there.

I usually don't run into these kind of films a lot but this is a love it/hate it kind of film where some will love it and get it while others didn't like myself. Guess I wanted more heart in this one; I mean look, the alien literally goes #2 on the kid's hand...who doesn't have the common sense to know when he was literally crapped on. Sidenote: 2 reviews of this writing and they're both 5 stars and then there's mine; it's tough being the oddman out.",1222473600,2,3125,4.300509337860781
3173671,4,B0017LRZ04,"First off the negative reviews surrounding this title seem a little unfair.  After reading them, I suspected that this film contained something completely awful.  Such was not the case... though it does deal with themes that are a little mature I wouldn't say that this film is for the entire family and that is it's misconception.  The film is geared more towards adolecents and adults more so than children.  the film is quiky and what you would expect from Chow.  but it's humor is somewhat dark at times.  Either way, should you sit your 8 year old next to you and view the film? I would say it's probably not the best idea.  but it is worth watching for yourself.  CJ7 is quirky and sweet.",1221782400,2,694,4.496
3173672,4,B0017LRZ04,"This amusing Chinese import appeals at many levels. Dicky (the boy's name in the subtitles, at least) lives with his widowed father. The father struggles to make ends meet, while sending Dicky to the best school that he can afford, determined that Dicky will have all the chances in life that the father never had. Dicky struggles too. Poverty makes him odd kid out at school, and small size makes him an easy target for the school bullies. Almost everything more than essentials in Dicky's life comes from his father's knack for salvage - including an odd little toy ...

It would be easy to say too much about this charming movie's plot, especially if you've seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batteries-Not-Included/dp/0783232047/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">*Batteries Not Included</a>. I leave it to you to watch this self-consciously cute story unfold, all the way to the smiles-all-around ending. The movie's style seems heavy handed, by western standards. Acting and character stereotypes come across as blunt instruments, and the ""flying warriors"" idiom makes an improbable appearance in the schoolyard. A few things might grate on Western sensibilities, too, like what constitutes good parenting - although generally kid safe, a few scenes might not work for very young or very skittish children. If you can take it in its own terms and ignore a bit of saccharine, you'll find some charming fun in this one.

3173673,5,B0017LRZ04,"I like Asian films, don't get me wrong. Nearly all of them, I have, are horror movies, unfortunately. What in the world would possess me to pick up CJ7? Well, someone very dear to me asked me if I had seen it. Seeing as I hadn't, I said no. Then, they went on to tell me what it was about. A movie about a man who desperately struggles to keep his son fed, clothed, and educated despite his struggle to stay employed. When his son asks for a toy that he can't afford, he sets out to find a suitable substitute that's cheaper(i.e. that doesn't cost anything). He returns from the garbage with CJ7, who is no more than a green ball at first. When his son activates this new ball, his son discovers that his new toy is much more than a toy but a magical solution to his family's struggles. Needless to say, I still wasn't sold on it so they went and rented it out. We watched it and, I got to admit, it is one of the best Asian films I've seen in awhile.  I ended up purchasing it for my very own. It is one of the most hilarious, imaginative, and smart films to come out in quite a long time. Definitely one I'd recommend for families to watch.

However, be forwarned-parents, there are a few scenes that you might want to see first before letting your kids watch that involve..um, how can we say this...poo. They're not that offensive, mind you. In fact, they are downright funny. Yet, in all fairness, you might want to scope the scenes out before letting them watch. Chow's movies, as you may have seen before with Kung Fu Hustle, are not immediately for everyone.

DVD features include: ""The Story of CJ7 "" - A behind the scenes look at the making of the film, Anatomy of a Scene"" - an in-depth look at how a scene with the adorable ""CJ7"" was shot, ""How to Bully a Bully"" - A lesson on how to stand your own ground against the school bully, ""Make Your Own Giant Lollipop"" - A how-to on making your very own lollipop prop,""The Making of CJ7"" International Television Special - A more technical behind the scenes look at the making of the film and visual effects, CJ7 Mission Control Game - See how far you can launch ""CJ7"" into space!, CJ7 Profiles - Learn more about your favorite CJ7 characters!, and Cast and Crew commentary.

CJ7 is, literally, the star of the movie. He's Asian's version of ET. Again, I highly recommend this movie to all. It's an endearing tale that families will love for years to come.",1220054400,37,2411,4.315673289183223
3173674,5,B0017LRZ04,"I just finished watching CJ7 (Blu-ray) And it is just another great Stephen Chow Film. It is what they say ; but the style is something else.  No complaints, only praise. Sound: Louder than you think! Picture: Demo quality! This disc is very good.",1219795200,4,247,4.613636363636363
3408020,4,B0017LRZ04,"It might sound unlikely, but ""CJ7"" is a family picture, directed by Stephen Chow who is probably best known for his two recent comedies ""Shaolin Soccer"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle."" Chinese-made ""CJ7"" is also a comedy, and a very well-made one, but if you expect the same kind of comedy Stephen Chow had done before, you might be disappointed.

First, though Stephen Chow plays an important role, his role is a supporting one in ""CJ7."" ""CJ7"" follows the story of a boy named Dicky (Xu Jiao), son of Ti (Stephen Chow), a laborer working at a construction site. The work is hard and Ti is not rich (actually, very poor), but the father spends every money he earns to send Dicky to a prestigious elementary school. But Dicky is not very happy as he is picked on by other rich kids at school.

One night Ti finds a strange green thing in the junkyard. He brings it home and gives it to his son as a present without knowing a UFO (yes, a big flying saucer) had left the thing behind. But it is a great present for the boy because Dicky finds a new friend in a new ""toy"" - CJ7 - a tiny puppy-like creature (?) which, it seems, has special powers - or maybe not.

It is hard to explain the charms of Stephen Chow's latest film. In ""CJ7"" a familiar theme of love and friendship (like ""E.T."" of course) is developed to make a heart-felt comedy through a convincing portrait of a father-and-son / son-and-creature relationship, but the plot also contains slapsticks, spoofs (from ""MI2"" to Japanese popular manga ""Doraemon""), comic fight scenes created by special effects and one toilet joke.

You may take the film as satire targeting modern fast-changing society of China, and believe me or not, ""CJ7"" is also a serious drama (or melodrama) with tearjerking moments. The film will be criticized for its storytelling, which some may call whimsical or even slack, but others may think Chow as director is only making his film subversive, avoiding the pitfalls of comedies and family pictures, especially predictability.

[THIS PARAGRAPH HAS MILD SPOILERS] Speaking of subversive, please watch the faces of the supporting actors/actresses closely and you may notice an interesting thing. Xu Jiao, who plays the boy Dicky, is really a girl (she had to have her long hair cut for the role); Han Yong Wua, Dicky's ""love interest"" is actually a male; and two bullying boys of the school, Johnny and his ""bodyguard,"" are played by Huang Lei and 23-year-old Yao Wen Xue, both females.

""CJ7"" is less like other over-the-top comedies Stephen Chow did in ""Shaolin Soccer"" and his films made in the 90s (such as ""Forbidden City Cop,"" a must for any Stephen Chow fans). In his latest film Stephen Chow takes the backseat to flesh out the characters Dicky and ""CJ7"" in particular and develop their stories. ""CJ7"" is a nice comedy, funny, and sometimes eccentric and surreal, and it also has a dramatic story driven by the characters you identify with.",1219536000,3,2921,4.6953125
3408021,4,B0017LRZ04,This is unlike his other movies but viewing it in the proper context makes it still o.k. After all it is highlighting the misery of poverty and prejudice. Parts of it made me cry but over all it made me laugh. Also its something the entire family can view together.,1219104000,,265,4.32
3408022,2,B0017LRZ04,"I like Stephen Chow's work.  Especially Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle.  (I have Kung Fu Hustle on DVD, Blu-Ray and UMD.)

I pre-ordered this DVD without seeing it first.  I wish I had seen the movie in the theater first.  It is not what I expected.  Yes, it is probably intended to be a ""family film.""  That's perfectly fine.  However, I cannot imagine sitting down and watching this with any young kids.  Unless of course it's pouring raining outside and they just watched ""Bambi"" and ""Old Yeller"" back to back.  That will prepare them for what is to come in this movie.

There is some cute stuff in the movie.  But there is also some content that might be difficult or emotional for some kids.

The brief homages to Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle and Mission: Impossible II were nice.

I never would have bought this DVD if I had seen the movie first.  I will definitely have to watch Stephen Chow's next movie before buying the DVD.

You can buy this DVD, but keep tissues nearby while watching.",1218758400,,1002,4.483333333333333

It's a family kind of movie, but that shouldn't turn you off from watching it if you think that means it won't be as good as Chow's other recent films. His great sense of humor is throughout the movie, and it even has a parody of Kung Fu Hustle in it.

It is in Chinese, and I highly recommend you don't watch it dubbed if that's an option. There's a specific gag that would probably be a lot less funny if you aren't listening to the original audio track.",1217980800,2,489,4.202127659574468
3408025,5,B0017LRZ04,"i already imported this from hong kong and it is a great transfer, actually looks better than it did at the theater i saw it at.

if you like any of stephen chow's other movies (shaolin soccer, kung foo hustle) you will like this one as well. some of the same actors, the same goofy style of acting and over the top theatrics. but this time there is an alien and a nice story. think of a chinese version of E.T. sort of. the part of the little boy in the movie is actually played by a girl and she does a great job.

do yourself a favor and at least rent it, it shouldn't be missed (besides its only 87 minutes long). when i went to the theater, there were only 6 other people in there with me. it really deserved better publicity than it got.

It takes some getting used to, however since it's a family film and on top of that, Chow doesn't really play the main character. Plus not a whole lot of kung-fu action...

Yeah the CGI effects are cheesy but all in all a light-hearted somewhat touching film. It's not a must-see Stephen Chow film but if you're looking for something to watch when you're bored - CJ7 will suffice.",1217203200,,527,4.655913978494624

One of my nephews was 4 and one of the nieces 3 and they couldn't get by in a day without it. Their older sister asked me a couple of months ago about this and it prompted me to search for it and buy it for her. Even at 16 now, she loves this and it's a great memory for her. So I surprised her with this purchase. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.

3408135,3,B0017LRZ04,"There really isn't much Stephen Chow in 'CJ7', so don't bother watching it for his appearances. Most of the screen time is taken up following a young boy who's poor father (Chow) works very hard to send to a private school. The boy does not fit in with the affluent and aggressive students, and his problems become complicated by the arrival of an alien pet his father finds in the dump.

Fans of Chow's films may greatly enjoy the scenes where the young boy dreams of the miraculous things his new pet might accomplish for him at his school. One of these scenes features a hilarious homage to 'Kung Fu Hustle' that was worth the price of the movie for me, but which would be lost on someone unfamiliar with that film.

Overall: the plot is painfully predictable, the peril the alien pet is placed in is too intense for very young viewers, the romantic sub-plot is underdeveloped, and there is just too little Stephen Chow.

3408144,4,B0017LRZ04,"Youngsters will get a real kick out of ""CJ7,"" a delightful sci-fi comedy from China that should satisfy any child's requirements for a wish-fulfillment fantasy.

Dicky is a grade school boy who lives in an abandoned, dilapidated and roach-infested building with his father, an uneducated laborer who works construction jobs during the day so he can afford to send his boy to a posh private school, and then scavenges the local dumpsites for throw-away items (worn-out shoes, a busted fan) at night.  Due to his low class upbringing and background, as reflected in his unkempt mien and disheveled appearance, Dicky has become a constant target of bullying and ridicule at school - until, that is, he comes into possession of a mysterious ""toy,"" or possibly an alien from outer space, that gives the lad the ability to perform feats of astonishing physical and mental dexterity, to the great amazement and amusement of his fellow students.  Yet, could this little creature (whom Dicky dubs CJ7, after a similar toy made here on earth) wind up causing the boy more trouble than it saves him in the long run?

Although the sci-fi aspects can become a bit cutesy and cheesy at times, the real strength of the film lies in its beautifully observed relationship between a down-on-his-luck father who's doing all he can to instill the values of hard work and honesty into his boy, and a son who'd rather spend his time devising ways to get out of doing his schoolwork so he can spend all his time playing with his new-found friend from outer space.  It's that father/son relationship that keeps the story grounded in reality and that gives plausibility and weight to the more fantastical elements of the tale.  Xu Jiao (who is actually a girl in real life) and Stephen Chow (who also co-wrote and directed the film) are utterly charming, winning and appealing as Dicky and his dad, respectively, and they are matched by a whole host of wonderful supporting players, both of the full-sized and the pint-sized variety.

Like all good stories aimed at kids, ""CJ7"" is just chock-full of rock-solid values like tolerance, acceptance, discipline and hard work, yet it never feels the need to preach or talk down to its audience.  Instead, the values filter their way through a well-told story - which, of course, is as it should be.

Sentimental in the best sense of that term - with a hint of ""The Kid"" here, a touch of ""E.T."" there - ""CJ7"" provides near-perfect entertainment for the young, as well as those still young enough to remember what it was like to be young.",1281398400,,2556,4.777777777777778

3408149,5,B0017LRZ04,"I don't normally write reviews, but I was shocked by the few (and I do mean few) negative reviews of this film. It inspired me to write a positive review, if for no other reason than to give this film its worth.

I'll say from the start that I am biased. I have seen a number of Stephen Chow's films (including the boring Justic Is My Foot). I am a fan. I find his humor a combination of wit and slapstick. There is a strong level of intelligence and appreciatiation for the absurd (think Looney Tunes).

While Stephen Chow is known for his slapstick adult humor, it was less surprising to me that HE had made a childrens' film than to hear that Takashi Miike had made a children's film (""The Great Yokai War""). None the less, I was skeptical. Could Stephen Chow transcend the greatest folly of childrens' films? The greatest folly is, of course, the over-simplifying of the world to a point where it has no relevance in reality, except as a delusional acid trip. Adults of all kinds tend to fall into the chasm of under-estimation. They all think that children can not handle the real world. While I agree that some things are worth waiting to tell a child until she/he has matured, other things, being natural to life and the human condition, should be confronted in a respectful and meaningful fashion. This film does that.

This film does not skirt around the consequences of one's actions. This film faces them bold-facedly. *SPOILER* Even though the film has a happy family ending, it does not pretend that jealousy does not happen; that rage does not motivate actions; that death does not exist. The normal kids' emotions are not just explored but dealt with as if Stephen Chow were writing about his kids.

This film is a testament to what kids films should be like.
I give this film the highest rating!!

3408152,2,B0017LRZ04,"I appreciate other reviewers here cautioning us as to the content of this movie, and I think that caution should be heeded.  This movie vastly presents itself as a whimsical almost light-hearted morality tale for youngsters, but there are definitely a half a dozen scenes so different as to be glaringly out of place, if not downright unsuitable for young children.  For instance, in one scene the father thinks the boy is lying and begins to whip him with escalating frustration, to the point of being what in this country would definitively be called abuse.  I was so stunned by this scene that I thought for a moment that the movie must have skipped to an ""extra features"" section.  Then there is the boy stabbing his toy.  The point here is not that children never project their frustration through acting out violently.  The point here is that this movie is so predominantly a child oriented fantasy that this scene of violence is completely out of place.  There are several other scenes that fall into this category.

I like some of Steven Chow's other movie's (I'm a huge fan of Kung Fu Hustle).  And though there are many things I liked about this film, its construction seems poor compared to his previous work.  These out of place sequences disturb me enough that I am forced to rate this movie much lower than it could possibly have been.",1245196800,3,1349,4.677966101694915

3408154,5,B0017LRZ04,"Not many Americans bother to watch foreign language films, but CJ7 is a rare treasure for any age or culture.  It is a clear descendant of ET, with a touch of The Little Rascals and the Dead End Kids thrown in. Director Steven Chow (who also stars) presents a view of life seen mostly from the perspective of his son, a 10 year old. Chow plays a poor but hardworking father who struggles to keep his son in a fancy school somewhere in China.  The boy faces some tough obstacles, not the least of which is his excessive poverty which causes him to wear clothes that are strictly second rate.  His lowly financial status causes him instant conflict with a group of bullies who torment him unmercifully. Through it all he has little more than his father's exhortations to lead the clean and honest life. But the boy does have the support of one of his teachers, a Miss Yuen (Kitty Chang), who is impossibly sweet and breathtaking much along the lines of Miss Crabtree from the Little Rascals of the 1930s. She is there to be his mother surrogate. Life, however, is more demanding than what his father and Miss Yuen can counter. The class bullies plus a totally insensitive and gross male teacher combine to make him miserable.  Enter the world of a Spielberg-type fantasy. The boy's father finds a remnant of a flying saucer that when he presents it to his son, turns out to be a cute and fluffy life force, capable of matter transformation. When the boy and his new alien friend interact, the movie begins to shift from one tone to another. There are several truly funny scenes of anti-gravity machinations that defy logic.  There are several others that demand that the boy face the harsh reality of bullies who want his new friend for themselves.  There are still others that come perilously close to stark death and tragedy that seem out of place in a light comedy. Yet, I see these tonal fluctuations as an integral part of the plot which requires the boy to grow up in a hurry. He must make decisions about how to use his friend, with ""use"" being the operative word. He must watch his words and promises since words spoken in haste are often a precursor to a crunching reality. And finally, he must recenter himself as to what really counts in his life. The cute and fluffy alien is seen ultimately as no more than a key by which the boy can make some hard choices in a world that promises easy solutions when the only lasting ones are the type that you can fashion yourself out of your inner core. CJ7 is a movie that deftly balances several themes that never manage to go astray. Highly recommended.",1240185600,2,2604,4.50635593220339

It's great for pretty much all ages.

A coolie construction worker finds an unusual toy ball at the dump and brings it home to placate his son for not getting him a CJ1 robotic dog. It turns out it is much more than a ball and although all his dreams don't come true, he learns a valuable lesson about getting along with others.

WARNING: You will see lots of cockroaches during one scene and they kill several. I found this funny as it was obviously overly exaggerated as many things in the movie. Some people find killing anything disturbing whether imaginary or not. This movie may be taken literally by some teachers and adults and impair their logical thinking. They may become incoherent in blathering attempts to critique it. Do not watch this movie if you hate comedies, poking fun at the poor, the rich, bullies, large students, and strict teachers.

3408157,3,B0017LRZ04,I found this to be an entertaining movie but not one of Chow's best. There were many references to Kung Fu Hustle as well as Shaolin Soccer which were funny but overall the story was lacking. It's a fun movie but not the greatest.

There is a great moral underlying this movie and we forget sometimes that there are a lot of people in this world that are just getting by and are trying to make sure their kids have just enough.  The love of a parent and their kid is so well portrayed in this movie and the lesson learnt by the child sure bought the tears out.  Enough said, rent it, borrow it, buy it - you are sure to have a 87 minutes of laugther, tears and reflective moments.  A very heart warming movie for all ages.  Even the extra material on the making of the movie is worth watching!!

My kids were a little put off by the notion of subtitles, but that concern was gone within the first 90 seconds of the movie.  I went into the movie with no preconceptions (never heard of Stephen Chow) and was pleasantly surprised by the movie.  I laughed so hard I cried, and I just plain cried.  It is the little details in this movie that are surprising, funny, and touching.  Just see it, with an open mind.  Your kids have to be at least old enough to read the subtitles, and probably should be a bit older to really get the most out of the movie.  It is NOT primarily about the cute little character, CJ7.  It is more about the relationships between Dicky and his father and classmates, and how they are affected by what happens after CJ7 arrives.

3408165,4,B0017LRZ04,"I purchased this with only having seen the trailer.

Having seen Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle I had no hesitation in buying this.

This movie has the same theme running through like his previous movies someone poor just trying to get by.
In this case a father just trying to all he can for his son by sending him to a private school while living in an abandoned building, and scraping by.
UFO sightings start to appear in his area, but seem like a hoax.
While rummaging through a waste dump looking for shoes or anything useful he finds a strange ball, which he presents his son.
The ball turns out to be more than what he expected and will change their life.

Do not expect to see as much crazy cgi visuals as in the previous movies, they are there but not nearly as much.
This is more of a story about a father and his son, how they love each other, fight over his school work and the father wanting only the best for his son.

It has some great moments and well worth purchasing.",1222819200,,987,4.23404255319149

It is not as violent or action-oriented as his other movies, but still keeps the quirky, silly sense of humor that makes a Stephen Chow movie.
It is a darling gem of a family movie.  There are plenty of moments of hilarity, and a few sweet moments, too.
Definately worth a watch.",1222819200,4,415,4.363636363636363
3408167,2,B0017LRZ04,"While I don't always get to see the wide range of movies thanks to shoddy stores, I've always loved many of the films that come from Asia from the horror of Ringu and Ju-On to animated ones like Millennium Actress or the quirky awesomeness of the Host. So I like to check out films that most otherwise would bypass but I've heard of Stephen Chow and his films ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and ""Shaolin Soccer"" but never have actually seen them but when his new film, a family film called ""CJ7"" was out, I thought I'd check it out. Ultimately what I got was a cute and time-tested idea ruined by some bad script decisions and humor.

Ti is a hard-working man with a job at the construction site but he's so poor that he has to work extra hours just to buy an electric fan and good luck finding decent food as well. His son Dicky is enrolled into a school so he can realize his full potential if only it weren't for his ratty clothes and constant picking-on by classmates and even teachers. So when Ti brings home a ball hoping to give the kid a new, impressive toy, Dicky's surprised that it's actually an alien from outer space and the 2 become friends and help deal with their family problems.

That last part I have to admit was a little hard to write since it doesn't really do that all that much, or well. Think back to the film this got compared to: Steven Spielberg's utterly classic ""E.T"" and think how Elliot was so down and friendless that when the titular character shows up, the 2 become inseparable because the idea of friendship and love wasn't being filled in by anything else. The alien CJ7 is basically a punching bag and he becomes more something to be used than something integral and needed to the 2 men. In fact, one could make a case that they didn't even need the alien since they come to grips with problems on their own. I will admit though the alien is kind of adorable and with the head of ""Chicken Little"" and the body of those things from ""Flubber"" of all things, he almost steals the show.

As far as the comedy is concerned, it's going more for slapstick and heart. Like in most comedies with dancing cats, chipmunks, dogs etc, there's got to be the requisite dance and you know the director of ""Kung Fu Hustle"" won't end the film without at least putting in some martial arts business. But tonally it feels wrong personally and I'm not saying this is a bad movie by any means since it did have its moments and it's kind of hard not to at least crack a smile or chuckle but the feel of the movie wants to be something affecting and touching yet it feels more like comedy straight through with only some family scenes to put that part in so it's there.

I usually don't run into these kind of films a lot but this is a love it/hate it kind of film where some will love it and get it while others didn't like myself. Guess I wanted more heart in this one; I mean look, the alien literally goes #2 on the kid's hand...who doesn't have the common sense to know when he was literally crapped on. Sidenote: 2 reviews of this writing and they're both 5 stars and then there's mine; it's tough being the oddman out.",1222473600,2,3125,4.300509337860781
3408168,4,B0017LRZ04,"First off the negative reviews surrounding this title seem a little unfair.  After reading them, I suspected that this film contained something completely awful.  Such was not the case... though it does deal with themes that are a little mature I wouldn't say that this film is for the entire family and that is it's misconception.  The film is geared more towards adolecents and adults more so than children.  the film is quiky and what you would expect from Chow.  but it's humor is somewhat dark at times.  Either way, should you sit your 8 year old next to you and view the film? I would say it's probably not the best idea.  but it is worth watching for yourself.  CJ7 is quirky and sweet.",1221782400,2,694,4.496
3408169,4,B0017LRZ04,"This amusing Chinese import appeals at many levels. Dicky (the boy's name in the subtitles, at least) lives with his widowed father. The father struggles to make ends meet, while sending Dicky to the best school that he can afford, determined that Dicky will have all the chances in life that the father never had. Dicky struggles too. Poverty makes him odd kid out at school, and small size makes him an easy target for the school bullies. Almost everything more than essentials in Dicky's life comes from his father's knack for salvage - including an odd little toy ...

I leave it to you to watch this self-consciously cute story unfold, all the way to the smiles-all-around ending. The movie's style seems heavy handed, by western standards. Acting and character stereotypes come across as blunt instruments, and the ""flying warriors"" idiom makes an improbable appearance in the schoolyard. A few things might grate on Western sensibilities, too, like what constitutes good parenting - although generally kid safe, a few scenes might not work for very young or very skittish children. If you can take it in its own terms and ignore a bit of saccharine, you'll find some charming fun in this one.

3408170,5,B0017LRZ04,"I like Asian films, don't get me wrong. Nearly all of them, I have, are horror movies, unfortunately. What in the world would possess me to pick up CJ7? Well, someone very dear to me asked me if I had seen it. Seeing as I hadn't, I said no. Then, they went on to tell me what it was about. A movie about a man who desperately struggles to keep his son fed, clothed, and educated despite his struggle to stay employed. When his son asks for a toy that he can't afford, he sets out to find a suitable substitute that's cheaper(i.e. that doesn't cost anything). He returns from the garbage with CJ7, who is no more than a green ball at first. When his son activates this new ball, his son discovers that his new toy is much more than a toy but a magical solution to his family's struggles. Needless to say, I still wasn't sold on it so they went and rented it out. We watched it and, I got to admit, it is one of the best Asian films I've seen in awhile.  I ended up purchasing it for my very own. It is one of the most hilarious, imaginative, and smart films to come out in quite a long time. Definitely one I'd recommend for families to watch.

However, be forwarned-parents, there are a few scenes that you might want to see first before letting your kids watch that involve..um, how can we say this...poo. They're not that offensive, mind you. In fact, they are downright funny. Yet, in all fairness, you might want to scope the scenes out before letting them watch. Chow's movies, as you may have seen before with Kung Fu Hustle, are not immediately for everyone.
