2688832,5,B000KF0WU8,You will never tire of watching this awesome series. I cannot get enough of this. I have watched it over and over many times these past 10 or so years. I was lucky enough to obtain all five seasons from the UK. Each time you watch; it is if for the first time. Hearing Diana Trent's sardonic quotes are delightful.  I cannot say enough about this show. I just wish it didn't end. I only hope one day they would come back and do a reunion. That would be a television treat of a lifetime!,1273276800,3,486,4.11578947368421
2688833,5,B000KF0WU8,"although i have seen all the different seasons of this sitcom, the fact that this season is finally being released is like a shot of adrenaline for me --- it's a great series, and especially for the baby boomers the writing hits home --- a wonderful and funny, often bittersweet experience.",1272499200,,290,4.705882352941177
2688834,5,B000KF0WU8,"The title of this show means that the characters are old and very close to the end of their lives.  However, they are having one last laugh as the get there. Everyone in this show is hilarious and you do not need to be older to enjoy it.  The two main characters definitely hold it together with the woman being the acidic of the two and the man being the soothing balm.  These are two terrific comedy partners and the supporting characters are all well picked, in all generations.  Nothing like this exists in American tv so it is especially a treat for American viewers like myself. Watch every season of it.  You can't go wrong.

2688835,5,B000KF0WU8,"Let the antics of aging continue!  The Bayview Retirement Home for the Almost Dead is once more the setting for the on-going activities of Tom Ballard and Diana Trent.

As I have stated in the other reviews of this series, ""WAITING FOR GOD"" was done on an overall story arc.  We've had the beginning, the middle, and now here comes the end!  But what a build-up to the most hilarious climax a series ever had!  Those who thought they had seen 'everything' with the way the Newhart series ended have not seen ANYTHING yet.  The first time I saw the last episode (after almost killing my ribcage laughing) I was a bit saddened to realize that there were no more.  However they ended on what can only be called a 'high point.' The series finale is priceless!

Thankfully, the missing Christmas special included at the end of Season Four solved the continuity problem of how we lost Basil Makepeace (played by the late Michael Bilton) and acquired Jane's grandfather Jamie.  Mr. Bilton passed away and they brought in the new character to keep the balance.  That episode (Diana directing a Christmas pagent?) was never shown in the US to my knowledge.

In this, the completion of the story line, the action continues.  Highlights (I give no details - why spoil the fun?)include: health problems, breakups, breakdowns, fights with city hall, Jane decides to become a nun (again), Harvey becomes a clergyman, and Tom decides that he and Diana should marry.  The series finale has to be the funniest 25 minutes of television, even surpassing ""Scandal"" (the infamous 'bedroom episode in the third season of this series).  It's could be called 'two weddigs and a funeral' but someone else had that title first.  No matter.  It's great fun, and worth the LONG wait.

NOTE:  FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T 'VISITED' BAYVIEW, START AT THE BEGINNING WITH SEASON ONE.  PLEASE DON'T START WITH SEASON FIVE!  The story won't make as much sense if you jump in at the middle, and if you see the end before the beginning, you are cheating yourself out of the joy of watching the characters get to know one another!

I have my set on pre-order. When I saw it was available, I heaved a sigh of relief that we will own the whole series.  They will be put in a place of honour. We wore out the video tapes a long time ago.  These are the shows you can watch over & over.  We certainly do - and we STILL laugh out loud!",1265673600,30,2386,4.546948356807512

2688866,5,B000KF0WU8,"Janine Duvitski is one of the finest Britcom actresses in recent years, a talent that is, in my mind, underrated.  She is best known as the Harvey Bains-lovestruck Jane Edwards, who worships the ground Harvey - a complete douchebag who is prone to calling Jane every name in the book, simply for loving him - walks on, little knowing that Geoffrey Ballard - the son of eccentric Bayview resident Tom Ballard, who has moved on from his late wife after falling in love with the snarky Diana Trent - is the man who actually loves her.  However, Geoffrey is saddled with 2 bratty children, Tarquin and Skye, and his wife Marion, a pill-head who may very well be the biggest whore in Bournemouth.  And although he's left Marion multiple times, it is in the final season where Geoffrey begins to make his feelings known to Jane.  However, Jane ended up rejecting Geoffrey because he is married, and because he punched Harvey - who has had past dalliances with Marion - in the face.  And sadly, in the end,  Jane married Harvey when, in my mind, he pretended to love her so he could advance his social standing.  And therein lies the question.

Did Jane really win out?

I'm not Michael Aitchens, but if I were a writer on this wonderful series, WAITING FOR GOD could have had a different ending.  For one, Jane would NOT have settled for Harvey.  After deciding that she deserved better, rather than playing a game of nunnery, she could have developed a nice friendship with Geoffrey as he began divorce proceedings.  But they would not have started dating until after his divorce, because they both have deep moral convictions.  And as it would play out, Harvey would be on the losing end - especially if it led to Jane marrying Geoffrey instead of him.

Just my 2 cents.",1403827200,,1766,4.600638977635783
2688867,5,B000KF0WU8,"This whole ""Waiting for God"" show is a winner! Finally a show not about young people doing stupid physical comedy with near profane inferential ""jokes"" including ridiculous ""political correctness.""

Tom and Diana, in the first series (season in the US) meet when they are involuntarily retired by England's retirement system to Bayview, an apartment complex for the elderly. As Diana says, a home for the ""nearly dead.""

Harvey and Jane, the duo who run the place are romantic, comic opposites while they try to oust Tom and Diana who see the ""economical"" way the older people are treated. In this last segment, marriage is at hand - but you have to see it for yourself! (No spoiler!)

England's often soft-spoken humour doesn't find too much of a place here. The sometimes foul-mouthed ""wrinklies"" eloquently tell their ""captors""exactly where they can get off - and make sure they do as these oldies fight to stop their rights and privileges from being ""reasoned away."" Tom and Diana arethe heroes of this ""oldies comedy."" The late Graham Crowden and the very-much alive (2014) Stephanie Cole are experts in their craft.

If you like in-your-face ""Britcoms,"" this is a ""don't miss.""",1402790400,,1183,4.98984771573604

2688870,5,B000KF0WU8,"This is a British sitcom about two older people who find themselves living in a retirement home and are not happy about it. Diana and Tom do not grow old with complacency. With determination, humor and Diana's balls, they manage to stir things up at Bay View Retirement Home, and keep the director of the home, Harvey Baines, in line. They crusade for the aging and make sure that their collective rights are not violated. Its a very witty show and its enlightening to see two older people create a fulfilling life for themselves after having been thrown into a living circumstance (put in the home) that they didn't want. Stephanie Cole, who plays Diana Trent, was  recognized by the Queen and awarded for her work in advocating for the elderly through this role.",1395532800,,764,4.701492537313433

But, over time, as I get enough money, I will pick out the rest of the Seasons one by one. And, there's not much advantage costwise in buying in bulk.

2688875,5,B000KF0WU8,"As an 80-year-old I'm prejudiced -- I know these people! I have loved living all 5 seasons with them and sharing their geriatric ailments and their schemes to keep from being ""managed"". All you kids (under 60) should definitely buy the whole series, watch it now, and watch it again at intervals. The older you get the harder you will laugh at it even as you go through the physical pains and weirdies of aging with Diana and Tom and all the other denizens of Bayview. Five seasons was exactly the right timing for the series -- long enough to develop the characters and situation but not too long for it to get tedious.

I love Diana and I've always said I want to be her when I grow up. Curmudgeons have the most fun and Diana certainly demonstrates that, with Tom as her perfect backup. But don't ever misjudge or underestimate Tom -- he has his own strength and is never overshadowed by Diana. Other characters, all colorful and some crazy, revolve around Tom and Diana and get involved in their causes and wars against the Bayview management. The actors who portray them are some of the best you'll see anywhere.

Although I rate the entire series with 5 stars, I almost held back a star on Season 5: there were several things I thought did not work as well as they should have. Jeffrey's temporary transformation into a biker was overdone; Harvey's short stint as a ""minister"" was unnecessary and silly; and a new character, Jane's grandfather. although pleasant, didn't really add that much to the season. But all of our friends were in their usual rare form and the ending!....this has to be the funniest finale in all of TV-land! Yes, there is a wedding, but you have never been to a wedding like this one!

So goodbye, Diana, Tom, Harvey, Jane and all the rest -- you can go on forever on our DVDs and we will enjoy coming back to visit you as we age too, and need plenty of laughs to see us through that most peculiar part of our lives.",1346716800,,1947,4.448179271708684

2688879,1,B000KF0WU8,"Although I love this series, and in fact, it is the first one that I have ever felt compelled to purchase; my disappointment lies in the fact that I cannot watch it!  Apparently, because it came from England it does not work on my DVD player. My main problem is with you, Amazon.  It seems that you would warn a customer (and I have been a very loyal customer) of the possibility that a DVD purchased from England would not work!! Why would you offer it for sale to American customers? Now I must deal with the English bookseller and I have very little hope of getting my money back.

2688881,5,B000KF0WU8,"My husband and I, who were 51 when we first saw this series  on our PBS station, thoroughly enjoyed it, even though we then saw retirement as far in our futures.  We've probably watched the entire series at least three more times, relating to it slightly differently each time.  Now we are 72, discovering, as do slightly addled Tom Ballard (Graham Crowden) and bossy Diana Trent (Stephanie Cole), that getting old isn't for sissies. Though we are now retired, we laugh out loud at many of the characters' behaviors and adventures.  The entire cast seems perfect; we cannot imagine any other actors in any of the roles.  Tom's son and daughter-in-law make a dysfunctional marriage into a laughing matter, and even Jane's unrequited love for Harvey Bains is cause for sympathetic merriment.  This is a wonderful and accurate series, probably totally unique in its focus on the elderly when it was made.  Important sociological issues are explored in a humorous way, even though no one who sees this show will volunteer to live in a ""retirement village.""",1296691200,,1052,4.909604519774011
