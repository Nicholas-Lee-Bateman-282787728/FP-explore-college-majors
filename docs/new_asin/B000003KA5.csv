7903026,3,B000003KA5,"I enjoyed this episode of Voyager, but if I have one criticism, it is that I would have liked for the writers to have used this episode to better aquaint us with the character of B'Elanna Torres.  Unfortunately however, I didn't learn anything new about Torres through this episode - it was just ""more of the same"".  Torres is smart.  Torres is competent.  Torres is stubborn.  Torres has a temper.  Okay...I get it!  Now let's get below the surface!
The best thing about this episode, in my opinion, is that it provides a ""textbook case"" of why the Prime Directive is so necessary.  Torres learns this the hard way in ""Prototype"".  Turns out, Janeway is much wiser than Torres originally thought!",995587200,,697,4.694214876033058
7903027,4,B000003KA5,"I don't know why, but there's just something a bit cute about these ""automated units"".
They're the most polite androids you'll ever see in this Star Trek episode or *ANY* episode...
It's pretty shocking to find out that these ""automated units"" are evil.
I like the design on them too. And the display you see at the beginning of the episode is much more REALISTIC and FUTURISTIC than then ""Red display"" you see in ""Terminator I and II"".
There's something I like about these ""automated units.""",992304000,,492,4.732558139534884
