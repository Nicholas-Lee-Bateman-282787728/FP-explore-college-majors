8065440,3,B0009Q0FDM,"If (like me) you're a fan of B&W mad scientist/disembodied head movies, then this DVD from the Vintage Classic Movies series is the triple feature for you. The movies--dating back to 1959 through 1962--are all widely known and available elsewhere, so I won't bother reviewing them individually. The prints are decent (better than most Alpha Video but not as good as Midnite Movies) and clocking in at just over four hours (251 minutes), this one disc provides an entire afternoon of B-movie entertainment.",1372636800,,505,5.096385542168675
