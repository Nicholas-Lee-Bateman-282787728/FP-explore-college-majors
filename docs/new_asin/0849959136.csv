7793140,5,0849959136,i really liked this movie i ordered it at amazon and watched it yesterday. Great plot about kids at summer bible camp. Loved gregg russell in it. Good morals and i think good for any age. My only complaint is the quality of the tape at times it got an orange tint and the picture jumped at times but it didn't effect real bad cuz it is a really good movie,1466899200,,355,4.014084507042254
