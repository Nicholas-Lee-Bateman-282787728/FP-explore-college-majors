I like the movie and Helen Mirren is a favorite, but unfortunately, while the tape plays fine I cannot transfer it to my DVD machine. Since this is where I now watch nearly all of my recorded movies, it's a real pain. That maddening DRM crap. I wouldn't mind buying a second copy on DVD but for some reason, perhaps  legal rights issues, I cannot find it on a Region 1 disc. Someday, maybe. Sigh.",1385596800,,469,4.269662921348314

I'm glad it expressed appreciation for something as meaningful as Gorbachev's efforts, and gave some fine performers the chance to do that.",1321228800,,290,4.705882352941177
