1200340,1,B00000F0M6,"I'm a part-time yoga practitioner of 15 years, and this is my first BAD yoga experience to date. Mark's monotone, nasal voice (perhaps trying to be sexy?) was intollerable. If you're insitent, I'll sell you my tape, since I  never got around to returning it!",945043200,9,258,4.733333333333333
1200341,5,B00000F0M6,"After being bored by too many slow, cheesy yoga tapes that were more meditation than workout, Mark Blanchard's power yoga was just what I was looking for.  It's challenging and will make you sweat, like  ""power"" yoga should.  It may be tough for a complete beginner,  but for anyone with any familiarity with power yoga, I recommend this  workout for days as an alternative to the gym.  You feel so calm &  energized after this yoga, soon you won't want to go to the gym anymore!",944697600,9,479,4.5
7906291,2,B00000F0M6,"As a seasoned yoga teacher, I was impressed by Mark's sequencing and attention to details in the poses.  I thought his knowledge and breadth of the material presented was excellent. However, I agree with many of the other reviews posted that this guy has serious narcissistic ego issues.  He uses a lot of negative prompts with the class members (words like ""don't,"" ""stop,"" and ""no"") and his tone of voice sounds like an angry Darth Varder disciplining or getting after the class for not being as picture perfect as him.  Yoga is supposed to be an egoless place stemming from compassion for yourself and others. He reminded me a lot of the Harry Potter Book 2 character Gilderoy Lockhart.  I would rate this video as a 5 star in instruction but a 1 star in incredibly arrogant teacher personality.",1295568000,,798,4.719424460431655
7906292,5,B00000F0M6,"I came to amazon.com specifically to search for this video that I used to practice regularly in the 90's.  I love this video because it is totally challenging and even Mark says over and over how yoga is a practice, and he makes you feel comfortable about not getting the poses totally right.  It has been over ten years... closer to fifteen years since I have seen this video.  I too get board with other workouts, and am not the type of person that enjoys leaving my house and going to the gym just to get a good work out.  The most important thing to me is to get a good workout and a lot of sweating, and this video will do that for me in the first 15-30 minutes.  No jumping around or expensive workout clothes required.  I love this video!",1278460800,,745,4.211267605633803
7906293,4,B00000F0M6,"Do you ever get the feeling that some people will never ""get"" yoga no matter how many different ways they come at it? I read these reviews and had to comment. I think that if you are doing the tapes, Mark's voice did not impact my two years of using this tape whatsoever. My body changed by using his first three tapes and my wife and I really love them. His next series, Progressive Power Yoga gets it even better, but these first tapes are still an outstanding workout. Mark kicks your butt and makes you like it. It is fun, intense, centering and my stress is way down. I suggest you don't take my word for it, don't take the other reviewer's word for it, make up your mind for yourself. Mark jokes about buying people a gym membership if they do not believe his workout does more for their body than the gym... I wonder if he ever had to make good on that challenge? We had stopped doing yoga for a few months and when I saw him ranked number one in Fitness magazine, I went to Amazon to see if I could replace a few worn out tapes. Read the reviews and had to add a few of my own. I think if you are even remotely adventurous, you should try this guy. He is the best workout my wife and I have ever done!!!",1076284800,4,1211,4.071129707112971
7906294,2,B00000F0M6,"Mark Blanchard is incredibly flexible and strong, and watching him do some positions can be motivating. His voice, however, is not. I can tune out irritations and get past most things, but I found I couldn't get past his voice and emotion. Yoga is a sport best taught in a moderate, soothing, even-toned voice to not interrupt your concentration and meditation. I wished that I could turn off the sound and just follow the tape, but then I wouldn't have had a flowing workout. I have concerns with the opening warm up as it is too strenuous for the average person's lower back and as a devotee to health and fitness, is not a move I would recommend. The repetition of it is likely to strain people's backs and cause injury. Once you get past that, the rest of the tape is a good workout and when you get to the Sun Salute flow, you will be tested and your muscles will scream. I would recommend looking for tapes with Rodney Yee or by Yoga Zone before this one.",1047513600,4,961,4.374301675977653
7906295,3,B00000F0M6,"I've had this video now for over three months and upon my further investigation of what true, authentic yoga is, this video exemplifies what it is not. The video IS demonstrative, not instructional. You really need an instructor to do this practice with effectiveness and wisdom. It is not for beginners.
Yes, (ashtanga/power) yoga will make you fit, but its more subtle than that. It's an internal practice, and being fit is a by-product. It's not about how you should look like; it's about getting in touch with your authentic self. This power yoga video is just one of the many examples of the current over-emphasis of the physicality of yoga.
The practice is a process of becoming sensitized to your body as well as being strengthened, in body, mind, and spirit. But it's hard to reach that centred, meditative, focused state when Mark Blanchard is talking, and subjectively speaking, he just seems to talk too much at times. He doesn't help facilitate the inner quiet and focused intensity one aims for in a practice (in this video anyway). There's even a point when he yells ""HOW FAR CAN YOU TAKE IT!?!?!"". If I heard my instructor say something like that, I'd want my money back. When you're in a particularly challenging or intense asana, the last thing you want to hear is someone yelling at you. You want a calm, balanced voice like Rodney Yee, Baron Baptiste, Patricia Walden, John Scott, or David Swenson. You want quiet in order to focus and listen to your body.
Four important principles particular to power or ashtanga yoga that are completely left out in the video are Ujjayi Pranayama (correct breathing), bhandas (internal body locks), dristes (gazing point), and vinyasa (the linking of asanas, or postures). It's important to know them if you want the real thing.
In addition, if you're interested in authentic Ashtanga yoga, which is where power yoga is derived from, be sure that the instructor has studied under Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, who is the contemporary source of it all, for example David Swenson's books or videos, or John Scott's new DVD. Another highly recommended instructor is Erich Schiffman, author of Yoga: The Spirit & Practice of Moving into Stillness. There is a depth to their teachings that I don't see in Mark Blanchard's instruction, even though he apparently studied under K. Pattabhi Jois in the past.
Practice with this video often and you'll be listening more to Mark Blanchard than to your own body.",1042588800,12,2447,4.870503597122302
7906296,4,B00000F0M6,"I you have been reading some of the other reviews I found the overall criticisms of Mark Blanchard to be exaggerated. His voice is not annoying. He is a very adept Yoga practioner and his is clear to state the fundamental reason for yoga is to better understand and become intune with your own body. The added benefit of yoga is a killer body. I do want to say that this is not the traditional practice of what is known as the more athletic yoga, Ashtanga. I do practice Ashtanga and while he takes some poses from the discipline, most are not. However,the workout is great, you will sweat and you will be sore. This tape is difficult for those new to any yoga practice but not impossible. Like anything new, time is needed to adjust. I also found it interesting that while doing a stretch in the video, he left the scene of him falling out of the pose. This is to emphasize that though he has been practicing for many years, he is still growing and the newcomer should not feel daunted by the practice if they cannot do every move. My boyfriend and I enjoy his tape and feel limber and rejuvenated after viewing it.",1014336000,6,1116,4.3701923076923075
7906297,5,B00000F0M6,"I have to chuckle a bit as I write this, thinking of the reviews that have preceeded me.  I could give a quick summary upfront and say - read the five star reviews after this one. Awesome! You've heard of the 'picture goalboard'? Anyone who has done this, knows the power.  What better 'picture' than Mark and his entire class showing Power Yoga. Why spend hundreds of dollars for weight training until you can at least lift your leg!
I was in search of something beyond my kindergarten teacher talking nice-nice as she was 'instructing' me how to left my left leg over my right! I was in search of an 'ultimate' and I found it! I was also looking for something beyond 'a Tibetan monk' something with more action and most important a 'role model' to emulate. I needed a five year goal with a tape that I wouldn't have command of in three viewings. The title says it all - Power Yoga. So if you need somebody to hold your hand and you're not a self-sufficient individual, this video is not for you.  But if you are...WOW! are you in for a treat and a challenge.  Need I say more?",1004918400,4,1078,4.321782178217822
7906298,1,B00000F0M6,"I did not like this video at all. I have taken yoga for a long time with lots of  different teachers and styles. And yes the rasping voice is unbearable and it's just trying to cover for the absence of any quality  instruction in the poses. If you like Bryan Kest's tapes, this is more of  the same. Where Bryan Kest gets by on his good looks Mark Blanchard gets by  on his prodigious yogic abilities. Still that does not mean that he has  anything to teach. And if you think that by simply watching someone do a  handstand and bring his feet to touch the top of his head, you will learn  how to get there, you might be disappointed. It is true however: You will  sweat and you will lose weight. This tape truly has it's place next to your  complete Tae Bo Video set.",963792000,12,767,4.163265306122449
7906299,5,B00000F0M6,"What other type of workout video do you need if you own ""The Power Within""? I grew tired of aerobics and step workouts. With this video, there is no need to jump about to get the cardiovascular benefits. As a  yoga beginner, I did find the workout VERY challenging, but that is what an  exercise video should be, so you never outgrow it. A beautiful sense of  calm follows every session, and Mark Blanchard reminds you throughout the  video that it is not about competing or completng poses, but it is about  challenging yourself every time and reaching a new plateau. I will NEVER go  back to aerobics!",948585600,9,603,4.537037037037037
