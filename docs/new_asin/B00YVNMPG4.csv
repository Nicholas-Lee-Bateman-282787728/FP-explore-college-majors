8719278,5,B00YVNMPG4,"The Featured Guest Series is brand new and has had some truly great features so far. This volume includes three shows featuring David Letterman as a guest, including Letterman's first appearance (1978). The other two shows include one from August, 1991 (my favorite), right after Johnny Carson and David Letterman learned that Letterman would not be taking over ""The Tonight Show"". The third show on the DVD is Letterman's last appearance in the last week of ""The Tonight Show"". Nice memories.",1433894400,,493,5.098765432098766
