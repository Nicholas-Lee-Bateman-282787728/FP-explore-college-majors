2698300,5,B000KWZ1XO,"Our two girls, ages 3 1/2 and 1yr LOVE Noddy and when we saw this video, we had to buy it.  It came within a week and they love the video.  I like that there are extras like the music video and ""say it with noddy"".  The one lacking thing is the Noddy Theme Song.  I wish it was on here, but we'll live without it.  A good value.",1173744000,,328,3.6956521739130435
2698301,3,B000KWZ1XO,"The title alone is misleading.  I believed that this was a movie and not just some of the Tv stories.

As for Noddy, the children still enjoy it!

Being so simple, the book is not as simple to read to the child, and a little one losses interest fast.  I enjoyed it more.",1173312000,,270,4.037735849056604
8159376,5,B000KWZ1XO,"My twin toddler boys love Noddy ! It's the only animated character that holds their attention long enough for me to do something. I accidentally bought a Make Way for Noddy, DVD about two years ago, tried it, and now I try to find everything dealing with him. They love Noddy and the friends in Toytown !",1428537600,,304,4.350877192982456
8159377,5,B000KWZ1XO,So happy that I found this DVD on Amazon. I watched Noddy in England back on the day and wanted to turn my daughter onto this wonderful show which she  watched  on PBS almost every day and then they took it off the air in our area. I was thrilled to find the dvd and buy it for her....this one is her all time favorite and I love the short episodes as I try to limit her TV time.,1421107200,,379,3.7848101265822787
8159378,5,B000KWZ1XO,loved it...,1412121600,,11,5.0
8159379,5,B000KWZ1XO,The children enjoy the fun and excitement that Noddy provides with his adventures. Sparks the imagination of the viewer. Great!,1401235200,,127,5.4
8159380,5,B000KWZ1XO,"We were introduced to Noddy and Friends on the Sprout channel, which no longer airs the British show. Our then 2-yr old daughter fell in love the first time she saw it. Even our 8-month old triples (2 boys and a girl) take notice of the show when it was on the TV. We bought the set of 5 DVDs from Wal-mart, which did not include the book. The stories are ~ 10 mins long each and all are educationally based on social situations like sharing, good vs naughty behavior, cooperation, telling the truth, and even counting. The DVD sets also have a 3-4 minute segment in between each story called Say It With Noddy, during which the children are introduced to foreign languages and sounds not normally spoken in the English language. This helps with learning other languages later in life. The animation and colors are outstanding. The characters are engaging and easy for the young to identify with. We highly recommend this fun set - even the adults enjoy watching with the kids.",1278720000,,977,4.588571428571429
8159381,5,B000KWZ1XO,"Very highly recommend all Noddy books and dvd's. They teach desirable character attributes like honesty, reliability, caring, sharing, kindness, etc.",1258416000,,149,6.5
8159382,4,B000KWZ1XO,"My 3-year old loves Noddy!!!  He gets excited when I put in the DVD and he starts to dance and sing the song.  Unfortunately, the DVD does not start out like the TV show by playing the introduction song.  It goes directly into the episodes.  This is the only reason I did not give it the 5 stars.

The DVD is noted to have English and Japanese as the audio options; however, English is the only audio language.  You do have a section where a few words of multiple languages are introduced which is nice.

All in all, this is a great DVD for the young ones.",1225756800,,556,4.140186915887851
8159383,5,B000KWZ1XO,"If you are looking for something for your children...especially boys...that is fun and sweet, but holds their attention ~ these stories will do the trick!!  I love these because my children love them and they are not violent or aggressive!
So if you want to shield your children from all the crazy stuff on T.V. while you can and instill gentle behaviors......these are for you!

You will love them!",1220313600,2,399,4.768115942028985
8159384,5,B000KWZ1XO,"my little two year old loves these dvd's...i like that there isn't alot of preveiw stuff before the main feature.
the book is a huge bonus...she takes it everywhere.",1193443200,,165,4.724137931034483
8159385,4,B000KWZ1XO,"This product is region 1, and played fine on my car's DVD system. Like another reviewer, I agree - the introduction to each episode, if you recall the 30 minute episodes, is missing the full introduction song. My kids start to sing it and then cry when it cuts off. The ""Say it with Noddy"" stuff is in there too, which is great - but we're used to 30 minute episodes that end with a song, after the last ""Say it with noddy"". These don't have that either, which is another bummer, since my kids are expecting it.

Otherwise, these are episodes that we've seen on tv. It's the american version, btw, not the UK.",1176336000,,609,4.2956521739130435
