8061192,5,B0009I7D9Y,"It is clear that Henry Becker and family liked trains for in the 1930's they began a project that would result in a one mile long miniature railway on their farm. Becker Farm was located in a bucolic area in Essex County, NJ in what was then the western edge of the New York metropolitan area. Farm visitors were welcomed to the animal pens and barn and to watch the mechanized milking process. Few areas on the property were out of bounds but a farm brochure warned against petting the cows (too nervous) or walking behind a horse (reason obvious). Becker was a major milk producer and used horse-drawn wagons on some of the home delivery routes well into the 1950's!

The main attraction on the farm was the miniature railroad, built 1/6 the size of full sized trains. Completed in 1949, the little railroad was protected by automatic block signals and the trains were equipped with air brakes. No doubt Becker's prized possession was the 4-8-4 coal burning steam locomotive built in 1940. Advised during construction in Connecticut by an executive from the American Locomotive Company, one of three main builders of full sized locomotives, the 1501, its road number, closely resembled Lackawanna Railroad's ""Pocono"" passenger/fast freight locomotives and would be the railroad's main work horse until the end of operations.
This CD shows the building and operation of the railroad on the farm as well as present operations in Philipsburg, NJ. Comprised mostly of home movies shot on what appears to be 8mm film, scenes include the steam engine and train as well a the farm area. I would recommend this CD to anyone who rode the Becker Railroad or who has visited the Phillipsburg museum and wants to see how it all started. The farm and its railroad have been gone for almost four decades and fortunately some of it survives in Philipsburg. But for those of us lucky enough to have seen and ridden the little trains on the farm the memory lives on.",1257379200,2,1951,4.772189349112426
8061193,5,B0009I7D9Y,"This DVD is Great!!  I rode Becker's Train many, many weekends in the 1960's....my dad was one of the conductors on the train.  This brings back many happy memories from my early childhood.  I only wish the train was still running in the original site so I could take my kids there.  The DVD runs 60 minutes and is loaded with history and great old movie footage, as well as interviews.  This is a MUST for anyone who loved riding Becker's Train or as a gift for someone else who rode the train.",1203206400,,495,4.279569892473118
8061194,5,B0009I7D9Y,"For anyone who had the pleasure of actually riding ""Becker's Train"", this is a ""Must Have""! I was a kid in the 1950's and rode ""Becker's Train"" many, many times. It was always, without exception, a fun ride. Alas, like so many things of my youth, ""Becker's Train"" as well as the farm where it existed, is all gone now. Replaced by office buildings and houses. ""Progress"" supplanted the train but this will bring it all back for you! ENJOY!",1180224000,,439,4.5
