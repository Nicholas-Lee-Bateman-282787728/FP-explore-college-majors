8318231,5,B001LJFTHS,"After reading the negative reviews, I was expecting NOT to like this DVD.  However, since I am a self taught rookie printmaker, I decided to risk
$7.95 for this DVD.  I figured that in an 1:44 presentation there would be something I could use.  Boy, am I glad that I bought this DVD!  If you're
a beginner, trying to teach yourself MONOTYPE printmaking, this DVD is for you.  I didn't particularly like the artist style or colors, but there was
a TON of basic information on materials (inks, paints, plates, paper), preparing single and multiple plates, registration, pulling prints by hand  using the Akua pin roller.  I took lots of notes, and noted the DVD time code so that I could go back and review several issues.  I'm sure I will be
watching many parts more than once.

The best DVD that I've found",1487203200,,806,4.541666666666667

8318233,2,B001LJFTHS,The pace of this DVD is slow and plodding. It did not introduce beginners or intermediate level printmakers to unique techniques. They did not explore various printing inks by different manufacturers. They only concentrated on water soluble inks by Akua Kolor. I did not enjoy watching their processes.,1377475200,2,302,5.3125
