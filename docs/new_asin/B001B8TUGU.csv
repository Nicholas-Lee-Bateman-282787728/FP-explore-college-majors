8282304,5,B001B8TUGU,"I loved this video, and my high school ceramics classes liked it too.  What a character he was, as well as being one of the giants of ceramic art.  Of course, so much of the discussion in class centered on Pauls's choice to wear a sarong in the video and to have his toenails painted!  His tradition of making dandelion wine with his college students also got a lot of attention!  However, when the class got back to work I definitely saw a lot of life and joy in the pots that the kids were making.  The idea of ""live centering"" as opposed to ""dead center"" was absorbed and put into practice by the students.  Many of them are now taking more risks with their work.  It is rare that a film can directly inspire students in so many ways. They are still talking about it. Enjoy!",1326499200,,777,4.244897959183674
8282305,5,B001B8TUGU,"I got this DVD to listen to Paul, not to learn anything earth shattering.  What I found were his friends and admirers and Paul all talking about his art work.  Take from it what you like but I recommend this as good viewing.  What you see is what you get with this artist and it show in his work.  Rent it first if you don't believe me.",1273363200,2,336,3.970149253731343
