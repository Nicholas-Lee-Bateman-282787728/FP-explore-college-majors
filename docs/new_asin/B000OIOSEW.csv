8185177,3,B000OIOSEW,"Wow the stars are all over the map on this one. Three stars is about right. I have added a star for Emily Lloyd which is the reason I rented the film. The film has an indie feel, which would probably annoy most audiences used to a more straightforward presentation. It is sufficiently atmospheric to have made up for the compromise in production values if the plot had held together. I don't think it does. It starts out by deliberately misleading us, and then we get so confused by the motivations of several characters, that when the ""reveal"" happens we don't care and are unsure of everything we saw. Having 2 major characters talk directly to the audience seemed like a cheap band aid to clean up the plot line before the film ends. Or, maybe that's the point of the film-that you can never be sure of anything. Ultimately, the film is unconvincing. But, I was glad to get a chance to rent this hard to find movie.",1451347200,,918,4.437869822485207
8185178,1,B000OIOSEW,"Having some spare time and also $1.99 I decided to watch ""The Honeytrap."" The description of the movie was just vague enough to sound like this movie had the potential to be a good thriller. What I watched instead was a movie that never quite seemed to materialize even though the plot had legs to run on. Instead it decided to crawl.

The title of the movie refers to an often used ploy to discover if a spouse or significant other is cheating. An attractive person is hired, usually through a detective agency, to try to seduce the suspected cheater. In this case a woman named Catherine (Emily Lloyd) believes her fiance is cheating on her as he never seems to be home at night. Catherine's character is never fleshed out. In fact she's not particularly likable. She is cold and often dstant and doesn't garner sympathy as a woman who's being cheated on. She seems to have only one friend, a woman named Renee who always dresses in black. Renee says she's married, but we never see her husband. In fact Renee sames to always be going out to singles' events. Renee appears to have had a relationship in the past with Catherine's fiance, but that part of the story just never develops. One thing we do know about Catherine is that she is a woman with a troubled past.

The imagery surrounding Catherine is always bleak. Early in the film she moves into her fiance's (Jonathan) posh apartment which basically is empty. There are frequent shots of her wedding dress which is on display in the living room. However, the dress always appears to be ghostlike in appearance; empty with no substance to it, just like Catherine herself. It seems like the director was not sure how to bring all these pieces to life. In fact much of the time the viewer gets the feeling that Catherine may be having a dream.

Eventually the honeytrap is sprung and the conclusion is that her fiance is a standup guy. The two get married though we can't figure out why. At the wedding Catherine looks like she's been told that she has only a month to live. This is the point where I wish the movie had ended. However, there was still more to come. I'm not going to put in a spoiler here about how the movie ends. Thankfully I'm only out $1.99.",1360281600,,2217,4.482673267326732
8185179,4,B000OIOSEW,"Anthony Green was my neighbour from my younger years, who would have thought he would turn into such a hunk!  The film is dark but a good thriller with a twist at the end. Good acting from Anthony, not so good from Emily lloyd.",1313539200,,227,4.159090909090909
8185180,4,B000OIOSEW,"Great soundtrack and photography. London as you don't always see it. A rare recent outing of great British actress Emily Lloyd (and some other fine Brits as well). What happened to her, btw...?",1204588800,2,193,4.878787878787879
8185181,5,B000OIOSEW,"A rare performance from talented actress Emily Lloyd in this atmospheric indie. Not many DVD features, but gorgeous photography and impressive soundtrack. Wish they put a few more features on the DVD, but worth seeing for some vintage Emily Lloyd and moody London footage...",1193443200,2,274,5.25
8185182,1,B000OIOSEW,"Please be careful with this DVD.  For one, it is a DVD-R, not a silver ""pressed"" DVD.  I had trouble playing it, and it only worked in the 3rd player I tried.

Secondly, the movie is widescreen but is letterboxed in a 4:3 frame (i.e. not anamorphic) meaning that the movie only uses about half the available DVD resolution.

The company concerned is ""Filmhouse"" who must presumably be a back-room type of setup.",1193270400,2,411,4.589041095890411
