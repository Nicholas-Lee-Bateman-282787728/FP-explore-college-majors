3507546,4,B001CBFH0E,I found this to be a good strength workout.  Unfortunately for me my DVD appears to be warped and Amazon.com is unable to replace it.  Very disappointing.,1224979200,2,154,4.666666666666667
3507547,5,B001CBFH0E,"I'm new to the kettlebell craze but not to weight training.  I purchased Kettlenetics after seeing an infomercial and loved the workout and results.  The Goddess workout is only the second kettlebell routine I've tried.  It is a different type of workout than Kettlenetics and therefore I have added it to my weekly routine.  I feel sore in the right places the day after I use it.
There are several full workouts on the DVD as well as the option to create your own.  They use heavy weights.  I only use an 8 pound bell but am getting great results.  (I tried the routines with my 4 pound bell but didn't feel it was much of a challenge.)  Each workout runs about 30 minutes.  It doesn't seem like much time but the routines are intense.  You cover a lot of ground in this short time.  The prompting is good.
It is worth the price.",1222905600,49,831,4.3311688311688314

3507552,3,B001CBFH0E,"I bought these based on a friend's recommendation for Kettlebell workout.  So, I guess it's for some people.  However, this type of exercise is hard on my back.  I've never had back problems.  I am trained in kinesiology and understand proper form.  However, my back hurt once I started using this workout.  It wasn't a good kind of hurt.  Maybe I'm just not already ""in shape"" enough to use this workout.  I felt like I was going to be too out of control, drop the kettle or hit myself with it on the back of the arms too hard.  It's a very no nonsense style... but, suggested movements were going to leave bruises... maybe it's just not for me.",1387065600,3,646,4.361344537815126

It was just not good, it may be effective but I couldn't make it through to find out.  Of course this is my opinion based on the examples above.

3507557,5,B001CBFH0E,"I wanted a kettlebell workout that showed proper form and wasn't too hard, several I reviewed had you throwing the kettlebell all over the place which is fine but not what I wanted.  I read several reviews on this workout and decided even with the negative reviews I would try it. l have no complaints with this workout.  There are lots of sessions, split up to work different parts of your body.  They are short, 20 or so minutes but you really get a workout in that time.  There is no music but I like that because you should be actively breathing when lifting....it reminds you to do so.  If you want music, you can play your own.  There isn't much talking but after the exercise is explained and demonstrated, you don't need a lot of chatter.  I really like this workout and would recommend it.  As long as you aren't looking for a chatty, music filled workout, you won't be disappointed with this one!

3507563,5,B001CBFH0E,"I bought this DVD after my husband kept asking me to step-up my workouts because I wasn't getting the results I wanted.
I started to the workouts initially two times a week with one day of zumba. I eventually dumped the zumba, because I wanted to tone-up (though I still love zumba) in a faster pace. In about a month, I went from a size 16 to a small 12. I do have to recommend that you watch the tutorials if you have never received professional instruction from a Dragon Door certified trainer. Also, if you have a difficult time understanding the tutorials that come with this DVD, watch the tutorials on youtube and make sure that the trainers are certified either HKC or RKC. Cross-fit uses the kettlebell, but their style is different from the one that Dragon Door teaches their trainers. Cross-fit was founded by a former gymnast. Dragon Door was founded by a fitness guru, who earned his degrees for kinesiology, exercise science from prestigious universities, in addition to being a former ballet dancer.",1338854400,7,1014,4.734463276836158
3507564,3,B001CBFH0E,"It's an okay workout.  You will learn good technique.  However, I think too much emphasis and time is spent on warm up and cool down.  For the workouts provided, there is not enough of a workout to build up a good sweat or heart rate.  There needs to be a better balance of workout time. When the workout is complete I felt I could have done a lot more.

She does not always cue you to switch.  Some of the moves were not shown in the introduction.  You had to pick it up as you go.

I do like that you can customize to create your own workouts.

A decent beginners workout to learn kettlebell techniques.  A bit over-priced for what you get.",1335484800,,642,4.146341463414634
3507565,4,B001CBFH0E,"I'm a bit surprised by the range of reviews. Forgive me but some don't help you decide if you should buy this or not and I feel there are those individuals that think a DVD will give them instant results. I'll do my best to give you a big picture but fair review.

My background: I'm just a gal who is into WHOLE BODY wellness. I am certified in things like NLP, study hawaiian shaminism, done a few years of yoga, go to the gym and am part of the barefoot minimalist movement. And after much testing and learning about my own biology, have adopted the Paleo lifestyle. (FYI, the Dalai Lama eats meat because he fell ill decades ago. I figured if he can be flexible and still send a good message than I think I can rethink my eating paradigm] and I am like most people someone who wants to put it all together.

Other stats: I'm 5'1"". Just shrunk to a size 3, which I haven't been since I was 10, 20-21% BMI. [BMI is more important to know because muscle weighs more than fat] And in my early 30s.

I want to save you money and to really succeed. If you don't have your eating in check don't bother buying this DVD. The real reason people quit the first month of working out is not the DVD, technique or the teacher its the diet, stress and lack of sleep. I'm sure of it.

Truthfully, this DVD is for someone that understands education must be coupled with fitness. Also, this is for someone who has or is beginning to get their eating habits in check. Most real experts and those who really take care of themselves in the field of fitness know that 80% of the journey is about good eating habits. Also, it's about a healthly strong mental attitude. That's 100%. So now it's 180% you need to give when learning how to workout. And I say ""learn"" because successful people understand it's a process even when it comes to something like learning how to do kettlebell workouts.

First off, you should know that Andrea was trained by Pavel. After reading about him and some of his books, I was particularly impressed with his views on fitness and stretching in particularly.  I first learned about kettlebell on a fluke. I was actually googling topics on better ways to stretch. I'm all about the quickest yet most effective ways to workout with as little time as possible. I read lots of expert blogs and Pavels ""Instant Stretching"" before I even bought a kettlebell or this DVD. I picked this DVD because I knew she was trained by Pavel and I'm a sucker for the title. I admit I want a goddess body. Who doesn't?

Why I gave this four stars? Because I knew what I wanted from this DVD. The workouts are ridiculously short (15 mins) and nothing like I've ever done. Yet I get the same amount of soreness the next day had I gone to the gym and worked on the machines for 45 minutes. You will do things like a turkish getup, walking around a room, roll up and down a mat, squats and so much more. And all you need is 1 or 2 kettlebells?! Not a full room of equipment that cost you hundreds of dollars.

Certainly you can feel something even after the first set. OMG, does it workout the whole body. It hits all 3 planes of motion. To really appreciate what kettlebelling is google the topic of the 3 planes of motion, kettlebell versus dumb bells

The presentation of the DVD gets 3 stars. I don't mind no music. In fact, if it bothers you that much put on your own music. However, I think Andrea did this on purpose. I'm not a DVD fitness junkie. I've studied yoga, done karate for 5 years and am returning to the level of athleticism I've missed so much. But I go slowly and patiently. I realize to get the most out of any workout, and I know this sounds crazy, you have to be 100% focused.

Until you can master the techniques of kettlebell-ing and you are confident to do this without guidance, I suggest you turn off the ipod, the phone, have your kids walk your dog and focus. And yes, Andrea and her two lovely assistants don't have the best presentation. Quite dry actually. However, all 3 of them are awesome because they make the exercises look easy. Don't let their tiny frames fool you!

Where I am in my kettlebell development, I am confident in my form and am very body conscious. This is due to years of sports and yoga, which tied in the more mental aspect of learning about the body. It's not a spiritual concept anymore. You need to be focused in the present to get the most out of any workout. Considering all that I know, I know I'm teaching my body something totally new, therefore this DVD needs my total focus or I could injure myself.

I get sadden by some of these reviews, or the attitudes of individuals who don't understand why going to the gym or yoga class for 5 months does not get a result. Therefore, they blame the teacher or the technique.

My NLP background teaches me to get to the mental and emotional root cause of why a person doesn't get a result.  I say this sincerely, but I realize those who don't get the result are not being focused in the moment. Because you create an active level of mental engagement when you are.  You activate more muscles and your body develops positive habits by focusing.

But first you must CHOOSE to want something more for yourself. Success is a series of choices. Sometimes their not your favorite choices but something like taking 15 minutes out to workout will add up to something beneficially in the long run. Staring in the mirror or watching television takes your attention away from things like good form that will help you to get the most out of the workout. One major goal is to one day not depend on the DVD or the teacher.

Be it yoga, pilates (which Andrea is a trained pilated instructor), tai chi, running, rock climbing whatever, a success athlete will tell you, you need to be focused on the singular task, be it a pose or winning the race. How is it any different from a DVD. You cheat yourself if you spend your time critique this DVD because of it's lack of music or that the presenters don't give a hollywoodize presentation. Now you're just making excuses. Focus on what result you want.

There is some good information on here! I guess because I've been studying mind/body connection for years I can appreciate it and hear the messages with more depth and understanding. The 3 women on the DVD probably have years of expertise to them. I know there is no way they can share all of that knowledge in a DVD. What I also know, have been trained in NLP is that you learn more by modelling. Actively using all your senses (visual, auditory and kinesthetic). I recommend you watch the DVD a couple times before attempting any workout. It' no different from watching a cooking show when you follow the recipe it turns out great but if you don't then you are left wondering why the dish wasn't as good. Unless your an expert chef don't deviate from the recipe. Kapish?

Andrea does tell you how to use the DVD. For example, when she recommends 2 times a week cardio and 3 times a week resistance training. When I did hear this recommendation, for a moment, I didn't think you could get a cardio workout from these workouts but damn I was wrong. You get cardio and you get the satisfaction that your whole body is dynamically (as opposed to staticly) involved. If you are a real beginner you might not value this recommendation. Your body needs 24 to 48 hours of recovery time when working out a muscle. To work the same muscle several days in a row can cause injury. I talk from experience and my stubborness. So you may not understand all of what she says but you need to learn to exercise your other big and important muscles. That's your brain and your ears. This information is just as important as the workouts itself.

There are workouts that are set up by Andrea and there is feature where you can rearrange the workout. For now I'm sticking to her format. It's plenty for me. And hearing them breathe in the background tells me they are really workout with me. I'm cool with that. I know where my focus is suppose to be. Where will your focus be?

5 stars to Andrea for being a pro at what she does
4 stars for the workout
5 stars because kettlebell kicks ass, my ass.
6 stars because it cuts my workout time by 75%
3 stars for dry presentation but I have my goals so time to let go of excuses.

And a gold star to you if you're determined to improve your health. Rock it!

Hope this review helped.",1335225600,12,8388,4.362820512820512
3507566,4,B001CBFH0E,"There is so much footage on this DVD that it would be near impossible to describe it all (although another VFer, Carol, has provided some very nice breakdowns of the individual Goddess workouts).  Therefore, I'm going to focus on mainly providing an overview of the DVD's format.

The DVD is led by Andrea Du Cane, a Master RKC (Russian Kettlebell Certified) Instructor.  She is joined by two other RKC instructors, Nicole Du Cane (who leads the stretch segment) and Kristann Heinz, M.D.  The three women are exercising in a rather sparse studio with concrete floors; kettlebells are set about on pedestals.  There is NO music during this DVD and very little talking overall--i.e., Du Cane often simply introduces the exercise and the begins the repetitions, with virtually no setup, form pointers, or other information.

The Main Menu of DVD breaks down into MANY different submenu menus, as indicated by ellipses.  Here are the options from the Main Menu, with brief comments and times added by me:
*Play All
*Introduction (Andrea provides a 5min overview, including the general layout of the DVD, the option of using 1 or 2 kettlebells, and the importance of wearing flat-soled shoes)
*Quick Start Review...
*Workouts Menu...
*Medical Benefits from Kettlebell Training (Kristann reviews general exercise benefits; 4.5min)
*Pregnancy and Kettlebell Training (Kristann discusses kettlebells and pregnancy; 8min)
*Get the Most Out of Your Kettlebell DVD (this option instructs the viewer to place the disc in a computer drive, which will access a PDF file with additional tips on programming your own workout, breakdowns of the Goddess workouts, and suggestions for workout rotations)
*Contact Information...
*Credits

Quick Start Review brings up a submenu offering tutorials for some of the exercises.  These are brief (the entire segment is only 6.5 minutes) but helpful, especially given that few form pointers are offered during the workouts themselves.  Here is the submenu listing:
*Play All
*Swing
*Clean
*Military Press
*Front Squat
*Windmills
*Snatches
*Power Breath

The Workouts submenu consists of three options that lead to their own submenus.  These are Goddess Workouts - Design-Your-Own-Workout - Bonus Drills.

The Goddess Workouts ALL include the Joint Mobility/Warmup (5.5min) and the Cool Down Stretches (7.5 mins).  They range in length from about 20 to 30 minutes, and as noted above, they are described in the downloadable PDF file.  They are listed on the menu as follows:
*Artemis: Upper Body
*Athena: Full Body Strength
*Auxesia: Abs & Core
*Callipygus: Legs & Butt
*Nike: Cardio & Endurance
*Odyne: Strength & Cardio Kick-Butt
(Note:  I had an odd problem with this particular menu in that while I was viewing it, the DVD kept stopping--not freezing, but acting as if I had hit the ""stop"" button--which happened several times.)

Choosing ""Design-Your-Own-Workout"" brings up another submenu with the following options:
*Joint Mobility/Warmup
*Upper Body Drills...
*Lower Body Drill...
*Cardio/Conditioning Drills...
*Abdominal Drills...
*Cool Down Stretches
Selecting any of the ""Drills..."" leads to yet another submenu which provides pre-set workout options (usually three, A, B, & C, although there are only two for abs) as well as an actual drills option listing ALL of the exercises available.

The final section of the Workouts Menu is the Bonus Drills.  These are a series of unique exercises that do not appear elsewhere in the workout, and they can be selected directly off the menu:
*Clean - Press - Overhead Squat
*Clean - Squat - Press
*Turkish Getup
*Bottom Up Cleans
*Farmer/Waiter Walks
*1-Legged Military Press
*1-Legged Lat Pull
*Crush Curl
*Pyramid Deadlift
*Triceps Dip

This DVD would be best suited to experienced kettlebell exercisers who don't need a lot of instruction and who are looking for a no-frills DVD which offers plenty of options.  I would give it 3 stars for lack of production values/instruction (I don't mind the lack of music, but I would've liked more cuing/instruction during the workouts themselves) but 4 stars for the quality of the instructors and the plethora of workout options.  So, THE KETTLEBELL GODDESS gets 3 1/2 stars from me.",1319932800,12,4204,5.2807807807807805

Listening to the breathing and grunting is bad enough but add in the counting of the people off camera and it's very enoying.  The biggest problem I have with this DVD is the lack of instruction.  There is a quick tutorial at the beginning to explain some of the moves and that's it.  She does not give any explanation on how to do the moves during the workouts.  It's just breating and grunting.  NO talking.  If you have received prior in depth instruction on kettlebell moves then this DVD may work for you.  If you are like me and have used kettlebells some, or not at all, DO NOT waste your money on this DVD.  I wish I would not have.",1289260800,13,713,4.293233082706767
3507574,1,B001CBFH0E,"I have been doing kettlebells for over 8 years. I found this DVD boring and a waste of time and money. I have Pavel Tsatsouline, Anthony DiLuglio (my favorite), Lauren Brooks, and Mike Mahler DVDs--these all put the Goddess to shame. For women starting out, Lauren Brooks is excellent in that she has good instruction, timing, and music. Even Iron Yoga and Sarah Lurie's ""Kettlebells the Iron Core Way"" are far better DVDs than the Goddess. I sent my copy back over a year ago so it is a bit tough to recall the exact reasons but the overall reason was it was boring, lacked timing/counting, and music. After using the other instructors DVDs and the great video clips at Art of Strength, it is not hard to put together a routine. (Deciding whether to use reps or interval timing is important.) I wish I could give a better detailed review, but like I said, I sent it back over a year ago. I just remember thinking I could not believe the great reviews this DVD was getting and I was glad Dragon Door had such a liberal return policy. I think a beginner would do much better with Lauren Brooks or Anthony DiLuglio's ""Training Clinic"". (My daughter gave the DVD a try and told me she just couldn't watch much of it. She has had training from an RKC instructor and has been using kettlebells for at least 7 years.)",1285286400,29,1311,4.443983402489627
3507575,3,B001CBFH0E,I thought this DVD was well put together. There are a lot of different workouts on it and you can select and combine them as you want. It is good if you are wanting to switch your workout like your supposed to do after 6 weeks to keep losing weight. I did drop lbs with this as other kettle bells workouts. The routines are kinda silent except for breathing. I did buy this based on other customer reviews. The only thing is the workouts are jerky. They are hard on your joints. I really prefer a smooth flowing action from move to move. There are a few softer moves but mostly all the moves are more like a mans heavy weight lift drill. I did like it when I first got it because of all the variety but after a couple of weeks I wasn't really enjoying it. There are very few exercises I really like. Kettle bell is one of those but the presentation has to be right. I really liked the DVD that came with my Bally kettle bell. So I searched for one similar to that and found Kettlenetics. It's smooth and flowing dance types moves that are motivating and kinda fun. And it is a workout! It has got me toned and makes it easy to workout and loose weight. I know a lot of women will really like the Goddess Workout but it's just not for me.,1283385600,6,1237,4.115702479338843
3507576,3,B001CBFH0E,"This was my first exposure to a kettlebell workout. While it does a good job of teaching kettlebell basics, it gave me the creeps. The instructor's informative but awkward.

I can only do this video every now and then because these women are all peculiar.",1283126400,,444,4.632911392405063

I did like the fact that there was no cheesy music to accompany the workout so I can just throw my own music on that I want.
I kinda' wish that the choose your own workout option had a way to program a workout instead of having to flip through the menus to pick and choose which workouts to do.
Other wise, an awesome workout that will give you great results. :)",1277942400,3,537,4.0754716981132075

There are many places throughout the DVD (and there are many workouts so I didn't discover this right away) where the video or the sound, or both, drop out altogether.  Also, while I have no problem with my DVD player with any other DVDs I play, sometimes my machine says it cannot read/or, the DVD is incompatible with my machine. Thankfully, amazon has agreed to replace this dvd for me, which is an example of stellar customer service. Hopefully, this will prove to be just a single bad recording and not a case of subpar production quality overall.

It made a lot of gurgling noises when i first put it in the dvd player - had to take it in and out twice to get it to read.  This DVD is odd compared to all the other exercise dvd's I own.  I'm supposed to just watch what these ladies do and follow along for the most part with little or no explanation/direction.  In most of the exercises, it is no more than what you would do with a free weight - why the kettlebell??

The over emphasized breathing with otherwise silence is so annoying - no counting the reps - no music as background - just loud breathing into the mic.  And, just as annoying are the delays between each exercise to prompt each one with a title screen - they are too long and unnecessary.

I don't believe i can return a DVD once viewed - but i won't be using this one much - if at all. A stupid purchase choice and waste of my money.",1257379200,6,949,4.075268817204301

If you are a beginner, I recommend From Russia with Tough Love book/video by Pavel Tsatsouline which goes through basic moves and emphasises correct form and alignment.  Also note, one of the individuals featured in the Goddess Workout is Andrea's daughter.  So Ms. Du Cane has had a kid and also has abs to die for!

As for the ""correct weight"" of kettlebell to start with -- remember this is dynamic, not static, weight lifting.  I started with two 4 kb (about 9 lbs) kettlebells about 8 years ago.  I have slowly progressed to 6, 8, and 12 kb kettlebells.  I am a 62 yr old female.

Miller is a good example of a well done DVD.  The Goddess workout was actually very creepy.  She starts by saying the excercise that will be done and begins to do the excercise in total silence even without any music playing (and her daughters? are working out behind her in silence too) and all you can hear is this freaky breathing by all of them.  Only bright side is that there were some new excercises that I've never tried before, but I'll do them on my own, never watch this DVD again.

There's a PDF file on the disc, and I recommend printing it out so you can have a handy reference to the progressions and rotations they suggest.

I find that I don't notice the lack of music, I like being able to observe their breathing patterns, I guess it helps me keep focus on my own.

I'd suggest that you have a range of kettlebell sizes available, to make sure that you're working at the appropriate level of exertion for each move. I have three, 10, 15 and 20 lbs, and so far, get the most use of the 15 lb one. (For example, I'd use a lighter KB in the uppper hand when doing windmills)",1236211200,9,763,4.141891891891892

I found this a very good and challenging workout - I am reasonably fit but haven't weight trained for a while - and I am using a 20lb GoFit kettlebell for most of the moves - although I find some of the high lifting arm moves too challenging so use a 10lb kettlebell for those. It is a bit strange having no music but I quite like it as it means you are really concentrating on doing the moves correctly.... I can certainly feel I've done a workout afterwards and even more the next day!!!

The pace was a bit too slow as well - for my taste anyway. However, the next day I was quite sore in my upper back and obliques, I couldn't believe it. I've been doing weights for 20 years and don't really get sore much. I will probably do sections from this DVD occasionally (with my own music playing), as an add-on just for something different and I really love kettlebells.

Andrea kicked my butt so hard with a 15# kettlebell the first time I did the lower body workout that it was sore for five days!!

Yes, there is no music. I love that. She is very serious, and her approach is no-nonsense and to the point. Just get 'er done! I have made tremendous strength gains in my core and behind.

3507604,3,B001CBFH0E,"I have been doing KB workouts for about 2 months now.  I have Karen Brooks' workout and a couple of Anthony DeLuglio's DVDs (Providence and KB Training Vol. 1).

The workouts on this video are very short and tough.  The Goddess workouts are less than 30 minutes, including warm-up and cool down.  The add-ons and drills are less than 15 minutes.  If you are short on time, these workouts fit the bill.  If you want a longer workout, you'll have to get creative with the chapters.

There is a PDF file on the disc that you can print out to ge a better understanding on how to combine the sections to create your own workouts.

The instructors don't talk much.  There are no cues as to when to start (""Ready?  And,...begin...,"" etc...)  Counting can only be heard as part of the breathing.  The lead instructor provides minimal guidance.  Some of the basic movements are explained in separate chapters, but other moves you'll have to learn on-the-fly, with no explanation.

One instructor, who is also a doctor, looks a bit panicked some of the time, and her form falters during many of the exercises.  She sometimes loses her balance, looks like the KBs are controlling her (rather than the other way around), or just looks like she's struggling to keep up.

Some of the exercises use two KBs - two-handed cleans and swings, for example.  Many of the exercises can be done with regular dumbells - renegade pushups (pushups with alternating lat pulls), single leg squats (called 'pistol box squats', I think), back lunges, waiter walk, dragon walk, deadlifts (good mornings), etc.

I think the layout of the chapters is a good idea for someone who is motivated to create their own workouts.  However, there needs to be more explanations of the exercises while the exercises are being done.  Some motivational words would be helpful too, especially when you're ready to just drop the KB and give up!

There is no music, which did not bother me.  The workouts are tough (although a bit short), the talent a bit dull, guidance from the instructor minimal, and the set is simple yet attractive.

I prefer Art of Strength's workouts.",1231718400,68,2126,4.732970027247957

If I can ever get myself to progress to the longer sessions (and I am hoping to do that this winter), I know I will see a difference!  This is the only DVD that I have found with the short workouts that you can combine into a customized one for yourself.  For that alone, I recommend this DVD!
