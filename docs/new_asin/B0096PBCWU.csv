8536850,4,B0096PBCWU,"Both Masterson and Doc Holliday have a feud in this film. Each feels strongly that he wants to kill his foe. Each is convinced he can outdraw the other. Wyatt Earp stops the fight saying both are his friend and he doesnt want to lose one of them. He is successful during one shootout, but the two foes say they will face each other again.
Bat tries to prove that a man who helped the Indians  the chief is played briefly by the actor who later plays Tonto in the Lone Ranger films  did not kill a man. We viewers know that another man did so to stop the Indians from obtaining land promised to them. The killer forced a man to say he saw the accused man kill the murdered man. The accused man is found guilty at a trial and sentenced to hang.
Wyatt Earp and his brother Virgil have small parts in the film, but Bat and Doc have the key roles. A romance develops between Bat and the supposed guilty-mans daughter. Doc also loves her.
When Bat is in trouble will Doc come to help him, and if so how and why?",1438214400,,1005,4.122448979591836

8536852,5,B0096PBCWU,"One of several Westerns during the early 1950s produced by cheapskate ""Jungle"" Sam Katzman and directed by the future master of the horror gimmick, William Castle. Surprisingly, though cheap by budgetary standards, all of these Westerns are quite good and very well made featuring quality leads such as George Montgomery (as Masterson) and also in BATTLE OF ROGUE RIVER and FORT TI, John Hodiak and Robert Stack in CONQUEST OF COCHISE and Scott Brady in THE LAW VS BILLY THE KID. Katzman liked to keep well known Western figures alive in his films, Bat Masterson, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, Jesse James, the Dalton boys, Cochise, Blackjack Ketchum, etc. It lent authenticity if by name only. MASTERSON OF KANSAS is no exception.
Here we have Masterson trying to prevent an Indian uprising by keeping alive a beloved Indian agent who has been falsely accused of murder and sentenced to hang. He teams up with his arch rival Doc Holliday (wonderfully played by character actor James Griffith in quite possibly his best role ever) as they put off killing each other to see justice meted out. It's 70 minutes of pure Technicolor fun crammed with gun blazing action. Wyatt and Virgil Earp are around as well, and the finale of Bat, Doc and Wyatt strolling down the main street of Hayes City, guns drawn, mowing down the bad guys left and right makes one truly appreciate how great and important such stuff was when seen at a Saturday afternoon double feature. They certainly don't make 'em like this any more, and we less fortunate because of it.
Great rousing action, a great James Griffith performance, great Technicolor location shooting! Highly recommended.",1428019200,,1683,4.929577464788732
