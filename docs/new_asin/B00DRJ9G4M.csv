5851346,3,B00DRJ9G4M,2nd in a trilogy. This is an odd story albeit a little dark humor about a overly zealous religious woman who is odd and gets odder when her estranged husband shows up.,1389657600,,167,4.25
5851347,4,B00DRJ9G4M,"This film (I just finished watching it) is a remarkable expose on how faith can lead us to places that are no better than if we were  indifferent to religion altogether. Through her obsessive compulsive praying, prosthelytizing  and self flagellation Anna Maria ends up no better off than those she tries to convert. She is entangled in a tug of hatred, mistreatment and numbing coldness with her Muslim husband who demonstrates that his belief system has served him no better. He drinks, smokes and verbally abuses his wife and her beliefs which are Christian. Very powerful although a little difficult to watch. I recommend it.",1389398400,4,629,4.980952380952381
5851348,3,B00DRJ9G4M,"This is Indie at it's best, along with Paradise: Love. Dark, desperate.. Not everyone is going to like this.
I wish I could view the movie, Paradise: Hope, it's the only film from the trilogy I haven't seen.",1389052800,,207,4.473684210526316
5851349,1,B00DRJ9G4M,This shows a conflict of faith in ridiculous ways. Not worth watching. No value in its content on any level.,1388707200,,108,4.45
5851350,3,B00DRJ9G4M,"I liked the first film in this trilogy, ""Paradise Love"" enough to watch this one.  This is as uncompromising a look at a woman's actions in her own quest for ""paradise"" as the first, although she searches in a different place.  The film is unquestionably well done; the acting is remarkable.

However for sheer ""watchability"" (I avoided the use of the word ""entertainment) this doesn't come up to the level of the first.  The setting of Kenya, with its beautiful beach, the nice hotels, the bright colored clothing, all give visual pleasure even as the plot is troubling.  There is a certain playfulness in the tourists which adds to the enjoyment of the film.  Here there are no brightly colored walls or naked people having sex, here there is only a dreary  beige apartment in Austria, and a plain woman who dresses in monochromes.  Apart from the absence of visual delights, the repetition of the woman's actions, as we see her in her religious duties is not a lot of fun.  This is not a mass in a beautiful cathedral with flowers, incense, stained glass windows and organ music.  This is another variety of the Catholic religious experience, one of austerity, self-flagellation and grim devotion.

The women in the two films are sisters which adds to the richness of the film.  It's interesting to see their similarities as well as their differences.  One wonders what their childhood was like to form these personalities and obsessions.  One obvious thing they have in common is their attention to cleanliness!

I found this film more difficult to watch and it took me two sittings to get through it. It's very slow moving, some of the action is troubling and although I found the lead woman to be sympathetic, none of the characters is very likable.  I think that if it were not part of the series I would not have bothered with it.  I will, however, try to find the third, to see if things perk up for this family!

One correction to the Amazon review:  the woman is not single, she is married.",1388448000,2,2001,4.64957264957265
5851351,2,B00DRJ9G4M,"To be frank, this is not a movie that will appeal to most viewers--even art film aficionados. Two arcs evolve simultaneously--severe marital discord and religious fanaticism in a modern European country.  Although this plot does offer some potential, the production, itself, is very slow moving and sedentary.  I had much the same criticism in my review of the first part of this trilogy (""Paradise Love"") and can't recommend either.  Call me a ""Philistine"", but that's how I see it.",1383609600,5,483,5.0886075949367084

8596685,5,B00DRJ9G4M,Strange Little Lady..but she grew on me. I love movies that have characters with depth ..the sort that linger days after you ''meet'' them This one is one of them. If you like foreign film and simple character study of people this is a good choice. I have seen all three in this trilogy and this is my favorite.,1432857600,,311,4.288135593220339
8596686,4,B00DRJ9G4M,"Paradise (German: Paradies) is the collective name of three films directed by Ulrich Seidl: Paradise: Love (2012), Paradise: Faith (2012) and Paradise: Hope (2013). They focus on three women from one family; one of them travels to Kenya as a sex tourist, one has to spend time at a weight loss camp, and one tries to propagate Catholicism. Three women set out to fulfil their unfulfilled dreams and longings. Paradise is the promise of a state of permanent happiness.as well as a commonly abused concept in the tourism industry. These are 3 women from one family,two sisters and a daughter. The method is to shoot fiction films in a documentary setting,so that unexpected moments of reality can meld with the fiction. The film is shot in original locations. The cast consists of actors and non-actors,setting up a certain tension. All 3 films tell stories that are fictions but had,as a starting point, personal observations,experiences and encounters with others. They both draw on reality and reinvent it. Each film can work as a stand-alone piece or connect as part of a triptych. Seidl has revealed a preoccupation with sex and prostitution in his films and documentaries. These three women have low market value,so they look for love elsewhere. For him for whom corporality plays an important role,its in the unbeautified you find beauty.

Seidls aim is authenticity,yet you wonder how say he set up the 1st film,Paradise: Love,where sugar mamas,over 50s Austrian women,partaking of sex tourism, look for love and sex with the beach boys,who are all non-actors,give them love in exchange for money,a form of global prostitution. There are scenes of embarrassment for the beach boys(as well as the excellent actor playing Teresa),where you thought the global sex trade operates in 3rd World countries for western tourists. For the beach boys,love is business,and they have wives and children to support. Similarly,Seidl takes the three theological virtues and transposes them into the modern world,shorn of all their metaphysical connotations,despite the middle film,Paradise:Faith depicting a Catholic fundamentalist,who does missionary work during her vacation,so that Austria may be brought back to the path of virtue. She targets immigrants. Shes seenstruggling to convert an alcoholic Russian prostitute. She carries a two foot high statue of the Virgin Mary from door to door. Her real struggle begins when her husband,an Egyptian Muslim,after years of absence,confined to a wheelchair, comes home. She only has love for Jesus,and prefers masturbation with a cross to sex with her husband. Such a battle between the estranged couple ensues over his rights as a married man and their differences of religious belief. This was my favourite of the 3 films due to the beautiful way each scene is shot,almost perfect,and the strength of subject matter,the acting.

Seidl does not write dialogue,although his films are based on scripts,but the settings,pre-production and what comes out during filming,leads to a certain measure of improvisation. Seidl seems to want to disturb or discomfort the viewer. Hes a provocateur, delving into Austrias psyche,in a confrontative manner,crafting a state of the nation work of art. His cameras gaze is unflinching, straddling fiction and non-fiction, in an age of globalisation,exploring the consumerist ethos where the West can buy anything. He wants viewers to identify with his hapless protagonists. Anna Marias self flagellation,though medieval,is believable. He asks a lot of the actors. Melanie (Lenz) ,the overweight adolescent,trying to lose weight at the boot camp in Paradise: Hope, develops a crush on the camp doctor,theres no overt sexuality in their encounters. You feel he is sending up Austrias past through the militaristic PT intructors. There is a lot of humour in all 3 films,even if its of a scabrous kind: If you're happy and you know it,clap your fat! as the teenage dieters sing in a group in English. All 16 camp inmates perform under their real names. Lenz had experienced an actual Diatcamp prior to being cast. All 3 films take place over the same summer. The recurring motif in Love,where an emotionally bereft Teresa tries and fails to reach Melli on the phone,counterpointed by Mellis own attempts to ring her mother for emotional reassurance. Her auntie at the start of the film(the one in Faith) is shown taking her to the camp. Not always easy to watch but rewarding,when you realize that Seidl is one of those pathfinder film makers, attempting to make such films.",1407542400,2,4543,5.239010989010989
8596687,2,B00DRJ9G4M,"The woman in this movie daily whips herself while kneeling in front of a cross, thinking that it will atone for sins in the world.  She has left her crippled husband, not a Christian, who needs and wants her because she says he's full of sin, while she spends her time going door to door trying to convince people that God's mother is there to help and save them.  It leaves one wondering, since Jesus came to save sinners, and told us to love each other as he loves us, what on earth is she doing?  She's so far off the track.  I watched the whole thing, thinking that there was going to be a redeeming moment at the end, but there was not.  She was brutally cold to her husband, leaving him alone to crawl on the floor, hiding his wheelchair.  He was paralyzed from the waste down, or at least unable to move his legs. No explanation was given as to why she treated him like that.  So, I guess this movie was a comment on how one can so blindly think that they are honoring  God, but in fact are a dishonor to Him, supported by incorrect teachings, as nothing in the Bible indicates that we should be like this.",1406851200,2,1113,4.192488262910798

8596690,1,B00DRJ9G4M,I got absolutely no message from this film - besides the obvious - that people often substitute religious fervor for all that is missing in their lives.,1392681600,2,152,4.666666666666667

8596692,2,B00DRJ9G4M,It is just another view about the religious fanatism and ignorance of the big majority of people around the world. In this case is in Germany in which the messianic efforts of the Catholic church are shown on how to pursue impossibles. This religious institution in our modern world is only a toothless lion and the pathetic scenes in this movie are a sample of such statement.,1390435200,,377,4.641791044776119
