5523387,5,B00AWN5ASW,"Emily over at BluntReview (dot) com says: House of Cards is one of the scariest dramas this viewer has ever seen - and that includes both seasons of American Horror Story. The reason HoC's is so intense? Simple: it plays so terribly true.

Politics are known to be a tad nasty. But, you aint seen nothun' yet.

Story goes...Your about to get a peek behind that curtain. But know now this is an adult geared drama fine tuned into a heady work of fiction so real, you want to see the consulting credits.

Through one particularly creepy Senator, Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey), we watch as people we voted in to office finagle Bills, puppet people like modern day Geppettos, and ambitious career climbers' find themselves sunk deeply into the left pocket of some game they're playing; for no other reason than a favor is needed by an opposing member...or for an agenda planned well down-the-road.

In the role of loving wife you are served one Claire Underwood (Robin Wright). She is a smart, conniving, shapely barracuda disguised in the season's finest frocks. Slithering beside Claire, as Underwood's personal lap dog we meet Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly). Yeah, if that lap dog was a rabid Maltese with its eye on a prime rib...in or out of the source's anatomy.

And ladies and gentlemen, may we introduce rising journalist Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara). Here's a chickbabe that doesn't mind using - and being used. Where is she getting those scoops?

Finally, but certainly not to be out done in anything-for-the-career is a young go-get-'er other-side-of-the-shipyard politician in the hairs of Underwood's plans, Peter Russo (Corey Stoll). This guy will make your jaw drop a few times at the shear depths he's willing to peruse in the name of personal success.

Everyone in and around the plots and subplots of House of Cards is riveting. The lengths the characters go to for...well what ever it is they want - and here read WANT! - complete with a foot-stamping tantrum in mind. Each episode intertwines a personal life soap operetta with the everyday cogs-in-motion of a few people in various stages of political power. You watch in horror as ""We the People,"" vote in these masked pontificators, who with our unknowing nods of approval, cut 12000 jobs to garner a mere 3000 for no other reason than it suits their personal agendas or that of the corporation that supports their campaign.

As all the remarkable drama unravels you may start to feel a bit heavy-hearted, as the realization that this ""show"" is part of what happens in our government branches happens every single day...It is politics as usual in deed.

That being typed, there's nothing as usual from this cast. The acting is precise; look at the cast. Kevin Spacey as Underwood is gonna give you acid reflux. You know this person under another name, is up at ""The Hill"" weaving Bills and laws without an iota of care for where his constituents chips may fall. And Mr. Spacey does bad so good.

Stoll as Russo makes your skin crawl. He's just an ass. But his pliability by those larger up on the political food chain knows at your comfort level. You may need a jar of caramel sauce handy for quick infusions of happy endorphins; the chemicals and high fructose corn-syrup subsidy in today's decadent faux creation seems entirely appropriate.

But even as the men are swimming amongst the sharks, it is truly the gals that tend to steal the show. The womens' roles are smartly written and there are no wilting flowers in this bunch of grab-you-by-the-throat ladies. Zoe is chilling. Claire is a delight to watch weave her web of decided devotion vs. self-agenda.

Uber-talent, Robin Wright, plays Claire on a razor's edge. Just when you think she's got a pulse, she'll go and, well, do something, momentarily reminding you just how sociopathic she has become. Ambition is the undercurrent for both she and Zoe.

And Kate Mara takes her version of Zoe from a persona-to-the-world of a doe-eyed newbie, to the werewolf headline seeker she is in 0-to-80. Zoe's goal is to be someone - and to hell with anyone in her way. Brava Ms. Mara. A gal role with titanium balls.",1361750400,6,4130,4.783707865168539
5523388,3,B00AWN5ASW,This started off very slow and I found myself actually drifting away from the screen but somehow Kevin Spacey seemed to keep it going for l3 episodes.  A fine actor he is who could make this lackluster overblown story of intrigue in politics limp along for so long and hold my interest.,1361404800,2,286,4.5
5523389,5,B00AWN5ASW,"""West Wing"" gave viewers a taste of a White House populated by government folk who fought the good fight and had its citizenry foremost in their concerns. No such luck here. In this outing, the people of the United States barely exist in the minds of government. They are fodder for those seeking to gain, or seeking to stay in, power.

Here's the scoop. Kevin Spacey plays congressman Frank Underwood, a very bright, savvy individual who knows his way around Capitol Hill. He knows how to get things done because he knows what's in people's souls and how to play them to his advantage. His wife, Claire (Robin Wright) heads up a a more socially conscious organization in the private sector but is no less addicted to power than her husband. They have a peculiar relationship to say the least. This is almost a diary of the various 'projects' in which they are involved and how they play them, even when unforeseen things happen.

This is some ugly, scary stuff. In my heart of hearts I don't want to believe this view of our government, but I fear it is probably a closer take on reality than is ""The West Wing."" The manipulation of people, the press and other politicians will make you puke in your shorts. The relationship between Frank and Claire alone can only make me wonder what world they must have lived in as children that allowed them to grow up in a way that would make them think behavior like this was Okay.

David Fincher (one of my favorite directors) helmed the first 2 episodes and well establishes the color and tone for the rest of the series. There is a greenish pallor to it which gives it a sickly feel. All the acting is top shelf and a fleet of veterans are on hand to insure that. The directing is good. The writing is exceptional. This is as good as any series I've seen on TV. My hat is off to Netflix in that they didn't feed it to their audience one episode at a time. They released the entire series in one fell swoop allowing their viewers to watch it when they please.

This is a remarkable effort and I hope the ratings are such that Netflix keeps it going.",1360972800,625,2091,4.409326424870466
5523390,5,B00AWN5ASW,"Kevin Spacey shines as congressman Francis Underwood. A modern day Machiavelli. There is no good and evil in the world of politics, only power. Netflix hit a homerun with this series. An outstanding cast, script, and direction. David Fincher's brilliance shines through in this look at the interworkings of U.S. politics. With some dark twists and turns and a nuanced look at people's ambitions and fears, House of Cards stands stronger than its title'd metaphor. Robin Wright as Claire Underwood is excellent and at times more cunning than her husband. Kate Mara shows great promise as an up and coming reporter looking for a fresh scoop. The rest of the cast is also very strong. Not a weak character or element to the show. My wife and I devoured the entire season in less than a week. Highly recomend.",1360886400,214,805,4.798561151079137
5523391,5,B00AWN5ASW,"All in this series is superb: script, acting, emotions, ideas. David Fincher was involved in the project and the final result has the look of his films: clean, well composed, crisp and with a superlative attention to detail.
See it. You won't regret it.",1360800000,3,253,4.7727272727272725
5523392,5,B00AWN5ASW,"Kevin Spacey shines as a power-hungry Congressman gaming his way through the political system to get what he wants, alternately promoting and throwing others under the bus. Cynical, raw, cold but fascinatingly gripping, House of Cards paints a picture of Washington where good men go to die and only the most ruthless can work their way up the ladder. The series also boasts an impressive cast that's about as perfect as any TV series can be. Robin Wright and Kate Mara stand out though frankly the whole cast should be considered for award time.

David Fincher has put his trademark stamp on the look and feel - the sense of betrayal, loss and glossy decay permeate every scene. The plot avoids the usual trap of getting increasingly absurd (Dexter, anyone?) and instead focuses on delivering a complex, broad story that's much more akin to a great novel. This is an update of a British series by the same name that was equally excellent but there's enough new material that you wouldn't necessarily know they were connected.

Fans of political drama, Kevin Spacey or just plain good entertainment are going to love this Netflix Original series. It's actually the sole reason I reactivated my Netflix account -- apparently they are about to release a new season of Arrested Development as well. House of Cards is currently offered on Netflix streaming and the episodes have been released all at once so you can watch the season at your own speed, though I imagine a DVD set will be in the works soon.",1360713600,11,1501,4.769230769230769
5523393,5,B00AWN5ASW,"The Netflix original series ""House of Cards"" features some extraordinary performances from well-established actors, as well as a well-written script and smooth and competent direction.  The real star of the series though is raw naked ambition, and how it infests and steers the lives and thoughts of the three main characters:  husband-and-wife and partners-for-power Congressman Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey) and environmental NGO head Claire (Robin Wright), and cub political reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara).  In their own pursuit of power and glory, the lives of these three individuals inevitably become entangled, snaring those who unfortunate enough to be in their way or silly enough to want to be in their way.

Of all the characters, Congressman Francis Underwood has turned the pursuit of power into his own personal religion.  The series starts off with a newly elected president denying Underwood the position of Secretary of State, which motivates Underwood to dream and scheme for a higher position.  Throughout the first season's 13 episodes he relentlessly pursues his ambition.

That is not true of his wife though.  Claire is supposed to be his husband's true and faithful partner, and in one revealing scene she confronts a man who has always hated Francis Underwood for corrupting her.  Claire then explains that she chose Francis because he could see her for her true nature, but the explanation is so violent that we as viewers must think she only says this to mask to herself her grave doubts about the grave she and her husband are digging for themselves.  Indeed, throughout the series, while Francis is energized (buying a rowing machine and eating salads for lunch, as a consequence) by the political intrigue that he has unleashed, Claire becomes burdened by a weary festering but ultimately fettered conscience.

""House of Cards"" is a political thriller with a not particularly interesting plot.  What redeems it is its attention to detail, to nuance, and to subtlety, and the decision of the directors and producers to portray political power as honestly as mass television would permit.  It seems that everyone is tainted and corrupted by power so that redemption is never a possibility in ""House of Cards.""  The series also makes we viewers the personal confidante of Francis Underwood so that now and then he turns to us, winks at us, and tells us how the game is really played in Washington.  In this way, we're tainted and corrupted as well.

""House of Cards"" is supposedly based on the British novel and the BBC mini-series, but I suspect that the series' real inspiration and source material is Robert Caro's biography of Lyndon Baines Johnson's path to power.  Like Johnson, Underwood is a Southerner with a gift for gab, for telling stories, for understanding the minute mechanisms of Congress, for reading people, and ultimately for corrupting people.

A lot of viewers will think ""House of Cards"" too cynical, but I think it's too naive.  In real world politics, every politician has the ambition and amorality of Francis Underwood, but in real world politics no politician has his cunning and strategy.  Evil may be banal, but it's also stupid, crass, and lazy.

""House of Cards"" doesn't rise to the same genius as ""The Wire,"" but in many ways ""House of Cards"" is far more entertaining and relevant.",1360627200,24,3344,5.065693430656935
5523394,5,B00AWN5ASW,"The show premiered all at once and awed me enough to get me to watch the entire season with very little breaks between episodes. I highly recommend this and will purchase it on Blu-ray, despite being able to watch it on Netflix. The cast is fantastic, with Kevin Spacey nailing his role as the smart and evil Francis Underwood, the series is also well written and has enough twists to shock you.",1360368000,127,395,4.5

5523410,4,B00AWN5ASW,"If you have never seen this series, watch season one, the first episode of season 2 and stop. It's all downhill from there. The first season was by far the best written, and carefully crafted not to beat you over the head with any of the usual liberal messages Hollywood generally requires in everything it makes. How refreshing!  It was plain old entertainment with Spacey once again showing why is one of the best actors around today. The much older princess bride (Robin Wright) is Spacey's wife and just as enigmatic as Spacey and seemingly just as evil.
Sadly, this series devolves into the usual hollywood crapola in Season 2 , pushing favorite liberal themes like homosexuality,  racism, extreme feminism, inter racial romance, etc. Pretty much wrecks the rest of the series. Becomes nearly unwatchable by Season 4. So stop after the first one.... Except that first episode of Season 2 which ends with a shocker...",1499904000,,921,4.897435897435898

5523412,5,B00AWN5ASW,"This is the 1st season of HOC ,and this is in Blu-Ray, which renders incredible definition in sound and images, following an amazing story-line with acclaimed actors like Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright, and many more.

This first season (and the rest of the seasons) is an Americanized version of the original BBC British production, adapted from the novels by Michael Dobbs. This BBC series was actually a trilogy: The House of Cards, To Play the King, and The Final Cut.

From the first scene with Spacey in the American version, the viewers see who and what his character is, and this sets the tone for his behavior for the rest of the seasons of this TV show, which has won multiple awards. We were hooked on just the first episode and were sorely tempted to binge-watch the rest of this season at one go, but I'm glad that we didn't, so that we could reflect on what we had experienced and talk about it.

We bought this season in a Blu-Ray format, but we made a serious mistake by buying DVDs for some of the subsequent seasons. We were very disappointed in the lack of sound and video definition, which is the very meaning of what Blu-Ray truly is. I would not recommend watching this series in anything other than the Blu-Ray format.",1498262400,4,1237,4.538116591928251

5523420,3,B00AWN5ASW,"Good acting, good political thrill,  nice cinematography... I thought I liked it first, then halfway through the first season it started to feel like a bad rehash of Otello, with Frank Underwood as Yago speaking to the audience with occasional moments of wit. Only, Shakespearean tragedy was being softened into rating-friendly melodrama plagued with Hollywood formulas like stereotypes, clich&eacute;s, post-modern philosophical agendas, cliffhangers and graphic gratuity. Especially the graphic gratuity as a bait in first seasons is usually a bit of a turn-off for me. Thankfully just for the first season for the most part. Jeff Beal's re-gifting us with a bit of a copy/paste of the main theme he made for HBO's Rome was a little distracting too. He fixed/tweaked it a little for further seasons and it kind'a grew up on me. It has its moments of wit and political drama leaning much to a one-sided view of the political spectrum some times. I thought I might abort the mission and put my leisure time to better use... like reading pregnancy/baby books... but I keep going back to it. It seems to have it's entertainment value and although I can't quite put my finger on why... I'm not 100% crazy about it.",1494979200,,1211,4.936274509803922

Kevin Spacey is at his best as usual, and it's great to finally see Robin Wright onscreen again after her long hiatus post-Forrest Gump. The problem isn't that the story line isn't intriguing, or the writing isn't good, or that the acting is sub-par. All of the above are extremely well done. Why I hate this show is that it is disturbing to such a dark level, and suspiciously close to the truth about how our political system ACTUALLY works. Just like the old maxim, here art definitely does reflect life. Furthermore, there is no levity whatsoever. There are absolutely no characters to root for as everyone is equally diabolical. There is no humor, and no break from the single dark story arc that this series pursues through all of its seasons. The result is that although the viewer may conclude that they watched a finely crafted show, you end up getting the negativity of it all over you.

Other than that....eh, it's one of those series, like Boardwalk Empire, in which every character is an amoral monster and the story is one long, extended wallow in the mud, with the writers seeking to exceed every previous episode in degeneracy (e.g.  the President and First Lady's three-way orgy). The few characters who seek to expose the Underwoods are bland, forgettable and ultimately just as compromised and amoral. In addition, what's the point of the whole thing? We know that Frank Underwood's machinations bring him the Presidency.  Who is the Macduff in this tragedy? Like most American TV series, this is just going to go on waaaaay too long for no apparent purpose.",1482969600,,853,5.0

Very tight fight and really no way to remove discs without putting your fingers all over them and running the risk of scratching them in an attempt to remove them from the very tight fitting sleeves.

But I don't agree with its overly cynical and sometimes impossible plot. Two newspaper reporters are not going to make an easy transition into the new media, and if they do, they certainly will not have the time to investigate a vote in Congress, the entangled relationships, and the suspicious death of a member of Congress. New media is not producing Woodward and Bernstein.
Amazing that Frank moves on with his relationship with Claire, or Remy, after they sunk his vote. If he stayed in character, he would be plotting their demise.
And something just plain sloppy. Frank was in the driver's seat, and the would-be Governor was in the passenger seat when he closed the garage door. The police would not rule that a suicide by any means if they found the victim in the passenger seat.
And finally I'd like just one redeeming character and a touch of real humanity. Politics is tough but most people get into it for the right reasons.",1471219200,,1103,4.63265306122449

The Godfather told about mob actions and prohibition; real life problems in the 20's and 30's.  The House of Cards tell about politicians corruption and manipulation in the political arena, real life problems TODAY.
I purchased all 4 season's and have watched the entire 4 season's 2 times.  Kevin Spacey Fowler is an excellent actor.  He was so convincing that I was almost confused as to whether or not he killed Zoe and Peter (LOL) I mean I know he did, but when he was denying his involvement in those murders, man --he was convincing.  I pointed out Kevin Spacey, but I think all of the actors and actresses were very good; all of them made the story very real and interesting.

5523522,2,B00AWN5ASW,"I may be one of only about 176 people in the world who doesnt like the Netflix series House of Cards.  Last year, I began watching Season 1 on Netflix, thought the first two episodes were so-so, and then lost interest in it. Later, I bought Season 1 on Blu-ray and started watching it again. By episode 5, I had come to dislike the series so intensely that I stopped watching it altogether.

I have two main problems with House of Cards: first, it isn't all that interesting to me, which is surprising, because I really I enjoy shows with political themes. (The West Wing is one of my favorites.)  House of Cards  premise, which is based on a British miniseries with the same name, should have held me spellbound but it didnt.  Im not sure why.

My second problem is that the American version of House of Cards doesnt compare favorably with its British counterpart. I watched the entire British House of Cards trilogy and loved it. The characters were just as malevolent, and the scripts were just as good. I found something oddly fascinating about the entire show. Perhaps it was because neither the actors nor the scriptwriters took themselves too seriously.

I cannot say the same about the American edition of this show. Every character seems to be in competition with every other character to see who can be the biggest bad guy. There are simply no redeeming characters for me to empathize with; everyone comes across as a villain.

I tried mightily to like House of Cards, but in the end I gave up on it. Its too cynical, dark and dreary for me. I guess Ill have to go back to watching episodes of The West Wing to get my dose of political drama",1468454400,5,1651,4.498327759197324

This is what I believe goes on in D.C. and has for a long time, power hungry politicians out for themselves and nothing or nobody else,that go back to their constituents and lie to their face to get votes then when back in power it is business as usual.

I love this show, but cannot share it with my spouse, who is a Spanish speaker, because the version available in the US is English only. Her sisters are watching the show in Mexico, in Spanish, and loving it. But she cannot share that enjoyment because this alleged first world country does not have a Spanish version of the show available. Obviously it exists, otherwise her sisters would not be watching it in Mexico, in Spanish.

productions that offer an untamed view of humanity's dark side.  If you want a more detailed view of the dark side of politics, as if the current media
is not enough, this takes you through that emotional endeavor.",1462492800,,357,4.461538461538462

5523568,5,B00AWN5ASW,"Now I know what all the fuss is about. H of C is in its 6th season and I finally started watching it, mainly because I don't have Netflix. I don't know how long it's been on Amazon, but I'm glad it is now. I love the show, and I love watching it like this, one episode after another, with no commercial breaks. I did that with Breaking Bad also, having not gotten into it until season 5. It's great. The only thing I have to watch out for is spoilers. I'm careful what I read and listen to. Kevin Spacey is terrific as Francis Underwood, conveying a monstrous authority and sociopathic manipulation. And Robin Wright is excellent as Claire, Frank's wife in a marriage of convenience. As much of a business partnership as anything. It's a little weird the way Frank talks directly to viewers at times, and in a way I wish he wouldn't. I don't know if this keeps up through all the seasons. But other than that it's terrific. Skullduggery and office/political drama and subterfuge.

The characters are refreshingly dark. Even the females are allowed to be cold and selfish, not the standard ""strong but vulnerable"" fare.

There is a bit of an ick factor in the show's sexuality (classic Hollywood daddy-daughter fare), but at least this behavior is presented as psychopathic, not wholesome and normal. There are more nude shots than I would like, but less than I have come to expect. In general, House of Cards exercises restraint when it comes to disturbing imagery, making it safe to watch before bed, but not safe enough to watch with your parents.",1461801600,,675,4.810344827586207

Every one of them was an arrogant, self-serving, back-stabbing jerk. In fact if half the characters  were killed off, the only thing I could morn was that  all the rest of the characters were not killed off too. This show is totally about jockeying for position up the social later without any thought about what might be good for the county.  This is not my idea of entertainment.  I could not take away anything good  when it was over.  There were no good ideas to get behind, no moral ideals, no useful knowledge, not even a good laugh now and then.

5523663,1,B00AWN5ASW,"Do yourself a favor and watch the original British version. The Americanization of the story is quite thin by comparison. Ian Richardson was brilliant in the leading role; Kevin Spacey is just laughable with his over-the-top southern accent. The lumpy clown-face is more suited to supporting comedic roles, not a powerful lead. Washington DC may be filled with self-serving pricks, but it is ludicrous to think that the Frank Underwood character could out-wit a child, let alone other power brokers.
Then there is the ridiculous amount of filler, endless cell phone conversations, text messages, and other pointless dialogue that does nothing to move the plot forward. Really, stick with the original, where not a word or action is wasted. The American version has three-way sex scenes, Spacey pissing on graves, and all other manner of gratuitous nonsense. The British know how to tell a story, and to conclude that story without excess. The American appetite for endless serials results in shows with excessive padding and subsidiary storylines that go nowhere.
Sure, there have been some excellent serials in recent years, e.g. ""The Wire,"" but that show had an episodic nature in which each of the five seasons could stand on its own. ""House of Cards,"" on the other hand, is nothing more than a soap opera with swearing. The story should have been told in about 10 episodes, not five times that number.
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Robin Wright's big face, atop an impossibly long and cabled neck. How nauseating such a strong visage can be. No fun looking at so much face.
Not sure why people like this show so much. No accounting for taste I guess.",1453939200,2,1658,4.903914590747331

The English version was more entertaining and more of a spoof...but this is just plain ugly. It is nothing more than ugly unhappy people trying to control others. I can understand some of that....but you don't get a break from ugly in this program....Even the rotten people doing perverted sex really dislike each other....",1449792000,5,465,4.89873417721519

5523729,1,B00AWN5ASW,"I sat through season one...just barely.  The most perverse and abhorrent behaviour is showcased and justified as story and character development.  They do it in a rather sly way.  They have several scenes of dramatic dialogue and when you're fairly comfortable and in a PG routine,  they quite suddenly display content of a very hard R rating. ( drug use, sex scenes, etc.)

Season two REALLY rolls out the agenda.  Whereas season one dealt with generic political issues, season two decides to use real life political issues in order to attack the military, Tea Party, conservative republicans, and those who are pro-life .  The message is clear.  All the evil, dark, sexually perverse characteristics of liberal democrats are still not as evil and dark as the military, Tea Party, and conservative republicans/individuals.

I stopped watching.  I'm tired of being told my beliefs and morals are what's wrong with the country. Frankly, it's the other way around.

And yes, I'm mad that I didn't stop sooner.  I should have.  But, curiosity killed this cat.  Don't make the same mistake.",1443571200,7,1086,5.02808988764045

Through one particularly creepy Senator, Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey), we watch as people we voted in to office finagle Bills, puppet people like modern day Geppettos, and ambitious career climbers' find themselves sunk deeply into the left pocket of some game they're playing; for no other reason than a favor is needed by an opposing memberor for an agenda planned well down-the-road.

The plot line is one-dimensional, however, and often improbable,  trying  to show  in how many different ways ambitious people can overreach, and little more.  It  gets boring after a while. The British version, by contrast, was more interesting and nuanced although, there too, there was a lack of subplots or other diversions from the main message: ""How can I screw you?

5523829,4,B00AWN5ASW,"House of Cards, Season 1
Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors, so I was excited to watch his foray into an online only form of a television political drama series in House of Cards. The main character he plays does not disappoint, a ruthless, amoral, manipulative villain disguised by the pleasant demeanor of his outward role of House Majority Whip. However, the sexual analogies and metaphors he uses with other politicians, or in his first person narrator role spoil it for me. They become more frequent and more sexually explicit (as in downright disgusting) with each subsequent episode. He can still make the same points without reverting to crass and excessively sexually graphic language as a default mode. The Washington Herald head editor shares the same problem though this is not a default mode for him thankfully. I realize that this won't bother some people, but this is a drawback for me, hence one star down. However, other characters are equally compelling as the quintessential villain such as Kate Mara's 'floating' journalist character and Robin Wright who plays Spacey's wife, a sharp business woman in her own right. She presents an intriguing mix of a mysterious and magnetic vibe. Also, the plot line is fast-moving and with many twists, making it hard to predict the ending of each episodelove this!",1436054400,,1329,4.990990990990991

Fantastic character development, plot twists, and moral dilemmas. Well, actually, some of the actions are not dilemmas and are simply morally repugnant but totally fascinating. Spacey and Wright are human versions of voracious spiders that sometimes choose to nibble on each other. There's a scene with Wright toward the end of the season that I'm still pondering--was her action malicious or was it pervertedly kind? And just you wait for the first episode of season 2....",1433980800,,615,4.866666666666666

5523895,1,B00AWN5ASW,"Although Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors on the planet, he can't save this detestable Americanized remake of the original BBC version starring Ian Richardson.  Script in this American version is boooorrrrriiinnngg and lacking the rich detail of the original.  I forced myself to watch it.  The key lines in the BBC original were replicated and POORLY.  Direction was absent, the dialogue was hackneyed.  The opening scene with the dog and the 'aside' (drama term where the actor talks directly to the audience, also used in the BBC production) was the only good one.

Lackluster cast, but then what kind of script do they have?  Garbage.  West Wing this is not.  Seriously, I had to start and end and start the video over and over like a C-grade movie you tell yourself you must finish because you paid for it.  Fire the scriptwriter, fire the director, fire whoever handles the sound because it's bad, nearly inaudible.  And God bless Kevin Spacey for living out his contract.  Every day I'd regret signing on, were I him.

Final Cut?  Bleh.  The BBC ending of the same Final Cut title is to-die for.  This American one, who cares.  So this American is very disappointed.",1431302400,3,1179,4.729064039408867
5523896,5,B00AWN5ASW,"House Of Cards is an intelligent series focused on the unashamed quest for power and influence by an ambitious politician played expertly by Kevin Spacey. Supported by his equally ambitious wife Claire, played brilliantly by Robin Wright, the couple deal with scenarios presented to them in a calculated way in order to further their social and political standing with the aim of real long lasting power. The writing is slick and the quotes are memorable especially whenever Spacey speaks directly to the viewer who he frequently allows inner access to his deeper desires and strategies. You may think you have met somebody with these character traits but I assure you that few people walk the walk and talk the talk in such a confident and self assured manner. Most people pretend to be truly ambitious and when push comes to shove will hide behind walls and get others to do their dirty work. Not this character, he is the real deal and possesses the skills of an impressive wordsmith in addition to a charismatic personality with the ability to effectively influence those around him. Highly recommended to the discerning viewer who is interested in style and substance more than fleeting fads.",1431216000,,1197,4.960199004975125

5523916,3,B00AWN5ASW,"The very promising first three episodes successfully transposed the original English, brilliant, dark humor political satire. Thereafter it simply reverted to typical bloated off-the-shelf plot and dialog soap opera. By episode 9 some of the dialog was so inept it challenged the actors to maintain credibility.
This is what you get when cinematographer, director, producer and writer(s) change every episode. Impossible to maintain character and plot credibility because the actors simply stand as mouth pieces for whatever is put in front of them for that episode. No character development, no sharp, incisive, suspense-filled plot development. Spacey (F.U.) is perfectly cast  as the American equivalent of the original brilliant Richardson's Urqhart.  But that's about all there is to it.

Presumably he gets paid very well to phone in a caricature of Kevin Spacey being Kevin Spacey. The rest of the characters are as believable or credible as any in any soap opera.

The original series ""suggested"" more than it stated, and that was part of the engagement and ""fun"" of the series. This  version grinds out in mundane detail every possible (ripped from today's news) factoid, spiced with the occasional soft porn.  And that is not fun, nor entertaining, nor engaging.

Three stars because: If you enjoy soap opera, this is fine. If you enjoy a ""realistic"" portrayal of the the political fiction we are fed by the news media, this is fine.

I watched series one and, being an optimist, watched series two. It didn't get any better. Time to move on to other things.",1429833600,3,1568,5.12156862745098

5524014,5,B00AWN5ASW,"My husband and I really like Kevin Spacey and were advised to try this series. Spacey's character in this series keeps us wondering how sinister he can become. We have completed season one and two. We are currently watching both seasons again. You can't watch just once, it is so detail packed that you miss things in your first viewing. We can't wait for season three. This is our new favorite series, bar none. All the actors are so believable in their rolls, your feel like they are your family and  friends...the evil ones.",1426464000,,527,4.6063829787234045
5524015,3,B00AWN5ASW,"this show is very good. However I think there was more hype about the show than the substance in it. Yes, the acting is great and the filming picture perfect as any other current show, however I'm not sure this is very original neither something to write home about. I am still watching but I would like to warn the audience that it is not all that. I also think that sometimes the story drags and you end up in situations wanting to fast forward the show. On a side note, the fianc does not like this show. She hates the fact that Spacy looks at the camera and speaks to you as if you were in the theater or next to him watching the story unfold. She also hates the music.
I guess a 3 would be fair..",1426464000,,701,4.0503597122302155

The Box: DVD cases might have been rocket science in the 1990s but today there's no excuse. This BluRay set comes in a cardboard box which 3 out of 4 disks had slid down into the glue that held the cardboard together. So I had to spend ten minutes per disk cleaning glue off before putting them into the player. All disks required bending the disk and pulling hard to get them out, and given that getting a grip on them was difficult and required gripping by the mirror side, eventually (with season 2) I elected to rip the cardboard box sleeves open to get the disks out.

5524147,3,B00AWN5ASW,"This is a remake of an excellent British series, but it does not have the charm of the original. It does not even have the political depth of the original.

For one the main character who is the democratic majority whip in the House of Representatives in the first season, then the Vice President in the second Season and will be the President in the third season is just hilariously unbelievable. That man is a mixture of Spiro Agnew who ended up in prison, Richard Nixon who was illegal from beginning to end with his tapes and his Watergate business and Al Capone who ended up in prison for evading taxes, all in one, the latest American political trinity. Kneel down and bow your head to pay homage to that new democratic Titus Andronicus. As such no one can believe the slightest detail of the plot. Political fiction has to be believable otherwise it is just plain shooting itself in the foot, if not both feet.

The plotting in Washington DC is well known but it is pushed so far that it looks like the IRA in the good old days. That man has some kind of private hit man on his staff who can kill or dig up garbage on anyone, provide women at a price and generally to embarrass the man with pictures or push the man into some kind of alcoholic coma that will enable the boss to come behind and finish the job.

That boss does not even hesitate if he has to kill someone. He is not even as careful as Al Capone who was never indicted for a murder. He becomes so hateful, being himself full of hate and him inspiring hate in us, that we cannot even enjoy the plot anymore. He has no empathy, he has no compassion, he has no sympathy for anything or anyone. He inspires disgust and loathing.

And his wife is not better. She is a dressed up female version in a skirt. They don't even have a dog or a pet of any sort. They are monsters and such people cannot last long in politics because sooner or later, and nowadays sooner than later, someone will talk and some trash collector will collect the trash about them and expose it. Whistle blower in politics are like fungus in a cesspool.

Whats more the scenic panorama of Washington DC is so evanescent that we lose the charm of London and the Palace of Westminster not to speak of Westminster Abbey next door. Washington DC is like a hygienic and sanitized version of an old European capital.

You may enjoy it if you do not believe in politics and look at it as if it were some Sherlock Holmes enigma or some Hercule Poirot investigation. But it is not.

5524175,5,B00AWN5ASW,"Have to agree with other reviews... this is the best political drama I have ever seen. There are NO sacred cows, in any party or ideology. Well, except one... the media journalists are presented the way they used to be: investigative hound dogs that stop at nothing to get the truth behind a story. Today, the media are lapdogs of certain politicians and everybody honest with themselves knows it.

But there would be no ""House of Cards"" drama with a lapdog media. So the journalists are old-school and it makes for great interaction. And I can dream of what it would be like if the media were honest journalists instead of the ""public relations arm"" of this administration.

Kudos to Netflix for keeping their own ideology out of it. Amazon and HBO could learn from this (but they won't). Yes, I'm talking to you, Amazon... Alpha House?... Really? I tried watching the first season. Actually, if anything, House of Cards will appeal especially to Libertarians, because Democrats and Republicans alike take it on the chin. If you are a hopeless ideologue of either party, either you will be educated by this series, or you will burn the DVD in naive outrage.

***BTW... several incidents actually prophesy real life circumstances... Like the challenge to Boehner's leadership in the House recently and his revenge when pulling two guys from their committees... I am not going to mention the others... see if you catch them.",1422662400,,1423,4.871900826446281

I am a huge Kevin Spacey fan and also like Robin Wright, and although I am not generally a fan of political dramas, the acting and writing makes it worth it.  You get a chance to get beyond the basic plot of political intrigue and start to see the psychology of the character.  It's fascinating.

The box arrived looking true to the picture and by all reports the discs are in great shape.",1420675200,,544,4.294117647058823

I was addicted instantly. Had to rent from library as not a Netflix subscriber, but knew I would buy as soon as available on Amazon. Two very close friends with different social/political viewpoints are hooked, so we have plenty to discuss. Warning: if you have qualms about the realities of the world and what power is really all about stay away from this program. Think Godfather meets Washington D.C. The opening scene gives instant perspective as well as Underwood's comment that he loves his wife ""like a shark loves blood"".

Francis Urquhart was quite chilling enough without the excesses written into Frank Underwood's role. To top it all off it was very poorly written.

5524307,5,B00AWN5ASW,"First, thanks to Cathay Pacific for putting season 1 of this series on its in-flight entertainment system. It made the long flight from Hong Kong to Chicago go quickly. It also prompted me to buy season 2.

Kevin Spacey is a masterful actor. This series showcases him in his prime. He plays his character with subtly and conviction. Supporting actors all give strong performances.

The story could not be more Machiavellian, which is what makes it so compelling. It is outlandish at times, but never unbelievable. Surprising twists assure that the plot is never dull. The blend of domestic and political drama is perfect.

Few series manage to attain this level of excellence. Kudos to everyone involved. House of Cards is just outstanding.",1418169600,,740,5.0

5524309,5,B00AWN5ASW,"My wife and I initially chose this DVD out of one of those Red Box systems that sits outside our neighborhood grocery store. I'll admit that while we were mildly curious, we picked this one only because nothing else in the Box looked very exciting. It has long been my experience that the more a show is 'hyped', the higher it belongs on the Avoid This Scale. And I had heard some talk about House of Cards being good. I was prepared for a snoozefest of Kevin Spacey being brilliant among a cast of barely employable extras and eye candy.
Within minutes we were hooked. We immediately cancelled all other plans for the evening and remained nestled in our couch where we watched the entire first season episodes back to back.
Superb writing, stellar production values, and a fantastic cast. I have not watched television--cable or network--in well over two years preferring instead to read books. Even when I was a TV consumer, I never watched shows a second time. At age 50, I own a DVD player, but not one single DVD. Once I've seen a 'movie', I'm done with it.

Warming up to it, I guess I expected too much from how popular it is.  Yes there is a lot of corruption,  We still elect our politicians.  It's pretty awful in real life, as in House of Cards, but to all those who are shocked or cynical, or hateful, would you rather be under a closed non freedom of speech government?  Can't even imagine the corruption in such countries!  ""Democracy is a very bad form of government, but all the others are so much worse.""  Good idea to write to our elected Sen. And Congr.

5524321,5,B00AWN5ASW,"I have only just begun to screen ""House of Cards: Season 1"" and have already ordered ""House of Cards: Season 2.""  This is excellent training for those yearning to be Machiavelli.  Kevin Spacey is the fictional equivalent of Mitch McConnell.  Now we now how Mitch has survived for over 30 years.  Robin Wright is almost a ringer for a younger Helen Mirren in looks and very similar to the steely Helen Mirren in her many dramatic roles.  In these respects Wright also resembles the California actress Cheryl Heyermann.

I screened the British version of this series several years ago, so I kind of know where it is going and how it is going there.  It is somewhat predictable in the American Way, but one can see the evolution of the political drama on Cable since the days of ""The West Wing"" on broadcast network.  No one in our society is an angel or close to it.  All segments of political life are corrupt, toxic, fueled by blackmail, extortion, and the usual suspects of lies, cheating, dirty tricks.  Our government is basically dedicated to decimating its citizens.  What we are seeing here is far from fiction and it further demonstrates how much lower things have deteriorated from the days of Watergate when there were still a couple of honest people around the various estates.  I worked in Washington, D.C. a long time ago, and I know a little about the hidden underground.  Watching the Seasons of ""House of Cards"" will enable me to be a better citizen against my government.",1417305600,,1487,4.694980694980695

Personally, we need to clean all of the rats out of that city if you ask me - both major parties are just as bad.  But H of C has gone past the realm of possibility.  I'll finish watching it, but the way Frank became the President, with everyone just selling themselves out, and Frank remains unscathed, is just ridiculous.  Will I keep watching it?  Yes, as long as it remains entertaining.  But now that I think about it, maybe one, lone person such as Frank could dupe the idiots we have in power right now.

5524390,3,B00AWN5ASW,"This show has a lot going for it. At the top of the list I would place a very talented group of actors and actresses. Of course, Kevin Spacey is a household name, but I did not know any of the other faces before watching this show, and they all do a phenomenal job. The show is well produced, well directed, it has an interesting (and complex) story arc, it is well written, and it is not dumbed down in any way, shape or form. I have only watched a few episodes so far but I found them quite entertaining and I could definitely see becoming addicted to this show. However, I am not sure I am going to continue with the show, and here are some of the reasons why:

I find the show to be a little too slick. I get tired of shows where every character is a fast talker, capable of delivering a witty and cutting remarking without hesitation - where every conversation is a game or a contest, a verbal repartee between two dueling virtuosos who never miss a beat or stumble for even a second. I also do not think the show is doing anything really new. It promises to be an inside look at Washington, where we get to see ambition stripped of all its outer accouterments - but, we have all become so cynical about politics in this country, it is no longer shocking or even all that interesting. Maybe there was a time when people actually believed that politicians meant what they said in their speeches, or thought that politicians were all dreamers and idealists with nothing but the public good on their mind and in their hearts, but it would be hard to find anyone who believes that today.

We all have some vague idea of the role that money plays in politics, and we have seen so many Washington scandals, we are no longer shocked - or even surprised - when we find out a politician is doing drugs, or sleeps with prostitutes, or accepted illegal campaign donations. We are aware that there is a lot of back room dealing going on, we are aware that politicians are often disingenuous and express what they think the public wants to hear rather than what they actually believe. We are aware that, when a President picks his cabinet, he is not motivated solely by who he thinks is the best person for the job. We are all aware that there is a lot of politics (in the pejorative sense) in politics.

If everyone was still naive about politics I think a show like this might be shocking and there might be some value in unmasking the way things really work. It might have the same impact as Gordon Gekko's claim that ""greed is good."" This show seems to me to be going out of its way to be as shocking as possible, but, it is not unmasking anything we have not already seen, it is merely confirming the mood of pessimism that is already the dominant mood in American politics. Ultimately, I would like to have seen a little more balance. Of course there are people who are motivated almost entirely by ambition, or lust for power, but most human beings are more complex than that. Most human beings at least delude themselves into believing they have more complex motives.

We all know that politicians often have to ""sell their soul"" and compromise what they believe in the interest of getting elected or satisfying powerful lobbies. However, in this show, no one seems to believe in anything. It is one thing to ""do what it takes to get a piece of legislation through"" (a quote from Kevin Spacey about the show) and quite another to simply use pieces of legislation, and fellow politicians, as pawns in your own personal chess game. Again, I am not denying that there are people like that, or knocking the show for being amoral, I just would have liked to see a little more balance. Show me someone who actually believes in something who is not an idiot or a bumbler. The few characters who do believe in things are all too stupid to realize they are being used. Francis (Kevin Spacey's character) has no problem playing them all like a fiddle because, apparently, having actual beliefs is enough to make one blind.

This is certainly a well done show, and I applaud Netflix for putting together a quality cast, and producing a show that is unique and interesting, and has some real substance. I am sure political junkies will gobble a show like this up but, for me, it is lacking a certain human element that makes it hard for me to summon much interest.",1414195200,2,4352,4.435

The series opens with him speaking directly to the camera as he deals with a dog hit by a car. It's not pretty, and it only gets more vicious and vile as the season unfolds. Underwood uses everyone, including his wife, who is more or less the female version of him. The newly elected president of the USA passes Underwood over for the job of secretary of state and the balls starts rolling faster and faster downhill as Underwood manipulates everyone for his purposes. An upstart reporter becomes his concubine and mouthpiece. An alcoholic congress becomes a tool. And even his wife has to pay the price along the way. There are very few redeeming characters in this show. They are either part of the problem or not willing to be part of the solution.

5524420,2,B00AWN5ASW,"This show is truly the scariest show I have ever seen because I don't doubt for a moment that so much of this is completely accurate about modern-day politics and people involved in political games. Although it is a well put together show technically, my husband and I have given up on it after having seen several episodes. The language in this is really filthy, about as bad as I have ever heard in a television show or movie. (I don't think I've heard words and phrases as rank and tasteless as are used in this show since I worked on a shipyard decades ago.) And the toxic, repulsive words and scenes do nothing to further the story that I can tell.

The portrayals of politicians and their coworkers are probably very accurate but the toxic language and dark scenes leave me feeling like I need a shower--inside and out--after I watch the show. The characters are so truly dark and repulsive, I find myself unable to shake off some of the sleazy scenes, even when the show has long been finished, like sludge left over in my mind. The Father's Day episode is the one that was just too rank and disrespectful (of the reporter's father and Frank's wife, as well as the viewers) at the end that we decided to stop watching after that.

It's too bad this couldn't have held back some because it could have been a much better show, dealing with the real issues in Washington, seen from behind the scenes. While accuracy may seem important when portraying real-like characters, do we need to see the worst aspects of people's personalities and all of their demons, with such detail? This show tends to leave me feeling sick and uncomfortable, not just from the politics, but from the creators' need to interject so much darkness and sleaze. Isn't it time for Hollywood to grow up and stop assuming that all viewers want is violence, porn, and depravity?

Intelligence, awareness, and enlightenment in the media would surely provide a better viewing experience for everyone, thus providing a more successful future for producers, actors, and all who have the opportunity to bring stories to life. Pass this one by if you don't want to see the very worst of people, demonstrated over and over by just about every character in the show. Kevin Spacey is such a fine actor. I wonder why he agreed to let himself go so low for a performance. I wish I could give this a better review but it truly does not deserve it.",1412812800,14,2409,4.5846867749419955

He IS forever Keiser Sose, the upmost Horrible Boss, the crazy psycho-killer in Seven and in House of Cards, he TRANCENDS a monumental gargoyle, cannibalizes other peoples careers and is a mastermind and cunning conspirator. The acting, storyline, and ALL of the actors and actresses are amazing. Incredible writing. Robin Wright  oh my gosh! She is amazing as his cool and calculating wife. They are the PERFECT couple.

5524482,5,B00AWN5ASW,"Kevin Spacey is on his A-Game. The technique to speaking to the viewer in asides reveals his clearly political maneuvers which would not be as clear to discern if viewer had to determine on their own what was  in Spacey's head the whole time while scheming and formulating  policies. It clearly defines the rough and tumble nature of politics. Unfortunately it feels real and that is disillusioning. It goes to show that casualties along the way are just that casualties. Don't look a second time when harm has been done to the human soul...but maybe that is how the game is played. The other characters are finely tuned but somewhat more vulnerable than Francis. All in all, a good show if you can stomach the immorality, lying, inconsequential sex,backstabbing and natural field of evil that determines policies and defines bills, natural resources, and holds good people hostage to whims of favors. It does make getting what you want a game of wits. It is just a shame I wish the viewer could see some good come from all the jumping through hoops.",1410566400,,1050,4.763736263736264

5524542,4,B00AWN5ASW,This captivating movie keeps you watching to see what happens next.  Loaded with dry humor.,1409356800,,91,5.066666666666666

5524544,5,B00AWN5ASW,"Kevin Spacey is Frank Underwood, a key political player. This series looks at how he does business. Frankly, there's nothing he won't do to get what he wants. He is ruthless! He is also cynical, expedient, a liar, a manipulator, a user and absolutely compelling to watch! Aside from getting the votes right, he's also up for running the news cycle. It's fascinating to see how it can be used to run an agenda. There are moments of comeuppance and a sometimes complicated relationship with his powerful and driven wife.  There's a few moments which are a bit hard to believe but by the end of the series it is really taught and the finale is a real cliff-hanger. The supporting cast is excellent. You hope that politics is nothing like this in reality but history has shown us that it can be. Some of the minor characters are just 'road-kill' - they are used and expended regardless of any culpability in events. It is the opposite of The West Wing. Deals are done to achieve political ends and people, workers and the country are not considerations. This is the party machine man at his worst, and at its most watchable!",1409356800,,1120,4.5721393034825875

I really can't say enough positive things regarding the acting, the quality of the story and its skillful execution on screen but it continually impresses me as a most excellent example of educational entertainment.  After watching the first season through for a second time I was able to grasp 90% of the basic plot transpiring and still enjoyed every minute of this repeat  performance.",1408233600,,793,4.932330827067669
