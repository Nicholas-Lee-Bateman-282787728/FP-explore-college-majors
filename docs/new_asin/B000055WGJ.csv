1393337,3,B000055WGJ,"The Americans cast in this are awful. The English cast is better but the actor who plays Julie Andrews' son comes off as a gay man playing straight and the incredibly sexy and desirable Colin Firth is frittering away good film playing a raving queen, though as always he does it fabulously. Firth's excitement over the Billy Baldwin character is hilarious.",1030752000,3,356,4.852459016393443
1393338,4,B000055WGJ,"Now that we readily accept that royalty can be as tarnished
and media hungry as anybody (in Hollywood), it might take
a minute to swallow the merely mildly amusing premise of
the film: social barriers.
Once you've done that, you have yourself a thoroughly stylish
comedy-bordering-farce that offers moments of gold and gems!
Literally: I've rarely seen a small film as convincingly art
directed as this, looking like 10 times its budget with lush
interiors in rich colours, elegantly dressed people, rolling
lawns and gardens, all bathed in bitter-sweet, golden summer's
light, well echoed in the unusually inspired film music.
It's delightful ensemble playing, well paced and cleverly edited.
Julie Andrews shows superb command and comedic skill, her facial
reactions are priceles. Sophie Thompson does a manic and touching
'rags to riches' turn on Pygmalion. The film has a heart, too,
something not found in the overproduced rubbish that Hollywood
keeps manufacturing to seemingly please brain-dead teens.
- Like a glass of champagne: light bubbles quickly gone, leaving
you feeling so swell:)",1030320000,4,1096,5.377906976744186
1393339,4,B000055WGJ,"Hollywood and English high society collide in a fluffy little comedy, amusing and witty in quite a few places and with a top-rate cast. It's not quite P.G. Wodehouse, a little gooier and less complex, but it'll hit about the same note.
""Everything is quite, quite ghastly."" So says the English aristocrat Lady Felicity Marshwood, and rightly so. America's golden acting couple, Miranda Frayle and Don Lucas, has recently split up after a tempestuous romance. Now the glamorous Miranda is engaged to Felicity's son Nigel, and he's bringing her back to England to meet his dear mum. Felicity is inundated by friends making offers of support that she doesn't want, and the servants (with the exception of the brainy butler) are all in a twitter over getting to meet a real film star.
Then little disasters begin to strike. It's found that Moxie, Felicity's faithful maid, is really Miranda Frayle's older sister. Miranda herself is charming and utterly artificial -- until her slightly sozzled ex-boyfriend shows up, intending to woo her back away from Nigel. Felicity, her wittily charming nephew Peter, and her thoughtful butler Crestwell must try to keep everything and everyone steady as the entire situation spins out of control.
This is a cute little comedy. It has plenty of touches like the Girl Guides drooling over Don, Miranda's makeup and oh-so-perfect hair during her swim, Felicity walking in on Don and Miranda smooching, and the hapless woman being dragged across the Marshwoods' lawn every day by a dog. There's even a clip from the Miranda-Don movie in the middle of it -- a hilariously overacted bit with dreadfully hammy acting. It's great!
The casting is great, though a few are a bit well-worn for the people they are played by: Julie Andrews is great as the serene dowager (when she says ""I think I'll explode"" to Peter, you don't believe she will for a MOMENT!); Stephen Fry has echoes of his Jeeves role as the ultra-brain servant Crestwell; Colin Firth plays a barb-tongued ""idle rich"" who is enjoying the whole fiasco; Sophie Thompson of ""Sense and Sensibility"" plays an insecure and overwrought friend/servant with a Dirty Little Secret. Jeanne Tripplehorn is pretty good as Miranda Frayle (she doesn't overdo Miranda's lies and preening); William Baldwin was overacting as Don Lucas, but he was also sexy as heck; Nigel is enjoyably stereotyped as a stiff-uppa-lip type who is also too stubborn to admit that he made an idiotic mistake with Miranda.
It's PG for a bit of mild language, usually from Miranda and Don. There's no smut (beyond a few passionate smooches) or violence, though parents should note that it is hinted that Peter is gay. But kiddies will probably not fully understand the storyline and might be bored stiff by it; they won't start enjoying it until they're teens.
Okay, so this movie won't make you laugh and cry and vow to go out and live life. It's an entertaining little comedy that is well worth the watch.",1017619200,18,2959,4.908183632734531
1393340,3,B000055WGJ,"After watching this film, it is clear why it was not released in theatres but went straight to video. The fact that it is based upon Noel Coward's play of the same name is immaterial, if the film does not rise to the occasion. Here, it clearly fails to do so and falls flat, despite stellar performances by Julie Andrews and Stephen Fry. That is not to say that it is a terrible film. It is just a mediocre, though pleasant enough, one dimensional film.
Here, American film stars and Hollywood's dream couple, Don Lucas (William Baldwin) and Miranda Frayle (Jeanne Tripplehorn) come to a parting of the ways, when Miranda, tired of Don's lack of commitment, meets her prince charming, British upper crust scion, Peter (Colin Firth), who sweeps her off her feet. When he proposes to her, his mother, the very social and regal Felicity (Julie Andrews) is appalled at this potential mesalliance. The thought of a starlet as a daughter-in-law does not sit particularly well with her.
When Miranda comes to meet the family, Felicity puts on a stiff upper lip, but almost weeps with joy when Don unexpectedly shows up at her home, hoping to woo Miranda back. They form an unholy alliance in hopes that they will each achieve their mutual objective. Felicity is the doyenne of respectability as she manuevers through the human land mines around her. She wittily and seemlessly transitions from one potential mishap to the other, never losing sight of the prize.
Colin Firth is fine in the role of Peter, but it is Julie Andrews, as his mother, who is the shining star here. Stephen Fry also rises to the occasion and gives a wonderful performance as the droll butler, Crestwell. William Baldwin acquits himself well in the role of Don Lucas, though Jeanne Tripplehorn's Miranda is a tad too cartoonish. There is also a subplot involving Felicity's companion, Moxie (Sophie Thompson), and Miranda, one that is not particularly funny or believable. Sadie Thompson handles the role of Moxie well enough, but it is not one of her best performances, as it is too heavy handed.
All in all, the movie is a mixed bag. Occasionally funny, it suffers from lack of depth and underdevelopment of the story. But for the stellar perfomances by Julie Andrews and Stephen Fry, the film would probably have totally tanked. Not even Colin Firth or William Baldwin would have been able to save it. Still, it is a pleasant enough little film, as long as one's expectations are not too high, and worth a viewing, especially if one is a fan of Julie Andrews.
The DVD is a no frills DVD, offering no bonus features. It does, however, provide a crystal clear, wide screen picture and clarity of sound.",1015027200,19,2670,4.744086021505376

1393342,5,B000055WGJ,"Julie Andrews has a problem: her son is in love with a shallow, lying film star and this just won't do...OH BOTHER! The film is full of witty, intelligent dialogue and is good fun.  I didn't care for William Baldwin or Jeanne Tripplehorn but the rest of the cast is delightful.  Colin Firth, Sophie Thompson and Stephen Fry are really very funny and mostly steal every scene they are in. Highly recommended but I doubt that those who think acting dumb, crass or juvenile are the only ways to make a good comedy will appreciate this film.  Too bad for them, Yeah for the rest of us.",1007596800,14,581,4.411214953271028
1393343,4,B000055WGJ,"Hubby didn't even enjoy what he was hearing on the other side of the house coming from this movie.  However, I'd had a hard day, was totally exhausted and needed something extremely light and frothy so I could completely zone out.  This fit the bill perfectly.  It is an English ensemble drawing room type comedy.  Julie Andrews plays a dowager countess in 1953 whose son, the Earl, decides to marry an American movie star.  The countess and her nephew (played by Colin Firth) set the stage to seemingly welcome the couple back to their home but really to break them up.  Helping them along are William Baldwin, playing an American movie star who was the woman's former boyfriend, plus the countess's maid who knew the woman film star in her earlier life.  Slight?  You bet but it was just what the doctor ordered.

1393344,5,B000055WGJ,"This recent release is a must-have for any Julie Andrews or Noel Coward fan. The ensemble cast, including Collin Firth, Jeanne Tripplehorn, William Baldwin, Sophie Thompson and Stephen Fry breathe life into this Noel Coward drawingroom comedy originally written for the stage. The film's script remains true to the play; yet the occasional changes to the play's dialogue fit so seamlessly into the original dialogue that one would never know that it had been changed. Sophie Thompson's acting talents are clearly apparent in her transformation from Felicity's (Julie Andrews' character) servant to a ""friend of the family"" to disguise her real identity from her sister (Jeanne Tripplehorn's obnoxious character) and would have been Oscar material had the film been released originally in movie theaters, rather than going directly to cable television. But the center of the universe is Felicity, the matriarch of the family around whom the entire plot seems to revolve. Julie Andrews was born for the role of Felicity, and her performace does not disappoint. The actors in this film at times give very subtle emotional coloring to their roles merely by a glance or grimmace. There is no question who is in charge of THIS manor! Anyone who finds the differences between Brits and Americans amusing will find this film an excellent choice. The film has a happy and amusing ending and is well worth waiting for.",983750400,51,1408,5.126086956521739

It's funny, but neither sophomoric nor high brow. Julie Andrews is wonderful as always, as is Colin Firth, Edward Atterton and Stephen Fry. The actress who plays Moxie is an absolute riot!

A visit to the manor by the future bride and groom sets the stage for many witty observations penned by Noel Coward.  Julie Andrews is fine as the Lady of the manor and mother of the groom to be, as is Colin Firth as her nephew, and Stephen Fry as the butler.  My favorite performance, however, is that of actress Sophie Thompson playing the working class servant girl Moxie, who is forced to pretend to be the social secretary of Julie Andrew's character, and duly puts into service a hilariously exaggerated version of the associated patrician accent and manor.",1315094400,,733,4.801587301587301
1393376,5,B000055WGJ,"I recently watched this movie for the first time.  Now I cannot stop.  I have to watch it at least once every three days or I start getting cravings.

It's just refreshing to find a talky movie that has people interacting, that is actually addictively enjoyable - no fancy special effects that take the place of a decent story, no trying to shock the audience with a horribly violent opening (and ending), no trying to be melodramatic like those movies trying desperately to be ""epic"".  Just an enjoyable feast of cuteness.

Personally I don't always want to know who the actors are and how they ""played"";  I myself like to lose myself in the fantasy on the screen where the characters are who they are (as opposed to ""played"" by so and so).  Except of course anybody would recognize the superb Julie Andrews.  And she's fantastic in this movie.

So of course is her ""secretary/friend"" in this movie - the transformation was simple yet fantastic!

I would actually say everybody was fantastic in this movie.  I think this might be one of my favorite kind of movies, as I've read they're called ""drawing room comedies"".  Or somethingorother.

The only reason you might not enjoy this movie is if you expected something else.  Don't expect what it's not.  This is for people with good taste :)",1299196800,,1291,4.6755555555555555

However,  His character, Peter is funny.  He can convey more with a facial expression than the American actors in the movie.  As always, Julie Andrews gives a wonderful performance.

I agree with most of the other reviewers that the British Cast (especially Andrews, who is perfect for the role) is great. The Americans (Baldwin & Tripplehorn) are simply awful. I realize the entire premise of the movie would be gone without the Americans, but I enjoyed the film a lot more when they weren't around! But the film breezes along at a nice clip (not like the recent God-awful Robert Altman manor film, which bored me to tears). So put your feet up, grab a martini and enjoy. It really is sad that this kind of movie rarely makes it into the theatres. Brain-dead, illiterate teens are the market the studios go after, and the rest of us yearn for the day when the ""Art Theatre"" (as opposed to a pimply-faced ""Multiplex) returns.",1131148800,8,846,4.5

I think it's pretty much a mindless watch if you're looking just to veg out and have some fun. All the reviews are correct Colin Firth does not play Julie Andrews son but her outwardly gay  hilarious nephew. William Baldwin and Jeanne Tripplehorn might as well have not been in this movie I was bored with them. Julie Andrews, Colin Firth, Sophie Thompson and I think Stephen Fry (whoever played the head butler) made this movie hilarious. I feel they deserved five stars for their parts.

1393392,4,B000055WGJ,"To see Colin Firth as a blond and as a Noel Coward type character is certainly worth the price of this DVD.  For a long time, I have thought that Colin is a splendid actor having first seen him in ""Another Country"" with Rupert Everett.  However, I always viewed him as being a rather serious, dark, intense and  rather gloomy type of actor(i.e, Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice).  As usual those British actors/actresses can not be stereotyped!  Anyone having the perception, as I did, that Colin Firth can only be serious is in for a huge suprise in ""Relative Values"".  He is funny, charming and delightful as a character that resembles Noel Coward.  He is so good that, at first, he is almost unrecognizable.  There isn't even a hint of his ""Mr. Darcy"" side.  It really is a nice change of pace for him and for his fans.
The rest of the cast is also very enjoyable.  Stephen Fry is a delight as a ""Jeeves-type"" character.  Julie Andrews is also very enjoyable!
For a light, forthy movie you can't go wrong with ""Relative Values"".  If you are a fan of Colin Firth and think that he is soooooo serious, treat yourself to a nice surprise and see how versatile this superb actor is.",1035936000,19,1180,4.462616822429907
1393393,3,B000055WGJ,"This is a drawing room comedy based on a play by Noel Coward. Having not read it, I must presume it would come off better as a stage play rather than a movie. Not that this is bad, really...Just that its not as good as it should be. The British cast (Julie Andrews, Colin Firth, Stephen Fry and Sophie Thompson) play their roles flawlessly, the Americans (William Baldwin, Jeanne Tripplehorn) less so.
The plot: a member of the British nobility (Andrews) is dismayed when her son (NOT Colin Firth as some OTHER reviewers would have you believe)becomes engaged to a movie star (Tripplehorn) whose ex(Baldwin) follows her to England to reunite.
Stephan Fry as the butler, and Sophie Thompson as ""milady's"" companion/secretary are wonderful; as are the various actors and actresses who make up the staff of the manor. Likewise, Colin Firth gives a hilarious performance of her gay nephew, who aids and abets in the eventual reunion. The upstairs-downstairs feel of the film adds to the confusion; a welcome distraction from the Balwin/Tripplehorn storyline. It is so obvious that these two are trying to be amusing, that they fail entirely. In contrast, the others, who do it so effortlesly, succeed admirably.
All in all, light & fluffy, but nothing to rewatch again and agiain (unless, as I always do, you simply want another look at Colin).",1032480000,82,1340,4.907488986784141
7930859,1,B000055WGJ,"Online I had listened to a BBC radio version of this play and I thought it was wonderful. This movie is not. The heart of the play is the ladies maid, not the movie star. The screenplay softens the flaws of a very unsympathetic character and focuses on the wrong people. I was extremely disappointed.",1518998400,,300,4.472727272727273

7930867,5,B000055WGJ,"My mom and I used to watch this over and over.  What a funny, quirky Brit Com this was.  A great combination of American and British actors (Including Colin Firth) and a plot full of twists and turns.",1442880000,,200,4.2368421052631575
7930868,5,B000055WGJ,"This one is just fun, full of excellent well known actors and some truly crazy fun moments. It is a bit campy, but on purpose, so tongue in cheek. Also, Colin Firth's grin/smirk through the whole thing may have been part of the acting, but I'm guessing it was also very natural due to the crazy antics. Personally I think he was just totally loving the role and the fun of the whole movie. It was truly a blast and my wife and I had a great hangout/date night, one that will include repeated viewings of this flick in the future for sure.
