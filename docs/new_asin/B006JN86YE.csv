8499486,5,B006JN86YE,Will hold all viewers spellbound and leave many with a determination to make the purchase so they can watch it again and again.  Target audience is probably adult but it will hold 5th grade and up in rapt attention.  Kudos to the Nature programs and to PBS and its affiliates.  This one is a real winner!,1409875200,,304,4.392857142857143
8499487,5,B006JN86YE,"An amazing and beautifully photographed program which takes you through a summer and the lives of bears who live on Alaska's Admiralty Island, including the Tongass National Forest. By the time you reach the close of the episode, you have come to know each bear - their personalities, struggles, defeats and triumphs.  It is impossible to watch ""Fortress..."" and not feel a deep compassion for these creatures who are at once powerful yet enormously vulnerable.  Climate change spares no one.  Even the salmon whom the bears depend on for their very existence.  This film comes close to being a mystery, rather than ""just"" a documentary.  I won't spoil the mystery by saying more.  Just know you become involved with the animals and will find yourself caring about their outcomes.

This film deserves more than five stars. I cannot agree with the reviewer who judges a film on his expectations of Blu Ray picture quality and for that reason, erroneously gives this film three stars.

IT'S ABOUT THE LIVES OF CREATURES WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE AND LIVE ON THE EDGE MORE AND MORE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.  It's not about having the most sparkly, clear picture on the block.  Obviously it's a guy thing.

Chris Morgan's narration adds much.  His observations are well timed and contribute to the quiet drama of the day to day existence of the bears.  His masculine voice  betrays the deep feeling and sympathy he has for these creatures whom he has devoted much of his life to observing.

Feeling burned out on hearing about climate change?  This film might just renew your spirit and touch your heart.  We are ALL involved in this new world every creature on the planet is facing.",1405036800,,1681,4.801393728222997
8499488,3,B006JN86YE,The documentary itself is very good but the image quality is very low for Blu Ray. Looks like a cheap video transfer. There is no need to spend the extra money on the Blu Ray version when a standard DVD will produce the same results when played in a Blu Ray player.,1336521600,8,265,4.115384615384615
