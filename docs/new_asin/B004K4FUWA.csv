4392418,5,B004K4FUWA,We saw this at a local theater and enjoyed it.  This will be a fun addition to our DVD collection.  Looking forward to sharing this with our family this holiday season.,1317081600,,168,4.387096774193548
4392419,2,B004K4FUWA,"I'm not simply just hating on this. I am a huge fan of the stage show - and actually just wrapped a series of sold-out performance back in May. I was ecstatic this was finally coming out and preordered it day one.

Unfortunately, it's pretty awful. They for some reason felt like the show itself wasn't good enough so they added a bunch of terribly 1980's effects like bubbles, sparkles, and giant plungers. Quite possibly the biggest travesty is that they did not sing live, and some of the clips do not include the live audience. How can THIS show be done with LIP SYNCHING?

And though it is cool that the original cast returns, a lot of them are on the tired sides of their careers, and just don't sound as good as they used to.

Overall, this is an incredibly disappointing release. If they would have just set a static camera on the stage and taped the entire show it'd probably be a 10/10...",1316649600,7,898,4.397590361445783

4392438,5,B004K4FUWA,"Very enjoyable. Great to just put on every once and awhile and hear the old standards. I wouldn't call the style ""Barbershop"" though although it the group does sing tight 4-part harmony.",1430697600,,186,4.84375
4392439,5,B004K4FUWA,"Such a fun show for baby boomers or anyone open to the oldies but goodies!  That bass man is my fave, but ALL the guys are great vocalists and comedians.  Fast-moving show that is well done by all involved in the production!  I have a copy for me but also gave one as a gift to a recent baby boomer turned 70.  Seemed to be appreciated much.",1429833600,,341,4.044776119402985

4392454,4,B004K4FUWA,"Arrived on time, brand new. The production was okay, seems like produced on the cheap side (quality of the picture is not that great), but that's okay, I liked the play, and the songs.",1410480000,,184,4.4411764705882355
4392455,2,B004K4FUWA,Movie paled in comparison to live performance.,1407369600,,46,5.714285714285714
4392456,5,B004K4FUWA,What a great movie! Really enjoyed this!!,1404691200,,41,5.0
4392457,4,B004K4FUWA,A very good & creative movie.  The quartet were good singers.  It was slapstick comedy & I thought it was tastefully done.  The audience was interesting too. There are some surprises in the movie so I won't give it away.,1404604800,,220,4.45
4392458,5,B004K4FUWA,"I was unable to see the play in person, so I was happy to find that someone had the forethought to put a performance on DVD.  If you like some of the older male four-part harmony groups, such as, The Four Lads & The Four Aces, then you should appreciate ""Forever Plaid"".  I did not particularly care for their zany Caribbean medley, nor their ultra zany synopsis of Ed Sullivan's old variety show (I thought it detracted from, and basically ruined ""Lady of Spain"").  The rest of the ""show"" was well done, and reminiscent of the great groups of the late 50s & early 60s.  Because these guys harmonized so well together, I wish they had sung a few more of the great oldie ballads.  They did not have to ""dress"" the show up with goofy stuff--to me that effort was the show's biggest negative.  However, the good far outweighed the bad, therefore, I recommend you get your own copy of  ""Forever Plaid The Movie"".  I should mention that my wife said she thought the ""show"" was more like a nightclub act, rather than a Broadway worthy musical.",1401235200,,1037,4.4787234042553195
4392459,5,B004K4FUWA,Great show and the production values on the DVD are excellent!  Really enjoyed it!! For anyone who loves this show; A MUST HAVE!!!,1397433600,,130,4.6521739130434785
4392460,5,B004K4FUWA,"If you love the music from the 50s, then this is definitely the musical for you.  They do an accurate rendering of the tunes that were popular then and I found myself singing along with almost all of them.  Good memories!  Wish the music of today was more like that-songs that are memorable.",1396742400,,291,4.452830188679245
4392461,5,B004K4FUWA,"This gem of a musical transforms well to the dvd for a fun evening with the family. The music is tremendous and the harmony is spectacular. Take a ride back to the fifties and enjoy the show. This is the off Broadway show you may have heard about but did not get to see. Well here's your chance, and if you have seen it before then you will fall in love with the Plaids all over again. Sit back for some fun and great music!",1393372800,,424,4.0
4392462,5,B004K4FUWA,One of the stars is a personal friend ( Larry Raben).  We have known him since he was a young boy and think he is wonderful.  We went to see the movie when it first came out and did not know the movie was out on DVD until talking with his mother.  We think it is a fun movie for all ages.  Judy Ciecka,1393200000,,301,3.65625
4392463,5,B004K4FUWA,"Four single guys on their way to their first musical gig are killed when they collide with a school bus full of teenage Catholic girls. 50 years later the four ""preps"" return to earth for the show they never performed. Forget the busload of girls (regardless of your feelings about catholics or religion). This was the live musical theater that played worldwide for 20 years and now has been released on film. 83 minus. Color. Pulls out all the stops for musical, family entertainment. Move over sound of music!",1390953600,,511,4.752808988764045
4392464,3,B004K4FUWA,"Having seen this show on-stage 4 times, I was glad to see a DVD, so I could share this wonderful entertainment with friends.  My only complaint is that they shortened this DVD by leaving out the very charming Perry Como segment of the show--what's up with this?  This was disappointing, but it's still worth watching!",1384300800,,317,4.745454545454545
4392465,5,B004K4FUWA,"I have seen ""Forever Plaid"" live four times and it never gets old.  The DVD is of a live stage show with all the presence and pleasure of being at an actual performance.  It is a great cast and who could not enjoy these wonderful songs presented this well.  With the DVD, I can share with friends or relax with my old cat and enjoy a nice evening of ""the Plaids"".",1382313600,,363,4.084507042253521
4392466,5,B004K4FUWA,They did a perfect job with this wonderful live show...they filmed it as it is performed live.  I wish they would do this with other live hit shows instead of trying to translate them to film as major motion pictures.  If you love music from the 50's this is the DVD for you.,1379894400,,275,4.169811320754717
4392467,5,B004K4FUWA,"enjoyed both...Zapata....excellent acting ....great cinematography ....historically accurate
laid....fun...nostalgic...memorable great songs from the 50's.....
Thanks for sending these two great films",1379203200,,200,9.05
4392468,5,B004K4FUWA,The music is one thing; but the chacters keep you coming back. Just glad to have the dvd so I might go back any time I'd like.,1378857600,,126,3.7037037037037037
4392469,4,B004K4FUWA,"I enjoyed this, but it seemed to be a ""dumbed down"" version of the stage show. Also didn't feel the energy of a live production.",1378252800,,128,4.16
4392470,4,B004K4FUWA,I liked the actual stage version I saw in Las Vegas more than the one on this DVD.  The musical has a clever premise which allows them to sing lots of 50's hits.,1377561600,,161,3.878787878787879
4392471,5,B004K4FUWA,"We saw the stage musical in San Diego, when it first came out.  It was so fantastic, we saw it three time at that time. Since then we've seen  it three more time!!!!  About two months ago we went on line to see if it was playing anywhere, that's when we discovered the DVD!!! What excellent entertainment....plan on inviting neighbors in to see it.",1377561600,,348,4.40625
4392472,5,B004K4FUWA,This is a movie of what is usually a live performance for theatre. It is NOT the usual filming of a Broadway show. It is a real movie with animation and special effects and still remains true to the original script. One of the best Bradway-to-film shows ever. A great time for the over 40 set.,1375747200,,293,4.25
4392473,4,B004K4FUWA,"We purchased this DVD as a gift for my father-in-law for Father's Day after hearing him praise this movie over and over. He was so happy to receive it that we immediately watched it. It is very enjoyable, with lots of great songs and close-harmony and cute comedy. I enjoyed it so much that I am considering purchasing a copy for my parents and maybe one for myself.

If you enjoy close-harmony 'guy groups' and music from the 1950s.- you'll enjoy this movie.",1373587200,,459,4.530120481927711
4392474,4,B004K4FUWA,There were a few moments in the first 30 minutes when the sound was mildly to moderately distorted and staticky,1369872000,,111,4.6
4392475,5,B004K4FUWA,"both of us definitely had an enjoyable remembrance of a live performance 21 years ago in las vegas, will loan to friends.",1361404800,,121,4.545454545454546
4392476,4,B004K4FUWA,this movie is similar to the play version.  there are a few songs that are not included in the film version.  bought primarly for research for the play that we were producing,1360454400,,174,4.40625
4392477,5,B004K4FUWA,"I saw the show (and enjoyed it), so I bought the DVD -- and enjoyed it.  The DVD does a pretty good job of capturing the live performance.  Great music (mostly standards from the 1940a an 1950s), flawlessly performed, very upbeat.  A lot of fun!  As with so many musicals, the plot is VERY thin -- just enough to hold the songs together.  And it is a variation of the standard movie musical plot:  ""Let's get together and put on a show!""  But you are there for the music; the chatter between numbers holds it together and can be humorous.",1354060800,,538,4.32
4392478,5,B004K4FUWA,"Okay I am a FOREVER  PLAID fan!  The show ran forever in Las Vegas, first at the FLAMINGO then at the GOLD COAST...and I've seen FOREVER PLAID 8 times!
Now the performance is on DVD  (I would have really wanted to see the LAS VEGAS cast in DVD, but every actor I had seen in this show was terrific, funny and bitter-sweet.  Thanks to the Producing company who transfered the show to DVD to preserve it forever;  You know,FOREVER PLAID has  a small cast, but has a big heart...Oh yeah, the piantist not only supplied the music but he was a vital part of the show and added a lot of inter play with the cast and audience!
One minor flaw...the entire PERRY COMO segment had been edited from the DVD.  It is a nice part of the script, and I'm sorry that it was cut.
If you are a Broadway fan and love live performances filmed on Stage, buy this DVD.  But then I'm sure you already own it!  TERI",1346284800,,890,4.157894736842105
4392479,5,B004K4FUWA,"I love this movie.
My friend asked me to watch it with him. I wasn't expecting much but was blown away by the four part harmony.
If you like music from the 40s and 50s you'll like this stage performance.
The second time through was as good as the first. It brought tears to my eyes both times.
I really could listen to these guys all day long.",1341360000,,343,4.0588235294117645
4392480,5,B004K4FUWA,"I have been a part of the Forever Plaid family since the year 2000 when I did my first appearance as Smudge. Since then, I have done the show 3 times. The last one closed yesterday! What a great little show. Unfortunately, no theater show translates well to video. However, I am PLAID at heart. And having performed the show so many times and seen it many times as well, I love this video! It is not exactly like the original show, but if you have seen the show before, then you will definitely be entertained.",1333324800,,510,4.322916666666667
4392481,4,B004K4FUWA,The Vegas Show was so much better when Mr. Ewing was there. But since the show was removed from Vegas this is a good distraction.,1329264000,,129,4.2
4392482,4,B004K4FUWA,"Translates great from stage to screen but am  very disappointed that they left out the entire Perry Como tribute. I've seen the live show many times and love it each time; now I can spend time at home reliveing the fun, except for the deleted portion.",1325980800,4,251,4.456521739130435
4392483,5,B004K4FUWA,"Steller performance, nostalgic American behavior and atmosphere coupled with stratospheric music, a 'must hear' and 'see'. This is an investment in uplifted souls, your audience will be improved and refreshed!...",1324684800,,212,6.1
4392484,5,B004K4FUWA,I had seen this movie in the theater and purchased it so that I can enjoy it time and time again. Very entertaining.,1322179200,,116,4.086956521739131
4392485,5,B004K4FUWA,"I had no problems receiving in a timely manner.  It's a Xmas gift for someone else, so I haven't watched it.",1319932800,,108,4.142857142857143
4392486,5,B004K4FUWA,"I've been Forever Plaid waiting for the movie ""Forever Plaid""  I've seen the play in Texas twice and in California once.  I was going to see it again three weeks ago in Arlington, TX. But for the same amount of the price of a ticket, I purchased the movie instead.  And you know what?  It's just as good as in seeing it in person.  I highly recommend this movie and the people I purchased it from.
They were very expedient and Plaidfantastic!",1319760000,,442,4.341463414634147
4392487,3,B004K4FUWA,"I can understand how seeing Forever Plaid in a live theatre setting would be much better than watching it at home on tv. In a theatre with other people, little things become funnier when everyone else is laughing, but at home--not so much. The show was very clean, which I appreciated. Most of the old songs were not my favorites--but they're very probably someone else's. The guys were sweet and charming. I expected more of a plot but it was actually a concert. It was okay to watch once but I don't feel the urge to watch it again.",1318636800,,534,4.404040404040404
4392488,5,B004K4FUWA,"To be honest, we had never heard of Forever Plaid. It was brought to our attention by Daniel Reichard (Frankie). We have seen Daniel Reichard perform 21 times in the role of Bob Gaudio in the Broadway Show Jersey Boys  and currently (8 times) in the National Tour of THE MIDTOWN MEN and admire his work and wanted to see more of his artistic talents.
 Other than the trailer we had no idea what to expect from this production.  Much to our great pleasure, we thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the harmony of the four men, and seeing Daniel perform in another role. For those of you who remember The Ed Sullivan Show, you will just love their rendition of that Sunday night show. You will be amazed that Heart & Soul has so many lyrics... I was.
If you enjoy musical talent, this is well worth it to add to your ""repertoire"".",1318118400,2,820,4.381578947368421
4392489,5,B004K4FUWA,"I was already a fan of Forever Plaid, and I was thrilled to hear that it would be released on DVD. The four part harmonies are absolutely beautiful, and the actors exude enormous talent and irresistible charm.

This is a show that doesn't rely on the use of elaborate sets or crazy special effects simply because it doesn't need to. It's pretty amazing that a show that features four men on the same stage for an hour and a half can be so wildly successful and just so captivating.

The show translates perfectly to the big screen because it isn't altered in any way. And it shouldn't be! With its innocent humor and gorgeous music, Forever Plaid is a wonderful show, and I think it's one of the only ""musicals"" that is as just as fun to watch live as it is to watch on DVD. My only complaint is that one of my favorite songs, ""Catch a Falling Star"", is missing!

I'm so glad Forever Plaid is on DVD. I can't stop watching it; it never fails to put me in a good mood. If you're a fan of the show, or love four part harmonies, or if you want to see a charming story with beautiful music, then order this. Whether you've seen the show before or not, you won't be disappointed.",1317254400,8,1174,4.232142857142857
4392490,5,B004K4FUWA,I saw the play many years ago and was looking forward to the release of the DVD for a long time. I'm not disappointed!  Absolutely love the 4-part harmonies. This is one DVD I will watch over and over again.,1317081600,3,207,4.175

8432248,3,B004K4FUWA,"I LOVE Forever Plaid. I worked at a theatre that ran this show for a few months so I have fond memories of these songs. With that said, the recording is OK. I wasn't wowed or anything.",1484179200,,184,4.0

8432250,5,B004K4FUWA,"Before Jersey Boys, there was this delightful musical. After seeing it live many times I was so happy to see it get a film treatment with the original Broadway cast. The next best thing to seeing it live. Great cast and soundtrack.",1475107200,,231,4.523809523809524
