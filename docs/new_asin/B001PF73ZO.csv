8333234,1,B001PF73ZO,"This DVD is awful.  The video quality is terrible.  Anytime anything moves, huge blocky artifacts appear on screen.  The entire documentary looks like it was shot on a CELL PHONE CAMERA and then burned onto DVD.  I'm not joking - it's that bad.

I wasn't hoping for anything great.  Just some nice Korean footage I could show with the volume off - but the video quality is so atrocious that I can't even use it for that.

Save your money and stay away from this DVD.",1291852800,,466,4.348837209302325
8333235,5,B001PF73ZO,"We acquired this movie in support of a young man deployed and stationed in South Korea.

Upon learning that Michael would be soon leaving us to travel to this beautiful country, we decided to acquire the DVD to learn where he would be spending the next year of his life.

We are glad to have shared this experience, we learned much about the country, its people, folkloric dance, foods and religion.

If you plan to travel to South Korea or want to learn about this country, then this DVD is an excellent choice.",1267056000,3,512,4.483870967741935
8333236,4,B001PF73ZO,"The locations, scenery, history and information are good, however, if you travel to Korea, don't make the mistake of copying the horrible pronunciations used in this video. This isn't the first time I have noticed that the British seem to refuse to learn how to properly pronounce anything foreign. One would think that if you are making a travel video about another country, you would do them the honor of a little research. I took one star off my recommendation just for that.",1252713600,,478,4.771084337349397
