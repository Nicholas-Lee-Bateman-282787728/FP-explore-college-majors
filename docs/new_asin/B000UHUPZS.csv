I was born in 1965 but have always loved JFK and the whole Camelot era, the fact that an articulate, fresh and forward-thinking/looking politician could actually be elected President of the United States was stunning (I am not American).
Then there's the whole tragedy of Kennedy being cut down before he had the chance to make real changes and one's that would last - I'm not of the Republican persuasion but I am a great admirer of Robert S MacNamara who said that 'had he lived' then it would have been a very different world today - for the better.
In some ways, I think the tragedy of JFK is his greatest stregth, the fact that he was cut down in the prime of his presidency means that he left the promise of what could have been achieved and something for later generations to aspire to, hopefully something that will inspire Barack Obama to greatness (he's a great admirer of Lincoln which is a good start in my book and read him in the lead up to the inaguration which means he's not just saying it).
On the other side, if Kennedy had lived he would either have been great or would have disappointed in some ways as he had such an ambitious agenda that he may not have achieved anything and it would have taken generations (like Lincoln) for him to be truly appreciated.
Get this if you like JFK, it's short but it is an interesting treatment of what drove Kennedy the man and the presidency.",1242086400,,1502,4.406474820143885
8213313,5,B000UHUPZS,"John F. Kennedy: Spokesman for the New Century is a refreshing portrait of a president whose legacy has far too long been trivialized in the public eye.  There is so much more to remember about John F. Kennedy, the president, than his charisma and his assassination.

This documentary DVD lives up to its seemingly paradoxical title.  Even in the early 1960s, before his life and leadership were cut short, Kennedy offered a vision that has only become more accurate and urgent with the passage of time.  As we find ourselves in ever escalating tumult overseas and at home, it's worth asking:  What would Kennedy say, do, advise, if he could be here with us today?

John F. Kennedy:  Spokesman for the New Century is a timely response to that question, and one that should not be overlooked.",1186272000,10,791,4.7299270072992705
