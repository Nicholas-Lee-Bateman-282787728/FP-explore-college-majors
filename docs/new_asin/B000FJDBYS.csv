It's very informative, has dozens of trick of the trade, the restoration of the bible had such lovely results. A True asset to your DVD collection. I brought first a personal edition, and then another one for our local craft club library.",1151884800,,338,4.65

It is an act of great commercial courage by Ms Heffernan to tackle a subject as obscure as bookbinding. Having said this it is a great gift to posterity to have the work of a master craftsman recorded for the coming generations when the taking of apprentices in this craft has almost died out.

In another 2 generations or so nobody will know how to restore old boooks to their original condition which I think is a great shame on our society.

Not only is the video fascinating to watch but the work is indeed done step by step and it is indeed possible using this tool to actually restore a large leather bound book. Quite amazing. I thank Ms Heffernnan for providing this link between the past and the future and hope to see copies in the libraries of institutes of learning all over the world where they deserve to reside. Last year I used this video as my Christmas gift standard and it met with great enthusiasm.",1146614400,,1018,4.404255319148936
