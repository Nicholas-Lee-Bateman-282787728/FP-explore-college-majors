7333431,3,B011IX6ZC4,"Ok, so first and far most I want to make clear that I did not purchase the product from this PARTICULAR VENDOR, I purchased mine off of eBay a few years ago. It is the exact same product for the exact same price (who knows this may be the same vendor just moved to Amazon now). Now let me also just state that sadly, THERE IS NO OFFICIAL COMPLETE DVD and or BLU-RAY BOX SET COLLECTION AVAILABLE OR SOLD IN THE US, keep that in mind when considering purchasing this product.

Now on to the actual product:

The Cover box: The box is surprisingly beautiful and feels pretty thick and sturdy. Sailor Moon herself along with the ""SAILOR MOON"" title on the box has a holographic effect, as does the red border of every text printed on the front cover. At first glance I was shocked to see that it looked like a lot of time went into the design of the cover box. The back however, does not have any effect and instead is cluttered with the summary of each season in English (in white) and in Japanese (in Orange). The print is incredibly tiny and is an assault on the eyes.

The actual box: The box itself sports the same design as the cover except not shiny or anything special. It is a generic box with a print of the cover art inserted into the transparent slip as most DVDs. The back has the same description as the cover box but only now tinier (if you can believe it). Its basically just a smaller version of the box cover.

The inside contents: Now at this point when I opened the box, this is when I knew I had gotten what I had paid for. It was going so good up until I opened it. The DVDs are housed inside flimsy and thin sleeves (2 DVDs per sleeve: one in front one in back), but hey, they did the job and kept my DVDs from getting damaged. There were more  sleeve slots then there were DVDs. There is no box art inside, just plain white plastic on plain white sleeves.

The DVDs: There are 9 DVDs total. Why? I don't know. They are also very confusing to figure out the order should you mix them around, so I recommend when you finish with a DVD put it back in the exact spot you took it from . The quality of the images on the DVDs themselves are somewhat blurry. Its clear that it was manufactured in some kind of factory and not done with an ""at home CD label makers"" (so that's a plus), but still you can tell the images are generic images found in Google and have nothing to do with the actual season its printed on. (As a matter of fact one of the images is not even centered and the text that goes around the DVD gets cut off. *see pic*).
The most confusing part about it, which actually threw me for a loop, was figuring out just what order these things went in. The first DVD says ""Sailor Moon R, disk 1, chapter 1-23"", which doesn't make sense because that is actually the name of season 2. The first season is just called ""Sailor Moon"" (as it states on the back of the box). So upon inspection, there was no DVD marked ""Sailor Moon"". So I looked for the DVD that marked the beginning of the ACTUAL season 2, instead i found that the DVDs went up to ""Sailor Moon R, disk 4, chapter 70-89). So it appears season one and season two were combined. The rest of the DVDs were not as confusing to figure out. Sailor Moon S and Sailor Moon SuperS both have 2 DVDs each, each with about 38-39 eps. Sailor Moon Sailor Stars only have 1 DVD with 34 eps.

The Visual Quality of the DVDs: I am going to be completely honest, the quality is absolutely terrible BY TODAYS STANDARDS! That said, if you were born in the age of HD and Blu-Ray and never knew the struggle of antennas and manually rewinding VHSs , this is not the product for you. However, if you grew up watching your cartoons on a standard TV with avg audio, you may still enjoy the DVDs. The quality is that of a VHS, lacking but still enjoyable, fully functional and comprehendible. The aspect ratio is 4:3, so regardless how big your HD TV is, you will still get the visuals of a box TV.

The Audio: The audio is low, but with that great HD-TV of yours, making it louder is as simple as raising the volume. Its not crisp and clear like Blu-Ray, it literally sounds like you're watching your old box TV, which didn't really bother me since I only recently upgraded to HDTV. The only part that really got under my skin and almost made me return it was when the audio would fall out of line with the show. For a few seconds the audio was either too ahead or too far behind. This wasn't common, most times I had to rewind it to double check if it was me or if it was the DVD. Now I will say that in one particular episode(sailor moon super s ""The Secret Of Pegasus""), it was REALLY bad, almost unwatchable bad, and lasted longer than a few seconds. ). Luckily it didn't last the whole episode (just happened to occur during my favorite part!)

THE DEAL BREAKER FOR SOME: The DVDs do NOT COME WITH ENGLISH DUB (except Sailor Moon SuperS) The subtitle aren't pretty to look at, its yellow and blocky but does the job of letting you know whats being said. If you're a seasoned Anime watcher, then this shouldn't really pose as a problem for you. The speed at which they display is average, so you shouldn't have time hard time keeping up.

ANOTHER DEAL BREAKER FOR SOME: THIS IS NOT THE AMERICAN RELEASE OF SAILOR MOON, meaning IF YOU ARE OFFENDED BY SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS, CARTOON BREAST AND UNDERWEAR, SEXUAL INNUENDOS, CROSS DRESSING/ TRANSGENDER, AND SWEAR WORDS, THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT FOR YOU!!! The American release cut out all that stuff when they aired it in America. This is NOT STRICTLY FOR ADULTS, but in Japan, it is not taboo to include these topics. They are part of everyday life and not seen as something that children should particularly be sheltered from. Its just a cultural difference. The swear words are not too bad, and I think they are said only twice in the whole series. Underwear shots and cleavage shot are widely incorporated in all Anime, so its no difference here. The sexual innuendos usually take place between two of the sailor scouts, which in the Japanese version are an actual couple (in American release they are cousins). ***SPOILER ALERT TO SEASON 5*** The cross dressing/ Transgender topic occurs in the last season (which was never aired or sold in the US for that reason until recently) where the Starlights are Males in suites that can transform into Females (in skimpier outfits) It shows the entire transformation from male pecks to a more ""female curve"" no nipples are ever exposed. And finally, one of the Sailor Starlights becomes attracted to Sailor Moon in her male form.(see pic *i am not the creator nor do i own that photo in any way. image source:[...] )

Final Thoughts: Lets all be real here. Most people considering this product are huge Sailor Moon fans who want the satisfaction of knowing they own every single episode, but are you willing to pay? The only other way to own it all is to track down each and every season (which is sometimes broken up into two parts) and shell out about $20-$50 a pop (depending on blu-ray and special editions). If you want to just be able to whip out a DVD and watch your favorite episode, if you just want it to brag that you have it, or if you just want it for nostalgic reason, you really will not find a better deal anywhere else. Mainly because there are no official Sailor Moon Complete Series Box Sets sold in America. Even if there was, you can rest assure it will be upwards of $200 for the same content just better quality. If quality is your thing, then no, you will be very disappointed with this product. But if you just want to enjoy Sailor Moon whenever you want and not have to worry about when they are going to take it down from HULU, then sure, $50 isn't bad, so to those people I would recommend it.

8724370,1,B011IX6ZC4,"Absolute crap...

The skipping on these DVDs was just beyond the average blips. For example, key parts in the plot line were completely skipped over as if the discs themselves were terribly scratched from being over-watched when absolutely no scratches were visible. I tried playing them on various mediums to see if it was a problem on my end, but the same results came back every time. I have a collection of old anime DVDs as VHSs, but this sort of thing was clearly an error in quality. Bad translations as well as pixelation is typical but skipping full scenes? I don't accept that.

I'd intended to treat a young anime fan to watching the whole Sailor Moon series with this, but it would in no way work for this since it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to understand what the heck is going on with the amount of skipping that is going on. You don't know who Naru is in the first episode, you miss Usagi's interlude with Tux and much of Luna's speech to Usagi about her purpose is skipped over. These are large chunks that SHOULD be in there so a young fan can understand what's going on. The first episode is not the only one with problems either; it's consistently terrible throughout the discs. The end of the first season, being such an important part of the whole series, was so butchered I went straight to the seller to let them know it was obviously defective.

The seller, after nearly ONE YEAR has not resolved the issue. Promises of a new set have never gone through and I was never offered a refund. I had such high hopes for this product and it's heartbreaking to think a youngster could've had this sorry excuse for a Sailor Moon set as their introduction to the series. What a shame. I'm now stuck with a bunch of discs that are basically expensive paperweights.",1483574400,,1774,4.503105590062112
8724371,3,B011IX6ZC4,"First series and sailor moon r are tv quality. Also all the subs are cut so you are required to know Japanese. The rest of the series has dvd quality and great subs.

The box is beautiful I just love the details they put into it. At first the order of the movies was confusing to understand but nothing too bad. I was a little worried about most the movies r in Japanese but it's actually really easy to follow. The very first season was a Lil fuzzy but other then that the rest play great!!!
