7544225,5,B018AXRNL2,"Its such a delight hearing the English cast back! I""m pretty sure this OVA was around youtube for sub for like years, and i was going to watch it like that BUT since i read the announcement of English dub, I waited ^_^. This came out after the Utawarerumono: False Masks sequel ended. not too long ago. On the CrunchyRoll website( Which I enjoyed and everyone should check it out). I wonder if Sentai Filmworks would dub the sequel too. ;) That way John Gremillon comes back to dub Hakuoro in the Final Adaption of Utwawarerumono.",1461110400,,530,4.53125
7544226,5,B018AXRNL2,"First of all I would like to state that you should only purchase this if you watched the complete and original series of Utawarerumono. That being said this is a OVA set that is a combination of three Side Stories told in 30 minute episodes that tie into the original series included with them are also picture dramas that also tie in.

Now one thing to remember or be aware of is that this set is actually re-release of a OVA series that was ironically available only in Japan and was available for a very limited time I believe in the mid-2000s.

The animation is slightly better than the original series however there are only certain moments where you will notice the rather well animated backgrounds and characters and you can certainly tell the difference in animation between the original series and this one.

All of the original voice actors from the original series return and voice their respective characters however if you are getting this set don't expect the same kind of story setting from the previous series.

This OVA set is one that I have personally been wanting for quite a few years now and I pre-ordered it the moment I found out that it was going to be released in the West. The reason for its release ironically is because the series itself was renewed with a spin-off series currently running or having recently finished in Japan which most likely will get its own dub warranting this set.

Now the animation is good the sound is nice and honestly if you are a fan of the original show and anime or if you played the actual game on the computer either version mind you, then this will most likely Delight you having slightly improved animation very nice sound quality and returning characters and voice actors.

My only real complaint is that there appeared to be a couple of smaller episodes that were part of the Japanese OVA that ran only about 3 to 6 minutes long apiece and were more comedy than anything else and help to reveal more about certain individual characters.
Aside from small content that I had hoped to see released in the west this is of course common that's some episodes are parts of individual animes we do not receive.

The bottom line is from my perspective if you are a fan of the anime then this is well worth the money, however if you are unfamiliar with the series then this is most likely a pass. Also I would like to point out that I have the DVD version as the original series was never released on Blu-ray so I purchased this with the intention of having it paired up with the original DVD set itself.",1460592000,5,2560,4.504310344827586
7544227,4,B018AXRNL2,The story was good but could have done better. Most of the voice actor came back. The artwork on the other hand. It was not the best. They could have done much better!!,1460592000,,168,4.121212121212121

8741935,4,B018AXRNL2,"The four stars is entirely for the content itself. If I were to base on the price, definitely not worth the price to get 3 episodes. Only buy if you're a big fan of the series like I am.",1500508800,,186,3.7948717948717947
8741936,5,B018AXRNL2,"This is a nice OVA to sit back and chill while watching. If you already saw the 1st season of Utawarerumono anime, then this DVD will be a nice compliment to it. Warning: contains sudden nudity (something not in the anime season) which immediatly bumps the rating to Mature 17+.",1482192000,,278,4.58

8741940,4,B018AXRNL2,"A ova series fillers.
If you like fan-service materials or fillers you might just like this ova set
I enjoy to kill time with ova sets.
It's a ova set which should've been originally with the complete season one.
But if you had the series and  / seen it and liked the series .
You might find this laid back set of OVAS
Enjoyable.",1465171200,,329,4.140625
8741941,1,B018AXRNL2,"Its the worst DVD that I ever order is money waisted . I do have the first one and is just wonderful every so often I watch it again the characters
are just great and I always wished that would continue with the story than came U false faces it just did not hit home at all.then this Ova came out
I got it because I thought it has some closure to the original its so stupid or maybe I was for gettingit. well any way thats my opinion.
If someone got it I would love to hear what they think.
