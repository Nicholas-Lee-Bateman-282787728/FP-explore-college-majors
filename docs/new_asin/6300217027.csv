He finds Kim Darby in college and takes her away from her yuppie boyfriend. He ends up in the wrestling game after meeting Herve Villechaize,another star in the making. ""The One and Only"" pokes fun at pro wrestling with out going over the top.",1223510400,6,420,4.2625

The reason it deserves a five-star grade is probably the best quote I've ever seen in any movie. There's this scene where his agent is trying to teach the main character (Winkler) some sense and he goes: Look, there are two kinds of people in this world: there are people who put the lamp- shades on lamps and the others who put the lamp-shades on their heads.

There are the hillarious challenges of him having to explain not only to his wife, but also to his inlaws, the nature of his employment.

261745,4,6300217027,Great movie. Saw it as a kid and it still holds up. A very loose hollywood adaptation of the story of Gorgeous George,1431648000,,117,4.130434782608695

261747,2,6300217027,"I remember liking this movie as a kid--but that was a long time ago back when Henry Winkler was still considered a potential movie star.  Winkler plays Andy Schmidt, a young man with an outsized ego that convinces him he will inevitably be a huge star even though he shows no apparent talent for acting or singing or for anything really beyond self-promotion.  Andy Schmidt comes across as a wildly unlikable narcissist in need of psychiatric attention.  Henry Winkler lacks the acting chops or charisma to make his character funny or likable.

He marries a way too good for him coed named Mary (Kim Darby--like Winkler looking way too old to be a college student) against her parents wishes.  They move to a dive apartment in  New York, Andy refuses to get a job always convinced that his next audition will be his big break and then Mary becomes pregnant.  Andy has the good fortune to run into a midget actor named Milton (Herv Villechaize) who introduces him to an agent involved with professional wrestling.

Henry Winkler clearly doesn't have the body to play a believable wrestler but the movie acknowledges that.  The one thing that most shocked me about seeing The One and Only after all these years is that I really didn't remember how talented a comic actor Herv Villechaize was--the movie improves fantastically almost as soon as he is onscreen.  A scene that basically consists of Milton sitting next to Andy's mother-in-law on a small sofa provides the movies biggest laughs with little more than Villechaize's lecherous facial expressions.

Henry Winkler's character is unfunny and unbearable until the scenes in the wrestling ring--it turns out that professional wrestling is the perfect outlet for his look-at-me personality.  The wrestling scenes in The One and Only are genuinely fun and amusing--but there aren't enough of them to save the film.  The One and Only ends up wasting way too much time in the build-up to Andy becoming a professional wrestler and not nearly enough on the part of the movie that actually works--just when I was ready to upgrade my opinion of The One and Only the end credits came up unexpectedly, ending the movie just when it seemed to be getting much better.

Henry Winkler was a supporting character on Happy Days and made a good career for himself as a character actor in films like Scream and The Waterboy and on television shows like Arrested Development and Childrens Hospital--but Henry Winkler was never an effective lead on television or in the movies.  The One and Only likely would have been improved with a stronger actor in the lead--when I picture Michael Keaton in this it immediately seems much funnier.  The One and Only is genuinely painful to sit through in the first half when Henry Winkler is expected to completely carry the film but gets better if you have the patience to get to the wrestling scenes.  It's definitely not a movie I would recommend or ever want to sit through again although I can say this in its favor--The One and Only is a lot easier to endure than Heroes which came out the previous year and was Winkler's first stab at movie stardom.  After The One and Only Henry Winkler was only top-billed in one more theatrical film, Night Shift, which was directed by his Happy Days cast-mate Ron Howard.  Night Shift made supporting actor Michael Keaton a star seemingly overnight and transformed Ron Howard into a viable Hollywood director but it did nothing for Henry Winkler besides demonstrating again that some actors are not meant to be leads.",1429747200,,3532,4.817880794701987
261748,5,6300217027,"This is a wonderful comedy that spoofs pro wrestling.  Actually, it reveals the secret behind any successful pro wrestler, find a persona and act the part very well.  Henry Winkler does that.",1426982400,,191,4.9375
261749,5,6300217027,"I forgot how much I enjoyed this movie when it first came out. Like many other Car Reiner films, this holds up well and stands the test of time. A great cast which supports Winkler's skill very well. I always had a crush on Kim Darby so I'm a little prejudice, but I think she was a perfect choice for the role as the love interest. All in all, the entertainment value is still there.",1425168000,,384,4.133333333333334

261751,4,6300217027,"I've been curious about this movie for years and finally got a copy on Christmas after years of it never being available on DVD. I've always loved Arthur (1981), written and directed by Steve Gordon. Arthur's dialogue is about as sharp as you can get and so I've always been curious about Gordon's other work. Unfortunately Gordon died at 44 of a heart attack not long after marking Arthur and so there was never a follow-up. Besides some hard to find TV work, The One and Only (1978) was Gordon's only other produced work, directed by comedy legend Carl Reiner.

The One and Only isn't as sharp as Arthur but it is still very sharp and funny. Henry Winkler, in the middle of his years as the Fonz, plays Andy Schmidt, perhaps the most narcissistic film character in history. A wannabe actor/entertainer, he's an unlikable character completely convinced that he's the most likable guy in the world. He's an aggressive smart alec and really you can only hang with him for the first act because his wisecracks frequently are hilarious. Kim Darby plays his girlfriend Mary Crawford, a fellow college student who basically is with Andy because he makes her laugh.

When they graduate from an Ohio college they move to New York where Andy becomes a hopeless unemployed actor who never loses his confidence that he is extremely talented and going to be a big star. And of course he goes on to be a big star in the world of professional wrestling. And there's also some personal growth, I guess you can't have a comedy without personal growth.

The movie is consistently fun, Steve Gordon showed he could write one-liners as good as anyone in the world, though some lines feel a little ugly and mean, particularly a character who's dialogue is mostly homophobic jokes about his gay son. It's a shame we didn't get another 30 years of Gordon written comedies, I'm sure quite a few classics went unmade.",1419897600,,1894,4.698795180722891

261765,5,6300217027,"I have loved this movie for ages. It is a silly but humorous comedy which has at its core a solid love story  with associated tolerance until.... A struggle between who he wants to be (how he sees himself) and what he has to be. A story of sacrifice of a dream in order to meet the current necessities.
Having grown up as a fan of professional wrestling, I found this comedic parody refreshing and funny. Well acted by all of the principles with exceptional performances by Herv Villechaize and Kim Darby who brings out the best in Winklers character.

261772,2,6300217027,"Steve Gordon wrote and directed one of my favorite films of all time in ""Arthur"" (1981). As his only other writing credit, I was hoping this was a hidden gem, and eagerly purchased it. Not only was Gordon behind it, but it stars Henry Winkler and was directed by Carl Reiner- and the plot would at least sound compelling! I wanted so badly to fall in love with it, but I couldn't. The protagonist will frustrate you, the humor will fall flat, and if you've seen Arthur, you'll wonder how the same mind could have dreamt this one up.

That being said, go watch Arthur (the original, with Dudley Moore- not the Russell Brand remake). I've never met someone who didn't enjoy it.",1361577600,,675,4.487804878048781

261809,4,6300217027,"When I had learned that it was the legendary ""Gorgeous George"" (George Raymond Wagner, 1915-1963) and his wife Betty who inspired those behind this movie, I was very eager to acquire and view this sweet little film on DVD. Well, the model that Gorgeous George set for the title role of Andy Schmidt (played by Henry Winkler) in ""The One and Only"" (which is what Andy likes to call himself, in the ring or in any other entertainment venue) is far removed in details from the real Gorgeous George. Andy is an eccentric fake as a wrestler, physically unfit for genuine wrestling; Gorgeous George, on the other hand, while not particularly imposing as a ring athlete, was, indeed, a skillful wrestler as well as a very amusing showman.

My familiarity with Gorgeous George`s way of professional fighting comes from the years of seeing him in the ring when my family (parents, siblings, and, on other occasions, my paternal step-grandfather, too) used to watch Gorgeous George on TV during the late 1940s onward. The film only approximates that milieu, but it is very amusing on its own terms.

Gorgeous George`s first wife Betty was a publically visible (and very pretty) part of his public persona, but Mary Crawford, Betty`s parallel in the film (played by Kim Darby) is shy, retiring, and of rather homely looks, rather than the publically visible companion to a celebrity wrestler as Gorgeous George`s lovely wife (ne Betty Hanson) had been to some extent. Darby`s performance in the film, however, is almost as comical as Winkler`s, so, cinematically, it does not matter that much, does it? Andy`s trainer, the hilarious and philandering midget, Milton Miller (himself, in the film, a comedy wrestler, played by the diminuitive actor and painter, Herv Villachaize) ""steals the show"" grandly, surely the funniest actor in this talented cast! The scene in which Milton flirts seductively and with grotesque inappropriety with Mary`s genteel mother, who finds the dwarf`s attentions utterly revolting, while both of Mary`s parents are visiting the young couple, is the single most side-splitting scene in what is withal a very hilarious film.

There certainly is room for a genuine bio-film on Gorgeous George, the memory of whose career deserves to be honoured in that way, but for those who have any liking for wrestling (and I have to admit that my own interest only centred narrowly on Gorgeous George, a man of real class, however amusing, the others leaving me indifferent, especially the ring buffoons who came after him) and who have a strong hankering for film comedy (which I like a lot more widely!), this movie will likely be in their video machines rather often! It would have been desirable to include some ""extra features"" for this product (Legend Films LR-00210, as available in the U. S. of A. and Canada) that would make the background to ""The One and Only"" clearer to viewers too young to recall George Wagner, but, naturally, it is the motion picture itself that determines most buyer`s decision to purchase or to pass by on. It is the absense of special features on the DVD that results in the review`s rating of four rather than in five stars, but I still say, buy it and savour it!",1353369600,,3202,4.893186003683241
261810,5,6300217027,"This movie is one of my favorites!  Henry Winkler is a likeable actor with a huge ego married to timid, sweet Kim Darby in the early 50's, struggling in NYC.  Unable to get work as an actor, he stumbles into the wild, wacky world of professional wrestling and the rest if wild mahem.  The stiff, conservative parents of the bride add a nice comic touch and the almost unbelievable romance between the two opposites in Darby and Winkler are really funny and strangely believable.  Early in the film she says, ""I guess I'll have to marry you, I'm too embarrassed to date you.""  A very funny, wonderful cast, too.  A must see!",1326758400,,623,4.517857142857143

You will really appreciate the acting talent of Henry Winkler (The Fonz from Happy Days) as well as enjoy watching Herv Villechaize (Tattoo from Fantasy Island) work his magic with the ladies!

Basically, The Fonz is an over the top dreamer and always thinks he's going to make it big as a movie star but the only paying gig he can get is professional wrestler. Along the way he gets married and has a child. His father and mother-in-law ain't thrilled with him or his wrestling friends.

Even if you hate professional wrestling this is a movie that you and a wrestling fan can both enjoy. It's a wrestling ring wrapped around a comedic chick flick.",1302480000,,859,4.529032258064516

261813,4,6300217027,"In addition to the delightful comic performances of Henry Winkler, Kim Darby, Gene Saks and the rest of the cast, this film is notable for being the last major English language recording by Kvitka Cisyk.  Cisyk (billed as Kasey Cisyk in the credits) was an unknown backup and commercial jingle singer when she was hired by Joe Brooks to dub Didi Conn's vocals in his movie, ""You Light Up My Life.""  It was her beautiful rendition of the title song that filmgoers fell in love with, but Brooks chose Pat Boone's daughter Debbie to record the single version, so Boone got all the attention and the airplay (plus a Gold Record).  Cisyk can be heard on the complete soundtrack album but most people still credit Debbie Boone.  Director Carl Reiner properly recognized Cisyk's contribution to that hugely successful song and hired her to sing the title song in ""The One and Only.""  She was a beautiful singer who, tragically, died of breast cancer in 1998, leaving behind two gorgeous CD collections of Ukrainian folk songs. She was a great singer who never got the recognition she deserved.",1284508800,3,1086,4.786096256684492
261814,5,6300217027,"This a film that definitely deserves revisiting.  I saw it as a kid and was put off by the apparently obnoxious character, Andy Schmidt, played by Henry Winkler.  Apparently a lot of people were as well because it received a lukewarm critical and commercial response.  You could almost say it put a fork in Henry Winkler's nascent film career.  Give Winkler credit though for trying to put distance between his ""Happy Days"" character and his big-screen persona.  His previous cinematic effort was in ""Heroes"" where he played a troubled Vietnam vet.  Give Winkler kudos here for tackling a potentially unlikable role and by the film's end not only do you gain empathy for him you find yourself rooting for him to succeed.  The film is also blessed with an impeccable supporting cast.  Everybody here should be praised but special mention should be given to Gene Saks as a harried wrestling promoter and Herve Villechaize as a randy midget wrestler.  The script is by the late Steve Gordon who later achieved acclaim by profiling another potentially unlikable character in ""Arthur"".  Carl Reiner helms the film with an assured comic hand and perfectly captures the Fifties milieu which is a far cry from Arnold's Restaurant.  ""The One and Only"" deserves classic stature if enough people are willing to invest the time in it.",1272758400,2,1322,4.9366515837104075

With Carl Reiner in tandem as director (before he hit it big time with Steve Martin's early films) I was hopeful for a very funny movie in ""The One & Only"".

Sadly while it has some memorable moments and sketches, the film is very variable and very up and down in the laughs department. The key comedy concept of an actor making it to fame by turning to ""acting"" as a professional wrestler is slow to be reached and sadly the wrestling part of the film is most funny when the manager of the wrestlers is on screen rather than the in ring antics of the wrestlers.
