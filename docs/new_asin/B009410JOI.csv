5256744,5,B009410JOI,"In the essay by San Francisco Chronicle music journalist Joel Selvin which accompanies some great Doobie Brother memorabilia in the 8-page booklet inserted the BD case, Selvin refers to this 99-minute film as both a ""sprawling documentary"" and a ""scrapbook"", both terms that I think accurately describe the centerpiece of this DVD and Bluray package. When original DB member Pat Simmons discovered a trove of old videos spanning 40 years in his house, he - and the remaining DBs provided them to filmmaker Barry Ehrmann to create the film.

I'll admit up front that I have always liked the DBs but I was never a rabid fan and knew little about them other than what I heard on the radio. But, after watching this thoroughly enjoyable film, I know a lot more. And the snippets of songs I heard - there are no full performances in the film (how could there be? - they produced way too many hits) but nine are included as bonus tracks - brought back a lot of memories. All the important folks are here in open, and in depth, interviews. All the living members (four have died over the years) of the band, their manager (of 40 years!) Bruce Cohn and Producer Ted Templeman. Unlike many of these ""story of"" documentaries, it's not loaded with comments from music journalists or biographers. There's only one and, honestly, I forget his name and I'm not sure he adds much except from a fan's perspective.

The footage, both in the film and as part of the 43-minute ""bonus"" section, is not always the best lighted or sharpest but - if we are to believe Selvin's comment that much of this is being seen for the first time in years - it's certainly watchable. And, as the band sings in just one of their biggest hits, just ""listen to the music"". It's still great.

In 1982 when the band members decided it was time to quit for a while (actually only five years) they did it as friends and you hear no real animosity from any of them.

If you are DB devotee you may see this film from a different perspective and have some gripes. As for me, I found this both an insightful and entertaining film. Sure, five minutes before the end you hear the members promoting their latest album (and their new brand of wine - which benefits charities in the Bay Area), but the 94 minutes before that are (to excerpt another DB hit) ""just alright with me"".

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5256746,5,B009410JOI,"Yes I am a member of the Doobies fan club and have met them on many of occasions. This just tops off what I already know about the boys. It is fantastic with great films and scenes I haven't seen before. You can't just watch it once and put it down the first time. Believe it or not I had to watch it twice because there is always something you miss.
  If you think you know everything about them your wrong. I'm sure after seeing this we all still don't know everything, but this is really a great way to feel closer to understanding the truth behind them and what all happened throughout the years.",1354147200,11,600,4.208695652173913
5256747,3,B009410JOI,"I wanted to looove this rockumentary about the Doobie's but I was left with breadcrumbs instead of a whole loaf.  Over the past few years a couple of DVD'S chronicling The Who and Tom Petty were released.  These two releases were absolute knockouts!  They were expansive wonderfully detailed and highly entertaining stories behined two amazing bands.  The story of The Doobie Brothers clocks in at about an hour and a half and feels like a somewhat rushed overview of a band that I feel deserved a better treatment.  Things move along in swift chronological order dating back to when the band began playing in biker bars, none of this is elaborated on, it just lets the viewer know and moves on to the next topic.  When it comes to the making of the albums in the early seventies the viewer gets to see a clip hear and there of the band performing the hits but does not go into any detail about the conceptual ideas or studio footage or audience reaction to those classic albums.  Sure we get to here the boys talk about how excited they were when they first heard their songs on the radio, (how many times have we heard those kind of stories).  When the the story would go on to its next subject I would be thinking, that's it!  That's all their going to say about it!  The DVD also covers the late seventies Michael Mcdonald years, and once again its interesting but nothing most people don't already know.  This story just wasn't juicy enough for me.  Its a very good brief overview of a band if you are not to firmiliar with them but for those expecting full out documentary on the Doobie Brothers and their impact on popular music in the seventies will more than likely be a bit let down.  Eagle Rock is the best at these kind of releases,  I just hope the next item I purchase from them will leave me floored like so many of their other DVD'S have.",1353801600,5,1854,4.4147058823529415
5256748,4,B009410JOI,"As a fan of the Doobie Brothers, I enjoyed watching this documentary about the band's history.  I have all the other videos and DVDs of the Doobie Brothers, so there wasn't too much new information given in this DVD, but I enjoyed hearing the band members' personal accounts of their experiences.  I would have liked it more if the band members had given more details about their experiences on the tours and would have liked to have seen more footage of the band recording and playing.  There is some extra bonus footage of the band playing, but the video and sound quality of that extra footage is not good.  When Tom Johnston started talking about the new album, World Gone Crazy, I realized that the purpose of this DVD was to market and promote that album (which is a good album, but not as good as the Doobies' earlier albums).  I am glad that the Doobie Brothers took the time to tell their fans more about their history and how the band formed and changed over the years.  I hope they continue to tour and perform for many more years to come!  Anyone who is a fan of the Doobie Brothers should buy this DVD.  The DVD contains a lot of short video clips of the band members going back to the 70's and 80's, and it's a nice bit of nostalgia and fun.",1353715200,,1255,4.333333333333333
5256749,5,B009410JOI,"To be fair I just got into the Doobie's in the last year. Saw my first concert of theirs last month (it rocked). So my knowledge on this band is some what limited. So this release could not come at a better time. The two hour plus Blu ray gives a great overview of a band that has gone thru a lot of changes over the years. It interveiws just about everyone who is still alive that has been thru the band or worked with them in a significant role (such as Ted Templemen the producer of some of their best records). The thing that struck me was how at peace the band is with their history. In most Band's members of one era would be trying to take credit over members from another. But here Michael MacDonald seems very comfterble saying his period of the Doobie's is not the true Doobie's sound. Don't worry he gets his credit for saving the band when the thought they couldn't go on after Tom Johnston had to leave for health reasons (bleeding ulcer). It also does not treat the reunion years as an after thought like so many of these documentaries do. It takes you thru record by record. Over all I was very happy with this documentary.
 This disc also has about 45 minutes of live footage. I figured this would be from a current tour but it actually spans their career. It also has some of their biggest hits. Overall I could not be happier with this package.",1353024000,36,1362,4.27906976744186
5256750,5,B009410JOI,"Im very happy to have purchased this gem of a dvd, which also happens to be about my all-time favorite band!  Yes if I were stranded on an island and could only listen to one band, it would have to be the Doobies.  Why?  Youve got everything including folk, blues, country, funk, rock, jazz, AOR, ballads, bluegrass, and amazing instrumentals.  You also have some of the best  vocals, but really sets them apart (for me) is the GUITARS.  The first time I heard Listen to the Music (on vinyl) I was awestruck at how good the guitars sounded.  A perfect blend of strumming, finger-picking and lead.  This is a credit to their fantastic guitar players (Tom, Pat, Jeff, and later John) but its also a testament to the skills of super-producer Ted Templeman and his engineers.  Perfect sound.
Getting back to the band, it dawns on me why I always liked their music so much;  its just so natural and inclusive in nature.  Seeing them live bears this out as people from all walks of life show up and have a great time.  Every show is a celebration of life and humanity.  This dvd presents the band on a personal level so you get a real feel of what kind of people they are.  Aside from the professional differences, and there are a few, the focus is on the music and the fans.  The charitable work they continuously perform shows the kind of generosity that few bands exhibit.  It makes me want to buy many cases of their wine (proceeds go to charities).
One interesting note;  theres an interview with Pat where he talks about the first show (in Chicago) where Tom couldn't make it because he was so ill.  That was my very first concert and I remember being hugely disappointed.  I also remember the spokesperson telling the crowd that they could get a full refund (on their way out) but the band was ready to rock for those who wanted to stay.  WOW!  Im so glad we stuck around because the band was on fire!  Pat sang most of the lead parts and Skunk Baxter just tore his guitar apart!  Too bad theres no dvd of that show.
On a final note, BUY THIS DVD.

5256771,5,B009410JOI,"This is the 3rd Doobie Brothers video I have purchased and each one was made about 10 years apart. The content and quality of this one far surpasses the previous (2) and is a pleasure to see. What is different from the others is that this time its set up where the band and manager / producer tell the stories and not done like a music news show review. I was glad to see this time around Pat Simmons did (actually) most of the story telling, but also more talking this time from Tommy and even Tiran, Jeff Baxter, Mike McDonald and John McFee but there was no John Hartman this time. Plus its sad there are long time impact members no longer here - two drummers, Keith Knudsen and Michael Hossack are no longer with us this time. Several members who took part in the two previous videos have passed on and are given respects on the back cover as well as mentioned in the video. What is awesome this time is you get a bonus of about 10 or more live song videos from different eras. After owning the (2) previous videos I did not need this one but its nice to see they are still going strong , doing this for charities , fans , fun and can still earn a living in today's fickle music industry. That subject also comes up in a story about record promotion in later years. Very good all around video that even shares some of their families comments. I have enjoyed the first (2) videos so many times I was ready for a new version of the same story!!! Its too good not to enjoy and share. Not many bands have such a happy story like these guys.",1409875200,,1540,4.188552188552189

5256798,5,B009410JOI,"This is a very well presented Rock Documentary of the Story & History of the Doobie Brothers from their very beginning, all the way up through around 2012 when the dvd was produced. Their story is told by members and former band members and managers themselves, which makes this Rock/Doc more credible, than if an ""outsider"" had told their story. It covers their many breakups and reunions, personnel changes, and many details that went on in the band throughout their 40 year history.

The main players in the band seem to be Pat Simmons & Tom Johnston. They were there in the very beginning, and they are both still with the band. The band is currently touring, and they fairly recently released a new album entitled ""World Gone Crazy"", which is a very good album. It seems they have gotten better over time, but that's subjective on my part. This band has had it's share of hardships and personnel changes, and all of this is covered in this dvd.

Apparently after the dvd was produced, their long time ""recent"" bassist ""Skylark"" had a stroke, and he is no longer with the band. In the liner notes and at the end of the dvd, they acknowledge tribute to former band members (brothers) who have passed on.

One thing I really liked about this documentary, is that you get Bonus ""Full Performances"". These Bonus Full Performances are full of great ""Vintage"" Doobie Brothers. They start out with very early performances and then progress into fairly recent performances.

Overall, this is a very good, very well presented documentary, of the story & history of the Doobie Brothes, one of the World's most be-loved bands. As a reviewer, I think most Classic Rock &/or Doobie fans would enjoy this dvd. Thanks!!!!",1363046400,,1710,4.747474747474747

And this is coming from an East Indian who grew up in Africa and spent his tennage years in England. That's where I heard the Doobies for the first time. I consider ""Toulouse Street"", ""The Captain and Me"", and ""What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits"" to be 3 of the greatest albums ever released by any American band. Everyone should own them and this DVD as well. It shows them as crafted musicians who can play the socks of any other band on the planet.",1358985600,,571,4.345794392523365

I consider myself fortunate to have been able to catch the Doobie Brothers live in their prime.
Actually I caught them in a transition phrase. One of the founding members, Tom Johnston, was going to have to miss some tour dates suffering from the rigors of the road. Everyone was nervous. It was the end of 1974, and they were one of the hottest bands in the country. Tom had a bleeding ulcer so no one knew how many shows he'd have to miss.
Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter, one of the newest members of the Doobies, had a thought. He called on fellow Steely Dan alum Michael McDonald.
Little did the band know that Michael wouldn't just be the shot in the arm they needed but also a change in direction.
These are just  a couple of the stories you'll hear on The Doobie Brothers - Let the Music Play, a DVD that traces the group's humble beginning in California in 1969, their rise up the charts and how they've stayed a band for over 40 years.
Along the way you'll hear classic Doobie tunes like ""Rainy Day Crossroad Blues,"" ""Without You,"" ""Listen To the Music,"" ""Black Water,"" ""Takin' It To the Streets,"" ""Rockin' Down the Highway,"" ""Long Train Runnin,'"" and ""China Grove.""
They started out with Tom playing chunky rthym, Patrick Simmons doing masterful finger picking, three part harmony and playing for $1 a night and all they could drink.
Of course, the most famous story is here too, when a hanger-on said, ""You guys smoke so much dope you should call yourselves the Doobie Brothers.""",1358899200,2,1545,4.614545454545454
5256809,5,B009410JOI,"A really good retrospective of this should be in the hall of fame band. Excellent footage, could have a little longer but  very complete.

5256810,5,B009410JOI,"Lets face it I'm one of the doobies bigest fans. Have attended two of their recent tour concerts. They are better than ever. I'm a fingerstyle guitarist my self. While I don't play any of Pat's songs. He has been a great influence in what I do. His song ""Never Far From Home"" from their ""World Gone Crazy"" album is a beautiful and touching song that much of the Baby Boomers can certainly relate to. I bought the CD and the LP Record version which has three additional tracks. Yes, my 1970's record player still works. I compaired the quality of the LP to the CD while playing them at the same time. The LP on my Denon had a better low end than the CD. This story of their history is just outstanding. Especially the obveous ""film clip"" of Tommy actually composing and relating to other members of the band of what he wanted ""musically"" as the tune progressed: just ""Priceless"". It's a blue-ray you'll you will want to watch five times just to get all the interesting details not captured in a single viewing. As a matter of fact I think I've talked myself into viewing it again right now!",1357948800,11,1089,4.396039603960396

5256812,5,B009410JOI,"I've been a huge DB fan for 40 years now.  This new film offers some new insights into the history of the band.  I won't say there is a lot of really new information, but some nice perspectives and some great old footage is offered up.  What really makes it, though, are the bonus live tracks, some dating way back.  Watching Tommy working on the origination of ""Rainy Day Crossroad Blues"" was interesting to me as a musician.

I'd say the only thing that left me puzzled was no conversation at all with John Hartman.  Maybe he didn't want to participate, or maybe there's some bad blood, but it would have been good to hear his thoughts and experiences.

This band is certainly underappreciated for what they've accomplished, and especially for all the neat charity stuff they've done over the years with the Stanford Children's Hospital and National Veterans Foundation.  I've seen them personally in action working to raise money for NVF (especially the efforts of the late Keith Knudsen) and these are great guys as well as great musicians.  That they have not been enshrined in the Rock & Roll HOF is a travesty.",1356739200,,1117,4.687179487179487
5256813,5,B009410JOI,"After attending a Doobie Brothers concert with my mom for the first time last year, I was instantly hooked. I listened to all of their albums and read about their history and all of its ups and downs. A band split into two ""eras""? I couldn't believe it - bands today couldn't survive that the way the Doobs did. This disc is a really nice journey through their history with some gems of live performances thrown in. The interviews are funny and honest, and I certainly learned more about the band and grew to appreciate them even more.

Just to comment on other review's sort of downsides... I read one that said this disc was basically a big advertisement for World Gone Crazy: what?! They only discussed that album for about 5 minutes! And to others simply wanting more content, hey, who wouldn't? But at around 1 hour and 40 minutes, it's a pretty great story, and I think it's also tough because the band has lost quite a few of its most well known members whom I'm sure it would have been a joy to hear from.

But all in all I give this disc 5 stars because it's definitely enjoyable for Doobie Brothers fans, new and old. Both my mother and I enjoyed it and I'm glad to add it to my collection.",1356480000,2,1200,4.328888888888889

They have been through so much as a band and persevered where others were not able to. I have to say I love the original lineup and now the present-day touring lineup. They are such a joy to listen to and I have seen them more than 50 times. This documentary really captures what it was like to start as a club band in the San Jose area to their quick rise to super stardom, band changes and so much more. A big thank you to Pat Simmons for finding the videos and other material and having the wherewithal to know what to do with it.
