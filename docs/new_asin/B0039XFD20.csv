4099092,5,B0039XFD20,"I first saw this movie on lifetime, and was so glad to see it finally on dvd.  This is a touching story of a young boy struggling every day with who he is, trying desperately to be accepted. It's also the story of the emotional struggle, and journey of his devoutly religious mother coming to grips with the fact that her son is gay.  She wrestles with her own belief system, her up-bringing, her deep love for her son, and her desire to find peace and understanding with it all.  This is based on a true story, and it will have an impact on you. Very well done!",1294531200,,562,4.185185185185185
4099093,5,B0039XFD20,"I originally read the book that this movie is based on almost ten years ago. It was such an emotional journey, and yet inspiring story that forever touched my soul. Below is the review I wrote almost ten years ago on the book (here on amazon) with some changes based on me viewing the movie and since coming out. I am very thankful for this beautiful book and movie which helped me come to terms with my own sexuality. I hope it inspires, changes and even saves lives like it did mine.

This book PRAYERS FOR BOBBY is about a a young adult named Bobby Griffith who was an all american guy, but who also happened to be gay, and his mother who has to come to terms with the suicide of her gay son. In this book you see how Bobby faced with the pressure of his family and his religion telling him it is wrong to be gay. You will also read many bone chilling excerpts of Bobbys most personal thoughts straight out of his journal, which shows how much Bobby had been going through from the fight with his religious beliefs to selling himself on the streets as a SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE. There seems like no other answer and soon the pressure is to much to take and Bobby decides to take his own life. Bobbys mom Mary Griffith who was fearful of her sons sexuality and who was a churchgoer used to pray her son would be healed from this sickness, but once her son dies she decided to transform her life by being a national crusador for gay and lesbian youth. This book realy touched my heart and soul because when I was 10 I lost my uncle who was 20 to suicide. We were very close my uncle was not gay as far as we knew, but suicide became something I had no choice but to learn at an early age. This book was a life changing book for me as it made me confront many of my own issues I had to face growing up as a teen. I always knew I was different and this book along with Madonna gave me the courage to finally come out in my mid twenties. PRAYERS FOR BOBBY is one of those books that inspire you to be better and to not judge others by there sexual preferences. I say if you have not read this book you really need to. This book is sad, but yet one of the most inspirational true stories I have ever read. This is about real life and real life does not always have the storybook happy ending, but will inspire so many people.

Sigourney Weaver gave an outstanding performance as her portrayal of Mary Griffith, and Ryan Kelley also gave an amazing performance as Bobby. The movie is very emotional and hard to hold back the tears, but by the end of the movie you see how inspiring and life changing Bobbies death had on his mother. I highly recommend this beautiful movie to anyone who is struggling to understand or coming to terms with being gay.",1294185600,34,2741,4.1893939393939394
4099094,5,B0039XFD20,"This movie is a tragic story of a young gay man's suicide.  Thank God the story doesn't end there!  Mary Griffith is my hero!  Like so many people in this country, she believed everything told to her from the Christian church, including shame, guilt, judgment, condemnation, etc.  The tradegy opened her eyes and she began to think for herself. She took what she learned and is trying to make the world a better place.

The movie is extremely well done, and exceptionally moving.  You won't be able to hold back the tears, but you'll be so uplifted by the end of the movie.  Please watch this movie, it will change your life!",1293753600,2,625,4.526785714285714
4099095,5,B0039XFD20,"This movie based on a true story is a must see for all Americans at this time of debate and uncertainty regarding gay/lesbian rights. It is extremely relevant, especially in light of the recent gay teen suicides. Finally our country is learning that only acceptance will bring peace and happiness. Please also read the book this movie is based on. If you are struggling with coming out to your family, buy them the book and this DVD. It gets better!",1292889600,3,449,4.625
4099096,5,B0039XFD20,"Movies that are created to bring to light issues experienced all around the world are not always the best--mainly because only one side of the issue is presented by the movie in most cases. ""Prayers for Bobby"" is a remarkable film that shows both sides of the story. I first saw this movie on the Lifetime channel and was thrilled when it was announced it would be released to DVD.

This film touches on both sides of the story of a confused teenage boy Bobby Griffith (Ryan Kelley) who has come to terms with his homosexuality, and his mother Mary Griffith (Sigourney Weaver) denial that she could have a gay son. The film shows all of the standard arguments of the religious communities quoting scriptures of how homosexuality is a ""sin"". As well as the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) stance that when those scriptures were written the word abomination was interpreted as different not the ugly convoluted interpretation of today.

""Prayers for Bobby"" tells the story of Mary Griffith (Weaver), who late in life becomes one of the most influential gay rights activists. The path she had to travel to get to that point was an unfortunate one. Mary was devoutly religious and was confronted with a question of faith when her beloved son Bobby (Kelley) admitted to her that he was gay. This was in the early Eighties, and the religious education Mary had received had her convinced that the church could cure her son. Bobby, feeling guilt and remorse for causing his mother pain and having to deal with his homosexuality as if it were a sin. Bobby endured both self loathing and depression, as well as moving to another state to start a new life but was unable to escape his ""inner demons."" When presented with tragedy, Mary had to reevaluate everything she had been taught to believe.

While this film takes place 30 years ago, the points visited in the film bear a remarkable resemblance of events that are taking place today with the instances of bullying and teen suicide which have been highly publicized in the media over the past few months quite possibly society hasn't evolved as much as we think. Intolerance is the major hot button issue. Intolerance is an ugly animal certain religions have failed to combat with some even promoting intolerance. Griffith handled the religious fervor well and is saddened as well as frustrated on many accounts. Weaver portrays Griffith marvelously in this film.

With Griffith's change of heart and belief coming to late for her, she moves forward to fight for the rights and equalities of others to ensure that others do not have to endure what she has. Her final speech in the film is extremely moving and will definitely touch everyone. Keep a watch out for a truly touching scene in the final minutes of the video.

4099097,5,B0039XFD20,"Whiteout is a disorienting weather condition of great danger to pilots because their eyes become useless -- they are ""flying blind.""  They have to fly trusting the readings of their flight instruments.  If the instruments give false readings, the pilot and plane are doomed.

This film is about a mother cast into the disorienting personal situation of finding out her son is gay.  The only instruments she has are her religious faith and the bible -- otherwise she is ""flying blind.""  Segourney Weaver plays the mother with great power and range.  In every confrontation with her son, her eyes are hard and unseeing.  The son is played by Ryan Kelley and in those same confrontations his eyes show a yearning and despair.  He is also a superb actor.  What you are seeing is a mother's love expressed blindly.  She does not realize her ""flight instruments"" are giving false readings due to anti-gay bigotry.

In the end, the son loses everything.  When that happens, this mother's love will not give up.  The same hard determination softens her attitudes.  It is fascinating to watch Segourney Weaver transform her face and her eyes as her character becomes less blind.

This is a powerful film with some great acting.  Strongly recommended.",1292544000,,1241,4.9227053140096615

Some the supporting acting is amateurish and perfunctory. This LIFETIME channel belongs to Sigourney Weaver. She dominates every scene she is in. She is a wonder at conveying emotions just through her facial expressions. If she is perfection before The Tragedy, she is eloquetion in the art, afterwards. She rakes the heart over hot coals as she finally realizes her misconception about her son and his lifestyle. The scene in the church, in the middle of a rainy night, is wrenching!!!

4099212,5,B0039XFD20,"I loved it, but I found some parts very hard to sit through. Sigourney Weaver does an amazing job in the lead but I just found myself grimacing at most of Mary's lines. Ryan Kelley gives a stand-out performance as Bobby; I could feel every emotion that came out of him.  I know how hard it is for guys his age. I didn't go through the same things exactly but it was just as bad. The supporting cast are also excellent, although I'm lukewarm about the guys who played the father and older brother. I bought the DVD about a year before actually watching it. I avoided it because after watching ""The Matthew Shepard Story"", which really tear-jerked me, I didn't want to go through it again. I doubt I would have bought it if Sigourney Weaver wasn't playing the lead in a film like this. I'm not a big fan of Lifetime specials either but I knew I had to watch this one. Anyhow, nevermind my reactions. To any parents of a suspected gay child, you need to see this film. Put your own feelings and any selfishness aside and just accept your child in the way that Mary Griffith was unable to during her son Bobby's lifetime. And if you are a young gay guy who is afraid to come out, this film may help you if you are ready to tell your family. This film is one of the few that have true healing power and really, everyone should see it. As I say, some parts are hard to sit through. Make yourself do it.",1419897600,5,1396,4.208955223880597

4099216,5,B0039XFD20,"This is based on a true story and is a very hard-hitting depiction of the harm that self-righteous Christianity can do to homosexuals. It shows the intolerance towards homosexuality that the self-righteous justify by quoting the Bible. Bobby is gay and finally comes out to his family and, although his siblings and father refuse to accept it they are more placid about it. But his mother is convinced that he will go to Hell for all eternity if he doesn't change. He wants more than anything to have his mother love him and accept him, but she has made him ashamed of who he is so he does what she asks - goes to conversion groups, sees psychiatrists who tell him he can change, and he and his mother pray for his salvation, pray for his conversion. And he becomes more and more miserable, more and more confused, finding himself unable to please his mother no matter what he does while at the same time knowing that denying his homosexuality has led to self-loathing. It's a story that does not end well for Bobby himself, but his mother finally learns the truth, that praying to G-d to fix Bobby didn't work because there was nothing wrong with him that needed to be fixed.",1418256000,2,1176,4.525821596244131

I never cared whether my parents approved of my being gay, and, frankly, I can't imagine why anybody would - certainly not to the bizarre extent of committing suicide over it. I just don't get it.

I'm also sick to death of gay tragedies. For every one who commits suicide, a hundred thousand or more don't; they get through the opposition and disappointments and become functioning adults.

Bobby's homosexuality was incidental to his death. He died because his mother had defined his life for him and he was incapable of living apart from her, so he killed himself. That's the tragedy.

The only difference his being gay made is that it caused her to throw him out of the nest after 18 years of doing everything in her power to keep him dependent on her. If he'd been straight, she would NEVER have let him go, and his life would have been a nightmare: longer, but worse.

At least he had a few months of trying to fly on wings that were too weak to support him, but it was better than seventy years under her in the nest.",1382659200,,1138,4.37914691943128

I had to watch this movie in the living room where everyone walked through and I would turn the channel every single time someone would come through hoping they would see I was watching this movie in fear they might think I was gay. Watching this movie changed my life as a gay male. I am now 19 years old and still watch this movie very often. After coming out I made both my parens watch this and I believe that every parent of straight or gay children should sit down and watch this. This movie is not just about a gay teen who commits suicide.

  This movie starts with a mom who is extremely religious and swears by the bible and when she finds out that her son is gay all she can do is try to fix him. Once he dies she finds out she was much more than wrong. This movie will teach anyone who is willing that being gay is NOT and option for anyone and that criticizing them and telling them it is ""wrong"" is going to do nothing but push them into a darkness that overtakes them. I personally can testify that this movie is a big part of me coming out and it has helped with me being more accepting of who I am as a gay male and I am so thankful that Bobby's story was told.

  I beg anyone to watch this movie whether they think being gay is wrong or if you accept it, it is a story that needs to be heard by everyone. It will shed light on the topic of gay suicide and will greatly help decrease the rate of gay suicide due to people knowing how to treat someone who is coming out of the closet or is already out. Please take the time out of your day to watch this movie or even read the book. I can promise you that it is completely worth it and you will not regret it.",1381536000,5,1728,3.9511494252873565

When he came out, everyone tried to ""fix"" him and it drove him to see himself as a bad person. This movie had some amazing performances in it, so much so that it was hard to watch. It's not just a true story, but it's also performed in such a raw fashion, that it feels like you're standing in the Griffith living room watching it all unfold. A lot of similar movies about tragic stories have been made, but none of them share the raw emotion that this movie has. Sigourney Weaver is at the top of her game and it brings out the best in everyone, especially Ryan Kelley who gives the best performance of his career as Bobby. This is as real as it gets and you will need a box of tissues, but if this is a topic that effects you or someone you know, than I highly recommend taking the time to see this film.",1361664000,,934,4.109289617486339

This movie shows you what can happen if you don't love and support your children for who they are. Remember being gay does not change who that person is, it is another wonderful part of them, but you should never just concentrate on the fact that the child is Gay, Lesbian, Bi-Sexual, or Transgender. Love is love, and this movie is based on a true story, so its not just a manufactured Hollywood campaign to end the countrys undefined definition of marriage as many radically conservative people say it is.

God welcomes all but ridged interpretation often places its own conditions on acceptability and Bobbie through his own actions paid the price  of societies shunning of gays.

Anyone who's different in any way knows that. Prayers for Bobby opens up all these doors and asks many questions: about faith, God, homosexuality, the family unit. I wish everyone could get along so tragedies like what happened to Bobby never happen to anybody ever again.

Many of my favorite films are coming-of-age dramas. Stand by Me, Mask, Phenomenon, etc. Prayers for Bobby is also a coming-of age drama that will break your heart and then heal it at the end. Brilliant work and one of my new favs. :)

4099324,5,B0039XFD20,"One essential true story of the last twenty-five years, this one concerning gays and lesbians in our society that rejects them in the name of all kinds of ""abominations"". Bobby Griffiths, rejected and forced to leave his own community and family, first of all his mother, left and tried to live his life as a gay person who can love more than he has been hated and rejected. But that's hard. Hate is a poison and the antidote has not been discovered yet, at least not for quite many people yet who seem to be allergic to any cure. That's hard indeed.

That's hard when your own parents had not felt the difference in you and had not encouraged you to be yourself because they want you to be them, like them at least. Parents can be so umbilical and self-centered at times.

That's hard because at school and in all events where young people and teenagers meet to have fun, receive an education or practice a sport of any type, there will always be a few bullies who will bash you because deep in their heart they are so afraid of not being normal that they have to bash those they feel are different, and the vast majority around these few, including the police too often, do not say anything, do not move one single little finger, you know the pinky, and we have two, to defend the bullied one, to stop the bully, to prevent that kind of violence, oral, verbal or physical violence.

That's hard when the organizations and the ideologies, the religions and the philosophies you try to believe in reject you without any appeal, without any second thought, without any pity, compassion, empathy. True we do not need pity, but that's the minimum these pitiless people should get to not to become pitiful and pathetic. Compassion is already better and yet there is some kind of a consideration that your lot is a suffering of some kind, something that makes you suffer and we just want to share that suffering. That is better than nothing but not enough. You have to get to and give empathy to gays and lesbians just as much as to anyone on earth. Empathy is sharing your mental experience with others and sharing others' mental experiences deep down into your own mind and heart.

And that's the road Mary Griffiths, the mother who was only able to quote the wrong verses of the Bible and to interpret them in the wrong way inherited from some old times, when homosexuals where fried on a grill or deep fried in oil on the public place in some kind of festive event, and to finally declare ""I will not have a gay son!"" and when Bobby said "" You must have me the way I am or not at all."" She answered ""Then I don't have a son."" How frighteningly horrible for a mother supported, encouraged, manipulated by her society, her church, the media, her political parties, her whatever organizations you may think of, to say to her own son, her own blood and flesh.

The shock of the loss of her son in such a frightening way, run over by an eight-wheeler, with maybe even more than eight wheels, in order not to survive the instant when his suffering brought by the denunciation by his own family, the rejection by his own mother came back to the surface in a strange city, in the dark night, away from home, family and childhood friends, brothers and sisters, with no one to share this fright with.

The film is extremely well done and effective because we see the dramatic and even tragic lot of the young man, of Bobby, and at the same time the slow conversion of the mother as a defender of the rights that had been negated by society, and by herself, to her own son. To cure bigotry is a lot more difficult and hard than to cure or simply survive through cancer, AIDS, or a heart attack. It takes time, patience and conviction in the mind of those who are infected by that mental disease. But there is no other way to do it.

Let's all of us bless the child, all children, with pure empathy and understanding, support and pride, gay pride maybe but self-pride anyway.

The conflicts are handled well, especially Weaver's internal conflict as she goes about trying to ""cure"" her son.  Most importantly to me, though, is the fact that her own conversion is believable, not at all contrived.  Very good performances, excellent script that backs away neither from religion nor from homosexuality as a life style/way of being, and a wonderful message about tolerance and compassion and love, and you have an excellent movie.  The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is the way that it violates the fourth wall at the end of the film, when Weaver's character so very obviously is talking to us as viewers.  It's over the top and very distracting, and while it may be effective in a lot of ways, it's more about pushing an agenda than about good movie making.",1330214400,,1093,4.844086021505376

4099333,5,B0039XFD20,I watched this film after reading a good review in the San Francisco Chronicle.  I'm glad I did.  It is a wonderful (and heartbreaking) story more about the mother in the film than her gay son. Being a gay man born in the '60's I've known a lot of people who want to shove scriptures down your throat as way of fulfilling their own mission to please God. This is what the movie really addresses.  The story is heartbreaking when the mother in the movie realizes she may have been the very cause of her son's suicide.  What is inspiring is how she lives her life after the fact and comes to terms with her own weakness' and failings... that ALL people are struggling. It's also inspirational to watch her struggle and overcome her own prejuduges only to become stronger and more sensitive to the world around her. (Many people stunt their own spiritual growth by refusing to question their  beliefs.) Ms. Weaver does an excellent job of portraying the many dimensions her character requires. The extras on the dvd are as interesting to watch as the movie itself.  All churches should have a copy of this film in their library.,1328054400,,1125,4.5721393034825875

Unless you are walking in someone else's shoes we all need to be more tolerant of what we all go through each and every day.

The acting in this movie is incredible.  The story is such an important one.  I just feel it should be shown at all high schools, but I am realistic and know the fuss that would cause.  But I just admire the journey Bobby's mom took.  This movie deals with the issues that keep people wrongly judging homosexuals.  I like the religious aspect of it and how that was handled.

The message in this movie is one of love and acceptance.  It also shows that parents need to listen and be accepting because otherwise they might have to live with guilt that nobody should have to feel.

I honestly feel Bobby would be incredibly proud of his mother, and I feel we all need to learn from her journey.

So sad that in real life this mom had to loose her son before she realized he was just who God made him as we all are. He didn't have a choice in who he was no more then we had a choice in the color of our skin, the color of our eye's or being born with a silver spoon in our mouth.

When I first saw it, I found she'd been right in suggesting it, as it truly turned out being one of my more favorite ones to view time and again here too.  Having studied my own self at seminary and my having thereby a background adequate to evaluate such types of films that display or provoke certain types of films as this turned out to be for me when I saw it, it actually is quite the provocative film that gives the kind of a respect to gay folk that we who are deserve to receive publically, but mostly, it has a perspective on the whole ""coming out process"" that is as most who've been there, all equally are more than aware just how totally unique it is for those of us to have to endure the process of our own ""coming out by going through it all"" is somehow something that cannot be avoided either to be ever so more than certainly so sure of here too.  In any event, trust me when I share with you how thoroughly vigorously supportive of gay rights that this film is for a meaningful way of displaying publically just how completely inappropriate is that which negates gay rights in our world, just as equally it is much the same thing that apparently the mother in the movie did upon learning of her son's dilemma of confronting that horrible inner conflict which those of us who find it necessary to come out of our little closets find ourselves in, and since this tragic ending of this particular film shows us in a far more actually marvelous way just how thoroughly appropriate our coming out process actually is for us to go through on our way to our individual freedoms to become appropriately so enjoyed by us all, I wish to very surely recommend this movie, as it truly is ""one of those"" movies that helps to shape the future dreams we have made and helps bring them into the reality they equally rightly and as very richly deserve throughout the age just as so many others like Inherit the Wind, 12 Angry Men, and such films like that always have done too!",1312502400,,2221,4.334134615384615

This award winning film made in 2009 depicting the 1970s tells the very sad story  of a mother's intolerance and rejection of her gay-son (who is very in need of his family's acceptance and love) causes  him  to commit  suicide which, of course, shatters the mother's  world as well as shattering the lives of the rest of her family.

Sigourney Weaver as the (in the beginning) very ""stiff-lipped"" very religious mom that will not tolerate or love any gay person becomes, after her son's suicide, more enlightened and a pro-gay activist, is very good in this film delivering a very good performance.  In fact, all roles are done very well in this film including the very ""testy"" grandmother.

His family isn't accepting of his ""sin,"" and it shows how much it affected the character based on a real-life story. Although in some ways the ending isn't your typical happy one, it is indeed happy in other ways. Bobby's mother questions her faith and becomes a leader for youth GLBT rights after the tragic suicide of her son. The film really hit it home with me because I could see myself in Bobby's shoes. My parents are religious, as am I, and I am struggling to maintain a proper balance of both my religion and sexuality. This movie gives me hope that one day perhaps, my parents will accept me for who I am, rather than assuming it's a sin. I hope to muster up the courage to ask them to watch this film with me.

""Prayers for Bobby"" is a powerful true story about a teenage boy named Bobby Griffith (played by a superb Ryan Kelley) in the late 70s who comes out to his devout Christian mother, Mary (Sigourney Weaver in an Emmy and Golden Globe nominated performance), who subsequently tries to ""cure"" her son through prayer and conversion therapy.  When these efforts fail and Bobby tells her she needs to accept him or risk losing him as a son, she turns her back on him.  He ends up committing suicide, unable to deal with her rejection of him.  This leads Mary on a path of self-discovery as she tries to understand what happened to her son and sees how her intolerance brought him to this end.  ""Prayers for Bobby"" laid in development limbo for some time, possibly to be a made as a major studio film, but the content made it a bit off-putting for some, but Lifetime stepped up to the plate.  Lifetime is hardly known for the highest quality TV movies, but with a first-rate script and scoring Sigourney Weaver in the lead elevates this production to a prestige project.  The story is beautifully told, although it feels a bit rushed in places, which also short-changes some of the supporting players such as Susan Ruttan, who plays a friend of mary's whose son also is gay and serves as a touchstone for her.  This relationship isn't fully developed in the constraints of a 90 min film.  Dan Butler is superb as a gay reverend who runs a church which accepts all.  The film is painful, moving, and ultimately hopeful.  Weaver is a tour-de-force reminding us why she is one of the finest actresses of our time.  She makes a potentially revolting character sympathetic and very human.  Ryan Kelley was shamefully overlooked at award season, as he makes Bobby so likable and heartbreaking that we miss him right along with his family.  This is the kind of film which should be shown in schools and parents groups as to the dangers of intolerance.  Very well done and very much worth owning.  The movie, despite its grim subject matter, is quite entertaining...it really isn't as depressing as it sounds and its message is a worthy one.

4099362,5,B0039XFD20,"A Great movie about a true and sad story, but one filled with realization and redemption. Sigourney Weaver (already one of my favorite actors), gives a Bravura performance as Bobby's mother; after seeing the movie, it is actually difficult to imagine anyone else in this role. Ryan Kelly is outstanding also as the tormented and doomed Bobby. But more than just a great and heartfelt performance, the viewer can readily imagine that she and the other members of the cast know that they are likely contributing to a work of film art that will inevitably save young lives. How many young people will see this film, read the book of the same name, and have their lives changed or even saved, is unknowable, but that very many will is beyond dispute. Even though the events depicted in this film took place in the 1980's, it is still (sadly) 100% relevant and timely today. One can only hope that in another few years ahead, this story and movie will become but an historical footnote and a window to an age of ignorance and bigotry that will be fading into our past, much as the worst of the racial discrimination of the twentieth century is now doing.

Certainly, ""Prayers for Bobby"" will have had a significant role in changing hearts and opening minds against the destructive power of misguided religious fervor and certitude. Every young person of high school and college age, regardless of sexual orientation, should see this film and take its message to heart. It is far more than just a great film. It is a story that must be told, and it can and will prevent the kind of tragedy that is unfortunately all too common and still unfolding all around us.",1297555200,2,1655,4.648464163822526

4099364,5,B0039XFD20,"I just finished reading the book this TV-movie was based on, and in a
way it's a pity that they couldn't get it made as a full-length feature
film, for the Griffith family's story is more complex and interesting
than the cinematic fast-food that we are left with once you make room
for the commercials.

That being said, I still give this remarkable film a 10 because, even
within the constraints of the TV-movie format, this is an involving,
compelling, and deeply touching story about a mother's failure to
understand, its consequences for her son, her family, and mostly for
herself.

The rather complex book has been pared down to the central conflict:
Bobby's homosexuality and his mother's religious fanaticism. To her
credit, Mary Griffith does not throw her son out into the streets when
she learns he's gay, as so often happens. But what she does is in some
ways worse: determined to *fix* him through a religious campaign, she
prays, she constantly points out his *feminine* mannerisms, and perhaps
worst of all, she puts sticky notes with Bible verses all over the
house where the poor kid cannot fail to see them.

Bobby makes an abortive attempt to flee the constraints of his mother's
domain by taking his own apartment in Portland, OR. But tragically, his
self-loathing has already been too deeply ingrained, and one night, he
throws himself off an underpass into the path of a semi.

What sets this film apart is that this is not the story of a kid who
wasn't loved. Bobby's suicide makes his family literally implode with
grief and anguish, and sends his mother on a quest for some kind of
redemption. Drowning in guilt, she seeks out the advice of the pastor
of the local Metropolitan Community Church, but at first she has a hard
time bringing herself to accept his comforting views on Scripture.

Sigourney Weaver is amazing here. In the beginning of the movie, her
religion makes her rigid, controlling, and unable to hear the cry of
anguish coming from her son. His death shatters her so completely that
the Mary Griffith we see after the funeral is a completely different
woman: walking bent over, she seems to be about to be crushed under the
load of grief and guilt she carries. and if you do not shed tears when
she breaks down and says that the reason God did not fix Bobby was
because there was nothing wrong with him, better check your pulse.

The rest of the cast is equally good, particularly Ryan Kelley as
Bobby. We feel every bit of the pain this young man experienced. When
he finally gives in to his agony and commits suicide, we are horrified,
but not exactly surprised.

Should be required viewing for everyone who thinks that Gay people are
somehow less worthy.",1297036800,4,2700,4.6835443037974684
4099365,5,B0039XFD20,"When Lifetime aired this movie 2 years ago, I was awestruck at how narrow-minded and right wing religious the character portrayed by Ms. Weaver was during the first half. Only after losing her son did she realize it was not HIM that was errant, but HER! Mr. Czerny did not play Mr. Griffith, Bobby-the title character's father-as an emotional man, nor did he seem the dominant of the 2 parents. This was somehow unsettling to me, but alas, perhaps this was how the real-life Mr. Griffith was. The characters in the immediate Griffith family did very well in their respective roles,and Dan Butler whom I am a fan of since ""Frazier"" days was a casting coup. However it was Ms. Weaver who portrayed Mrs. Griffith so humanly that still effects me to this day. It took me 2 years to muster up enough emotional strength to watch it again on LMN(Lifetime Movie Network).This teleplay deserves a look-see from anyone who has had a struggle to be who they are, also the parents who claim ""God will redeem you"" to their children who are not conforming to their (parents) idea of who they should be. It's an education for anyone who is stubborn in realizing that their version of ""normal"" doesn't always pan out that way for their son, daughter, neice, nephew, grandchild,room-mate etc. Buy this movie or catch it ( and record it) next time it airs, oh, and have a box of kleenex handy...EXCELLENT!",1295827200,3,1387,4.66530612244898
