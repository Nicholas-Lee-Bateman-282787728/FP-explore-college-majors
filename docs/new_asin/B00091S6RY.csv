2260069,4,B00091S6RY,"I thought the movie was pretty good considering the corn and cheese in it.  I thought the whole idea of the movie wasn't to dwell on the religion too much and what each believes, but to highlight that all religions/people need to act more Christ-like to each other.  I thought it was pretty clear that both sides felt the same about each other...""We're right, you're wrong and crazy and we don't like you."" And I felt that the Mormons were equally as hesitant and unhappy to mix as the Baptists were.  They weren't exactly happy to invite the Baptists to the party.  If it had been titled Mormons at our Barbecue, I don't think it would have mattered because that wasn't the point.  If you are looking for a movie that is entertaining, clean, and touches on being kind to one another regardless of religion, this is a great little movie.  If you are looking for a movie that is close to 100% realistic, you'll have to look elsewhere.  That isn't the point of the movie, either.",1147219200,3,977,4.4858757062146895
2260070,4,B00091S6RY,"This is a really well done movie, lush visuals, a variety of interesting and eccentric characters, and good comedic dialog and pace. Everybody knows a sister Wingate with her ""I'm better than anyone else and let me tell you about it"" attitude.

The story's female lead sticks out from this eccentric and well portrayed crowd as a single dimensional character, her love life. She broke up with Howard and ends up in the small town to recover. Inevitably she succumbs to the romancing of main character Tartan. But her acting is a flat and lifeless as a placid lake, there is no life there, no spirit, and she is not so good looking that she can overcome these flaws. The non-speaking character played by Diane Rane, the imported branch president's wife, shows more character in her less-than-a-minute on the screen than Beers does in the whole show.

See the movie, it is a great example of LDS film and should be considered outside that genre as well.",1145232000,4,951,4.688622754491018
2260071,4,B00091S6RY,"Baptists at Our Barbeque is a movie apparently produced primarily for a Mormon audience.  By way of example, there are any number of inside jokes and references that Gentiles will probably miss entirely, a stark contrast to Garrison Keillor's Lake Woebegon where even outsiders get the jokes.  But much like Lake Woebegon, the essential plot and almost comic innocence of the characters who populate this movie make it broadly appealing.

The story is simple enough: an unmarried, 29 year-old Mormon forest ranger decides to accept a transfer to the oddball town of Longfellow to escape the efforts of his mother (and the efforts of the mothers of every unmarried girl in Provo) to get him hitched.  But Longfellow is no ordinary town.  Tucked away somewhere in the beautiful Rockies, it is a community precisely divided between Baptists and Mormons.  This balance, and the competition is engenders, essentially fuels the movie.  Yes, there are the colorful and eccentric characters we have come to expect from small town settings ever since Andy Griffith introduced us to Barney, Floyd and the rest of the off-kilter residents of Mayberry; and there is the central love story between ""Tartan,"" the main character, and the incredibly beautiful ""Charity,"" played by Heather Beers. There is even an antagonist, the pathetic ""Rich"" who provides the movie's small amount of tension and danger.

What unfolds is general silliness wrapped around a deeper story of the Baptist and Mormon communities coming together.  Recalling the original Star Trek episode, ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,"" starring Frank Gorshin, the essential point of this movie is that while the Mormons and Baptists of Longfellow may see each other as starkly ""different,"" to the eyes of outsiders they are in fact all but identical.  Where skin-deep differences in ""Let That Be...."" led to tragedy, however, the characters in Barbeque eventually come to see that the differences are unimportant.

Neither the script nor the essential story call for great acting, and the cast does a more than decent job engaging us in the respective quirks of their characters.  If there are faults to be found in this movie a central one is that in an effort to depict the characters as completely wholesome, even essential human emotions are bleached out of existence.  While the addition of graphic sex would NOT have improved the story one iota, the main character's lack of response when his house is torched by the local miscreant strikes a dissonant chord and somehow loses him the sympathy the audience has built for him.  A second point is that the movie is essentially told entirely from the Mormon's perspective.  While the script certainly is not heavy on theology, the lack of Baptist perspective leaves that group looking simply like bigots.  Finally, one wonders what the story would have been like if it had featured Catholics and Lutherans.  But that particular minefield has long been staked out by Keillor and these are small quibbles.  Maybe there really are towns like this somewhere where people just naturally and repeatedly turn the other cheek  Would that it were so...we could all learn a lesson from such tolerance.",1126656000,4,3198,5.080305927342256
2260072,5,B00091S6RY,"While marketed and generally reviewed as a Mormon movie, or at best a Christian film, ""Baptists at Our Barbecue"" can stand on its own as a well-told tale of small-town life. In the same vein as ""Northern Exposure"" (including a great, eclectic soundtrack, btw) or Tom Bodett's tales, ""Baptists"" does revolve around religion - but in the same way ""Northern Exposure"" revolved around Joel Fleishman being a New Yorker stuck in Alaska. One need not be Mormon nor Baptist (lapsed Catholic here) to enjoy this film's excellent character development, large cast of lovable eccentrics, or strong story telling.",1119052800,19,602,5.153061224489796
2260073,4,B00091S6RY,"I found quite a few funny moments in this film, however it was becase I had served a mission and been in branches that were as remote as the one in this story. It made me uncomfortable on the same level for the same reasons. Seeing how traditions of isolated groups can diverge from the norm of the Church can be humorous in context, but does not give a favorable or accurate view of the Church or the Gospel. Also the rivalry of the town has to be seen in the context of how Mormons used to be treated by and large not the general relationship of religious communities today, hate mongoring of certain ""Christian"" radio and TV ministries aside.
On a positive note... this film shows a great lesson that the Church has learned through the years is that there is more to be gained by finding what we have in common rather than the differences.",1118448000,4,842,4.369426751592357
2260074,5,B00091S6RY,"Okay, it's probably not something you would take your family of 4 (7 if you're Mormon) to the theater and pay $8 each to see.

But it's much better than ""Home Teachers,"" and infinitely better than ""Singles Ward.""

I'd probably rank it slightly ahead of Best 2 Years, but this is entirely a Romance/Comedy.

I don't think you have to be Mormon to like this movie.

There are no A- or B-list actors in it, but the writing and directing is good, better than most previous Mormon movies.

As to another reviewer's implication that this movie makes Baptists out to be ""the bad guys"", just know that the Mormons in the movie get lampooned as much as anyone else.  I'm sure there are just as many uptight LDS who cringed at the negative Mormon stereotypes in the movie, as Baptists who cringed at the Baptist stereotypes.

But just like in the movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", there are stereotypes in all religions and cultures.  Part of everyone getting along is laughing at ourselves.

It's just a movie.  And a funny one, to boot.",1117929600,22,1028,4.538043478260869
2260075,1,B00091S6RY,"It is obviously a movie made just for Mormons as they would be the only ones to understand all the inside jokes.  Mormons would find this movie hilarious.  Obviously, a few Christians found it funny too since ""Standing Together Ministries"" endorsed it.  I don't quite understand that.

Being one who has been bought by the precious blood of Jesus Christ, holiness is a serious issue for me.  Not to gain salvation or any merit with God, but to show my gratitude for what He has done for me.  So it greatly disturbed me to see how the producers of this film characterized Christians (Baptists in particular) as low down dirty, fighters, brawlers, willing to do anything to hurt or cause trouble for Mormons.  They even made one woman that I remember to dress like a prostitute and basically act like one too.  This was insulting to me.

It greatly disturbed me too, that Mormons would characterize Christians in this way because if this is the way Mormons see Christians, then something is greatly amiss with those Christians they are looking at.  Are they Christians at all?

It was set up to make Christians appear quite a few notches lower on the totem pole than Mormons.  If it was made with the intent of bringing Mormons and Christians  together and foster good relations, then they failed.

I wasn't sure what the point of the movie was.  It was just plain weird.  At the end the Baptists and the Mormons were all up on the hill acting like a bunch of fools listening to a hum and acting like it was sign from God that they should all be huggy and lovey-dovey.  Of course I know it was supposed to be ridiculous, but is the message here that we should all just throw our doctrine out the window and compromise for the sake of warm fuzzies all over?  Mormons and Christians can be friendly and decent to one another and should be, but not at the expense of doctrinal compromise.",1116633600,5,1883,4.520710059171598
2260076,4,B00091S6RY,"BAPTISTS AT OUR BARBECUE is an amusing film with many qualities that make it enjoyable. It tells the story of a young man named Tartan who moves from Utah to a small town called Longfellow, nicknamed Longwinded to escape the pressure from his mother to get married. In his new community he discovers that all of the townspeople are either Mormon or Baptist and the two religious groups despise one another. The town is filled with eccentrics and Tartan has to learn to navigate his way. He and a young woman named Charity and the Mormon elder realize that the feud between the two groups is ridiculous and they devise a plan to have an ""All Faiths Barbeque"" to bring the two together. The plan works. Tartan and Charity fall in love, and the movie has a predictable ending.

It would be easy to take a cynical approach and pan the film, but as I watched it, I found myself laughing and found much of it silly, but funny. Remember silly but funny works. The HERBY THE LOVEBUG series, WHAT'S UP DOC, and IT'S A MAD MAD WORLD were all blockbusters. While the film is Mormon based, any religious groups could be substituted for Mormon or Baptist which gives ita  universal quality. Then as I thought about it, I realized that the film had strengths many films that poke fun at religious situations lack. The film pokes fun at the people's idiosyncrasies but never makes fun of faith so it does not offend. The people are flawed, but their flaws make them human, not hypocrites. Perhaps the reason it is so enjoyable is that we see ourselves and others we know in this film.",1114128000,34,1569,4.52112676056338
2260077,3,B00091S6RY,"Okay, I admit, I'm a fan of ""Mormon cinema""...even though they tend to be on the ""cheesy side"" of wholesome (would you like some velveeta with your milk and honey?). From this film's trailer that I saw on other Halestorm dvds, I expected a funnier film that goes to the heart of religious dialogue and tolerance. Oh, and I expected it to be funny too. Disappointing in both elements, though I did have a couple chuckles.

First, what I like about it were the lead characters, especially Heather Beers as Charity. She was great in her role as a jilted lover who runs off to a small town to get over her abusive fiance. The male lead, who plays Tartan, is equally delightful, as his facial expressions clearly show what he's thinking and how he's feeling. They are two good actors in a film that doesn't rise to their level of talent, and that's a shame. I hope they will find roles in future films, in Saltywood or Hollywood. I also liked the Native American guy, but his role was miniscule. He should have been one of the major characters...he has a cool presence about him and some cool lines.

Now, what I didn't like about the film...This film played up the division between Mormons and Baptists in a small town named ""Longfellow"" (they don't give a state, so it could be anyone that borders Utah, so it's either Idaho, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, or perhaps even eastern Oregon), but we don't really meet any Baptists and see what they think about the Mormons...other than a few eccentric minor characters and the plot about the ugliness of the Mormon chapel. This film obviously skewers towards the Mormons, making them look like the rational, olive branch extending diplomats and the Baptists look like inbred imbeciles with irrational dislikes of the Mormons. That's not how the movie advertised itself! I would have liked to have seen more Baptists characters and normal ones at that, and to hear what they have against the Mormons. The impression I got was that this film wasn't fully developed...and everyone knows what happens when you undercook meat at a barbecue.

There's little preaching and no baptisms in this film, and a somewhat funny incident in the hills as one lapsed Mormon lady hears a voice crying out, which brings the townfolk together, putting aside their differences. It was a nice, touching scene that fell somewhat flat, because the film didn't focus on any Baptists early on. The filmmakers didn't even try on that point, so that's why I was disappointed and only give it three stars. The best Mormon films still remain the three Missionary films (""The Best Two Years"", ""God's Army"", and ""The Other Side of Heaven"").

Ignore any trailer you might have seen.  This film is really about a 29 year old single Mormon male with a mother who's always trying to hook him up with a ""sweet spirited"" Mormon girl so he can be eternally wed. He finds a job in a small town and meets up with a Mormon girl who had run away from her fiance. They flirt and fall in love. Basic romantic comedy material, with little romance or comedy, bogged down by some eccentric characters as they learn to tolerate each other. Its worth seeing, but probably not owning. I'm still hoping Halestorm will produce a more polished script. This film is not it. Maybe ""Suits on the Loose"" will be that film, but that's just hitting theaters in the Intermountain west and won't be on dvd anytime soon.",1112918400,11,3408,4.673333333333333

This film was a disappointment from the first five minutes.  Very slow paced for a comedy, too slow paced for any movie.  The main character doesn't arrive in the religiously divided town for almost 20 minutes into the film and when he does all the characters both Baptist and Mormons are not treated with respect and end up looking like foolish zealots.

The love story is very weak and unrealistic.  The villain is a bumbling foolish redneck stereo type and it even pokes fun at miracles when the most zealous of the mormons hears moaning in the mountains and misinterprets as the hills humming as if God is speaking to her.  When she takes the towns people up to the mountains they hear it and miraculously all the Baptists and Mormons are now getting along and hugging and kissing each other.  But it turns out the humming is the moaning of the villain who feeling bad for what he did went up to the mountains to wallow in self pity but fell down into a cavern and all he could do was moan... very lame!

I would not recommend this film to anyone Baptist or Mormon.  Neither religion was treated with respect and the Baptist did not get nearly enough screen time as the movie was purely from a Mormon point of view.  Very lame.  An indie movie like this should have the ability to make us think to be more progressive.  I thought this film would be a great way for my friends and I to share our differences and laugh over them.

If it was written for a Mormon audience, then it must have been for those who do not understand Church doctrines or do not agree with them.

It almost seems as if an anti-Mormon activist wrote the script because the film makes Church leaders seem like fools, with the Stake President calling a man to be Branch President just because of the size of his house, the General Authorities of the Church sending the branch a cheap manufactured home, which was never set up right, to be used as their chapel, the Branch President being sustained by a High Councilor, etc.  The film even makes fun of receiving inspiration from the Spirit to the point where it implies that all such feelings are from sources other than God.

The film also shows that no one in the town, Mormon or Baptist, will be willing to treat those of other faiths in a Christ-like way until they receive a false sign from God.

The only thing this film has going for it is that there is no offensive violence, sexuality, or profanity.  If you like Mormon Cinema, skip this one completely and try out the vastly better The Work and the Glory movies, The Best Two Years, or Dutcher's God's Army films.",1161734400,6,1387,4.52
2260114,3,B00091S6RY,"I watched this because the box said it was nominated for some awards. BY WHOM??? Ok, there were a few times I laughed, but for the most part, it was so stupid and corny and lacked any professional acting abilities that I had to ask myself, ""Do I really want to sit here any longer?"". But I did, out of curiosity. It was a waste of money and time. Spare yourself the drudgery!

2260115,1,B00091S6RY,"OK, I am not a Mormon. I just picked up this movie from the rental place becase it looked like fun.

Maybe, if you are a Mormon, and this kind of stuff is all you get to see, you will think this movie is worthwhile. However for anyone else this movie is just an insult to your braincells. The acting between the ""scenes"" of porn movies is generally better and even the Olson Twins movies have more story line. Need I say more?

But then, you never know, maybe this thing will turn into a cult movie. Before it gets to that point I would spend my 99 cents for rental on something else..... anything else.",1157328000,3,603,4.189655172413793
2260116,5,B00091S6RY,"Like a healthy, wonderful meal with no after-taste. This is the sort of film you can almost live in - at our house, everyone in our older family wanted to see it again (and again). The production values are not amazing - this is no David Lean masterpiece, But the ambling story, the screenplay, the direction, the casting -- they all just click. While this is technically a Mormon film, as a non-denominational Christian who hangs out with Baptists a lot, I can't believe you'll find it in anyway offensive or agenda-oriented. It's just a fun story about learning to appreciate everyday people - about respecting, valuing and even enjoying those whose culture on the surface seems too flawed or too ordinary or too simple to merit your time.",1153353600,4,741,4.751937984496124
2260117,4,B00091S6RY,"I bought this DVD on a whim at Hollywood Video and it was just a lot of fun to watch.

Yes, it's clearly a low-budget little movie but I very much liked the actors and thought the did a great job. It's a quirky movie with odd characters, most of whom are over-the-top, so don't expect subtlety. Other reviewers have criticized Heather Beers' performance as flat in the co-starring role. Maybe a little, but she is beautiful and pleasant and I'll be looking for her other movies, though I don't think there are many.

As for insider Mormon jokes, I felt like I got most if not all of the humor and I am not LDS. And I did find the movie to be funny in a gentle way. I don't know that I laughed out loud but it was enjoyable and, again, quirky without being strange or stupid. I like off-beat movies and I found this one to be easier to watch than, say, Big Fish or O Brother, Where Art Thou?

Finally, I really enjoyed the soundtrack. Much of the music just put a smile on my face.",1151107200,7,980,4.147368421052631

Acting was nonexistent (sometimes folks are not well known for a REASON) and story line was laughably predictable (perhaps a good thing because there were no laughs elsewhere).  Pass.
