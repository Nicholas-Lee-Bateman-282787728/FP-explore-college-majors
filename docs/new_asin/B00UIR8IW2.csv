7045452,3,B00UIR8IW2,This seems to be a much different feel than the other seasons. I'm still enjoying it but not as much.,1433462400,2,101,4.1
7045453,5,B00UIR8IW2,"I recently bought the blu-ray version of this product.  I am thoroughly enjoying it.  After seven seasons (based on the DVD releases of the original series), Inuyasha and his friends finally bring an end to their longtime opponent, Naraku.  The 26 episode series nicely wraps up this story that I have followed for years.

The episodes are divided into a four disc (blu-ray) collection.  I found myself really enjoying the series.  I even liked the new voice actors (for the English dub.  The Japanese dub has the complete original cast).  Many fans of the series know that Moneca Stori (Kagome) and David Kaye (Sesshomaru) did not reprise their roles for the new series.  I found myself enjoying Michael Daingerfield, Sesshomaru's new voice actor.  He sounded so similar to David Kaye.  Kira Tozer, Kagome's new voice actress is... serviceable.  She sounds nothing like Moneca Stori, but after a few episodes, I found myself not minding because she was still good.

The special features are kinda sparse: the original Japanese trailers that advertised the series, production art, English credits, and previews for other Viz projects.

The picture and sound on the blu-ray is amazing as well, featuring a 1080p HD 16x9 video display along with DTS-HD audio.

Overall, ""Inuyasha: The Final Act"" is a great show. I recommend it to any Inuyasha fan, especially if you wish to see this feudal fairy tale come to an end.",1433289600,75,1415,4.961702127659574
7045454,5,B00UIR8IW2,Purchased as a gift. Apparently it has been watched 3x all the way through. So I would say she loves it.,1433289600,,104,4.0

7045456,4,B00UIR8IW2,I only wish kagome's voice actress was the same as the other seasons. She just doesn't say Inu-Yasha the same way. :/,1433030400,2,117,4.363636363636363
7045457,5,B00UIR8IW2,"The inuyasha series teaches the value of loyalty, friendship, trust, moral character, faithfulness, teamwork and the things needed to be understood by the target audience it is intended to reach. I'd recommend the series for any teen or preteen because it contains the elements that that group of people would enjoy watching while teaching the viewer the lessons mentioned before. On my list of the top twenty anamies it is number one.",1520899200,,435,5.055555555555555
7045458,5,B00UIR8IW2,Ive always been a huge fan of InuYasha so I was ecstatic to see that they finished the anime. I feel like they could have taken a little more time to wrap up the ending but it was still very good.,1519948800,,196,3.8048780487804876

7045465,5,B00UIR8IW2,"As always this tv series is a wonderful piece of art! It is well written and I cannot find anything to complain about. This last season of inuyasha left me speechless! I was astonished at how it ended. I cried,laughed and cried some more because I knew this was the end of inuyasha for now. The way they have the story of this final season is sure to take you on a emotional roller coaster you will never forget. You get more than what you pay for and I would gladly buy this again. Hopefully they will come out with a continued version of Inuyasha where their children go on a adventure of their own! I will certainly pay to see that.",1515110400,,635,4.213114754098361

7045468,5,B00UIR8IW2,Good ending to inuyasha. Get over shishomaru and his voice. He doesnt sound as badass but I just ignored him most of them time. He is the evil demon I loved back in the day. Get over it,1513123200,,185,3.8947368421052633
7045469,4,B00UIR8IW2,I love Inuyasha sooooo much I watched this growing up and was happy to finally buy all of the seasons but I wish I knew that kagomes voice actor is not her in this season!!! when i heard her voice i was so ticked! I was about to shut the disc off I was so angry not knowing that she was not going to be in this last season! I got used to it when it was about done but it wasn't the same... still loved it though.,1512691200,,412,3.6931818181818183
7045470,5,B00UIR8IW2,"The new voice for Kagome just felt a bit awkward to hear, not that the it isn't good. Adjusted fairly easily.  End felt kinda rushed to me.",1511049600,,139,4.148148148148148

7045479,3,B00UIR8IW2,"I really wanted to watch the end of the show, and the characters are as great as usual. But it's still a little jarring how different the new Kagome voice is. I wished they'd found someone with a more similar voice.",1499817600,,215,4.2682926829268295

Packing was good and nice cover
Unopened and to my likings :)",1494892800,,86,4.117647058823529
7045483,5,B00UIR8IW2,"I was a little skeptical about this series, since it came after the show ended, but I am so glad I got it. It flows seamlessly from the last season, as though the show never ended. All the main voice actors are the same (except Kagome - but the new actor does great and it's not that noticeable a difference). Even most of the secondary characters have the same voice actors. The quality of the animation is the same as in the original show - maybe even a little sharper.
The storylines are good, and very satisfying because there is finally a lot of resolution that never happened in the main series.",1494374400,5,601,4.375
7045484,5,B00UIR8IW2,"I'm glad they finally finished the anime with another season. This is one of those rare stories where you wish you could live in that world with the characters. I laughed, I cried (seriously, the end left me a misty-eyed). It has a lot of heart, and that is central to the story in a very important sense. Despite what appears to be a simple story actually has a lot of depth. While InuYasha is the title character, Kagome is in many ways the real protagonist. There is a yin-yang relationship between the two, where InuYasha defeats the external obstacles with his fighting prowess, while Kagome defeats the internal obstacles where it requires her to be strong and wise enough to hold her group together and do the right thing no matter how much it hurts. The only downside is that they do repeat the prologue story over and over whenever the plot progresses, but that's understandable considering a long-running series will need to recap to catch people up who watch this on TV rather than a single DVD marathon.",1493942400,,1015,4.644444444444445
7045485,5,B00UIR8IW2,Great ending for the Series. Totally recommend buying this box.,1493337600,,63,5.4
7045486,5,B00UIR8IW2,"The story was clearly planned and written with great care and the animation is absolutely top-notch.  This is a must-watch for fans of the series.  With that being said, make sure you watch everything else you want to see (first series and movies) before watching this, because this is truly the definitive end to the series.  When you're ready to see the end of this epic story, The Final Act will not disappoint.  Without any doubt, this is some of the best anime I've ever seen.",1492473600,,481,4.558139534883721

7045496,4,B00UIR8IW2,"I absolutely love this show,  but the change in the voice actors has ruined the enjoyment entirely.  It nearly makes me wish i had never seen it.  Why did the voice of Kagome not finish what she started?",1487116800,,203,4.2894736842105265

7045507,5,B00UIR8IW2,I love every episode of Inuyasha! I still remember it well when I was a child. At first I was really bothered by the new voice actor for Kagome but I eventually got used it. I have waited a long time to see the final ending of Inuyasha. Other than that everything came in great condition plus fast delivery.,1478908800,,307,4.220338983050848
7045508,5,B00UIR8IW2,"This final series nicely tied up the loose ends and even had a satisfying ending. I came across the original Inuyasha on the now defunct ""Adult-Swim"" on the Cartoon Network cable channel. Due to various reasons, I did not see the 7th season until only recently, so I was completely surprised the 7th was not the last series. I took a new look at the series recently with my 10-year old son and was *very* surprised the last episode of season 7 left the story dangling. He and I were much relieved to get ""The Final Act"" from Amazon. We both enjoyed the closure.",1478736000,,561,4.403846153846154

7045511,5,B00UIR8IW2,"I've read the negative reviews, but honestly don't understand what all the complaining is about.  Maybe I'm not enough of an anime critic, but I found the replacement voice actors to be just as good as the originals.  I might have detected a few variations, but that was probably because I'd already read criticism that brought my awareness to it before watching; even then, it didn't affect my enjoyment in the least.  The story itself is wonderfully done/continued, and every episode is packed full of drama and action, along with the same humor I've come to love in Inuyasha.  I think The Final Act wraps up the series PERFECTLY, and am 1000 times glad I purchased this despite the negative buzz.",1476835200,2,699,4.75206611570248

7045513,2,B00UIR8IW2,Not bad the voice for kagome is throwing me off I miss Monica stori voicing kagome the guy who plays sesshomaru I don't mind at all I don't know if this certain dvd is different to buying the final acts 1 and 2 seperate would be any different or not but it feels off the first episode example you see kohaku and kagura talking then it just skipped jumps to koga fighting an enemy and kikiyo talking anyways I guess I'll try the other DVDs and the story just don't seem to grab my attetion like the other 7 season but it is nice to see a ending to the show was a good ending to a great show,1476144000,,589,3.957983193277311

Some of the main characters meet their doom, and others meet their destiny. And yes, Sesshoumaru-sama is all throughout it, very much so.
Enjoy it, as I did. ""Part 3""? I've got to somehow convince Rumiko to create an ""offshoot"" of InuYasha, called ""Sesshomaru"". Wish me luck.

7045538,4,B00UIR8IW2,"This wraps up the anime series nicely. The first couple episodes were hard to listen to because the old voice actors were trying to figure out their voices again and the new voice actor for Kagome takes some getting used to. After a few episodes I got used to the new Kagome and I think she did a very good job over all. If you are an Inuyasha fan and we're frustrated with how the 7th season ended, then you definitely need to watch this to gain some closure for the series.",1453075200,,475,4.173913043478261

7045540,5,B00UIR8IW2,"Ok first I just want to say that I loved loved LOVED this anime growing up and I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. I was always up late watching it on Adult Swim. I would have to say I was addicted and I still am. I had just finished watching every season of InuYasha before I bought this. I was ecstatic when it finally came in the mail and I just had to watch it. The case and the artwork on the discs are beautiful. I love the way they look. I loved the way they ended this anime but I'm sad that its over.

The only thing I dislike about The Final Act is that Kagome and Sesshoumaru's voice actors are different. I didn't really notice it too much with Sesshoumaru but the actress that voiced Kagome really bothered me.",1449532800,7,742,4.082191780821918
7045541,5,B00UIR8IW2,"Just finished watching ""Inuyasha - The Final Act"" released by VIZ Media.
""Inuyasha - The Final Act"" is a rousing climax to one of anime's and magna's enduring series.
The demon Naraku is nearing his final endgame of corrupting the purity of the Shikon Jewel and killing Inuyasha, Kagome, and their friends.  Spoiler Alert - a lot of characters die as this series draws to its long awaited conclusion.
In order to defeat Naraku, Inuyasha and Kagome must look deep inside themselves and set aside previous notions if they are to succeed in destroying Naraku, and in order to free herself from a trap that Naraku had set upon his death, Kagome must speak the words that may cause her to separated from Inuyasha forever.
""Inuyasha"" has long been a favorite anime series of mine when I first began watching it on Adult Swim all those years ago.  These final 26 episodes are fan's dream come true and make for captivating watching.

7045544,5,B00UIR8IW2,"I had watched the original anime series and couldn't wait to see it receive a proper final conclusion.  There are four disks with a total of 26 new episodes.  The first three disks are fantastic.  The animation is amazing; lush, detailed, bright colors.  The episodes have all the humor, sadness, and action of the original.  The episodes contained on the final disk, however, drag on (and the setting of these episodes doesn't allow for the animation to shine - which cannot be explained without spoilers) before reaching a satisfying overall conclusion.  If you loved the original series you simply must get this however.  The extras are a bit minimal.  The trailer from ""Neo Alley"" is very good.  I'm not sure why they couldn't include textless openings and endings as that is pretty much a given nowadays.",1447200000,4,809,4.889705882352941
7045545,5,B00UIR8IW2,"I liked that this anime picked up with the end of the InuYasha tale, because having watched the start of the story, I really wanted to know how it ended.  I enjoyed the original series, but I could see where they might have wanted to cut to the chase a bit with the story, since some of it seemed to move somewhat slower than the action-oriented pace they seemed to be going for with the anime.  At any rate, I think fans of the original will be pleased with how the different threads of the story are wrapped up; I know I was.  I also really liked the art on the discs, as well, and was all around pretty happy with this product.",1445126400,,630,4.105691056910569
7045546,5,B00UIR8IW2,"I resent that Kagome's and Sesshomaru's voice actors had to be recast, but whatever. David Kaye's replacement is very much acceptable, but not Moneca Stori's. I give major respect to both Michael Daingerfield and Kira Tozer, but while the former actually does sound very similar to David Kaye, Ms. Tozer doesn't sound anything like Ms. Stori. And Kagome's the main character, so, well... Too bad.

It's a great finish to a long-running show. I think there were only 3 fillers this time around. I might be wrong, but I've only seen The Final Act once.",1444694400,,550,4.7894736842105265

7045548,5,B00UIR8IW2,"Dubbed and subbed, I was very disappointed that the voice actors changed for Kagome and Sesshomaru (probably a couple smaller guys too) but that's not the sellers fault. Perfectly shipped and exactly what it says, get it.",1441411200,2,221,5.0
7045549,5,B00UIR8IW2,"Inuyasha is my childhood anime period. There has been no anime that I've had a longer obsession with and to say I waited for a REAL ending to the show is a major understatement. But... It was worth it! The blue-Ray has both part 1 & 2 of the last act unlike the normal DVDs which has the 2 acts divided. So in my mind to get the blue-ray is a much better deal.
  The art of the anime is beautiful. I'm very happy with it. Now in the English version some of the voice actors are different. Which is understandable due to how long ago the normal show ended. But as a person that usually loathes that... I actually found this one very tolerable. Mainly Kagome, to me personally, is the most noticeably different, but as I said, the new voice actor does a good job so I give her a pass. Inuyasha, Miroku, Naraku, and Sango are the same as always.
  I loved the last act! As a fan since the 3rd grade and now in college I am very happy!",1440806400,25,931,4.0710382513661205

7045551,5,B00UIR8IW2,"I was surprised when I heard that some voice actors where different from the original series. Kagome is the main one but as I watched the show, I got used to her voice and it didn't bother me as much. I absolutely loved this season! There was no fillers and every episode had a point and I enjoyed that. I'm also glad that Sesshomaru was in this season more because he has always been one of my favorite characters. I'm glad we got to see more character development in him. I'm only missing the two seasons before this one and once I get those, I will have the complete collection along with the movies. Inuyasha was the first anime I ever watched when I knew what anime was and it's been 10 years since then and I have never looked back. It has always been a beloved favorite.",1439769600,3,777,4.256756756756757
7045552,4,B00UIR8IW2,"Kagome'a new voice is tiring, and dosen't reflect her character at all. All in all, it is good ending to this feudal fairytale. Plus, the face Sheshomaru pulled in the epilog had me laughing for at least an hour after it was all over. XD",1439078400,2,237,4.288888888888889

7045555,5,B00UIR8IW2,"At last.  All in one box.  The entire Final Act series is presented for anyone who was waiting for a single 'box set'.  Be warned that there are no real extras here.  The second and fourth disks have some extras, including a scroll of translations of the Japanese cast and crew and a very limited list of the English dub cast.  Be aware that the acting credits for a lot of the guest characters are missing.  This is basically just a repackaging of the Part 1 and Part 2 Blu-rays / DVDs in a single package.

The Blu-ray transfer is beautiful true 1080p with DTS-HD audio.  Note that the 1.33:1 aspect ratio listed in the item description is wrong.  This is true 16:9 high definition.  The 5 stars in the review is just for the quality of the disks and the beautiful art on the packaging.  The discs also contain the original Japanese language presentation with optional subtitles.  Unlike the English dub, all the original Japanese actors returned and full credit is given for all roles.

The problem with the English translation was the inability to get several of the main cast to return.  The major roles of Kagome, Sesshomaru, Kaede, and Kohaku were recast with mixed results.  The new voice for Sesshomaru was excellent, though different; but the recast of the Kagome role was a disaster.  The new actress was not able to either render a reasonable imitation of the original or emote in a believable way, which detracted from the overall experience.  All of the returning cast members gave respectable to excellent performances.

Now I should mention that this part of the series is extremely truncated.  Manga material that in the original series required 56 episodes to present was compressed into 26 here.  Needless to say, huge passages in the manga were completely omitted and the rest extensively rewritten to fit into the number of episodes allotted.  This completion of the story was not treated with the same care and respect that the original series got.  In the first episode alone, 15 chapters of the manga were represented and they were scattered all across the first 150 chapters of the un-animated part of the story in no particular order.

This is repeated for the first 14 episodes of the series, making for a very disconcerting and hard to follow viewing experience, as I have seen from questions asked about it elsewhere.  It also affects the pacing, which is breakneck in the beginning and slows considerably as the episodes progress.  If the original pace had continued, the final six episodes would have all been compressed into one.  ""Extras"" are sparse and include an ad for Viz's Neon Alley web site and a partial listing of the English voice cast at the end of the 2nd and 4th discs, which is exactly how those discs were released in the original 2-part division of the series on disc.

Not to give away any spoilers, this series picks up right where the old one left off with Naraku safely escaped and our intrepid heroes regrouping to pick up their search for him once again.  Only now all the related groups begin to converge on their quarry and interact with one another more closely.  We also get to meet a few new characters, both foe and non-foe, as the battle intensifies and some tough choices have to be made in order to arrive at the final confrontation, and its aftermath.  The good news is that the story is wrapped up more or less completely, with very few loose ends left.

If you want to see the ending of the story as originally intended, read the manga from chapter 339 to 558.  It will explain a lot of what is happens as short, disjointed scenes in the anime.  It would have been nice to have had a few more extras; but that has not happened.  This is mostly intended for hard-core fans who really wanted to see the ending of the story in animated form.",1438473600,12,3805,4.621460506706408

7045560,3,B00UIR8IW2,"I was really looking forward to this final season but it really disappointed me. In order of most to least annoying:
1. The writing is awful. Not to say that the original inuyasha was a masterpiece but the newer script is painfully bad - at least personally, I found it painful.
2. The characters act differently. Partly because everything is gapping so fast, they don't give the time needed to develop the character changes: for example inuyasha saves sesshomaru a couple times and sesshomaru isn't even irritated by it.
3. Like states above, the story is rushed along. Personally I haven't read the manga but those who I've talked with that have, also note that the story is rushed through in this last season of the show. Compared to the original series, The Final Act is severely lacking the emotional/suspenseful pauses.
4. Kagome and Sesshomaru are voiced by different people - it is noticeable but I honestly think if the first 3 promblems were fixed I could I overlook the voice changes.

Overall if you're a fan of inuyasha, like me, you should watch The Final Act just to get the closure - but don't expect it to be like the older episodes.",1435881600,2,1150,4.665024630541872

7045566,4,B00UIR8IW2,"I waited for, and preordered the complete version of Inuyasha: The Final Act because I didn't want to buy/have it separately in 2 parts. I'm quite happy with my order. The only thing I dislike is Kagome's new voice actress, can be very annoying for fans of the original series dubs.

When I received The Final Act on DVD, I immediately rewatched Inuyasha seasons 1-7 start to finish, in preparation. When I got to The Final Act, Kagome's new voice bothered me. I feel that it sounded like ""high-pitched overacting"", and even a little distracting at times. At times I found myself turning the volume down and the subtitles on.

All of that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the story. And all of the other (English) voice actors returned, for those who may be wondering.",1434240000,19,768,4.681481481481481

8706977,5,B00UIR8IW2,"If you've been wondering what Inuyasha and the rest of the main cast have been doing after the end of the original anime came to a rather abrupt end then have no fear, as Sunrise returns to the series with The Final Act. A 26 episode swan song to one of Shonen Sunday's best series and Takahashi's greatest works. The Blu Ray itself is fantastic, the picture quality and sound are terrific and the extra's (while minimal) are a nice touch, including production art, storyboards, and trailers. But the main menu's have absolutely no sound whatsoever, which is really strange. The series can be watched dubbed or subbed in Japanese. What's also cool is that most of the voice actors from the original series including Richard Ian Cox, Kirby Morrow, Kelly Sheridan, Scott McNeil & Paul Dobson with the exception of Moneca Stori & David Kaye return to reprise their respective roles, though the replacements for Kagome & Sesshomaru do a fine enough job voicing them. Overall, the set is a must own for any fan of the series and you owe it to yourself to see how it all ends.
