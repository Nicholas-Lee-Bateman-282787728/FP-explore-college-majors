Catholic, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Anglican, Mennonite and most other branches of the Christian faith are represented by their spokes-persons.  Their are extra hours of interviews that are not covered in the 3 hour HD presentation plus virtual tours of places of interest during the Reformation era.  You will not be disappointed.",1477785600,17,383,5.568965517241379
7763901,5,B01GKB2EC4,"Well done!  Nicely explores both the accomplishments of the Reformation as well as the resulting schism.  Balanced, informative, and optimistically points to a day to come when the people of the Kingdom understand and live in unity.",1502755200,,232,5.243243243243243
7763902,3,B01GKB2EC4,"This Changed Everything: 500 Years Of The Reformation just aired on PBS.  I concur with other reviewers that the documentary is a 5-star historical synopsis of this turbulent period and the bloody consequences which reverberate down through history, but I give it 3-stars for what it omitted.  The intermingling of church and state into theocracies (e.g., Calvin's Geneva) should be especially relevant to Americans wary of current conservative legislative agendas which aim to install a Christian Nation.  The program traced the separatist puritan (pilgrims) who fled European persecution to these shores in 1620 only to practice their own version of intolerance.  The influx of other religious factions later inspired a progressive solution to the chaos: The First Amendment.

The Reformation, although initially motivated by contempt for perceived church corruption (e.g., sale of indulgences), rapidly morphed into a political process between competing factions who stood to gain or lose power, if not their lives.  Kings and Queens, Popes and Reformists, strategized their positions on various doctrines to satisfy their egos and sentiments, oftentimes reversing course with a resented predecessor, resulting in wild policy swings.  Alliances were struck, abandoned, and restored as the political landscape shifted.  It was game on!  People play games, not God.  When people say God is telling them what to do, watch out, somebody's gonna get hurt.

While the prize was establishing favorite doctrines about God, it was not apparent that God (or love) was present in these disputes whatsoever.  Worst of all, doctrinal disputes were all-or-nothing fights.  The loser not only was deemed a heretic, but branded as evil and a threat to humanity.  Many so-called heretics were tortured to death (burned, drowned).  Surely God never got involved in these disputes, just pious men who claimed to be speaking for him.  The program could have done a better job of pointing out this distinction, nor did it unsanitize the scope of violence associated with the Thirty Years' War and other tragic events.  Was the brutal execution of Michael Servetus mentioned?

The third and final installment ended with commentary from contemporary theologians (ranging from Bishop Barron to Frank Schaeffer and Shane Claiborne) on ecumenicalism and the need to reclaim common ground.  They seemed to insinuate that Christians once had the ""truth"" at the time of Constantine or before, but divisions arose because people are fallible.  The panel never entertained the possibility that the church got Jesus wrong from the get-go (e.g., Did Jesus want a religion formed in his name?  If so, was Paul the designated architect?)  To me the real value of studying history is to avoid repeating mistakes.  The panel also did not comment about the global scene which encompasses Islam, Hinduism, and other religions.

Conspicuously lacking was an outside-in perspective from philosophers and more objective parties.  Of course the likes of a Bill Maher would say if there is no God, then the whole bloody religious mess was power politics by other means, but if there is a God and Protestants and Catholics rightly slaughtered each other in God's name, then that would be divine insanity.  Either way the Reformation is a black eye.  Now we have tens of thousands of Christian denominations.  Which one is right?  Answer: Mine.  See the problem?  It's worse now than then, but we don't kill each other over it much anymore...mostly due to apathy.

500 years have transpired since Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the Wittenberg church; the Magisterium had run its course.  Now the Nones and Dones are the fastest growing religious category; Sola Scriptura has run its course.  The Catholics and Protestants have had their day.  Now what?  The panel suggested damage control.  I say don't look back, move forward.

Incidentally, the program failed to mention (to my recollection) that as much as Luther embraced Sola Scriptura, he disputed many books in the Bible and tossed out the apocrypha.  You can just shrink God's Word?  You can do that?  Seems like a big deal to me, just on principle.  How can a book be holy and inerrant if you're disputing major portions and tossing others away?  I contend the doctrine of purgatory is an important component in a belief system which incorporates justice and proportionality, that is if you think of it as a place of rehabilitation and correction.  If God is love, then God is fair.  Anyone can game ""grace,"" the hallmark of the Reformation, by playing Pascal's Wager.

The program zeroed in on transubstantiation as a main bone of contention, but it's hard to imagine such nuanced positions leading to great division unless this was really about that; that being who gets the final say.  Doctrines borne of Calvin (a French lawyer) such as predestination and providence are far more divisive.  Did the program mention TULIP?

I predict the next reformation will reject the inerrancy of the Bible and usher in a post-religion era of doctrine-free spirituality and humanism.  It's well underway in Europe where cathedrals are museums.  People stop believing Bible stories and church doctrines not because they want to ""sin,"" but because they just don't think they're true.  Conversely, other people will continue to cite Bible stories, especially the OT variety, because the stories excuse their deeds and support their politics.  But that's not faith, it's rationalization.

People want the truth.  Truth is, truth is an elusive thing.  I contend the truth is not something we once had but lost, rather it's something we're perpetually seeking.  Our understanding of God is evolving as our understanding of DNA and space travel.  In many ways the church is stuck in a medieval time warp.  It's increasingly apparent that neither the Pope nor the Bible are inerrant.  That distinction rests with God alone.  Problem is, God is mysterious.  Religion is happy to fill the void with dogma, but modern people are more educated.  Less and less are going to blindly swallow.

Even in a post-religion culture, people will find secular doctrines to fight over.  The polarizing dispute between Left and Right, Liberal and Conservative, is quickly emerging as the new ideological battlefield as we grapple with immigration, income inequality, and resource depletion.  But like the Reformation, God will sit this one out too.  I'm done with churchianity, but I'm not done with God.

God is love.  Life is eternal.  Those are the only two doctrines I cling to.  Nothing to fight about there.",1492473600,4,6606,5.160226201696513
7763903,5,B01GKB2EC4,"Excellent presentation of the reformation.  I am Lutheran, David Suchet is a devout Catholic.  I was impressed by the fairness and accuracy he showed.  All sides were represented in a unbiased way.  Strongly recommend.",1490745600,2,218,5.323529411764706
7763904,5,B01GKB2EC4,"I knew some names involved with the Reformation and other bits and pieces of this history, but this presentation put the story together in a very intelligible way that I found very informative. It also follows the story right up to today with conversations and initiatives that are happening to bring the people of Faith together as God desires and Jesus prayed for. Many voices are represented in the presentation and there are extensive interviews in the bonus material, so a very comprehensive overview of Church history and thought over the past 500+ years.
Highly recommended as an introduction from which one could dig much further if desired.",1488672000,,649,5.018518518518518
7763905,5,B01GKB2EC4,"The timing could not be better for a new documentary about the Reformation!  I have already been incorporating segments of this wonderful resource into high school modern world history courses.  ""This Changed Everything"" has a combination of insightful commentary and effective visuals that were thoughtfully and carefully crafted together with clear purpose.  In the words of Alan Trachtenberg, ""The historian's task resembles the photographer's: how to make the random, fragmentary, and accidental details of everyday existence meaningful without the loss of the details themselves.""  ""This Changed Everything"" provides an awesome level of detail summarizing the events of the Reformation while at the same time keeping focus on how these events are still relevant for us today, 500 years later.",1488585600,6,797,5.6722689075630255

The makers incorporated the views of a wide range of scholars, both Protestant and Catholic.

8763106,5,B01GKB2EC4,"I loved the beautiful cinematography, fantastic historical overview and the perspectives of different theologians/historians across denominational lines.  The third hour may rub some people the wrong way as it explores questions of where the church as a whole is headed and if there is any hope for unity, but the history provided in each segment sheds light on these questions and I think helps believers think critically and come to their own conclusions.
