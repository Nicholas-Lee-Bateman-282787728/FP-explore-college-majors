Thus, I decided to start with this introductory dvd, thinking my whole family could benefit from this.  I will also admit, I'm only about 2/3 of the way through this dvd.  I'm sure the concepts and some historical references are well-explained for the sacred geometrical ""novice,"" however, the presentation is quite mundane, (and I'm not a picky person).  The presenter has a very thick French accent, and even with my years of French in school, I have to listen very carefully to understand what he's saying (in other words, I have to concentrate harder on hearing his words, and am missing some of the concepts).  But what's more difficult, is, it looks very low budget to me.  There's one man, talking about the concepts, standing in front of one sacral symbolic background--and they show a lot of profile shots of him talking that are quite annoying.  Sorry, I guess I'll go back to finding books on this topic (any book ideas, please mention in your reviews:)",1211846400,6,1068,4.7405405405405405
