8396291,5,B003FZW7VC,"As a parent we always worry on how well our kids will do and how we can, one way or another, make them the best compared to others, but at the same time we always worry about our ability to teach them. Luckily there is learning material such as the Shapes and Colors that is designed to make our job so simple that it's almost incredible. My kids in fact are able to count from 0 to 10 and backwards even before going to school.",1316131200,,428,4.047058823529412
8396292,5,B003FZW7VC,"The thing I liked about this DVD is that really teaches what it claims and is fun too. My kids quite enjoyed this DVD and ask to play it several times. They liked the story line and have learned counting from it. Its a fun, cute product. There is a cute song where ducks on a wall sing the numbers in reverse. I think that's a great idea! Besides that, the animals and the main character in this DVD make it an entertaining and educational DVD covering fundamentals - counting up to 10, counting in reverse, some basic math. Good DVD - definitely recommend it!!",1279670400,5,561,4.352380952380952
8396293,5,B003FZW7VC,"Preschooler Learns Numbers and Counting With Animals from Galloping Minds is a great DVD for children from 1 to 4 years of age. This DVD will teach your child all about counting from 1-10. It is also educational in other areas such as different species of animals and different places around the world.

The main character is Mr. Twiddles who has lost his pet lamb Doodle. He flies all around the world to look for her and speaks with many different animals along the way. The video does an excellent job at introducing young children to basic mathematics such as addition, subtraction, more than, less than and equal to. It has a pleasant classical music soundtrack playing in the background.

The DVD grabbed my son's attention immediately and he was fully engaged for the entire 30 minutes. He even wanted me to play it again for him immediately after it was over. His favorite part of the DVD was the song about the 10 little ducks that sit upon a wall and fly away one at a time. I thought that was a clever way to introduce subtraction to my little one. It does a great job at getting my son to interact with the show by posing questions throughout the film. I often hear him answering the questions, it's so cute!

I like the pace of the DVD, it goes slow enough to allow the lessons to really sink in but fast enough to keep his attention. It really makes learning fun which is something that I am always looking for since it is so hard to find. I am really looking forward to trying out some of the other Galloping Minds products in the future. I would highly recommend this DVD to all parents who have young children between the ages of 1-4. It would make a nice gift as well.",1275350400,6,1686,4.380191693290735
