Which is a great shame, as there is probably a great treasure trove of these old Communist propaganda films that are worth releasing for general Western viewing.  I've seen portions of them in several documentaries. None of them are on the level of an Eisenstein, of course, but Lenin realized early on the importance of films as a means of reaching the masses, and Stalin took every effort to build up the Russian film industry to almost world-wide standards to spread the news and propaganda of the Glorious Revolution and the need to defend it against its enemies foreign and domestic, which he knew were everywhere, certainly in his head.

""Lenin 1918"" looks like a very good film.  Set at the height of the Russian Civil War, when the fate of the Glorious Revolution was in grave danger (pity the White Army didn't try harder), it shows how there was nothing to worry about with Lenin in charge.  Here we see dear, sweet Ilych in calm control of things, seeing various visitors from a few local friends to the great writer Gorky, showing grave concern for the people's plight, dispensing counsel and advice no doubt based on the teachings of Good-Time-Charlie Marx, even taking the time to adopt a poor little orphan girl, it seems.  He travels around and gives speeches.  Meanwhile, a small group of counter-revolutionaries are meeting to shoot and assassinate our dear, sweet Ilych (which is historically true; they wounded but didn't kill him).
 But this Chinese version is heavily edited.  Some of the things not included are his meetings with dear, sweet Stalin, who was in firm tight control of things when this movie was made so it showed just how involved he was with the war (when he was mostly involved with some local administration and paper-shuffling at the time, with some fierce local enforcement on the side) and how eager-beaver friendly he was with dear, sweet Ilych (which was probably true as far as how far Stalin wanted to advance in the scheme of things).  The problem with that is how badly this editing effected the film.  From what I gather from other sources, Stalin was a very prominent figure in like the last half of the original, meeting with Lenin, overseeing battles on the field, finally appearing behind the great leader at the end of the war and, I think, the film. He must have a good fifteen-twenty minute appearance. But apparently because of heavy disapproval against Stalin by the Chinese Communists, the film comes to a sudden end, with no suitable conclusion, just an absolute stop.

I hope this film, and other Russian films like it, will be one day restored, subtitled and put into general release for the rest of the world to see.  In addition to being a culturally pertinent film, if a piece of propaganda can be regarded as such, I found it highly enjoyable.",1421971200,,3031,4.75047619047619
