80217,5,0788860119,"In a time when children's shows are nothing more than mind numbing eye-candy, it's refreshing to revisit these movies.  However, as a twenty-year-old lifelong fan, I feel a bit offended when the Muppets are so  quickly dismissed as children's entertainment.  The Muppets are amazingly  complex and contain much more than catchy tunes and colorful characters.  I've grown up with these guys (Gonzo will always be one of my heroes!!) and  watching them in early adulthood is just as fun as watching them at four.  The songs, the jokes (many of which younger viewers wouldn't understand),  the cameo appearances (Uncle Milty and Steve Martin are my favorites), and  all the greatest Muppets (Kermit, Gonzo, Fozzy, Mrs. Piggy, Crazy Harry,  Sweetums, Lew Zealand, etc.) add up to entertainment of the highest  caliber.  This isn't a children's movie, this is anyone's movie. (Now if  only they'd rerelease The Muppet Musicians of Bremen...)",927244800,,936,5.201342281879195
80218,5,0788860119,"When Jim Henson died, the world lost one of the best creators of children's entertainment!  This movie is Henson at his prime.  Kermit and Fozzie, travelling the nation, gathering all their muppet friends.  I taped  ""Rainbow Connection"" on a handheld recorder the night it aired on  national television.  I played the song on my piano!  Now, as a fifth grade  teacher, I still use parts of the song as quotes in my classroom. Everyone  should watch this movie with the children, grandchildren, parents and  grandparents.  Fun for the ENTIRE family.",927072000,,548,4.977777777777778
80219,5,0788860119,"No children's movie has ever come close to capturing this kind of innocence and magic. As far as I'm concerned, this movie replaces ""The Wizard of Oz"" as the greatest children's classic ever made.",916444800,,196,4.794117647058823

80265,5,0788860119,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I have been watching this movie since I was 11 years old and I am 48 now and I still love it and even own the sound track.  My wife and my kids think I am wacky but it brings me so much joy and memories.  Everyone should own a copy of this to share with their family.  My favorite quote from Kermit the Frog...""Life's like a movie, write your own ending.""  So true...enjoy everyone!!",1484524800,,428,4.0476190476190474
80266,5,0788860119,"This movie is my childhood. Every Christmas -- or thereabouts -- it would be shown on broadcast TV (in an age where a young child like myself had no other option to watch it). And every year I would watch it, and enjoy all of the things children do about the Muppets.

Now as an adult, I can report that this movie has grown with me. Now I can appreciate some of the underlying trepidation and melancholy that a child would never even notice. (How would you describe the tone of Gonzo's haunting desert song? And what do you suppose is the ""voice that calls the young sailor,"" that possibly draws Kermit on to his own destiny? And why does the movie set fall apart in the final sequence of the film? These are not questions for a child to consider, let alone answer.)

But forget all that. It's there, but it doesn't really matter. What matters is that this film is beautiful, and if you hold the beauty of childhood within your heart -- at any age -- this movie can reach you.",1484179200,12,977,4.304347826086956
80267,5,0788860119,"THE BEST OF THE BEST OF THE BEST OF THE BEST!!!!!! I love every second of this movie with my heart and soul. It causes me to deeply guffaw every time. The writers were high on life and the trippy details and meta-structure (a movie within a movie within a...the levels are endless and it's very self-aware) are endlessly satisfying. Thank God for the 70s, when children's movies were made for adults. To all this, I say Huzzah. THE BEST.",1483747200,,437,4.475

Forget that it's the original and that all the ""real"" voices are there and that the humor has a level that transcends generations as well as a sophistication that delivers laughs for everyone. Forget the over the top plot devices, sets, props and staging. Forget all that and remember that movies from this era were done completely by hand as it were and given a heart from true craftspersons who are now largely gone from the industry. Yes great movies are made every year, but one and those like it are from a time that saw a rush of creativity and boldness that has faded from the stage and is being replaced by digital smoke and mirrors.",1481241600,,674,4.487804878048781

It is a fun movie to watch with my son, and he enjoys the singing and theatrics- keeps him engaged and he laughs at all the right times, which is so cute.

I will say, I had trouble with the orders, and am awaiting my fourth order-  I have spoken with Amazon, through their CHAT option, and it was pretty easy to do, no problems with refund and the CHAT option was quick and easy.  Talking to the people on the other end of the chat seemed easier than talking by phone.

80465,3,0788860119,"So .... this movie came out before I was born. I have been on a mission to watch all of the Muppet movies since my interest in them was piqued with the 2011 Muppet movie. A lot of the older movies have held up very well (such as Muppet Treasure Island), but the older the movies get, the more you can tell how old they are.

The biggest problem with the older movies is pacing. In the 1970s and 1980s it seems to have been more acceptable for the plot to just kind of meander and/or go nowhere.  This movie, in particular ... DRAGS in a LOT of places. Even when it isn't dragging, the plot just isn't all that interesting.

However, that being said, there are a lot of celebrity cameos in the movie (including Mel Brooks, which I was NOT expecting, and totally loved), and there are quite a few genuinely funny scenes in the movie. Additionally, the back story I have gained from watching these older movies has helped flesh out my understanding of the Muppets much more than it used to be.

3 stars :)",1394409600,,1002,4.285714285714286

80532,1,0788860119,"The Muppet Movie, sadly, has to receive a terrible review, here- through no fault of its own... other than being the first unlucky experience I've had with this new corporate trap door.  Again, my review IN NO WAY stands as a rating of, or reflection on, the movie.  (The movie, as you should know by now, is worthy of more than 5 stars, because it is one of the best films aiming at pure family entertainment in the last 50 years.)  However, it is proving most ironic that the protagonists in this film are trying to go to, uh... Hollywood.

BECAUSE-

Hollywood studios seem determined to screw us over with their aggressive monopolizing of the ill-fated ""Digital Copy.""  I have immediately canceled all my bluray ""combo"" pre-orders-- ones that I was buying, in part, because of the inclusion of a ""Digital Copy,"" because such a thing clearly no longer exists.  The studios have systematically eliminated the possibility of a digital file, which you and I may download, keep indefinitely, and sync with our iTunes devices (which, let's be honest, is all we care about).  Instead, they are cajoling and arm-yanking us toward their online streaming nonsense.  In short, this ""Digital Copy,"" though billed at the top of the Bluray the same way all others that have, thus far, been compatible with my iTunes and its devices have been billed... DOES NOT WORK WITH iTUNES.  NO iPad.  NO iPod.  NO iPhone. (You CAN download, say, the Amazon streaming app onto those devices-- just go and SEE the raving reviews of THAT app on iTunes!)  NOTHING on the package- anywhere- owns up to this fact.  NOTHING.

Obvious and intentional deception.  Score another moral victory for the Mouse House.

That may sound harsh, but it's warranted-- because the package would suggest to you that this is, in fact, a ""Digital Copy.""  At LEAST when other companies (WB, Sony and etc) have changed the plan related to their ""Digital WhateverYouWantToCallItNow,"" they have had the decency to be plain about it in the packaging.  Not so, here, and a huge incentive for me to buy this was the (-old idea of the-) Digital Copy.  They have stolen from me by deceiving me.  Wow...  Disney.

I'm eager to see this new transfer of a classic film from the 70's, and wish it were enough to make me want to slightly amend my review, to reflect what I still hope is a high-quality print transfer.  But that just won't happen.  Won't be enough.  This is simply the last straw.  It's clear, what was a dawning new day of ""Digital Copy"" glory is sullied and finally spoiled by a storm of corporate greed, which always seems to charm itself with this sort of naked, unabashed trickery.  It's sickening... a sucker punch.  And it spoils what otherwise would be a great cause for celebration: ""The NEARLY 35th Anniversary of the original, classic Muppet Movie.""

No Making Of specials, just nothing to care about.  Yet, in another recent blu ray release Disney's ""Oliver and Company"" which was not successful had a DVD & a Making Of special.

80539,5,0788860119,"When Jim Henson wanted every Muppet in the grand finale of his first feature film to be operated by a person, rather than being static or electronic (there was no CG in 1979), the call went out for performers to converge on the studio where it was filming. Among them were a young animator (Burton) and a fledging filmmaker (Landis).

And while The Muppet Movie was the first feature for the Henson crew, it was the last for legendary ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, whose Charlie McCarthy character was a forerunner for figures that transcended their technology. It didn't matter that Bergen's lips moved, or that he when he was on radio there was no visual, Charlie McCarthy was a living breathing soul, just as Kermit and Miss Piggy are, regardless of whether you can see the puppeteer.

When you see The Muppet Movie, you are seeing the cutting edge in puppetry and an endless procession of celebrities. Even though both are still impressive and make many current billion dollar special effects extravaganzas of today pale in comparison, what stands out is the clever script, the music and the unearthly talent of the Muppet performers.

Even though The Muppet Movie was a major release in 1979 and a huge hit, it has a gentle smallness, almost an underground film feel. Though it looks better than I've ever seen it on Blu-ray, there is a marked difference between this film's image and sound quality and that of the Muppet films that followed.

If you're a Monkees fan, The Muppet Movie is helmed by the same director of much of that series, a nice blend of the fourth wall breaking style of Monkee and Muppet.

This new ""Nearly 35th Anniversary Edition"" includes Frawley's test footage of The Muppets in natural settings - a feature well worth the price of the package that was left off the 2005 DVD edition.

Perhaps the major stars of the film is not seen but heard - the musical score and songs by Paul Williams and Kenny Ascher. ""The Rainbow Connection"" has become a standard, while the song that took its Oscar, ""It Goes Like It Goes"" from Norma Rae, is largely forgotten.

As such, since I had to open the movie to find out the limitation, I am now stuck with it.

On the bright side, it is a great movie, a hallmark of my youth.  I just wanted to share it with my nephew on AppleTV and I have been robbed of that.

The Muppet Movie, after its initial VHS edition, has been trimmed by several moments (probably only adding up to around less than five minutes) on DVD. The Henson catalog has been whipped around various distributors, including Disney in the 1990s (who put the film out on LaserDisc) and then Sony on DVD.

I'm loving that the new Disney packaging has somewhat restored the intention of the original theatrical posters: hopefully the film itself, in undergoing its new high-definition restoratitive transfer, will finally have these moments retained.

An easy way to tell is to run the ""Magic Store"" finale from the CD soundtrack and spot the differences: there is more score in the song on the CD - which is the first thing that alerted me that the film had been previously cut - which then led me to go back and check other scenes.

I have a VHS tape with the full movie presented in ""open-matte"" format, the way the movie was filmed. This Disney edition should present the film in matted widescreen (correct) at 1.85:1 - and hopefully they will have gone back to earlier elements and, knowingly or not, present the full uncut edition of the film.

I'm a Muppet nut - my Dad worked with Jim in London on The Muppet Show and Great Muppet Caper - and this is my favorite Muppet movie. I'm hoping that some original test footage shot by director Jim Frawley around the English countryside where they were making The Muppet Show (and was on the Sony DVD) is again included, and that other footage that I know was filmed makes it into a ""making of"" featurette, old or new.

80563,5,0788860119,"This great movie paints a picture of Hollywood as a grand place full of wonder and magic, a place where the Muppets belong.  I wonder if any movies today could do the same.  Could they make Hollywood look like a place whose very purpose is to bring happiness to millions of people?  Could they have cream of the crop guest stars in every cameo role from ice cream man to waiter, where no one's ego gets in the way and draws attention away from Kermit and his gang?  I have my doubts.  This may be one of the last great Hollywood movies, with great comedy and great songs (except for one song I'm not crazy about).

Kermit is one of the greatest characters ever.  In my opinion he runs circles around Mickey Mouse.  He's always humble, modest, and attempts to do what's right, but he also won't take any kind of guff from anybody.  He knows when to take a stand.  And he knows how to act in front of both children and adults without patronizing either.  This movie is really a tribute to his greatness.

This movie's only flaw is that it is sometimes EXTREMELY cheesy.  But you know, what can you expect from a puppet show?  It's a wonder that it's so extremely clever with wonderful writing throughout.  I think my favorite line is when Fozzy says, ""I don't know how to thank you guys,"" and Kermit adds, ""I don't know WHY to thank you guys.""  Hilarious.  And there's a cool ghost town scene in the movie too that I wasn't expecting.

I'm not sure if I like the Muppet Movie more than the Muppets at Disney World, but man, it's still really good.",1255132800,,1545,4.3426573426573425
80564,4,0788860119,"The Muppet Movie is full of humor that the whole family can enjoy and the plot moves along at a very good pace. This is a very entertaining film that will charm your kids and the child within you, too! The cinematography is particularly well done and the special effects are quite professional.

When the action starts, we see Kermit The Frog singing about life in his swamp. Although he is happy there, he soon meets a Hollywood agent by chance who tells him that Hollywood is looking for talented frogs to audition to become stars--and very wealthy stars at that! Kermit can't resist temptation and so he starts his way to California.

Along the way Kermit meets a host of the most popular Muppet characters. He encounters Fozzie The Bear, a stand-up comedian who isn't always all that funny but who has dreams of fame and fortune anyway. Kermit also falls in love at first sight with the glamorous Miss Piggy at a beauty pageant; and it's clear she feels the same for him. He meets musicians in a church who call themselves ""The Electric Mayhem"" and he also meets up with a dog that plays piano in a bar where the Muppets spend a night on their journey.

But all is not smooth for Kermit and his friends. Their car breaks down--and the second one breaks down, too! How will they get to California? All through the movie look for special guest star cameos by the likes of Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Orson Welles, Milton Berle, Steve Martin, Dom DeLuise and more. There's also the very menacing and potentially deadly enemy Kermit encounters, Doc Hopper (Charles Durning) with his sidekick and chauffeur Max (Austin Pendleton). It seems that Doc Hopper owns quite a few restaurants that serve frogs legs and if Kermit doesn't become the ""spokesfrog"" for the advertising campaign Doc Hopper intends to have Kermit killed!

Will they all make it in time for the auditions in Hollywood? How will Kermit keep away from Doc Hopper? What about Kermit and Miss Piggy--will they stay in love or is it just a passing fling? No spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out!

Unfortunately, the transfer from video to DVD is less than perfect. In fact, it's not good at all. The picture is rather grainy and that is such a disappointment. We do get some stock footage of director Jim Frawley's ""screen tests"" for these Muppets; but the footage is again very poor quality. The ""Muppetisms"" are also rather superfluous. I'm taking off a star for all this! I also read that other reviewers are upset with some editing out of Kermit ordering a drink in a bar; I agree with these reviewers that they didn't have to cut this small part out of the picture.

Overall, The Muppet Movie is something you can enjoy with your family; and it's just the right length for most kids older than five or six to sit through it without getting restless. The songs are excellent and despite the poor transfer to DVD it's worth it to have this DVD in your collection especially if you have kids who would appreciate this type of film.",1232323200,,3016,4.617537313432836
80565,5,0788860119,"I was only 10 years old when this movie came out, in '79, and after seeing it once or twice, in the theaters, I was hooked on it! Then, when it was shown on cable, I recorded it on video cassette so that I could watch it whenever I want. Then, a few years ago, after it came out on DVD, in 2001, I ordered my own copy of it. I love this movie for many reasons: the multitude of Muppets characters such as Kermit The Frog, Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Gonzo The Great, Dr. Teeth & the Electric Mayhem, Rowlf the Dog, etc., the many guest stars like Steve Martin, James Coburn, Paul Williams, Carol Kane, Milton Berle, Mel Brooks, etc., the plot, in which Kermit, after being discovered by a Hollywood agent, played by Dom Deluise, leaves his home in the swamp, heads west to Hollywood & picks up other Muppet friends, along the way, who have the same dream of being famous & in showbiz. But, during the journey, Kermit has to avoid a despicable fellow named Doc Hopper, played by Charles Durning, who wants Kermit as his spokesfrog for a chain of french-fried frog legs restaurants that Hopper's planning to open. I also enjoy the soundtrack, especially songs like ""The Rainbow Connection"", which was the favorite song of my mom (God rest her soul), ""Moving Right Along"" and ""I'm Going To Go Back There, Someday"", which is my favorite song. What I really like is the dialogue, especially the funny lines, such as when Kermit & the Hollywood agent are talking about alligators, and Kermit says, ""Read my lips, all-i-ga-tors!"" or when Kermit & Fozzie go into the church where Dr. Teeth & the Electric Mayhem are playing, they look at each other & Fozzie says, ""They don't look like Presbyterians to me!""

80567,5,0788860119,"I've always loved the Muppets since childhood. There's something about a comedy troupe hiring its own hecklers I can't help but respect, but I try to be impartial when I rate movies. Still, I find it hard to picture the kind of soulless monster who couldn't enjoy this film.

Only the Muppets could have Eliot Gould host a beauty pagent judged by Charlie McCartny and Edgar Bergan at a fair where Richard Pryor sells balloons, and NOT botch it up. This film has a great sort of zany energy about it that brings to mind movies like Peewee's Big Adventure or Blazing Saddles. (You can imagine my delight when Mel Brooks appeared as a Nazi mad scientist with a penchant for Frog Mind Control. Probably his best on screen performance.) But where Blazing Saddles is extremely offensive and Peewee is absolutely insane, this film is about something. It's an uplifting yet gently cynical tale about people who dare to follow their own dreams.

Sounds like your typical kid's movie flack, but even I was taken in by it.

The film opens with Kermit in his swamp singing a song called ""Rainbow Connection."" (Believe me, the movie's worth it just for the song!) An agent (named Bernie The Agent) paddles out, makes some small talk, and upon realizing the frog's talent, offers him an audition in Hollywood. Kermit delines: ""I'm happy just where I am."" ""Yeah, but someone like you could make millions of people happy."" Kermit decides to take the audition. Later he admits to himself how miserable he was in the swamp.

He journeys to Hollywood picking up puppets along the way, but there's a snag. The CEO of Doc Hopper's French Fried Frog Legs restaurant chain wants Kermit to be spokesman, and he'll stop at nothing to have him. By the way, I do mean NOTHING! He kidnaps, he extorts, he hires a crazed Nazi scientist, a hitman who specializes in frogs, and a posse armed to the teeth with shotguns. I think if he had a nuke, he'd use it.

I don't care how old you are. See this movie! It's a masterpiece to be cherished by anyone who was moved by Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, Singin' in the Rain, or (especially) The Wizard of Oz.

The story is enchanting. The music is charming and whimsical.  The muppetry is fantastic.  It is hard to imagine a better opening to a movie than the rainbow connection sequence.
The movie is a cornucopia of awesome quotes.  I think my favorite still remains: If frog's couldn't hop, I'd be gone with the Schwinn.
The cameo roles are excellent as well.  Steve Martin excels as a put upon waiter.  Dom Delouise is impressive as a hollywood agent adrift in a swamp and Mel Brooks steals the show as a german mad scientist.",1086220800,44,760,4.378571428571429
80573,4,0788860119,"I had the pleasure of introducing my two and half year old son to the magic of the muppets through DVDs of the original  ""The Muppet Show"", the syndicated TV program, that I had watched and enjoyed, while growing up in the 1970s. He loved Kermit & company's surealistic, yet hilarious comedy and music, so the next logical step was to move on to the Muppet's various adventures on film. Luckily, the first DVD I bought was the original 1979 film, ""The Muppet Movie"". The plot is quite simple. In his hometown swamp, Kermit meets up with a lost and nervous agent (played by the ever hammy, Dom DeLuise) who informs him that a major Hollywood studio is looking for frogs with talent. Armed with a dream of making people happy through his dancing and singing, Kermit goes on a road trip to the West Coast to break into the movie biz. Along the way he picks up new found friends Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the Great, Miss Piggy (starting their long running, tumultuous romance), and the rock group, Dr. Teeth & the Electric Mayhem, who all share in dreams of Hollywood fame .Unfortunately, Kermit also gets the attention and ire of Doc Hopper (Charles Durning), a Col. Sanders knock-off, who wants to force our hero to be the spokesfrog for his fast food, frog legs chain, ""alive or stuffed"". What an adventure! This is a wonderfully entertaining film, which will appeal to both kids and adults alike. Its obvious, that Muppet creator, Jim Henson and his fellow performer, Frank Oz were at their creative peaks. The writing is sharp and never 'dumbed down' (""I think I've lost my way""...""Have you ever tried Hare Krishna?"") and the musical numbers are well staged (including Kermit's now classic, ""Rainbow Connection""). What's more the film is filled with entertaining cameos from 1970's Hollywood including Madeline Kahn, Richard Pryor, James Coburn, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Steve Matin ETC. My son and I have now collected all the DVDs in the Muppet's cannon of films and we pretty much agree, that this movie is by far, the best of the lot!

I grew up watching the Muppets. Now in my twenties, I get a kick out of watching them all over again with my kids! They are so funny! I can't believe how many adult jokes are in these films that went completely over my head as a child! I laugh at these movies just as much as my kids do (if not more!)
They are all great movies. My favorites are The Great Muppet Caper and Muppets from Space. But all four are excellent!
The Muppet Movie is The Muppets first full length feature film! Kermit heads out for Hollywood after being discovered by a big time talent agent who tells Kermit that he is destined to be a star. Along the way to Hollywood, Kermit makes friends with the cast of loveable Muppets: Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the Great, and Miss Piggy. Together they decide that they are going to be famous movie stars and embark on a journey where they run into other famous movie stars: Bob Hope, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle, Mel Brooks, Dom DeLuise, Elliott Gould, Steve Martin and more!! But the evil Doc Hopper starts chasing after them because HE wants Kermit (or, his legs anyway) to do the advertising for his Frog Legs company! When he kidnaps Miss Piggy, Kermit rushes to the rescue and falls right into Doc's trap! Now they have to find a way to escape and still get to Hollywood before Doc makes Frog leg soup out of Kermit!!!
The Great Muppet Caper is full of action, adventure, and humor! Kermit, Fozzie Bear, and Gonzo all work for a Chicago newspaper and travel to Great Britain and vow to get to the bottom of the robbery of Lady Holiday's diamond necklace - and end up meeting a ton of Muppet friends along the way! There are special guest appearances by: Jim Henson, Frank Oz, Dave Goelz, Jerry Nelson, Richard Hunt, Steve Whitmire, Loiuse Gould, Kathryn Mullen, and more!
Muppets Take Manhatten is a story about an aspiring Broadway director, Kermit the Frog... He has written a musical that includes all of his Muppet friends and he has finally found someone who will produce it on Broadway!!! But, a week before opening night, Kermit gets hit by a car and smack his head on the ground and gets AMNESIA! Kermmit doesn't know who he is or where he is, so he creates a new life for himself and gets a job at an advertising agency on Madison ave. Now his Muppet friends can't find him and the clock is ticking down to show time! The hunt is on - they turn over every rock of Manhatten looking for Kermit... can they do it before the show is completely ruined??
And finally, in Muppets From Space, Kermit takes a back seat for a change to Gonzo The Great! Gonzo begins to feel left out of the loop - he has no family members and really has no clue of who he really is. But when he gets a message from his relatives from outer space that they are going to come pick him up, he tries every way possible to try to communicate with them! Everyone thinks Gonzo has lost his marbles - but when word gets out on Miss Piggy's talk show, UFO Mania, a secret government agency captures Gonzoi and will do ANYTHING to find out when his alien relatives are coming to earth! So it is up to his best firends: Kermit, Rizzo, Foozie bear, and the hilarious Pepe to save Gonzo and make the earth safe for his relatives to land!!!

In an age when movies from the 50's are restored to crystal clarity, this treatment of a movie from 1979 is unacceptable.  But another problem is that the movie just isn't very good either.  Sure, we all love the Muppets.  But look objectively at the movie itself.  The plot about the villain trying to kill Kermit feels too nasty given the overall light tone of the film.  The assassin brought in to shoot Kermit with a speargun is especially creepy.  Of course, scary elements in kids' films have a long and respectable history.  But here, they feel out of place.  Another problem is the utterly moronic level of much of the dialogue and the extreme overacting.  Yes, I know, it's a kids' film.  But Disney has shown us how kids' movies can entertain adults as well.  Although it has its moments, The Muppet Movie nevertheless features scene after scene of really lame dialogue, jokes, and plot points.  A key example is Mel Brook's cameo as a German mad scientist.  He enters the scene clicking his heels like a member of the Gestapo.  Do we really need Nazi references in a Muppet movie, even if they are from Mel Brooks?",1065571200,9,1232,4.638888888888889

- Animal (reason enough, right?) the crazy drummer for the Electric Mayhem

Since that summer I have watched it countless times, and even though I obviously already know how things are going to turn out, I still enjoy every viewing as much as the first.  It never ceases to amaze me how well this movie was made.  I love the way they introduced each character to the plot, and how everyone had their own, distinct personality.  The list of guest stars was an amazing achievement in itself.  But my favorite part of the whole movie was that Studebaker.  I can't believe that so many years later I still dream of owning a car just like that one, and it's all because of this movie.  It always struck me as really sad that they left that car behind after only nineteen minutes of the movie.
I still enjoy listening to the soundtrack.  So many catchy, unforgettable songs.  Magic.  Simply magic.  I could listen to Rainbow Connection over and over.
I've seen several of the other Muppet movies done since this one, but somehow even the good ones just don't measure up to this one.  They found a magic that they were never able to duplicate, and which is absent in so many other movies, as well.  Each time I watch it, I can't believe how disappointing it is to have the movie end.

Sadly, the DVD version manages to water down those fond memories a bit too much.  The picture quality is average at best, on par with a good VHS print, but nothing near what it should be in its own format.  The film is just too grainy at times, the colors too washed out in others.  Unfortunately, it looks as dated as it actually is.
Add to that a strange sound mix that seems way too low during all of the dialogue and then way too loud during the songs, and you have yourself a pretty poor DVD.  Rarely does the soundtrack sound like it's even in stereo.  The entire field of sound has a decidedly smushed feel about it, and is entirely too flat.  It was extremely annoying to keep turning the home theatre system's volume up and down during the entire movie to balance out the spoken parts vs. the songs.
Still, The Muppet Movie is the best of the lot when it comes to the Muppets' movies.  It manages to retain its original charm despite its transfer flaws.

I say classic because it maintains the energy of keeping children at the forefront of the story in regards to the audience and still entertains the adults that watch as well. Did you know it was released in 1979?
Directed by James Frawley (Alley McBeal, Smallville) this is the Muppet version of how the Muppets got to Hollywood and became famous. Along the way the meet a string of characters that either help them along their way or actually are trying to prevent them from doing anything.
Haven't you ever wondered how Kermit the Frog met Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonnzo, Rolf, Animal, Rizzo and the rest of the Muppet clan? There is even a cameo by the original Big Bird! (He's on his way to Public Television on the east coast - while Kermit and friends on their way to Hollywood on the west coast.
Stars like Milton Berle, Charles Durning, Richard Pryor, Madaline Kahn, Mel Brooks, Steve Martin, Orson Wells, Cloris Leachman, Charlie McCarthy and Edgar Bergman, Dom Deluise and many many more make cameo appearances.
In the end, the make if of course but along the way take the audience along with slapstick, bad jokes, one-liners and music. One of my favorite tunes includes Moving Right Along and the best one of all, The Rainbow Song sung by Kermit when he opens the film.
The DVD extras include trailers and a little excerpt of the camera tests being done by the crew to see how the Muppets would actually look on the big screen. Cleverly done and full of magic, wishes and dreams this is a fun, fantastic family film and another must for your collection.",1035676800,6,1653,4.587837837837838

80590,5,0788860119,"When Jim Henson first introduced the Muppets to the big screen, I'm sure he had no idea how they'd take off. But the care and thought that went into this production assured that they would.
What the Muppets have arguably lost over the years in evident in this film in spades. Their goofy, childlike humor is counteracted by a higher, more sophisticated level of humor. Yes, sophistacated humor. Such cameos as Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Bob Hope, and Mel Brooks -- though they appeal to kids on some level -- are mainly there to entertain the adults in the audience. This movie accomplishes what so many kids movies today fail to do -- be enjoyable for the entire audience.
The added features on the DVD are a bit slim, but Jim Frawley's camera tests alone are worth it. Kermit explaining to Fozzy that he's not a ""real"" bear (just a small piece of the camera tests) is simply hilarious.",1028851200,,909,4.617283950617284

80592,5,0788860119,"""The Muppet Movie"" which was released in 1979 was the first step into motion picture land for Jim Henson and his Muppet family.  What a big step that was!  It is sometimes very difficult for TV personalities to make the transition into film, but this was done very easily and smoothly by The Muppets and their popularity soared even higher.  So it's safe to say this film not only appealed to youngsters, but also to their parents and grandparents, who sat right along side them, enjoying every minute of it.  According to 'Variety' September 12, 1979, ""Along with the predictable family biz, much of the audiences were 40-60 year olds, well acquainted with the Muppets from their syndicated vidseries.""  There was something for everyone in this movie: the antics of Kermit and all his pals for the little ones and the silly little offbeat jokes for the older people.
The plot was simple enough so that even the youngest children could follow along with it.  Kermit The Frog (Jim Henson) is sitting in the swamp, by himself, playing his banjo and contemporary life. Dom DeLuise, a Hollywood agent, who happens to be passing by on his way fishing, ""discovers"" Kermit.  He shows him an Ad in Variety for open auditions for frogs that want to become rich and famous.  Naturally, Kermit wants to become rich and famous and so he hits the road to Hollywood. Along the way, he picks up a bunch of ""Muppet"" friends who also want to join him in his quest.  These new found friends, Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy (both played by Frank Oz), The Great Gonzo (Dave Goelz), and the rock group Dr. Teeth (Jim Henson) and the Electric Mayhem (Frank Oz, Jerry Nelson, Richard Hunt and Dave Goelz).  Their journey to Hollywood is filled with danger, obstacles, laughter and fun.  There are cameo appearances by Steve Martin (a nasty waiter at a restaurant), Mel Brooks (a crazy scientist who wants to get a hold of Kermit's brain), and Charles Durning (as Doc Hopper who would like to hire Kermit as a walking advertisement for his chain of fried frog's legs restaurants).  Needless to say, there's never a dull moment for this group of travelers nor are there too many minutes between songs.  In the end, Kermit and his friends finally get to Hollywood and the rest is history.
The most well-known song from the movie is ""Rainbow Connection"" which is sung by Kermit at the very beginning, while he's sitting on a log in the swamp, meditating about life.  Before you know what is happening, he's in the car, with Fozzie Bear driving on his way to Hollywood.  They glide into ""Movin' Right Along"" which is another popular and well-known song.  While Kermit is in a restaurant with Miss Piggy, she gets up and walks out on him.  He and Rowlf, the piano player, team up to sing ""I Hope that Somethin' Better Comes Along.""  This song is a spoof of getting along with women (""You can't live with 'em, you can't live without 'em""). The grand finale, ""The Magic Store"" stars all of the Muppets when they're on the set of their new Hollywood movie.  This is a reprise of the ""Rainbow Connection"" with some other lines built in to more personalize the fulfillment of their dreams.  'Newsweek's' movie review of July 2, 1979 states, ""The innocuous score by Paul Williams and Kenny Ascher, is the lease effective component of the movie...""  I do not agree with this statement.  The songs in the movie were what made the movie a hit because The Muppets were known and liked for their singing and performing, not for their acting.  TV audiences watched their variety show because it was The Muppets and they enjoyed their singing, dancing, antics and notable guest stars.  But, most of all, they enjoyed their songs.
I first saw ""The Muppet Movie"" when I was 8 years old. (I must admit, I've seen it many times since then and I still listen to the soundtrack.)  I liked the movie then and I still enjoy it for the same reasons even though I'm older.  These Muppets almost seem real in the movie because of the expertise of their creators.  They do many things in the movie, which are unbelievable.  I enjoyed the naivety of these characters, the wholesome and simple ways they solve their problems, the uniqueness of each of them and the lively songs they perform.  ""As do the other actors in the movie, we very quickly come to accept The Muppets as real people who just happen to be made largely of felt."" ('The New York Times' June 22, 1979)  The creator of The Muppets, Jim Henson, who died in 1990, will be sadly missed for his tremendous contribution to the world of entertainment.",1019952000,4,4550,4.63013698630137
80593,5,0788860119,"Is ""The Muppet Movie"" on the same level of quality as ""Casablanca"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffanies""? What about ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Gone with the Wind""?
I'd like to think that a seven year old might consider this among the greatest films ever. With no heavy message, ""The Muppet Movie"" is sheer joy. The singable songs, the colorful characters, the incredible silliness of it all make it a movie worth watching with your family without hesitation.
As a DVD, you won't find many of the extras you might see on other films, but the kids won't care. In fact, as fun as the trailers are, your young ones simply want to watch the movie.
I first saw this movie as a child, and still know the words to ""Rainbow Connection.""
I fully recommend ""The Muppet Movie"".

They don't get all of the jokes because they are targeted mostly at adults, but it's still a lot of fun watching them watch the movie.  Kermit and Fozzie are one of the best comic teams since Abbott and Costello!  I also loved the cameos by Carol Kane, Steve Martin, and Orson Welles.  I am still amazed by the scene of Kermit riding the bicycle; when my five year old sees it, she screams, ""HOW DO THEY DO THAT????""

80596,5,0788860119,"The first big screen appearance of The Muppets is probably the greatest. Kermit on a bicycle, Fozzie driving his uncle's Studebaker with Kermit playing navigator, Piggy winning the 'Miss Bogen County' beauty pageant, Animal taking an ""insta-grow pill"" with hilarious consiquences and the fact that everyone around them accepts them in their ultimately human society.
The DVD release of this movie (only on American-region 1 format) was inevitable but I also hoped there would have been more in the way of ""special features"". Although, I have to admit, 'Jim Frawley's camera test' was worth the money alone. This was footage that was taken to show what the Muppet's would look like out in the open. Until the release of 'The Muppet Movie' they had only been seen in the Muppet theatre and Jim Henson wanted to show that they could look as convincing in the ""real world"".
The main feature hasn't had much of a clean-up but is presented in wide-screen. Who needs a digitally remastered version of the film when the original wide-screen version is availale? Although the picture is a little drab (don't forget the movie was shot in 1978) the sound has been remastered into Dolby Digital.
The ""Muppetisms"" are a little strange but fun. They remind me of the greetings cards you used to be able to buy.
All in all, it would have been nice to see some extra Muppet features from the seventies instead of new Muppetisms and trailers from the newer releases from Jim Henson Home Entertainment. How about the original featurette of the movie as included on the 'Labyrinth' DVD release? There must have been one made.
Either way, it is The Muppets we're talking about and if, at a later date, they decide to re-rerelease this movie with extra special features I'm sure the millions of fans out there will oblige and re-purchase 'The Muppet Movie'. I know I would!",995068800,,1852,4.808777429467084

Their warm and hilarious dialogue is convincing to me even now as a 23 year old. Henson and Oz were truly jedi masters of their trade. It's disappointing that the recent Muppet releases are lacking the magic that the first three movies had. I can't wait to share this film with my daughter.  I like the fact that it is a fun family movie but it still manages to reveal real profound contemplations on life and relationships and dreams without overkill. I will never tire of this film.

80598,4,0788860119,"I could literally go on for hours and hours (or pages and pages) about how simply wonderful the original Muppet Movie is. Dialogue from this film has seeped its way into my wife's and my daily conversations. When giving directions the term ""Bear Right"" is always immediately followed by ""Right Frog."". When trying to get the other to lend a hand a monotone ""Help. Help. This is a serious cry for help"" will get the other up and to their side faster than anything else. Princess Bride is the only flick that has permeated itself more into our wedded subconscious.
The songs are immensely humable. The soundtrack has existed in our home on vinyl, cassette tape and is now sitting in our CD Jukebox in constant rotation. Movin' Right Along is the first thing to escape our lips on long car trips and I Hope That Something Better Comes Along was played at our wedding.
I won't even go into the cameos because they are a cacography of the time the film was made. Everyone wanted to be seen with the Muppets.
This is one of my favorite films of all times. That's what makes this review so hard to write.
These chunks of emotion and inspiration wrapped up in felt and fur deserve better than this. The bonus features on all the recently released disks are sparse at best. All come with ""Muppetisms"", very short commercials that I assume ran on TV at some point. They are at most 30 seconds long and, while amusing, really only whet the appetite.
The Muppets Take Manhattan comes with an interview done with Jim Henson, but it is spliced and diced up so that between each question the viewer is returned to a menu and forced to prompt the disk to play the next segment. At the minimum a Play All option should have been added.
There are literally tons of additional supplements that could have been added. Skits done on Saturday Night Live, Rowlf's appearances on the Jimmy Dean Variety show and Kermit hosting the Tonight Show would have been great. A feature length commentary with Frank Oz would have gotten me to turn handsprings. Toss in a DVD Muppet encyclopedia or a copy of the PC game that came out a few years ago and my head would have just exploded with a burst of confetti!
I can't not recommend this movie just because of the lack of supplements, but I don't have to be happy about it either.
I am sure that somewhere down the line there will be super-duper, ultra-collectors versions of these films and I can't wait for that day to come. Princess Bride was originally released in a similar version with no supplements and I was just happy to get it on disk and in Widescreen. There is now a two-disk collectors edition in the works coming out in September of this year. (2001). I guess they just saw me coming.",994377600,3,2717,4.490909090909091

80602,5,0788860119,"Simply put this is the finest Muppet film of them all and easily one of the best family films of all time.  There are quiet little messages of hope and humanity hidden beneath the hijynx of the characters that is somehow missing in subsequent films (especially Muppets From Space).  From the Muppets interacting in the ""real"" world to the famous 'Kermit riding a bicycle' scene, everything presented here was fresh and new when it came out and suprisingly, retains that feeling today.  You'd have to have a heart of stone not to find this film charming, funny, uplifting and just all out entertaining.  It's just too bad it received such a mediocre DVD release.
On the plus side, the film is presented in both it's widescreen (anamorphic!) and formatted versions with a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.  Plus there is a very funny, though hard to hear at times, screen test showing Kermit and Fozzie in different real world locations.  It must've been to see how believeable the Muppets could be in our world, but unfortunately no context is given on the DVD.  There are a few trailers you can choose to see as well as an odd feature called ""Muppetisms"".  They're simply 30 second to a minute long segments featuring a muppet or two being wild and crazy.  What they're from or supposed to be about is beyond me, but they are fun to watch - once.  The biggest problem with this DVD is the picture quality.  Not only is it grainy, but the colors seem to bleed into each other through out the film.  Worse the color tends to lean towards the red end of the color spectrum.  Why more care wasn't taken in transfering this film is beyond me as it's a classic and one of Jim Hensons landmarks.
Don't let these failings and oddities sway you from owning this masterpiece though if you don't already own it on video.  A film as sublime as this with so many levels of enjoyment for all ages shouldn't be missed.  It should be (and is) treasured.",992563200,3,1933,4.546242774566474

There is plenty of sly mature humor to entertain the parents, not to mention the fact that for most of us older folk we can still vividly remember watching Sesame Street and The Muppet Show back in the 70s and 80s.  For us, it's a pleasant walk down memory lane.  For the new generation, it gives kids the chance to discover the magic of Jim Henson that they're so sorely missing.  They just don't make family films like this anymore.  The only films in the past few years that come close are the ""Babe"" and ""Toy Story"" movies.  Sadly, none of the recent movies featuring the Muppets ever quite captured the magic of this first film.  ""Christmas Carol"", ""Treasure Island"" and ""Muppets in Space"", as well as ""Elmo in Grouchland"" were all pretty good as far as kids films go, but you could definitely tell that they suffered as a result of Jim Henson's absence.

A  timeless classic, and a view of the real genius of Jim Henson.",961632000,,359,4.205882352941177
80614,5,0788860119,"My 20 month old son adores this movie, as do I. We have watched it once a week for the past year. Kermit and the gang have a way of captivating an audience, no matter how young or old. The movie was well-produced, and  having ""real life"" actors, like Steve Martin, makes the movie  complete. More muppets in the new millenium, please!",953596800,4,334,4.370967741935484
80615,5,0788860119,"A fantastic film, and unique in holding something for any age group.  Often dismissed as a film for kids only, it contains passages that only adults could truly appreciate, most notably Rowlf's meditation with Kermit  on relationships.
But not available on DVD?  And the Great Muppet Caper  isn't available at all?  AAAAAAAARRRRRGH!  I am glad that the Henson kids  are safeguarding their father's legacy, but the number of Muppet films,  videos, and records that are out of print is simply staggering.
Come on,  you guys, get these films pressed to disc post haste!",950659200,10,566,5.0
80616,5,0788860119,"This is one of the first films that I ever remember seeing, and it is still one of my favorites today.  This story about the Muppets' cross-country excursion to Hollywood is beautifully told through the  wonderful vision of Jim Henson.  It answers the question about how the  Muppets first came together, and offers the audience a glimpse into the  lives of the various eccentrics that made up 'The Muppet Show'  before they  became famous. My favorite is, of course, The Great Gonzo, the ""prince  of plungers.""  His out-of-this-world weirdness always adds more fun to  the chaos of the situation, as Kermit and Co. try to outrun the evil Doc  Hopper and make it to Hollywood on time to audition.  I also love the big  Studebaker that Kermit and Fozzie drive around in as they sing ""Moving  Right Along."" All of the songs are memorable, from ""Rainbow  Connection"" to Gonzo's ""I'm Going to Go Back There Someday.""  I have seen this movie a million times and I will watch it a million more.  It's just one of those films that you can never get tired of viewing.",945302400,21,1059,4.60752688172043

80618,5,0788860119,"This movie has been one of my favorites.  I am glad I have it on video to watch whenever I feel down or just want to laugh.  It gives a break from the real world.  It also makes you wonder how to react to a puppet.  Though  Kermit and company are not just 'puppets', talking to a man-made character  that is operated by someone is very strange thing.  But for each of them  they have seperate characteristics.  I appreciate this movie more since I  have actually spoken to a true puppet that had character.  Like most kids  who watch this movie and can still imagine, I would love to meet a Muppet,  even if I do know how it works.",928972800,,631,4.158333333333333

7791003,5,0788860119,"As  a  kid  I  enjoyed  this  movie  quite  often.  Out  of  all  the  Muppet  movies  that  were  made  &  produced  this  has  got  to  be  the  best.  I  don't  enjoy  the  other  Muppet  movies  as  much  as  this  one.
I  still  watch  this  one.
Its  a  very  funny  movie  from  start  to  finish.  Kermit's  idea  about  going  to  Hollywood  comes  from  someone  he  met  in  the  swamp  an  agent  (Dom Deluise)  Who  seems  to  be  aware  of  Kermit's  talent.  The  songs  are  wonderful.  He  begins  his  journey  on  his  bicycle,  Too  bad  about  his  bicycle.  He  soon  meets  Fozzie,  Him  &  the  piano  player  weren't  doing  all  that  good,  So  Fozzie  realizing  he  wants  a  little  more  attention  Joins  Kermit  on  his  Journey  to  Hollywood.  Their  only  obstacle  is  a  business  man  named  Doc Hopper  (Charles Durning)  who  sees  him  dancing  just  before  leaving  the  bar.  &  will  stop  at  nothing  to  get  Kermit's  attention  &  get  him  to  help  him  with  his  advertisements.  Kermit  just  zooms  away.  Not  giving  up  that  easily  Doc Hopper  tells  Max  to  follow  that  frog.  Kermit  makes  new  friends  along  the  way.  Their  idea  for  distraction  on  the  car  is  interesting.  You  know  what?  I  kind  of  like  Dr Teeth,  if  theirs  one  thing  he's  good  at  its  smiling!  &  good  humor.  He  is  one  of  my  favorite  characters  out  of  the  Muppet's.  If  he  can't  make  you  laugh  none  of  them  will.  Gonzo  is  also  hilarious  him  &  his  chickens.  This  is  one  exciting  adventure  not  only  for  the  Muppet's  themselves  but  for  us  as  well.  This  movie  really  does  bring  back  a  lot  of  memories.  Its  too  bad  its  not  available  at  my  local  video  store.  Although  who  needs  them  anyways  when  I  can  find  most  of  the  movies  I'm  looking  for  here  on  amazon.  I've  tried  finding  my  favorite  movies  at  the  video  stores  or  a  video  store  in  the  mall,  No  luck.  So  I've  decided  to  stick  with  Amazon  from  now  on.
After  days  of  being  chased  Kermit  finally  loses  Doc Hopper,
I  kind  of  liked  his  advice  what  he  told  Doc Hopper,  (I  don't  think  your  a  bad  person,  But  I  think  if  you  look  in  your  heart  you'll  find  you'll  really  want  to  let  me  &  my  friends  go,  &  follow  our  dream.)  He  almost  got  through  to  him.  Doc  was  using  almost  every  trick  in  the  book  to  get  Kermit.  From  there  they  head  on  to  Hollywood  which  is  how  Kermit's  story  ended  up  in  the  theaters.  &  Miss  Piggy  I  liked  her  too.  Today  now  I  am  ready  to  enjoy  this  movie  again!  If  your  like  me  &  you  love  to  travel,  friends  you'll  love  this  movie.  That  clever  frog  irons  out  every  little  kink.",1522972800,,2835,4.20479302832244
