4597797,4,B0057Z9V62,"The creators of Shimmy have really put a lot of effort into designing a show that introduces the beautiful art of Belly Dance. This is definatly a dvd for beginners but as a Belly Dance teacher myself I have often used the episodes as a way to warm up my body since they are short but sweet.

Visuals - I am in love with the look that Shimmy has created. It feels so magical & I often get lost into the feeling of the show. After researching this show I discovered that most of it wasn't filmed with a green screen but instead they have actually created the setting with fire & snow which is fantastic. Also the dancers & the costumes are lovely and are certainly the cherry on an already beautiful cake. The only thing I would say is that the camera does switch about a lot so when you are trying to focus on a move it can sometimes be a little difficult. Also some of the locations are a little strange (such as the shopping mall stairs).

Music - The music has a good mix of modern & classic Middle Eastern sounds. It is actually such a shame that the music has not been realesed as a CD as I would love to use it in class.

Dancers - The dancers are talented & there moves are quite big which helps the viewer to see how to do the move. I also enjoy watching the little sections in between the teaching so I can see them dance naturally.

Teaching - The teaching is very clear & at a good pace for a beginner. They don't force too much on you in one episode but rather focusing on 4-6 moves & then putting them together. Some moves in the later episodes might be a little tricky for beginners but it gives you something to work towards, I mean if it wasn't challenging it would just get boring easily.

A fantastic dvd to introduces the magic & beauty of Belly Dance & I shall continue to recommend this to my students.",1311638400,27,1823,4.152974504249292

The variety of women in the series is also very refreshing, and they all have different body types making it easy to relate. I love how Shimmy teaches the moves slowly and with control. My favorite part is when you perform the final routine of everything you learned in that episode. It's very similar to how dance classes are tought; so if you love dance, you'll love this.

I was young then and enjoyed learning the new steps in my living room when the show came on, but now I can have the same enjoyment anytime! Shimmy is a powerful muscle toning DVD which doesn't allow you to think of how boring working out can be or how much bellydancing can hurt because it's that enjoyable. You will feel a difference after your first workout if you're really giving it your all. Highly recommended to beginning bellydancers and workout enthusiasts looking for a new jive.",1424131200,2,548,4.435643564356436

4597830,5,B0057Z9V62,"I'm really pleased to have found this series again after it was canceled from Fit TV.

Each Season contains 12 episodes each. What I love about the Shimmy series is that it breaks down the basics of belly dance over a span of episodes, not just an hour DVD. I have purchased several belly dance workouts in the past, hoping to get some practice and lessons outside of the classes I took in person and was always disappointed... for serious learners, this is a must series.

In season one, there is a lot of introduction to basic moves.

Every move is broken down to the bare basics with baby steps, detailing which parts of your body should be moving at each moment (The narrator is very specific and makes such a big difference in this series). Each episode teaches about 3 to 4 main moves, and then at the end, you combine your moves into a beautiful dance using everything you just learned (the narrator leads you through each step of the final dance).

It's really enjoyable and highly recommended.",1406419200,5,1002,4.55

My wife and I remember this show on Fit TV years ago and when we came across it on Amazon, we knew it would be a good purchase (to switch up from her yoga and pilates DVDs).  First off, we are both physicians and admire the warmup exercises that are presented before each lesson.  They utilize common postural stretches in a manner most can relate to.  The only unfortunate aspect is that the stretches are not fully instructional.  We wish they would tell the person not to over do the stretches, what the proper postural positioning is, and that you should only do a stretching feeling a mild pull/stretching sensation (other than that can cause physiological stress and/or damage).  Remember, they are experts, and you are beginning.  Do not expect to be as flexible as them, at least not right away.  However, this is just two physician's point of view, and honestly, it is more informative than any other exercise video we have seen.  My wife discovered, it makes you aware of muscles you never think of (lower body, core, and upper body) while teaching you ""basics"" in belly dancing (the shimmy aspects).

The backdrops are beautiful, the lessons are clear and concise, and the music is placid.  Admittedly, sometimes the camera view makes the first time of learning difficult via occasional lacks in visualization of the movements, but overall, its a great system.  We recommend both season 1 and 2 to anyone who wants a great workout at home, while expanding your dancing horizons to placid music.

We hope this review helps.",1391644800,3,1578,4.821561338289963

The cameraman was mostly focused on girls' lovely faces, cute smiles and sweaty tummies, and often fails to show the part of the body that actually performs the move. She is turning, I need to see the footwork, but I can see anything besides her feet. If I need to see a beautiful belly dance performance, I can find it on youtube.

They workout tells you step by step how to dance (so if you're a non-dancer this still should be easy for you).  It's so enjoyable you forget at times it's a workout. I believe this is a nice feminine way to get toned and feel sexy doing it.  As for any woman it's important to feel good about yourself.

This workout enhanced my already hourglass frame. also if you are a mom i recommend this. Don't be discouraged, just get something sexy to wear if you please and workout!",1381881600,,572,4.229357798165138

There are a few episodes on the second disc that if I'm not wearing my knee brace/wraps (I have runner's knee) they ache and hurt later.  Needless to say, I can't shimmy like I use to.  This series though is quite fun and each episode runs around 25 minutes long, give or take.  The steps are very easy to follow and the camera actually does a good job following the movements to show you exactly what to do.  The price keeps dropping on this item as well, so if it's a little out of range, a few more months might lower it. I also know it was very hard to find anywhere, so if you ever followed this on Fit TV you might just want to purchase it before it's too late.",1374019200,3,791,3.981012658227848

The first week that I used Shimmy I lost 5 lb and with working out at the gym I have been loosing abot 3 lb a week consistently. Great prouduct.,1317168000,2,337,3.6944444444444446
4597870,5,B0057Z9V62,"I have always had an interest in belly dancing, never thought I would do anything with it until I saw Shimmy on Fit Tv.  I just loved it.  I'd watch it everyday, sometimes twice.  I even started taking a community class. (One star).  Then one day it was gone from Fit Tv, just gone, I didn't know where to find it.  I was so crushed.  Now I have a chance to get Shimmy back into my life again.

Thanks so much!",1314748800,,410,3.9876543209876543
4597871,4,B0057Z9V62,"For a beginner or intermediate middle eastern dancer, this is great practice. There are a wide variety of steps/moves you can learn so it doesn't get boring. The instructions are pretty clear and I like Kim's voice - very soothing.

Class begins with a stretching warm-up, instruction on a move/step, practice, and then ""free-form"" time.

The cinemotography is absolutely gorgeous!",1314748800,3,381,5.333333333333333
4597872,4,B0057Z9V62,"If you think belly dancing isn't exercise just try the shimmy for a few minutes.

The dancers show you each move, building one on another. The backdrops and costumes combine to make this a very enjoyable work-out. You'll want to create your own costume.

I do wish the music was available separately. It would be nice to have it for working out. Perhaps they'll offer the music soon too.",1314576000,,387,4.594202898550725
4597873,5,B0057Z9V62,I bought Shimmy three years ago as a birthday gift to myself. I had been watching Shimmy on FitTV but was disappointed when the program ended in only half an hour. The dancers and the voice over keep you interested and engaged. I have a blast even though I imagine myself looking like a hippo in a coin scarf! Shimmy on!,1314316800,,320,4.262295081967213
4597874,5,B0057Z9V62,"The costumes, choreography and sets used in these videos are truly outstanding.  The music is fun and lively too.  I use them for exercise five days a week and never get bored.",1314316800,4,176,4.46875
4597875,5,B0057Z9V62,"I have been teaching Bellydance for over 6 years and have been dancing over 10 years. I watched this show on TV and ordered the DVDs to review them before I recommended them to my students. I think that the DVDs are beautiful. You can tell that the dancers are really bellydancers and the set and production quality is excellent. Although the terminology is different that what I call some of the moves, I still know exactly what they are doing and use the same vocabulary in my classes so that students can have cohesiveness from class to practice. The DVDs keep things pretty simple and lighthearted and emphasize good posture and technique. I highly recommend this product to people who want to explore bellydance or want a practice companion outside of class.",1314316800,16,763,4.7443609022556394
4597876,5,B0057Z9V62,"I watched this series on TV when first aired and the workouts are varied enough to provide a good selection of moves to learn. The manner in which they teach the moves is great. The dancing is more enhanced with beautiful dancers, great scenery, great music, and great costumes and practice wear. I love that the videos are not on DVD to watch and use at will. These are great for beginners to experienced dancers as it can be a learning tool or a refresher.",1314144000,,458,4.4
4597877,4,B0057Z9V62,This was one of the first belly dance instructional DVDs I bought after seeing the show on TV. I learned how to do a lot of the basic moves and how the moves are broken down is very helpful. I have since learned more from a friend of mine but this gave me a good foundation and was a nice workout as well.,1314144000,,305,3.857142857142857
4597878,5,B0057Z9V62,"The warm-ups alone are worth the purchase price. Soft music calms your mind and fires up your muscle groups, preparing them to dance. Steps are clearly demonstrated by the performers who give their all to embody the impish spirit hidden by their scarves. With excellent production values and a score that will keep your hips swaying throughout, you will find yourself returning again and again to improve flexibility and sure-footedness in your dance.",1314144000,4,451,5.191780821917808
4597879,5,B0057Z9V62,"I have not purchased this item but have done all the Shimmy workouts on FitTV, now Discovery Fit and Health. But these workouts were very fun and helped connect me to my roots when my family could not, thanks shimmy. Its very entertaining and benificial for my mind, body and soul. After doing the workouts for an entire year two years ago I can still stretch the hips and contort my body better than I ever have before. But if you are not used to this kind of hip stretching I would definatlly take it slow as not to hurt yourself. Good luck and have lots of fun with this DVD workout. :-D",1314144000,2,590,4.230088495575221
4597880,3,B0057Z9V62,"I bought season one when it was first available, the routines are fun and the step by step instructions make easy to follow along. I did seem to get a little bit of a cardio work out, but didn't notice any real physical benefits or changes. I was performing the routines 3 to 4 times a week, sometimes doing two routines to get a 45+ minute workout session. I have gotten faster and more noticeable results doing a modified kettle ball routine following the exact same diet. I am unsure whether I will try season two since I am unimpressed with season one.",1314144000,,556,4.407766990291262

4597882,5,B0057Z9V62,"Shimmy is amazing.  Every episode is a great workout, with a warmup and a cool-down, and it's a great way to learn some bellydancing.  Each episode builds on the moves you've learned before, and the beginning moves are so simple anyone can get into it.  No matter what shape you're in, you can start to build to a better level with these DVDs.",1314144000,,343,4.412698412698413
4597883,5,B0057Z9V62,"This is such a wonderful workout!  I followed along with these episodes on my television after my 1st son was born.  My body had changed in a way that I didn't necessarily dislike, but was certainly unfamiliar with.  Learning to love what I had AND tone it all up with easy AND challenging moves got me back into shape in no time!  I had even had an emergency c-section and started these workouts at about 8 weeks post-natal and was able to do just about everything I wanted.  After time my skills and energy caught up and I could follow-along with the entire workout.  I can't WAIT to buy the whole set of DVD's!!!!",1314144000,2,616,4.359649122807017
4597884,5,B0057Z9V62,"These DVD's are wonderful for the beginner or those looking for an inspiring warm up.  I do one 'episode' every morning to start my day.  Every episode starts with a warm up, and then slowly goes over 2 sets of 3 or 4 moves, then it puts them all together in a short routine.  You can definitely grow and learn with this DVD and eventually take everything you learn to create your own routines.  Nothing takes the place of going to class or a good teacher, but this is a well rounded video series to do at home.  I still marvel at the filming.  It is amazing! Every morning I enjoy the creativity of the settings and the beauty is inspiring. Truly unique of any Bellydance DVD I have seen.",1314144000,2,689,4.2615384615384615
4597885,5,B0057Z9V62,"After watching the show on TV, I bought the DVDs for both seasons.  I've been taking classes for about six years and am always looking for something to supplement them.

4597886,5,B0057Z9V62,I am so glad to find the Shimmy DVDs available at Amazon.  I had just discovered the program when the channel it aired on soon became no longer available in my area.

4597887,5,B0057Z9V62,"Shimmy is my absolute favorite workout. When the series used to air on FitTV, I used to schedule my day around it! It's addictive! The dancers are all wonderful and a joy to watch. The host has a soothing voice and the music is wonderful...it's just such a fun way to exercise without breaking a major sweat but still getting in some toning and movement. Since there isn't any jumping, it's also great for apartment dwellers! The improvement in my abs and my arms was not to be believed - after just 2 weeks, I noticed a huge difference, no more flabbiness under my arms and my abs became much more defined. They really motivated me to keep with it - so much so that I ended up taking a belly dance class to supplement my home workout. I hope they will make another season!",1313884800,35,773,4.337931034482758
