8043615,5,B0006VM0ZG,"I have missed Michael Moriority on film. He has been absent due to personal problems, but ever since his performance in ""Bang the Drum Slowly,"" I have been hooked. In Woman Wanted, we again see the ability of this man to get into the depth and soul of his character. In this movie a young woman answers an ad to work in the home of an ""over fifty"" man who is a bit stodgy, and who also has a grown son who is a ""train wreck"" living in the home.  Unable to ""find himself"" the son has returned to the nest. Kiefer Southerland plays the emotionally distraught son and he also directs the film. The son is very bitter about the death of his mother whom the father had committed to an institution where she died barely a month later. The father has had a weekend lover on the side for years, due to his lack of emotional nourishment from the mother.  The mother's break from reality was realized when she appeared in her husband's college classroom (where he was giving a lecture) barefooted, hair in curlers and it a bathrobe. With brightly painted toenails she launches a diatribe filled with profanaties. She had to be physically removed by an ambulance crew. Holly Hunter gives an outstanding performance as the live-in who has been hired to ""bring order"" to the household, and bring order, she does.  She is a fantastic cook, housekeeper and has a knack at managing the dramas in the household caused by the mental conflict between father and son. They both fall in love with her, which causes more jealousy and conflict.  Michael Moriority, Holly Hunter and Keifer Southerland. Who thought we would ever see THESE THREE in a movie together? They seem so unlikely together. But if you see the movie you will realize that they fit and fit beautifully. I have done this kind of work myself as a home health provider and you learn quickly that while you may be skilled at nursing and homemaking, your main job is psychiatrist/psychologist and there are many family dramas that you must manage or all the caregiving in the world will not make a difference. The acting is superb all round, but I take my hat off to Michael Morioity who IS his character, a character I have seen many times in real life.",1249344000,4,2197,4.526448362720403
8043616,5,B0006VM0ZG,Woman Wanted is the story of love and the need for reconciliation and understanding between a father and son and the woman who is the catalyst to that end.  All three of the main characters share a need to come to terms with the pain in their lives and move on to functionality on their own terms.  The story is beautifully told through terrific acting and the patient pacing of the film which creates a pensive mood allowing the viewer time to absorb and process the interrelationships of the characters and connect on a personal level.  I cried from about mid way through to the end as the characters continued to discover each other and change their perspectives.  Be sure to get this film on VHS.  The DVD is cut shorter and leaves out some really good material.,1144368000,13,766,4.521739130434782
