6398180,5,B00K12K4VW,"This is a really great soccer story.  It's about the American Samoa national soccer team, known as the worst in soccer.  It's the story of the players, who work so hard, and the coach that they hire, with a story of his own, and the efforts he makes to turn them around.  The team is trying to qualify for the World Cup, and with that just behind us, this gives a look at what goes on behind the world stage, especially in a little country.  This is an inspirational story, and those who love soccer - and even those who don't - will enjoy this movie.",1408579200,2,551,4.169811320754717

6398183,5,B00K12K4VW,"This movie, like the American Samoan soccer players it follows, is all heart. Although a documentary gently and boldly unfurls itself like a true story; one that compels, overwhelms and then ultimately instructs us. I wish I did not already see it so that I had it to look forward to. It was just beautiful.",1405987200,2,307,4.6
6398184,5,B00K12K4VW,"Just saw this movie in the theater.  If you can get over the colorful language, you will laugh and cheer along with the American Samoan soccer team as they try to make it to the world cup.  Loved it!!",1403740800,6,200,4.102564102564102

6398187,5,B00K12K4VW,Inspirational movie.  These players have so much more passion & love for their game than most high paid professional athletes.  Makes me look forward to the 2018 World Cup (& I'm not a soccer fan!),1442448000,,197,4.6
6398188,5,B00K12K4VW,"You've seen all the 5 star reviews so what are you waiting for???
The movie is well structured and flows; the characters are deep and genuine; the setting is sad, beautiful, and timeless; and the cinematography and music are perfect.  Even the soccer is real and exciting.  No more reading now go watch it!",1440806400,,306,4.648148148148148

6398191,5,B00K12K4VW,"This is the absolute best documentary ever made about football.  The great coach Thomas Rongen is shown in all his faces, love, anger, pettiness, fear, all of it coursing through this beautiful film.  I was enraptured by this film, I have watched it at least 5 times, and I see something new every time, it is raw emotion.  A true story of a mans redemption, and a teams redemption.  Nothing comes close to this in the genre.",1437004800,2,425,4.48051948051948
6398192,5,B00K12K4VW,"Enter a new sporting hero, the football coach Thomas Rogen. A football team (American Samoa) well intended, some talent but little sense of direction. The 31 zilch drubbing at the hands of Australia (it may have been a more or less result as there was speculation counting them going in had stopped and Archie Thompson had a net full to add to his name). This is about how a coach can inspire and despite the attempts of divine intervention (the Samoan consummate belief in the power of the almighty and prayer as opposed to the profane coaches kick ass and chivy philosophy)-success comes. A team forms and plays with increasing belief highlighting the undisputed skills of their fafafine and a goalkeeper who has the guts to come out of retirement one more time. It is a great story and exceptional film. For the poor sod who reviewed this om Amazon UK and was bored? Its inspiring man. Get down and do 50 press-ups and a few rounds of the paddock!",1436659200,,950,4.594117647058823
6398193,5,B00K12K4VW,"I started watching this because I really like watching sport documentaries, specially soccer ones, but this documentary actually ends up transcending the sport itself and brings out what i think the point of being a person within a team, community, and country and the world is truly about! Love for others, understanding, love and pride for country while remaining inclusive but at the same time preserving ones cultural beliefs and customs. It was a really good watch...I may just buy an America Samoa jersey next world cup.",1434585600,5,526,5.057471264367816

6398205,5,B00K12K4VW,If you are tired of the antics of today's top pros this will help you fall back in love with the game. Best football movie bar none.,1430265600,,132,3.925925925925926
6398206,5,B00K12K4VW,"A great documentary of the American Samoan National Soccer Team.  ""NEXT GOAL WINS is an inspirational story about the power of
hope in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, and an
object lesson in what it really means to be a winner in life.""",1425945600,,247,4.613636363636363
6398207,5,B00K12K4VW,"By far and away this is one of the best documentaries I've ever watched. I loved every minute of it. The story follows the American Samoa soccer team, which for 17 consecutive years was ranked dead last in the FIFA world rankings. In fact the most notable thing the team had ever achieved was a 31-0 loss to Australia in a World Cup Qualifier game (the worst lost ever suffered by any International team). It's amazing how for 17 years being the worst team in the world, they never gave up. In a world where soccer players are increasingly seen as overpaid divas, here is a group of players that are playing only for pride and passion for the sport.

This a very well produced documentary with as much passion as the players they cover. It is a great achievement for the film makers to make someone like me with no connection to American Samoa feel invested to the point I was crying tears of joy for the team at the end of the film.

Wonderful story. Great film-making. Authentic people. Heartfelt Moments. True story. ""Next Goal Wins"" has it all.",1423785600,2,1048,4.481675392670157
6398208,5,B00K12K4VW,"Pulled on my heart strings. Had me cheering, jumping for joy, and crying with the team. Great story.",1420588800,,100,4.611111111111111

6398224,5,B00K12K4VW,"Well-worth the time spent watching it. The story was moving, compelling and inspiring, for sure. As a native of American Samoa, I'm grateful for such a beautifully made work of art that is authentic in its portrayal of the Samoan culture and the values that guide the Samoan spirit: faith, community & perseverance!",1412380800,,315,4.962264150943396
6398225,5,B00K12K4VW,"Wow. So much better than I expected. The players inspired me. The American Samoan people inspired me. I love the sport. I love football. But this documentary was more about the sport. I saw it with my two children, and we loved it. I cried. It really touched me. Nicky and Jaiyah two great people, and the story of Thomas Rongen and his wife -- the loss of their daughter -- how could I not cry! Brilliant.",1411689600,2,406,4.285714285714286

8655018,5,B00K12K4VW,"A remarkable and enjoyable film that celebrates the indomitable spirit of a soccer team in American Samoa. It is a true story, and not just another sports story, it glorifies the old values of hard work and diligence, cooperation, respect for one another, discipline, loyalty, appreciation of differences, and the belief that all dreams are possible. It is too bad it has not received more publicity. You do not have to be a sports fan to enjoy it.",1462233600,,448,4.756410256410256

A few days later I received an email stating I had been getting the very last DVD and it got damaged, they were no longer able to fill my request.

Very disappointed.",1450569600,,373,4.068493150684931
8655020,4,B00K12K4VW,"Good film, both my daughter and I enjoyed it and got something from it. The film's gift is the feeling it places in ones heart of the grit it takes to overcome your limitations, and accomplish something - a gift that has kept on giving.

Note that for young kids the language is a little strong in a couple of parts.",1448064000,,316,4.180327868852459
8655021,5,B00K12K4VW,"If you love football/soccer or you just love sports bios or documentaries in general, you will love this movie. I think it is hands down the greatest soccer movie I have ever seen, was lucky enough to also attend a private screening with Thomas Rongen, he is an incredible man and very funny, this is not to be missed, the message about the love of the sport is strong here, very strong, play for the love and enjoyment of the game never lose sight of what is most important.",1447804800,,475,4.348314606741573
