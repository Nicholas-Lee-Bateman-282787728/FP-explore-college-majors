3818892,4,B001V7P2WC,"Surprisingly good, as another review said already.  I grabbed it off the shelf because I need to inject a little humor into my gore.  It looked pretty cheesy, but it's actually rather compelling, and a little bit deep and thought provoking, with main and side characters that you end up caring about.  I rented it, I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to recommend it to my friends.  Nicely done.",1253664000,2,394,4.507042253521127
3818893,4,B001V7P2WC,Engaging.  Beautifully shot.  Who would expect a hidden message in a werewolf flick?,1251763200,2,84,5.384615384615385
3818894,4,B001V7P2WC,"Let's get out of the way, that this film is a creative delight hiding beneath a limited budget.  No FX innovations here, nor much wolf action either (like Twilight, the creatures rarely turn full ""wolf"") but it will take you down an unexpected road.  Director/actor Michael Worth shows he has an idea of how not to become just another genre director.  Loaded with visual style and tongue-in-cheek dialogue the film takes it out of a rut it could have otherwise found itself in.  When a group of friends return from the war after a traumatizing fire fight involving a strange enemy, the group begins to fall apart as this new disease takes them over.  Being tracked by a couple of military ""wolf-hunters"" (Saxon and Thomerson) the group goes on a cross state chase trying to either kill or transform Jake Gabriel (Worth).  Surrounded by some pretty strong acting (it is a sci fi film though), the movie is more of a drama buried under a chase film.  No, there are no expensive car chases or even heavy gun battles, but you find the style of the film innovative if limited in its scope.

This is no winner of any oscars, but has some sexy women, (intentional) humorous moments, well directed, well shot scenes and if you want something a little different but not expecting heads rolling down the aisles, this is your film.",1249430400,10,1320,4.635193133047211

3818897,2,B001V7P2WC,I got this from the library because I love werewolf films & I was consigned to bed for several weeks..  While it is better than the Howling sequels it is still pretty bad.  The photography was poor.  The acting was worse.  The story line was interesting but I had a hard time following it.,1430438400,,289,4.296296296296297
3818898,3,B001V7P2WC,"I know having recognizable names helps bring viewers, but sometimes if you put too many old actors in key roles it can distract from your story.  The storyline in this tale was thin and you had to piece it together yourself because it never was explained.  Evidently a unit in Afghanistan was attacked by what appeared to be a group of type of werewolf.  Evidently they were bitten or somehow got the strain into them, because now that they are back they are transforming and killing.  Two very old ex-military are trying to kill them to stop the rampage.  John Saxon (I didn't realize he was still alive) and Tim Thomerson (Trancers), a general and a master sergeant, are the ones on the trail.  Martin Kove makes a brief appearance.  A humorous scene had the aged Saxon and Thomerson trying to fight in a restaurant.  To the directors credit they looked like two senior citizens trying to go to it.  There is also dissension in the werewolf ranks as the three female werewolf are looking for Michael Worth - because he is the one.  One What?  I do not know.  Humor aside, it was not that bad and I found it entertaining.  Worth a watch.  Incidently Adrienne Barbeau is also in the film, still looking lovely after all these years.  It must be that great smile.",1424995200,2,1262,4.522123893805309

3818902,1,B001V7P2WC,Interesting story line. Great soundtrack. Fun comedy quotes from the senior citizens. I am a huge werewolf movie fan. This one was pretty low budget from painted noses to actors that couldn't talk with fake teeth. It is refreshing to see there are good wolves out there.,1326240000,2,270,4.76595744680851
3818903,2,B001V7P2WC,"I love werewolf films, but this one was okay but not great. A group of American soldiers return from the war infected with lycanthropy. The group splits up hoping to get over the trauma, however, several band together and decide to embrace their animal instincts.

It was really unclear whats going on, but some of the group are searching for one of the men- Jake who they want to join them. Then there is a group of older American vets who are hunting the entire pack. They seem to be fighting and killing eachother... But I'm not entirely clear why.

I did think the werewolves who were partially transformed looked sort of cool. And I liked the ending. But I admit I need more plot and more characterization to make me think this was a good film. A little more character development, and plot would've made this film shine rather than simply fizzle.",1257638400,5,852,4.562091503267974
3818904,5,B001V7P2WC,"This movie is one of those rare gems to result from the SyFy Channel's movie making onslaught. Though the effects aren't much, and some of the acting is a bit cheesy, the movie's actually very good, overall. Unlike most werewolf movies, this one shows that a werewolf can be good or evil, depending on their own preferences and personality.",1253750400,,340,4.779661016949152
8345523,4,B001V7P2WC,"Low budget, but not as bad as a lot. Campy, I think that was on purpose. Bad Make up, bad Editing... Free on Prime... All in All I enjoyed it.",1525392000,,142,3.7666666666666666
8345524,1,B001V7P2WC,I watched the movie for an hour and still have no idea what the plot is supposed to be. I've been watching undeveloped characters running around on screen not doing a whole lot. From what I gather something went wrong while the soldiers were deployed and they all came back werewolves. Besides that I don't really know... maybe some hunters... I'm not even confident with who the main character is,1523923200,,397,4.685714285714286
8345525,5,B001V7P2WC,"I actually went against the grain on this movie.  There are a lot of not so good reviews, but I really enjoyed it.  It was a bit corny and a bit odd, but I just liked it.  It was well produced and the acting was on point.  The sfx were a bit weak but it seemed to actually add to it.  I liked the whole premise of the movie.  Two aged war horses work together as mercenaries to hunt down former soldiers who were attacked and became werewolves while on patrol in a town in Afghanistan.  Meanwhile, one of the female soldiers is hunting down one of the male soldiers for procreation purposes.  What more could you want other than a bag of popcorn and control of the remote?",1521244800,,672,4.155038759689923
8345526,4,B001V7P2WC,"A new werewolf movie for a new generation? That is probably overly hyped. It is a nice werewolf tale couched in the contemporary moment: Afghan war vets exposed to werewolves in combat.

Now two packs of wolves are converging on each other while being tracked by some old timers that seem to know too much and have seen too much.

This is a nice grizzled action movie. The action looks good but the adventure story is thin, but werewolf films are never quite Shakespearean.",1520812800,,473,4.619047619047619
8345527,4,B001V7P2WC,a good werewolf movie!,1520553600,,22,4.75
8345528,2,B001V7P2WC,"I'm rounding this down to a 2 star...  I really wanted to give 3, but just can't bring myself to do it...

In terms of production quality, this is kind of like a B+ movie...  which makes sense, based on the $500k budget...  give or take...

Camera work, audio, special effects, acting, etc...  all pretty much above par...

That said...  Cons -
1 - who thought it would be cool to have girl werewolves basically just girls with a little black makeup on their noses?  ( that really really just looked plain stupid )

2 - when you set everything up for a big fight scene for like a solid minute and a half of movie time...  and you finally have the 2 people running at each other...  I kind of want to see the fight.  Not, ""ok, cut here, and let's go to the next scene, and we'll let the audience figure it out""...

( Side note...  not every fight has to be epic to be ""epic""...  I remember in ""Zatoichi"" there is a build up of like 10 mins for an epic fight scene which ends in like 2 seconds...  and it was probably the most realistic AND epic sword fight scene I've ever seen in a movie... )

3 - and this is the bigger wolf in the room...  what is with the giant gaping holes in the plot?  was this originally like a 2.5 hour long movie that was edited down to 90 mins or something?  absolutely NOTHING is explained at all...  Why was Ford in the Middle East?  Why was he hunting down his own team?  Why was Jake such an ""important"" werewolf?  Why would you hype up some character played by Martin Kove only to show him for 30 seconds and then kill him?  Beyond that, there are literally gaps in the movie where it's just like people suddenly wake up in entirely different scenarios from where you last saw them, with no explanation...  it's mainly because of this, I'm rounding down to 2 stars...

the ending too was kind of a ""what?  o...k...  so that's the end..."" kind of deal...  with the way the movie was playing out, I kind of expected something a ""little"" different...  but I don't want to give spoilers...

Yeah, for relatively low budget, it was still a moderately amusing flick to watch...  so, I won't say ""avoid"" it...  but I certainly wouldn't set my expectations too high...",1519862400,,2192,4.276283618581907
8345529,1,B001V7P2WC,"I've seen this movie before. Do not care to see it again. Horrible movie, Terrible make up. This movie is nothing, compared to Dog Soldiers. Now, that is a really good werewolf movie.",1519084800,,183,4.575757575757576
8345530,1,B001V7P2WC,It would not play on my DVD! I had to throw it away!,1506297600,,52,3.076923076923077
8345531,1,B001V7P2WC,"I don't know why the people who have reviewed this movie give it such good reviews, because it was horrible.

The plot is several soldiers, in the middle of a battle, with an unknown enemy, all of a sudden get surrounded by what appears to be Saudi werewolves. Fast forward a bit and the surviving soldiers are now werewolves themselves, mostly bad, for no apparent reason, but the main wolf, is trying to live as a civilian, working in a pharmacy. (hilarious)

While there are some B-movie names attached to this movie, overall it made no sense. First, we never actually see any of the original Saudi werewolves. Secondly, why are they attacking in the daytime? In most, if not all werewolf movies, the creature is a human, turned into a wolf after a full moon, you know, AT NIGHT. Secondly, after some of the soldiers who are now ""werewolves"" show up back in a bar, why are they evil? They were soldiers to begin with and now they are evil werewolves. Thirdly, the makeup is horrendous. No one ever goes full werewolf, but when they do change a little bit, all you see is messed up teeth and stupid fake wolf noses. Seriously? I thought they were evil versions of Bambi more than vicious werewolves. Then the ""hero"", who was fighting the transformation, finally changes, he has a blue-ish tint with a big nose. WTF!! And he knows martial arts now. So does the main villain. Best part when they jump into each other to fight and they just headbutt each other then continue fighting. Later on, a ""wolf"" who got shot, shows off her wound, and it looks like someone drew red lipstick on her.

This has got to be one of the worst werewolf movies I have ever seen. It made no sense at all and there was nothing redeeming about it. Don't believe the other reviews, go for a different werewolf movie. Late Phases of the Moon is 100x better, albeit a slow paced werewolf movie.",1478131200,,1870,4.4941176470588236
