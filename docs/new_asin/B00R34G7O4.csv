However this shipment was DISAPPOINTING.  I know this is supposed to be a product review-- which is why I am leaving four stars and will up it to five once I get a decent replacement item--
That said-- I bought this as a gift for someone and the package came-- and there was a large plastic bag inside a padded envelope.  I opened the plastic bag (which was ripped) and was surprised that the box of discs didn't have any shrink wrap to hold the discs inside of it.  The outer padded envelope was fine-- which means they sent it to me this way. The box was in rough shape (the box that says ""Globe Trekker"" on it-- the one you're supposed to put on your shelf to hold the discs.)  It was very worn, one corner was dented in (I was able to push it back out), and when the discs fell out (because there was so much slack in the box from wear), one of the discs was clearly wrapped differently than the others.  So, basically I spent 90 bucks on something that looks like I got it at a rummage sale for $5.  If it were for myself, I might keep it-- but I cannot give this as a gift, so I am in the process of returning and asking for a replacement.  If it weren't for plastic wrap being on the individual five discs, I would've thought for sure this was a used item (and not used gently!)",1486512000,3,1307,4.08203125
