2680457,5,B000JYW5BO,"Both movies are great and full on action, drama and suspense. I highly recommend them if you like a lot of action. The delivery of the movies was very prompt. They were in my mailbox two or three days after I ordered.",1284163200,,217,4.190476190476191

2680460,5,B000JYW5BO,"Generally, these double-, triple-, or otherwise multi-film deals are cheap, bottom-of-the-barrel compilations that only feed the needs of penny-pinchers and starving airmen. However, Warner Bros' ""Romeo Must Die""/""Cradle 2 the Grave"" set is a formidable double-team that breaks the subpar standard of these collections and delivers the complete package where both of these films are concerned.

Regardless of the contents of the films themselves (you'd have to have been living under a rock not catch Andrej Bartkowiak's 2000 genre-bending Jet Li/Aaliyah vehicle and its indirect sequel co-starring DMX), both include all of the special features found on the individual releases: ""Romeo"" features 13 making-of featurettes, three music videos, trailers, and DVD-ROM features; ""Cradle"" includes five featurettes, a DMX music video, the theatrical trailer, and DVD-ROM features. Both films feature English and French language tracks and corresponding subtitles (""Cradle"" also has Spanish ones) and, yes, both are featured in 2.4:1 widescreen.

I'm a bit disappointed that the middle act of Bartkowiak's quasi-trilogy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exit-Wounds/dp/B00003CXW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exit Wounds</a>, starring Steven Seagal) wasn't included on here, but I suppose Warner Bros. figured that Jet Li sells pretty darn well on his own. It's cool to have these two films together on one disc, seeing as their similarities in style make for an excellent comparison opportunity and good companions for a movie night. If it will save you money, there's no reason not to consider this double-feature over buying the two films separate: aside from filling up excess space on your movie shelf, you won't be missing out on anything.",1243641600,12,1774,5.92578125

2680475,4,B000JYW5BO,"First off, I must commend Andrej Bartkowiak (director) and Joel Silver (producer) for giving so much work to Asians and African Americans in these two movies. They not only make up the main stars of the movies, they populate the cast and credits in numbers not seen in any other mainstream movies currently made in the U.S. For this reason alone, these movies provide an ""underground"" antidote to the White-dominated world depicted in Entertainment Weekly.

So, how about the movies? Fun,exciting, sometimes touching -- but not without some problems. IMO Romeo Must Die is the better conceived and executed film. The Romeo and Juliet template may help in laying out the plot, but the updating with Chinese/African Americans is cool and rings clear in today's urban centers -- although Korean/African American would have been even more interesting (but not Korean Jet Li at this time). Best of all, there's enough meat to the script and exchanges of subtle glances to root for the Jet Li/Aaliyah alliance. Unfortunately, they don't even kiss (or even share a Coke).

Cradle 2 the Grave is the Bartkowiak/Silver follow-up to this multicultural exploration. Not too bad, this time it's dads talking to each other. For me, C2G is a little harder to get into, even though even more Asian Americans are hired. In spite of beautiful visuals and throbbing music score, the rhythm of the movie's unfolding is too metronomic. The opening scenes -- including the credits -- are wonderfully done. The rest of the movie just does not keep the pressure up (nor build it up).

As for this packaging (dual sided disc), it's great. Good price, full features and (as far as I could see) no problems in reading the disc. I always appreciate RMD more each time I see it, hopefully, C2G will fare just as well in the future.",1390262400,,1803,4.847402597402597
2680476,4,B000JYW5BO,"""Romeo Must Die"" was fun when it was still in the theatre, and I just hadn't seen ""Cradle 2 The Grave.""  Personally, the first was more fun, but it was a pleasant surprise at how entertaining the latter movie is. I'd watch it again (and often do watch movies again when I just can't find one that's fun via our rental options).  And for $4/movie, it seems like a good deal to me.",1372291200,,379,4.178082191780822
