7027216,5,B00U1GQMO6,A truly inspirational movie that brings God to the forefront unlike so many movies in today's culture.,1434067200,3,102,5.0588235294117645
7027217,5,B00U1GQMO6,"If you're looking for an inspiring family film with an uplifting story, look no further. The List is a touching story about overcoming life's struggles and finding strength in faith.",1434067200,14,182,5.1
7027218,5,B00U1GQMO6,"The most thought provoking film I've seen in a long time.  The writer of the story describes the theme of this film as ""God's sovereignty over our lives as opposed to our list of achievements"" but it's so much more.  At some point in our lives, we all feel like orphans.  This film does a great job showing how God adopts us into His family as His own and loves us the way we desire to be loved.  Great job, Scott Pryor!  The script is done very well.",1433116800,23,451,4.079545454545454

7027221,5,B00U1GQMO6,This is a wonderful movie that shows how your priorities are changed dramatically when you turn your back on your family and friends.,1485734400,,133,4.826086956521739

7027224,1,B00U1GQMO6,"Terrible...Just like most all of Bridgestone's movies. Choppy scenes, audio was off, poor acting, and rediculous storyline! I'll stick with Pureflix movies from now on.",1484438400,,168,5.76
7027225,1,B00U1GQMO6,"Probably the worst 5 bucks I've spent in a long time. I watched the trailer and thought the story line looked interesting so I decided (based on the rating) that I would give it a whirl. I have to say the only reason I watched the whole movie was that I had paid good money for it. The script is ridiculous and disjointed. The only thing worse than the script was the amateurish acting and directing. I hate to say it but the acting was subpar to some porn I've been subjected to. The script is so weak that some scenes have the actors just repeating lines, I guess to fill in time. Don't waste your money.",1483660800,,606,4.188034188034188

7027232,2,B00U1GQMO6,"I wanted to enjoy this but the acting was awkward, there was zero-chemistry between the main character and his wife and the brother's cameo later in the movie was just weird, as was most of the dialogue. A ""one"" on the realistic scale. Many better choices out there if you're looking for a good Christian movie.",1470614400,,311,4.571428571428571
7027233,5,B00U1GQMO6,Awesome Movie.... ethically and morally!!!,1469836800,,42,7.6

7027241,5,B00U1GQMO6,"Arrived in record time, excellent packaging as DVD was in perfect condition. Very good movie!  It was convincing, very well done, and presented hard truth in a very serious but touching way. I highly recommend it. The thing I especially liked about it is that the character stayed in character. Meaning, he didn't suddenly become a ""different person"" from who he was as a person; he didn't become someone else. He was saved, meaning he asked the Lord to come into his heart and take over his life, to live for the Lord rather than for just himself... But he was just a better version of the same man, not a whole new person whom you don't even recognize. Too often in movies, when one becomes a Christian, from that point on you barely recognize the person for whom they are. This was realistic and true to life.",1461196800,3,812,4.486486486486487

7027245,5,B00U1GQMO6,"We have children ranging from 4-16. My teenagers loved this movie, my grade schoolers loved it as well!!! This has a great message behind it and it really makes you look around at your life and re evaluate your priorities. It's a real life look not a Disney happy endings look and I love that it all felt real and not acted!",1454976000,4,324,4.241935483870968

7027247,2,B00U1GQMO6,"Disappointing.  No clear character development, obvious plot at places and jumped around at others.  Christian characters not likable.  Couldn't stand the way the movie was moving along.  Didn't even finished it.",1452902400,,212,5.741935483870968
7027248,5,B00U1GQMO6,"This is one of the best, most brilliant, most riveting movies I have ever seen!  It is gripping and packed with content.  It covers so many life themes and does so realistically and richly.  I have watched it 3 times and have been very impacted each time.  My friends agree it is extraordinary and moving. I highly recommend seeing it!!!",1449100800,6,337,4.566666666666666

7027254,4,B00U1GQMO6,"This premise of a story is much needed, especially today.  Too much value is placed on material things.  Scott Pryor and the rest of the cast did an admiral job, although they could work on their acting.  Visually however, this wonderful Christian film stands tall with any hollywood production.",1438732800,,295,4.979591836734694
7027255,5,B00U1GQMO6,It is a good movie.  Deal with a lot of hard trials in life.  I did not keep a dry eye.  Not the best acting but a great meaning in a movie.  God's story always rises above everything.,1437177600,,184,3.763157894736842
7027256,5,B00U1GQMO6,"This is a must-see film!  I thoroughly enjoyed the strong story-line that clearly presents the gospel message while at the same time guiding viewers to consider their own lives and if they have placed God first as they cross off their ""list"" of things to accomplish in life.  My children and husband truly enjoyed the movie and have watched it several times already!",1434931200,11,366,4.7936507936507935
7027257,5,B00U1GQMO6,"My family and I loved this movie. The message was great. It has some hard moments of sadness, but God's love comes through.  The acting was spot on. It didn't have any awkward moments that Christian films often have. Definitely worth it to own! I will be sharing with friends and family that need to hear the message of hope.",1434672000,11,325,4.416666666666667
7027258,5,B00U1GQMO6,"I will admit that I'm a little biased because this movie was written by the star of the movie who is the husband of my friend, Laura (who also stars in the movie with their children). That being said, I can honestly say that I was pleased by the clear presentation of the Gospel message in this movie. I was moved by the representation of God's grace, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and how He can reach into anyone's life no matter who they are or what their background and totally transform and redeem. I feel that as Christians we do often forget that we are in this world but not of this world and can easily lose sight of what is really important in life. This was a very thought-provoking movie and it made me concentrate once again on the importance of remembering that it's a man's soul, where he or she will spend eternity and whether or not they are in a right relationship with God, that really matters. Everything else in life we will leave behind one day but souls live on forever. I was pleased that the sound track in no way detracted from the message as well. I highly recommend this movie.",1434499200,27,1106,4.3478260869565215

8703836,5,B00U1GQMO6,"Christian-themed movies are tackling important issues in our real lives and are now doing it at a very high level. In the past such movies were just awful and heavy-handed.  Thank you, filmmakers, for a great story well-done.  The List is about how sometimes  all of our carefully-made plans can fall apart. It's almost as if some power beyond us has other plans for us that, as it turns out, are much  better than the ones of our own making.  Thank God!",1506038400,,454,4.487804878048781
8703837,1,B00U1GQMO6,"Uhm. So, unless you love vacillating between incredulity (due to the inane nature of the dialogue, acting, and overall production of this movie) and the pain of being reminded that terrible things happen for no reason, combined with the totally ridiculous nature of religious intersections with reality....dont watch this until there is literally nothing else left to watch. Which is what i did. But, I still couldn't finish it. oh god it could have been good. But it wasnt.",1501113600,,474,5.012658227848101
8703838,5,B00U1GQMO6,Enjoyed this movie about a man and his list who finds out God's list for him is different. I always try to support Christian movies so more will be made.,1499040000,,153,4.133333333333334
8703839,5,B00U1GQMO6,"I was not expecting this movie to be nearly as good as it was.  I watched it on a whim and I am so glad I did.  The characters were so real and genuine to me.  The acting, wow, I mean I hadn't heard of anyone in the film except Montell Jordan and to be honest, everyone in the movie out acted him by leaps and bounds (to be fair, he didn't have very many scenes)!  I loved that this movie wasn't over the top with the negative stuff.  Although there was heartbreak and tragedy (even some violence) this movie did not show gory, unnecessary scenes and details that would have made it hard for some viewers to watch. THANK YOU!  Like a well written book, there was just enough shown and explained that one could understand what happened with dragging out the movie or slowing down the plot. Real life challenges were tackled in a realistic way that made me relate to and feel for each character.  To be honest, I would love to see a sequel.  There are a number of stories that could continue from this movie.  This movie is entertaining, enjoyable enough for me to encourage my dad to watch it but it is also clean enough (with worthwhile lessons) for me to recommend it to teens and young adults.",1497139200,,1195,4.299107142857143
8703840,4,B00U1GQMO6,"This is a very good Christian movie.  Well acted, produced, etc... Plot is good but not surprising.
Over-all it is a multiple-watcher and has been enjoyed.",1494979200,,155,4.961538461538462
8703841,5,B00U1GQMO6,This movie as a very nice family movie well done with humor and some religious tone to it. I would buy it again as a gift to a friend.,1494201600,,134,3.6551724137931036

8703843,5,B00U1GQMO6,Great Item. Highly recommend. AAA+++,1489708800,,36,6.4
8703844,5,B00U1GQMO6,"Not sure why this isn't rated at least 4.5 stars, if not 5. I've seen a lot of Christian movies, and in my opinion this is the best I've ever seen, beating out every one of the Kendrick movies (Facing the Giants, Fireproof, Courageous, War Room). It feels much less formulaic, and much more gritty and ""real"". Yes, despite being a bit more fantastic, it STILL felt more real to me.

Some of the reviews said that the acting was awkward. The only place I ever felt that maybe it was was with the main character, but even there, I think it came off as the character's personality and social awkwardness, which made it more realistic to me, not less, since I am socially awkward myself.

Some of the reviews said that they didn't like the script, which confuses me because I think this is one of the places the movie shines. I thought the script was very witty and for the most part flowed well.

Perhaps if you are unaffected by the themes in the movieand there are several: ambition, family, grace, forgiveness, evangelism, brokenness, backsliding, and anger, to name a fewthen it would lose depth, and at that point I might see how someone wouldn't like it. Otherwise I highly recommend it if you have any interest in Christian values at all.",1488412800,,1242,4.535714285714286
