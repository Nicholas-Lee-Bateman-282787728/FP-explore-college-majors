8294256,5,B001DN0UTE,"I started reading this series first.  I think when I started watching it as the anime I was expecting it to be one of those series adapted for children.  You know what I'm talking about?  When all the voice actors/actresses kind of suck and you just can't get past the first DVD because its too naive.  This series isn't like that.  Its literally about a girl who has status but not wealth.  She's brought to the king's palace (and promised a lot of money) if she can get him to man up and become a less lazy person.  What she quickly realizes, however, is that he's not nearly as arrogant or stupid as she initially thought.  In fact, he's sharp as a tack, even sharper than her in some respects, and I would praise this anime in the area for making an intelligent and witty female lead, so that's saying something.  Much to her advantage, however, he's a kind person and completely taken with her, so hilarity and fun ensues.

I will say though.  While I'm surprisingly very taken with how good this anime is, the price gauging is just out of control.  I HIGHLY suggest to either buy it used if you can, or just watch it on netflix.",1390867200,,1134,4.347619047619047
8294257,5,B001DN0UTE,"I liked this first volume so much that I bought the complete first season. I also watched the second season online. It was in Japanese; so, I had to read the subtitles. I was a little dismayed by the ending; so, I bought the paperback volume 8 and 9. Volume 9 has not been converted into English. Volume 8 was covered in the first season. By the end of the second season there was a case still not brought to an ending and the princess still had not chosen a love interest. There was no subtitles indicating what the Emperor whispered to Shurei. Also, Shurei had not accepted the Emperor's proposal. I don't know how this story will end, but for me it would be nice if the heroine, Shurei, marries the Emperor. I read some blogs about ""The Story of Saiunkoku"": most of the females wanted Shurei to marry the Emperor, but there were a few males that thought she should die, since there were so many males that were enamored by her. The only thing I know is that if this story does not have a happy ending, I will never view it again.",1364169600,,1032,4.270408163265306
8294258,4,B001DN0UTE,"So if you purchased Saiunkoku, You'll love it. It's like pride and prejudice meets China culture meets cool sword fights. But Don't buy this version. It won't play in some computers. And the Box set is way cheeper plus you'll get more episodes with the box set. The cover art is cute and the show is nice. But only 4 episodes per disc. In my personal opinion 30.00 for this DVD is too much.",1270252800,,390,4.283783783783784
8294259,5,B001DN0UTE,Received it before estimated time in a very good condition. Only plays in Sony DVD Player.,1255305600,,90,4.6875
8294260,5,B001DN0UTE,"They say ""don't judge a book by it's cover.""  Or in this case, a DVD.  To anyone who has watched a lot of shojo (girls') anime, the first thought that comes to mind is ""Hm, this looks a lot like Fushigi Yuugi, so it must be similar.""  In fact, that was part of the reason why I picked it up.  I thought I would give it a chance since I gave Fushigi Yuugi a chance once.  Well, if you think this is just a Fushigi Yuugi clone, you'd be wrong.  Beyond the setting of a fictional Ancient China-like world, that's where the similarities end.

Saiunkoku focuses on Shuurei, a young woman from a well-to-do family who has fallen on hard times.  She has a passion for learning and hard work (and of course getting money from said work--she hates wasteful spending).  As luck (or scheming people) would have it, she is given a position at the imperial palace, and from there she meets a very interesting cast of characters, including the emperor who doesn't really want to rule.  She strives to better herself, the emperor, and the rest of Saiunkoku, hoping for a brighter future for everyone.

The series is moderate on family plots and political matters (this is based off of Ancient China after all), but it doesn't lose sight of the real joy of the show--the characters.  There are a lot of them to take in from just the first four or five episodes, but 98% of them stay for the entire series, so get used to them, love them, cheer when they make an appearance, throw popcorn and boo at the screen when they make an appearance, etc.  Anyone who likes shojo anime will appreciate the rare COMPETENT female main character who doesn't fall for every hot guy that she sees (which would be a problem in this show--just look at the opening animation).  The love story vein is natural, cute, and almost pathetic at times, and it doesn't seem forced just for the sake of two people getting together in the end.  Also, there is a wonderful lack of the traditional shojo fare of bubbles and sparkles.  But I guess the flowers make up for it...

So don't let the copious amount of flowers fool you.  The Story of Saiunkoku is a wonderful addition to any shojo anime lover's collection.  And once you get done with the 39 episode series, don't feel sad--there's a second season that will hopefully be coming out soon.",1233360000,11,2301,4.474820143884892
