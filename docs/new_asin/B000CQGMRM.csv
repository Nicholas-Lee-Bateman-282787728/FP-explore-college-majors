8100406,4,B000CQGMRM,I found this movie used at a local flea market. It is B rated indy film but it isn't horrible. You just got to get that it was filmed on no budget in a one bedroom apartment.  It has a few cute real (or I should say appear to be in the goth scene in the LA area) girls that are in it and a poorly impersonated German fetish mag photographer.  I liked it but I like cheesy,1415404800,,371,3.7435897435897436
8100407,1,B000CQGMRM,"I wasted money on this based on the wonderful Amazon Recommendations.  I think this is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen.  It was poorly shot, even for a low budget film, and was very boring.  The acting was bad, almost but not quite humorously so.  Don't waste your money on this one.",1195344000,7,292,4.351851851851852
8100408,5,B000CQGMRM,"This was a low budget movie but the director certainly was not cheap about the laughs.  The movie is funny, especially Bad Kitty.  Check her out!",1138233600,2,145,4.538461538461538
8100409,4,B000CQGMRM,this movie isn't like something you'll find at blockbuster. very low budget but funny as hell.,1134950400,4,94,4.9375
