5564419,5,B00B999F48,"Craig was at his best. I've seen the Lovemaster perform live at least 4 times and this was his best ever. Yes, the Lovemaster appears but, you won't be disappointed in Craig's mastery of the stage as he gives you an ample amount of new material.",1366070400,,245,4.3478260869565215

5564428,5,B00B999F48,"I'll start by saying I think Craig Shoemaker is terrific, he is super funny,a great singer actually,capable of incredible impressions and my favorite thing about him is his knack for nostalgia and contrasting the childhoods of the baby boomers with the current generations. I should also add I was at this show when it was filmed here in Southern California ,nearly two years ago.

The reason I titled my review as I did , is simply that in the three stand up DVDs Craig has out... he repeats his best bits , often. In fact about 75% is the same disc to disc and show to show , with slight variations. Unlike Carlin, Miller, Reagan, Titus and others who work for a couple of years polishing new material and then FILM THAT SHOW, Craig is always filming a version of his only show.... BUT IT IS A REALLY FUNNY ACT!

I guess what I'm saying is, if you don't have one of his DVDs... starting here is as good as anywhere. If you already own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Craig-Shoemaker-The-Lovemaster-Unzipped/dp/B000Y2WAPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Craig Shoemaker: The Lovemaster... Unzipped</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Craig-Shoemaker-Live-That-s-A-True-Story/dp/B0006HBLMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Craig Shoemaker: Live - That's A True Story!</a>&nbsp;don't expect a new show, just a slightly different show , but still the unique Shoemaker show that only Craig offers.

Of course saying what I have, some folks get disappointed when they go to see their favorite singer or stand up and they get an all new set of stories and jokes and they may have just been looking to re hear all their favorites from an old friend. My gal and I actually get to see Craig semi regularly and we usually still get a kick out of the ""old favorites"" as they are.

I mostly wanted to make it clear that while the title implies that this is a new show, its just another version of THE show, but it is still a five star show at a lot higher price than what this DVD goes for!",1374278400,3,2062,5.220543806646526
5564429,4,B00B999F48,"I think Craig Shoemaker is a severely underrated comedian... If you haven't seen or heard his Love Master bit then you are truly missing out!! And his impersonations of the characters of Mayberry are spot on and hilarious!! Give yourself the gift of laughter and buy this DVD... And if opportunity knocks, do yourself a favor and see him live!",1371081600,,343,4.733333333333333
5564430,4,B00B999F48,"I have seen Craig live at least 3 times in the past few years.  He is a really funny guy.  This DVD has most of his usual act plus a few new ones.  The ""Pez"" joke is a crack-up!  If you have never seen him this DVD is a good way to check him out.

I would love to see Craig put out a completely new act on DVD for us longer-time fans!

Overall this is a good one to add to your stand-up collection.",1369008000,,398,3.623529411764706
