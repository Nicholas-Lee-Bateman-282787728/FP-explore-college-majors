Unfortunately many of the films are her post plastic surgery film where she looks terrible. I am saddened to see that she destroyed her perfect lips, and she now looks hideous because of that. But she is still excellent in all these films even though it is tough and heartbreaking to watch her in them. I wonder how much better they would have been if she kept her natural beauty. Even at 50 she is stilll otherwise an amazingly beautiful and talented woman. I just wish things could have turned out different for her.",1402704000,2,632,4.319327731092437
8191407,4,B000PHW2P4,"I got the collection. I admit curiosity about Emmanuelle is what drove me to buy the set. ""A Heart in Winter"" AKA ""Un Coeur En Hiver"" - A weird mnage--trois involving Camille (Emmanuelle Bart), the violinist, Stphane (Daniel Auteuil), a repairer of violins, and Maxime (Andr Dussollier), her lover. Stphane is a social voyeur. A weird love triangle ensues. Watching it was divine and surprising in its outcome.

The second movie, ""The Story of Marie and Julien"" AKA ""Histoire de Marie et Julien"" is all the title implies. It is a biographical filmed story of how Marie (Emmanuelle Bart) and Julien (Jerzy Radziwilowicz) meet and how their interaction within a desperate family group develops over time as they all try to evade the feared Nazi and their eventual re-introduction into French society. I believe it to be a well developed story line with incidents that occurred then that could still occur in any part of our world.

The third and last movie of this set, ""Nathalie"". Talk about a Private Investigator story with a twist. Catherine (Fanny Ardant) believes that Bernard (Grard Depardieu) has been unfaithful to her and hires Marlene (Emmanuelle Bart) to pose as Nathalie and ingratiate herself into Bernard's life and report back to her what she learns. The results will surprise and astound the most practiced afficionado of P.I. films.

The three films together earn four of five stars from me and induced me to obtain a couple more films by Emmanuelle Bart.",1234051200,14,1471,4.947368421052632
