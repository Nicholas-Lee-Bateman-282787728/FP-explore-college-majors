7895753,5,6305809062,"If you compare the first tape of all three seasons, it's obvious that Try's Tape 1 is the one with the most progression in plot. With a new almost central character, Filia ul Copt the Golden Dragon Priestess, and  Valgarv (Valgaav, whatever), the enigmatic ""Mazoku"" (yes, I AM  hinting at a big spoiler) whom you just KNOW has more to him, but you can't  pinpoint what... the first two episodes are hilarious; and are great for a  laugh, and the last episode has a really rather cool fight scene with  Valgarv. (Two, actually. Make sure to cheer when Gourry roundhouses Val in  the face!) I'm honestly impressed with the dubbing for Filia and Valgarv; I  was expecting the worst after hearing some sound clips. To sum it up, I'm  expecting Slayers Try to be the best season of all, if the first tape is  anything to judge by. And Filia and Xellos are absolutely hilarious  together... *grin*",960681600,,891,4.617834394904459
7895754,5,6305809062,"Slayers. One of the best around animes there is. And the Try series (as far as i can tell) is the awsomeist one out there!  The first volume (which has four lovely episodes! ) starts off with Lina, Gourry (jellyfish  brains) and Zelgadis in Seryuurn preparing to go to the outer world. Lina  is hired by some blonde mace wielding woman (who brains Gourry with it for  looking up her skirt! ) to do something, but the blonde (whose name is  Filia) only says that she needs to test their power. Through a couple of  twists and turns, Lina and her pals meet up with Amelia and are attacked by  a golden Dragon (Filia turns into it, kinda like Milgasia in the Next  series) at a sea port. Oh what to do, what do to? Obviously, Lina fires up  her mighty dragon slave, and blast the critter, which dissapears.  Unfortunately, Lina-chan's dragon slave caused a huge tidal wave and they  destroy the port. Now what are the Slayers gonna do? Go to the outter  world, what else? Too bad though, because the ship they're on has no food.  (And with Lina and Gourry, that type of situation can become very  dangerous, very fast) And this is just the first episode!  Later on, we  meet up with Filia, Lina recieves a letter from her fearsome sister Luna  Inverse, the powerful Knight of Ceipheed, and XELLOS-SAMA! Yes, our  favorite little Purple haired Mazoku is back! With a vengence! The question  is, what exactly he up to now? The fights between Xellos and Filia are  hilarous! The only downside I can see to the dub is that Filia has this  name for Xellos, Namagomi (translation, raw Garbage) that really pisses Xel  off. But they didn't use it in the Dub, she only called him a creep. The  battle between Valgaarve (Another extremely hot Mazoku, my sister says he  dresses like aladdin though) and Xellos is sooo cool! Almost Dragon Ball Z  like in the fighting (only not as drawn out, and they don't take forever to  power up). THIS IS A GOOD TAPE! AND AN EVEN BETTER SERIES! The humor, the  fighting, the spells, it's all BACK! Get this!  It's better then the next  series! (and believe me, that's hard to top)",958435200,10,2105,4.480211081794195
7895755,5,6305809062,Slayers TRY is the BEST Slayers Series that was Ever Made! Back with all of the original cast and new characters as well! Slayers TRY I believe is the end of the TV series.,955497600,3,172,4.088235294117647
7895756,5,6305809062,"After watching all of the Slayers Series: Original, Next, and Try, I believe the last series is the funniest one.  I've seen the subtitled version of Slayers Try and I can't wait to see the Dubbed version.  I still  prefer the subbed version of this series because the voice acting is so  great and funny.  I already purchased the first two slayers series and I  can't wait to get my hands on slayers try.  I'm also gonna wait to  repurchase all the series when they do come out in the DVD format, and it  will, so then I could have both dubbed and subbed.",955065600,3,556,4.269230769230769
7895757,4,6305809062,"Slayers has always been my favorite anime, and TRY only add to this. Why?
1) Xelloss returns. Dragons beware.
2) The animation is top notch, much improved since first season.
3)The plot of TRY deviates from Slayers and NEXT a bit, with lots of new characters and not as much focus on Lina alone. Mini plots are tied together wonderfully for the storyline, and while it can get serious, the good 'o laughs and zany stuff is still around.",953164800,2,436,4.531645569620253
