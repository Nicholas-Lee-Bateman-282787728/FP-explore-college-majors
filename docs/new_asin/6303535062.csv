7850398,2,6303535062,"In the first of two sequels to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Swordsman/dp/0782000568/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Swordsman</a>, Lorenzo Lamas does all he can to not participate in an unengaging plot while a bunch of swordfights take place. This makes for a tolerable B-movie that nevertheless has almost no re-watch value and thereby misses out of a higher rating. There are enough good things about the film to make a TV viewing worthwhile, but few people ought to actually spend money on this.

The story: A policeman with psychic powers (Lamas) investigates the theft of an ancient Macedonian sword, leading him to a lethal underground fighting circuit and supernatural plot against him.

Admittedly, I did not know this was a sequel when I began watching it, and this may have unfairly swayed my opinion...although probably not too much, because the film's problems remain. The foremost of these is its lead star, who has the unexplained ability to see the past of any object he touches but otherwise is entirely without personality. Lorenzo investigates the aftermath of the underground fightfests but does not properly enter the film or do anything of consequence until the final third, wherein he participates in a couple of swordfights. His immediate costars George Touliatos (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Means-War/dp/B005LAIGXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Means War</a>) and James Hong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marco-Polo/dp/B001190SGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marco Polo</a>) play much bigger parts in carrying the film, although Hong is by far the superior actor to anyone else in the picture.

The action content is almost entirely related to swordfighting, and the ten full-length fights range from decent to forgettable. I consider the action better than that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Samurai/dp/B000AYEL3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Samurai</a>&nbsp;but worse than that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-of-Steel/dp/B00004TITL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring of Steel</a>, two other weapon-based fight flicks. Most of the matches are a showcase for Christopher Clements, who is talented enough to have returned to the trilogy in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/G2-Mortal-Conquest/dp/B00001ODH7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">G2: Mortal Conquest</a>&nbsp;but who is at the mercy of ho-hum choreography and troublesome pacing. Lamas throws some nice kicks but his all-important finale is a particularly clumsy and poorly-edited bout without a satisfying conclusion.

Endless flashbacks to a dream of Lamas' character become wearying very fast, and the story as a whole fails to engage (though the individual characters occasionally show some charm). Lorenzo is capable of much better as a karate star, so resort to this film only if you're running low on his other material.",1428796800,3,3097,6.892857142857143

7850402,3,6303535062,"I actually enjoyed this sequal more than the first Swordsman.  It is a similar plot, but it's a little more interesting and has some extra small twists and turns along the way.  The majority of the same cast reappears, and a new addition - James Hong (Bloodsport 2, Talons of The Eagle, Perfect Weapon).  The biggest difference was that the amounts of fights and fighters had considerably increased.  There was also more variety in the fights and fighters, with matches similar to that in American Samurai.

The sword is once again stolen from the museum, but we know immediately it is the museum's owner who has put the operation together.  He wants the sword to give to his fighter to make him lots of money on some fights, then retire.  In addition, his insurance will pay handsomely if the sword is not found by the cops - Andrew (Lamas) and his girlfriend partner and male partner from the previous film.  Oh yeah, and suddenly his male partner has come back to life from the previous film, as the previous reviewer mentioned.

James Hong enters the scene as a reincarnation of the man that Alexander defeated so long ago, and he's back for his revenge.  With his Persian fighter ""Mongol"" (an exceptionally large man) he hopes to defeat the true owner of the sword, who is the reincarnation of Alexander the Great.  Andrew is lured into the tournament, after the museum's owner has lost his fighter, and forced to fight against Mongol.

Not the best of fight action, but moderately enjoyable, and so much more than the first film.  If you like plenty of swordplay fighting you should like this film.",1188604800,3,1604,4.685714285714286
7850403,2,6303535062,"The first ""Swordsman"" movie with Lorenzo Lamas took itself seriously, playing like a poor man's ""Highlander."" This go-round, It decends into camp, and not always for the better.
The story is a  re-working of the original: the ""sword of Alexander the Great""  gets stolen and our hero cop, who has dreams of a toga-clad swordfight and  can see the last seconds of a dead person's life through his eyes by  touching his blood, must infiltrate an underground gladiadorial combat  ring. This time the beautiful museum researcher starts out as his  girlfriend, and somehow his parter, who had been left floating in a  swimming pool (a la ""Sunset Boulevard"") in the previous movie, is  alive as if nothing happened.
Several sequences from the first movie are  inserted in this one, making a back-to-back viewing guite humorous (a la  MST3K: ""How do you make sure an original movie is on time and under  budget? Don't make one!""). They handled the fencing ring completely  differently though. Whereas in the first movie, the fighters were uniform  in wearing black tank-tops and pants with matching weapons, this movie had  each fighter as a costumed character fighing with a distinctive style. The  attitude of the tournament was much more WWF/WCW and less of the formal,  serious mood. The bettors, instead of being subdued, formal rich people,  were loud, trashy, yuppie club-goer types, serviced by a guy with a leather  jacket, visor, and chalkboard. The fighting had a lot more hand-to-hand  action and a great variety of weapons (axes, katanas, elk-horn knives, a  fan, etc).
Like the first movie, there are confusing plot elements and  several big holes. There is also one real big boner. One character believes  that he is the re-incarnation of someone executed by Alexander aroubnd the  300's BC, yet James Hong (the actor playing the role, as well as he ever  does) keeps on saying he will have his revenge at last, after ""1700  years!"" Math practice, anyone?
Both of these movies are best for  people who can't get enough sword fighting. There's really nothing else it  can do for you. A similarly themed movie (without the  psychic/re-incernation element) that I can reccommend is ""Ring of  Steel,"" with Robert Chapin, Carol Alt, and Joe Don Baker.",962582400,6,2253,4.96514745308311
