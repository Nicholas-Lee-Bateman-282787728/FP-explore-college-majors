1052989,5,6305627401,"South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut was the smartest, funniest movie of the summer of 1999.  It was by far the most political film I've seen in years.  Oliver Stone has nothing on Matt and Trey. If you haven't seen this  film you don't know what you're missing.  Much funnier than American Pie,  this movie will also make you think.  It is the best satire to come out in  years.  Most people missed the political statement the movie was making  because of the ""harsh language,"" but the language was the  statement.  I can't wait for this DVD to come out.",938044800,,554,4.44

1052991,5,6305627401,"Sure it's a little raunchy, crude and a little sick, but I'm sure you will die laughing.  The gags and inside jokes are just a taste of what you will get from this movie.  I'm 22 years old and some of the stuff in this movie  really shocked me. Matt and Trey are just pure creative wonders.  I mean  how do they come up with this stuff?  If you thought ""Something about  Mary"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" were a little sick, just wait  until you pop this movie into your DVD or VHS.  Prepare to be  dramatized!!!!!!  I do not recommend this movie for anyone under the age of  18,  although the majority that will watch this movie will be under this  age.  Anyways, enjoy the movie and I'll just hope that Matt and Trey  produce another fantastic movie like this in the near future!!!!",937872000,,778,4.2620689655172415

The music in this is fantastic and memorable. I find myself humming the tunes it of nowhere, they're ingeniously catchy. The story is as ridiculous as you could expect from South Park. Any fan of the show would enjoy this movie.

My comment to newbies to the series, this is one of the peaks of South Park's timeline. They dip in quality here and there based on personal preference, but this is a resounding positive installment in the franchise among long-time fans.",1485820800,2,636,4.578947368421052

It also doesn't hurt that there are a number of hilarious songs. A lot of the humor had me scratching my head, or was mildly shocking for its audacity. However, none of it was less than interesting.

The movie isn't unfunny it is just that since 1999 our world and culture has become so horrifying and crass that any shock value this flick once may have had is severely diminished.

1054003,5,6305627401,"South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut is one of the best social satires ever created. Sure, that's a very bold statement to be said about an 100+ year old industry, but it's true. For those who don't understand why South Park is brilliant, let me explain: South Park takes current events, media, and everyday situations and adds layers on to it to make it over the top. That way, people that like simple slapstick, swear words, and farts will get the content they want, while those with a hunger for deeper comedy about the issues of today will also get their fill. Bigger, Longer, & Uncut takes the overprotective mothers that use films as escape-coats for children being children. It then brilliantly takes that and turns it into comedic gold by having it be as over the top as you'd expect from Stone and Parker. South Park's humor isn't for everyone, but for those looking for a deeper meaning in their humor, South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut is a film I would fully recommend.",1435968000,2,982,4.617142857142857

The kids have to try to be the voice of reason, especially Kenney, who, having died twice in one day, has to prevent Satan (and his abusive lover, Saddam Husein) from invading Earth during the final battle.

1054241,4,6305627401,"If you watch South Park on TV and haven't seen this movie yet, then you should probably ask if you even are a South Park fan. This movie is an entire chaotic mess of what a chaotic movie could even be in this chaotic world of entertainment (what a mouthful.) More raw than the TV show, the naughty movie shows no fear in crossing boundaries with the boys, parents, Canadians America everybody and everything. It's one cinematic piece of mayhem the MPAA probably wouldn't have wanted you to see if it were run solely by our parents!

I personally enjoyed the classic South Park humour gone one level up. I believe this could never have been packed into a thirty minute episode at all, so it's worth watching for all it's worth. Not to mention, this wouldn't be approved to air, the way it is, on TV not for more than 30 minutes, at least. Any attempt to think that this movie is just one big regular South Park episode will result in simply proving them wrong. It just becomes increasingly ridiculous by that, I mean much better!

So if you call yourself a South Park fan and you haven't seen this movie yet, do it you won't. Watch it! Just if your kids claim they're South Park fans, this one movie might er, isn't right for them. Wait 'till they're the right age for this one.

Pros:
-The movie is still as funny as it ever was

-the blu-ray allows you to appreciate the multi-textured renders of the animation

Cons:

- Blu-Ray menu is sluggish. The menu doesn't react as fast as it should and it makes selecting scenes a bit more annoying than it ought to be

- Disappointing amount of features. Bonus features include commentary, theatrical trailers, and a Brian Boitano music video. Not bad, but I wasn't too interested in it

The final straw for the angry mothers of South Park is when Cartman made a $100 bet to Kenny to make a fart fire, but Kenny lit himself on fire by his own fart, is killed, and sent to heck. The mothers of South Park ask the government to declare war on Canada, put a V-Chip on their children, and execute the war prisoners Terrence and Phillip. Satan made a sign that he will rise above Earth when Terrence and Phillip are killed and rules Earth.

1054659,3,6305627401,"""Without ever being a fan or a viewer at all of South Park, the 1999 film adaptation is a rather respectable yet at times annoying one. The South Park movie thankfully complements some of its downfalls which is noticeable in its musical numbers and short length (at 77 minutes) for its scathing satire and commentary on the power of profanity.

Profanity, in of itself, is an action motivated by many emotions and can be inducted as free speech but the film examines how it takes four kids to be willing to idolise two foul-mouthed Canadians and sneak into an R-rated film and cause havoc in their little town. The controversial nature behind its narrative is the subject of many documentaries on censorship and after initial interest from This Film is Not Yet Rated, the film seemed much more like something I would give a try. The debate lingers on but, in all honesty, depends on how you conduct things in the matter of parenting and thought control as if you reprimand or wholly allow swearing.

While the film's explicit dialogue and content is not suitable for the impressionable, if you do allow your teenagers to watch South Park (or Family Guy, for that matter), it is important that you teaching them children to be careful of acting, behaving, or using certain words in public is a matter of discipline, respect, and dignity. Teach them early when they're young and learning before havoc breaks in.""",1366156800,,1410,4.774590163934426

Nevertheless, the film is rated R and this was made back in the late 90's so the creators had free reign to do pretty much anything.
The songs are by far the best parts of this movie. The musical numbers not only move the story along, but effectively showcase the personalities of the characters as well.
South Park's unique style of animation is not for everyone, since it is about as crude-looking  as the content itself is crude. I personally love the construction-paper-cutout look of South Park, but some may disagree.
I give this film 4 out of 5 stars because to me it would've been perfect had the writers focused more on the comedy and a little less on satire. South Park's brilliant comedic elements were present the first half of the movie, the second half I found to be rather boring and preachy. After Kenny's death, the movie seemed to go downhill from there.

1054798,4,6305627401,"My movie for last night was ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut."" I used to watch South Park episodes on TV. My wife is much younger and she enjoyed them. They were okay, and somewhat amusing and irreverent. I would have preferred to watch other things, but watching South Park was acceptable. So, the other day I saw the South Park movie on the DVD bargain rack at Wal-Mart and I bought it out of curiosity. Wow, 639 reviews. What could I possibly add? Mostly five-star reviews, too.

Well, I enjoyed the movie. It was irreverent, as expected, and most of the comedy was centered about language. I was laughing, especially in the early part of the movie. There's just something naturally funny about real young kids or their comic depictions using really course gutter language. I guess it's because it's so unexpected. The kids are so young they couldn't possibly know what they're saying and there it is right out in the open for anyone to hear. My mother would have threatened to wash my mouth out with soap if she ever heard even a small fraction of such utterings. And my childhood gutter vocabulary was nowhere near that of the South Park characters. Plus, there's a lot of breaking wind, throwing up, and eliminating bodily wastes. Why would this Junior-High-level humor be so funny? I guess it's because it's so impolite and the audience feels embarrassed. Laughter is a relief, after all. And I was laughing, right along with everyone else, although I suspect my laughter was nowhere nearly as vigorous as is indicated by others in their reviews. Some of the reviews suggested that the movie was funniest in the first part and then tapered off. That's an interesting observation. This type of verbal onslaught is funniest when you first hear it, but the effect wears off as it continues. That was my experience. After a while it was just no longer very funny and I began wondering when the movie would be over.

The story was irrelevant and just a vehicle for the comic language and coarse visual gags. No one would watch the story or find it amusing were the coarse language not there. Also, South Park animated cartoons are primitive, to say the least. They're somewhat clever and amusing, but other animations are far superior. Okay, I was laughing and enjoyed the movie. Would I watch it again? Not likely.

1054836,4,6305627401,"This is a very, very funny movie. I've avoided South Park mostly because I have avoided television, and also because I really don't like to hear kids use dirty language. But this movie has cured me! I'm not anything like Cartman's Mom!!!

The kids sneak into an R-rated movie by two potty-mouthed Canadian comedians, and when they emerge, they are all talking extremely dirty. Creatively dirty, though. However, they don't seem to be able to talk at all without using the F word or the S word or the Q word (????). Cartman's mom decides to blame it on the Canadians, and the next thing you know, we're in a war with Canada.

Kenny does indeed get killed, but his death is so complicated it's not easy to say who ""they"" are in the line, ""Oh, No; they killed Kenny."" My own vote goes to the supremely incompetent surgeons who accidentally replace his heart with a baked potato. But you could also blame the Canadian comedians for showing a scene where one of them ignites his fart. Kenny tries it, and sets himself on fire. That's how he ended up in the incompetent surgeons' hands.

He drifts toward heaven, where voluptuous females await, but then he is denied admission and sent to hell. There he finds Saddam Hussein in a rather dysfunctional gay relationship with Satan.

It's just too funny to spoil by telling you all about it, but watch it more than once, because there are all sorts of quick little sight jokes and word plays and just all sorts of things to make a grown-up laugh. Wait until you see what they have instead of the bubble that held Glinda the Good Witch in Oz!!!

I wouldn't recommend it for anyone too young, but by 16 they certainly ought to know enough not to be contaminated.

1054878,5,6305627401,"The basic plot- kids go to x rated movie, get corrupted, come back swearing a lot, their parents decide to declare war on Canada in revenge.
Sub plot- Satan sits in Hell awaiting the day he can return to Earth while his lover Saddam Hussein treats him with contempt.

Ok so far? Make sense? Good. Then I'll continue. A satire which is so sharp, so devastatingly on target- and there are a LOT of targets- is so hard to find.  This succeeds by being phenomenally well written,and quite hysterically laugh out loud funny. It mercilessly dismantles every single thing in its wake with wit, verve and occasionally even subtlety.(admittedly buried in a welter of filth, mind) Nothing is safe. Overbearing parents, racism, bigotry, the tendancy to go to war on a pretext, censorship, hysteria, fake moral outrage, nothing is safe, everything is fair game, and everything is atomised in the name of good old fashioned sweary entertainment.
Under the slapstick, the insults, the inventive swearing is several serious points. This isn't just a parody, not just comedy, its really well written satire. That's why the film stands up the way it does, because it is so much more than a series of set up situations with a punchline. It is Parker and Stone at the absolute peak of their powers. I just wish I could quote things that made me laugh. I can't though, I just really can't. If you were offended by this, you were meant to be. For the rest of us, it is a brilliant, brilliant movie.

Flash forward to 2011, I thankfully discovered the true genius of the series and have seen all but a handful.  I'm a long time Simpsons' fan but I think South Park is right up there in being funny and satirical...and has the added virtue of being evenhanded in its political humor (the Simpsons sometimes gets annoying liberal/left in its plotlines).

So I watched this movie with high expectations, but it just wasn't the laugh fest I expected.  I think South Park has gotten far more edgier and topical since this movie was made, and I think maybe that's the reason that the movie fell a little flat for me.

Trey Parker and Matt Stone like to poke fun of everyone and everything.  Religion, celebrities, countries, etc.  If you offend easily stay away.  The music is surprisingly catchy and they sound like good Broadway tunes.  The film is definitely worth the upgrade to blu-ray.

Stay true to the spirit and vision of the TV series and put in what would otherwise be in the TV show if TV didn't have to cater to lame, uptight, humorless people all the time. But it is precisely because of society's weirdness, stupidy, and strange mores that makes South Park possible in the first place. It is only out of the sheer wackyness of America that South Park comes from and reason why it is so funny. And I shouldn't be too down on America. I mean it's not like were in China or some crazy Muslim country. I'm sorry but those people are crazy.

""Bigger, Longer, & Uncut"" makes me picture a gigantic uncircumcised wang which is a little funny I guess, but mainly just an image I'd prefer not to have in the first place. Where they really knocked it out of the park (no pun intended. really) is with the music numbers!! Great stuff. And I'm no big fan of musicals. Though come to think of it South Park, Family Guy, The Simpsons, -they all are great when it comes to the musical number. I don't understand people taking issue with South Park's animation being ""crude"". The style of animation is part of the charm of the show and it's characters and what makes it funny. It looks kind of absurd the way the characters move around sort of like puppets and there is very little detail to buildings and things.

The highlights of this great American comedy are so many, but the ""Uncle F----"" song is a favorite. And The Mole. When The Mole cursed god! Soo funny. My friends and I noticed that none of the black people in the audience laughed during that part which was an interesting social observation to us at the time. Having the plot center on Terrance and Phillip, the end of the world and the return of Satan -- all because of censorship and intolerance, you simply cannot top. They outdid themselves.

There are relatively few contemporary movies I've seen in the theater that I feel are perfectly realized artistic achievements. And that are as entertaining. Trey Parker and Matt Stone who are big fans of Mike Judge said that Judge did the smart thing with ""Beavis and Butthead Do America"" and by smart they meant safe. Judge made a movie that was fairly safe for the general public. I think South Park's creators got it backwards on that. They did the smart thing with their movie.

1055036,5,6305627401,"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is a film version of the Classic Comedy Central series that started the V-Chip revolution. The film is about Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman sneaking into an R-rated movie and instantlly, they picked up on the foul dialogue, when the moms got wind of this, they are ready to fight against the people of Canada. There are some really funny moments like Kenny dies and goes to Hell and sees Satan and Saddam Hussein as gay lovers. Please note that like its TV counterpart, the South Park movie is NOT for children, for it has explicit language, graphic violence and sexual contents!",1207008000,,615,4.703703703703703
1055037,5,6305627401,"The South Park movie was done at the alleged height of South Park's popularity.  It was done during South Park's early seasons when it had become a big merchandising machine where people everywhere were proclaiming ""OMG, you killed Kenny!""  For this reason, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" seemed destined to merely be a longer version of the show and mild diversion from getting your 30 minute weekly fix.

This was not to be.  While the animation was basically the same as the cheaply made tv show (with a few minor exceptions, such as the animation of Hell), the film set the bar higher for humor, plot, and overall relevance.  This film wears its message on its sleeve and probably set the standard for how South Park would venture further into satire and social relevance into the present day.  Yes, it's full of curse words they can't say on TV and it's not for kids and that's exactly what they tell you when you watch the movie.  This film does some very sly finger pointing, and no, the devil is not to blame.

But satire aside, this film is very funny poking fun at everything from celebrity, saddam, and Broadway of all things.  The Academy Award-nominated music is both funny and fantastic.  It's the anti-Disney movie. The irony, the music may actually be better than the Disney lot these days.  It's the music's quality, in fact, that helps the quality of this film rise above merely giving a TV show a full length motion picture makeover.  The songs are funny and catchy.  Watch it enough, you'll start singing along.

But there's a telling scene in the film that had me sold from the first time I watched the movie.  Early on, the boys' parents are assembling the people of South Park and speaking about the filth their kids are watching.  The kids try to talk to their parents while being all but ignored by them.  It's a cleverly done scene that speaks volumes, driving its message home.

South Park has become something of a cultural institution.  While this was done in South Park's heyday, it's continued to rise again and again in the spotlight as it continualy prys and pokes at society with subversive humor.  At nearly 10 years in age, the movie's themes are still timeless and the humor still seems edgy.

You see that it's so simple that you honestly suspect something randomly is going to happen half way through the song; but the song ends and what follows on in one of the greatest songs ever. Sung by Terrence and Phillip (Canadian actors) this song got the world record for the most swear words in one song (mainly being the F word). After this comes a film with pure hilarity, by far one of Kenny's greatest deaths and has as much gore and randomness as any other South Park episode only longer and told like a musical.

The only reason it loses one star is due to the lack od DVD extras. After playing the movie to death and wanting more out of the DVD I don't really care much for trailers of the film. And the only thing besides that is a music video for the song 'What would Brian Boitano do?' (I don't know who he is) and thats ashame because the movies great.

1055137,5,6305627401,"I was a huge South Park fan when it was first unleashed onto television screens in the late 90's.  Along the way, I stopped watching, being distracted by more mundane things.  Recently, I've regained my sanity and have returned to the little town in Colorado.  My first task was to pick up the world famous theatrical treatment of the series.  I'd heard it was funny.  I'd heard it was a musical.  I'd heard that it raised the bar for South Park and Matt Stone and Trey Parker never looked back.

I think its safe to say those are all correct statements.  This film combined with the hilarious Team America: World Police are two of the funniest movies I've seen.  From a script point of view the film is filled with the satirical, sarcastic, foul and hilarious humor that South Park is known for.  Matt and Trey are equal opportunity offenders.  No one is spared and it makes the movie that much funnier.  Combined with the great script are the incredibly funny musical numbers; each one just as amusing as the last one.  Sure ""Blame Canada"" got all the attention, but what about Satan's little number ""Up there"" or ""It's Easy, MMMKay"".

The animation is pure South Park with a bit of a budget boost.  Most of the best animation occurs in hell.  The rest is just what you expect of South Park (and the movie even makes fun of that fact).  The voice acting is also typical of the series, but with a few guests to stir things up.  Some you may recognize and others will give you a big chuckle when you see the end credits.

This movie is comedic gem.  It never lets up, it offends and inspires all at the same time.  It's like some of the best episodes they've done, only bigger, longer and uncut.  Some people may find it too much, but hey, they can always blame Canada.

For a great double feature, team this with Team America: World Police, or with Mike Judge's Idiocracy.  For a more ironic twist follow this film up with the intriguing documentary, This film is Not Yet Rated.",1173139200,,1979,4.4484679665738165

Well eventhough I think Roger Ebert is the only person who actually only gave it **1/2. The movie was even nominated for best song ""Blame Canada"" which Robin Williams sang at the oscars.

  Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny see a Canadian movie with tons of curses. When they repeat everything from the movie their parents go nuts, especially Kyle's mom. She wants to start a war with Canana and have the 2 stars from the movie executed. When their blood spills Satin and his lover....Sadam will rise and take over mankind. It's up to the late Kenny ""who died lighting a fart on fire"" to warn his friends of what will happen.

  The movie is full of clever jokes, funny songs and the usual great South Park dark humor. I have no idea why Trey Parker and Matt Stone haven't made a second film yet. I mean it's been 7 1/2 years since this film came out. I'd love to see a new film with their newer characters like Timmeh, Jimmy and Butters.

I think it is fair to not only label this an animated film but to also label it a musical as it does contain some of the catchiest tunes you're ever likely to hear. With every South Park episode this film ends with a moral to the story so you will have to watch the entire movie through to understand the moral.

It didn't help that I wasn't a fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's follow-up film Team America: World Police.  But in the past few weeks, I've begun to see the merits of South Park, and this film is hilarious and is one of the best musicals I've ever seen!

I don't even think I need to put the ""this is not for kids"" disclaimer in this review (whoops, guess I just did).  By now, I'm sure people know what South Park is and that their young children shouldn't be watching it.  If however, you let your kid see this film, it isn't the fault of the filmmakers, the theaters, or society.  Hey wait, that's what the movie is about!

Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman are four young kids in South Park, Colorado.  In the series, they tend to have bizarre misadventures caused by adult misunderstandings and hypocrisy.  In the film, the boys go to see a movie starring their favorite television duo, Terrence and Phillip.  Terrence and Phillip are two Canadians whose material is completely dependent upon swearing and toilet humor.  The Terrence and Phillip film is rated R (just like the South Park movie itself), and after seeing it, the kids begin imitating the duo, much to their parents' chagrin.  At first, they just start swearing more, but things escalate when Kenny accidentally sets himself on fire trying to prove to Cartman that it really is possible to light a fart on fire.  The doctors (one of whom is played by George Clooney, a fan of the show) are unable to save him, Kyle's mother organizes a militant group of mothers to blame Canada for corrupting their youths and causing Kenny's death (and to make sure that no one blames them for bad parenting).

On Earth, the boys try to find a way to stop their parents from going to war with Canada.  Also, they each have their own subplot.  Stan tries to prove to a girl he likes that he's political, Kyle tries to stand up to his mother, and Cartman needs to find a way to live with a newly implanted V-Chip that shocks him every time he curses.  Meanwhile in Hell, Kenny learns that Satan and his new boyfriend Saddam Hussein are poised to take over the world should Kyle's mom's war come to pass.

The film takes on issues of blame, censorship, racism, and war in addition to numerous others.  Not only do Matt and Trey expertly showcase their opinions, they do it through song!  The songs in the film advance the plot, tackle social issues, and parody established musicals and musical styles.  The boys sing a song about Olympic figure skater Brian Boitano which is a send-up of Disney's Newsies, while Satan sings a song reminiscent of Part of Your World from The Little Mermaid.  Oklahoma! and Les Miserables are also parodied.

This is a very polarizing film.  If someone is on the sides of the issues that Matt and Trey attack, they would most likely dislike the film, and anyone who doesn't like excess profanity or toilet humor should also stay away.  But if you don't mind that kind of stuff and have a good sense of humor, you will definitely enjoy this movie.",1145491200,3,3199,4.52

The writers deal with a pretty weighty issue (censorship) while dishing out some incredible humor. If you like this movie, you might also enjoy listening to ""Joe's Garage"" by Frank Zappa. Both deal with similar issues in a humorous, irreverent manner. In fact, there is a certain amount of irony in this comparison due to Isaac Hayes' recent departure from the show: ""Joe's Garage"" features something called ""The First Church of Appliantology"" which is obviously a reference to Scientology. BTW: ""Joe's Garage"" is also, obviously, a musical, but it hasn't been made into a movie that I know of.",1143936000,2,846,4.801369863013699

1055211,5,6305627401,"For those of you who have been with these perceptive, socially reflective kids from the beginning of the show I know you'll agree that this feature is the greatest justice to the show.  Trey Parker and Matt Stones' musical comedy is by far the most hilarious and enjoyable form of comedy to consume.  This is the film that works you out with nonstop laughter- you will be sore.

Although you might have seen it a dozen times already on cable, this movie never gets old.  The profane rhyming, the gags, the commentary on mass hysteria are as relevant today as they were in 1999.  If this hilarious, insightful film doesn't make you want to get up and change the world- it'll at least make you wet yourself laughing about it.

While you would never say such things... you will find yourself singing along to the always very catchy tunes the South Park creators are known for in all of their films.

As always, no one is spared in South Park; celebrities, political leaders, our neighbors to the north, even South Park rips on South Park.  With every laugh you'll find another bulb lit until your laughing about laughing about laughing.  When your brain finally unscrambles you'll be ready for the next one.

When you might say ""no, they didn't,"" they did.  And not only did they, but they sang about it too.

While two-part-er episodes are lots of laughs, they lack the special effects animation, the inappropriate nudity and curse words that every teenager lacks in day to day life, and little gems like revealing Kenny's true face.

It is easy to condemn other shamelessly perverse shows and films, but it is not so easy to do with a show and film that holds its own when condemning the arrogant, the pompous, and the shamelessly ridiculous advocates of censorship that inspired this film.  So while you might be a little standoffish about embracing such a genre of comedy, at least this form provides some not-so-subtle commentary about what's going on in the world before filling it with animated boobs and potty talk.

Trey Parker and Matt Stone are a lot more creative than most people give them credit for. ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" does more than entertain us with blatant mockery and fart jokes. It has personality (... a crappy personality, but great none-the-less). It is entertaining time and time again not only because we can associate the situations and characters in this movie to people we know and events that happen in the world, but because one of the countless implications that are made in this movie may have new meaning each time the movie is seen. I give this movie 5 stars for creativity and personality (Aside from the fact I find it more and more hilarious the more I watch it). Some say you have to turn your brain off for this movie, and for many people I can see why that might be a good approach to this movie, however I prefer to read between the lines.

South Park is not one of the movies that can be treated as a family movie even though the story within the story is lesson for all families. If you have something that can beep out swear words it might be able to pass as a family move, but it also has some nudity, racial jokes, might hurt other peoples religion, and makes fun of Canadians.

The satirical plot works on has something that everyone can relate to- even if only to be offended by it. Regular viewers and those without cable will enjoy it.

1055258,4,6305627401,"With the show's early success, a movie was quickly planned and produced before the series could go cold.  Now year later it is obvious that the rush was unnecessary and fans would like to know where the next movie is.

From the opening scene it is obvious that this is not quite like the show as Stan breaks out into song about the town.  Terrence and Phillip have a new movie out and the guys manage to get in around the R rating.  Suddenly they are in a different world.  As the rest of the audience is offended the foursome falls in love with the movie and everything in it.  Especially the colorful cursing.

As more kids see the movie and begin imitating the language, the parents of South Park rise up in revolt and begin protesting Canada, the home of Terrence and Phillip.  But as international politics heats up Kenny gets involved in a second story.  This time we see what happens when he dies.  His adventures let us see the workings of Hell where Satan enters into a relationship with Saddam Hussein.  But as different as the two stories are, they do come together is a very interesting way.

In the end I found myself with song lyrics stuck in my head and wanting to skip back to key scenes to watch them again.  Although lacking in the hidden truths that provide strength to the series, this is still a good movie if you are a fan.  I think that people unfamiliar with the series should not let this be their first exposure.  Once again, the series may star little kids but it is not aimed at or intended for them.

1055260,5,6305627401,"Just about the entire film is mass hysteria.  I must say that the musical aspect of the film is weak, but the lyrics are not.  The lyrics are so funny and burning I think that's why ""Blame Canada"" got the nomination.  Other than that some of the other songs were quite funny as well.  I think Terrance and Phillip's song was extremely funny because it displayed a type of infectiousness that is rarely seen in film today.  The anti-profanity song was also extremely funny and no less infectious.  One quality about the film that really caught me as I was watching it was the feeling of nonstop behavior and jokes.  I was repeatedly watching the elapsed time on my DVD player to see how far it was into the movie because no matter how long into the film it got, the film felt like it was just a longer episode of the show and I kept on feeling as if I knew where the commercial breaks should be, if you know what I mean.  Feature length films need room to breath so that the audience can recover, for TV there are commercials and films need resting places.  This film has no such spots and as such the film is on the extremely short feature side which works in it's favor since there really are few, if no other films of this kind (subversive and relentless animated features that are short).  Before I end this review I must give a credit to Trey Parker for writing the song sung at the end by Michael McDonald over the credits.  As I was listening to it, I thought that one of the South Park guys was doing an imitation only to learn through the credits that it was actually him singing. Therefore, I must also give credit to Michael McDonald for singing it.  It seems totally out of place because it's adult contemporary R&B (think usual Michael McDonald stuff)and then you get to the chorus and the line is ""Life is kind of gay, but it doesn't seem that way through the eyes of a child.""  After the first chorus the jokes start to pile up, but it's just nice to see McDonald lampooning his image for the sake of this film, which is hilarious in it's own right.  My favorite moment in the entire film is the scene where Kyle Asks Chef what it takes to get a girl to like him and Chef, how shall I say it, messes it up.  If you can't stand rampant vulgarity and permeating profanity, than stay away from this film because it's one of the greatest films of that kind.",1128211200,,2367,4.287640449438202

A definite must for all South Park afficianados.  Then again, if you're an afficianado, you've probably seen it already.

The movie was eerily prescient as well.  Bringing in Saddam Hussein, killing him, and making him the romantic partner of the devil - well, is it poor taste or 5 years ahead of it's time?  And predicting an American rush to war - even with Canada - well, was that was bold in 1999.

<*>  you've ever lit a fart (or wanted to)

<*>  your mother washed out your mouth with soap

All others -- caveat video!

They can disguise political points in profanity and humor and yet still slam them home better than anybody else in Hollywood (Michael Moore would be wise to watch a little South Park and learn how to really present politics). This movie follows the trend of nearly every other SP episode, albeit they throw in an ungodly amount of profanity since they can. I am amazed at the number of people who say that religious conservatives (i.e. ""those Christian bastards"") should stay away, that they would be offended. NO WAY! WATCH THIS MOVIE AND EVERY OTHER SP EPISODE! Find out what our moderate libertarian friends are doing to show the absolute stupidity of our liberal anti-American friends. Granted, they do a good job of making fun of both sides, us Christians too, but we would be foolish to get all up in arms over it. I understand that we deserve to be poked fun at. I think Matt said it best when he said, ""I hate Conservatives, but I f*cking hate Liberals"". South Park has no love for Michael Moore, Sean Penn, Matt Damon, Susan Sarandon, Alec Baldwin, Barbara Streisand, Jesse Jackson, Nazis, vegetarians, hippies, Mormons, and the like (in all fairness, the Christians get a pounding here and there, but I must admit, we can be crazy and it's pretty freaking hysterical). They actually support America, and this movie shows it. And we get a bonus, they make the Canadians and French out to be good-for-nothing, cept maybe a little fart humor. So, for other neo-cons, don't get all up in arms about this movie, they are on the side of the Right. Let it run its course because it is stealing the minds of Liberals across this nation, and the greatest thing is, the Liberals don't have a clue.

The then-popular Ninja Turtles actually had 3(!) real life adaptations, Spongebob had one, Powerpuff Girls had one and now South Park has one. While the rest of them were more about bigger issues/better animation(Spongebob) or more a action-orientated prequel(Powerpuff), South Park manages to rip on the MPAA, Canada, Bill Gates, celebrities and who to blame for our children's misgivings.

The boys hear that the Terrance and Phillip feature length movie Asses of Fire is premiering in South Park and the boys want to go, only they're too young. They manage to get in, but the film has plenty of dirty language, which the kids pick up and use them any chance they get. Soon all the other kids only to be caught by the parents.

The parents decide to blame the stars of the film who are from Canada so they blame Canada as a whole. This ends up bringing about a war with the canadians, which unbeknownest to the people of South Park, is the last sign that Satan and his lover Saddam Hussein need to leave Hell and conquer the Earth.

The film in a way rips on the Disney format of having people just suddenly bust out into songs, even when the characters know how to sing it even though they have no knowledge of the song previously. There are some hilarious songs like It's Easy, Mmkay and the ever-favorite Uncle ****er and also my favorite, a reworked version of Cartman's Kyle's Mom is a Bitch from the first season christmas episode, only it's more elaborate and musical-based.

This also had a first, 2 of them actually where we actually see Kenny's face and hear him speak without being muffled. I don't know if it's just me but he almost sounds like Butters in a way.

 This is surprisingly a very well made movie, with one of the funnier scripts in decades. Like I said, if you are a fan of South Park or Comedy Central in general, then you'll likely enjoy it more than others, but, with the exception of kids, this is a movie almost everyone can laugh at. It has something to offend everyone. The kids of South Park have just discovered R rated 'cuss epics' ala Terrence & Phillip of Canada. After sneaking in and seeing the movie, the kids have their language issues and the parents are appalled to find their children using some very vulgar terms. Soon, an all out war insues between the parents of South Park and America against Canada itself.

Celebrities are targeted in this movie. From Alanis Morissette to the Baldwin brothers, and Celine Dion to Winona Ryder. Films such as Saving Private Ryan and Patton are also lampooned. And of course, like the show, racism, sex, violence, homosexuality,... are also featured.

Trey Parker and Matt Stone seemed to have interwoven these ""controversial"" subject matters into the seemingly innocent lives of the four boys gracefully, with an outstanding outcome. The movie spends no more than 10 or so seconds to be serious with itself, a thunderstorm bringing torrential, ridiculous humor as fast as the running of the bulls in Pamplona, and of equal adrenaline.

 First of all, in a world of over concern about languauge and address, PC analysis and anxiety; anything, anyone and any topic is fair game for a right royal ripping apart here.

 Secondly, there is something about the intoxicating regression at finding vulgar, sick humour so deliciously addictive, just like these very naughty boys do (and if we are honest, just as we did in childhood).

 Finally, the fact that the main characters manage to be at once, cute, sweet and adorable while being utterly obnoxious and twisted.

 It's schoolroom toilet, naughtily sick humour and it's addictive because we soooo should not like it.

The parents are upset, They gather the kids and ask them where they heard those words and they say the movie. They are outraged that the Canadians made that movie and they put the kids in Group cussing therapy, and they seem changed but they go back into the movie and start cussing again, and they copy something from the movie that kills Kenny(You Bastards!). The moms are furious, they blame Canda and declare war on them and take Terrance and Philip hostage and plan to kill them so they can end it. But, they don't know that Satan plans to take over the world if they kill Terrance and Philip. so The kids form La Resistance and try and save Terrance and Philip, and they don't. The movie ends with cussing by Cartman, which was the funniest thing ever.

The movie was simply put, HILAROUS, and Brillant. Matt and Trey speak out against censorship and do it in a very funny fashion.

The kids are crushed--there's no way they could let their favorite actors be killed.

What we have is a wonderfully wicked, sick, twisted and sidesplittingly funny satire on America, family values, paranoia, stereotypes, homophobia, and of course censorship.  Features an Oscar nominated (Yes, a real Oscar Nomination!) song ""Blame Canada"" a hysterical send-up of American values.

All the characters are back.  Kenny, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, Big Gay Al, and yes, even Satan himself.  Funny, funny, funny.  This is not a cartoon for children.  Even if you never have seen the TV show, the movie stands on its own, and is enjoyable even to first timers.  The humor, often black at times, is very biting.  It is not for everyone.

1055416,5,6305627401,"Although the animation appears crude, the animators have worked their little tushies off to make the Colorado town of South Park and its inhabitants some of the best drawn animations in history! If you like the show South Park then you must see this movie. It comes on DVD and that's the version I'm reviewing here.

The four boys whose lives are depicted in South Park are Kyle, Eric, Stan and Kenny: and man, do things go wrong when they see a Canadian film with way too much dirty language for kids! (By the way, this South Park movie is a movie for adults, however fun it is. There are too many swear words and sexual situations that are not for four and five year olds.) Of course, the boys start mimicking the new found swear words and their parents and schoolteachers are outraged. The school tries to get the boys (and by now the rest of the children in South Park) to stay away from naughty words but to no avail--the kids go back to see the flick again! Their parents eventually become so enraged that they declare war on Canada through a rather mindless caricature of then President Clinton.

The plot moves quickly and so do the jokes: the movie is extremely funny and never ceases to hold your attention. I don't want to spoil the plot too much but suffice it to say it does actually have a happy ending! There are also some interesting subplots involving the devil and Saddam Hussein--in a romantic relationship, Kenny and his experiences after his untimely passing, and Stan's crush on a girl in South Park named Wendy. For even more fun and humor, the movie pokes fun at many other plays and movies, in particular Les Miserables! The movie is also peppered with songs that are catchy and well written. In fact, the song ""Blame Canada"" was nominated for the Oscar in the ""Best Music, Original Song"" category at the year 2000 Oscar awards. (The soundtrack is available on CD, in case you're interested.)

One gripe, however: the DVD comes with woefully few extras. Actually, all you get besides scene selections and little more is a set of three theatrical trailers. Woe is me! I would have loved deleted scenes or technical goofs to be added in here. The movie itself is only 81 minutes long so there should be more than enough room on the DVD for at least a few extras.

Yet, after all, this movie WILL leave you wanting MORE and so far the best we can get is the TV show. Maybe, please, can we have another South Park feature film? There's never been a better time for one! GRIN",1099699200,10,2495,4.488986784140969

1055418,5,6305627401,"This magnificent musical revolves around the fortunes of Terrance and Phillip, the great Canadian TV and movie stars. One Sunday, the little South Park urchins see their movie Asses Of Fire and are completely bowled over. The animation is perfect as it captures the boys' rapt attention in the movie house. The boys are accompanied by a little baby, who mouths all the swear words in the cutest way.

The highlight of Asses Of Fire is the great song Uncle F that has everybody singing along to the grand finale of Asses Of Fire, a feast of flatulence. When the urchins start swearing, the mothers and teachers of course pick it up. Soon, the cause of the bad influence is established: Terrance and Philip, and Canada in general. Concern spreads across the USA and soon it's on network news, where they even show a clip of a hip hop version of Terrance And Philip's aforementioned hit song.

The school does its best to persuade the children to use decent alternatives instead of swear words, in a lovely singalong number. After that, the kids go see Asses Of Fire again. Emerging from the theatre, the luckless Kenny, inspired by Terrance and Philip, lights a wind and catches fire. He's taken to hospital but after an unsuccessful operation, Kenny succumbs. In the meantime, the mothers are organising, forming the organisation Mothers Against Canada to combat the toilet humour running rampant.

Next thing, Terrance and Phillip are arrested during a TV interview. This leads to an angry exchange between the Canadian and US ambassadors at the UN. This is very funny, especially where all the delegates laugh at the Canadian ambassador. The Canadian Airforce responds by bombing the Baldwin residence in Hollywood. In South Park, the people burn Canadian products, including an Alanis CD.

While this is going on, Kenny goes to hell where he encounters a sad Satan and an amorous Saddam. The urchins form La Resistance, a resistance movement, and they get the help of the debonair Christo, the Mole. The plan is to rescue Terrance and Philip during the USO Show for the troops. The show itself is hilarious, with appearances by Yippy the Dog, Winona Ryder and Big Gay Al singing Everything Is Super.

As T & P are about to be executed, the Canadians attack and mayhem ensue. In this chaos, Saddam and Satan appear, but a wiser and sadder Satan soon returns to hell. All's well that ends well, everybody comes to life again and the movie ends with a spectacular song.

There are many subplots too, like the love affair between one of the urchins and Wendy. For a while, it looks like she's falling for the preppie-like Gregory but in the end she returns to her boy, causing him to vomit violently from an attack of the nerves.

But the stars of the movie are definitely Terrance and Philip as we see them in their blockbuster movie Asses Of Fire, on their TV show, being interviewed on TV and in the video for their hit song, Uncle F. South Park is one of the funniest, most irreverent movies I've ever seen. It stunned and delighted me.",1099612800,4,3038,4.709981167608286

Unfortuneately, not only did that skip church, this movie makes them start cussing, ALOT (a spoof on South Park itself, and how they cuss so much!), and laighting there farts!  Every Sunday they skip church to see the movie.  OIne day, while lighting farts as seen on the Terrance and Phillip Movie, Kenny accidently lights himself on fire.  We think he's gonna die, but he lives.  Untill the doctors accidently replace his heart with a baked potato, even though they had no authorite or reason to operate on his heart.  ""THOSE BASTARDS!""  Kenny dies and is headed toward Heaven, but because of his recent skippuing church and cussing ACCESS DENIED!  Kenny goes to Hell, where he discovers that Satan and Saddam are planning Satan's Anti-Christ reighn as soon as Terrence and Phillip are dead!  Meanwhile, back on Earth, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman find out that Cartman's mom was in a German porno.  This has NO effect on the movie.  Later that night when Cartman is dreaming, Kenny's ghost makes a quick visit and tells him of Satan's future reighn.  The kids think nothing of it.  They go to school cussing.  They get in trouble and go to cussing rehab.  They are just about to stop, but they get the rest of the day off to ""reflect"" and threy go and see the Asses of Fire again.  They install a V-Chip into Cartman's brain which eletrocutes him every time he cusses.  Stan gets grounded.  Kyle's mom starts a ban on all things Canada, inculding locking her adopted son Ike up in the attic.  They wage a war with Canada, which sparks a WW3.  During this WWS they attempt to execute Terrence and Phillip.  The Mole stops this, but he gives his own life doing it.  As the war sparks on the kids try and convince the parents not to kill Terrence and Phillip.  It doesn't work.  They kill Terrence and Phillip.  Satan comes out to rule the Earth as Anti-Christ.  Unfortuneatly, his gay lover Saddam Hussein trys to take over the assignment.  Kenny ""says"" that Satan shouldn't have to take that from Saddam and Satan kills Saddam.  Satan says that he garentees that Kenny will never have to go to Hell and gives Kenny one wish, no strings attached.  Kenny wishes for everything to be he way it was before the war.  It goes back.  And Kenny goes to Heaven.  The End.

Comic leval (dont see it, not funny, OK, funny, hilarious): HIALRIOUS.  I have never lahghed so hard.  There were times when I wasn't even laughing, just sitting there dumbfounded.  Asses of Fire was great, and the rehab song will always be a classic to me!

Special Features:  They were good, but not plentyful.  2 theatrical trailers and 1 teaser trailer.  That's it.  They were funny and all, but not much more.

Conclusion:  Only for die-hard fans of South park, like my self.  If you don't like South park, don't watch it.  If you have never seen South Park, see it first, then decide.

1055421,5,6305627401,"South Park is incredibly underrated. People see it only for the swearing and the political incorrectness. They pay no attention to the real comedy. This movie was a true work of art. I was stunned when I first saw this movie. I expected it to be funny, but I didn't know I'd be laughing my ass off and sitting at the edge of my seat for 81 whole minutes! After seeing this film, I became a devoted fan of the South Park series.

But enough about how I felt about the film; every opinion needs backing! (And I find that a lot of reviews here lack that sort of thing.) When this film started, I was greeted with a musical number. It was entertaining at best; it kept my attention. Then the boys entered the theatre. I felt like such an idiot for laughing at all the fart jokes of Terrance and Phillip, but I never was the type who pretended to have such a superior and highly intellectual sense of humor that I couldn't enjoy senseless comedy. As the film continued, even when I didn't laugh at the jokes, I still found myself smiling at the empty spots; the movie had drawn me in. But then things got more interesting--the kids got busted for swearing, Kenny set himself on fire, the mothers started a protest against Canada, and eventually the United States was thrown into war with its neighbor to the north. From there, the movie got even more hilarious and crude. Not only that, but it had something special to it--a special gleem that made this film a special place in my heart. It has its touching moments, its exciting moments, its musical moments, and of course, its moments of senseless comedy. All-in-all, it was pure genius. It had the magical feel of a Disney movie, but was much less child friendly. To wrap it all up, it had a moral to it (like just about any episode of the show), something a lot of critics and censor freaks don't even seem to notice. The moral made sense and made you feel for the characters. This kind of depth and development in the characters surprised me--I never expected to feel this way about South Park.

I don't want to ramble on and spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, so in conclusion, this film was brilliant. It was honestly one of the best films I've ever seen. Several of the best recent films have had moments that simply made me think twice about praising them. This film, on the other hand, gets 5 stars, pure and simple. I don't even have to think twice about it; there was never a dull moment. It wasn't just a great comedy--it was a great movie altogether. It had all the elements that make a movie great. I'm rambling again... I don't have much more to say except buy this movie! If you find yourself disappointed, do yourself a favor and lose the holier-than-thou attitude and get a sense of humor!",1096329600,6,2765,4.409001956947162
1055462,4,6305627401,"I seldom watch South Park on Comedy Central, though numerous friends of mine say that it's 100% American hysteria. So, when this film came out in theaters in '99, I decided to see what all this was about, and boy am I glad I did!

""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" has to be the most die-hard hilarious mature (NOT for the kiddies, sorry) animated feature since Rover Dangerfeild. The theme is generally unimportant, but basically is a parody on itself and other Comedy Central cartoons. Who knew songs like ""Kyle's Mom is a B*****,"" Shut Your F***in' Face, Uncle F***er,"" and ""It's Easy Mmm-kay,""--would be so hard to stop laughing at.

The opening musical number, ""Little Mountain Town,"" would make Walt Disney roll over in his grave, as is pokes fun at ""This Poor, Provincial Town"" in 'Beauty and the Beast.'

As a matter of fact, the entire movie is an enormous musical parody, while still pulling out it's own ludicrious plot.

Even George Clooney gets in on the act, as he portrays himself as an ER surgeon who mistakenly replaces Kenny's heart with a baked potato.

The Terrance and Phillip film 'Asses on Fire,' in which the entire plot revolves around, is one of the highest points of laughter, which includes fart gags and name-calling that even most teens wouldn't stoop to, turned into a musical number in the streets.

So it isn't a ""family film!"" Who care's?! It was intended for an adult aduience, people--GET A CLUE!

So go rent this, and be sure to use the potty first, Mmm-kay?

1055465,4,6305627401,"This movie really should appeal to a small subgroup - mature enough to appreciate the rare wisdom in much of its biting satire, but immature enough to also enjoy the coarse, twisted humor. I fit into this subgroup, but I'm not particularly proud of that, come to think of it.

It was a good movie, too bad it attracts so many kids who only get half the jokes in it. This movie, along with most South Park episodes, ridicules hypocricy, conformism, faith, and prudishness. It's the little things in the movie that make the comedy - e.g. a five second clip of Terrance & Phillip that illustrates the banality of rap music, the inspired insanity of casting Saddam as Satan's lover with a fondness for rubber phalluses, the reference to ""A Clockwork Orange"". The musical numbers were quite good, in that they were catchy and generally well done. A few things fell flat - I think that ""the mole"" and his god-cursing was simply there to make the audience uncomfortable - and I say that as a proud atheist; the ending didn't provide sufficient dramatic resolution.

The major negative is that this movie, like most South Park episodes only ridicules, but does not provide positives. They tear down the bad, but project no vision of a hero. Many people cannot bear sick humor,and this movie has it in spades. I never outgrew flatulence jokes, but many have.

 Couched in a puerile screwball story about a war between the U.S. and Canada is a self-serving message on the dangers of censorship. Among all the farting and four-letter words are musical numbers and Kenny's trip to hell after he fatally sets himself on fire while experimenting with lighting farts for a wager.

However, I honestly think that the movie version, released in 1999, is probably the worst ""episode"" ever. For one thing, the plot is simply bizarre: Kyle's mother starts a war against Canada due to a misguided effort to clamp down on obscenity. An interesting, if silly idea, but it just doesn't work as a movie. In fact, it's obvious that Trey Parker and Matt Stone didn't have enough material for a full-length movie, which is why they padded every scene possible with lame songs. (Obstensibly, the songs are paraodies of other well-known musical numbers...fine. However, the songs themselves aren't particularly good on their own merits, and I found them barely amusing.)

 I mean, really the whole movie is dumb. Yeah, there's a lot more swearing and obsenity, but none of the clever ideas or outrageous satire of the best shows with the exception of the love-hate relationship between Satan and Sadaam, which is actually rather topical given the War in Iraq.",1090281600,4,1058,4.8076923076923075

1055519,5,6305627401,"""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" should have won the oscar for best picture that year.  No, I don't remember what movie received that honor, but I maintain that it was undeserved.  Trey Parker is a comedic genius and also one hell of a musical satirist.  He has a considerable talent for composition and arranging and his ability to ape various musical styles (mostly musicals here, old and new) is very impressive.  The Les Mis number is outstanding.  That stuff is hard to do.
Parker's humor is sharp and it cuts through all the layers of hardened feces that surround any given issue.  It is wholesome irreverence.  South Park is not just ""potty"" humor.  It's intelligent, socially relevant, taboo-crushing, politically saavy potty humor.  Trey Parker is the Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill of modern cinema.  Okay, I am stretching.  But the point is, there's more going on here than farting and cussing, although I must say that all of the profanity is masterful.
The point hammered home in the feature film is that the MPAA is a joke and that the ratings system in this country is completely screwed up.  More importantly, this film exposes a culture that embraces violence of all sorts, but abhors dirty words.  All sorts of other hypocricy and stupidity are joyously acknowledged and then put to music.

It is one of my favorite films of all time.
Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sneak in to the rated R film ""@$$e$ of Fire"" a Terrance and Phillip production, when the film is filed with nothing but toilet humor, and the boys fragile little mind get possessed by all the cuss words. Then as the mothers of South Park find out about this film, it is time to reach Canada and tell them their humor stays in their country. But as Canada bombs the Baldwin's it is war. Then if the blood of the innocent (Terrance and Philip) touches the floor, Satin and Suddam Hussan will take over the world. Then it is up to the boys and their friends to stop the war. This film is filled with music and comedy. It also shows a great message that young children shouldn't watch rated R films, but I would still let little kids watch them. There just movies.
Personally out of this film, I think this is a must see film if you think it is offensive or not. It shows a great message and tolerance. You really shouldn't get offended by watching this film, behind all the jokes, it's all just fun and games. Even if you don't like musicals, trust me you will love the songs on this movie. In addition to buying this DVD you should also buy the soundtrack. It is the best soundtrack ever period. If you love the show, I know you won't be disappointed by this film.

For a TV show that relies so heavily on topical humor, one would think this movie would become outdated, but you can never get sick of it. For a while, I was gunning for a second movie, but how do you follow up with a sequel to this?  Best chance would probably be to make another movie with a plot completely independent of ""Bigger, Longer, Uncut."" Whether at home on comedy central, at a party, or on a date, this movie never fails to crack up the entire room.
It's vulgar, offensive, immature, and hilarious. It's also completely evident how brilliant creaters Matt Stone and Trey Parker are. Much of the movie is biting social commentary of censorship, political correctness, and war while many of the most memorable scenes rely on parodies of everything from Disney to rap videos.
The musical numbers also add to the colorful visual extravaganza.  The ""La Resistance Medley"" (paying tongue-in-cheek homage to Les Miserables)is one of the most impressive and well-executed pieces I've ever seen or heard-- incorporating 4 of the musical themes througout the movie into one fun and memorable song. At any rate, while not for young children, I recommend everybody see it at least once in their life.

South Park is some of the best satire I've ever seen, bar none. People who can't get past the profanity and farts to hear the show's message aren't worth my time and energy.

This movie manages to remain hilarious even after repeated viewings (I'm at about eleven and counting) by taking everything that makes the TV show such a romp and carrying it to even greater levels of excess.  About five minutes in, when Terrence and Phillip break into a seemingly impromptu song and dance number whose name I can't repeat, it's obvious how much fun Trey Parker and Matt Stone had letting loose with everything they couldn't put on TV.  Blatantly calculated to please the show's fans and appall its detractors, ""Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" celebrates political incorrectness at every turn.  Pushing the show's penchant for subversion to new heights, the movie simultaneously manages to turn profanity into a plot device and an art form.  The first half of the movie is especially devastating, with the walking id known as Cartman unleashed in all his greedy, racist, foul-mouthed glory before his wrath is short-circuited by a V-chip.  The onslaught of naughty language and gross-outs could become numbing in a less intelligent movie, but fortunately the satirical edge that has always characterized ""South Park"" is completely intact.  Human nature in general and American culture in particular are given a massive sendup, with special attention devoted to the insufferable moralizing of hypocritical censorhip advocates that's best exemplified by Mrs. Broflofski's immortal line, ""horrific, deplorable violence is okay, as long as no one uses any naughty words!""

It would be a boldfaced assumption to say that the boys couldn't have done a director's cut or something. It's just astonishing.
Of course, I know it's not Paramount's fault entirely -- they wanted a commentary, but they were turned down cause the pair was frustrated. Nonetheless, Paramount could have gone back and tried to amend issues instead of just letting this crap be the only digital presentation of one of the smartest, most incisive and subversive animated features ever made.

It's easily misleading to the haters because it has so much profanity and gross bodily gestures, as well as stabs at anything Americans hold sacred (i.e. Church, liberties, etc).
During an interview, the creators made the comment that nothing could be held sacred in this series because that would have destroyed the spirit of their show.
The purpose of SOUTHPARK is sometimes satirical, and, this is one of the two levels of the show.  On the base level, we've got the high school jokes and usual crude humor.  For those who appreciate satire, there are deeper levels of meaning.
In the movie, the boys are tossed into the whirlwind of censorship, when a Canadian movie throws Americans up in arms.
As matters rise, the two countries go to war and it's up to the boys to not only save the two countries . . but, also the whole world, as this war will let Satan return to rule Earth!  Yes, only in SOUTHPARK.

1055675,5,6305627401,"This is a film which is worthy of multiple academy awards and the acclaim of hollywood's greatest directors. South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is truly the most politically incorrect, offensive,and funniest film of our generation, with the exception of none. Essentially the film pokes fun at all the wrongs in the world like war and sexual intolerance. It is based around a small secluded town in Colerado where the junior citizens of the town are corrupted by a scandelous Canadian film entitled 'Terence and Philip Asses of Fire' which insights the children to use foul language. One particular mother takes exception to this and arrests Terence and Philip along with her newly concieved interest group called 'Mothers Aganst Canada'. A feud ensues between America and Canada which leads to a war which in turn leads to the return of Satan to earth.
The musical score in the film for want of a better word is a masterpeice. Songs such as Uncle F****r and the War Medley are both based on other musicals (Oklahoma and Les Miserables respectively)while songs such as 'Blame Canada' and 'Kyle's Mom is a B***h'provide a further measure of comic relief to a film jam packed with it already.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the two directors both poke fun at Saddam Hussain who they literally make out to be worse than Satan. But without Hussain the film would be less off.
South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut appeared in the 2000 edition of the Guinness Book of world records for having the most rude words and rude gestures in the history of Film making, but in spite of this even the most avidly religious person would be rolling in the ailses after seeing it.

""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" is an absolutely brilliant film that does something that most film makers would not dream about: creating a microcosm of itself. The seemingly ascinine plot (the boys sneak into an R-rated Canadian film, then, through a series of extremely comedic events, eventually ends in a war with Canada, thus unleashing the Appoclyps), is what they thought was going to happen when the movie was released (granted, vastly over blown for theatrical effect).
The movie itself is filled with side splitting humor and one-liners galor! Never leaving a dull moment open. To the addition of the genius of it, the fact that they made it a musical just upped the ante. With songs like ""La Resistance (Medley)"" (sung by the entire cast) and ""I Can Change"" (sung by Saddam Hussein) the movie is just incredible. The role of ""Mr. Garrison"" is remnisant of Jonny from ""Airplane!"", even resurecting spome old and brilliant jokes that were slightly changed from the aformentioned movie. The portayal of Satan in this movie is VASTLY DIFFERENT than any other portrayal I have ever seen. Satan is shown as a kind hearted homosexual in an up and down relationship to lover Saddam Hussein.

A lot of people might complain about the insane level of swearing, but I don't see what the big deal is, since they are just words and nothing more. Not really offensive as far as I am concerned. And it can be funny at times, and at least they didn't bleep it out--that's really stupid.
The only thing that really bugged me about this movie was that they had to make it a musical. I don't like musicals and think they are lame. While some of the songs are funny, the fact that they broke out in a song every ten minutes or less in the movie was absolutely corny, and the movie could have been a lot better without the musical elements.
I did like all of the satire through the movie, which is definitely topnotch. For one thing, it was hillarious to see Satan's sensitive side. As for Sadamm Hussein, well, he's still a real jerk...not that I supported the war in Iraq, but he's still an evil man, no doubt.
The plot was thin, but still done adequately. The boys--Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sneak into the R-rated Terrence and Philip movie, and then start swearing up a storm afterward, and because of that, their parents, rather than being responsible parents and trying to raise the kids, instead blame Terrence and Philip, and Canada as well, thus resulting in the onset of World War III with Canada. This is obviously an exaggeration to the problem of many parents not taking responsibility themselves for what their kids do, but don't forget that this is satire, and regardless of how exaggerated, it still makes many excellent political statements.
Yes, the entire movie is way over-the-top, but so is every single episode of the South Park series, and like the show, the movie is over-the-top in an intelligent fashion, and that's what makes it so hillarious. South Park might seem perverted, obscene, and juvenile; however, among the vulgar obsenities and perversions and juvenile antics there are hidden meanings and social commentary through it all, which if one were to read between the lines and look carefully, they would notice it and catch the drift of the message the creators are trying to get across.

Once they step into the theater and hear the F-word, things get very explicit. Explicit, but absolutely hilarious. The songs in this movie are almost take-offs on classic Disney songs. But while it seems like they should be shoddy imitations of said-studio's work, they are actually very well-written and elaborate songs (the songs were even nominated for an Academy Award). The plot concerns the four mentioned children seeing an offensive Canadian film and using foul language in front of adults, causing their parents to ban the movie and declare war on Canada.

The spirit of the show is well in tact in this movie, which achieves almost legendary status among other comedies. I've viewed this film at least six times and can never stop laughing. It's not only an excellent film, but an excellent musical as well. It's a must-see and a must-own. Just keep it away from little children.",1055980800,2,1619,4.664335664335664

Big Gay Al leading the USO show?  NAKED??  Saddam and Satan, gay lovers?  With Saddam pulling out a giant, uh, toy, from under the covers as if it were his ""member""?  The all-black platoon being assigned to ""Operation:  Human Shield""?  Terrance and Phillip's flatulence-filled song ""Uncle F#$%er""?  And, of course, Cartman's rousing new (and international!) version of the classic ""Kyle's Mom's a B@#$ch!""?  And that is just the tip of the iceberg . . . so, consider yourself warned.
Now, once you accept all of these images and sounds, the movie itself is a hysterical send up of overactive parental groups who are quick to blame the worlds problems on the artists (or in this case, the country which produced them) instead of taking responsibility for raising their own kids.  They make fun of everything and everyone along the way (including themselves, when Cartman is less than enthusiastic to see the Terrance and Phillip movie in the first place because ""they're pretty funny, but the animation sucks!"").
This movie really has everything:  sight gags, sound gags, toilet humor, a great statement about taking responsibility instead of placing blame, and most importantly, something to offend EVERYONE - Guaranteed!!",1055116800,,1396,4.9655172413793105

  Buy this movie, and watch it first for the comedy... then again with the subtitles on to see what jokes you missed... then think about the implications of the ""logic"" used by our american parents.  In an era where any cause can be enobled by the shifting of focus to children, this movie is a wonderfully putrid antidote.
  While the Saddam Hussein incidents raise hilarious parallels to our recent un-needed war with Iraq, truly consider this film in the time when it was released, not in the ""post-9/11 world"".
  Example:  Blame shifting during the Blame Canada number: a stark ccondemnation of this country's wonderful ability to pass the buck concerning the actions that our youths take.  If those discordant voices remind you of the great blame debate after the Columbine incident, it is most likely good that you are seeing this film, for in its obscene art, it shows us how we can sometimes be:  evasive, unreachable, irresponsible:  The mothers who want their children to grow in a ""smut free environment"", start the third world war (in which they never place themselves at risk) to make the world safe for sensitive American children.

When I first saw this movie in theaters it was - and still is - the only movie that I literally laughed nonstop from start to finish. People may not want to put it on the same scale of genius as Citizen Kane, probably because Orson Wells didn't use cheap animation and over 400 vulgarities, but that doesn't make any less of a great movie. Everything about this movie was inventive and pure genius, from the film's premise of the South Park kids seeing a crudely made, vulgar animated movie to the inclusion of Sadam Hussain to the absolute brilliant idea of making it a musical (by the way, ""Blame Canada,"" should have beaten that Phil Collins Tarzan song for the Oscar, if only for Robin Williams' performance of the song during the telecast).
That being said, with only three trailers as extras, this DVD really doesn't do the movie justice. And since it came out about the same time that distributors started doing the ""deluxe"" and ""ultimate"" editions (how many copies of the Terminator movies have you bought?), I just assumed that Paramount would eventually do the same thing with this movie. But to date this hasn't happened, so I finally broke down and bought it and I'm glad I did. Every time I watch it I laugh harder.

I really wish South Park was on HBO or some other channel that didn't have to worry about language and content censorship.
I hate musicals but here is the exception. The songs are dead on to broadway and older hollywood films and undermine that format perfectly. If not for the constant swearing and taboo subjects this could be the soundtrack to any children's film.
Satan pining away over living up there, meaning here.
The mole and his exceptionally intense views on god.
Saddam Hussein as the devil's love interest
Big Gay Al's musical number...anyone notice the name on the piano? If you don't know what it is look it up it's pretty wild.
Plot-wise Bigger, Longer & Uncut is very strong with plenty of barbs about popular culture, cultural icons, has been artists...none of which you need to know for the jokes to be funny. Demonstrating the V-Chip as a form of cussing control still is funny even though it now exists, and I'm sure kids everywhere cuss at it frequently depending on mom and dad.
Also, much of the humor is situational. Kenny in hell, Stan's quest for the clitoris. They're running gags but they hold up as plot points. And Cartman, the experiment of parental control by direct grafting of a V-Chip inside him that shocks him any time he swears.
The humor works as long as you don't get offended by it and there's enough offensive material to get under a lot of people's skin. But this is a great film to stop thinking and just laugh. As I said, I'm not one for musicals but the songs had me laughing along with some hackneyed direction that made them perfect.
Part of the whole South Park thing is having a laugh at your own weirdness and taking a break from being civil. Here the intensity is cranked up a few notches but in all South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut is very funny.
It would have been nice with more features or commentary tracks but hey, it's still a fun film that'll teach you and your kids new and better ways of verbally abusing one another. :)

If he wasn't working in film and television, he could easily be writing songs for Celine Dion or Michael Bolton - and thank God he isn't.

The parents of the South Park kids, incensed at the detrimental influence of Terence and Philip's new movie on their children, spearhead a movement to execute the Canadian flatulence artists, thereby provoking a military confrontation with our neighbor to the north and possibly apocalypse itself.
Although it runs out of steam toward the end, this film is frequently a brilliant satire.

South Park the Movie is a total swearfest, musical that'll make you laugh just because it's that dirty. It starts out as the boys need to see the Terrence and Phillip Movie and from there, they learn all of their new potty mouth slang. BEcause of that, their parents decide that the T & P Movie has to be stopped, BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. This is a total spit in the face of every Disney musical and pretty much every movie out there.
I gotta say as entertaining as the movie was the down side was all of the musical numbers. Now granted yes, they were done to mess with Disney but at the same time, I think this movie pretty much lost me in it's plot after the ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"" number. Other than that, it was great.

Also on the positive side is that the songs are clever parodies of syrupy musicals of the past 20 years.
On the negative side, the animation stinks, the language is offensive, the humor is often juvenile, and the movie stretches a thin plot to the snapping point.
Watching the movie's raucus combination of the clever and the sophomoric is like listening to an precocious, funny teenager who's had too much caffeine and just learned a bunch of dirty words: some times you're in awe of the raw creativity and nerve, and other times you're exhausted by the peurile humor.

Even Showtime has more extras when they show the movie than the DVD. Now I have to wonder why I waited and just didn't buy it on VHS. They really dropped the ball here.
But in the end I have to give the movie the highest rating possible because of the quality of the movie. South Park might just be the most cutting edge tv series ever made.

1055873,5,6305627401,"How on Earth can I explain to you why I liked South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut so much? There are several reasons. For one thing, it is an honest product. Not fettered by the confines they endure on the television series, the kids of South Park are free to utter unbleeped every naughty four-letter word they say but don't say on TV. And writer-director Trey Parker is free to unleash his singular brand of insanity on those who wish to see it.
Then there is the matter of not what you say, but how you say it. Or in this case, not what you draw, but how you draw it. The South Park world is drawn in such a childlike, primary colors way that it exists in its own space. In this way, Parker and his crew can get away with sketches and satires that should be truly offensive, except for the fact that you would have to have no sense of humor at all to take them seriously. These kids are and are not our children. Their parents are and are not us. It all has an Alice in Wonderland feel to it.
Finally, there is the art of the joke. When most of us tell an off-color joke, we end up sounding cruder than the joke itself. We are an embarrassment. Then there are the few among us who can tell such a joke in a way that makes the rest of us laugh despite all our efforts to remain reserved and above the fray. This is what I found happening to me in South Park. A small part of me was reminding myself that Mom and Dad raised me right. The rest of me was rolling on the floor laughing. Much the same thing happened in 1998 with There's Something About Mary, which is the only other movie I can begin to compare this one with.
So what is the movie about? Cartman and his buddies go to see a movie starring their favorite actors, who are Canadian. The actors gross out the rest of the audience members, who walk out. The South Park kids, however, enjoy every single minute and leave the theater talking just like their four-letter word heroes. Soon, they are in so much trouble that Cartman has a V-chip inserted in his brain. He gets an electric shock whenever he says a forbidden word. Things escalate, and America blames Canada for all the profanity our kids are using. War is declared. And, to top it off, South Park is also a good musical. The songs are well written, well performed and totally demented.
South Park is not for children. though they may be attracted to these cute little cartoon kids. It is not for many adults, who are repelled by these same characters. No, South Park is primarily for devotees of the TV series, who know what to expect going in. It is also for those who, like myself, go in totally unprepared and wind up enjoying what is, in a way, a whole other reality.",1016668800,,2693,4.2412451361867705
1055874,5,6305627401,"The fun guys who put this together fully intended to see how much they could get away with.  As the story goes, even the title (after others were rejected) slipped by the censors.  Once the censors got it, it was too late to change it, so score one for the good guys.
I'm pretty liberal with letting my kids view movies.  This one I keep away from them.  It's loaded with possibly more profanity per minute than I've ever seen in a movie.  But you know what? When I saw the movie, I hadn't laughed as loud in a long time, and I'm embarrassed to say it was at all the childish parts.  Embarrassed, but extremely pleased I saw it.
But I would not give the movie five stars if it was just a lot of potty humor.  Well, maybe I would.  But this one has a lot more.  For one thing, it's a musical, with original, funny, full-length songs (take note ""Moulin Rouge"").  And they're songs that tie in with the plot of the movie, not just ones where the plot stops so someone can sing a song.  Not that you'll ever hear most of them on any airwaves.
And, agree with it or not, the social satire is excellent.  The major theme, of course, is censorship itself. But we get to see excellent shots taken at Sadaam Hussien.  We also see Satan as a somewhat sympathetic character, as we hear a song from his point of view.  While they also poke fun at the true odds of anyone actually making it to heaven, you'll be surprised at how heart-wrenching Kenny's final act of heroism is at the end of the movie.
Great film.  Too bad I have to find time to watch it when the kids are away.",1015977600,2,1565,4.17
1055875,5,6305627401,"Although not a highest-grossing film of the year, this movie was a surprise success when it was released. It has caused people like the writers of the Simpsons to reconsider making an animated feature film of Homer and the rest.
On the surface this is not much more than a long episode on South Park with slightly better effects. But under the hood they developed a lot of technology to create the film, and it has definitly smoothed the process for the show's production.
As for the plot, I'm sure it's been discussed to death, but I will say that the quality of the movie is at it's best! Terrance and Phillip (my favorite characters) play a starrng role, and the show wastes absolutely no time trying to explain to the audience who such-and-such is (except for a small blurb about Ike being Canadian). All of our favorite characters are in it, without it being a showcase. And of course, since it's a feature film, it's much more irreverent than what's on the public airwaves. But again, it's not a giant excuse to offend you. It's all done consistently and it remains hilarious.
Finally, as usual, Trey Parker is given full writing credits since he's usually the one that ends up physically typing the script. But like always the show is a full collaborative process between Parker and Stone. At least, this is what they publicly admit :).",1015545600,3,1343,4.647058823529412

Its up to Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny to save the world from Satan and his lover Saddam Hussein (yes you read that right).  What results is so laugh out loud hilarious you'll be begging for more after its over.  A special note, at the scene where Kenny is going to heaven, then gets denied and goes to hell, that is Metallica frontman James Hetfield singing the ""Little Boy Your Going to Hell"" song in the background.

1055880,4,6305627401,"I admit, I was not one of those folks who ran out to see South Park as soon as it hit the theaters.  In fact, I didn't even run out to rent South Park when it was released on VHS and DVD.  But I finally did rent it in a moment of weakness, and am so glad I did.  A few minutes into the film I had to scrape my jaw off the floor, but then I laughed my head off for 90 minutes and promptly watched the film again.  After I returned the rental, I bought the DVD, and still watch it whenever I need a laugh.
South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is, in a word, brilliant.  From the Disney-esque musical numbers (skewered by the biting wit of the lyrics) to the I-can't-believe-they-just-said-that vulgar hilarity of Terrance and Phillip to the ""Saddam is from Mars, Satan is from Venus"" moments sprinkled throughout, South Park is the best piece of satire written in years, and is guaranteed to keep you in stitches.
The movie is set in, of course, South Park, home of our heroes Cartman, Kenny, Stan, and Kyle.  The boys manage to worm their way in to a theater to see Canadian duo Phillip and Terrence's new R-rated movie, which is brimming with jaw-dropping language.  It proves ""educational"" to the boys, and they're swearing with flair and gusto quicker than you can say... well... you'll have to imagine.  From there, it's a short leap to horrified teachers, mortified parents, and then Mothers Against Canadians.  And it would be criminal to give away any more of the plot.
Yes, the language is positively filthy....  Yes, the film ridicules networks willing to do anything for ratings, Hollywood families of fame, overbearing and misguided parents, and everyone in between....  Yes, there are many moments of plain grossness....  So if you're easily offended, generally uptight, or a member of any morally outraged group, this film is not for you.  This film is ABOUT you.  Find something else to watch.
But for everyone else: buy this movie.  You'll laugh; you'll cry (well, maybe not cry...); it will become a part of you.
Last note:  The only reason I rated this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is the complete lack of extra features.  The movie is certainly worthy of a 5 star rating, but the complete lack of extras for the DVD format, especially given this material that's just screaming for extras, is inexcusable.

First, the only thing offensive about the movie was that the MPAA Academy had the gall to nominate ""Blame Canada"" as Best Song, NOT because they thought it deserved it, but to make their own inside joke to their fellow fogeys the fact that, while management of the Big Studios love to produce films in Canada because of the low Canadian dollar, it was another sad sign that Hollywood executives care more about how much movies cost than what they are. It riled the film unions on both sides of the border.
Second, all I can say is ""In your face Jack Valenti and all you old codgers at the MPAA"" Board of review! The film was rated 14+ in Canada! One of my favourite movies of all time!!! Shweeeeeeeet!",996710400,,848,4.339622641509434

South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut dares to go places no other movie has gone before and succeeds in jokes and subtlety out of those areas.

To my surprise, South Park is much more than that.  Parker and Stone take aim at two targets in particular - the overinflated Hollywood/Broadway musical numbers (think Academy Awards production numbers) and the MPAA's hypocrisy in rating foul language more harmful to children than extreme violence.  The musical numbers are brilliant - highlights include the nonsensical ""What Would Brian Boitano Do"" and the over the top ""Up There"" as sung by a lonely, homosexual Satan.  All of the old favorites make at least an appearance, and two new characters are especially funny - the effeminate ""braniac"" Gregory and the battle-scarred ""Mole"".  Make no mistake, the language is foul, and the humor crude, but it took some genuinely talented people to put together a movie this funny on so many different levels.

1055967,5,6305627401,"""Uh-oh,"" as the film's tagline puts it, is right!
From the opening song ""Mountain Town"" to the offensively subversive ""Uncle F,"" Matt Stone and Trey Parker have created a brilliant satire that just so happens to be one of the best musicals in recent memory.
Permenantly skewering the Disney animated films of the 90's early on with one simple song -- the aforementioned ""Mountain Town"" sounding like the uncut version of ""Belle"" from ""Beauty and the Beast"" -- ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" moves on, having bigger fish to fry as it sets its sights on censorship with such targets as the government and the Motion Picture Association of America.
But censorship isn't ""South Park's"" only targets as its scores direct hits on ""Les Miserables,"" Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and even a jab at Jar Jar Binks from ""The Phantom Menace"" in an obvious last minute inclusion.
Cartman, Kyle, Stan and the death-prone Kenny make the jump to the big screen as do all the ""South Park"" gang with Winona Ryder, Saddam Hussein and even Satan coming along for the ride.
As I said earlier, the music and songs are absolutely fantastic (only ""What Would Brian Boitano Do"" falls short), with personal faves being the Oscar-nominated ""Blame Canada,"" Cartman explaining why ""Kile's Mom Is a Big, Fat B"" and ""Up There,"" Satan's big, show-stopping ballad which successfully grinds Ariel and her big, show-stopping ""Part of Your World"" from ""The Little Mermaid"" into fish food.
At times, the film goes to far (especially in the scenes between Satan and Hussein who has died and gone to Hell only to become Satan's lover!) and you find yourself laughing embaressedly inspite of yourself, but taste is not ""South Park's"" thing.  Stone and Parker are equal opportunity offenders and make a point of stunning and shocking you into paying attention to their message.
If you're looking for a tasteful comedy rent ""Emma"" or ""Sense and Sensability"" or something.  If you want to laugh yourself silly and don't care how dirty or ashamed you feel about afterwards then ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" is definately the film for you.",995155200,2,2112,4.929775280898877

Sounds heavy handed for a film about foul mouthed kids with cardboard movements, but believe me, it is one of the few awesome sleepers.
It's story isn't as old as time, but here goes: the main kids of the story (Kyle, Cartman, Stan and Kenny) sneak into a R rated Terrence and Phillip movie and in the process shake up a town with they're newfound dirty words and offensive remarks.  This prompts Kyle's mom to start a revolt against Canada, of all places.
This might've seemed a little too far-fetched many years ago before South Park, but Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the comic prodigies behind this movie and the TV show, prove that they can present a prevelant topic that actually has some depth and meaning in American (and Canadian) life today, and still give milk squirting out of the nose laughs.

You're laughing at yourself for being entertained by something so over the top and vulgar that you're reminded at the sheer innocent five year old joy you had when you heard the word ""doody"" for the first time at kindergarten recess.  Southpark is an exhilarating experience, it's funny and witty but that's not all, it sweeps you off your feet and your jaw drops at the pure manic energy the creators throw at you.
But it's more than adrenaline.  It's satire, it's Mac Flecknoe and Modest Proposal rolled into one with a modern twist.  It suggests that critics of contemporary culture are vulgar, their motives confused and contrived and it's about how they become obsessively controlling.  But it's not one sided.  The demonic corruption of young minds is shown in such honest way that you can't help thinking that the censors have a point too.  The boys have foul mouths because they've picked it up from television, and that's true, but there's more to it.  They're rebelling because they know that the world of taboo entertainers, the ones that corporations won't sponsor, are the only people on TV that aren't bought out and packaged to children for profit.  And these are children.  They're confused as to why some words are wrong and others aren't.  It's not because they're naivee but because no one has been able to give them a real answe.
It's an incredibly intelligent movie.  The direction is near flawless and the musical numbers near brilliant.  But we won't really be able to tell now.

The way the messages are dished out en masse to us are all at once hilarious for the sheer gall and ease in which it comes out from the characters, unnerving for the fact that its accepted this kind of humor isn't for everyone (you don't want the wrong people buying too much into this), and saddening because most of the misfortune and extremely politically-incorrect humor is simply a mirror of the non-sense that occurs in society without most people realizing it. To explain this point a little better, the feature plot to the movie revolves around a small PTA's fight to destroy Canada because they disagree with the silly toilet humor of two of their citizens: Terrence and Philip. Its funny because its not uncommon for organizations to fight against such issues, especially in the United States, but to the point of genocide and war is an extreme that is so out there it gets a laugh. Its unnerving because the way the organization is characterized is comedic but can be easily interpreted as a negative sentiment about such organizations as the PTA, and for that reason it really is saddening. Saddening because, when you take a step back and examine how these organizations really work, a lot of them really are that fanatic, a lot of the fights are led by people who are good-natured but are corrupted by their own ignorance to the issues they fight against. That however, is another rant all in itself.
A lot of the humor is very transparent, a lot of it based on the profanity which is laced in almost every sentence that is spoken in the movie. A lot of the humor, as I noted above, can be interpretive as well. The way people act is both comedic but is also a direct mock-up of society.
The only reason why I didn't like this movie was the musicals. They are enjoyable at some points, but seem to interrupt the movie at others, and are completely forced upon us at other times. In all, I recommend the movie, but I also recommend showing extreme discretion as to who watches it with you.",978480000,,2171,4.526717557251908

Then the whole story gets evn funnier with Satan, Big Gay Al, and Brian Boitano.  This film is not to be missed by any lover of comedy. The real brilliance of this film is the songs.

1056082,5,6305627401,"For some reason, I can't sit through a half-hour of the South Park TV show.  I enjoy it well enough, but it never really holds my attention.  The humour always seems stunted on the small screen, very ribald but always in an inconsequential way.  Well, free from the restrictions of television, Stone (no relation) and Parker have made a tremendously funny companion movie that manages to weave social satire using thread made up of curse words.  And surprisingly, it became one of my favourite movies in recent memory.
And not to be forgotten, but it's a damn fine musical as well.
From the opening refrain of 'Mountain Town', it quickly becomes apparent that the satire will be witty and tight, parodying Broadway musical standards for their own twisted purposes.  But the whole thing takes a wicked left turn with the infamous song 'Uncle F**ka' (I truly despise having to put the asterisks in, but then I guess that's the kind of thing this movie is railing against).  It's a nonsensical, roll-on-the-floor-laughing, swearing-for-swearing's-sake song from the movie-within-a-movie starring Terrance and Philip.  And it throws down the gauntlet for all that is to come.
The remaining songs are all perfectly placed parodies, which serve to advance the narrative, provide character development, and serve up more opportunities for poopy jokes.  All noble causes, I'd say.  Favourites include 'Kyle's Mom is a B**ch' (which if you listen close enough, is actually quite poetic), and 'What Would Brian Boitano Do' (or WWBBD, in which the 1988 Olympic Champion is held up as an all-knowing superhero).  And of course, the closing credits contain a soulful, sincere performance by Doobie Brother Michael McDonald of 'Eyes of a Child' (""Sure, life is kind of gay/But it doesn't seem that way/Through the eyes of a child"") that spoofs the drek David Foster and Diane Warren regularly churn out.
Special mention should be made for 'Blame Canada'.  Any true Canadian knows who the target of that one is, no?
The brilliance of this movie, it appears to me, is that Stone and Parker figured that the only way to top their TV show would be to up the ante with the movie.  Thus we get Saddam Hussein as a butchy homosexual lover of Satan, the execution of Bill Gates, and of course 'Operation Human Shield' in which all the black residents of South Park are not only expected to shield their white army mates from Canadian attack, but are strapped to the tanks as well.
And of course there's the swearing.  I read somewhere that this is the movie with the greatest proliferation of cuss words.  Well, bravo I say.  Bring your grandma and your kids, cause in the end all that swearing actually makes a very powerful point.  And Cartman's final coup de grace -- in which his cussing actually saves the day -- is as good a condemnation of the censorship of speech as anything this side of Newspeak from George Orwell's '1984'.",970358400,38,2912,4.852525252525252
1056083,5,6305627401,"Stone and Parker have succeeded in providing America with a scathing look at our society, one quick to place the blame on everything for our youth's indescretions on everything but the parents- videogames, television, cinema, etc. As well as the satire endemic in the South Park TV show, it's damn funny! When I heard that a song from South Park was nominated for an Oscar, I rejoiced- if nothing for the fact that it would shake up the Oscar community! A movie definitely not for the squeamish or easily offended, it also parodies the classic gulag type movies- it's not hard to get the references.

1056084,4,6305627401,"As a true lover of South Park, I thought this was one of the best movies  of 1999!
The first 3/4 of the film was childish and hilarious, just as I  would expect South Park to be.  The last 1/4 of the movie seemed deep and  mildly depressing.  However, once you look past the swearing and the  childish humor, the movie actually contained bits and pieces of many  different musicals.  Stone and Parker did an excellent job of incorporating  fascinating mucial scenes into the movie while still keeping in the  tradition of the crude South Park style humor people know and love.  On the  lighter side, the movie had lots of obscenities and just plain hilarious  scenes such as Terrance and Phillips ""Uncle F---er"" song, Saddam  sexual conquest with Satan, Cartman electrocuting Saddam, Bill Gates and  Windows 98, and many many more.
If you love South Park, this is a must  own video.
Also, this movie shouldn't be viewed by young children.  Take  it seriously when it says rated ""R""",968198400,,981,4.670588235294118
1056085,5,6305627401,"This is what a movie version of a TV show should be. As the title suggests, it's bigger in both scope and impact, and uncensored. There are  no swear words bleeped out in this film, and few punches pulled! Much has  been made about the amount of bad language in the film, and true, there is  a lot. But it is entirely forgivable when it's done with such panache and  sense of purpose. This is not the mindless swearing that you get in so many  films these days. ""South Park: Bigger , Longer & Uncut""  ultimately makes a very forceful defence of freedom of speech, and does it  in a visually graphic way that maybe only a cartoon could get away with.  It's also a very funny film in the bargain, containing some truly hilarious  scenes, and takes satirical swipes at a wide variety of targets along the  way.
Some fans of the TV show may be surprised that the movie is done as  a musical, but it works well in that format, sending up West Side Story and  Les Miserables along the way. The songs, written by Trey Parker, are all  good, the outstanding ones being Terence and Philip's  ""Uncle*****"", and ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"", both  very catchy numbers that stick in the memory after a couple of listens.  Also worth noting are ""Blame Canada"" and an extended version of  Cartman's greatest hit, ""Kyle's Mom's a Bitch"".
The animation  is mostly done in the usual basic 'flat' style that we've come to know and  love, the exception being the early scenes in hell, on which the animators  have gone to town to make them visually impressive. When I saw the movie in  a theatre, it was almost impossible to catch all the dialogue, as it comes  at you so thick and fast, especially during some of the songs. One  advantage of owning it on DVD is that you can put the subtitles on, thus  ensuring that you don't miss any of the jokes contained in this gem of a  movie. Highly recommended, not only to South Park fans, but to anyone who  is broadminded and enjoys a good comedy that also has something worthwhile  to say.",968198400,,2019,4.415760869565218

This movie is filled with bad language, sexual innuendos, and plain  old grossnes.  That being said I'm not sure this is not a movie for kids, I  think this movie is great for kids of a certain emotional age since it  contains a very important message (of course an adult should be present to  answer questions).  Censorship is wrong, and the truth is that kids are  going to find out about things they are not supposed to no matter what we  as adults and chaperones do.  The solution is not to shelter them and try  to keep them away from all of it the solution is to be loving, caring  individuals who can help them deal with all the strangeness and perversity  in the world.  Okay enough of my soapbox, back to this movie.
This movie  is great for many reasons.  First of all it predicts its own response.  The  movie is postmodern in the way it constantly makes innuendos that are  references to how people will treat and act on the movie itself.  Second  the movie is downright funny, many of the jokes are simply scatological and  anyone will laugh at them, but the truth is that much of the humor is very  intelligent and takes not only a knowledge of our popular culture but a  good liberal education in order to understand.

Though I don't get Comedy Central, I've seen about half the episodes on  video and read the scripts for them all, and have always laughed my butt  off at the incredible bad taste and Cartman's voice. (it's the WAY he says  stuff). And yes, I am a grown woman. It's too bad the idiots at the MPAA  wouldn't let them go with the original title, ""All Hell Breaks  Loose"" as it would have been more appropriate to the plot and tone. As  I'm sure you've read, Parker and Stone told the MPAA, pretty much as a joke  because they never expected them to go for it, to change the title to the  present one, and the MPAA didn't get the joke and said it was OK. The songs  were great, and didn't slow the movie down as I thought they would. I  especially liked, ""It's Easy Mmmmkay"" and ""Uncle F*cka""  but my all time favorite number was ""Kyle's Mom is a B*tch"" as  performed by Cartman, this time with a couple of extra languages thrown in.  I laughed so hard and loud at this that I had to put my hand over my mouth,  because I was actually worried that someone would complain to the usher.  And Cartman's one-word reaction (which I can't print here, partially  because of the profanity and partly because it will be funnier if you don't  know it's coming)at the end of the song when he turns around and sees that  Kyle's Mom is actually standing behind him and has heard the last verse is  one of the single funniest moments in cinema history for me. So besides the  movie being hilarious, it's actually well thought-out (I thought) and had  care put into it. Man, would I love to see the parts they cut out,  considering the stuff they got away with! My only complaint was that it was  too short, and that the insane school bus driver was not in it-I missed  her. I also was grateful my least favorite South Park character, Mr.  Hankey, did not make an appearance. I can't say enough good things about  this movie, or describe how funny it is--you have to see it to believe it.  Unless you're Mr or Ms P.C. in which case stay away--though who knows, even  people who need to lighten up might find themselves hating themselves for  laughing at this movie.

The only flaw I found with this DVD is  that, while it starts up with the menu, which is good, it requires you to  go through legal notices in two or three languages first.  Once you're  through those, though, the DVD allows you to select chapters and contains  the trailers.  No commentary here, so don't look for it.  Also, no  ""making of"", but honestly I don't miss that with this movie.

They succeeded.
It is also, at times, very, very funny.  But consider  yourself warned.",959731200,3,388,5.311475409836065
1056190,5,6305627401,"Probably not for kids, nor for the pathologically self-righteous, I highly recommend ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut."" Although laudable for its ""message"" against censorship, and for  criticizing parents who expect other institutions (the ""film  industry,"" the schools, etc.) to act in loco parentis, I doubt that  very many went to this movie for that reason. I know I went simply to see  the ""scamps"" in action on the large screen.
Because I did not  expect it, the film's musical format surprised me initially. However, I got  used to it, and ended up enjoying most of the songs. (As a side note, some  of the songs inexplicably disappeared for the soundtrack CD, making way for  ho-hum reinterpretations by other contemporary musical artists.) As a fan  of classical and opera, I appreciated the nods to Copland in ""Uncle  F**ka,"" the bacchanale from Saint-Saens' ""Samson et Delilah""  in Saddam Hussein's love song to Satan, and the allusions to Wagner's old  warhorse ""Ride of the Valkyries"" during the Canadian Air Force  attack on the Baldwin brothers.
As another shock, we actually get to hear  the ""scamps"" say what we knew they were saying on the TV show,  but obfuscated by bleeps. Like what happened with the big censorship deal  involving this movie, life imitates art here. It was strange to finally  hear the boys actually speak the forbidden words and phrases, treating them  like sacred incantations upon hearing them in the Terrance and Phillip  movie. But like the musical format, I also got used to the lack of  censorious bleeps.
Not so surprising in this movie was the acerbic and  absurdist humor endemic to ""South Park."" It's done on a much  grander scale, with more license than television would dare allow, with the  end result being quite effective. I laughed so hard I nearly dry-heaved  during some parts, including Terrance and Phillip's ""Uncle  F**ka""; Cartman's ode to Kyle's mother; the sex-obsessed Saddam  Hussein's relentless pursuit of a sensitive Satan; and the WWII-like  anti-Canada propaganda film (sponsored by Snacky Smores!). But there are  too many to mention!
To those who have qualms about ""South  Park,"" whether based on heresay or the superficial belief that it's an  excuse for ""toilet humor,"" try to set them aside and judge this  movie based upon other merits.

For the rest of us, this movie constitutes the best  anti-censorship argument that we've seen and should be required viewing for  all members of Congress, MPAA members, and anyone who wants to blame  ""The Media"" (or Canada) for all of our children's problems.
If you have not seen this before, I guarantee you will be hysterically  laughing all through it.  And you will not be able to get the songs out of  your head for weeks afterwards.

And unlike the  basic premise of the TV show (four young friends with foul mouths,  disgusting habits and repellant attitudes), ""Bigger..."" offers  several REAL stories/plotlines and manages to resolve them effectively.  And if anyone was afraid their favorite character wouldn't appear, rest  assured: the only one that doesn't merit so much as a cameo is Mr.  Hanky.
It should go without saying that this is balls to the wall  humor...just about every facet of (American) Pop culture is blasted and  laid bare, from the quintessential animated musical to American nationalism  and egotism.  And for once, the underlying story(ies) are compelling enough  to keep viewers entertained, and the one-liners and insults are just  icing.
Granted, this is probably not a film for young kids, but it is no  more ""negative"" or alienating than the evening news.  Teens and  adult fans will enjoy repeated viewings, and considering the rapid-fire  insults, slams and jabs, there's usually something 'new' to enjoy with each  playback.  As such, the DVD is a better buy....your VHS copy will get worn  out.

This movie is probably the way that Trey and Matt wanted to write South Park, totally irreverant and hilariously obscene.  It takes a sharp poke at the fabric of  society and pulls out all the stops.  Not many races or religions are  spared really.
The musical score is to die for.  Using easily  recognizable tunes from popular Broadway acts like Les Miserables and  Oklahoma, the lyrics are both funny and enjoyable. The one story arc that  was creepy was the depiction of a openly gay Satan and his relationship  with Saddam Hussein.

1056236,5,6305627401,"There are at least two questions about the South Park in ""Who wants to be a millionaire"", and the two contestants insisted, before answering the questions correctly, that they had never seen the South Park. When a friend  asked me what Robin Williams was singing about at the Oscar night, I found  myself answering: ""you don't want to know."" So if you are a person who is a  little bit conservative and likes to be politically correct, can you enjoy  the South Park movie without feeling guilty about it? Here are some reasons  that you may:
First, the South Park movie, like its TV shows, takes issue  on politics/society in a light-hearted way. The movie deals with a much  bigger issue: how people desire to make the society/nation the way they  think it is right to such an extent that they would rather use violence (or  called military action) to get it. In the movie the idea is totally  fictitious and funny, out of the theatre it is a sad cold reality. Seldom  movies I have seen can be so serious and funky at the same time. If you  think the topic is too big, well, the movie also sends a message about  children should take responsibility of their own lives instead of blaming  the society.
Second, if you are a musical fan like me, you may really  enjoy the movie. It is not just a movie with some funny songs in it; it  really has some Broadway musical style! And the songs fit in the plot  perfectly. One climax is when the Terrace and Philip is captured, four  songs from four players of the game (Mother Against Canada, Terrace and  Philip from jail, Children from La Resistance, Satan from hell) weave  together, making this ridiculous moment strangely intense and exciting. My  personal favorite is ""What Would Brian Boitano Do"". Satan's ""Up there"" is  very sweet. The school principal's ""It's easy, mmmkay"" is made just for  him.
Comparing to the TV episodes, the movie gives those F words the  right purpose to be there. And Kenny rarely has such a meaningful death.  (Way to go Kenny!) It is full of sarcastic jokes, but I doubt small  children should apprehend them, an R rate is necessary.

I am not in favor of censorship,  I am quite liberal, and I don't have any objections to this being out  there. But the language and the meanness are blunt, and not delicate or  unsubtle.

I am from Canada as  well, and I really didn't mind the Canadian jokes, but they weren't nearly  as funny as I hoped the would be.  The problem with this DVD is the lack of  special features.  There are so many cool things that could have been done  with this movie, yet all it gives you is a couple of trailers that you  could download anyways if you really wanted to.

Yes -  there are funny parts here and there - but the snatches of humor are lost  amidst the degradation of everything good and decent.
It's like wading  through vast piles of sewage and trash to find a small perishable treasure.  The enjoyment of the occasional joke is lost amidst the stench of the  profanity and revilement.

  While the characters were their usual, and the storyline was a step above  Trey and Matt's usual fare, it struck me as an hour-long television show  that was stretched to fit a feature film time slot.
  There are some  great moments in the film, particularly the musical numbers by Terrence and  Phillip, and the whimsical poignancy of La Resistance; but much of the  movie is just plain painful to watch as well -- particularly the scenes in  Hell, which seem a rather crude stereotype of homosexual relationships, the  battle with Canada, and just about any scene with Kyle's mom.
  The  movie sends up so many different genres, and is so loaded with pop media  and classic movie in-jokes (much like the series) that it gets to feeling a  bit cluttered and incoherent at times.  But if you enjoy spotting all the  references, it is quite a lot of fun.
  It is mainly a commentary on  censorship and parents who lack interest in their childrens' lives while  forever fighting ""causes"" in the name of ""decency"" for  their children.  It ultimately makes the point that it is the parents who  are to blame for ""problem"" children, and not outside influences  (a somewhat simplistic view); and it makes that point heavy-handedly.  Indeed, near the end of the film, one gets the feeling that Parker and  Stone are almost literally trying to beat it into the audience's collective  head.
  Again, it did certainly have it's moments of sheer hilarity, and  I would say that anyone who is a fan of South Park would probably enjoy  watching this movie.  Just don't expect too much.",955929600,,1787,4.766447368421052

Stone and Parker  wanted to shock the studio, but they ended up delivering a movie that  guarantees to totally offend anyone who lives to be offended.  I was  horrified only once - when I realized that more parents would be offended  by the language than the grisly depiction of the actual combat with the  Canadians.  This is more than a depraved cartoon - it's a profound message  that NOBODY will want to hear.  That makes it 13 years ahead of its time.  My son and this movie will, hopefully, still be around - maybe by then it  will make sense.",955238400,22,1781,4.578274760383387

1056390,3,6305627401,"Up front, I must admit that I am not a huge fan of the South Park television series.  Bits and pieces are very humorous and others miss the mark.
This DVD, however, I found very funny.  In fact, I had tears in my  eyes from laughing at several scenes.  On the surface, the movie is a  profane, simple cartoon.  In reality, it is a profane social commentary.  The idea that we would be upset by profanity and accepting of violence  against our fellow man (in war) really makes you think.
The DVD is very  clear and colorful and the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is wonderful.  Where it really shines is in the songs (which are hilarious and frankly,  very singable).  The surrounds are used subtly and the .1 channel is fairly  active in several scenes.
The film is definitely not for kids, or even  some adults, but if you look past the profanity to what Trey Parker is  trying to say, the film is much more serious than it seems.
The only  thing that kept me from giving it 4 stars was that, at times, the messages  were a little less subtle than they could have been.",954374400,4,1068,4.340101522842639

I am a huge fan of the show and have seen all of the episodes. Those who say it is different are all wrong. They have obviously never seen the first season, where half the show was bleeps, and insulting religions, races, etc. I have to disagree that only adults should see this. This movie was intended for being a good laugh for teenagers that are not big south park fans for a one time basis, but for hardcore fans, who actually know about the show, and how it looked when it started. If you think that it is nothing like the show, and consider yourself a true fan, then you are definitely wrong in my book. I personally think that this is a good movie for true south park lovers (like myself), and for those teenagers who are not really big fans for a one-time laugh.

Our world is moving swiftly away from  personal responsibility and this movie is the greatest example of the  absurdity of that view. ""Let's Blame Canada!"" is the battle cry  rather than ""Let's blame ourselves for being lousy parents!""  Every person young and old should watch this movie and then sit back and  talk about what it really is showing us--that one must take responsibility  for their own actions. People get way to worried about the language in this  film. Get over it. Language does not hurt people, but the ideas held by the  manical parents in this movie do. South Park is one of the greatest shows  ever in TV. It pulls the rug out from under so many Politically Correct  stereotypes and ideas that each show is a mini education if one would only  think a bit and not just zone out because someone said a bad word.

1056429,5,6305627401,"I noticed that there are several negative reviews of this motion picture.  While I can accept that there are some who love the TV show and were disappointed about the movie treatment, I was rather perplexed about those  who were offended by the scatalogical humor and the profanity.  I should  have thought that the movie's title alone, if not Stone and Parker's  association with it, would have been warning enough.  For those who watched  it in spite of the obvious warning signals and got offended, I can only say  that you got what you asked for.  Next time, try something that won't  offend your thin-skinned sensibility-like Snow White.
That said,  ""Southpark:  Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" is one of the three  funniest movies of 1999 (the others are ""American Pie"" and  ""Austin Powers-The Spy Who Shagged Me).  The picture is a brilliant  satire of censorship and political correctness along with the attendant  hypocrisy that goes along with such concepts.  Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and  Kenny see an R-rated movie starring their idols Terrence and Phillip, two  Canadians whose stock in trade is fart jokes and insults the like of which  I've never heard before.
In typical fashion, the boys' mothers,  particularly Kyle's mother, who is somewhat of an activist, go on the  warpath to have Terence and Philip arrested and condemned to death.  The  execution is to take place at a USO show where Winona Ryder displays an  unusual talent (I understand she was very offended by this portryal).  This  execution in turn is a sign of Satan's imminent rule.  Satan and his gay  lover (Saddam Hussein) are watching the signs and having their own  problems.  Where do Parker and Stone come up with these ideas?
All of  these plots come together in an outrageously funny that some will find  offensive.  Those who think with their minds in gear and tongue firmly  planted in cheek and who are not given to emotional excess will see this  picture for what it is:  an in-your-face full frontal assault on the  hypocrisy of censorship and political correctness that takes no prisoners.",952819200,12,2077,4.893063583815029

Many have argued that  the profanity and graphic content were too excessive, but Matt Stone and  Trey Parker already know that sometimes you have to hit Americans on the  head with a sledgehammer to get their attention.  Any less profane or  graphic and the movie would fall victim to the political correctness and  knee-jerk censorship it parodies.

Not only that, they've crafted an  entertaining comedy.  Some people will be mightily offended by Terrence and  Philip's big number, but that's precisely why the number is so  entertaining.  At last, a movie that makes fun of the truly politically  correct!",949104000,2,568,4.762886597938144

Watching this silly movie feels more like watching a couple of immature kids wreaking an equally immature form of vengeance once given the smallest ability to do so.  The swearing  and off-color humor is so overdone that it borders on ridiculous, and it  doesn't have to offend your sensibilities for you to think so.  I agree  with an earlier review; I think the twins have run out of steam, and more  specifically, out of things to say.  This movie seemed to be an  hour-and-a-half snub at the ratings boards.
And I have to say that the  music is nothing special either, unless you're into novelty/off-color  songs.
This is a pretty silly movie that, while it does still display  some of the subtle, witty social commentary I used to enjoy in the tv show,  still buries itself with its own attempts at shock value.  Disappointing  overall.",948931200,,881,4.741721854304636

SouthPark isn't about potty humor at all, it's a constant commentary on society. The people who didn't like it didn't  comment at all about the gruesome deaths- only about the foul language. If  the title didn't warn them about what they were going to see, then it's  their own fault. I don't have anything against people who didn't like this  new classic, but I also don't go rent movies that I know won't appeal to me  and then gripe about what they are about. This movie isn't about two guys  trying to see what they can get away with, it's a political statement about  the current state of society. When you understand what Matt and Trey are  saying, the whole concept of South Park clicks and you can find the humor  on the intellectual (as opposed to the Jr. High) level. If you want  mindless entertainment, go watch a ""serious"" PG rated movie. If  you want to see a brilliant statement that gives you some hysterical relief  from the current state of society, go get this movie. Personally, I believe  that the best way to defeat what's wrong with our society is to laugh at  the stupidity of what Matt and Trey expose about our society in this  movie.

The story hardly gets away  from the plot which is that the kids go see a Terrance and Phillip movie  with foul language and it then becomes part of their language.

And those  graphics that the movie holds...the fire special effects, the real-life  drawings and computer animation would look more at home in Spielberg's  latest blockbuster than a South Park episode.  I mean, the humor of South  Park is not that original, just a bunch of kids swearing and telling dirty  jokes.  What made it funny was watching such horrible artistry doing such  distasteful things.  That was the whole heart of the show, the bad  drawings!  Who wants to see a juiced-up South Park with better drawings and  visual effects?

1056676,3,6305627401,"Much like this year's TV episodes, the movie seems to bode the winding down of the South Park phenomenom. It was good while it lasted but the ride is coming to an end. Everything the creators wanted to say has been said  and they are showing no inclination to take it to the next level (if such a  level even exists). Unlike the Simpsons which keeps finding new avenues to  travel, South Park is a one-way street. But what a street it was....
Mind  you, the movie has  some very funny moments plus a mildly insightful  commentary on the damage inflicted when parents neglect their duties to  nurture and guide their children all the while expecting other resources to  provide it. I do take issue with the gratuitous use of the f-word - it was  funny the first 400 times someone said it - but after a while I found  myself wishing they would just get on with the dialogue. Being from Canada,  I found the references to the 'evil Canadians' hilarious. There is a  glaring error, however, when the Canadian Air Force attacks. We don't have  anywhere near that many planes and we can only wish they were made of such  good quality paper. The 'happy' ending for Kenny was a nice  touch.
All-in-all, it's a good buy but I'm not sure I had to get the DVD  version. Although there is a veritable gold mine of opportunity here, the  producers opted for essentially nothing in the way of extras. Who do they  think they are, Walt Disney?

Practically  everything in the movie is a satire of something - politics, T.V.,  celebrities, political correctness, religion, etc; they leave no stones  unturned. I think pretty much anyone will be offended by something in the  movie, and thats the point - they aren't picking on anyone in particular;  they are picking on everyone. People need to remove the sticks from their  rectums and stop taking themselves so damm seriously. If we can't laugh at  ourselves then who can we laugh at? The Baldwins? Celine Dion? Satan?

I  was disgusted just once - when this bloody sausage sprung from inside the  Saddams blanket. What was the reason for this? It's not very funny and even  amidst all this cartoon violence, profanities and gore this episode is  unnecessary and embarassing. I suppose the creators just got carried away  by the overall mood of the movie.
My favourite scenes are Brooke Shields  fart confession, the general's unwillingness to disclose any knowledge of  Emancipation Proclamation - he considers it pure hip-hop!  Also I liked the  idea of Baldwins living together with the same phone number - just  different extensions. I share the common admiration of the hit songs and  episodes but these are my special little gems.
So it's good, very good.  The only thing that bothering me now is that there are many - perhaps too  many - cartoons exploiting the image of swearing young vandals. Beavis  & Butthead, Rugrats(both of them are also represented by quite  successful full-lenght features), Simpsons - and now South Park. This is  mostly a parody but parody can not prevail  over the norm. It's just a way  to deal with common stuff, to make a fun of it and take it with the grain  of salt. But now we have much more than a grain. Just remember how funny  were the Naked Gun movies and what a garbage are Leslie Nielsen's last  efforts. The jokes are seemingly in the same vein but how stale they  became!

The profanity isn't in the movie for  laughs, and the comments and ""disrespect"" aren't in it to offend  anyone.  South Park, the movie and the series, shows how absurb we've  become in our political correctness, and need to blame.  To say that it's  an insult to people who are decent is to miss the point.  No one person  should force their views on anyone, that's the idea of what America stands  for.  The freedom to be whomever or whatever you choose.  And the  popularity of this film, from the MANY reviews I read, is not based so much  on what is actually presented, but on the absurd notion that there are  those who chose to believe that they should set the standards of decency  for others.  I consider myself a moral and decent person, and if I choose  to enjoy a movie that may offend others, that is my right as an American  and a human being.  To belittle others for what they choose to enjoy or  believe, belittles the individual who forces their own morality on others.  Enjoy your entertainment, choose what you like, and let others do the same.  South Park says so, and if you missed that obvious message, then you  probably knew you weren't going to enjoy the movie to begin with.  Even  more absurd than belittling a movie you knew you wouldn't like, is seeing a  movie you knew you wouldn't like so that you could belittle it further.  Have your opinion, but remember, it's your opinion.  Let people decide for  themselves, and support them rather than condemn them.

The show was starting to lose me, but the movie  pulled me right back.  And don't listen to anyone who says that there is  too much foul language.  The excess in language is the point of the movie.  When the MPAA reviewed the movie, they had no problem with any of the  extreme violence or gore, but instead felt that a few dirty words needed to  be removed.  This rediculous position of the United States is the satire,  and reason for this movie.  So if you complain about the language you are  just too stupid too see past it and understand its purpose.  See South  Park.  And then, watch it 100 more times.  And after you watch South Park,  go and rent Orgazmo, another hilarious Trey Parker movie about a Mormon  Porn Star.

All the social,  political, religious, and racist commentary is part of our culture; the  creators of this film are bringing this to the surface in the ""quiet,  little redneck, mountain town."" To become angry at these aspects of  society is to deny their existence; and to deny their existence is to  create more problems.

While the usual graphics are admittedly crude, and expletives  free and easy, the plot was clever and, like the series, the writers  stretched the line of good taste past the critical point, but not too far  that I was personally uncomfortable.  Kenny's role in the movie is  hysterical, as is the subversive relationship between Satan and Saddam  Hussin.  The movies largest asset is its post modern self awareness; in  many respects this movie is about its own struggles to be produced and  released despite criticism about its content from outside groups; the  issues of free speech that it brings out are important, and the usual South  Park fans will be amenable to that message.
About the DVD, however, I was  a little disappointed.  The only extras were the (horribly funny) trailers,  and the only dubbed language is French (although it is funny to watch it in  French with English subtitles).  I wanted a little more bang for my buck -  at least the making of South Park, or an interview with Terrance and  Phillip.  Instead, all I got was a great movie, and the ""Uncle *****"" song  small screen - that is the usual stomping ground for the kids anyway,  right?

Movies that try to elicit humor by making a scapegoat of Canada (like ""Canadian Bacon"") don't do that well.  The concept flops.  But no matter. The writing was at its usual delightful level.  Parker & Stone got off their shot at the movie rating board.  And I loved it all.  I felt a special connection with the character The Mole, as if he were my alter ego.  Scary, huh? I was initially worried when I heard this was a musical.  But calm your fears; these are no hokey Disneyesque or Broadway show tunes.  These are Parker & Stone songs.  You know how fun those are.

This DVD presents the movie very well, in anamorphic  widescreen.  And it includes trailers, which is nice.  However, I have to  take one star off for this DVD not being as good a presentation as it could  have.  I would love to see a Trey Parker/Matt Stone commentary.  Furthermore, I would have absolutely loved to see this DVD include the  feature from Boogie Nights in which you can jump directly to a song's  scene.  One click access to Uncle F**ka, What Would Brian Boitano Do?, La  Resistance, etc. would have been perfect.

Like every  episode of South Park, it has an important message or two hidden in what  Kyle's mom would most certainly consider toilet humor. The Les Miserables parody was classic, proving that there really is some level of sophistication in Stone and Parker's humor... But who cares about that when  you get to see Cartman's last stand against evil with only his vile tongue to protect him!

While there's not much on the disc for extras, this movie rules supreme over all animated comedies. I also highly recommend that you watch the ""Unclef*cker"" scene with the French language track turned on. I don't know exactly why, but it seemed twice as funny in French.

1056995,1,6305627401,"Given the success of their weekly TV series, it was natural that South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone would make a South Park feature film.  However, one wishes they had not, for this film suffers from even  less intelligence and greater insipidity than their series.
The plot,  such as it is, involves a war that breaks out between the US and Canada  over a movie starring the show's resident cartoon-within-a-cartoon  characters, Terrence & Phillip.  Within this plot comes what has  mysteriously been called a brilliant social satire.  Brilliant is is not;  all but totally incoherent it absolutely is.  Parker and Stone attack  literally anything and everything, and about the only coherency to be found  is a despicable hatred of those who hold reasonable standards of taste and  decency.
It is typical of the chutzpah that motivates Parker and Stone,  self-proclaimed ""artists"" who insult, belittle, and offend at  will and react with fury when criticized - when the film was released Stone  had the temerity to author a syndicated column attacking movie ratings, as  though they somehow were stiffling to his artistic ambitions.
This, of  course, is laughable - funnier, in fact, than anything in South Park.  Parker and Stone do not - indeed, will not - grasp the reality that  subtlety and nuance, not shock value, is what makes comedy timeless.  Remember Beavis and Butthead?  You don't?  Of course you don't, because  they were entirely dependent on tasteless shock value to get laughs -  subtlety and nuance were nowhere to be found.  Now, remember Steve Martin?  Chances are you do, because he understood subtlety and nuance, and could  tone down his act when necessary without hurting the act's integrity.
Parker and Stone refuse to understand this, and it is why South Park  will not outlast anything.  The title should have been South Park: Smaller,  Shorter, and Unfunny.",943920000,13,1898,5.0453074433656955

1057188,5,6305627401,"This is one of the greatest anti-censorship movies ever made.  The film-makers don't argue that there are films out there that kids shouldn't see; their point is that, instead of protesting and boycotting everything  in sight, parents should spend time with their kids and *explain* why  certain things are right or wrong.
This is a brilliant, acidic, extremely  funny movie, with an unexpectedly moving moment involving Kenny, which I  won't spoil.
The music is brilliant, both as a parody of Disney movies  and on its own terms.  I can't wait for Whitney Houston to sing ""Uncle  F*cka"" at the Oscar ceremony.",940723200,3,610,4.97029702970297

I LAUGHED SO HARD FOR SO LONG  THAT MY FACE STARTED TO GET SORE.  I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT FIVE STARS BUT THE  PLOT INVOLVING SATAN AND SADAM HUSSEIN IN A RELATIONSHIP DRAGS A LITTLE  BIT.  THE MUSIC ALONE IS ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU FORGIVE ANY PROBLEMS THE FILM  HAS AND THE SOUNTRACK IS A MUST IF YOU BUY THIS FILM, ""WHAT WOULD  BRIAN BOITANO DO"" AND ""UNCLE F*****"" RATES WITH ANY SONG  FROM ANY MOVIE MUSICAL EVER MADE.

1057190,5,6305627401,"To all those who claim that the movie diverges from the spirit of the TV show, I have this to say: The movie was made for fans of Parker and Stone's original ""Spirit of Christmas"" short, NOT so much for fans of the  South Park TV show. ""Spirit of Christmas"" was just as vulgar as  the movie is, and therein was the spark that shot it across the Internet in  a hundred different formats in the summer of 1997, and turned it into the  cult hit that Comedy Central couldn't resist making into a series. BUT...  to make a series out of it, they HAD to tone it down. If the toned-down  series is what you're a fan of, you'll certainly be taken aback by the  movie, and you might not appreciate so well where the humor comes from. But  to fans who have been with Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny since the very  first duel between Santa Claus and Jesus, this film revisits the exuberance  of South Park's genesis in a million little nods to the original (Brian  Boitano is back with a vengeance!) and shows that Parker & Stone were  just waiting their chance to unleash the full force of their genius on  us.
And to those who claim there are too many songs: Yes, Virginia, it IS  a musical. And what's more, it may be the best musical of  1999.
Delectably crafted and sure to cause unaccustomed thought in many  an atrophied mind, the South Park movie is a better tribute to its twisted  origins than anyone whose only exposure to South Park is through the TV  series will likely appreciate. Hats off to Parker & Stone for a true  masterpiece.",940464000,3,1534,4.338028169014085
1057191,5,6305627401,"I was expecting Bigger Longer and Uncut to be funny, but one of the most ingenius satires of the year? Wasn't expecting that. To my surprise, for every hilariously raunchy ""Uncle F**ka"" routine, there was a  great subtle joke about everything from religon to politics to the media.  Absolute perfection and brilliant obscentiy....yes brilliant  obsenity....while maintaining a sense of youthful innocence and classic  musical showmanship not seen in cinema in a while. South Park: Biggger  Longer and Uncut is the funniest film this year",940291200,,537,5.345238095238095
1057192,5,6305627401,"Tying such diverse elements together as a musical, the Geniuses behind South Park have struck again.  I heartily reccomend this movie to anyone who thinks that censorship has gotten ridiculous. This is also a great film  for people who love to pick ""stolen"" gags or scenes from other  movies, as there are lines and scenes from such movies as ""Star trek:  the search for Spock"" and such musicals as ""Les Miserables"".  A warm, witty and sometimes hard edged film, It is assembled in the form of  a broadway musical and remains true to what fans have expected from a South  Park cartoon.",940291200,,585,4.676470588235294

Somehow, the longform medium of feature film seems almost a superior canvas for  these artists' cardboard cut out ""painting"" to the weekly 23  minutes they get on Comedy Central.  No group, sacred cow or religious  belief is spared in ""Bigger, longer and Uncut"".  It'll have the  most ardent anti-South Park bunch even rethinking their position as, by  about the first 30 minutes of the film, even THEY get the joke!",940204800,,552,4.787234042553192

It would be impossible to make a list of all the times  my friend and I  laughed during the movie....the only con I could think of  was for about 1.5 seconds you had to stare at Big Gay Al's schlong....but  other then that it ruled!!  If you love the show I seriously suggest buying  the movie....there are those of us who I wouldn't reccomend the movie for:  those under fifteen(unless you think that they're mature enough), those who  hate the show, and people who get offended by people who make fun of god.  It's nothing big, there's this french kid who hates god, he had a really  bad child hood(his mom tried to give herself an abortion with a coathanger  or something while she was pregnant with him) so you can't really blame  him, it was really funny though!!

1057222,5,6305627401,"Ok, anyone who didn't like this movie didn't understand Trey Parker and Matt Stone's intentions. They were making this for the fans; they didn't want it to be just four episodes of the show strewn together; and it's  being a musical-you've gotta know that Trey Parker is a musical prodigy,  and they wanted to give the viewers something they wouldn't expect. It's a  take-off on all those corny musicals. But this is the only movie I've ever  been to that the entire theater was laughing almost perpetually. Anyone who  was offended by it-there is no one or nothing that Matt and Trey won't make  fun of. And no matter what people might think, they really are smart! So I  loved this movie!, needless to say.",939427200,,708,4.616

The launguage is lued but has a point behind it, which is  why there is more than meets the eye, when you watch it. The songs are very  funny and do well at spoofing Disney and musicals in general. The Return of  the Jedi ending was also hilarious, how many of you picked up on it. They  just switched a couple things around so they probably wouldn't get sued.  This movie belongs with Caddyshack, Airplane, and the Naked Gun.",939340800,,584,4.321100917431193
