8271169,5,B0018TZHDW,"Greetings;

I bought this title on dvd some years back when I was living with my family and under a different account, should that make any difference to you, but all the same. What I got was a small white crafted from plastic such as one might hold cd's in some years ago, with a little printer made cut out such as what you see in the picture of the product elsewhere. The disks themselves appear to be DVR, which isn't to say the quality is bad at all, but some of what you see almost gives the impression that this could almost be some sort of bootleg. I have seen listings for volume one on VHS and it looks real enough, so perhaps they never brought it out on DVD or that the dvd set is done on the cheap? Who knows, really. All I know was that I used to love coming home and watching this show while I did my college home work every several nights or so for a while when I think the Sci-fi channel was running two episodes a night or so. It didn't go on for long, but what I saw scarred me for life and I had to have the set.
Chaples and the likes made from bones, church hallways filled with the mummified remains of people who's family could no longer afford to keep a burial plot. People who collect real shrunken heads and give descriptions of how to make them and identify real ones from fakes. One of my personal favorites was about the famous French artist...Something like that anyway-Honor Fragonard whom had crafted great statues out of preserved human and animal remains. Just freaky to see.
Now then, what did I not like about the whole thing...Well, I would have liked more episodes of course, the thing runs for upwards of $50 I believe, but it isn't the price really, its more the fact that I like the show and really wanted to see more. Each episode is about an hour long, but I have to admit that some of the things explored just didn't always seem to fit together very well, not that it mattered though. It was all very interesting to see, though some of the people interviewed were just genuinely annoying, various punk/goth dancers at clubs or that fellow with the robotic orchestra, I could just slap the chip out of his head  for the story he cooked up about his mechanical bandmates.
I would recommend that anyone contemplating ordering this show to first try and watch an episode of it or two online, I think some of the pieces were on youtube for a while at least, get a feel for it. It is a bit of a big order afterall. But if you don't mind odd documentaries, then go right ahead and order away.

Thank you and take care...",1296086400,4,2557,4.268041237113402
