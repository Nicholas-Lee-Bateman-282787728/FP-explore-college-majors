8681930,1,B00O3XPT2Y,"DVD Review: Pertaining to the WellGo USA version. This is such a pathetic release. Not only is the movie not formatted properly for a widescreen TV but the picture quality is just abysmal. There is ghosting, jagged movement, lines........... UGH!! It's like watching a big lop of s***! And there are occasional subtitle misspellings as well.

Movie Review: ON THE OTHER HAND, the movie would of been great if not for this crappy release.

In Conclusion: Yes, it is unfortunate that I had to buy the BONZAI, PanMedia version to get at least something of descent quality. And though the Bonzai version has the same formatting issue, the picture was a lot better. So thus, -100 stars for the DVD and 4 1/2 stars for Trial Of The Broken Blade.",1422835200,3,739,4.676923076923077
8681931,1,B00O3XPT2Y,"A great movie, but this is a terrible, non-anamorphic, standard definition transfer.  The company claims this is the print Celestial Pictures gave them, but the region 3 Hong Kong release from a decade ago was anamorphic.  To add insult to injury, WellGo USA listed the dvd as 16X9.",1421193600,5,282,4.854166666666667
