Story line set in the late 18th century, City of Vice tells the story of London's first police force the Bow street runners lead by John (Iain Glen) and Henry Fielding (Ian McDiarmid) --- London is a centre for debauchery with pick pockets, thieves, murderers and prostitutes, plus gang warfare combines the excitement of contemporary crime drama with actual historical events, this graphic, five part series follows magistrate and author Henry Fielding, his blind half brother John and the Bow Street Runners on their quest to clean up the streets of 18th century London amidst a population of prostitutes, pimps, gangs and villains --- Was very much impressed by the filming of the streets in that three dimensional dark style, the general Gothic- feel of depressingly, stifling despair is fantastic --- A great atmosphere! --- The two brothers are great actors and fascinating figures representing morality and justice, one Anglican one catholic, one blind one seeing. Great contrasts and characterization --- BBC and Koch Vision release.

3144903,1,B0015I2SMY,I really cannot believe that story lines this violent and horrible are considered to be entertainment. I have to wonder about a writer who would imagine such horrible scenes and it is offensive and disturbing that anyone would present this as entertainment,1513036800,,256,5.119047619047619

3144905,1,B0015I2SMY,"The story probably had potential but something went wrong. I watched the first episode and it was boring and with poor dialogs. It was absolutely no need for a scene with some scumbag killing a dog. I did not even understand how it was related to the plot.
Iain Glen alone is not enough to make this series worth watching...",1511827200,,324,4.416666666666667
3144906,2,B0015I2SMY,Not a fan of the dog clubbing scene. Did that REALLY need to be in there?????? Could have told the story without that. Probably will not watch the remaining episodes.,1510876800,2,166,4.566666666666666
3144907,4,B0015I2SMY,"I enjoyed the examination of the genesis of policing in London that this series portrays.  It seems hard to modern minds to think that there was a time when police forces did not exist.  City of Vice was a great look into the era, showing the disparity between classes and the justice they received.  The acting was very good, the cinematography added the right amount of melancholy, and the dialog was freshly honest in how people really did speak (and swear) which is something most costume dramas omit.
The biggest complaint I have about the series is that there are only five episodes, such a shame!  I was quite disappointed to reach the last one and realize that there were no more.  I am sure that the writers could have come up with more!",1509753600,2,746,4.537313432835821
3144908,1,B0015I2SMY,"There was absolutely NO reason to show a helpless dog be clubbed to death.  I stopped watching after that, should have just stopped watching after the opening sexual abuse and violence.  SHAME on the writers, producers, director and all involved with this show.  Its just unbelievable that production money goes to garbage like this.  Life is too short.  I wish I could erase the dog murder from my mind.",1509062400,4,404,4.797101449275362

3144910,3,B0015I2SMY,"MRE 2017.10.21: Meh.  An okay little series.  But like so many British shows they stop after a few episodes.  One positive is that this series encouraged me to look up the real history around the characters.  Very interesting.  Good show to watch if you've not got anything else to see, and like historical drama.  Also interesting to see Emperor Palpatine and Ser Jorah Mormont running about together.",1508544000,,402,4.925373134328358
3144911,3,B0015I2SMY,"I love UK dramas/crime, but this series didn't do it for me. The acting was uneven, the storylines flimsy, and there wasn't any suspense.",1507680000,,137,4.75

3144913,1,B0015I2SMY,"A first episode with extreme animal abuse! Why? Psychopathy has become Hollywood's "" sick norm"" as a means of profit. Again, why? I suspect that these kind of shows are created beyond the research needed to satisfy investors. If true, there is no wonder that our society is marked by extreme acts of violence (see Vegas 2017). Animals are bound by innocence and as such, the assumption of psychopathy within a story line need not portray their suffering as it deviates from any purpose. Human ""evil"" lacks any purpose whereas an animal remains bound. That is, a line exists within public media and when it is crossed, those with empathy should remain suspect of any approval.

For example, the producers of this show are suspect if not completely incompetent. Portraying the extreme mutilation of an animal by clubbing it to death as it was depicted in this show does not constitute any degree of entertainment. Rather, this has become a common tactic for the dollar value of ""empty shock"" for the encephalitic masses.",1507248000,5,1018,4.884393063583815
3144914,4,B0015I2SMY,"Might change this post when finished with the series, but so far so good. It's entertaining, and offering history trivia (whether it's true, or not I don't know, but still interesting nonetheless). Don't usually rate and post this early, but I believe this series will be enjoyed, and liked.",1507075200,,291,4.959183673469388
3144915,5,B0015I2SMY,This is a great period piece and historically accurate. I read a history of the Bow Street runners several years ago and this series brought the story to life. Great acting and settings.,1506988800,,186,4.666666666666667
3144916,5,B0015I2SMY,Interesting historical piece elevated by an array of excellent actors.  Highly recommended.,1506556800,,91,6.583333333333333
3144917,4,B0015I2SMY,I am so pleased to have come upon this short series.  I didn't know Fielding was a magistrate or that he and his brother founded the Bow Street Runners.  Great cast and interesting episodes on life in 18th c London.,1505952000,2,215,4.35
3144918,2,B0015I2SMY,"I watched Episode 1. It failed to produce any drama, any reason to continue watching this show. I'm not going to bother with Episode 2.
Great acting doesn't matter if the story doesn't tickle the imagination in some way and this fails that test with a thud.",1505865600,3,257,4.48936170212766
3144919,2,B0015I2SMY,"This program would possibly get at least a four star rating, but by episode 2 when I had to stop watching, the captions, which I depend on, were either garbled or complete gibberish, as well as being way out of sync with the video, or else were often missing altogether. I intended to include this information for those who have to have subtitles, but I have just read from some other reviews that a lot of the time the spoken audible dialog itself is reduced to unintelligible murmuring, further obscured by background noise. So there may be problems with all dialog. This is an unusual and fascinating subject, that appears to be accurately represented as far as storyline. I don't believe it is unnecessarily pornographic or violent, certainly far less so than too much of everything else available. Production values are high. Actors are excellent, but I think may be limited by poor or slow direction, so it seems to drag at times. Might better hold my interest if all the dialog was provided.
 The only other issue I have, is something I'm seeing more and more often in British historical productions. I wonder if anyone else has noticed it? What is this fixation on representing every single character, regardless of age, class, health, or circumstance, as pasty-faced, unkempt, either gouty or cadaverous slobs? This, and I suspect intentional direction, is beginning to successfully turn even the most attractive actors into this ugly ghoulish vision, which is not only unpleasant to watch, more a chore than entertainment, but inaccurate. If this trend is supposed to be in the interest of reality and accuracy, I would suggest that the people responsible should go back to college and get a crash course on classical paintings, which, at latest by the 18th century on, were the photographs of the time, the closest thing we have to a historical record. Not everyone looked like a dead troglodyte. If it's just supposed to a rebellion against glamour, it's been carried a little too far.",1505779200,,1997,4.890855457227139

3144921,5,B0015I2SMY,"Fun, interesting show with high production values and terrific acting. While the subject matter is PG 13, it's hardly more than that. Anything that's shown is part of the story rather than being gratuitous. I saw a breast or two and some leg. There is a shot of people having sex but they are fully dressed. As long as you realize people had sex back then and women had breasts then as well, it shouldn't  be too alarming. The people who complain about this being ""filth""..... they must not get out much.",1505606400,6,504,4.478260869565218
3144922,5,B0015I2SMY,"I really loved this series. It was very smart and well written. For those reviewers who complained about the brutality or ""smuttiness"" of the episodes,I say that that is how London was back then. They tell you time and time again that those are the very reasons they needed to incorpoarate the Bow St. Runners. This series is far better than any of the modern Police movies and series put out these days (With LOTS of gratuitous violence and sex as well!). I wish there were more episodes!!",1505606400,6,490,4.579545454545454

3144937,4,B0015I2SMY,"Very well executed series, and presumably historically accurate.  It's not easy to watch, nor are its protagonists eminently or exclusively likeable. The mores, ideas, prejudices, injustices of that time period are both glaring and disturbing and edifying.  Not a happy ride at all, but a truly interesting one.",1504310400,7,311,5.458333333333333

Great history and a  true cautionary story for our times or really any time period .Shows  when there is no security infrastructure  how society runs amuck.

3144941,5,B0015I2SMY,"Firstly I'd rate this just short of 5 stars but I can't give 4.5 as a rating. It's certainly better than ""I like it"".

There are a couple of detailed reviews of the series that describe it very well and are far more erudite than this poor scribe could hope to be. I recommend a read of those to get an accurate preview of this tiny but well formed gem of a series.

This is a high quality production with excellent acting and script.

One reviewer commented that it was nigh on porn and several have mentioned that it is pretty graphic in parts. It is certainly not one for the kids. The series is about crime and as such does not deal with genteel people. The times were brutal and the series would not be realistic if this was not portrayed. This is a progam for adults but it is not titillation.

I highly recommend a view of this one. It is a real shame that there are only these few episodes.",1405123200,5,897,4.167630057803469

3144953,4,B0015I2SMY,"It's a lovely imagining of the period. There is slightly ponderous acting and slow pace of story sometimes, but one imagines that was the reality for gentlefolk at that time. Each episode has a twist, a moral and a few snippets of research of the time and place. My girlfriend spent many years in London and delights in the wandering over its map. This series finished too soon. Oh well, we have Ripper street.",1388966400,,410,4.554054054054054
3144954,3,B0015I2SMY,"I did not enjoy this series as I thought I would.  It was dark and depressing for much of the series.  The actors were credible and did as much as they could with the subject matter.  I guess I'm glad I saw it, for pure curiosity sake.  But do not care to see it again.",1375747200,4,269,3.8363636363636364
3144955,4,B0015I2SMY,"This is not a pretty as a picture postcard lolly box view of 18th century London.

I really enjoyed it, in all it's somewhat gory reality.",1350432000,2,293,4.764705882352941
3144956,4,B0015I2SMY,"I played a DVD copy of ""City of Vice"" on an inexpensive Blu-ray player I recently purchased from Amazon, and the picture quality of the series is excellent!  What might look dark on a DVD player is remarkably stylish, even beautiful, on my Blu-ray player.",1339632000,,255,4.666666666666667
3144957,5,B0015I2SMY,"Well researched, well acted and well staged, without sacrifice to modern correctness or language - yes, this is the other side of the coin, and the language then was rough, as was the life for many, but people still poured into London by the thousands every year from the countryside seeking work, opportunity, fame, or just anonymity. There was nothing anywhere like London and it was seductive. During this period London's population stayed static despite the constant in-migration from the countryside, because the city consumed people like a monster: crime, overcrowding, bad food, gin - it's all here: The staging claustrophobic, shadowy and very real, the mapping innovative, the camera work nuanced and almost speaking, the fight scenes convincing. There's a great deal of humour in this series, as well, some of it very gallows, but that was another feature of the 18th century - a sense of black, ironic humour which may even seem a little callous to us today. The viewer sees how really rough the brothers had it during a time when you could get held up in Hyde Park at high noon by a highwayman, with little help but a few fellow crusaders like Saunders Welch. Henry alone, and then later (which this series depicts) with his younger half-brother John, fought 12-16 hours a day to keep the peace and to somehow, some way, put a stop to the Hydra-headed monster called crime that was devouring London. All in the face of deep distrust of anything resembling a standing police force from the mob and the aristocracy alike. The Brothers Fielding's efforts were paid from secret service money.

Here is where it all began, drawn from contemporary records (the Bow Court records) with a good job done even in small details. The series is worth watching more than once not only for pleasure, but to catch some of the subtleties.

Ian McDiarmid is older than the Fielding he plays, who died at 47, but he really captures the spirit of the man so well, his humour and his rough tongue, his passion and that awful gout - it could hardly be better! Even the way he guzzles rather than sipping his wine - Fielding could take down 3 bottles of port in an evening - with almost palpable pleasure. I feel John is also played quite well by Iain Glen, with a very haunting and really quite creepy questioning of a gang member in one of the latter episodes.  This includes portraying the struggles the brothers first had working together until they could come to an understanding and a system - in his early 30s at this time, John was an ex-military man (he had had his eyes injured at 19 in the Navy, and later went blind by the 'ministrations' of a supposed noted London eye surgeon. He didn't have a barrister brother for nothing; Henry sued for 400-500); and like his brother, brilliant, if less wild. Although John looked up to and admired Henry, and Henry loved ""dear Jack"", their distinct and at times contradictory personalities were bound to clash under the constant pressure.

This is styled as a police drama - it is in a way a fictionalized account of a factual occurrence, based on solid historical research with the Fielding brothers working as detectives; something which, as noted in Hue and Cry (Patrick Pringle) actually did happen. In fact, John Fielding was a predecessor of Sherlock Holmes in implementing deductive reasoning in investigation.  Henry did similarly in his close questioning and investigation, with subsequent recording, of various cases. Very unfortunately, much was lost when the Lord Gordon rioters torched Sir John Fielding's house in the 1780s, burning many of Henry Fielding's papers and notes, so in fact it is very difficult to recreate the exact methods of detection and interrogation.

The molly houses, the taverns, the dirt, the foul language and, yes, the mores, are all here and distinctly 18th century. I have only two bones to pick with the production - one is WHERE IS SEASON 2?? The other is, that leonine mane of hair John Fielding sported was not a wig - it was his own hair.

Notes to US viewers:
1.  This is not a dramatization of the excellent Sir John Fielding novels. It is the story of the inception of the Bow Street Runners.
2.  This is not a Hollywood production.",1246060800,18,4222,4.748976807639837
3144958,1,B0015I2SMY,"For those who were expecting Bruce Alexanders books to be faithfully represented on video, I only have 3 words for you don't buy this.  The story lines were full of characters not in the books, sexual story lines not in the books etc.  My advice is to stay with the books, a much more enjoyable way to spend an hour or two living in old London Town.",1242345600,3,349,4.1940298507462686
3144959,4,B0015I2SMY,"TV series City of Vice has a great true-life pitch - the efforts of brothers Henry and John Fielding (the author of Tom Jones and a celebrated blind magistrate, played by Ian McDiarmid and Iain Glen respectively) to form England's first police force amid the squalor and near-apocalyptic lawlessness of a London already bursting at the seams in 1753. With the massive growth of cities (especially London) and a nationwide addiction to gin that makes modern problems with drugs look almost quaint, the 17-18th century was perhaps the most violent era in British history (though, despite dealing with murder, child prostitution, rape and sundry perversions, the series is not nearly so violent), yet the brothers still faced hostility from an aristocracy who could afford private protection to what they saw as an instrument of tyranny more suited to foreigners than free Englishmen. While the show sometimes downplays the casual violence, the brothers' morality, though seen from a 20th century perspective, is distinctly 18th century - they are not above ruining the odd reputation or contriving a robbery on a recalcitrant would-be patron to secure the Bow Street Runners' future. Nor does it turn them into glowing examples of police work. They're an almost fumbling band of detectives - as the first in their field, they're unsure even of how to investigate a murder (""How is it done?"" ""Ask questions?"") - and often they uphold the principle of the law with disastrous consequences to the victims of crimes.

The series too feels like it's still feeling its way along and doesn't always have the full confidence of its backers at Channel 4 - the metropolis a little underpopulated at times, the budgetary limitations apparent in the less-than-bustling streets and the nighttime hangings that fail to hide the lack of crowds. Yet often it manages to paper over the cracks with surprising style, using animated street maps of London to link scenes and adding scaffolding to sets they can't afford to build in their entirety to give an impression of a city at once sprouting up and falling down (literally in one scene of a slum collapsing, tenants and all). It's convincingly foul mouthed (""The Devil **** you, Mr Fielding!"" is one of the more minor terms of abuse), with McDiarmid deserving special praise for his tireless efforts to restore the word `****ster' to the common modern-day vocabulary. Despite the grim material it's not without moments of wit - Henry's wife, a former maid, cannot help herself from doing the housework - and if it's at times overly reliant on narration to fill the audience in on details, at least it's genuinely informative. The formidable John Fielding's abilities sometimes tend to get short shrift - he tends to get typed as the stern, unyielding one - and some of the guest stars are surprisingly awkward - Juliet Aubrey's strange inflection and Gary Lewis' often inaudible insular distemperate delivery make the lack of subtitles particularly problematic, but despite its problems the six episodes are compelling and intriguing enough to leave you hoping for a more fully realised second series.",1241740800,6,3134,5.073643410852713
3144960,1,B0015I2SMY,"This purchase taught us a lesson - don't buy a DVD before you've seen at least one episode. After watching the first two hours, we gave up simply because we couldn't undersand much of the dialog. Some heavy accents,  poor audio pick-up and constant background sound effects combined to make the dialog unintelligible about 30% of the time.
Too bad, because the video portrayed the seamy side of London very well.",1230422400,9,412,4.802816901408451
3144961,5,B0015I2SMY,"I saw this series elsewhere and just had to add it to my collection.  What this series managed to do was show the grubbiness and violence of the early 18th century and offer entertaining stories of the birth of English policing.

It certainly helps to know a little bit of both 1) the situation in London prior to the Fielding brothers and 2) the attitude of the English to the idea of a public police force.

In the years before this series was set the usual method of capturing criminals was to offer a reward.  This was done by both the state and private individuals.  Private individuals would then produce the criminals and/or the stolen goods in order to receive the reward. The upshot of this was the creation of a system where the people who caught the criminals were often hand in glove with the criminals.  The thief takers would also manufacture evidence against innocent individuals if the true criminal could not be found or would give him a sufficiently large bribe.  Jonathan Wilde,the self-styled ""Thief-taker General of England and Ireland"", was the most notorious of this fraternity.  He was hanged in 1725 for his more criminal activities.

As for the attitude of the English toward a public police force, they didn't want one.  An Englishman's home was his castle and he did not want to be forced to allow an outside force into his home.  This attitude is very clear in the first episode and the third.

So the proposed course the Fielding brothers took in trying to track down criminals was very forward thinking and done in the teeth of quite a bit of opposition.

I think the depiction of the London underworld was very realistic.  It's probably too gritty for the taste of some, and I admit to wincing at times, myself, but I could not fault the production for being anachronistic. There's brief but not gratuitous nudity.  The lighting appears natural.  A high quality television screen is needed to pick up the details.

I find the depiction of the homosexual life in London at the time very interesting.  It brought to might Diana Gabaldon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-John-and-the-Private-Matter/dp/B00081GZY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord John and the Private Matter</a>&nbsp;set a few years later in a similar milieu.

Story line set in the late 18th century, City of Vice tells the story of London's first police force the Bow street runners lead by John (Iain Glen) and Henry Fielding (Ian McDiarmid) --- London is a centre for debauchery with pick pockets, thieves, murderers and prostitutes, plus gang warfare combines the excitement of contemporary crime drama with actual historical events, this graphic, five part series follows magistrate and author Henry Fielding, his blind half brother John and the Bow Street Runners on their quest to clean up the streets of 18th century London amidst a population of prostitutes, pimps, gangs and villains --- Was very much impressed by the filming of the streets in that three dimensional dark style, the general Gothic- feel of depressingly, stifling despair is fantastic --- A great atmosphere! --- The two brothers are great actors and fascinating figures representing morality and justice, one Anglican one catholic, one blind one seeing.

3379404,4,B0015I2SMY,"I enjoyed the examination of the genesis of policing in London that this series portrays.  It seems hard to modern minds to think that there was a time when police forces did not exist.  City of Vice was a great look into the era, showing the disparity between classes and the justice they received.  The acting was very good, the cinematography added the right amount of melancholy, and the dialog was freshly honest in how people really did speak (and swear) which is something most costume dramas omit.
The biggest complaint I have about the series is that there are only five episodes, such a shame!  I was quite disappointed to reach the last one and realize that there were no more.  I am sure that the writers could have come up with more!",1509753600,2,746,4.537313432835821

3379410,1,B0015I2SMY,"A first episode with extreme animal abuse! Why? Psychopathy has become Hollywood's "" sick norm"" as a means of profit. Again, why? I suspect that these kind of shows are created beyond the research needed to satisfy investors. If true, there is no wonder that our society is marked by extreme acts of violence (see Vegas 2017). Animals are bound by innocence and as such, the assumption of psychopathy within a story line need not portray their suffering as it deviates from any purpose. Human ""evil"" lacks any purpose whereas an animal remains bound. That is, a line exists within public media and when it is crossed, those with empathy should remain suspect of any approval.

For example, the producers of this show are suspect if not completely incompetent. Portraying the extreme mutilation of an animal by clubbing it to death as it was depicted in this show does not constitute any degree of entertainment. Rather, this has become a common tactic for the dollar value of ""empty shock"" for the encephalitic masses.",1507248000,5,1018,4.884393063583815

3379415,2,B0015I2SMY,"I watched Episode 1. It failed to produce any drama, any reason to continue watching this show. I'm not going to bother with Episode 2.
Great acting doesn't matter if the story doesn't tickle the imagination in some way and this fails that test with a thud.",1505865600,3,257,4.48936170212766
3379416,2,B0015I2SMY,"This program would possibly get at least a four star rating, but by episode 2 when I had to stop watching, the captions, which I depend on, were either garbled or complete gibberish, as well as being way out of sync with the video, or else were often missing altogether. I intended to include this information for those who have to have subtitles, but I have just read from some other reviews that a lot of the time the spoken audible dialog itself is reduced to unintelligible murmuring, further obscured by background noise. So there may be problems with all dialog. This is an unusual and fascinating subject, that appears to be accurately represented as far as storyline. I don't believe it is unnecessarily pornographic or violent, certainly far less so than too much of everything else available. Production values are high. Actors are excellent, but I think may be limited by poor or slow direction, so it seems to drag at times. Might better hold my interest if all the dialog was provided.
 The only other issue I have, is something I'm seeing more and more often in British historical productions. I wonder if anyone else has noticed it? What is this fixation on representing every single character, regardless of age, class, health, or circumstance, as pasty-faced, unkempt, either gouty or cadaverous slobs? This, and I suspect intentional direction, is beginning to successfully turn even the most attractive actors into this ugly ghoulish vision, which is not only unpleasant to watch, more a chore than entertainment, but inaccurate. If this trend is supposed to be in the interest of reality and accuracy, I would suggest that the people responsible should go back to college and get a crash course on classical paintings, which, at latest by the 18th century on, were the photographs of the time, the closest thing we have to a historical record. Not everyone looked like a dead troglodyte. If it's just supposed to a rebellion against glamour, it's been carried a little too far.",1505779200,,1997,4.890855457227139

3379418,5,B0015I2SMY,"Fun, interesting show with high production values and terrific acting. While the subject matter is PG 13, it's hardly more than that. Anything that's shown is part of the story rather than being gratuitous. I saw a breast or two and some leg. There is a shot of people having sex but they are fully dressed. As long as you realize people had sex back then and women had breasts then as well, it shouldn't  be too alarming.

For those reviewers who complained about the brutality or ""smuttiness"" of the episodes,I say that that is how London was back then. They tell you time and time again that those are the very reasons they needed to incorpoarate the Bow St. Runners. This series is far better than any of the modern Police movies and series put out these days (With LOTS of gratuitous violence and sex as well!).

There are a couple of detailed reviews of the series that describe it very well and are far more erudite than this poor scribe could hope to be. I recommend a read of those to get an accurate preview of this tiny but well formed gem of a series.

This is a high quality production with excellent acting and script.

One reviewer commented that it was nigh on porn and several have mentioned that it is pretty graphic in parts. It is certainly not one for the kids. The series is about crime and as such does not deal with genteel people. The times were brutal and the series would not be realistic if this was not portrayed. This is a progam for adults but it is not titillation.

3379454,5,B0015I2SMY,"Well researched, well acted and well staged, without sacrifice to modern correctness or language - yes, this is the other side of the coin, and the language then was rough, as was the life for many, but people still poured into London by the thousands every year from the countryside seeking work, opportunity, fame, or just anonymity. There was nothing anywhere like London and it was seductive. During this period London's population stayed static despite the constant in-migration from the countryside, because the city consumed people like a monster: crime, overcrowding, bad food, gin - it's all here: The staging claustrophobic, shadowy and very real, the mapping innovative, the camera work nuanced and almost speaking, the fight scenes convincing. There's a great deal of humour in this series, as well, some of it very gallows, but that was another feature of the 18th century - a sense of black, ironic humour which may even seem a little callous to us today. The viewer sees how really rough the brothers had it during a time when you could get held up in Hyde Park at high noon by a highwayman, with little help but a few fellow crusaders like Saunders Welch. Henry alone, and then later (which this series depicts) with his younger half-brother John, fought 12-16 hours a day to keep the peace and to somehow, some way, put a stop to the Hydra-headed monster called crime that was devouring London. All in the face of deep distrust of anything resembling a standing police force from the mob and the aristocracy alike. The Brothers Fielding's efforts were paid from secret service money.

Here is where it all began, drawn from contemporary records (the Bow Court records) with a good job done even in small details. The series is worth watching more than once not only for pleasure, but to catch some of the subtleties.

Ian McDiarmid is older than the Fielding he plays, who died at 47, but he really captures the spirit of the man so well, his humour and his rough tongue, his passion and that awful gout - it could hardly be better! Even the way he guzzles rather than sipping his wine - Fielding could take down 3 bottles of port in an evening - with almost palpable pleasure. I feel John is also played quite well by Iain Glen, with a very haunting and really quite creepy questioning of a gang member in one of the latter episodes.  This includes portraying the struggles the brothers first had working together until they could come to an understanding and a system - in his early 30s at this time, John was an ex-military man (he had had his eyes injured at 19 in the Navy, and later went blind by the 'ministrations' of a supposed noted London eye surgeon. He didn't have a barrister brother for nothing; Henry sued for 400-500); and like his brother, brilliant, if less wild. Although John looked up to and admired Henry, and Henry loved ""dear Jack"", their distinct and at times contradictory personalities were bound to clash under the constant pressure.

This is styled as a police drama - it is in a way a fictionalized account of a factual occurrence, based on solid historical research with the Fielding brothers working as detectives; something which, as noted in Hue and Cry (Patrick Pringle) actually did happen. In fact, John Fielding was a predecessor of Sherlock Holmes in implementing deductive reasoning in investigation.  Henry did similarly in his close questioning and investigation, with subsequent recording, of various cases. Very unfortunately, much was lost when the Lord Gordon rioters torched Sir John Fielding's house in the 1780s, burning many of Henry Fielding's papers and notes, so in fact it is very difficult to recreate the exact methods of detection and interrogation.

The molly houses, the taverns, the dirt, the foul language and, yes, the mores, are all here and distinctly 18th century. I have only two bones to pick with the production - one is WHERE IS SEASON 2?? The other is, that leonine mane of hair John Fielding sported was not a wig - it was his own hair.

Notes to US viewers:
1.  This is not a dramatization of the excellent Sir John Fielding novels. It is the story of the inception of the Bow Street Runners.
2.  This is not a Hollywood production.",1246060800,18,4222,4.748976807639837

3379456,4,B0015I2SMY,"TV series City of Vice has a great true-life pitch - the efforts of brothers Henry and John Fielding (the author of Tom Jones and a celebrated blind magistrate, played by Ian McDiarmid and Iain Glen respectively) to form England's first police force amid the squalor and near-apocalyptic lawlessness of a London already bursting at the seams in 1753. With the massive growth of cities (especially London) and a nationwide addiction to gin that makes modern problems with drugs look almost quaint, the 17-18th century was perhaps the most violent era in British history (though, despite dealing with murder, child prostitution, rape and sundry perversions, the series is not nearly so violent), yet the brothers still faced hostility from an aristocracy who could afford private protection to what they saw as an instrument of tyranny more suited to foreigners than free Englishmen. While the show sometimes downplays the casual violence, the brothers' morality, though seen from a 20th century perspective, is distinctly 18th century - they are not above ruining the odd reputation or contriving a robbery on a recalcitrant would-be patron to secure the Bow Street Runners' future. Nor does it turn them into glowing examples of police work. They're an almost fumbling band of detectives - as the first in their field, they're unsure even of how to investigate a murder (""How is it done?"" ""Ask questions?"") - and often they uphold the principle of the law with disastrous consequences to the victims of crimes.

The series too feels like it's still feeling its way along and doesn't always have the full confidence of its backers at Channel 4 - the metropolis a little underpopulated at times, the budgetary limitations apparent in the less-than-bustling streets and the nighttime hangings that fail to hide the lack of crowds. Yet often it manages to paper over the cracks with surprising style, using animated street maps of London to link scenes and adding scaffolding to sets they can't afford to build in their entirety to give an impression of a city at once sprouting up and falling down (literally in one scene of a slum collapsing, tenants and all). It's convincingly foul mouthed (""The Devil **** you, Mr Fielding!"" is one of the more minor terms of abuse), with McDiarmid deserving special praise for his tireless efforts to restore the word `****ster' to the common modern-day vocabulary. Despite the grim material it's not without moments of wit - Henry's wife, a former maid, cannot help herself from doing the housework - and if it's at times overly reliant on narration to fill the audience in on details, at least it's genuinely informative. The formidable John Fielding's abilities sometimes tend to get short shrift - he tends to get typed as the stern, unyielding one - and some of the guest stars are surprisingly awkward - Juliet Aubrey's strange inflection and Gary Lewis' often inaudible insular distemperate delivery make the lack of subtitles particularly problematic, but despite its problems the six episodes are compelling and intriguing enough to leave you hoping for a more fully realised second series.",1241740800,6,3134,5.073643410852713

Some heavy accents,  poor audio pick-up and constant background sound effects combined to make the dialog unintelligible about 30% of the time.

3379458,5,B0015I2SMY,"I saw this series elsewhere and just had to add it to my collection.  What this series managed to do was show the grubbiness and violence of the early 18th century and offer entertaining stories of the birth of English policing.

It certainly helps to know a little bit of both 1) the situation in London prior to the Fielding brothers and 2) the attitude of the English to the idea of a public police force.

In the years before this series was set the usual method of capturing criminals was to offer a reward.  This was done by both the state and private individuals.  Private individuals would then produce the criminals and/or the stolen goods in order to receive the reward. The upshot of this was the creation of a system where the people who caught the criminals were often hand in glove with the criminals.  The thief takers would also manufacture evidence against innocent individuals if the true criminal could not be found or would give him a sufficiently large bribe.  Jonathan Wilde,the self-styled ""Thief-taker General of England and Ireland"", was the most notorious of this fraternity.  He was hanged in 1725 for his more criminal activities.

As for the attitude of the English toward a public police force, they didn't want one.  An Englishman's home was his castle and he did not want to be forced to allow an outside force into his home.  This attitude is very clear in the first episode and the third.

So the proposed course the Fielding brothers took in trying to track down criminals was very forward thinking and done in the teeth of quite a bit of opposition.

I think the depiction of the London underworld was very realistic.  It's probably too gritty for the taste of some, and I admit to wincing at times, myself, but I could not fault the production for being anachronistic. There's brief but not gratuitous nudity.  The lighting appears natural.  A high quality television screen is needed to pick up the details.

I find the depiction of the homosexual life in London at the time very interesting.

Well produced, fairly believable  portrayal of the grime and degeneracy of a huge commercial corrupt city of London of yesteryear.  And a group of men who have just a touch of class, the nerve and the power to delve in, make a difference and solve crimes.",1518566400,,591,4.718446601941747

It does a lot to set the scene and tells you about the people of London at the time -- what's the famous quote?  Every civilization can be judged by how it treats its animals and prisoners.  So yeah, showing animal mistreatment is essential to setting the scene.  Again, spoiler -- they didn't really hurt the dog.",1514505600,,414,4.44
8258554,5,B0015I2SMY,"Life was not pretty and easy during the times this was to take place. You can see there is a difference of the noble class and the working class.  Sadly that is shown the double standards.  I found it interesting, as I am studing the history of the times.  Wish that there were more to watch.",1514505600,,292,4.178571428571429

8258556,5,B0015I2SMY,"Such a charming show.  Henry Fielding and John Fielding were real people but seem more like characters from a novel - a novelist policeman, a blind magistrate who can identify criminals by voice.  Despite many tragic scenarios, the show has a light touch while not shying away from the moral dilemmas and gray areas inherent in policing the desperately poor, in a time when homophobia and sexism were not problems to be fixed but the accepted norms.  Very much enjoying the show.",1513209600,,479,4.817073170731708
