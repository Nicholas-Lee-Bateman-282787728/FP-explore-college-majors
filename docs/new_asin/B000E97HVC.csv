2510273,1,B000E97HVC,"I knew this movie was going to be bad when I rented it, but I watch ALOT of bad horror movies, and besides, it had some accolades on the back, so I thought there was always a chance it could end up being a good way to spend an evening. What I discovered, however, was that this movie was so much more astronomically bad than I ever could have guessed in my wildest of dreams. It looks like an inexperienced and clueless high school students misguided attempts to use his weekends in a more productive way than his usual watching wrestling and getting stoned. Everything in this movie was just done so horribly. The camera work is terrible, the directing is without any kind of skill, the actors all look like friends from math class coaxed into reading from cue cards. The audio is SOOOO awful, and the editing is painfully amateurish. Lighting and sound is inconsistent from cut to cut, the dialogue is so bad you'll be grinding your teeth with every line. The plot is all so convoluted and ineffectively conveyed that I wondered if I had been punked when I rented this, and half expected Ashton Kutcher to be behind it all. All in all, I can't think of a single thing they did well in this movie. I am well aware that this was made by children, and that there are difficulties I'm sure they were able to conquer with commendable effort, but the end result is that there is just nothing here whatsoever that is worth watching, and there is no talent involved with this horrid mess. A second glance at the back cover will reveal that BOTH the positive comments are from the same place, something called ""The Meatgrinder."" I've never heard of ""The Meatgrinder,"" but I'm guessing that it's somehow involved with the making or distribution of this movie. I just cannot and will not accept that anyone's honest opinion of this chore to watch was that it was good. It's so bad that it transcends opinion, it's poor quality is an unshakable fact. It's not even ""MST3K it with your buddies"" bad, because we tried. It's just awful to watch.",1148342400,4,2032,4.524456521739131
2510274,2,B000E97HVC,"Camp Slaugher a.k.a Camp Daze directed by Alex Pucci is a low-budget modern homage to the days of 80's camp slasher films. The film begins with your typical camp scene from the 1980's. The counselors strumming his guitar, the kids are singing and the marshmellows are roasting. Everything seems just radical until murder and mayhem breaks loose among the campers! Cut to 2005. Four twenty some things are driving along and get lost after taking a shortcut (sound familiar?). Suddenly day becomes night and strange some things are happening all around the vehicle. They hear screams, see darting images, and blood and dirt are gradually covering the car. They fall asleep and awaken to a bright and sunny day in a time warp right back to 1980's. The four guests are shown around by a group of colorful campers and counselors.

They swim, they eat, they mention the Internet and get an array of blank stares. They wonder where their car is and why the hell the tow truck isn't coming along. They soon discover as night falls upon them that this camp has been stuck reliving the same night for 24 years after a massacre that took place in 1981. The counselors beg them for their help. Despite it's low budget, I did enjoy the movie and it kept my interest. The death scenes were very reminiscent to the Friday the 13th series, and Jason was of course mentioned throughout the film. During the movie there are very few sound effects which makes it difficult to really get into the action and gore. The DVD transfer is very poor and the images are stretched out and slightly distorted.

The special effects weren't done well, the blood was too red, the latex was clearly visible, and if you ever decide to do a hanging scene make sure you're not showing the separate rope around the guys waist that's being used to hoist him off his feet. The acting was decent. There was some great comic relief by Anika C. McFall who's bad ass attitude made me feel like I was watching an episode of The Berni Mac Show but with more profanity. I recognized Kyle Lupo right away from Devin Hamilton's film BIRTH RITE, and he is a very promising young actor who's appeared on a few other low budget flicks and the t.v. show WILDFIRE. Overall, I felt this movie was a good attempt at bringing us back to classics although I don't think it quite got there. Maybe next time.",1146182400,3,2349,4.563981042654029
2510275,1,B000E97HVC,"""The slasher film of the new millenium"" my a$$! ""The coolest retro camp killer since Sean Cunningham's(Friday the 13th)reinvented the genre"" ?WHAT?  Horror movie fans BEWARE! DO NOT BE FOOLED!(like i was) & this come's from a huge fan of ultra low-budget horror films such as ""REDNECK ZOMBIES"" ""FEAR OF CLOWNS"" ""DEAD LIFE"" ""SCRAP BOOK"" & the masterful ""ICE FROM THE SUN"". Horror fans Alex Pucci's ""CAMP SLAUGHTER(aka:camp daze)"" is a pure waist of $$$ & time! How this film won awards absolutely puzzles me to no end. The only thing good about this film is the (groundhogs day idea) everything else fails miserably! I'd take up way to much space explaining all the ridiculous flaws so to sum it up EVERYTHING $UCKED from the camera work,Direction,kills(every other victim gets stabbed with a spear,how creative is that),the sound was horrible & last but certainly not the least the acting was nauseating,i mean it made the acting in ""REDNECK ZOMBIES"" & ""DEAD LIFE"" seem oscar worthy. With all that said I'm still the SUCKER that waisted 94 minutes & 20$ on this very good idea that completely fails to materialize. So let me be your guinea pig (the test faild) horror fans please don't bother with this one it will be a big mistake!",1145836800,2,1232,4.784037558685446
2510276,3,B000E97HVC,"So, let's start with comparisons to Friday the 13th--some a direct rip-off of the film that so obviously inspired this one:

--film opens with a full moon

--counselors singing

--lurker walks through dark cabin while kids are asleep

--1st kill: cam freezes on girl's face; screen goes white

--opening credits: logo comes at screen, breaks glass

--opening credits: director credit comes at screen; screen goes white

--""The Present"" appears at bottom of screen in next scene

--kill: strap around head, tightened with wooden stick.  Direct rip from F13: A New Beginning

--2 folks speared to bed with pitchfork.  General rip from F13P2

--in flashback, boy drowns while counselor sleeps nearby

Ok, ok, I'm a dork, but F13 is my favorite horror flick.  I know that the writer/director of Camp Slaughter (aka Camp Daze)was intending an homage to F13, but some scenes in the film step over that line to blatant copying.  Other than that, it's a fair horror flick given the low budget and mediocre--if sometimes atrocious--acting.  Great early-1980s look.  The premise is decent, but I wish a little more care had been put into the execution.",1145836800,4,1142,5.021390374331551
2510277,5,B000E97HVC,"This film had me dying of laughter on the floor, don't get me wrong it did have good scary scenes and the death scenes are great. People you need to get this movie.",1174694400,4,164,4.0
2510278,3,B000E97HVC,This is an interesting movie that keeps you guessing until the end.. Its too bad the handsome Vade swears so much.. and that he had to die.. He looks like Josh Hartnet,1168128000,2,167,4.25
2510279,5,B000E97HVC,"YES, this movie is cheesy, but it's supposed to be! I totally loved it...but I also loved Sleepaway Camp! It's too funny to really worry about ""why"" they repeat the same day over and over!!! If your really anal about poor transitions and bad sound effects, you'll hate it, but it's a spoof of cheesy 80s horror movies, and the Groundhog Day effect gives it a unique twist that I've never seen done in a horror film before!

Sleepaway Camp meets Groundhog Day!!!

Mmmmwwwaaahahaha!!!",1167868800,7,482,4.726190476190476
2510280,2,B000E97HVC,"I was very disappointed with this movie and I love B horror flicks. I thought this was a rip off rendition of Friday the 13th. It is held in a summer camp, come on, with teenagers that scream, please. The idea of the plot was a good one, but executed very wrong. If you want to see a summer camp movie, see Friday the 13th series.",1164585600,3,330,4.015151515151516
2510281,1,B000E97HVC,"Some horror movies are so bad the audience laughs.  Others are so bad the audience can do naught but stare, slack jawed and with glazed over eyes, wondering what the producers and director were smoking to make them think this movie would be a good idea.  Then there is the third category, which Camp Slaughter falls firmly into, that are so bad one might wonder if there is some sort of bizarre plot to resurrect a long forgotten dark deity of death and despair by getting enough people to watch something as horrible as this.  Other than to wearily discuss the whole train wreck with your coworkers the next day around the water cooler, there is literally no entertainment value whatsoever to be derived from Camp Slaughter.

Apparently this is supposed to be a tribute to the whodunit style of teen slasher films of years long gone.  How something can be labeled a tribute, when it is worse than every single teen slasher movie put together, is a question that should be put to Alex Pucci, who directed the whole gods-forsaken mess.  Savvy horror movie buyers will notice there are actually film festival awards listed on the back of the DVD case, indicating the movie was actually praised by an independent panel of judges, leading many to believe the film might be worth buying.  After viewing Camp Slaughter, it will become painfully obvious that either the film festivals referenced don't exist, or Pucci himself oversaw them.

None of this criticism is intended in any way to discourage Pucci and co from doing any future films.  After all, you've gotta crawl before you can run.  Camp Slaughter just happened to not even be out of the womb yet.  It's clear that this was intended to be a great slasher flick, and that a lot of work went into it, it's just that every single facet of the movie failed on a level never seen before.  The word ""acting"" can't even be used in reference to camp slaughter, it's really more like a bunch of young kids goofing off in front of a camera.  Almost every scene of the movie is an extreme close up of someone's face.  Add to this the fact that when the camera cuts from one extreme close up to another of people who are supposedly in the same scene talking to each other, the time of day and sounds in the background obviously change, it becomes apparent that the director couldn't even get all of the cast to show up at the same place at the same time for shooting.  Anytime some sort of assumed action is occurring, the camera switches to comical warp speed reminiscent of ultra low budget TV shows to try to hide the fact that nothing is actually happening.

The standard elements of a slasher style horror movie are all used throughout the script, but they all inevitably fail, each more spectacularly bad than the last.  It all starts by the number, with a group of teens driving down an empty expanse of the Great American Highway System.  Of course, the vehicle breaks down at an inopportune time leaving the teens stranded in strange surroundings.  The intrepid travelers soon discover there is a killer amongst them (but who?), there's a lot of unnecessary dialogue and explaining of why the killing is happening, and then finally the whole thing ends with the ""oh no the terror isn't really over"" ending that should have been dumped with the Friday the 13th series.  To discuss the specifics of what is going on in this particular slasher entry would be to lend some sort of legitimacy to the plot, which anyone who enjoys horror movies should staunchly refuse to do.

Maybe with an expanded budget, some actors who have at least a modicum of talent, a script that doesn't lead viewers to randomly commit suicide, and a little more experience under their belts, the criminals responsible for Camp Slaughter will give us something that fits in the ""so bad it's funny"" category.  In the meantime, don't be surprised if Cthulhu rises from his watery sleep to rest control of the earth from the gods of light once again.",1162598400,3,3970,4.633380884450784
2510282,1,B000E97HVC,"Ummmmm...... Let's see. This has to be the worst movie ever concieved. It's also the worst movie born, raised, and graduated to DVD ever. EVER. This movie makes ginsu knife infomercials look like Academy award material. DO NOT WATCH, ESPECIALLY DON'T SPEND 24 DOLLARS ON IT!!! The guy who wrote this owes me that hour and fifteen minutes of my life. I put more effort in writing this review then they did making this horrible movie. Ugh...",1155254400,,439,4.714285714285714
2510283,1,B000E97HVC,"I have def. seen worse but why did the director pick an insipid concept for a movie? Camp counsellors trapped in August of 1981 with slayings of innocent teenagers being repeated. Wow, that's really innovative. The black chick's dialogue was the only reasonable excuse for me watching the rest of the movie. **** SPOILER ***** And it turned out she was the only one who survived!",1151107200,2,379,4.757575757575758
2510284,2,B000E97HVC,"Well the original title of this film was Camp Daze and it was changed to Camp Slaughter I guess to make is sound more attractive.  I supposed I would agree with that.  Camp Daze makes it sound like one of those 80's teen sex & drug comedies instead of a horror film.  The title may be about the best thing is in this lame, technically horrible, piece of junk.  The plot is just weird enough that it will raise and eyebrow and make you think that it sounds pretty interesting.  But then the execution turns out to be just lousy, less than amateur skill level.

Anyway a group of young-somethings are traveling along through a remote forest road when they break down.  They eventually come upon Camp Hiawatha, and find themselves somehow transported back in time to 1981, and the night when a killer went out a rampage killing the teenaged campers.  Somehow this group has got to free the kids from this curse and rescue them while trying to stay alive themselves.  It's kind of like that movie ""Frequency"" meets ""Friday the 13th"".  I guess the filmmakers were trying to do a bit of a tribute to those slasher films of the 1980's but I guess my question is, why not just do a good slasher film in the 80's tradition without the convoluted time traveling plot?

Beyond that the movie is just so technically inferior.  I understand low budget and all but come on....the sound was just awful, the camera work was terrible, the lighting was poor, and the acting was strictly high school dram club, particularly with the female cast members who were all in their very first screen credit.  You know that's a problem.  The one positive is that it's pretty funny.  They go so over the top in trying to get the 80's look and feel that it comes off more as a spoof.  Not sure if they intended it that way or not but it was funny.",1149638400,6,1818,4.414414414414415
2510285,1,B000E97HVC,"It is difficult to label anything as the worst movie ever.  This movie comes so perilously close, though.

If you're like me, you'll disregard the reviews and try this movie anyway.  You will be very, very disappointed.

Sound = BAD.

Acting = BAD.

F/X = BAD.

Plot = BAD. (although it is a good idea)

Entertainment Value = None.

Redeeming qualities = One.  Watching the Behind the Scenes featurette and realizing that the director and the actors actually took this movie seriously.",1149465600,4,485,4.804878048780488
2510286,1,B000E97HVC,"It's supposed to be a tribute to the slasher films of the 80's. Granted the genre has never set out to do anything intelligent, but this film brings the idea to an all new low. The premise seemed promising enough. They're all stuck living the same horrific day over again. (Why? How? We don't know) The problem is that they're aware of the fact. So why are they repeating the same things over as if they don't know? Sure they say that they're limited in what they can do, but that obviously doesn't include talking about it. In long lecture like bits of dialogue, I might add. It just doesn't add up at all. If only there was some more camp in this camp then it might be good on the Cheese Whiz scale, but it just comes off as pathetic. The worst part of it is the editing. In so many scenes someone starts to attack, then they cut away; typical of low budget horror. Some times you cut to an angle where you just see a silhouette hacking or something, as you'd expect. Unfortunately, most times though they cut to a shot where it's already happened. They skip over the kill entirely. The sound isn't much better. So many times the sound just cuts out too. Usually, durning scenes where a better movie would have dubbed in a sound effect. An arrow hits a body, silence. A body falls, silence. Did they run out of money, or did they just forget? In short, it's an amateurish film made by no talent hacks who need to find a day job.",1148774400,3,1430,4.280442804428044

8107490,3,B000E97HVC,"Okay, Im going to admit first off, that the only reason I got this movie in the first place was because of Matt Dallas being in it. I was a big fan of Kyle XY and wanted to see some of his other work. Well he definitely came a long way after this movie. This movie is by no means great or extremely entertaining. But if you're looking for a goofy, non-acting, friday the 13th rip-off, with a bland Sixth Sense feel thrown in, then this is the movie to watch. It's definitely extremely evident that it is a VERY cheap production. But as an aspiring filmmaker myself I can't knock the producers and everyone for trying to make a movie. Everybody's visions are different when it comes to these things. This however probably needed just a little more tweaking before they decided to move forward. But it is what it is.",1360281600,,814,4.3618421052631575

8107494,3,B000E97HVC,"Okay, I know I'm in the minority here, but I honestly didn't think the movie was that bad. Maybe I just had low expectations. Don't get me wrong. This is definitely not the best movie ever, but I don't think it is the worst either. Yes, the acting is amateurish and some of the camera work is awful, but I thought the overall story line was interesting and some of the death scenes were cleverly staged. It reminded me a lot of some of David DeCouteau's films with its subtle (and not so subtle) hints of homosexuality and gratuitious shirtless guys.

I felt like i was watching fledgling student actors improv about 95% of the movie. The death scenes were completely uninventive and unexciting. The plot could have been really cool, but the directing, production, cinematography and acting were all sooooooooooooooooooo bad that there was no saving this disaster of a movie. I also want to state how shocked I was at the camera work and overall movie ""QUALITY""...because this movie looked like it was filmed on a 500 dollar camcorder. Not even SLIGHTLY scary, and incredibly boring. Don't waste your time on this trash. It's definetly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

8107496,4,B000E97HVC,"Camp Slaughter (Alex Pucci, 2005)

Camp Slaughter (aka Camp Daze) is the first real out-and-out slasher flick that isn't part of a series in well over a decade. And not to put too fine a point on it, it may well be the best slasher flick that hasn't been part of a series since the original Friday the 13th; it's certainly the best slasher-flick spoof to come down the pike since 1981's Student Bodies. That said, the market for this movie is going to be those of us who were teens in the eighties and couldn't get enough of low-budget godawful slasher films; everyone else will probably wonder what all the fuss is about. If you're one of us, though, you're going to love this.

The plot: four modern-day young-and-beautifuls get lost in the Maine woods. While spending the night in their car, they witness a slasher killing someone. The next morning, the body is gone, and they find themselves embraced by the rather retro members of Camp Hiawatha, which was probably a scary enough place back in the eighties. They're soon told the reason everyone looks so weird: it's because camp Hiawatha is under a curse, reliving over and over the events that took place when a killer eviscerated the place (if you'll pardon the pun) in August 1981. The counselors know what's happening, and they believe the young-and-beautifuls, being outsiders who have wandered into the repetitive scene, may be able to break the camp out and finally put the souls to rest.

This is great stuff-- though, like I said, you already have to be a fan of the genre to get a lot of the in-jokes. It's what Scream might have been had that film not tried to take its postmodern angle so seriously; good, stupid fun where you, as the viewer, know the filmmakers are laughing with you, not at you, but (unlike the similarly brilliant Club Dread) stays enough on the horror side of the fence that the laughs are uncomfortable more than once. Camp Slaughter walks a balance, and does it well. More than that, buried under the deconstruction of the slasher film mores, there's a brain here. You may have to dig to get to it sometimes, but it's well worth the effort. *** ",1184716800,6,2136,4.5984251968503935
