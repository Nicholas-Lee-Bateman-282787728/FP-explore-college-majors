4830088,5,B005LS4MNW,"We bought this because we love Peter Dinklage in Game of Thrones and thought it would be a kick to see it in 3D.  This is a superbly acted, gumshoe-like mystery with fantastic comedic twists.  We know we are going to watch it again because there will be things we missed.  Really enjoyable film.",1345766400,4,295,4.425925925925926
4830089,5,B005LS4MNW,"Loved the movie. Mark Boone Junior is excellent as usual, and paired with Peter Dinklage, what a combination. Movie arrived early, which was great. Was in perfect condition, and played with no problems at all. I would certainly buy from this company again. I have been waiting for this movie to become available, and was thrilled I could get it so quickly. Thank you.",1332547200,,367,4.75
4830090,2,B005LS4MNW,This movie had all the right actors but it was still not good.  It was missing elements.  It wasn't compelling and the ending was blah.,1325203200,,135,4.36
4830091,4,B005LS4MNW,"I heard that this movie was in production a while ago, checked back in on it a few times, then forgot.  Then to my surprise saw it in a friends DVD collection today and gave it a watch.

Pretty surreal at times, sort of attention grabbing. Theres some really interesting characters, the ending is sort of cliche, but all in all worth the hour and a half of my life spent watching it.

Probably going to watch it again later (and I don't do that often) but yeah, the characters could have had a little more development. Usually I love Steve Buscemi, but I wasn't really that into him in this flick.  Hes not a main character though, so I guess he did a great job in not being too attention grabbing.

Couple absurd moments, feel good ending, will probably buy this DVD and nag others to watch it.",1325116800,5,795,4.308724832214765

8478479,1,B005LS4MNW,"Decided to buy it because Peter Dinklage was in it and enjoy his performance in Game Of Thrones.
Should have skipped this movie.  Not the best story.",1441584000,,149,4.518518518518518
8478480,4,B005LS4MNW,A wacky dramedy.,1415923200,,16,4.666666666666667
8478481,1,B005LS4MNW,"I used to say that I had never seen a movie with Steve Buscemi in it that I didn't like. Alas, that statement is no longer true. I love Peter Dinklage, too, but even he couldn't help rescue this mess.",1409097600,,200,4.025
8478482,3,B005LS4MNW,"Hard to follow the plot until about the middle of the movie.  Not sure I will watch it again.  Tim Roth at his crazy best, but he doesn't show up much until towards the end.",1398470400,,173,3.914285714285714
8478483,4,B005LS4MNW,"I liked it buy it's not for everyone. I like the characters, especially Boone Jr. Its not the Big Lebowski by no means, but it has some great moments.",1383004800,,150,4.206896551724138
8478484,5,B005LS4MNW,"Had to watch it a few times to understand everything going on, but I really liked it. It's quirky and fun. Sort of a fear and loathing without the excessive drug use. Love the cast!",1379635200,,181,4.2
8478485,3,B005LS4MNW,For the cast involved I was surprised that this is such a strange movie.  Not enough Tim Roth for me.  Not a movie I'd watch over and over.,1361664000,,139,3.9285714285714284
8478486,2,B005LS4MNW,"I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie not saying others might not like it. It just wasn't that type of dark comedie I get into personally. I bought this film for 2 reasons really.

1. The 3D. I'm a big 3D nut and if you look at some of my other  reviews you will probably be able to tell that and you would also notice I will try to find some thing positive in most 3D movies but this one is very flat. I had better effects playing it in 2D and using my 3DTV to convert it for me. Yeah the 3D was that bad. I'm pretty sure this is one of these movies like loser,2:22,the job and others where they are over seas movie with very little to no effort and making it a 3D movie. If you are looking to add to your 3d collection you will be disappointed i'm afraid.

2. Was for the actors, I mean you got the Dink man from game of thrones, Tim Roth from reservoir dogs and steve bushem( i am not even gonna pretend i can spell his last name..hahaha) But the main guy from Board walk empire(which is an awesome show if you have a chance) Any way I'm not going to get into the story cause I'm sure you have read up on the movie already. The acting wasn't bad by any means it was just a story I couldn't really get into and I wanted too. Like I said it wasn't a bad movie just not my type. I would give the movie 3 stars maybe but due to the fact they slapped a 3D label on this (and you will feel robbed if you buy this movie for it's 3d) I cant give it more than 2 stars over all. I figured 3 stars for the movie, 1 star for the 3d.

I hope this helps others in there purchase.",1346284800,,1568,3.8153846153846156
