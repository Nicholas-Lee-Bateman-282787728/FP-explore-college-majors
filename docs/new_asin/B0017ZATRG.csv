8601568,5,B0017ZATRG,"This documentary covers several attractions in Vegas that are completely different from each other.
It is really neat to get a behind the scenes look at some things that I have enjoyed for years.
I understand that the EFX show that is featured in this film has now closed which is too bad because it looks like it was a really cool show.  Makes we want to plan another trip there.",1359763200,,380,4.352112676056338
8601569,1,B0017ZATRG,"FOUND IT DISAPPOINTING IN TERMS OF CONTENT.  PICTURE QUALITY NOT GOOD ENOUGH.  SOME PARTS WERE REALLY TOO LONG & DRAGGY ESPECIALLY THE SCENES FEATURING THE SPECIAL WINE RETRIEVAL ROOM IN ONE RESTAURANT IN VEGAS.  REGRETTED PURCHASING IT AS IT WAS REALLY BELOW MY EXPECTATIONS OF WANTING TO WATCH ALL THE POPULAR VEGAS ATTRACTIONS ON DVD. IT DID NOT EVEN FEATURE MOST OF THE FANTASTIC & AMAZING ATTRACTIONS THAT LAS VEGAS IS FAMOUS FOR.
KINDLY ALSO NOTE THAT MY RECENT PURCHASES OF ""KISS OF THE DRAGON"" BLURAY AND ""MICHAEL JACKSON LIVE IN BUCHAREST"" DVD WERE ALSO VERY DISAPPOINTING AS THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS ONLY AS GOOD AS A VCD!  THAT IS, IT WAS NOT EVEN DVD QUALITY ESPECIALLY THE ""MICHAEL JACKSON LIVE IN BUCHAREST"" DVD WHICH WAS REALLY POOR QUALITY.  I DON'T EXPECT A REFUND BUT AS I'M A REGULAR & LOYAL AMAZON CUSTOMER, IF POSSIBLE, AMAZON MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER MY REQUEST OF GIVING ME A REASONABLE SPECIAL DISCOUNT ON MY NEXT PURCHASE. I HOPE AMAZON WILL TAKE MY COMMENTS AS POSITIVE, HONEST & CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK. PLEASE CONSIDER MY REQUEST. PLEASE NOTE IT'S ONLY A REQUEST... I'M NOT INSISTING ON THE DISCOUNT.
LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR POSITIVE & PROMPT REPLY.
