8051993,3,B0007UVXH2,"Amazon really needs to add a description for this. This is a Story Store tale described as follows: ""When George sends Pip to Granny Clump with a special delivery from The Story Store, he mixes up the packets with disastrous results. Poor Pip is so upset by the havoc he has caused, that he sets off alone into the wide world and George has to search in the howling storm for his gloomy little chum.""

The package contains a 32 page book and two bonus episodes -- Double Trouble and You Must Remember This. Running time is 30 minutes and is rated Ages 5 and up.

Gave it three stars as I'm sure it's a good thing for kids, but didn't know what rating to actually give it. Since I THOUGHT I was buying the Andy Dick Christmas movie, I was more than a little disappointed. I'm sure my nephew will love it, though.

This review is provided so that you don't buy the wrong movie by accident. Happy holidays!",1324425600,2,903,4.3
8051994,2,B0007UVXH2,I also thought it was the movie with Andy Dick but it turned out to be an animated movie. Not even a Christmas movie.  Oh well my granddaughter likes it.,1133740800,,153,4.1
