It seems films were also slower in 1971.  I understand pacing a film to mimic waves coming & going on the shore, but that doesn't work for this film

Three 15 years oldish teenage boys spend their summer of 1942 doing just about anything to keep from getting bored.

15 years old Hermie becomes infatuated with an older woman married to a soldier who leaves on the island while he fights in WWII

Hermie's friend Oscy meets a girl his age to find out what sex is

This was my favourite movie when I was a teenager - and unlike so many I have re-watched in my adulthood, this movie has stood the test of the time.
The beauty, the romance, the realism - it is all just as wonderful as the first 15 times I saw it.
The characters were exactly as I remembered, the dialogue and the theme - omg, that theme!
I consider this movie ""one of the greats"" because it has everything: the writing, sets, costumes, casting (so perfectly cast).
It could have been maudlin, smutty, over the top - but it wasn't. Oscy could have been an a--; Benjie a total nerd, and they could've (as is done so frequently now) thrown in some T&A..
 They didn't - and the restraint just magnified the beauty.
Each one of these characters, from main to the supporting cast, is memorable and each one brought something to make this movie all that it is...",1490572800,2,897,4.339285714285714
296895,5,6300268128,"Summer of '42 has long been considered a classic among coming-of-age stories. Filmed in 1971 as a low-budget pot boiler, the story was later turned into a best selling book in a short three weeks of writing by the original screen writer, Herman Raucher. The movie was the 6th highest grossing film of 1971 and one of the most successful films in history.

The story is based on actual events. I won't spoil the story for viewers or readers who haven't experienced it before.  But I can promise that young men (and no few older men) will find themselves recalling and perhaps even feeling their own intense embarrassments as adolescents, ignorant of their own sexuality but fascinated by the prospect of getting laid while at the same time fearful of ""messing up"".  The core of the story is the stuff of legend and wishful thinking -- an uncertain teenager (Hermie) led to his sexual awakening by an older and strikingly beautiful woman (Dorothy). Their shared night unfolds in moments that might comprise either very poor adult judgment on her part, or a profound kind of sensual charity and caring that molds him for the rest of his life.  Or both.

The movie is ""carried"" by the performances of Jennifer O'Neill and Gary Grimes, backed by the moody musical score of Michel Legrand.  It is done without nudity, but with such an artfully nuanced sensuality that one may be uncertain of exactly what has happened -- as indeed Hermie himself will be for years to follow.",1488844800,13,1468,4.737254901960784

Summer of '42 is a beautiful, poignant, funny & bittersweet coming-of-age story about growing up and learning a priceless lesson of tenderness and caring so deeply for someone that it changes you for the rest of your life.

The acting, direction, cinematography, editing, music & other production values are flawless. It's about as close to being a perfect movie as possible. No wonder it was nominated for 4 Academy Awards.

Jennifer O'Neill clearly understood the role & played it with effortless grace. Grimes likewise couldn't be better as the protagonist/storyteller. Houser & Conant are also pitch-perfect. Even the minor characters are outstanding. But it's LeGrand's haunting, unforgettable score that won the Oscar for best music and became one of the most recorded songs ever.

Summer of '42 was a huge box office hit & has become a timeless classic, And amazingly, it was all done without guns, car chases, explosions, kung-fu or CGI digital FX! Today's filmmakers could stand to learn from it.

One interesting note is that although the story takes place on the Atlantic coast, it was actually shot on the Pacific coast in a tiny beach town in Oregon, which is now a mass of condos & million-dollar vacation homes.",1475798400,2,1396,4.9742489270386265

297045,4,6300268128,"I suppose each generation goes through its coming of age period somewhat differently, coming of age meaning in beginning the treacherous process of understanding all the sexual changes and commotions once you pass puberty somewhat differently. Take the one I know about personally of coming of age in the early 1960s in the age of the Pill, of technology-driven space exploration and of some new as yet unspoken and undiscovered social breeze coming to shake up a lot of the old values, to turn the world upside down, from our parents generation. Take too the one before mine, the one represented in this film under review Summer of 1942 about the coming of age in our parents generation. The generation that on one edge, the older edge went through the whole trauma of the Great Depression that brought barren days to the land and of slogging World War II and at the other edge, the younger edge, missing the trauma of war and its particular stamp on those who survived went on to form the alienated youth who turned beat, rode homespun hot rods to perdition, grabbed a La Jolla perfect wave surf board, revved up hellish motorcycles to scare all the squares and come under the immediate spell of jailbreak rock and roll. Here is the funny thing at least on the basis of a viewing of this film on the question of dealing with sex, sexual knowledge and experiences there was a very familiar (and funny) sense that our parents who, at least in my case and the case of my growing up friends, went through the same hoops-with about the same sense of forlorn misunderstanding.

Heres how it played out in this film which was originally released in 1971 although the at least the two generations after mine might also recognize some of the danger signs, pitfalls and funny stuff that went on in this film around sexually coming of age in this wicked old world. The story line is based on the essentially true-to-life experiences of a Hollywood screen-writer Hermie Raucher (played by Gary Grimes), coming of age 15, and his two companions, gregarious Oscy and studious Benji, who were slumming in the year 1942 at the beautiful but desolate end of an island retreat in the first summer of the American direct involvement in the Pacific and European wars after the Japanese bombings of Pearl Harbor. (The island Nantucket Island in the book but filmed off desolate Mendocino in California in the film). They like a million other virginal boys of that age during war or peacetime were driven each in their own way by the notion of sexual experimentation and conquest and so the chase was on.

That chase was on at two levels. The rather pedestrian one of seeking out young girls of their own age to see what shook out of the sexual tree and Hermies almost mystical search for meaningful love in the person of an older woman, Dorothy, played by Jennifer ONeil, who had been a young war bride staying on the island after her husband headed off to war. The own age part, funny in parts, driven mostly by pal Oscys overweening desire to get laid with a blonde temptress whom he finally got his wish with on night at the secluded end of the beach with his most experienced partner. On that occasion Hermie was shut out of any desire he had to do the same with her friend who was as bewildered by sex as he was. The older woman (in our circles a cradle-robbing older woman although she was only 22) notion of love is what drove him the moment he has set eyes on her when the trio was spaying on her and her husband so he was saving himself for her. And after a series innocent (and some goofy) encounters with Dorothy one night, after she has just found out that her husband had been killed in the war, she bedded him (there is no other honest way to put the matter). That was that though, for when Hermie subsequently went back to the cottage she had left the island and left him a more solemn young man.

Those are the main lines that get played out but what makes this one more than of ordinary interest to me was the whole lead-up, the whole foreplay if you will to be doing something about getting out of that dreaded virgin status (and avoid the designation homo, among heterosexual youth the bane of every corner boy guy coming up in that and the next generation). There was the very familiar inevitable (and frustrating)feeling up of the girl scene at the movies of which neighborhood legends are made (although Hermie missed the mark, literally, on that one), the awkward scene where Hermie was helping Dorothy with storing some packages and he got sexually excited by her off-hand helping hand touch, the scene where the three friends discover what sexual intercourse is all about through the good graces of Benjis mothers medical books (unlike most of the rest of us learned what we learned about sex in the streets, and not always correct information either), and of course the fumbling by the numbers (off-screen) when Oscy has his first sexual experience. The best scene of all though and it really showed the difference between then and now when the younger generations can grab condoms off the shelf at any drugstore or in some places right in schoolhouse restrooms (formerly lavs) and who might not quite appreciate enough the scene where Hermie tried to buy rubbers at the local village drugstore from the jaded disbelieving druggist. Yeah, watch this one and remember your own, either sex, torturous rumbling around coming to terms with sex.",1473552000,,5447,4.636645962732919

Mendocito, CA looks like a nice place but to anyone familiar with the Cape and Islands, the special atmosphere and the appearance of townscapes, houses, cottages, roads and beaches is totally off. Not to mention people's accents. I think it makes a big big difference. It couldn't be filmed there apparently because Nantucket had been too updated by 1971 to look like it did in 1942.

Jennifer O'Neill is perfect as Dorothy, the exquisite beauty (in looks and character), seemingly unattainable, for a 15-year-old to remember always as his first and greatest love. She conveys all the attributes of a fantasy figure: beauty, kindess, tenderness, understanding, and (ultimately) anguish, in understated expression. At the same time, Hermie (the youth) and his friends, hormones raging, are utterly believable. Funny, funny.

It's sad and poignant and funny and feel-good all at the same time and if you're seeing it for the first time I promise you'll never forget it. The same goes for the novel.

I guess the best way to describe it would be to steal a line from the novel about a note the author saved from the Summer of '42 and I'm paraphrasing here; ""when the world had punched him around too much he would take out the letter and re-read those words and everything would be all right.""

The movie is beautifully filmed with the Medicino, California area filling in for the New England island where the story is set.  The musical score is haunting and, I believe, won a deserved Oscar.  Garry Grimes does very well as the conflicted teen, Hermie, and Jennifer O'Neill is glowing as Dorothy, the object of every desire he has.

From a Christian viewpoint, it reflects the moral confusion found in a post-Eden culture. Many will come away from this movie with a sense of unresolved relativism.

297906,5,6300268128,"This movie is based on a true story. It happened on Nantucket Island off MA in '42, but was filmed in a colder climate in Fort Bragg, CA. The movie was written before the book. Herman never asked Dorothy's last name or age in real life. In the movie, the telegram lists her last name as Walker from Bangor, ME. Herman was traumatized by never seeing her after that one night. In real life, he was depressed and tried to date every girl named Dorothy he met. When the movie became famous, he received a letter from the real Dorothy, postmarked from Canton, Ohio. She said she remarried and hoped he was not too hurt from their affair. In real life, Dorothy was drunk that night and called Herman by her husband's name 'Pete' in bed. But the last words she ever spoke to him were in fact, ""Good night, Hermie."" In real life, she only sent him that one letter in 1972. No more. He regretted not hearing from her after that and still thought of her decades later. She ended her 1972 letter to him with this, ""The ghosts of that night 30 years ago are better left undisturbed."" The real song that played on her record player that night, if you want to recreate the mood, was 'That Old Feeling.'  The final line from that song foretold the future, ""There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start / 'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart."" She could not start something new yet, because her husband was still in her heart. Eerie, fitting. To her it was a drunken episode, I sense; to him, the world.

The theme song - a great sentimental mood piece - could make someone curious to see this movie, as could a desire to understand the decades before your birth that your parents knew well. It will surely remind you of your youth, hanging gout with friends, trying to meet and talk to girls, and overcoming the awkwardness of your first sexual experiences. Notice the camera work, as through the broken wooden fence at dusk, the faded wallpaper, suggesting a wallflower no more, and so on... The ending stands in stark contrast to today. Back then, people wandered out of your life. Nowadays, he would have her cell number and Facebook page...",1415664000,9,2150,4.4543147208121825

Forget that it is unrealistic that Dorothy, the most beautiful young woman that ever existed and who has just received a telegram that her recently departed young husband had been killed in action, gives herself to a 15-year old who has become totally enamored with her.  Hermie is the luckiest boy in the world to have had his initial sexual experience with this young woman.

The three 15-year old boys are a delight. Hermie's friend Oscy (Oscar, I presume) is the epitome of uninhibited, gregariousness. Benjie, the other boy, is a nerd, before there were nerds.  Just a meek, squirmy kid, but lovable.

The time, the innocence, the incredible culmination of a 15-year old boy's infatuation is enough to make an old guy like me want to retreat to 1942 and take Hermie's role.  Oh, if only.",1391299200,,874,4.748344370860927

Next night,  I brought up Amazon and searched ""Summer of '42"".  Voila, they had it also.  I played it hoping to fill in some of the blanks left from the VUWU showing.  What a difference.  Yes, it was in HD, much more vivid that the original in 1971, and it had an incorporated CC track so I didn't miss any of the soft spoken dialogue.  $2.99 also.

Jennifer O'Neill is a typical American beauty of the era.  Obviously the Director also had this thing for her from the wonderful shots emphasizing how pretty she is.  Perhaps that helps explains her 9 marriages.  Is being a 9.9 on a ten scale (more attractive than Bo Derek) a blessing or a curse?

The story is a poignant tale of a 15/16 year old teen coming of age.  Many of us will relate to those feelings of ambiguity of ""loving"" vs. ""respecting"" vs. ""using"" the girls we dated.  How immature our shallow friends were,  and unfortunately they were the source of most of our misinformation.

298130,5,6300268128,"As a dedicated movie buff & a very serious student of film Summer of 42 is (without a doubt) my all time favourite movie! Nothing I have ever seen since (or before) will ever come close to its magic & power.

I first saw it so many years ago when I was just 20, not much older than Hermie in the film. I remember the experience so well: a hot Saturday night in a large art house cinema in a suburb of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia. The movie house was fairly deserted that night & it felt like I was the only one in the theatre. On a huge screen the story unfolded & I was hooked from the beginning.

After it was over I remember going back to my car & just sitting there for about a half an hour, dwelling on the unique movie experience that had just totally consumed me. It really got to me on so many levels: the innocence & awkwardness of youth, the secret world of teenage boys that adults (especially parents) never understand, the awesome intoxication of that first crush.

And ... in my opinion the scene where Hermie goes into the drugstore to buy the condom is one of the sweetest & funniest scenes ever recorded on film.

I have lost count of how many times I have seen Summer of 42. I do know, however, if I watch it when ever I am happy, it makes me sad; if I watch it when ever I am sad, it makes me happy. Strange ... but true!

I run it regularly in my home movie theatre for friends to introduce them to its magic, but I never watch it with them. I only ever watch this movie alone. This is ""my movie""; I will share its wonder with others, but I can only ever watch it by myself. Again strange ... but true!

Gary Grimes who played Hermie left acting in the late 1970's. I found a recent article on him (now aged in his 50's). He has gone onto other pursuits & says that he is happy with the life choices he has made. Still ... he a great loss to film!

Mr Grimes, if you ever happen to read this re-view, thank you for your wonderful performance that was (is) at the heart of this movie's magic & wonder. Sir, I salute you!",1385683200,,2045,4.0721393034825875

Robert Mulligan had previously directed ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and had a gift for finding truthful moments where others might have delivered cliches.  Of course the story is contrived and sentimental, but it humanizes a very common experience that others might have sensationalized.  Today, of course the woman would be arrested as a predator, publicly humiliated by our modern Christo-nazis, and forced to live in the desert somewhere, so the film also remains a vestige of a time when people were perhaps a little more nuanced and human and understood the moral ambiguities that life enforces on our sensibilities.",1383696000,,708,4.983050847457627

298179,2,6300268128,"If one were to combine ""Somewhere in Time"" with ""American Pie"", the result might be something like ""Summer of '42"", a movie that tries to combine sentimentality with raunchy comedy and ultimately fails at both.

The late Roger Ebert (who disliked the film) correctly laments the many contradictions that weigh the film down:  the thoughts and feelings of a 14-year old boy being re-told and re-imagined by an adult narrator, the wistful ""days of old"" nostalgia contrasted with the sexual frankness of a much later time, the sudden restraint of the final, key ""love"" scene against the unrestrained crudeness of the earlier sex-and-rubbers exchanges, which clearly aim for easy laughs but seem to belong in a different movie.

The effect of these contradictions is to prevent us from ever really knowing the characters.  Dorothy disappears from the film just as she entered it: as a vision, an enigma, an object of feminine beauty.  As adults, we understand her intimacy with Hermie as a momentary emotional need in the face of grief, but did Hermie ever understand this?  We don't know.  And what becomes of the oafish Oscy, who seems destined for a life of destructive self-indulgence, sexual misadventures and emotional disconnection?

If there is a ""serious"" theme to Summer of '42 (and one that it fails to explore), it might be a cautionary tale of kids growing up too fast, of sexual preoccupations and adult losses intruding upon young minds ill-equipped to understand or interpret them.  Sadly, the movie never takes itself seriously enough to confront the questions it raises.  Instead of an honest and compelling film about loss of innocence and its after-effects, we get lots of pretty sunsets, evocative music, and a whimsical narrative about how things were different ""back then"".  For me, it all rings very hollow.",1377993600,,1827,5.056666666666667

298223,5,6300268128,"This movie really happened. It is based on the real life experience of Herman Raucher, who wrote the screenplay, and then the book, in that order. Raucher is ""Hermie"" in the movie, and this experience happened to him in the summer of 1942 at Nantucket Island, off Cape Cod. There was a real Dorothy, and he had a brief affair with her following the death of her young Army Air force husband. His friend Oscy was also real, and he died about 10 years later.

The movie, of course, was a huge hit, and made Jennifer O'Neill, who played Dorothy, a star. Michel Legrand's song, ""Summer me, Winter me"" also became a big hit.

After the movie was released in 1971, Raucher received a letter from the real Dorothy. She told him about her life after she left Nantucket, remarried, etc. with three grandchildren. She thanked him for filling a void at the time of her despair. Unlike the movie, she kept referring to him as her husband ""Pete"" the night they made love. The movie scene, when young Hermie finds the telegram and makes love to her in tears is one of the most moving I have ever seen--something you never forget.

298276,5,6300268128,"""In that particular summer Hermie was fifteen, wildly obsessed with sex, deeply and passionately in love with an ""older woman"" of twenty-two. SUMMER OF '42 is the story of Hermie and the lovely Dorothy, of Hermie's frantic efforts to become a man, and of his glorious and heartbreaking initiation into sex."" So goes the rear cover on Herman Raucher's autobiographical tale ""Summer Of '42"". This movie is Classic True Romantic Cinema, not merely ""a coming of age"" movie. It tells a true tale of a nave teenager and a sophisticated woman's inappropriate yet pure, innocent, accidental romance in an intelligent naturalistic style. Natural beauty Jennifer O'Neill as female lead, has had her character Dorothy described as ""a girl of almost magical loveliness and vulnerability"". Possessing an easy charm, she smites the awkward but disarming character Hermie (and us too). The movie's subtle humour is endearing, as when Dorothy and Hermie get to know one another and become friends, it's side-splitting. Their friendship goes on to be tested in many ways, until eventually when Dorothy's absent serviceman husband is killed in the war it raises the threat of potential disintegration and the loss of self image for them. But their affection, once casual, is by then strong and profound, and it spares them the worst.

The movie manages to remain gorgeously optimistic despite the challenges of the narrative, it retains its uncluttered easy listening environment. The locations look wonderful, particularly the beaches and surrounding areas and the authentic looking idealised '40's small town environment. And importantly, there's this movie's famous Michel LeGrand soundtrack. The movie and its soundtrack are so well paired as to be inseparable, in the same way as ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"" and ""A Man And A Woman"", exceptionally nostalgic movie and soundtrack pairings. The sublime incidental music is mostly variations of the Summer Of '42 theme, drenching the movie with heart wrenching atmosphere. (Incidentally, this music is only available only in the movie. The ""Summer Of '42"" cd disappointingly has only the opening and closing themes).

Both beautiful and achingly nostalgic, this is the sort of movie they can't make today - thankfully! Because if they did, it wouldn't be set in a '40's picturesque authentic small town - instead it would be set in a titular gothic circus with Hermie as a terrorist trick-unicyclist and Dorothy as a too-smart bipolar female undercover cop with a brain circuit implant!

Loss of self image, loss due to bereavement, loss of control, loss of innocence. And happily, for Hermie, a loss of youthful angst. Yet at the end of the movie, liberation of a sort awaits Hermie and Dorothy. They've changed, and their experiences change us too. And a beautiful new day dawns... This is the warmest, funniest, saddest, truest movie you'll see for a long time. It is perfect.

I disagee with some reviewer's take on Gary Grimes-I think he is perfect -he IS Hermie-(instead of an actor ""acting"")he's a mix of charm,innocence and self-doubt-caught between boyhood and manhood-how one can identify with the confusion of inner new feelings which are hard to understand.

298385,5,6300268128,"This movie made an impression when I first saw it years ago (and was about the age of Dorothy at the time), and it is still an impressive piece of work.  Those that are upset about the age difference and the supposed ""sexual exploitation"" of a teen boy at the hands of an older woman miss a couple of points: first, this was 70 years ago.  Mores and times were quite different then, so I don't see how we can judge the actions of the participants this many years removed from the time frame.  Second and more important, I didn't see this as sexual at all.  In fact, it's haunting in its beauty, as far as I'm concerned.  Hermie is offering solace to a woman who befriended him and who has lost her husband in WWII; the sex is secondary.  To me, it seemed that Dorothy had, because of her overwhelming grief, put Hermie in the place of her husband that night (she had just received the telegram informing her of her husband's death), imagining that he was there with her, not this young boy.  She is never going to touch and make love with her husband again.  Reaching out in this way to Hermie was, in my opinion, an attempt at one last contact, however bizarre that may seem to others now.  Unless we've walked in the shoes of others, we shouldn't judge.  We don't know how we're going to act until it happens to us.  A touching and sad story definitely worth watching.

298387,5,6300268128,"Herman Raucher's screenplay and poignancy for a classic coming of age tale resonate even more in the actual movie than in the novelization which he also wrote.

The story is simple enough: a boy is catapulted irrevocably on the road to manhood through the sexual right of passage during the first summer of America's involvement in World War II. The ""Terrible Trio"" of friends as they call themselves, go through the nails of coming to grips with their own mortality and losing their virginities in the process. All this takes place in a backdrop of war and primitive America (the New England coast to be exact).

The plot: While vacationing in Nantucket a fifteen-year-old falls and love and gives everything he has to a slightly older woman whose husband went off to fight in WWII. Jackie Evancho, child star, sang a moving rendition of the haunting theme song, The Summer Knows. And indeed it does, for all of us. Her album features the song in all its glory.

The summer is a mysterious time of year. The days are long and yellow, the nights hot and sticky, but luxurious. Family reunions. Trips to the coast. I close my eyes and Im lying in my grandmothers hammock on James Island, surrounded by my young cousins, in the middle of the night, watching the heat lightning flash and blink above the coast. I was in awe; so were they. Below us was the creek trickling with the sound of the crickets in the brush. The reeds beyond the dock. And the weeping willow trees. I can still hear the thunder, feel the warm breeze against my skin. And Im fourteen again, frozen in time. A snapshot from my childhood. You see, in everyones life theres a summer of forty-twothe summer you grew up.

 Anyway, numerous classic scenes pop up which are handled with expert care: groping on girls in the darkness of a movie theater, buying condoms at the drugstore while being ashamed of it, becoming infatuated by someone slightly older and of the opposite sex and lusting after her, your friend making love on the beach whilst being guided by the ""12 steps"" of an anatomy book, and flipping for the first time through that anatomy book detailing all the steps of foreplay.

Indeed there has never been a story quite like this one. In addition, Michael Legrand's score (strings and piano) is a must own.
I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to remember what it felt like to grow up for the first time, again and again.

Check out the excellent and haunting song ""The Summer Knows"" as performed by Jackie Evancho. Enjoy.",1325721600,3,2512,4.631460674157303

The interplay among the Terrible Trio (Hermie, Oscy, Benjie) is quite funny indeed, and most men will relate to the boys' curiosity about sex. But the scenes between Hermie and Dorothy raise this film into an exalted realm of the cinema, capturing the human spirit with rare insight. The sequence after the War Department telegram arrives is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful, sweet, sensitive scenes ever to be filmed. It is handled by director Robert Mulligan with great taste and sensitivity. Among bittersweet, nostalgic, coming-of-age movies, only this one and the equally brilliant (but sadly neglected) ""A Summer Story"" and ""1918"" strike me as achieving such a remarkable level of honesty.

I was never in love with an older person, but that didn't prevent me from appreciating the movie and what it wants to say: War takes away and love adds.  It is a gorgeously photographed and deliciously acted (Gary, where have you been in my life?) piece of lyrical imagery, even as the record ends and the two mismatched lovers dance to the skipping of the stylus on the vinyl.

298477,4,6300268128,"In 1971, when Herman Raucher's only-too-autobiographical film was released, it was easy to love . . . and easy to fear that it wouldn't stand the test of time. In part because of a few thousand more lame and less literate coming-of-heartbreaking-age films since, and in part because it's written and played with a humane grace (if you can call the clumsy surety of Jerry Houser's Oscar and Christopher Norris's Miriam, and even Oliver Conant's exposed-nerve nerd Benjie graceful) long since too rare in this subgenre, this film defies that fear.

I know of no coming-of-age film before or since that explores what might have been a testosterone-lubricated cliche with the unexaggerated realism and romanticism this film still evinces. It becomes even more haunting when you realise Raucher a) changed no names (this was indeed his summer of 1942; Oscy and Bengie were, indeed, his real-life best friends; and, Dorothy was only too real in his life), b) changed only a few small details around; and, c) in due course heard from the real-life Dorothy with whom he really did have what began as an unrequitable love and ended as the heartbreaking sexual interlude between an earnest teenage boy and a suddenly-widowed war bride. (She contacted him after the film's success, hoping their encounter hadn't damaged him psychologically.)

Iif you're looking for such a film with this respectful a portrayal of unrequitable love intertwined with unexpected and untenable sexuality, you're going to have a very long hunt for a very small needle in a very impossible volume of haystacks. There is probably no more heartbreaking climax of transient fulfillment than when Gary Grimes (a Golden Globe winner as Best Newcomer) as earnest, intelligent, awkwardly sensitive Hermie---who has fallen genuinely in love with (he thinks) the unattainable---finds his quiet imaginings brought to bittersweet reality. And there is probably no more nostalgia-obliterating, tastefully-arresting eroticism in film than that of Jennifer O'Neill's likeable, accessible-to-a-point war bride Dorothy reduced to vulnerable, softly hungering widowhood by the ravage of war, though it remains a very open question as to which moment therein is the more affecting: the sweetly surreal imagery of Dorothy about to bed Hermie through opaque, wind-billowed curtains; or, the near-noirish moment that precedes it, when she clings to him in her grief and he manages strangely but empathetically to feel hers, shamelessly letting a tear ride its track down his face (if Grimes let himself be that genuinely lost that deeply in the moment it's one of the greatest pieces of acting by a teenager---he was exactly as old making the film as Raucher was when he had his own Dorothy---in film history), orchestrated harrowingly by the scratchy playing of the film's theme music in a version spearheaded by a cliche-defying tenor saxophone howling hopelessly through a recessed orchestra.

There are certain cutouts punctuating the story, particularly Hermie's unseen mother, who may be a fleeting presence for the sake of the focus but who seems far more wooden and soulless than parents in that time and place really were (Maureen Stapleton interject the periodic hails as the mother); and, the incidental Aggie (Katherine Allentuck, Stapleton's real-life daughter), who shares Hermie's earnestness and gentle clumsiness but isn't allowed much more than a brief hint of the depth she hints at sharing with him despite his nervous disinterest and swelling conflict with the cavalier Oscy and Miriam. But these seem more to be signposts rather than obstructions along the romantically tragic path traveled by the struggling Hermie and the endearing Dorothy.

Disregard the cinematic flaws (as in, catching Hermie's breath outside the drugstore in the middle of summer, Dorothy's house somehow disappearing during a walk on the beach that must have been some lap around that island, the 1970s-style Rice Krispies box among the debris when Dorothy drops her groceries, the playing of ""Now, Voyager"" in the moviehouse scene---a film that wasn't released until after the summer of 1942) and take in a film that becomes more haunting when you realise that Raucher remembered and sketched his Dorothy with a respect you probably wouldn't expect to see or feel from another writer. (Or filmmaker, counting Robert Mulligan's Golden Globe-winning direction.)

Which is pretty damn singular for a film that began as Raucher's bid to write a tribute to his real-life friend Oscar Seltzer (who really was killed in action during the subsequent Korean War), became a tribute to his heartbreaking first love midway through its writing (ok, so he was a year younger in reality than he portrays Hermie---which would get Dorothy arrested and Hermie in court-ordered counseling if it had happened these days), and landed him an Oscar for best factual screenplay and Michel Legrand an Oscar for that impossibly ubiquitous yet unobstrusive music.

If only it could have been a career maker for one and all. It sort of was for Jennifer O'Neill, who went on to a mostly-television career about which you could say she has rarely been long out of work if almost never quite so memorable. (These days, the much-bruised O'Neill---whose promising ""Cover-Up"" series aborted when co-star Jon-Erik Hexum in a gun accident---is a quietly committed pro-life activist among other activities.) It sort of was for Christopher Norris, who arrived soon enough as ""Trapper John, M.D.'s"" earnest former sexpot nurse, Gloria Brancuzzi, for about five seasons, before playing one of ""Santa Barbara's"" vapid vixens and ultimately retiring from acting, for the most part (she was often mistaken for Melanie Griffith, who resembles her strikingly), and earning a psychology degree. It sort of was for Jerry Houser, who's made an even more active character-acting career in film (notably ""Slap Shot"") and television.

For Gary Grimes, alas, it was the opening to a sporadic career that seems to have stopped as of 1991. And, except for Oliver Conant's signing on to make the badly ill-advised, badly-executed sequel, ""Class of '44,"" neither he nor Katherine Allentuck ever again appeared on film or in television.

Herman Raucher, one of whose earlier plays had been contorted into the Elvis Presley mishap ""Follow That Dream,"" had another of his screenplays contorted into a mishap: ""Sweet November,"" which he wrote in 1968, but which---transmuted into a farcical romantic tragedy by a screewriter and storywriter (adapting and melding therein an earlier Italian film) whose brains had clearly gone to bed (and not the way Dorothy escorted Hermie, either)---landed nothing but three Razzie nominations.

298484,5,6300268128,"Before George Lucas gave us a nostalgic ride with American Graffiti, there was this ""coming of age"" classic based on the memoirs of screenwriter Herman Raucher. The story concerns three boys on that summer during WWII corousing around on the New England resort island of Nantucket (called Packett Island for the film), Hermie, Oscy and Benji. Hermie, of course is Raucher who's character narrates. The ""terrible trio"" as they call themselves, raid the Coast Guard station and just plain hang-out at the beach with girls and sex on their minds. Hermie and Oscy make their mission to lose their virginity while Benji, the youngest of the 3 bows out.

Basically the central core of the film is Hermie's relationship with a beautiful local newlywed woman named Dorothy who's husband has gone off to fight in the war. He helps her with her groceries and in a hilarious bit helps her load boxes into her attic. She's wearing a halter-top and shorts and Hermie can barely control himself on the step ladder. The funniest moment has him going into the local drugstore to purchase condoms:

Clerk: How many do you want?
Hermie: About 3 dozen.
Clerk: Planning on a big night, huh?
Hermie: They're for my brother, he's older.
Clerk: Why can't he get them himself?
Hermie: He's sick!
Clerk: Then what does he need them for?! Son, do you know what these are used for?
Hermie: Sure, you fill them up with water and throw them off the roof.
Clerk: OK, I just wanted to make sure you knew.

However, things turn more serious later on when Hermie shows up at Dorothy's to find out that just earlier she was notified that her husband was killed in action in France. Hermie offers comfort for her and the two go off to bed to make love. The scene is done tastfully without being exploitive and Jennifer O'Neil turns in a great performance expressing sadness, confusion and loneliness all at the same time. Almost no dialoge is used throughout this scene except for a simple ""goodnight Hermie"" from Dorothy as he leaves. Hermie comes back the next day to find that she has left the island and left him a note wishing him the best and that he doesn't have to endure life's tragedies like she did.

The characters are very well drawn out. The film focuses on the different perspectives each member of the trio have on sex. Hermie is the more sensitive romantic type, this is evident when he chooses not to tell Oscy or Benji any details of his relationship with Dorothy. Hermie takes his feelings for her very seriously and keeps them private despite the badgering from the other 2. The oafish Oscy, on the other hand, is quite the opposite. He looks at sex as nothing but fun and games and a way to measure manhood. He has no quirks at all about telling all the details of the sexual adventure he had with a girl named Miriam who was part of a double-date he and Hermie went on (being obsessed with the older woman, Hermie passed on the other girl, Aggie.) Nerdy Benji as stated before was the youngest of the 3 and looked at sex as a curiosity but still somewhat ""yucky"".

The film was a major success and earned an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Raucher wrote a novel version after the film was completed but was published before the film's release. So, many thought that the film was based on the novel. In the wake of it's success, Raucher, who narrates that he never saw Dorothy again or heard what became of her, received many letters from women claiming to be his Dorothy. However, one letter did include details only she would've known, plus he recognized her handwriting. She wrote that she was carrying guilt for years that she may have traumatized Hermie, but was glad to find out that everything turned out fine.

I first saw this film on network television in 1973 and thought it was great despite some mild editing. And being 16 at the time, there was no doubt about the crush me and the countless male teens at the time had on the very lovely Jennifer O'Neil. Certainly one of the best ""coming of age"" films of the times. A follow-up sequel called Class of '44 came along a few years later and bombed bigtime at the box office. The only thing of interest in that film is seeing a rather slimed-down John Candy making his film debut.",1252108800,,4242,4.567674113009199
298485,5,6300268128,"Occasionally some person or some event lifts our spirits high above the normal plane of existence and we experience a beauty and a joy that we never knew existed and yet, once experienced, leaves us somehow changed forever. The Summer of '42 had that effect upon me.

I wonder if all of our various experiences of love, beauty, truth etc. are but pale emanations from our Creator who sometimes allures us, not with greatness, but with an overwhelming humility, painful gentleness and sheer beauty?

While the subject matter of Summer of '42 could hardly be described as being of high moral character, it nevertheless sounded a note in me whose very existence I was previously unaware.

Perhaps it was the beauty of Jennifer O'Neill; perhaps it was the stirring words of the narrator ..... for no person I've ever known etc;........ maybe it was the introspective music of Michel Legrand, but whenever I watch certain scenes from this romantic classic I simply cannot remain within myself.

298535,5,6300268128,"Based on the biographical novel by Herman Raucher, the film is able to capture the time and feelings of a teenage boy dealing with new feelings as he discovers that he has a powerful attraction toward a young woman who is seven years his senior.  Perhaps one of the things that makes this such a compelling story is the writer's brutal honesty about his thoughts and feelings.  The author himself captures this very idea with his words that are used in the opening part of the film:

""Nothing from that first day I saw her, and no one that has happened to me since, has ever been as frightening and as confusing. For no person I've ever known has ever done more to make me feel more sure, more insecure, more important, and less significant.""

I think many people have had the new, fresh experience of a young teenager who has developed feelings for someone that doesn't seem to make sense, and yet you can't just ignore those feelings either.

Hermie is a young boy spending his summer on the island of Nantucket.  He spends his days with best friends Oscy and Benjie.  As fifteen-year-old boys, they discover a powerful curiosity about the world of sex.  They even talk Benjie into swiping his parents' medical book so they can ""see and learn how it's done.""  Hermie is just as curious as his friends, but then something happens.  He finds himself infatuated by the young 22-year-old woman living in a house on the beach with her husband who is shipping off to Europe during WWII.  Somehow, because we don't see much of her husband, we already figure this a prelude of events to come.

Hermie is teased by his friends when they learn of his infatuation, and he doesn't take it well.  It's almost as if he views their snide comments as an attack on her as well as him.  Perhaps this is because, like many first-time loves, it is special to him; perhaps even sacred.

He starts by watching her from afar and perhaps dreaming of what it would be like to be with her.  At first, she's just an image, until he finally meets her by helping to carry her groceries home.  We quickly find that she is a very sweet, down-to-earth girl who genuinely likes Hermie, even if it isn't the same type of ""like.""  She welcomes his companionship, as it appears that she doesn't have any other friends on the island.  She sunbathes alone and goes to the movies alone.  And she treats Hermie very nicely even when he finds himself stumbling over his comments to her.  She never laughs or makes fun of him.

Their relationship is handled much like a dream.  We don't even find out the girl's name until the last part of the film.  It's as if the experience has come and gone, and the writer almost has to wonder if it really happened at all.  And yet, this type of experience that is captured so powerfully in this film, works because most viewers can relate to some degree.

Something tragic occurs that allows for Hermie and the girl to come together at last.  However, it isn't in any way that perhaps we expect, which reflects Hermie's experience as well.  He's at her house, and his intention is simply to be there for her.  And although he doesn't realize it at such a young age, his act is a healing kind of love that she desperately needs which makes the scene all the more poignant and beautiful.  It's almost as if that was his whole purpose for being in her life for the short span of time of one summer.  At the same time, Hermie is able to take away something as well: that sex without love is a very empty and unfulfilling thing.

The performances in this film are very good.  Jerry Houser plays Oscy in such a way that we like him even if he's annoying at times.  He's simply a friend who doesn't yet get it because he hasn't matured yet.  We've all had friends like that.

Hermie is played very well by Gary Grimes who is able to use subtle facial expressions to capture the confusion as well as the genuine feelings of a 15-year-old boy in love for the first time.

Of course, we can't mention performances without Jennifer O'Neill.  She plays the girl with a graceful, sweet style that captured the hearts of many young boys at the time this film came out and obviously makes the film work.

The Oscar winning music from this film must also be mentioned.  It also seems to sing of sweetness and innocence as two souls come together to give each other what the other needed at that time.  We find that love, tenderness, and sweetness of experience is in the moment that comes without planning or expectations.  In short, it is a true moment of love.",1203811200,,4546,4.453995157384988

298539,5,6300268128,"I first saw this movie in 1977 when I was 16 years old.  It had come out a few years earlier and had a revival at a theatre in Manhattan. I went to see it on a Saturday, stayed for a second time. Went back the next Saturday and saw it again, then the next Saturday. Then it left and I was heartbroken until the VCR came into being!!!

It is a classic love story, touching, warm, passionate, just 3 guys hanging out in Nantucket for the summer. I can relate, I did it on Long Island at that age. They perfectly set up what the young mind goes through. When jennifer o'neil appeared many a young boys hearts fluttered--man she was gorgeous.  The muscial score sets the tone for the entire movie. It's absolutely beautiful and will stay with you long after you have seen the film.

This is a movie that most likely wouldn't be made today. There are no more classics like this.  Movies today involve violence, car chases, explosions and are geared for 18 year olds. A soft warm story such as this just wouldnt be made and thats sad----the classics are becoming fewer and fewer and only the magic of DVD's and video preserves these classics.

I can understand where people write about the double standard.  This movie shows relations between a 15-16 year old boy and a 25 year old woman. But somehow its not bothersome---its done so tastefully and is not the crux of the story.  If it was reversed, they are right, there would have been an uproar so there is a double standard.

298540,5,6300268128,"Summer of 42, one of the little jewels of the Golden 70's, Robert Mulligan, a veteran Director (The Rain Must Fall and This Time Next Year) hits pay dirt with a wistful coming of age story during early WW2.  The obsession of our 15-year-old boy is Jennifer O'Neill.  O'Neil says goodbye on a New England island beach as her husband goes off to war.  The boys, Gary Grimes, and friends see her across the sand dunes as a sex object.  This reminded me very much of a far more complex film by Giuseppe Tornatore, Melina, which is fairly recent, an Italian knockout abandoned by her army husband.  In Melina and the earlier Paridisio, the sexuality of young teens is the topic of wistful nostalgia.

Filmed in 1971, this island is fine for 1940's beach houses, so add a few 1930's cars and bobby soxer clothing and we have a lovely recreation.  The boys want to do it, calculating whether their Saturday night date will allow further experimentation. Grimes, a handsome, but naive teen has been hanging around, doing odd jobs for O'Neill.  He is quite stimulated while she pines for her serviceman.  Then a tragedy throws O'Neil and Grimes into a desperate tryst.  It's very moving actually.

298541,5,6300268128,"I first saw this when I was barely 12. Now, nearly three decades later, having seen it again, the movie has lost none of its sense of wonder and pathos. Jennifer O'Neil has to be one of the most sultry women ever to have graced the screen in the 70s. Her beauty and sex appeal are more evident than ever in this decently remastered DVD. The melancholic love theme will resonate long after the movie's over. And the 2 main characters, who live on the fringes of mainstream society, start a romance that just cannot be sustained. His a teenager and she's a married woman. Their parting is always imminent. But knowing that midway through the movie does nothing to diminish its watchability. In fact, that makes it even more rivetting. This movie does not pale in comparison to Casablanca. At times, it's even better than that well-known Bogart classic. It's really about 2 very lonely souls who find comfort in each other's arms. A more recent treatment of this theme is found in Sofia Coppola's equally admirable Oscar-winner, Lost in Translation. But in Summer of '42, lies something more deeply rewarding for the audience who's watching it today. There is an all-consuming nostalgia that envelopes you because this is a highly original love story that came from a time when innocence and sexuality could blend together with a sweet, melancholic afterglow. One of the best romantic movies ever made. You can watch it over and over again. Unforgettable.",1168473600,4,1452,4.835341365461847
298542,4,6300268128,"I just had to get this movie just so I could remember it from when I first saw it at the movies in the early 70s and to see the similarites from the movie The Inkwell (1994). Even my youngest daughter noticed the similarities watching it by herself. The only differences are; when the setting took place in the summer of 1942 from 1976, Nantucket Island from Martha's Vineyard, not white but African American. Both young teen males lost their virginity to older married woman, Summer of 42 she lost her husband in the war; The Inkwell, the husband was cheating on her, both women are sad and found comfort in these young men. The Inkwell being a little more funnier, Summer of 42 was still GOOD, SAD and SWEET (like another person puts it)and had some funny scenes too. Like Hermie going to the Drug Store trying to buy condoms (rubbers, hahah!!) and Oscy (Hermie's best friend)trying desperately to get his 1st lay and trying to follow instructions from a Medical book on foreplay leading to sex and exceeding it...haha!! Also Summer of 42 the possibilites of that happening to a normal young man was more realistic. In The Inkwell Lorenz Tate's character was a too weird and awkward teenage boy almost like Benji, Hermie's other best friend who was just too shy to be with girls his own age.

  Seeing Y tu Mama Tambien recently, which was excellent, put me in mind of another intelligent, sensitive, yet very fuuny coming of age movie. I saw Summer of 42, 30+ years ago in downtown Chicago. So I rented it this time.

  Three 15 year old buddies are vacationing in the first summer of World WarII on, what may be Martha's Vinyard or, some other Cape Cod island. They are with their families but you never see them. Hermie, Oscy & Benji are hormone fueled & determined to lose their virginity that summer. They even have a book that tells them how. Oscy: "" Foreplay! You have to play foreplay!""

Hermie has a crush & he's got it bad. He's in love with an ""older"" married woman who has just seen her husband off to war. Jennifer O'Neill as Dorothy is stunning & sexy & really nice in this rustic setting. She is lonely & so is Hermie in that way that most teenagers are. He helps her with her groceries one day & from that they become good friends.

  Meanwhile, Oscy is studying the book & hard at work hooking up with Mariam, a local girl. He also tries to fix Hermie up with Miriam's girlfriend, Aggie. The scene in which Hermie goes to the drugstore to buy condoms is classic & may be this movie's claim to fame. Later, that night Oscy gets his & is devoured by the demure but ravenous Mariam. She apparently does things to Oscy the book never mentioned. He needs all of Hermie's rubbers.

  The next day Dorothy gets a ""we regret to inform you letter.""

Her husband has been killed. Hermie has a ""date"" with her & discovers the bad news. She seeks comfort with Hermie. He may be the only friend she has on the island. Then it happens. The  love scene is tasteful & lingering. There is no overt nudity in this movie. Hermie & Oscy both lose their innocence but in very different ways. Oscy is happy & life goes on. Hermie is introspective & somehow changed. The next day Dorothy is gone & leaves Hermie a letter. He never sees her again. If there is a better summertime romance movie, I haven't seen it.",1126224000,11,2032,4.338624338624339

298606,5,6300268128,"Easily one of the most beautiful and sensitively acted and directed movies I have ever seen, made all the more hauntingly beautiful being set against the backdrop of World War II.

I was 18 in 1971 and as I stood on the tarmac at RAF Kai Tak in Hong Kong, watching an American C-130 taking troops back to Vietnam, the idea that most of us were still virgins was very much on my mind.

At that time, I could certainly identify with Hermie and the boys, in regarding virginity as something that you needed to 'get rid of'. Thankfully, when I did lose my virginity several years later, it was under very beautiful circumstances, and like Hermie, with a woman I loved. In that moment I almost felt sorry for the guys who had lost theirs in meaningless couplings with women they felt nothing for.

Sorry to babble, but I just wanted to convey why this very special movie means so much to me, as it obviously does to the many fine reviewers who have written such wonderful and intelligent reviews.

I have always loved the work of Michel Legrand and he was the perfect choice for this exquisite soundtrack.

I hope young males especially will appreciate this movie and the underlying message that losing your virginity in a shallow, mechanical way is truly meaningless. You have achieved nothing. Don't rush it or feel peer pressure, because as Hermie found, this is how beautiful it really can be.

298608,5,6300268128,"Robert Mulligan's Summer of `42 poignantly tells the story of Hermie and his friends as they fritter away the summer days looking for love and sex in a beachfront town. I've watched a lot of teen movies in my life (Last American Virgin, Breakfast Club, Can't buy me love, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, Fast Times at Ridgemont High) and none of them had the moved me emotionally like this film did.

Hermie spends his days hanging out with friends and occasionally helping out Dorothy, an older woman whose husband has gone to war. In between the comical teenage hi-jinx (the scene at the movie theatre and the scene where he buys condoms are very funny) Hermie's friendship with Dorothy grows closer. Hermie is in puppy love with Dorothy and maybe it would have remained just that if not for the stunning plot twist near the end of the film. Things come to an unexpected head on the night he goes over to visit her and learns that her husband has died. This leads to one of the most powerful sex scenes ever filmed. Through a set of amazing shots set just to music, Mulligan shows how the sex between Hermie and Dorothy is about emotional vulnerability and wanting to be close to someone. In the tasteful sequence you can feel Hermie's uneasiness about sleeping with Dorothy. When standing on the porch to leave Dorothy's house she says a simple goodnight that speaks volumes. Hermie returns to visit Dorothy the next day and finds a note in the door. Reading it he realizes things in his life are forever changed.

Gary Grimes and Jennifer O' Neill give great performances; the chemistry these two actors share makes the film work. The other actors give great performances too, they portray the teens as awkward and curious; the way they talk sounds like teenagers and not like they just got through reading a thesaurus. The set design takes you to the simpler time of 1942 as Mulligan's camerawork tells the story by building tension in just the right scenes. The Oscar-winning score is in the right places and sets just the right mood. If you like teen movies, you must buy this film. It will change the way you see the genre of Teen films.",1093478400,14,2146,4.615183246073299

298610,2,6300268128,"After reading all the rave reviews here, I expected to love this film.  No such luck.
The Summer of '42 has its moments.  The final love scene is beautifully done and the ""making love"" between Hermie and Dorothy is effectively contrasted with the ""making out"" between Oscy and Miriam.
But the script is stilted, and the acting is wooden.  I could have forgiven stilted dialogue between Hermie and Dorothy as a sign of Hermie's nervousness and uncertainty, but the dialogue between the three boys also seemed completely unnatural.  There are a few effective reaction shots of Gary Grimes (Hermie) that do a good job of letting us see his longing and innocence, but he destroys this effect each time he opens his mouth.  I think it is no surprise that we have seen nothing of Gary Grimes since he grew up and lost his youthful beauty.
The voice-over narration and final letter seemed like cheap tricks.  The gauzy atmospheric camera work was as cloying as the swelling strings.  There were obvious continuity problems.  For example, Hermie and Oscy have very short shadows when Hermie leaves his house to meet Dorothy, so it is clearly the middle of the day.  But it is dusk when he arrives at the cabin, which makes no sense unless it is a six hour walk.
I'd suggest renting rather than buying.  If you like romantic coming of age stories, the love scene will scratch that itch.  Unfortunately, it comes after 90 minutes of terrible acting.",1086307200,8,1439,4.716
298611,5,6300268128,"It is the summer after Pearl Harbor. The world is at war, and America is sending her best, strongest and healthiest men to fight overseas. Meanwhile, those too young, old, or physically disabled to serve stay behind, as well as wives and sweethearts. Among these are Hermie, Oscy, and Benjie (Gary Grimes, Jerry Houser and Oliver Conant). Together, this ""terrible trio"" raids the Coast Guard station, frolics on the beach on Packett Island, and sneaks looks at ""dirty pictures"" from a medical book.
But even as the three friends goof around on lazy summer days, the war's effects will soon touch the more serious and sensitive 15-year-old Hermie. He finds himself falling in love with the beautiful Dorothy (Jennifer O'Neill), who is seven years older and married. He worships her from afar, enduring both his friends' merciless teasing and his own confusion about his feelings.
But when Dorothy's husband Pete goes overseas to enter the fray, Hermie befriends Dorothy, helping her with chores such as carrying her groceries to her house on the beach and placing boxes in the attic.
At the same time, the more rambunctious Oscy (and Hermie's best friend) is trying very hard to pick up girls and lose his virginity, and he makes it his mission in life to help Hermie do the same. So he copies information from a medical book that Benjie says ""belongs to the house"" where he spends the summer. Oscy also attempts to set up a date for the ""terrible trio"" at the movies, but that almost falls apart when Benjie and the third girl don't want to go. I don't want to give away what happens next, but it's pretty funny.
But the heart of the movie revolves, as many reviewers have said, around Hermie's love for Dorothy, and how he comes to manhood unexpectedly when Dorothy finds out that her husband has been killed in action. It's a beautiful, discreet and bittersweet sequence, and will leave the viewer with indelible memories of a haunting, timeless experience.
I like Summer of '42 because it is sweet and gentle, hilarious at times, and always very touching. Michel Legrand's Oscar-winning score is simple yet evocative, and Herman Raucher's screenplay was later adapted by the writer into a best selling novel. I recommend this film to young and old alike as a fine example of what a coming-of-age movie should be like.",1073260800,127,2320,4.81704260651629
298612,5,6300268128,"When your asked to name the great romantic films of the '70s inevitably titles such as the ""The Way We Were"" and the much maligned ""Love Story"" come to mind. But most lists always seem to unfairly leave off the wonderful, Robert Mulligan film, ""The Summer of '42"".""The Summer of '42"" was a big box office hit, way back in '71, but now seems to be rarely mentioned or even remembered. Well, I've always loved this somewhat, overly sentimental,'coming of age' story and was overjoyed to find it had come out on DVD.The story takes place during the WWII era on a wind swept, U.S. island, where families go to the beach to escape the summer heat. The episodic film focuses on some fifteen year old boys, who are basically dying of boredom and behaving like average teenagers. The pushy and rather obnoxious, Oscy (Jerry Houser) spends most of the movie try to figure out 'how' and 'when' he'll get sex. Romance dosn't exactly figure too much into his carnal plans. Then there is Hermie (Garry Grimes), who is the exact opposite. He honestly falls in love with a beautiful (but older) warbride named Dorothy (Jennifer O'Neill), who dosn't seem to realize how deep his infatuation is. Eventually the war comes home and tragedy strikes the young women. Hermie is there for Dorothy in her time of need and in the process loses both his virginity and a bit of innocence. Yes, I know this all sounds pretty smaltzy and something out of a pulp romance novel. But to tell you the truth the film really works! Director, Robert Mulligan and screen writer Herman Raucher have combined thier talents to create a movie, which is equal parts nostalgia, romance and in some scenes even humorus (I love the drugstore/condom scene!).The sexual denouement of the film is handled beautifully and with discretion. I love the fact that during the almost silent 5 minute scene you hear nothing on the soundtrack, but an old scratchy record that plays out to it's end groove. What atmosphere! The rest of the film actually has a classic, Oscar winning, romantic score by Michael Legrande, which just sticks in your head and won't let go. If you are interested in seeing a wonderful 'coming of age' story then I highly recommend ""The Summer of '42"".",1067817600,8,2221,4.712082262210797
298661,5,6300268128,"In everyone's life, I often think, there is a Summer of '42 (or '52, or '62, and so on....), a time in which we discover the joys and sorrows of growing up...and falling in love. There are hijinks and pranks, jokes and playful insults...and always the bonds of friendship.  But sometimes, in those days of discovery and self-awareness, we feel the angst of that first attraction, the bittersweet highs and lows of falling seriously in love for the first time -- sometimes with the right person, sometimes not.  And of course, we feel the heartbreak of losing that cherished love...wondering what on Earth happened.
Based on Herman Raucher's autobiographical novel, Robert Mulligan's 1971 classic is one of those rare coming-of-age movies that stands heads and shoulders above those sex-obsessed, raunchy teen-oriented films (Private Lessons, Meatballs)that were released in later years.  Starring Gary Grimes as Hermie, Jerry Hauser as Oscar, Oliver Conant as Benjie, and featuring the luminous Jennifer O'Neill as Dorothy, this lyrical, hysterically funny and heartbreakingly poignant film will ellicit both laughter and tears from all but the most stone-hearted viewer.
Summer of '42's plot revolves around the Terrible Trio of Hermie, Oscy, and Benjie, who live on a small island off the East Coast of the United States.  It's the summer after Pearl Harbor, and all the men of military age are going off to the various fronts to fight the Axis powers. One of these is Dorothy's husband, Pete.
For Hermie, this opens up a whole world of possibilities.  For in between all the usual boyish things he's done with Oscy and Benjie (among them, sneaking looks at ""dirty books""), he's also fallen deeply in love with Dorothy.  He spends time at her house, making himself useful by bringing in the groceries or helping her fix things...the ""how do you like your coffee?"" scene is a gem, evoking all those memories of how far we young guys would go to impress that ""special"" girl.
But before this movie fades to black to the strains of Michel Legrand's ""The Summer Knows/Theme from Summer of '42,"" Hermie will learn that even heaven-sent (in this case, Pete's demise) opportunities come with a heavy price.  Even though Hermie's fondest dream does come true (and the scenes of the preliminaries are among the funniest, particularly the purchase of a condom!), the results are somewhat sobering....and heartbreaking.",1064966400,8,2409,5.098984771573604

Semi-autobiographical, Summer of '42 is an elegiac coming-of-age tale set amid the sand dunes at a small coastal town. Hermie, the protagonist, is just a kid trying to figure out what it means to grow up, how to act around girls, how to lose his virginity (which requires, first, a condom, and gives rise to one of the movie's many hilarious scenes). Then the beautiful woman in one of the summer cottages receives a 'We regret to inform you' letter and seeks comfort in her grief with....Hermie.

Every male adult can surely identify with Hermie as he grapples with the rapid and difficult changes in his young life as he  navigates the thin line separating adolescence from adulthood.

And we  have Dorothy, a young and beautiful woman awaiting her husband's return  from war only to learn of his death.
Combine these two kindred spirits -  a boy waking up to his sexual urges and a sad, lonely woman who has just  lost a husband - and we have the centerpiece of a great and sensitive  story.
