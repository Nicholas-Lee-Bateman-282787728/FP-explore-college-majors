2873349,5,B000RPCJB6,"Without any doubt, Jeremy Brett brilliantly captured the essence of Sherlock Holmes. The arrogance, the sly humor, the over-the-top outlandish mannersims and reactions (that enigmatic quick smile) were perfect. I love Basil Rathbone's Holmes, especially since many portraits favor him; however, Brett's performances are par excellence...there has been none better and I would imagine no one will ever be able to top it.

Not only is his Holmes perfect, Hardwicke as Watson and Charles Gray as Mycroft are also brilliant. If I could rate Brett as 10 stars, I would. If you like Sherlock Holmes and have never seen Brett's portrayal, you are in for a fantastic treat!",1193702400,7,665,5.157407407407407
2873350,5,B000RPCJB6,"It is a joy to have the Jeremy Brett interpretation of Holmes available again.  It is certainly, from my point of view, the definitive interpretation and to have this beautifully presented and high quality set available is good.",1193443200,6,228,5.0
2873351,5,B000RPCJB6,"What can I say here? The quality of these dvds are excellent, but the material on them is even better. For those of you who loved Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, this is a must have. It's only unfortunate that all other Holmes films may be ruined for you once you see Brett in action.  He's the perfect Holmes-- his performance is truly unrivaled.

Besides Jeremy Brett's Holmes, both Watsons are also wonderful to watch.  I got used to Edward Hardwicke's performance of Watson first. However, now I prefer David Burke's more serious take on the role.  Either way, both of them play Watson with none of the pomposity or silliness that you may have seen in their predecessors.

If you are a fan of Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, rather than just the films, these cannot be beat. Although many prefer Basil Rathbone to Jeremy Brett, only 2 of the Rathbone stories are taken from the Doyle canon.  The other films are WWII stories with the Greatest Detective breaking up Nazi spyrings and mobilizing the citizens of England during their greatest fight (well, greatest fight next to the current one going on against Muslim terrorists who are now a fifth column in the UK-- but that's another matter entirely-- maybe we need to see some new Holmes films breaking up terror cells. Oh, but I digress!) And, regardless of your feelings about the Rathbone films, he should be credited with raising Holmes' popularity during this era.

In contrast, all of the stories here are taken directly from the Doyle stories.  As a matter of fact, when Strand magazine serialized the Holmes' stories, they were accompanied by wonderful illustrations.  In every episode of this series, the actors briefly pose and re-enact each illustration! If you're a fan, this is a real treat to see. Actually, everything on these dvds is a real treat to see. The direction is perfect, the sets are luscious, and the costumes are beautiful.

Anyways, the four films included in this set are phenomenal. I am not crazy about the Hound of the Baskervilles story, and that one is my least favorite on the set, but it's still a great story.  All of the hour-long episodes are lots of fun to watch.  Every time I watch one of these episodes I immediately feel like I am getting a big treat and I immediately mourn the fact that there will never be any more. Brett's  death was untimely and came all too soon.",1193270400,35,2369,4.679518072289157
2873352,5,B000RPCJB6,"Watching Jeremy Brett perform in the Sherlock Holmes series is like watching Michael Jordan play in the NBA finals. Whether or not you were a sports fan, you knew he was special and the moments were extraordinary. Brett's performances are like that -- he could communicate more with a subtle series of expressions than most actors with an entire oration. Brett gives us a window into Holmes, without beating us over the head with it. His work is beautiful and graceful. The rest of the show is also first rate -- the recreation of London, Dr. Watson (I always thought that Rathbone's Holmes was cruel to Watson, which was surely not what Conan Doyle intended!) Fans of Holmes already know about this series -- all fans of great acting should watch it.",1192665600,18,751,4.696969696969697
2873353,5,B000RPCJB6,"To a great number of Sherlockians--or Holmesians, if you prefer--Jeremy Brett's performance as the world's first consulting detective was the definitive portrayal.  And while this series has its flaws and deviations from the original text, it is still arguably the best filmic representation available.

I have seen the original MPI releases, as well as a Japanese/Chinese collection, and without question, this new set features the best picture and sound quality.  (Perhaps the PAL version released a couple years earlier in the UK is slightly superior, but I doubt anyone could really see the difference.)  The uniform menu screens and the sharp design of the packaging are also an improvement upon previous releases.

My complaints are few and rather inconsequential, but they are as follows:
1) There are no additional special features, but in fact *fewer* special features than the original DVD releases.
2) The pictures on the faces of the DVDs were chosen somewhat haphazardly, e.g. Hardwicke is featured on Disc 1 where surely Burke belongs. And
3) as to the series itself, during the second half of its run, more and more stories were merely ""based"" on Conan Doyle's work, and with questionable results.  ""The Last Vampyre"" is a prime example.

In short, if you already own the original DVD releases and you are satisfied with that picture quality, you may want to pass on purchasing this set.  For all other admirers of the series, this is a must have.",1191024000,250,1462,5.037344398340249
2873354,2,B000RPCJB6,"There is a major problem with DVD's like these,the original Granada tapes were mastered and shot in England in the PAL format for English tv- which runs at 25 frames-per-second. BUT this box has been slowed down to the NTSC format of 24 frames-per-second and thus it is an inaccurate representation of Jeremy Brett's frenetic performance. Basically an extra minute is added every 24 minutes. I ordered my complete set from Amazon.co.uk in the original 25fps PAL format. Why have remastered picture and sound at the wrong speed??",1190937600,46,528,5.011363636363637
2873355,5,B000RPCJB6,"I bought all five former box sets a year ago, and have watched them multiple times, but I would always watch some episodes feeling cheated.  The Adventures, and The Return box set (roughly the first 24 episodes, and two full films) were in bad shape: it looked like they were transferred to DVD from an old VHS someone had in their basement, and it sounded like it too.  The picture was grainy, and on some episodes the audio warbled.
This box set is what I was waiting for: I got in the mail from MPI yesterday, and have checked out some of the worse looking episodes from the old set...and they look marvelous.  MPI transferred all of the episodes from the original negative, and cleaned up the menus: every single episode and film, cleaned up, and on 12 discs, and in two, high quality cases with a wonderful, heavy duty, cardboard slipcase.  It even comes with a booklet which has information about every episode: an summary of the story, plus behind the scenes information about the making of.  This is the box set I wanted to buy a year ago, and this is the set MPI should have released in the first place.  But better late than never.  Fantastic: anyone who is a fan should buy it, and anyone who has the first five box sets should sell them, and buy this.  It is, truly, the Complete Granada Series.",1190505600,57,1307,4.439330543933054
2873356,5,B000RPCJB6,"This review has been updated on Sept. 18. I received my Sherlock Holmes set from MPI today and as I hoped, it looks and sounds FANTASTIC! I already have watched a lot from the set. You won't be disappointed! I have been sending e-mails for a few years now to MPI Home Video, asking that they remaster this series and make it available on DVD. I am so glad they finally have. Two episodes in their original release of ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"" notably ""The Dancing Men"" and ""The Naval Treaty,"" had audio problems in some of the soundtrack music. They have remastered this series from the original Granada tapes in England. This  resulted in an awesome picture and sound quality. Thank you MPI! What more can be said about Jeremy Brett? Many people, including myself, consider him to be the definitive Sherlock Holmes. His manner, gestures and overall portrayal shows us clearly that he read Conan Doyle and became very well acquainted with his alter ego. The stories are great and this series had that fortunate combination of great acting, writing, music, and production value. How nice to be able to own the entire series in one set. For twelve discs, including bonuses, the price is fair. If you like this series or simply enjoy Jeremy Brett, you should purchase this set.",1187913600,371,1285,4.736607142857143
2873357,5,B000RPCJB6,"It's a tale of contrasts of two fine actors, Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett.  Brett joked that, as an actor, he was rarely allowed into the 20th century and never into the present day.  In many ways he was a throw back to an earlier era; in personality amongst other traits. He was also one to suffer from manic depression. In addition, Brett had a speech impediment as a child for which he had to have surgery and subsequently had to seriously work on his diction and enunciation (that's why, no doubt, thanks to his dedication in this regard, his command of each was something others eventually envied him for).

By contrast, Basil Rathbone was a fencing swashbuckler, athletic and dashing; a talented actor who loved the stage. Rathbone made a fine Holmes in my opinion and most of his 14 films as this famed sleuth are most enjoyable.  But when reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, one's mind, I'd say, surely conjured up a far more complicated man than that played by Mr. Rathbone.  Mr. Brett brought much of that man to life, I'd argue, and, at least in part, some of that was no doubt helped along by Mr. Brett's own experiences as a talented, but troubled, individual.  After all, geniuses do not seem to be cut from the same cloth as most folk; in the sense that abnormality, in some measure, seems to make extraordinary talent a bit more possible.  Sherlock Holmes was such a extraordinary character.  That's what makes Mr. Brett's performances herein so interesting.  Jeremy Brett most certainly brings to the fore the depth of a true Sherlock Holmes type character and makes Mr. Holmes a lot more real. After watching any of these fine episodes you too ought be inclined to  be happy that Mr. Brett's audition to replace Sean Connery as James Bond was less than successful, allowing Mr. Brett to eventually find the role measurably more suitable for him and one in which he thoroughly excelled.",1186531200,185,1902,4.684684684684685

2873380,5,B000RPCJB6,"I used to watch this series on PBS and I loved it.  I received a gift certificate for Christmas and found this series and knew I had to buy it.  I've binged watched it and I still love it as much as I did as a kid.

When I read Sherlock Holmes Jeremy Brett is who I envision in my mind's eye because he is so quintessential Holmes.

The shipping was great and the condition flawless.  Some of the videos are a bit grainy but it has to do with the quality of the original recording, not the disks themselves.",1518652800,,507,4.03

2873383,5,B000RPCJB6,"My favorite Sherlock Holmes. I love Jeremy Brett, he made the role his own, and brought the role to life in a way that I don't think any has.
The set is a great one, including every episode, but there is one down side, many of the episodes are not in broadcast order. The Adventures, which was the first two seasons, are placed correctly, but the second half of The Return are mixed up, as well as the first two specials, and one of the Case-Book episodes has been placed after the start of The Memories. I find it a little annoying, but I guess it's not a huge deal.
Rather than the order of the episodes, it is a fantastic set with all the features of the previous sets.",1517011200,,672,4.176923076923077

2873386,4,B000RPCJB6,"Jeremy Brett does a masterful job of portraying Sherlock Holmes and is assisted by a great supporting cast portraying Watson, Mrs Hudson, and others. The earlier shows follow the original Doyle plot lines fairly closely and are easy to follow. The Hound of the Baskervilles is especially well done. But the later shows suffer from superfluous scenes, often including scenes that start with close-ups and are apparently deliberately mood-inducing rather than pertinent to the plot. The Last Vampyre (adapted from the Sussex Vampire) and the Eligible Bachelor include components of the supernatural that are not in fact explicable by ordinary logic and science. The early shows are outstanding; the later ones include many disappointments. Dr Watson does not appear at all in the Golden Pince-Nez.

The Rotten Vegetables Target Award goes to the closed-caption department of Granada, for allowing a semi-literate team to encode the English-language, thereby effecting homophone and grammar errors throughout the videos with dismaying frequency: its/it's, your/you're, steward/Stuart, their/they're, and numerous others. Granada please don't recruit closed-caption transcriptionists from the cognitively challenged.",1516060800,2,1212,5.925714285714286
2873387,5,B000RPCJB6,"What a loss that Jeremy Brett is no longer with us. I grew up watching him as Holmes when I was a kid in the eighties. I also read all the stories more than once as a kid. As much as I love Elementary and Sherlock as well-done, more modern renditions of Holmes, this more traditional and true-to-the-canon version is one of the very best! And nobody could have done it better than Jeremy Brett. Even near the end, when he was clearly unwell, declining and no longer had the slender and aquiline features  of the Holmes illustrated so brilliantly by Sidney Paget (and as described so vividly by Arthur Conan Doyle) Brett was still amazing! His work translates as art for me and when I watch him I am riveted  by his expressions and his movements  and his take on the character of Holmes. He breathed so much life into this character. I also loved Edward Hardwicke and David Burke as Watson. I loved rewatching these again. It was like being a kid all over again. Also, it was cool to see some of the interviews that were included with this set. I was particularly entranced by the one with Jeremy Brett. It made me appreciate his art even more and wonder how in the world was he able to pull off that character so brilliantly when his own affable personality was the exact opposite of the sometimes cold and difficult Sherlock Holmes that we've come to know and love.",1515974400,2,1366,4.434262948207171

2873391,5,B000RPCJB6,"It's my favorite version of Sherlock Holmes; that has largely to do with the charisma and intensity of Jeremy Brett. I first saw these as a kid on PBS and they still held up upon re-watch as an adult. The episodes hew closely to the original stories and they filled with loving detail. The movie-length episodes are wonderful and (at least for me) are just as compelling in their pace as the shorter installments. If you are a fan of the newer movies or the BBC adaptation but you want something that is closer in tone to the Arthur Conan Doyle stories, this is for you. This is also a perfect intro to the Sherlock Holmes world for pre-teens; my dad introduced me to there series when I was around 8 years old and I was deep into them. Just a delight from start to finish.",1514505600,,773,4.301369863013699

I've also seen the many films made based on the stories, with various actors in the lead role. But nothing comes close to portraying the character created by Doyle than these Granada Film products starring Jeremy Brett. In my estimation, he is the quintessential Sherlock Holmes. His superb acting conveys to the viewer the inner man, the brilliant but emotionally troubled crime solver who finds it difficult to fit into everyday society.  As always, the production values are excellent. I highly recommend this collection.",1509494400,,624,5.178217821782178

2873416,4,B000RPCJB6,"I absolutely love Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, and this set didn't fail to give hours of pleasure. However, I do have to add the caveat that the first episodes are the best. I would say that all of the 1 hour episodes seemed to follow the original plots as penned by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle very well; however, as the series progressed the episodes seemed to grow darker and less ""delightful"". As to the five 2 hour episodes, here is a quick rundown on them. 1) The Hound of the Baskervilles is the only two hour really worth watching, and follows the book to a T; very enjoyable. 2) The Sign of Four may be true to the book (I believe it is one of the only stories I've not read) but it is quite sad. 3) The Eligible Bachelor adds an amazing amount to the book (the story is only 16 pages long), and is done more along the lines of a very ugly horror movie than a suspense/mystery; very poor plot line with little deduction and lots of just plain icky things. 4) The Last Vampyre, while not as bad as the Eligible Bachelor, is still geared toward a horror atmosphere, and not worth watching. 5) The Master Blackmailer is a take-it-or-leave-it type of story; much added to the story as written, but follows the basic plot.",1497830400,,1225,4.3304347826086955
2873417,4,B000RPCJB6,"The series itself is great and worthy of five stars.  Some of the chapters are better than others but not by a great deal.  This series is widely regarded as the best portrayal of Sherlock Holmes to date.  If you were raised on the original Basil Rathbone / Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes series you may miss the charm of the old black and white prints plus the idiosyncrasies both Rathbone and his sidekick brought to the stories, especially Basil Rathbone's articulate and sonorous voice.  He set the standard for later Sherlock Holmes.

Jeremy Brett and the two actors who played Dr. Watson did a wonderful job, and the portrayal of Watson as a serious figure that actually adds to the detective enterprise instead of playing the absent-minded and sometimes confused windbag as Bruce often did, is a welcome addition.

Filmed from 1985 to 1994, you can tell that Jeremy Brett is beginning to fatigue toward the end, which was supposed to go for 65 chapters instead of the 42 that were completed.  Brett died of congestive heart failure at the age of 61 in 1995.  Hopefully, Granada will decide to continue this project with other actors until it is done, although it's been 22 years since the last one.  This is, I fear, not a likelihood.

As is usually the case in British drama, the character actors were uniformly wonderful throughout the series.  The sets were well done, although they sometimes lacked the charm of the Rathbone/Bruce series.  There's something about black and white movies that enhances the detail and adds to the mystery.  There have been only a few attempts to recapture that in modern films and they didn't go over well with the audiences, however.

My only reason for downgrading my review from a 5 to a 4 has to do with the unfortunate case the DVDs come in.  Most people who take pride in the physical aspect of their movie collections want it to look good.  I would have much preferred a vinyl cases for each pair of two DVDs, or better yet for each one, with its own insert front and back.  It could have come with thin cases enclosed in a larger cardboard case, but not the flimsy configuration my set came in.  This appears like a cardboard book with plastic pages, each holding two DVDs.  If this were dropped to the floor it would likely break apart.  With two DVDs on each page, its often necessary to remove one to get to the other. If one of the pages were to crack, break, fail to hold the DVD or come undone, the entire case would become far less functional. It appears to have been a means to cut costs.  I would have much preferred to have paid the extra few dollar for a set of individual DVD cases.

This last aside, this is a great collection of Sherlock Holmes stories and I highly recommend it.",1497744000,15,2740,4.537678207739307

2873421,4,B000RPCJB6,I really do like these stories it's just too bad that they were not produced in one continuous series. They were produced in small groups in different years. When they came back to do more of them at a later date the style and quality of the production changed. The attitude of the last stories is very different so they don't look or sound like the first stories.,1495756800,,364,4.367647058823529

We watched the Boscombe Valley Mystery tonight and totally enjoyed it.  Recordings are excellent and English subtitles work for those who don't hear well.  P.S.

2873439,5,B000RPCJB6,"Jeremy Brett's Holmes is without a doubt definitive.  His intelligence & love of the character, his relationship with Dr. Watson is filled with respect and extreme care (reciprocated by both David Burke's & Edward Hardwicke's Watson.)  The adventures sparkle, the language is so beautiful through Jeremy's well trained voice.  All the supporting players seem to walk right out of Conan Doyle's pages.  Jeremy's hard work and struggles to create the character of Holmes, his attention to the cannon, even to his hand gestures, how he stares down the villain and the way he sings ""Mrs. Hudson's"" name is spectacularly portrayed.  If Sir Arthur could have seen what was possible when the great Jeremy Brett donned his most singular creation, he never would have killed him off!  Jeremy's Holmes is so alive!  Most of us think he is anyway, but Jeremy makes us sure of it.  My favorite scene is in the Final Problem when Holmes & Moriarty meet at 221b. Moriarty has most of the lines but Jeremy is all eyes! The non-verbal sizing up of these two mental giants creates a suspense and tension in the short scene that is palpable.  I think this & the next ""the Empty House"" play well together, like a 2-parter.  Watson's, ""Where you want & when you want"", says it for the rest of us.  For we are lucky as he is to be witness to the life of this great, abet imperfect, man, and to take off after him on these bonny blue adventures. & We are terribly lucky to get to do so through Jeremy Brett's enormous & generous talent.",1490054400,2,1514,4.591078066914498

2873451,5,B000RPCJB6,"I am a big fan of the Sherlock Holmes books, movies and the series that have been produced.
Jeremy Brett's performance as Sherlock Holmes is one of an actor, who has tried to remain faithful to the character, while putting his own stamp on this fictional sleuth's eccentricities and talent of deduction, with a voice worthy of the mind of such a talented justice seeker.
David Burke and later Edward Hardwicke complete the duo with their versions of Dr. Watson. They are both talented in producing the performance reflected in the stories. They make sure that Dr. Watson is capable, astute, supplies some comedic moments, is in awe of the master detective, and Needed to fill in Sherlock's lacking in emotional response to the humans that inhabit Holmes' Earth.
The result is one of a faithful rendition of the stories and Arthur Conan Doyle. They both humanize these characters and promote the ""otherness"" of Sherlock Holmes persona with great care.
The Granada Television Company has done a great job in selection of stories, production value, and execution in this box set.
I would highly recommend this journey in viewing for those who appreciate deduction, genius, and balance of emotion and pure fact, while enjoying the voyage of seeing if you can solve the mystery before the ending...

2873573,5,B000RPCJB6,"Jeremy Brett is the definitive Sherlock Holmes in my opinion.  I first saw this series on PBS in the 1980s and 1990s, and I was hooked on it.  Jeremy Brett brings out the true character of Sherlock Holmes, the intelligence, the arrogance, the desire to meet a challenging case.  Holmes does not suffer fools gladly, this comes out clearly, in Holmes impatience with the lesser characters.  In addition, I very much enjoy the atmosphere, the feeling of being in 19th century London.  This series is well worth buying, for a true recreation of Sherlock Holmes.  JRV",1452556800,,563,4.8125
2873574,5,B000RPCJB6,"I have been a fan of Sherlock Holmes for more than 45 years. My first introduction was the legendary versions starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Then I bought the complete works and really enjoyed the stories even more. Despite my continuing fondness for the 40's movies, I consider Jeremy Brett, as do most people who review this series, to be the best actor to play the role.
I bought this set around Christmas time, shortly after it was released at a Costco store, and the price if I remember correctly, was slightly more than Amazon is selling it for. Some reviews have complained about the packaging and that may be a legitimate issue due to the presentation of the set, but my guess is that is due to shipping/handling. My set was not shipped so I have had no issues with it and I watch the series at least once a year, taking care in handling it. There are two volumes to the set, encased in a two-piece archival-type ""box"" if you want to call it that. It is similar to ""boxes"" used in libraries that contain valuable and rare books and manuscripts. As a bonus it contains a booklet on the episodes and the whole package is very well done. It isn't at all like the simple two-piece gift boxes or the open-sided collection boxes most sets come in.
This set is not my only one. I have all but two of the Rathbone films, all of the Ronald Howard TV series and even an Arthur Wontner portrayal as well as Christopher Lee. At one time I owned Deer-Stalker hat and stayed in a London B&B on Baker Street one of the times I was in England before I retired from the travel industry.
If you have never read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories, you can also get a digital set for your tablet very cheaply here on Amazon. I have that too and I am currently re-reading it as well. As I read these very familiar stories, my mind automatically pictures Jeremy Brett, Edward Hardwick and David Burke telling the tales. One bit of trivia: Sherlock Holmes is the most acted character of all time. And Jeremy Brett was the best of the bunch.",1452470400,,2035,4.386243386243386

But if you want to see faithful dramatizations of Arthur Conan Doyle's stories set in the original time period, this is the set to get.  Where possible, the scripts are true to the word, I would say 98% of the time.  Jeremy Brett threw himself into this role 100%, and the two actors who played Dr. Watson also did their best to bring authenticity to the role.

2873633,5,B000RPCJB6,"I have been a Jeremy Brett fan for many years--- he is, in my opinion, the preeminent classic Sherlock Holmes of the over 100 actors who have played Holmes over the years. And, Edward Hardwicke is the best of all the classic John Watson's. His character is played to perfection and not made out to be a half-witted buffoon stumbling around for comic relief.
  Having seen a quite good number of actors in the roles of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson over the years, I was so surprised, astounded even and so pleased the first time I watched Jeremy Brett and John Hardwicke in The Naval Treaty.  This was the first in the Granada series I ever watched, but it certainly wasn't the last.
  Brett's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in these stories was in many ways a labor of love, and perhaps towards the end of his life, it may have became more of a love-hate thing, but no matter how ill he was, he never stinted, diminished by so much as a look or a word the performance of the character of Sherlock Holmes he was portraying. When it came to playing Sherlock Holmes, Jeremy Brett WAS Sherlock Holmes, the sharp, astute, antisocial master of detectives, whose stories became a large part of the foundation of todays modern crime forensics.
  I very much wish Jeremy Brett could have lived to portray Sherlock Holmes in every one of the over 55 stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle, because he was the best of all.
he and Edward Hardwick made a great team--- the very best of the classic Sherlock Homes and Dr. John Watson characters ever done.",1438387200,2,1541,4.541516245487364

IThey were fun but it wasn't really the Sherlock holmes that I knew . I grew up(to my regret) and learned how wonderful my local pbs station was. In the 1980s and 90s they were showing the Brett versions of the Doyle stories. This was the Sherlock I remembered from my childhood. These were the stories I loved and still do. I ordered this set knowing I would watch these episodes over and over again. I also purchased some very comprehensive book editions for the times I wanted to read what was read to me as a young boy. These episodes were so very close to my readings. Such joy on a dvd.
 THEN THERE WERE the british tv series .Not even close. Now we have another present day Sherlock series. Its good entertainment but it is NOT Doyles Sherlock Holmes. Only the Granada series with J. Brett is as close to the Sherlock of my youth and the one I believe Doyle would approve. Brett adds his own BRILLIANT nuances that I could imagine as being those gestures of THE REAL SHERLOCK HOLMES. The other shows, series and films are fun and enjoyable  but not the Sherlock of Victorian England. Not the one that is as close to the stories as written by Sir A.C. Doyle. I watched a dvd from the set tonight and thoroughly enjoyed these episodes so much I just wanted to share the pleasure this series has given to me. It took me 6 years to get around in sharing the joy of this series.

Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke do a fabulous job as Holmes and Watson.  The sound quality, which must have been remastered, is better than when the series was shown on Public TV, but  still leaves something to be desired.  When the characters speak in whispers, the dialogue is lost.  That, however, is generally a problem with all British produced TV programming.

Edward Hardwicke speaking of working with Jeremy Brett on the Sherlock Holmes series.
""During our 10 year association, I was privileged to get to know Jeremy very well. We became great friends. We both believed that the friendship between Holmes and Watson must be rooted in humour. In reality, Jeremy made sure there was always laughter when we were working. In spite of the enormous strain his illness placed on him he never lost his sense of joy. He had a wonderful laugh. It was infectious. The enormous list of actors and technicians who worked on the series will tell you that they never had a happier job. That was Jeremy. This, of course, was the background to a great actor giving a great performance. I shall miss him."" (IMDB)",1410825600,6,913,4.8152866242038215

2873878,5,B000RPCJB6,"The late Jeremy Brett was born to play the classic Sherlock Holmes as depicted by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the same way Sean Connery is born to play Ian Fleming's James Bond.  He fits Conan Doyle's description of Holmes like a glove from the piercing eyes to the pointed nose and the long fingers to that voice.  Granada Television teleplays all four Sherlock Holmes novels and 56 short stories faithfully.  Granada Television also recreated Victorian London so faithfully to the point of rivaling the best 3D simulation imaginable.  I am not a fan of several actors sharing one role, but in this case both Edward Hardwicke and David Burke gave such a magnificent performance as Dr. John Watson that I could not find fault with either actors.  The casting of the secondary characters from Mycroft Holmes (Charles Gray) to Inspector Lestrade was perfect.  If one saw the short stories as they were original published in The Strand Magazine with the accompanying drawings, Granada Television made those drawing come to life.

2873894,5,B000RPCJB6,"I am thoroughly enjoying this series.  It is giving me many hours of pleasure.

HOWEVER, much as I appreciate subtitles to help with British accents, I would have to give the subtitles a lower review.  I guess it is the editor in me, but I can't help noticing MANY defects in the subtitles.  In many cases it does not matter (e.g., ""matter of speaking"" rather than ""manner of speaking,"" ""shaw"" rather than ""pshaw,"" ""awe"" rather than ""ahh,"" ""he appalls the possibility"" instead of ""he abhors the possibility"" - you get the point).  But in some cases the errors in the subtitles changed the meaning.  If I were going strictly by the subtitles, I would have been confused or even misled. ""Martyred on the altar of our country"" became ""Motto and the oath of our country."" Opposite meanings sometimes:  ""foundered on"" became ""founded on.""

The minor faults I listed above are just an indication of carelessness throughout.

I have not noticed this in other British films, but perhaps I was not paying close attention.  Once I sensed a problem here, I watched quite carefully and was very disappointed.",1406073600,4,1096,4.81283422459893

2873907,5,B000RPCJB6,"Granada did a great job of putting together these series of Sherlock Holmes stories.  The picture quality is very good as is the sound, especially since this is a DVD package and not BD.  There is a BD version available on Amazon, it is from Spain and on Amazon.es it comes with a cheaper price. (you would think England would be first with the BD versions).
Jeremy Brett makes a GREAT Sherlock, he really makes the role his own.  He whoops and laughs and jumps up in the air when a normal person would do so rather than play the entire time as a reserved semi-human.  He also has the famous Sherlock black moods.  David Burke plays an intelligent Watson, Edward Hardwicke takes up the part when Burke could not return for the second series and is equally as good and stays for the rest of the series.
The stage sets and location work are very good, costumes and set decorations are great (the Brits really do a good job on these period pieces with proper research, when they spend the money).  All in all a really nice collection of Holmes.
The scripts do not stay with the original stories but rather make some changes but not TOO drastic, mostly for cinematic effect or to fill out the full time allotted for the episode.  They are still set in Victorian (and Edwardian) Britain which is why I enjoy them.  When they bring Holmes ""up to date"" the stories lose their punch (in my opinion).  Holmes is doing forensic science in the 1890s when it was almost unheard of anywhere in the world and that is what interests me in Conan Doyle's stories.  When updated to the 1930s or 40s it is not too bad but for present day they just don't make it.
Everybody has their own favorite actor portraying Holmes, to many it is Rathbone (as he was the first one they saw).  I enjoy watching them all, but Basil is among the best.  I consider Rathbone, Brett and Cushing to be the best in looks and manners.  Cushing did an earlier BBC series in the 1960s which would have been excellent but the production was rushed and the cost were kept low, as was the case for Douglas Wilmer (as Holmes) who did the even earlier series for BBC, being replaced by Cushing when he refused to do a second one for the stated reasons.
Granada did right by Holmes spending some bucks on these series and it shows.  I did a Holmes marathon when I received this set, every evening I was watching episodes of Sherlock until I ran out of discs.  Recommended.",1405036800,2,2424,4.403587443946188

My complaint is not about the material, but about Amazon's return policy.  I hope I don't run into a defective disc.  I have 30 days to determine that or they won't accept a return or replacement.  So I must watch every disc in 30 days.  I'm not going to do it, I'd like to really savor these shows.  This is what keeps me from buying many complete seasons of shows.  Why should I have to watch 9 years of Perry Mason in 30 days, or I can't get a replacement for a defective disc?  I won't purchase the complete Star Trek TNG.  If I don't have a hyper marathon to watch all 8 seasons in 30 days, Amazon says sorry Charlie to defective discs.  And when you do return these, you get the entire box again.  So instead of a defective disc 2, you might then get a defective disc 3.  Sheesh.",1404518400,13,955,4.204419889502763

2873932,5,B000RPCJB6,"At 64 I grew up on Basil Rathbone's characterization of Sherlock Holmes. He looked and played the part superbly. But the plots were hatched by Universal Studios during the 1940s. A few were even used as war propaganda and only two films were faithful to period or to Doyle's storylines.

Other actors came down the pike taking their turn donning the stereotyped, if not nauseating, deer stalker cap and absurd Calabash pipe as Doyle's detective, but each failed to hit the mark for one reason or other. Dashing about London wearing a deerstalker ensemble would have been an unforgivable Victorian social faux pas. Dr. Watson was often played as a fool or comedic foil. Doyle's plots were pulled and stretched beyond recognition. They made Holmes a lover of the fairer sex. The latest from Hollywood took a classic hero and fed him into the special f/x machine to emerge as some bizarre, modern, super hero.

If you are still looking for the one and ONLY Sherlock Holmes. The man who breathed life into the Victorian detective, and embodied the spirit given to him by Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle; it would be Jeremy Brett in the made for television Granada Production of Sherlock Holmes. Granada Productions produced a series that was loyal to the Doyle scripts, accurate to costuming, locales, sets, character actor selections and even paid homage to Strand Magazine's illustrator, Sydney Paget, with its vignettes of his several illustrations carefully woven into the episodes. They will, of course, escape the eye of those not familiar with the original Paget illustrations, but they are the Easter Eggs of the series for the dedicated reader.

Jeremy Brett possessed every quirk, mannerism and gesticulation of Sherlock Holmes down pat. And finally, we have a Dr. Watson who is truly worthy of the great detective as not only sleuth companion, but a friend who shares apartments. Finally, Holmes wears the black morning coat and accoutrements of a Victorian gentleman of London. He does don the deer stalker in a few episodes but ONLY when investigating in the English countryside!

Finely acted, loyal to the real characters, lavish sets and costumes, it is a visual feast for the Sherlock Holmes fan. It would only be Brett's untimely death that would prevent he and Granada from completing the canonical series as they had planned.",1400544000,5,2333,4.989717223650386

2873961,5,B000RPCJB6,"I fell in love with this show on Netflix and then they dropped it so I dropped them.  :-)

I am completely in love with Jeremy Brett's portrayal of Holmes.  He is the BEST there ever was and I doubt we'll ever see a portrayal this amazing again. He IS Sherlock as so many have said and he is so much better than the drivel that is passed off as Sherlock Holmes today. Brett portrays his genius, his dependence on Watson and his vulnerability/loneliness that seeps through the cracks of his persona occasionally. It is just a terrible, terrible shame that his health failed him so and prevented him from portraying Holmes in every story as he said so in so many interviews he wanted to do.

Not to be forgotten David Burke and Edward Hardwicke are fabulous Watsons.  They set the record straight on what Watson was really like and don't make him a bumbling fool like so many.  Hardwicke is probably my favorite of the Watsons because he seems to have more of a introspective and nurturing quality about him, but as I said, both are great portrayals.

The costuming and sets definitely set the bar for shows of the era and I honestly think helped pave the way for the detail and quality of such other period dramas as Downton Abbey.

Yes, he's better than Rathbone, Cumberbatch, Caine, or Downey.  The stories are the most faithfully adapted, the costumes are gorgeously accurate, and the music is deliciously evocative. And Brett!

But I wanted to caution anyone who is thinking of purchasing this set that the picture quality is not good in parts of the programs that have a lot of detail. The manufacturers have placed too many programs on each DVD which forced then to compress the video too much. At times the picture is great and at times it is very grainy.

Great DVD Set but picture is lacking.

UPDATE 09/21/2015: I have discovered that the DVDs are single layer discs. So in order put (4) 50 min programs on them they had to be compressed a lot and that is why the picture is bad. I have also had some of the DVDs to hang and not play. Come on, Granada could have done better than that! I purchased all these shows on VHS tape and now on DVD and if I could find better quality set I would purchase them again. I love the shows!!!",1383696000,14,859,4.076923076923077

The boxed set that held the DVD's was scratched in areas by someone (with a paper clip or pin) on the outside!

DVD #1 played well UNTIL the last 5 minutes of the last program. It began to stop, freeze and pixels imposed themselves so there wasn't any way to view the ending.
DVD #2 DID NOT play at all!
I checked and tried to  play DVD's #3 through 12: Each one had glitches while playing as well as scratches on the side of the DVD that plays when inserted (into the DVD player.)
I was willing to pay the price for a quality product.
Instead I received an inferior DVD set that the company tried to get rid of!!! If I hadn't previewed the discs or had been saving them as a gift, I would have been fleeced!

In this case, I should not have worried. The episodes I thought I had remembered well were even better than I had remembered. The episodes I have never seen (there were more than I expected) were just as good.

For a series mastered for small screen TV, the picture and sound quality are very good. The dynamic range of the audio is fairly large for TV, so I frequently use the subtitles, which don't always follow the audio precisely. I give it five stars because the quality of of the material makes me forget trifles like subtitles.

I watched a few of the older shows and while OK, they didn't really make that much of an impression.  When I watched the first episode with Jeremy Brett I knew that this was for me.  The care and detail that went into the show, and the fact that each episode was based on an actual story or book really kept my interest.  In fact now I am reading all of Holmes original novels and short stories.  The later shows when Jeremy is ill are not as good, but still very watchable and I would recommend this series to any Sherlock Holmes fan.  My favorite moment of all is at the end of The Copper Beeches.  Where Jeremy Brett brilliantly smashes the fourth wall and lets us know that he is having fun with Watson.

2874044,5,B000RPCJB6,"Jeremy Brett makes occasionally flawed stories not only fun but the series addicting. I think I expected a little more from the Upstairs/Downstairs writers. But I don't care overmuch because so much works so well. Brett plays Holmes as someone almost giddy from ""the game"" like what we see in a video game enthusiast. And his sport is contagious to the viewer. The old stories seem to be merely tunes he dances to. He's exaggerated in the most wonderful way, using close ups and long shots equally well. His presence full bodied and quirky, light though not absurd. It's if Brett's Holmes just stepped from the drawings of a graphic novel. And it leaves me wondering how he can get away with playing Holmes this way because I don't think anyone else did. But it is wonderful.

The sets and settings get better and better to the point at which I marvel at those alone considering when it was made. It's fairly well cast for the most part, and sometimes I see performances and shots that are so good I look forward to more and more.

The change of actors playing Dr Watson after the first season, while the first actor was a more dynamic Watson, he was good. But the second actor is perhaps even better as he is perhaps aspected to Holmes more classically, as more of a support. But I liked both.

I've come to really look forward to relaxing behind an episode or two in an evening. It makes me feel smart without making me prove my worth - something drama often aims for with broad audiences. Whether or not I actually can solve the mysteries, which may or may not contain enough clues, I feel like at the end of the day it's a job well done and all's right with the world.

For the minor flaws, I still can fairly give it 5 stars.",1366934400,4,1730,4.396875

Brett played Holmes with an excellence that is delicious to this Holmes fan. Personally, I intensely disliked the Rathbone version and refused to watch more than snippets. Watson was an educated man and in the David Burke/Jeremy Brett versions, Watson is a confidant, an assistant, a researcher, and wears many more hats. It is the way the work was written.

Brett is practically perfect as Holmes, and the two actors playing Watson (David Burke (seasons 1 and 2) and Edward Hardwicke (remainder) are excellent characterizations.

This was a re-visit of the show since its initial airing from mid to late 80-ies. I remembered some episodes but it was really great seeing them in order, the way they were on this amazing set. This is available at Costco for $99 in Canada and in USA is probably in $50 range, brand new from the shelf. For that price, this set is total steal.

I am watching this DVD set for second time and I am somewhere half-way through. Show is really clever and done well. Jeremy Brett's deliverance of Sherlock Holmes is so impressive - I wouldn't ever dreamed of seeing any other version of Sherlock. I remember I was 10 or 11 when this was on TV and I remember running to the TV to watch it ... Now that I am older and have seen million shows, movies and TV programs, this one still has its spark. Every single story is intriguing and told well. The mood and feel of the time is awesome. Personally I love the way those characters look and speak. It is a feast for eyes and ears. I also remember that my high-school English teacher always said to study Jeremy Brett's pronunciation of words (if English is your second language). It was considered English Language at its best I suppose.

I can't say anything but great things about this DVD set. It's complete Granada Series in one packaging with a few really cool bonus features. I highly recommend getting it if you are interested in mysteries of any kind.",1356393600,,1561,4.379310344827586

I have seen many different portrayals of Holmes on the media, but Jeremy Brett is THE Sherlock Holmes for me. His animated performances are intriguing and brilliant. The production values are also quite good. The two Watsons David Burke and Edward Hardwicke complemented Mr. Brett's performance quite well. The series portayed Holmes as a brilliant driven man including his dabling in the '10% solution' and is occasional depressive episodes.

When the price of the collection approached something I considered reasonable, I purchased it. We are only a few episodes into watching the collection, and are very satisfied with the presentation and the quality of the DVDs.  I have read all the Holmes stories, and have not yet spotted any glaring errors. The case is both secure and presentable.  Some of the reviews have mentioned that the later stories lack the energy of the earlier ones, due to Brett's ill-health, but so far, the earlier stories capture all the magic and energy of Doyle's great detective.

Jeremy Brett is the definitive Sherlock, he gives me chills every time I watch him act! Never was there a better performance as the Great Detective than was given by the Immortal Jeremy Brett! Don't be fooled by such imposters as Basil Rathbone, Robert Downey, Jr., and Christopher Lee, none of them come close to Jeremy Brett! Both David Burke and Edward Hardwicke are excellent in their portrayal of Dr. Watson, and the series is a masterpiece of writing and directing! The episodes force the viewer to involve his/her brain in the mystery, relying on intellectually stimulating dialogue, rather than action sequences alone, to keep the deep plots moving and exciting. This is not for the passive viewer, rather, it is a delectable feast of intellectual mysteries presented in such a way as to stimulate the mind. Never will there be a better representation of Sherlock Holmes, so true to the original stories by A. Conan Doyle, than Granada Television's ""Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes""!!! Do yourself a favor and watch these. You'll never regret it! Magnificent! Intellectually stimulating! Rich with knowledge and humor! Delightful!

David Burke is more the kind of Watson Sir Arthur envisaged than the bumbling fool in the Rathbone movies. Brett has to be the best Sherlock Holmes ever filmed. If you don't own this set yet and you are a Holmes fan, this is a must for you. By the way, Brett played the young dandy in love with Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady. While it appears he is singing ""On the Street Where You Live"" in that movie, the song was dubbed which irritated Brett.",1339718400,,592,4.201754385964913

I have always been a fan of this particular series and used to watch an episode every Sunday on PBS, but I know that wasn't enough. For someone who is a die-hard fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his Sherlock Holmes series, this collection is a dream come true for me. I own The Complete Sherlock Holmes compilation published by Barnes and Noble in 1992, so I know all the stories by heart and I must say that the portrayal of the stories in the series are quite accurate. I must say, Jeremy Brett is the best Sherlock Holmes to date. He, as an actor, brings Sherlock Holmes to life. The verbage used in the series does not disappoint either. It is refreshing to hear ""proper"" English in this day and age. How I wish I speak the same way in my day to day existence. This, to me, is a priceless collection for any Holmes fan.",1335830400,8,916,4.2102272727272725

Basil Rathbone set a high standard with his 14 movies but Jeremy Brett truly was Holmes with these 45 brilliantly crafted episodes, that are also closer to the original Conan Doyle stories.

What sets this Granada 12 DVD set apart is the GREAT PRICE AND QUALITY. The menus, sound, color and clarity could not be better. They all play perfectly.

These DVDs are a joy to watch, especially if you remember the old TV version, or have ever seen the cheap imitation sets that have been around.  Once upon a time they were the only option if you wanted an affordable DVD set. With THIS set you can forget about:
- Chinese menus
- Old TV quality picture

Wonderful cast and crew have made this series an exceptional treasure.  The story line and screenplays stay marvelously true to Conan Doyle's own words and the dialogue is absolutely impeccable.  So many hugely entertaining little scenes in each disc but overall it becomes a masterpiece.  ""Woodley went home..in a CART!"" coupled with Brett's wavering little grin makes me laugh out loud every time I see it!

As much as I hated seeing David Burke leave, I thought that Edward Hardwicke's portrayal of Dr. Watson was a seamless transition.

2874105,4,B000RPCJB6,"Jeremy Brett is the definitive Holmes in my opinion.  His performances are flawless and to watch him at his best here is worth the purchase price.  Chillingly good at times.  Now, let's get down to the business of the screenplays.  This series starts off great.  The first volume is solid as can be.  I had a habit of reading Doyle, then watching the Granada episode within a day.  With a very few minor exceptions, the first volume follows Doyle so closely that it's scary.  The Priory School is the first sign that things are going to go  haywire... REALLY haywire.  I guess the screenwriters felt they could improve on Doyle by adding bits here and there.  Sigh.  Volume One finishes well despite ""Priory"" but Volume Two's opener ""Lady Carfax"" may have you wondering if the filmmakers actually bothered to read the Doyle.  It's hit or miss from then on.  ""Sign"" and ""Baskervilles"" are very well done, but from ""The Master Blackmailer"" on until ""The Red Circle"" you're gonna be scratching your head.  ""The Mazarin Stone"" is possibly the worst offender, next to ""Vampyre.""  All in all, a good run at the first, but the way it all ended up makes me sad.  Such potential.  Still, Brett is riveting and he alone can ease your suffering through the re-writes.",1319500800,4,1256,4.68348623853211

2874108,5,B000RPCJB6,"Perfect in every way.  Jeremy Brett plays Sherlock Holmes with a sense of dangerously ambiguous sexuality that heightens the famous eccentricity and cold intellectuality.  Both David Burke (earlier episodes) and Edward Hardwicke are outstanding as Dr. Watson, the perfectly affable, perfectly ordinary English gentleman who serves as the earthbound foil to the meteoric Holmes.  As with any good BBC series, they are supported by all those wonderful actors that seem to grow on trees in Great Britain.  There is some tinkering with the plots to make these stories more stageworthy (Arthur Conan Doyle frankly lacks the dramatic sense of, say, Charles Dickens or Agatha Cristie), but there is no tinkering with the basic Victorian nature of these tales.  This is classic literature as it should be filmed.  The sets and costumes are sumptuous, the acting is superb.  An added treat is the ""subtitles"" (English and Spanish) that take the place of Closed Caption - FINALLY I can understand all of the dialogue!  The video quality is good for a series filmed in the late 1980's.  So light the fire, pour yourself a cup of tea (or a glass of sherry), and be happily transported to a time long ago and a place far away.",1317340800,4,1213,4.9068627450980395

2874111,5,B000RPCJB6,Jeremy Brett even looks like Holmes. If you go to London and visit 221 B Baker St they will quite possibly tell you Jeremy Brett is the best Holmes. The ator who plays Professor James Moriarty  in this series looks like what you have dreamed him out to be. The nature of the writing makes it very pleasent to watch this as an ongoing tv series.  But the time you reach The Final Problem you will be nearly as excited as you were with the written novel.  Each actor who plays Watson is very good as well. The settings and costumes are the finest.,1315267200,2,545,4.221153846153846
2874112,5,B000RPCJB6,"Comparing the video and audio quality of this DVD set to individual broadcasts on PBS is just not fair.  Video and audio are so much better in the DVD's as to make them feel like a totally new experience.  What also seems to be true, as with other BBC productions, is that little scenes and vignettes have been cut out of the TV broadcasts.  Not so, with the DVD's.  Again, this makes for a completely different experience in viewing the full episodes.

Aside from the top-grade re-mastering of the original productions, this set offers Special Features of interest to both the casual Sherlock Holmes viewer and those who may be more intensively involved.  Vintage interviews with Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke are provided; also, an old interview with Arthur Conan Doyle's son.  Also included is a handy reference guide to the 41 episodes contained in the Granada TV anthology.  The guide describes plots and characters of each piece, along with quotes from many of the prominent actors.

With all the tripe that is pushed onto us from network TV, cable channels, and Hollywood, it's good to see there are sources for real stories, made for an adult audience.

2874120,5,B000RPCJB6,"A really great thing about the Granada series of the Doyle Holmes stories is the musical score.  Appropriately, the solo violin is featured as Holmes was a violinist (apparently sometimes even a good one when in the mood!).  I think the composer's name is Patrick Gower.

Amazingly, Gower used the same musical theme, played principally on the violin, over and over and yet never bored the listener!  His secret?  The answer lies in his musical craftsmanship and mastery of classical forms such as fugue, passacaglia (used for the Reichenbach Falls episode where the violin plays a fittingly elegiac version of the main theme), theme and variation, marches (as in the Silver Blaze episode), and more.

Nothing like music contributes more effectively to atmosphere, mood, emotional tone, narrative development (through the use of leitmotifs).

This has been mostly an impressionistic assessment based on memories of my intense enjoyment of this series when first I saw it on PBS back in the '80s. I wanted to draw attention to a brilliant composer who really contributed to the success of the series.",1305417600,8,1099,5.106145251396648

I had seen another version where the dog wasn't even a hound, more like a German shepherd.  But they got the dog right in this series.

From the late, Jeremy Brett as the great detective to Watson (portrayed by two different actors) and the host of villains, victims and other characters every episode is a work of art.  This complete of 42 episodes is an absolute must on that basis.",1297900800,6,465,4.8

We truly miss him very much and would have enjoyed more of him than only 41 episodes!  Many of the fans say the same words of him so I shall not repeat what has been already about him.
My dream of possessing this collection came true when I actually received my order.  I was so happy to watch it again on my PC.  A collection for Sherlock Holmes fan would be incomplete without this fantastic recreation of Sherlock Holmes by Jeremy Brett !!",1296432000,6,691,4.236641221374046

2874128,5,B000RPCJB6,"I'm a BIG fan of Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes, so much so I have difficulty seeing anyone else in the part.

However, I would recommend to other readers here that they see the Hammer Studios version of Hound of the Baskervilles, with Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes, Andre Morrell as Dr Watson, and Christopher Lee as the young Lord of Baskerville.  They did make some changes to the story line, but Cushing clearly established the Holmes that Brett would later add on to and excel in.

I've also heard lots of good reviews for the USSR TV version of Sherlock Holmes starring Vasily Livanov and Vitaly Solomin, as Holmes and Watson, in a version that seemed to anticipate the ITV version, with the exception that Vasily played a somewhat more charming Holmes.  But so far I haven't been able to purchase it to judge it for myself, as I presume there may be region changes, in Russian, with perhaps no English sub-titles.

My personal favorite line was the last in the Basil Rathbone version of Baskerville, ""Quick Watson, the needle!""",1295136000,4,1037,4.738888888888889

My pre-teen kids who watched portions of the show (here and there), loved sitting through on weekends for Sherlock Holmes nights and it took us an year to go through the DVD's on and off.  I do wish that the shows were in the order of their original TV premier and the DVD's were in sequential order too.  There are a few shows missing from the original TV show (please see the 1st reviewers comment).

I have seen other TV/film renditions and this Granada version is superior to all.  The key to this is, of course, Jeremy Brett.  After you have read the stories, close your eyes and imagine what Holmes would look and act like in real life - I bet you no one will come closer than Jeremy Brett.  Jeremy Brett truly captures and brings to life the cold and calculating brilliance, the mercurial demeanor and wonderfully understated sympathetic nature of Holmes.  Also, the two actors playing Dr. Watson were equally excellent as are the other actors making repeated appearances.  The DVD pictures look really good, with good color.

We have all read the 56 stories and 4 novels and believe J.B.s perfomances fulfill all the characteristics as written by Doyle. J.Brett has clearly studied every word and has painstakingly played the roll to perfection. Being commercial free adds to the joy of watching.

2874141,5,B000RPCJB6,"Many wonderful actors have taken on the iconic role of Sherlock Holmes over the years.  Basil Rathbone was great, Ronald Howard was certainly enjoyable, but Jeremy Brett will forever own the part of Sherlock Holmes.  He and this series are everything Sir Arthur Conan Doyle envisioned when he wrote the original stories.  The production values are top notch, the scripts (adapted from Doyle's original stories) and the supporting cast are nothing short of brilliant.

Brett became Holmes, finding the humanity behind the Great Detective, with plenty of energy and humor.  Even in the last episodes, as his health failed (in fact, unknown to all - himself included - he was dying), he never failed to give an amazing performance.

David Burke and Edward Harwicke played Watson with all the warmth, humor, humanity and intelligence Doyle ingrained into the character in the original stories.  The bumbling Watson of the Rathbone/Bruce series is nowhere to be found (in fact he's nowhere in sight in the 1954 Ronald Howard television series, either, another great Watson as played by Howard Crawford).

The series has been remastered and looks beautiful!  Do not hesitate to pick this one up today!  Word of advice - do try to get this one from Costco, where it retails for only $99!  This is the greatest television/film series ever!",1285891200,3,1331,5.031963470319635

David Suchet is Poirot, Patrick Tull the definitive reader of the Aubrey/Maturin series by O'brian and Jeremy Brett is the definitive Sherlock Holmes as written by Doyle.  The others are cartoons beside his portrayal.  For anyone who is already a Holmes fan or for someone who is wondering what all the hullabaloo is about, this is the dvd set for you.  There are reasons classics are classics as written and Brett will show you why Holmes fascinates after all the years he has been before the public.  Enjoy.",1284595200,4,612,4.735849056603773

2874146,5,B000RPCJB6,"To characterize the BBC's revival of Conan Doyle's most widely known and popularly loved character as the ""best"" would be a criminal understatement.  Jeremy Brett's definitive portrayal as Sherlock Holmes is arguably THE greatest performance ever done for film.  With subtle nuance and splendid idiosyncrasies, Brett imbued the multi-dimensional yet conflicted character with indisputable perfection.  Edward Hardwicke and David Burke are both fantastic, etching themselves (along with Brett) in the annals of 'inimitable TV characters'.  Everything about this BBC production is first rate--not surprising since Masterpiece Theatre/Upstairs Downstairs was created by the same people.

He laughingly tolerates all the blissfully intellectually impaired and goes about solving mysteries seemingly like magic by using his incomprehensible powers of deduction, observation, and imagination.  Brett plays Holmes with a sardonic humor that makes each case more interesting than the simple facts prove them to be.  Each case is compelling due to the use of remarkable actors playing odd and anything but normal characters of every sort.  Edward Hardwicke playing Holmes's loyal companion and faithful friend, Dr. Watson does a commendable job and manages to not be completely overshadowed by the invincible Holmes's flamboyancy.  Watson is also endowed with great intelligence rather than portrayed as a bumbling fool.  Watson is therefore credible as the best friend of a man with the superior mind of Holmes.",1282435200,3,883,5.455882352941177
2874149,5,B000RPCJB6,"Sherlock is a perennial, appearing in many forms. Robert Downey Jr was v. good in the recent movie (his Watson, Jude Law, appeared in the Grenada series as a stable hand and female impersonator). Basil Rathbone was the classic guy for a long time. But no Sherlock comes close to Jeremy Brett. The Grenada series, which went on for 5 years, is terrific. Uneven, of course, but uneven at the highest level --- the weaker ones are still v. v. good, and the best are terrific. Two different Watsons, hard to say which was the best as they were both excellent. But the show totally belongs to Brett, despite a consistently good supporting cast.",1281484800,,639,4.614035087719298

2874165,5,B000RPCJB6,"Everybody knows him -- the pipe-smoking detective on Baker Street (with or without the deerstalker), who is able to deduce all sorts of things just by glancing at a person.

And while a lot of recent adaptations have completely bastardized Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's brilliant detective, ""Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Granada Television Series"" shows off Sherlock Holmes at his best. Not only is the writing and direction amazing, but Jeremy Brett, Edward Hardwicke and David Burke are simply brilliant in the main roles.

Holmes (Brett) is an elite detective living at 221 Baker Street, where he runs a detective agency. But he doesn't take run-of-the-mill cases -- he's called in for the truly baffling, bizarre cases that nobody else can figure out. Assisting him is Watson (David Burke and later Edward Hardwicke), a doctor who is less brilliant but more down-to-earth than Holmes, and sometimes Mycroft Holmes (Charles Gray), his even more brilliant brother.

Together, Holmes and Watson unravel countless bizarre, almost unsolvable cases -- kidnapping, murder, fraud, international intrigue, sinister puzzles, theft and stuff that simply doesn't make sense. Using keen observational skills, a talent for disguise, human psychology and plenty of seemingly insignificant clues, Holmes alone can figure out whodunnit.

Sherlock Holmes mysteries come in two types:
1. The case is completely baffling, and Holmes is needed to unravel the knot of obscure clues.
2. The case seems straightforward, but Holmes is needed to connect seemingly unrelated clues to the crime in order to find the REAL perpetrator.

There are plenty of both kinds in the four series included here, with dozens of cases that require Holmes' unique detecting skills. Some are better than others (""The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes"" suffers from a distinct lack of Brett, due to his early death), but virtually all are well-written, intelligent and entertaining.

The writers do an excellent job faithfully translating Doyle's stories into the visual form, and there are some wonderfully creepy moments (such as the ""monkey man""). And the dialogue is remarkably smooth (and sometimes funny), sticking to the old-timey flavor of Doyle's prose (""Your conversation really is most entertaining. If you would close the door, on your way out, as there is a decided draft"").

Brett is considered to be one of the two best Holmeses in movie history, and he's nothing short of brilliant -- he plays Holmes as a brilliant, manic individual whose mind focuses to a knife point when confronted by a problem. And despite Holmes being arrogant and blunt, Brett infuses him with a kind of bouncy warmth.

At the same time, David Burke and Edward Hardwicke do excellent jobs as the much maligned Watson --they play the sidekick as being not a genius but is definitely intelligent, warm-hearted and capable. And Gray, Colin Jeavons and Rosalie Williams round out the main cast nicely.

Brett remains one of THE greatest Holmeses of all time, and ""Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Granada Television Series"" is a suitably excellent adaptation (albeit with a few drawbacks).",1274832000,7,3120,5.248995983935743

2874170,5,B000RPCJB6,"If you like Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, you'll LOVE this series. I've seen several other series based on Doyle's stories--the one with Basil Rathbone, the Russian Sherlock Holmes series, and the 1954 US series with Crawford and Howard among them. While these are all good, no one can touch the Granada series--it is the most faithful to Doyle.  The actors and producer put a lot of work and thought into doing that, and it most definitely shows. Definitely worth a buy--something you will enjoy for years to come! Where this series differs from many others is the relationship of Holmes and Watson; and, in fact, the actors became good friends off screen as well as the filming went on.

If you enjoyed the series, please consider the supporting the petition currently underway for Jeremy Brett (playing Sherlock Holmes in this series) to be given a posthumous BAFTA (UK version of Oscar and Emmy rolled into one). Please look for ""posthumous BAFTA for Jeremy Brett"" on Google or Facebook.",1271462400,4,1000,4.911242603550296
2874171,5,B000RPCJB6,"This is the definitive collection of Sherlock Holmes and features Jeremy Brett as our favorite sleuth. This entire series is the best of all the Sherlock Holmes' series available on DVD. Jeremy Brett was the only actor who could perfectly portray Holmes's personality to a 'T' along with his biting sarcasm, clever wit, and somewhat superiority complex. Yet he also accurately revealed Holme's friendship towards Dr. Watson and his angst at being so intellectual compared to his peers. If you're a Holmes fan, tnen this is the series for you. Technically, this DVD collection is of excellent picture and sound quality. It does have limited special features though and I wish it would have contained more.",1269648000,6,704,5.077586206896552

2874174,5,B000RPCJB6,"I haven't much to add to my fellow reviewers regarding the quality of Granda's work, and of the actors. I do however want to comment that one of the best reasons for buying this set is the music and end credits I'm aware that there is a soundtrack and considering how rarely it surfaces for purchase to the public, it's probably best to get while you can.

But the end credits themselves tell a much larger story than just a soundtrack. There's artwork, and sometimes the action continues during the credits such as in the Speckled Band, and the Hound of the Baskervilles just to name two. I consider this music to be Patrick Gowers' best work (hope he doesn't disapprove). I've never known there to be so much time and resources invested into the music of a TV series, not even Xena and Hercules which has a LOT of music (not in the credits though). It adds one more reason to the many others that makes this show so special. I had only ever seen the series on TV before I got this set, and you KNOW how TV can chop up credits.

There are at least 35 different musical arrangements in the whole series and probably many more than that, not counting Granada's, MPI's and the series' main themes, just as part of the opening and ending credits and I'm sure there's lots more music in the body of the episodes. In the beginning there was pretty much just the main title theme, but after about 7 or so episodes the dam broke and the new tunes kept coming forth like rain from the heavens. Most of the music is violin as you would expect, but sometimes not. The Priory School is a boys' choral number, the 'Eligible Bachelor' is a woman's operatic number, and the 'Man With the Twisted Lip' is not musical at all; just the sound of the 'beggar's' clothes burning in the fire. Just to name a few. For a few episodes the main title theme is stuck at the end and a new musical piece put in at the beginning.

If you're an end credit nut like I am, you will want the series itself even if you get the soundtrack too. I don't see mentioned much, but the little booklet that comes with this set is great; it gives a piece on each episode, plus some background and trivia.",1267488000,6,2161,4.304668304668304
2874175,5,B000RPCJB6,"The Granada production of Sherlock Holmes that spanned ten year period was in my opinion a true masterpiece.  Jeremy Brett's truly amazing performance and presents as the legendary English detective is the powerhouse core that made this great production unparallelled.  All the cast is well above par, and both David Burke and especially Edward Hardwicke are exquisite Dr Watson's.  The writing and production values are also at the same level excellence.  I must say some of the later stories seem a little off (such as the last vampire) but are still held in place by the master cast.

The complete 12 disc collection of the series is a great joy with very good prints and is a must for all Sherlock Holmes fans.  If there is anything detract from this collection, it is the rather sparse extras included with the shows, and the rather crude menu system for the DVDs. It's unfortunate that Jeremy Brett didn't live to complete the remaining stories that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote of Sherlock Holmes.  Jeremy Brett is unparalleled in the role, no one has come as close to encompassing the character and I would be surprised if anyone ever does.",1266364800,5,1148,4.7969543147208125

I bought the series for myself as a Christmas gift, and they are splendid.  The scenery, costumes, and actual estates and castles where they were filmed are breath-taking.  I think there is no other actor who portrays Holmes better than Brett.  I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys history, mystery, and beauty.  The quality of the DVD's is wonderful.  They arrived earlier than expected.  They were packaged well and arrived in perfect condition.  With the weather outside very dismal, I have not had cabin fever, because the Sherlock Holnmes series and also the Upstairs-Downstairs boxed set I purchased along with it, will keep me enthralled thru the Spring thaw!",1266019200,4,878,4.8389261744966445

The Granada series is a must own for any Sherlock Holmes fan, from enjoyer to fanatic. Edward Hardwicke is an incredible Dr. Watson as well. These episodes, most of them are about 48 minutes long, were made with the original stories in mind. Granada's goal was to keep it true to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original short stories. Holmes is eccentric yet reserved, odd yet obvious, and a master of deduction; while Watson is not a bumbling idiot as in the earlier films, but a colleague and friend. If your thinking about purchasing this series, you will not be disappointed.",1265760000,5,682,4.739495798319328

Since they actually follow the writings of Doyle so closely sometiems I am not sure if I have watched the episode or read it, which is a nice change from so many interpertations.

2874185,5,B000RPCJB6,"Jeremy Brett was so fun. He was, in my mind, and in the minds of many other good and informed persons, ""the best"" Sherlock Holmes. The source material was never intended to be much other than great fun, by the frustrated admission of its author who had wanted more space from Sherlock in order to write more highbrow literature. ""The Noble/Eligible Bachelor,"" for instance, might be ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" with some makeup and costume changes, but...

Who cares? Yes, who really cared, when we had such a marvelous actor as Jeremy Brett at the helm? An eccentric character calls for an eccentric thespian, and the strangely haggard yet faintly effeminate Brett added just the right dash of genuinely interesting nuances that watching him was a delight. If you tire of the clich-ridden modeling that passes for acting in today's TV and movies, this might be your ticket.

The supporting actors were mostly great also, and some of the scenes were just pure gold. Instead of a woman moving out of the way of her murderous husband's fatal but utterly avoidable blow, she stands there and screams until she's hit by his elaborate wife-killing-jury-rigged-thingy, and then she gasps out, in her dying breath, a line to her husband that she was on to his shenanigans and has told others about it: great melodrama.

This series made the rare achievement of having it both ways: superior acting while not taking itself too seriously. In a way, sort of an anti-Hollywood production. Long live Jeremy Brett. Sir, you were and always will be Mr. Sherlock Holmes.",1264982400,2,1559,4.875471698113207
2874186,5,B000RPCJB6,"Jeremy Brett defined the role of Sherlock Holmes just as Sean Connery did for James Bond.  Others have tried, but none quite capture the essence of this challenging character.  Edward Hardwicke is equally good as Dr. Watson (who narrates the actual stories by Arthur Conan Doyle).  The Holmes stories are generally short enough that every significant detail can be included, whereas most novels are too long to allow that.  The look, feel, and atmosphere of Victorian and Edwardian England come alive in a way that seldom occurs on film.  This is British tv at its finest.",1264982400,,572,4.916666666666667

Every show is missing vital scenes that were originally part of each episode. I believe that any charge that this series is too far removed from the original stories would vanish if what was edited out was still there.

The DVD collection provides all 41 dramatic presentations from the Granada Television series that aired on PBS in crisp color and imagery.

Brett was a genius when it came to his delivery of Holmes, breathing life into this stiff and basically unemotional man. For two decades, Brett and his two Watsons along with an incredible cast of English actors made Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work come alive.

NTSC is 30 frames a second, not 24. PAL (UK/Europe video) is 25 frames a second. But, my dear Steven, these Sherlock Holmes episodes were shot on 35mm FILM, which sports a 24 frames per second frame rate. They were NOT shot on video, which you were trying to say in your rather uninformed review. This DVD set was remastered from the original FILM NEGATIVES. So both PAL and NTSC frame rates have to be bumped up from the 35mm frame rate, this is done in the mastering process. In addition to the US version of this set, I also own the PAL version (I have a PAL DVD player also) and the two are made from the same negatives, and look virtually identical. But the US set has more commentary and extra features. Anyone that owned any earlier versions of the MPI Video US releases of this TV show will see a dramatic difference here...this set is more than worth the money as it is of the highest quality.

So, I waited a long time to finally order this collection, since it's not exactly cheap (worth every penny though!). I have been really impressed with the product. The packaging is attractive and sturdy as it should be. The series itself is just phenomenal. I always thought Basil Rathbone played a pretty good Sherlock Holmes, but Jeremy Brett is simply outstanding. The acting is great; the sets are amazing, all the way down to the costumes. It really is a perfect portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes, you will not be disappointed! If you have teenagers that might be interested, this is a great series for them too!

The series itself was excellent, and as so many before me have said; Jeremy Brett does not play Sherlock Holmes, Jeremy Brett IS Sherlock Holmes. My wife, who had not seen it in her youth and who is younger than I now loves the show. This compilation is amazing and the video and audio are of an excellent quality. Everything down the the menu screens is perfect. We liked the music in the menu screen so much I bought the soundtrack, and often after an episode has finished and it returns to the menu we'll just leave the menu music playing to fall asleep by. Sadly I have been unable to find the track used in the menu in the soundtrack, but the soundtrack is still excellent.
I can only report a few minor glitches. The menu system seems like it was not tested after it was designed. Often when you hit menu it will start the episode, return you to the DVD intro or begin playing another episode entirely. Additionally I have had two separate DVDs in the collection freeze for just a few seconds.

Jeremy Brett blows away the past portrayals by other actors in the past. The costumes are wonderful as well as the smart dialog and scenery.  So over a short time of watching this once a week on PBS I found the whole 41 episode series.
My biggest disappointment is that Jeremy Brett had passed away at 62 in 1995 of heart failure at his London home before the project of filming all the Holmes stories could be completed. Brett's heart had been damaged by a childhood case of rheumatic fever and was apparently further weakened by his heavy smoking. Very distressing also that he suffered from manic depression. It may as sad as it is have added to the characters idiosyncratic mannerisms.

2874234,5,B000RPCJB6,"Seldom in the annals of television production does one creation so typify what television has the potential to become. Though it was a culmination of many people, inevitably, it was the producer (John Hawkesworth) that brought this masterful crew together that deserves ultimate thanks.
  Rarely does a single actor so perfectly portray a character as does Jeremy Brett bring to life, Sherlock Holmes. For anyone that merely likes the Holmes universe, they will love this series. Jeremy Brett brings Holmes to life like no actor before him nor one since. It was a perfect portrayal and a flawless depiction of Doyle's master work. Enough cannot be said in praise of Brett's brilliant depiction.
  Added to Brett' stunning onscreen persona was the brilliant portrayal of Watson by David Burke. Burke gave the truest example of Watson's character ever filmed. Watson was never a bungler as was portrayed in that silly 1940's adaptation by Nigel Bruce, he was always supposed to be an intelligent man that next to Holmes was merely above average. Watson was always supposed to be us, what we would be like while trying to keep pace with someone as extraordinary as Holmes and Burke seamlessly offered that generous accompaniment to our favorite detective. That is not to take anything away from Edward Hardwicke for his attempt at the same role, but where Hardwicke was good, Burke was perfect.
  The actors that played guest clients and villains along the way, were all well thought out and never detracted from Brett and Burke's brilliant performances. The set designs and costumes were perfect and the production values were far ahead of their day as they can be even better enjoyed on HD-TVs today.
  I would be remiss should I not also acknowledge Mr. Hawkesworth's most excellent adaptations of the original A.C. Doyle stories. Yes there is some literary license taken along the way and not all the stories are verbatim but this is television not reading. To my sensibilities, it is the spirit of the books that Hawkesworth captures rather than having to place word for word the actual story and I believe he accomplishes that expertly.
  For anyone wondering if this compilation would be right for their dvd collection I can only say; your collection will be far from rounded without it. The price may be steep but if you can afford such luxuries, afford yourself this luxury for it is an indispensable addition to any cultured and well rounded movie collection.",1223769600,5,2466,4.963592233009709

2874239,5,B000RPCJB6,"I have to confess that I've never considered myself a Sherlock Holmes fan.  I've never read any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books and have only watched one Holmes-based movie, Case of Evil, which many considered mediocre at best.  However, you would have to be a bonafide hermit to never have heard of the Greatest Detective Who Never Lived!  But when I happened to catch a few episodes of this series on Maryland Public TV, I found myself addicted to Sherlock Holmes.

Watching Jeremy Brett play Sherlock is downright fascinating.  I guess you don't have to read the books, watch the movies, or be a ""fan"" to know that Sherlock had as many idiosyncrasies as he had talent as a sleuth.  The almost eagle-like quality of his sudden head movements, coupled with brief yet distinct facial expressions are just a few of the ways that Mr. Brett made his Sherlock come to life.  His arrogance and downright rudeness to his clients are reminders that Sherlock was a self-made man who must have possessed a fascinating past, if only Mr. Doyle would have delved into it in his novels.  Even the famous detective's addictions are depicted in the series.  His partner, the good Doctor Watson played to perfection by David Burke, add to the mystique of Sherlock.  Dr. Watson's admiration and affinity to the eccentric detective is mirrored in Mr. Burke's performance, as it probably is in Edward Hardwicke's performance (but I haven't gotten that far in the series yet).

The set contains 12 CDs beautifully packaged in two collapsible CD accordion files.  The first contains a booklet with photographs and a synopsis of each episode.  The files fit nicely inside the outer slipcover.  I don't usually spend that much money for CDs but I think it was well worth it.  It's an excellent series on a quality product.  It's a shame that there will be no future episodes of this series (Mr. Brett passed away in 1995), but with at least 40 or 45 episodes to choose from, I'm sure I'll be enjoying the series for many years to come.",1221004800,2,2014,4.711428571428572

Except for a few episodes - Last Vampyre, Eligible Bachelor etc, every other episode was brilliant. These two mentioned above, were slightly implausible and only based on Conan Doyle's work - not very good adaptations because too much license was granted to the directors/ screenplay.

2874244,5,B000RPCJB6,"Grenada Television's superb dramatizations of the Sherlock Holmes detective stories are now available in a single large DVD collection, featuring Jeremy Brett as the master sleuth and including the made-for-TVs movies.

Jeremy Brett is surely the definitive Holmes of this generation. He portrays Holmes as a complex, multi-faceted, sometimes off-putting genius.  The enthusiasms, quirks, theatricality and moodiness of Arthur Conan Doyle's private detective are on vivid display.  Equally gratifying is Edward Hardwicke as an authentic Doctor Watson, steady, loyal and a contributer to the cases, not the buffoon favored in the old Basil Rathbone movies (David Burke does a solid turn as Watson in ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"").

The stories themselves are reasonably faithful to the originals.  Adaptation to the screen has produced some trimming of storylines, but the original plots are clearly visible in nearly every case.  A few, like ""The Last Vampyre"", are significant departures from Arthur Conan Doyle's versions, but the end product in each case is still very worthwhile.  ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is especially noteworthy; it is as good a dramatization of that most famous Holmes story as has been done.

The production values on the episodes are uniformly excellent.  Location shooting is the rule, as the series explores a series of authentic country homes, old schools, and other appropriate locations around England.  Carriages, furniture, clothing and other props are equally well-chosen.

This DVD collection is very highly recommended as absolutely superb entertainment for fans of the Sherlock Holmes tradition.",1205884800,13,1646,5.623481781376518

2874246,4,B000RPCJB6,"The difference between the earlier episodes and the later is not simply the change in the actor portraying Watson.  There is a complete departure (with a new producer) from the brilliant concept (so rare in adaptations like these) of actually FOLLOWING the classic stories.  Certainly even the earlier episodes had some significant differences from the stories.  Most obvioiusly, though not altogether unattractive, is the transformation of Watson to someone who is sort of a miniature Holmes, able to explain the master's deductions and make some of his own.  But with the shift in producers, comes a complete disregard for the original stories themselves.  Hound of the Baskervilles, probably THE classic Holmes tale, is absolutely gutted--and often completely gratuitously. Some of the most impressive surprises in the real tale are simply removed for absolutely no reason.  Characters functions and roles are changed, and the entire story suffers. The number of guns multiplies dramatically (everybody has one, including a shotgun!), and the very crucial scene of the final attack of the hound literally becomes a yawner.

More than just the scenery, the actors are presented so clearly that were you to compare a screencap from this set with one from the old one you would hardly recognize them as the same person.  Even the sound is clearer, regardless of one review about the speed of the transfer.  For example, in the episode of ""Silver Blaze"" you can actually hear Holmes/Jeremy Brett talking to the horse to calm is as he starts to wash its face.  I never heard that in the old set.

Buy this for Jeremy Brett's incredible acting talent, if nothing else (though there is a LOT more).

Edward Hardwicke and David Burke are also great Watsons - each in his own way - many people like one over the other, but I love them both for different reasons, and therefore cannot choose.  I certainly wish they still made series like this! Sure, it's not perfect - a few of the episodes are not quite what I would like them to be - but considering the sheer volume of what they did get right?  I won't squabble over a few sour notes.

I've watched about half the DVDs in this box and I can tell you without question that they are excellent -- the best looking and sounding edition of these shows yet.

Unlike past editions, these DVDs have been mastered using the original negatives from the Granada TV archives and the result is superb. There is absolutely no problem with speed -- physical movements are natural and jiggle-free and dialogue is clear and natural, neither too fast nor too slow. Color, contrast and blacks are excellent. (If that's not the case for you, I suggest a thorough diagnostic of your playback system.)

So much for the technical and on to the real beauty of this series. Jeremy Brett is the quintessential Sherlock Holmes. He brings a sharp, elegant, nuanced performance to the character that is endlessly fascinating. Dr. Watson (played by David Burke early on and later by Edward Hardwicke) is portrayed not inaccurately as a bumbler (as in the Hollywood films), but as a thoughtful, capable companion and assistant to Holmes -- the way Sir Arthur Conan Doyle portrayed the character in his stories. Add beautiful writing and direction, a consistent, outstanding cast of supporting players and Granada's never-flinching excellent production values, and this series stands as one of the greatest ever produced for television.

I highly recommend this set to any Sherlock Holmes fan.,1523923200,,353,5.103448275862069
