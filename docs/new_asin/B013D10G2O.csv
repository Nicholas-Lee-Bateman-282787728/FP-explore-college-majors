It is beautiful on so many levels - from her loving words of wisdom, to the moving music, to the specific techniques she shares, and the way the chapters are laid out.

Karena shares her heart, her faith and her practice. I found this video to be uplifting and inspiring and also so full of peace. Kundalini yoga is something to be experienced and this video truly brings the experience into your home. Karena teaches from such a genuine place that you feel as if you are alongside a true mentor. Karena teaching demonstrates the transformative that will occur if we would only live from the heart with authenticity and expectation of miracles. This video is a keeper and a true blessing! I am SO grateful to have it in my home. 5 million stars!",1445990400,6,717,4.565891472868217
7363229,5,B013D10G2O,"LOVE all the dvd's from Karena virginia. the most inspiring messages, and a yoga practice that balances mind and body effortlessly.",1445990400,3,131,5.285714285714286
7363230,5,B013D10G2O,Karena Virginia is the perfect person to exercise with.  She is sincere and charming and I always feel completely relaxed in her company!,1465689600,,137,4.956521739130435
7363231,3,B013D10G2O,"While I love the video for the most part, I find a few things distracting. There are sections where Karena talks, and sections where she does yoga. She also flashes a beautiful rose throughout the video. I think i would have enjoyed this more if she talked in the beginning and did all of the Yoga in the end. Also, while the first shot of the rose was beautiful, I thought that the roses throughout the video were distracting. Karena does have a very warm presence and provides good information. I feel better just by doing the warm up!",1465603200,5,537,4.434343434343434
7363232,5,B013D10G2O,"Very informative for both the Kundalini students, teachers and those wishing to know more about the many health and spiritual benefits of Kundalini Yoga.",1461196800,,153,5.416666666666667
7363233,5,B013D10G2O,"Unfortunately, I first used this DVD after the 30 day return option had expired. The DVD does not work. It just loops around the first 30 seconds over and over. I was trying to contact the seller, but couldn't get there. I hate leaving a bad review, but this was a waste of time and $. I'm hoping the seller will see this and offer to send one that works. :) Thanks!

Update : awesome customer service. A replacement DVD is on the way. Wasn't worth the hassle of shipping the defective one back, but they didn't require that. Very good service at Sounds True. Thank you!

Now I'm assuming lighting doesn't strike twice in the same spot and the replacement will work. :)",1456358400,,669,4.387096774193548
7363234,3,B013D10G2O,It's OK ... but just Ok ... not as good as some of the high rated reviews would have you believe.,1455926400,4,97,3.6666666666666665
7363235,3,B013D10G2O,"Karena is very sweet but I personally felt that this video was lacking a bit. She seemed to talk a lot and although I resonated with what she was saying, her philosophy takes up a bulk of this DVD. At times I felt I could listen to her voice with my eyes closed and continue, just to look up and see her doing something completely different. So I take away a star.

Also, as a forewarning, these poses/postures/exercises have you using your arms/shoulders/upper back muscles A LOT. If you are someone like me who has a shoulder injury (tendonitis for me) or is weak in the shoulders/arms etc., this may not enable you to fully enjoy any heart opening or gratitude due to the amount of pain you're experiencing. However, on the flip side, these postures could be super beneficial for strengthening those muscles! I wouldn't like to discredit this video due to my own physical ailments/weakness, but I really wanted more for the rest of my body during this session. So I take away another star.
All in all, I've seen far worse yoga videos out there, and this one is decent!",1455667200,11,1071,4.549222797927461

7363237,1,B013D10G2O,This is a terrible yoga DVD! It's mostly talking and not much yoga. I've been doing yoga for over 20 years and I wanted a good home yoga workout and this seems to be a workout more for the gereatric crowd! I'm  returning this one...,1454198400,3,232,4.155555555555556
7363238,5,B013D10G2O,"I have had the privilege of taking Karena's Kundalini Yoga classes and always find them to be healing, regenerating, insightful, inspiring, motivating, enlightening, peaceful and they bring me to a place within myself that I believe touches my soul. I suffer from chronic pain and often times I can not participate in many of the physical movements, but the energy that is received in the class is so transforming, that I have found my pain decreases and I am in a better emotional state to accept the pain when it is present. I have two of Karena's videos, one for me when I am not able to attend class and another as a gift for a dear friend.  Watching Karena's video is the next best thing to being in the class with her. I am able to feel the same positive healing all accepting energy from Karena in the video as I do when I am in class with her.  Before participating in Kundalini Yoga, I had such a difficult time trying to meditate. However, after doing Kundalini yoga, it is so much easier for me to go inward and connect to my inner self. Thank you Karena!!!!",1448582400,2,1069,4.393939393939394
7363239,5,B013D10G2O,"Karena Virginia gives us the opportunity to learn how our body is our healing and empowering instrument as she welcomes us to recognize our potential and guides us in practice while eliciting awareness in us of cellular health and healing.
As John Gray, renowned author, personal relationship counselor, and health advisor, who was a celibate monk for 12 years, and served as the assistant to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi for 12 years, states  there are health benefits to knowing the reason one takes  any given vitamin supplement. He describes how supplements actually work more effectively if a person taking them is aware of their purpose.  Karena Virginia, a renowned teacher of Kundalini Yoga empowers us as she teaches us the synchronized beauty of cellular and lymphatic healing with physical postures and movement in her yoga practice.  You become simultaneously aware of actively nurturing your inner and outer being.  I have practised Karenas kundalini yoga and feel an inner awareness which I have never before felt on two levels one, of deep relaxation, ethereal lightness and inner tingling throughout my body, and two, of being inspired.
Karena Virginias Power of Kundalini is a transforming and powerful meditation and yoga practice which I believe will change your life.

8727361,3,B013D10G2O,Okay Kundalini yoga but she chatters too much. This yoga is meant to be contemplative so one can focus on inner silence. Ya can't do that when the teacher talks on and on.,1486252800,,171,4.212121212121212
8727362,4,B013D10G2O,"Much better than the Kundalini for your week. Not as mystical, more straight forward. Karena does get into your emotions, but I knew that when I purchased it.
