1085401,5,6305907579,"I really have no idea why I waited so long to buy this, since I saw ""Selena"", I was hooked with the lead actress. Everything she does, she does it to the x-treme with her full potential. This is what shines through on the ""Jennifer Lopez - Feelin' So Good"" DVD.
The disc is done in a documentary/music video collection format, which is interesting (this being the first ""music video"" DVD I have ever purchased), it chronicles many of her memorable performances, such as: ""Let's Get Loud"" at the Womens World Cup' 99 and ""Waiting For Tonight"" at the Billboard Music Awards (the latter, however, has mediocre video quality).
The new 5.1 mix, is at most times enjoyable. As is the easy access to all of her videos and performances that are on the disc through the supplement menu.
Hopefully, a second disc will appear about J.Lo the entertainer, not just the singer. That would be the ultimate DVD!",983836800,4,895,4.635220125786163
1085402,5,6305907579,Jennifer Lopez is SIMPLY FANTASTIC in this video! I highly recommend it!,982886400,,72,5.083333333333333
1085403,4,6305907579,"Fans and critics seem to be divided on the merits and sincerity of Jennifer Lopez' first shot at a music career (specifically, the mixed reaction to her best-selling 1999 debut album ON THE 6).
Granted, Ms. Lopez is hardly on the creative edge of popular music.  Yet to me she has successfully entered the fray with an entertaining brew of Latin/soul/hip-hop, ideally suited to her attractive, better-than-rated vocals and energetic dance style.  Furthermore, in the interviews seen here she seems sincere about where she wants to go with her music--it appears she guides the production staff moreso than vice-versa.  Only time will tell if she's got staying power as a musical performer, but she could probably give up her day job as a talented actress if she wanted to...and continue to land on her feet for some time to come.
The DVD of FEELIN' SO GOOD is a recommended buy for her fans.  On the surface, it's merely the VH1 documentary reconfigured for 5.1 DD sound.  Yet nine complete videoclips (including some remixes) are accessible in a stand-alone manner, and there are additional live performances from various sources, plus other minor extras.  Although some of the tv appearances seem to be lip-sync'd, her dancing prowess is always a visual treat...and a reminder of how fun and entertaining videoclips can be (think of Janet Jackson, Will Smith, and other performers who concoct charismatic, well-choreographed mini-musicals for the cameras).",974160000,11,1457,5.1265822784810124
1085404,5,6305907579,"I saw this on VH1 first and had to get it for my very own! It is a great interview and biography of Jennifer's music. You will see all of her videos from 'On The 6' here - one of the best being the remixed version of 'Waiting for Tonight' which integrates the English and Spanish versions. There is also a rarely seen video of 'Baila', a song she did for the 'Music Of My Heart' soundtrack and import versions of 'On The 6'. Another exciting piece is Jennifer's performance at the Women's World Cup of 'Let's Get Loud'. Jennifer is being interviewed by her sister Linda, which gives ua a little more insight to the real Jennifer Lopez. Being from the same neighboorhood as Jennifer in the Bronx, I enjoyed the footage of where she grew up. If you like Jennifer you will love this dvd!",969926400,13,784,4.340136054421769
1085405,5,6305907579,The Movie was good. I liked it. If you get it I hope you like it too.,962064000,,69,3.1176470588235294
1085464,4,6305907579,"I really enjoyed this DVD because it wasn't just her videos from MTV or anything like that.  There were lots of performances, the interview with her sister which was very down to earth and natural, and behind the scenes stuff from making her album ""On the 6.""  I was a fan of J.Lo already before watching this DVD, but my appreciation for her album went way up after seeing all of the hard work that went into making it.  If you are a fan, you will really enjoy it.  You'll also get to see the early performances that made her famous as a singer that you might have missed.",1055548800,2,573,4.229357798165138
1085465,5,6305907579,"This is actually a really good vid done by my dogg JLo. It proves that JLo can make really good videos that display howsexy she is. This is a good JLo vid that shows all her videos from back in the day that she did for her debut ""On the 6"" which is hot RnB album so pick that up also just like her blazing hott new LP ""This is me... Then"" but this is a really good JLo video and pick it up.",1046304000,,390,3.6547619047619047
1085466,5,6305907579,"This is probably the best music DVD that I have ever watched. Before I bought it I thought that it only had the videos that were on the TV special, which were ""If You Had my Love"". ""Waiting for Tonight (Megamix)"", ""No Me Ames"", ""Baila"", and a clip of ""Feelin' So Good"". Little did I know it has all of these videos & Performances:

 IF YOU HAD MY LOVE - Jennifer's debut, where she looks REALLY hot. The dance break is really good. The internet concept is cool, too. A really good way to start off her music career.
 NO ME AMES (w/ MARC ANTHONY) - A very nice video for a Spanish love song.
 WAITING FOR TONIGHT (ORIGINAL VERSION) - Jennifers famous Millenium video. The special effects are amazing.
 UNA NOCHE MAS - A spanish version of the original ""Waiting For Tonight""
 WAITING FOR TONIGHT (HEX HECTOR REMIX)- I almost fainted when I realized that this was on here. THIS IS MY FAVORITE J.Lo VIDEO EVER!!! I LOVE THIS REMIX AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE EVEN BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The video brings the remix to life. This video is worth the price alone.
 WAITING FOR TONIGHT (MEGAMIX) - It starts off as a spanglish version, then it goes into the remix at the end.
 BAILA - This is a video that wasn't released on TV, and it is from the ""Music of the Heart"" soundtrack. Jennifer looks like a pure latina in the video!!
 IF YOU HAD MY LOVE [DARKCHILD REMIX] - The video is the same as the original, but with the Darkchild remix dubbed over it instead. The dancebreak is the esact same music. The remix is cool, too.
 FEELIN' SO GOOD - This is one of J.Lo's BEST videos. It shows her in her hometown in the Bronx, and she is just around town with her friends. The dance break is really hot!!

 The Performances:
 IF YOU HAD MY LOVE (BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE AWARDS) - This is the best performance on here!! The dancing is amazing, and she actually does the dancebreak live!!
 IF YOU HAD MY LOVE (DARKCHILD REMIX - VH1 FASHION AWARDS) - This is a pretty good performance, but not one of my favs.
 LET'S GET LOUD (WOMAN'S WORLD CUP FINALS) - I like this performance because J.Lo is really energetic in this one. The song is really good.
 WAITING FOR TONIGHT (HEX HECTOR REMIX - 1999 Billboard Awards) - I actually recorded this performance when it was on LIVE TV in December 1999. It is really cool, alost like a recreation of the video.

 This DVD also has:
 -A really, really good interview with J.lo's sister Lynda that discusses the making of ""On the 6"", 1999: J.Lo's year, her first #1, her awesome music videos, and her music career in general.
 -A photo gallery, with some really hot pictures of Jennifer.
 -A press kit, that shows jennifer talking about her album again, and her music career.
 -Behind the scenes at Jennifers Photo shoot.
 -A really interesting biography.

 Personally, I think that ""On the 6"" will always be Jennifer's best album. This DVD goes perfect with it. If you are a Jennifer Lopez fan, I really REALLY reccomend that you get this DVD., because it is definetely worth the money!!",1036195200,12,3007,4.453382084095064

1085468,4,6305907579,"This DVD is an absolute must from a fan's point of view. The ideas are great, and the songs are fabulous. A very nice mix of music and extra's. I enjoyed the additional information and the way it was presented, but I had some issues with the recording quality. At start-up the sound level is way-way over the normal volume level, so be sure to lower your volume before you put this DVD in; don't worry the actual content is recorded at the ""normal"" volume level. There also seems to be a very noticeable difference in quality between the various sound mixes on the disc. Example: The ""No me ames"" track sounds very clean and transparent while the ""Waiting for tonight"" Remix track sounds so processed I can really only enjoy the great video. Too bad for the sound ... it could've been the perfect demo music DVD.",1014163200,,812,4.493243243243243
1085469,5,6305907579,"My opinion of J.Lo as an entertainer rose significantly after watching her television performance specials during the 2001-2002 holiday season.  Impressive.  Since purchasing this disc, I'm hoping that the ""Let's Get Loud"" tour will also show up on DVD.
Virtually everything on this disc is from 1999, the same year that she made it big on the music scene with her ""On the 6"" CD.  Six songs are featured:  ""If You Had My Love,"" ""Waiting for Tonight,"" ""No Me Ames,"" ""Feelin' So Good,"" ""Let's Get Loud,"" and ""Baila.""  What's really cool from a collector's standpoint is that there are multiple versions of several songs (e.g., video, awards show performance, and remix/megamix video), which enhances the documentary aspect of the DVD.  The introduction to each video presents entertaining insight into the concepts, characters and production that created what you saw on MTV/VH1.  In between the music chapters are some informative conversations with Jennifer (as interviewed by her sister), her choreographer, other musical artists and various people associated with her career.  The blend of performance and conversation makes for a well-balanced portrayal of J.Lo as the talented, personable artist that she is.  The only negatives were technical in nature:  a couple of digital glitches between chapters and a poor source recording from the 1999 Billboard Music Awards.
The DVD's bonus features were a nice surprise:  behind the scenes photo shoot, biography, photo gallery, and addional commentary by Jennifer.  Also, there's a great chapter menu with video excerpts to remind you of the scene (great idea!).
If you're a J.Lo fan, just buy this.  If not, buy it anyway, and become one.",1013731200,2,1688,5.230483271375465
1085470,4,6305907579,"I strongly recommend this one if you're Jennifer Lopez fan, especially if you love her music. This is an excellent video package that goes along with her debut On The 6, which features the videos, close and personal interviews and footage of her, and her family, friends, and other people she's worked with, the best performances, and just about everything else involved with promoting the album and other relevant work up until her sophomore album J.Lo. I hope there's another video release featuring the J.Lo videos. (""Love Don't Cost A Thing"", ""Play"", ""I'm Real"", ""I'm Real"" Murder Remix featuring Ja Rule, and ""Ain't It Funny"".) Ever since I watched this, I've been looking for the hot remixes featured in ""Feelin' So Good"". I'm not giving this product a complete 5, because it was ALMOST perfect; they forgot to include the original version of ""Waiting For Tonight"", they only showed the special edit. Both versions should have been included if this was supposed to be a complete package.

7897064,3,6305907579,"Jennifer Lopez's debut video single ""If You Had My Love,"" featured prominently on this DVD, is pretty good, but the video concept it a little mature for some folks.
