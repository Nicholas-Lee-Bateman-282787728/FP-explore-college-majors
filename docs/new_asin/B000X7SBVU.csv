2999024,2,B000X7SBVU,"Like the other reviewers, I think the major problem with this movie is the fact that it is in public domain, (like No, NO, Nanette) and both prints have been allowed to deteriorate until they are close to unwatchable.  I have greater than average tolerance for print flaws but this movie pushes me close to the edge.  I will also grant that the movie itself, even if the print were perfect, is not a remarkable one but Anna Neagle is always worth watching  and has a wonderful supporting cast.  The price for this DVD is unreasonably high, considering the wretched quality of the print.",1243728000,2,586,4.605769230769231
2999025,1,B000X7SBVU,"I had heard references to Marilyn Miller in Sunny, and when I stumbled across this DVD, I thought that it might be interesting to see what the 1920's star was like. Mistake. Although the Amazon site lists Marilyn Miller as being in the film, she most definitely is not - it was made three years after her death. The back of the DVD box says something about ""This is a second version of the film starring Marilyn Miller."" Ambiguous and misleading.
What you get is a terrible DVD. There are no extras - not even anything written on the box other than the misleading back. The visual quality of the film (in black and white despite the cover) is appalling. It looks like something someone filmed as it played on a television - and not a good one.
Anna Neagle (mostly of British fame)is Sunny a singer in a southern circus who occasionally slips into her native accent. During Mardi Gras, some lox whose name I have deservedly forgotten falls for her - but she is a circus girl and he is rich. There is - literally - a lot of running around through the same Mardi Gras crowd, before the rich guy can catch Sunny, who has, for no discernible reason, run away from him after they meet and ""spoon"". He takes her home to the family manse. He has an ogre of an aunt who dominates the family and who almost immediately befriends Sunny. (Most of the cast just stands around. Ray Bolger at his worst does a couple of short dances. Edward Everett Horton, looking more depressed than usual, sits around.)Sunny decides she won't fit in when the clueless circus people arrive in costume, and she runs off. The lox catches her on a river paddle boat, and the aunt, who for some reason is steering the boat, declares she can marry the not so young lovers.
By the way this is a musical, but the one song of any note (no pun intended) is ""Who"" which is never really fully presented. There is some humming by the silhouettes of (lord forgive me) darkies. One black character has a line - ""Mammy"" gets to say something like ""Yazzuh.""
The sound quality is crummy, and it is hard to see what's going on at times.
This movie would be instantly forgettable if it weren't so notably bad. It lingers like the aroma of bad eggs.",1228003200,4,2199,4.405405405405405
2999026,1,B000X7SBVU,"One of the three superstars of British musicals from the 30's through the 50's(along with Jessie Matthews and Gracie Fields), Anna Neagle, came to Hollywood briefly. She and her producer husband Herbert Wilcox remade three old Broadway titles in the 1940's, ""No, No Nanette"", ""Irene"", and ""Sunny"".  None of these were particularly successful in the US, turning out rather dowdy and old fashioned.  Still, they are of interest to die-hard musical fans if only to see how gracefully Miss Neagle danced.  This DVD, unfortunately is of very poor quality.  My previous recording on VHS I took from television was of considerably better quality.  Personally, I'd save my money and watch out for a legit British release of her real classics.  This version is not even worth taking up space to dust.",1205884800,,791,5.0

8227219,3,B000X7SBVU,"Being an Anna Neagle fan, I wanted to see what this film contained. A fairly silly plot, but what musical is serious?  Certainly the circus mob and consequences at what was to be the wedding, was over the top,  Many of the crowd scenes are rather dark and difficult to really see the detail. However, for all of this, the dancing, and songs are lovely and seeing the incredibly double-jointed Ray Bolger dancing and doing his ""moves"" is a joy. Anna Neagle is always a delight to me, although the dialogue and plot here don't give much for her to work with!",1483142400,,556,4.4411764705882355

8227224,3,B000X7SBVU,Bolger's first role after Wizard of Oz is the second remake of a Jerome Kern smash from the 20's although little remains from that show but the songs.  Showcase for Bolger's novelty dancing but not much else.  Anna Neagle is very good but the plot is creaky and overly predictable.,1405900800,,281,4.6

8227228,3,B000X7SBVU,"All Editorial Review Product Descriptions for RCE's red box discs are a c&p text that includes their ""100 greatest classic films of all time"" blurb. These mostly obscure works are hardly as advertised. Also, picture and sound quality depend on condition of unrestored source material. Good to fair is about average.

The musical comedy SUNNY (1941) is set in New Orleans during the final hours of Mardi Gras. This second remake of the stageplay (with music by Jerome Kern and libretto by Oscar Hammerstein II and Otto Harbach) stars Anna Neagle, John Carroll, Ray Bolger (in his first film since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-WIZARD-OF-OZ/dp/B002DYYGQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE WIZARD OF OZ</a>) and Edward Everett Horton.

The original 1925 Broadway version (Kern's first collaboration with Hammerstein) which ran for 517 performances was his follow-up to ""Sally."" The Broadway cast included Marilyn Miller, Clifton Webb, Cliff Edwards (aka Ukulele Ike and Jiminy Cricket) and Pert Kelton (Marian's Irish mother in Meredith Willson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MUSIC-MAN/dp/B00000F14B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MUSIC MAN</a>).

The play's best-remembered song is ""Who"" (stole my heart away, who etc.)

A most amusing sequence in this rather dated film is Edward Horton's several attempts to get an officious waiter to serve him a bowl of turtle soup. Each time, a plate of breaded oysters on the half shell arrives, much to Horton's frustration.",1289520000,,1558,6.232558139534884
