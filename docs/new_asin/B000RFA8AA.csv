8479160,5,B000RFA8AA,"I especially enjoyed this DVD more than ""Union Pacific's Turbines of the Wasatch"" in the respect that this film contained more detail and covered more of the operations involved with these trains.  I loved the bonus film roll of GE and UP's development of the first steam electric turbine in the 1930's. The DVD is well organized, starting with a b/w film of the first  steam turbine and progressing through each model up to the 8500 horse power A/B units.  The film documents filling the unit with sand, water, and fuel, switching the units, turbine start-up and shut-down.  If your into raw power, this DVD is for you!",1352160000,,620,4.712962962962963
