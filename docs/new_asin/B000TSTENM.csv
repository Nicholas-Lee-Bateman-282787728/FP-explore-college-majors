8210749,3,B000TSTENM,"I don't know what it is but some people think it if you throw in a little cold and snow you all of sudden have a christmas theme related show . there were probably two shows in the sets one was a scooby doo and the daffy duck cartoon  called ""bah humduck"" that actually had christmas theme to them . none of the the tom and jerry cartoons were really christmas related themes other than the had snow in them and a cold weather feeling. so I will give it a 3 because for the price it wasn't bad .I'm a big fan of cartoons even though I got this for my daughter for us to watch together during the holiday season.",1229904000,20,611,4.008196721311475
8210750,3,B000TSTENM,"Everytime I did a search for Yogi's first christmas it brought me to this title. Upon reading the reviews no one was helpful enough to include what it actually did contain other than the obvious from the front picture. So this set includes 3 dvd's: One contains a compilation of Scooby Doo mysteries from old to really old that revolve around Christmas or just winter in general. Another is the WB cartoon Bah Humduck which is the Christmas Carol as done by the Warner Brothers crew...Daffy Duck etc. Lastly is a compilation of Christmas or winter Tom & Jerry cartoons.

The only one that we have watched all the way through is the Scooby Doo since we are not big fans of the other characters. The overally quality and packaging is good so if you are into these guys then this DVD is for you.",1229904000,72,792,4.462068965517242
8210751,4,B000TSTENM,"This Christmas collection contains memorable cartoon characters displaying their best for the Holiday Season.  It's entertaining, simple for children  to follow and brings back pleasant memories of my favorite cartoon characters.",1202428800,10,229,6.354838709677419
