7339744,3,B011PS4YGQ,"4 & 5 star films but before you stampede over to get this set you might want to consider several factors. --- I posted these pic quality compression concerns in discuss topic forum below. --- As I stated there ..... Why not on Blu Ray ? .... Especially important when cramming multiple movies on a single dvd disc. --- I have the original Budd Boeticher set which is each movie on it's own disc AND you get the awesome commentaries by Clint Eastwood & others. --- This is big !..... Now I was very Happy with Mill Creeks Blu Ray of ""Lady from Shanghai"" ....All be it a bare bones release very nice pic quality in High Def for a super cheap price. --- Here with this Randolph Scott Roundup of 6 films to cram & compress 3 movies to each disc and be in only Reg Def is NOT good news but rather all the worst. --- So while I applaud the idea of the release for a super cheap price I'd wait for the pic quality/ audio reviews to roll in for awhile AND  for a blu ray release of this package as it should be worlds better and worth the extra bucks spent to acquire it even though 98% probability it won't be coming with the fantastic special features of the original pressed discs set. ---- Hopes this helps you out.",1441324800,31,1211,4.1752136752136755
7339745,5,B011PS4YGQ,"Randolph Scott Round-Up - Volume One  (unmarked) - 6 films on two DVDs:

Unbelievable bargain! Sony apparently has licensed Mill Creek to release these Randolph Scott classics at a *fraction* of the previously issued and largely unavailable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Films-of-Budd-Boetticher/dp/B001ER4CNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Films of Budd Boetticher</a>. Why Sony choose that title remains a mystery. Budd Boetticher is great but so is Randolph Scott -- the star of these films -- and his name is *nowhere* mentioned on that set's cover. The marketing department fell flat on its face with that one -- big time. And Sony wonders why it didn't sell like hotcakes. Still, I'm lucky to own a copy. Deluxe-looking gatefold aside, each film has its own disc but poor casing design double stacks discs so half the time you must take a disc out to get to the other and do it without scratching or breaking the disc. That, and, well, the set was overpriced. Sorry Sony. Marvelous films, bad marketing.

Better marketing came next. All these titles were subsequently made available through Warner Archive -- a stellar resource for hard-to-find WB titles and select Sony titles as well. They used poster art for the covers that actually included Scott's name. But most people are not aware WAC exists and that WB carries select Sony titles. With this release those individual titles have disappeared, at least that's the case as I write this.

Now, Mill Creek has a license to sell these the way Sony should have in the first place -- emphasizing the star of these films with a clear indication of the genre. As I write this I don't know if any of the bonus features from the previous releases will be ported over. Based on the Harryhausen Mill Creek set, I'm guessing not. And if not, and if you want the bonus features, then the individual titles are available here on Amazon.

These Randolph Scott films range from good to stellar with ""The Tall T"" and ""Ride Lonesome"" among Scott's finest films. Most highly recommended!

These films, and most especially ""7 Men from Now"" and ""Ride the High Country"", need to be remastered from the original camera negative onto Blu-ray !!!!!

Having inserted the two discs of this set I can confirm my initial speculation -- this is indeed a very bare bones set.

Columbia/Sony/Mill Creek has spared NO expense on the transfers -- there are NO extras, NO subtitles/captions, NO language options, NO chapter stops, NO liner notes, NO nothing besides the films. At least we have the films at a most reasonable price -- but I would gladly pay a premium for fresh, higher quality scans and restorative work.

Image quality appears the same as the Budd Boetticher set -- which is good, plus ""A Lawless Street"" -- which is not so good. Good grief -- some of these were ""Color by Technicolor"" when those words actually meant the finest and most accurate color and image quality available! There is substantial room for image improvement all around. These films *deserve* to be remastered from the original camera negatives, or tri-color separations, and released on Blu-ray. ""A Lawless Street"" looks marginally better than VHS. The other five films look *substantially* better.  The back cover indicates ""Anamorphic"".

Audio quality is clean mono with dialog never buried in the mix. Subtitles are missed.

Menu is bare bones. At least the typeface varies between film titles. Click on a title and the film begins.

Packaging. The cover front and back are very good. The cover is attractive and highlights the fact that the star of these films is Randolph Scott. The back cover has thumbnails of the original posters that were used on the American posters and individual Sony-release DVDs. The discs themselves are black-labeled with undersized film titles and an undersized Columbia logo -- topped by an ill-placed Mill Creek ad at the top of each disc.

Film selection. I think Mill Creek would have been better off replicating the Boetticher set (and including his name on the cover). These Scott/Brown/Boetticher/Kennedy films are in a class by themselves -- top notch. A separate Scott/Columbia, including ""A Lawless Street"", would be in order as a separate release.

Final thoughts. Despite my complaints, this is an outstanding set at a great price. I'm glad to have it until Columbia/Sony does it right on Blu-ray.

Other familiar faces in the remaining movies are Skip Homeier, Craig Stevens, and Claude Aikens.  This collection, as others have stated, is bare bones:  two discs with 3 films on each.

7339858,3,B011PS4YGQ,I got hooked on Scott's westerns quite recently thanks to the many channels I receive. I really enjoy his characterizations of the man in the saddle.  Bought this particular collection because I had not seen most of them before. I watched Decision at Sundown last night and was surprised at the outcome. He really had to think about the decision he had made so the movie has become one of my favorites. I gave the collection only three stars because  some of the films are ones I probably won't watch too often. I have another collection in my cart for a future purchase.,1461283200,,571,4.533980582524272

There a re a couple of movies in here that make it worth the price, so if you like westerns...I'd say check it out.",1456531200,3,342,4.104477611940299

7339932,4,B011PS4YGQ,"If you like Westerns, you'll like these.  They aren't ""great"" Westerns like Stagecoach, Shane, High Noon, The Searchers, Ride the High Country or Unforgiven.  They are modest, 78 minute, low budget Westerns.
But they are well-written, directed and acted, and some of them will stick.  After you've watched these, you'll agree that Randolph Scott was one of the great Western actors!
Personally, I liked the last three the best.  Buchanan Rides Alone was entertaining.  Ride Lonesome was memorable. But Commanche Station was outstanding!
5 of these films were previously available as ""The Films of Budd Boetticher"" for $79.  Of course, that collection had ""extras.""  But if you  just want to see the films, if the ""extras"" are just ""extras"" to you, this is a deal!  Absolutely!  Positively!  You won't be disappointed.",1446854400,13,817,5.1603053435114505
