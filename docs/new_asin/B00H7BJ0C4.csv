6135782,5,B00H7BJ0C4,"I have loved this movie since watching it with my late sister in the 1990s on VHS.  I am so happy they have finally put this movie out on DVD.  There are some scary scenes in this movie like the scene with the dog in the cargo hold but there are plenty of unintentionally funny scenes.  I can't decide if the funny parts were because of the writing, old time special effects, or acting but they are pretty awesome like the scene where the little girls's doll spews green slime.  This movie is not for everyone but if you like the ""so bad it's good"" kind of old horror movies then this ones for you.",1388275200,27,598,4.173913043478261

6135797,3,B00H7BJ0C4,"BOTTOM LINE: This TV scare flick is fun and it's always cool to see a bunch of TV heroes doing something other than the roles they're most known for. 4 STARS for the film, minus 1 STAR for the optical eyesores the strobing video effect causes.

THE STORY: Rich architect is having pieces of a recently demolished British Abbey flown to New York. The handful of passengers & flight crew quickly find themselves in the deadly grip of an ancient evil power contained within the remains, one which threatens to kill them all.

THOUGHTS: Made-for-TV movie filmed during the ""golden era"" of that genre, standing proudly among such fare as THE NIGHT STALKER, THE NORLISS TAPES, DRACULA, SCREAM OF THE WOLF, SNOWBEAST, DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK and others. An great cast of TV stars fill the roster. The chills are fairly decent and the plot rolls along quickly. There are some problems with the script but nothing to interfere with the thrills too much. Be warned: Chuck Conners & William Shatner are onboard, so some overacting is to be expected. LOL. Still, the film is a good, bumpy, gore-free way to kill 75 minutes on a crummy afternoon or evening when you're stuck at home.

THE DVD: Paramount released this thing, so I cannot understand why it looks so wonky. 95% of the runtime the film looks like stop motion animation or those old NASA moonlanding films; a maddening, strobing effect. Perhaps it is just my copy, but I doubt it. I have several dozen older and newer DVD's I spin on my basic, no-frills Blu-ray machine and they all play with zero issues. I don't know why this one is problematic. I suspect a sub-par transfer, but who knows? You have been warned! Otherwise, it's about typical for a barebones DVD. Some pixelation & artifacting that upscaling on a Blu-ray player cannot hide. I got this used for cheap so I really can't complain too much.",1451433600,2,1859,4.644376899696049

6135800,4,B00H7BJ0C4,"Nearly ten years before ""Alien"" and ""Poltergeist"" would hit the silver screen, this little chiller hit our TV sets during 1973.  I saw this when I was about five years old and let met tell you-it scared the living daylights out of me and I even remember having nightmares that very night after watching it.  The cricket sounding creature was terrifying enough (even though it has been used in numerous films, including a Vincent Price flick).  However, the sound that I feel, and surprisingly no review has yet mentioned this, was the most terrifying was the creature that sounded like a sound wave that started terrifyingly low and then just kept getting higher and higher until you wanted to just cringe, like hearing fingernails on a chalkboard.  This creature to me, although invisible, was THE character that did the best job out of this whole flick and really gave the film the chilling atmosphere that it needed.  Also, what really added to the atmosphere of this movie was scene where the passengers had a fire going to ward off the invisible creatures.  There was nothing but darkness behind the fire and the passengers and there was just something extra creepy about how this was done, leaving the viewer wondering what could come out that darkness.  A shadowy hand of the creature? Absolutely superb atmosphere, to say the least.
Where this film went horribly wrong was the ending.  One of the most dissatisfying ending in all of cinematic history, in my opinion.  William Shatner rounds the corner and, low and behold--a hooded figure!  I'm sorry, but that was no hooded figure that was trying to break out of that metal cargo crate toward the beginning.  One would think that the creature that old B Shatner was going to run into would be very similar looking to the creature from ""Alien"" and dripping with the brown ooze that was so prevalent in this  film.  But, a hooded figure?  C'mon.  This, along with the really corny acting toward the end was what nearly sank this film.  It's as if they started out with a huge budget, but then ran out of money as they were making the film, very much like with happened with another seventies flick, ""Damnation Alley"".  A superb start, but a god awful finish.

Still, despite the hugely disappointing ending, this film is still worth a viewing for the terrifying sounds and creepy atmosphere.  Also, it is a neat little time capsule loaded with tacky-looking seventies fashions.",1443484800,,2434,4.793764988009593

6135803,2,B00H7BJ0C4,"On a rainy Saturday afternoon I watched this movie. The action, story and characters in this movie were painfully slow and ever so predictable.

Expect your money's worth of histrionics from a generally competent cast, particularly Mr Shatner.  As to the premise, I imagine that pitch promised the excitement of Airport, the chills of the Exorcist plus the human interest of the Poseidon Adventure.  And to this then-12 year old, it certainly delivered, and was quite the talk of the Jr High School the next day.

This is a prime example of the Golden Age of TV movie fantasy, the other memorable examples being ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark,"" ""Killdozer,"" and of course ""Trilogy of Terror.""

6135822,5,B00H7BJ0C4,"Just finished watching ""The Horror At 37,000 Feet.""
""The Horror At 37,000 Feet"" is an intense psychological horror movie that first aired back in 1973 as an original made for television movie on CBS; and perhaps is shinning example of why all fright fests don't have to be of blood and gore to be truly edge-on-your-seat terrifying.
The premise behind ""The Horror At 37,000 Feet"" is simple:  Careful what you disturb and dig up - in this case an altar from an ancient family abbey that was originally used for black magic rituals, including human sacrifice.
In an attempt to make his wife happy, a rather wealthy architect, has the altar dismantled from her family estates to be flown back to stateside to be incorporated into their new mansion.  The altar has been packed up and loaded in a special airplane container designed to keep it safe for the flight.
The flight seems to be routine, until the altar's demon decides its time to come out of the container - and here what makes ""The Horror At 37,000 Feet"" a great horror movie - the unseen demon uses cold to kill his victims by freezing them to death - while at the same time, tormenting the architect's wife demanding that she becomes a willing sacrifice to him by whispering in her ear.
The demon has also trapped the plane in a windy vortex at the pilots can't descend out of.
Passengers in the plane have an unlikely chance to escape - but the drunken ex-priest [perhaps one of William Shatner's greatest roles as an actor] doesn't want to get involved until he has a chance to prove the existence of G_D by trying to get a glimpse of the demon.
The passengers do try to trick the demon with a faux human sacrifice - in this case a young girl's doll hastily made up to look like a tart.  Spoiler Alert - demon's don't like plastic stand-ins.
There is also a heart breaking moment in this movie when the young girl makes a personal sacrifice to buy herself and everyone else on the plane a few more minutes of life.
Do watch this movie if you get the opportunity!
Highly Recommended!

6135826,5,B00H7BJ0C4,"Worth watching multiple times for the Father Bill T. Shatner (KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS, THE DEVIL'S RAIN) death scene alone, HORROR AT 37,000 FEET was a long-awaited DVD release (at least by me). Imagine a passenger plane filled w/ future guest stars of FANTASY ISLAND and THE LOVE BOAT, piloted by Chuck ""The Rifleman"" Connors (SOYLENT GREEN, TOURIST TRAP) and Russell ""The Professor"" Johnson (THIS ISLAND EARTH, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, SPACE CHILDREN, ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS)! Throw in Paul Winfield (THE TERMINATOR, THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW) as a friendly doctor, and Buddy ""Uncle Jed / Barnaby Jones"" Ebsen (SMASH-UP ON INTERSTATE 5) as a cranky zillionaire, and we're off! Now, combine this w/ an ancient, ""haunted-by-eeevil-spirits"" church abbey in the cargo hold, and you've got pure, 70's-made-for-TV-cheeeze magic! The special FX highlight comes whenever the airplane is shown ""flying"" along, as it is obviously about nine inches long! It doesn't take long for the spooks to start flying and the excitement to explode! While at no time does anything even remotely frightening happen in this movie, it still possesses an irresistible, cheddar-y charm. Listen for the demonic voices and the world's funniest possession scene! Thrill to the ultra-daffy, sacrificial doll sequence! ""The Shat"" excels in his role as the histrionic cleric, reminiscent of his old TWILIGHT ZONE airplane ride!

6135828,5,B00H7BJ0C4,"A very good early 1970's made-for-television horror film.  An ancient druid alter stone is being transported on a transatlantic flight.  Little does anyone realize that the stone has a lot of dormant evil spirits that now wake up, angry that they've been uprooted from their native soil.  Now, in flight, the ancient ghouls put the few passengers and crew in mortal danger.  In order to survive the passengers become a mob and start resorting to barbarism.  At times truly creepy.  Everyone is pretty good but Tammy Grimes is great as an expert on the stone who starts becoming somewhat possessed by the bad vibes.  What is with Lyn Loring's cheeks.  They look like they have rosacea.  The stewardesses uniforms are typical for the Playboy era but look ridiculous today.  Ultra miniskirts, go-go boots, and some sort of miners helmet.  The DVD is excellent quality.  Highly recommended.  Now if only they would release some of those other made-for-TV films from that decade, particularly The Cat Creature.",1403395200,4,1005,5.0181818181818185
6135829,5,B00H7BJ0C4,"Since this was a made-for-television horror flick, complete with blackouts where the commercials used to be, the hoped for fright is a bit on the tepid side of nothing.  Try as they did to jazz things up with heightened performances by all the actors involved, there still wasn't much horror to hang their hats on.  The slow boil approach to things didn't serve them well.  But then, this was a product of 1973 when ""suggestion"" played a greater part in the way horror was handled, especially on TV.  Still, as watered down as this was, it still holds a certain fascination as an exercise of mob rule.  The plot involves an architect (Roy Thinnes) transporting an abbey altar to the US.  Only one passenger seems aware of its untoward nature (Tammy Grimes); she loves baiting the other passengers with portents of danger.  Beware-beware, the altar.  ""You'll regret it.  That's all I'm going to say.""  It's midsummer's eve.  ""You're the sacrifice they demand.""

They used FX sparingly, instant ice/thaw, some oozing green slime, a little mold here and there, the sound of wind inside the plane, and a strange sci-fi noise emanating from nowhere and everywhere.  Since they were low on passengers to begin with, there's not much of a body count.  You know you're in dire straits when someone faints and starts yapping in Latin.  I like this old chestnut specifically because it is corny and fun; even though at the time it was made, they meant it to be spooky, frightful, and filled with chills.  It's also a hoot watching William Shatner wax cynical, as Buddy Ebsen plays a bad guy, while Tony winning actress Tammy Grimes does her usual shtick as the resident whacko.

6135835,5,B00H7BJ0C4,"I remembered Horror at 37,000 Feet as one of those cheesy Movie of the Week thrillers this one having a horror flair.  The thing that made this movie totally awesome at the time is it was set aboard a Boeing 747 aircraft.  In 1973 the Beoing 747 was a technological marvel of its age.  The 747 had monsterous engines and the plane itself was breath-takingly posh.  I would look at that spiril staircase onbaord the 747 and just marvel at its awesomeness (A passenger airplane with two floors WOW!)

Anyways on this particular beautiful alas ill fated Boeing 747 things were not going so well.  Two of the passengers are so rich they saw a nice object art that was part of a larger building in Europe and brought it home with them stored in the hole of this plane.  The rich American's simply must have this old ruin. So at great expense the artifact is packed away in the large caverous hold of the Boeing 747 taking them home to the good old USA.  Unfortunately this object is some form of alter filled with dark magics, curses and ghoulish stuff like that there. The artifact is infested with you guessed it an evil monster like spirit and yeah its plenty pissed that its home in the United Kingdom is now hurdling through the skies at 650 miles per hour and 37,000 towards the US of A.

As in many low budget movies you never really get to see the monster face to face but you see the ills and havock it wrecks as it almost pulls and shakes this beautiful new Beoing 747 apart. There are odes to other horror movies like ""The Excorcist!"" You must remember this was a movie from 1973 so acting was a bit cardboard like. The retro clothing and hair styles would put an Old Navy to shame. Special effects were ok but not stealar. Movie of the Week Budgets were not HUGE.  This movie works best if you the viewer have a furtile and furtive imagination.  If you have a good enough imagination Horror at 37,000 Feet will give you the creeps and keep you creeped out for good.  Horror at 37,000 Feet is so engrained in my psyche that when I see the name BOEING on a place as I enter I always think of this creepy movie.  I remember that despite it all that Boeing 747 plane took a beating and kept flying.

Watching William Shatner ham it up in another acting job is a plus too, I never tire of seeing him.  Since his debut in Twilight Zone as a scared passenger on a plane he was just made for the role.  I honestly don't know what it is about Horror at 37,000 Feet but this is one movie that does not scare me but for some reason Horror at 37,000 Feet gives me a solid case of the outright creeps even today.  Horror at 37,000 Feet is just a little movie of the week type movie but with imagination its a big creepy icky movie. You can't judge Horror at 37,000 Feet too harshly because; its budget was not huge, it was shot on a very tight time schedule. Horror at 37,000 Feet was meant to be a cheap humpday movie thrill all for the price of a few electrons that were bored out of their skulls waiting for you to give them purpose. So watch Horror at 37,000 Feet with fresh buttered popcorn, good beer and with someone who like you loves a good old 1970's era movie to bring back fond memories!",1399248000,12,3193,4.251239669421488

6135837,4,B00H7BJ0C4,"HORROR AT 37,000 FEET can be described as a haunted house on a plane.

Roy Thinnes is one of those greedy, foolish modern men who disdain the supernatural. His wife, Jane Merrow, is from a very old and rich English family, the kind with lots of spooky ancestral stuff on her estate. In her case, a Druid altar.

Thinnes charters a Boeing 747 jumbo jet to fly the altar to the US.

That's right -- an entire 747 just for him and his altar. One of those big double-decker behemoths so common to airplane disaster films. Seems the altar is so heavy, only a big plane can carry it. Odd, that Thinnes was unable to find a cargo jet capable of the job. Nor a ship. But, time is of the essence, for some flimsy reason.

Still, it serves a purpose. If you're gonna do a haunted house film, you can only have a few people, isolated in a dark environment. A 747 is pretty isolated up in the sky, but those jumbo jets normally carry 100+ passengers. That's too crowded for a haunted house. But whereas Thinnes has chartered this passenger jet, he's got it all to himself, his wife, and his altar down in cargo.

Well, there are a few other passengers.

About a dozen people, unrelated to Thinnes, also purchased tickets for the flight. Perhaps the deal was that the airline try and defray Thinnes's cost. Why so few passengers bought tickets for a popular route (London to America) is unexplained, except that it's a ""special flight,"" not one normally scheduled. Maybe no one else planned ahead?

Whatever, it's reason enough to put a dozen or so passengers aboard the otherwise empty plane.... and then the hauntings begin!

You see, removing the altar from its ancestral location has upset the local Druid spirits. Or gods. Or whatever. So that once the plane reaches cruising altitude, it stops, and remains suspended in midair. That's odd. Planes aren't supposed to do that. The crew speculates that they're caught in some ""strange wind"" that's pushing the plane back as far as it's going forward.

Meanwhile, things get spookier!

A stewardess descends an elevator to where they store the crappy food and luggage. (I didn't know planes had elevators, but I guess they do.) It's freezing! She suspects a blowout. So the pilot and navigator go down: Chuck Connors and Russell Johnson (the professor from Gilligan's Island).

And things get even spookier!!!

Someone instantaneously freezes to death, an electrical fire erupts, and green ooze bubbles up from the floor. Most of the passengers initially seek a ""rational explanation"" for a stationary plane with green ooze bubbling from the floor. Later, they turn to voodoo.

One critic called HORROR AT at 37,000 FEET hilarious, and detected the actors suppressing laughter. Yes, it's a silly film, but I didn't laugh. Its effectively spooky atmosphere allows one to suspend disbelief enough to enjoy the film as serious horror ... if one is willing. One must make the effort. It helps to watch it alone, in darkness, away from contagious laughter.

Nor did I detect the actors suppressing smiles. They play it admirably straight, throughout. Apart from Connors and Johnson's square-jawed heroics, there is also Buddy Ebsen as the boorish businessman, bragging about his self-made wealth. Tammy Grimes is delightful as a kooky activist/witch, hounding Thinnes after losing a lawsuit to keep the altar in England, frightening Jane Merrow, and reveling in the prospect of an onflight human sacrifice. (The Druids practiced human sacrifice.)

Paul Winfield plays Dr. Enkalla, the Voice Of Reason. Because he's black, he's noble and erudite, in a Sidney Poitier sort of way. (1970s black actors are usually either jive-talking street hustlers, or virtuous sophisticates.)

William Shatner portrays an alcoholic ex-priest, traveling with a disapproving woman. (Who IS she? -- not his wife or girlfriend, since she chastises him for leaving the priesthood. A nun? She does have short hair and is conservatively dressed.) Shatner overacts, in typical Shatner hamminess, overplaying his drunken cynicism. He'd be annoying, if he weren't so much fun to watch.

You already know the sequence of events. Characters are introduced as they check-in and board. Expository dialogue establishes their broadly-painted personas. At first sign of trouble, the crew tries not to alarm anyone. But when people start dying, and the plane shuddering and belching green slime, the crew finally admit that something's ""not right.""

The cast exchanges their assigned clichs. Witchy Grimes mocks Shatner's Christian God. Shatner smirks and has another drink, under his scowling lady friend's chastisement. Voice Of Reason Winfield provides more foil for Grimes's Druid mysticism. Ebsen boorishly boasts of his god, Money, again reminding everyone how much he has. The pilots tighten their square jaws so as not to alarm passengers. The stewardesses flit about, trying to reassure passengers.

There's also an exotic black model, who mainly just sits around looking exotic. And a ludicrous ""TV cowboy"" star, the most broadly-painted caricature on the plane.

Oh yes, there's a little girl, traveling alone with her dolly. Not really relevant to anything, except for her doll. All 1970s airplane disaster films seem to have some kid flying alone. (Maybe they're what's attracting all this trouble, and should be banned?)

Thinnes insists that his precious altar has not caused the suspended plane, the cold, the green slime. But the passengers grow desperate, and Grimes's suggestion of human sacrifice begins to make sense...

HORROR AT 37,000 FEET is much fun. Watch it alone in the dark if you want scares. Watch it in a bright crowded room if you want laughs.",1398384000,14,6953,5.870168483647175
6135838,4,B00H7BJ0C4,"If you're in to cheesy stories with little to no special effects you can't go wrong with this title.

It has some big time actors for their era's, but the overall story is a basic Sunday mid morning CBS movie. Very safe for those over 13 or so to watch. There are some death scenes, but nothing overly gory.

I would recommend renting before buying if that's an option for you, but I bought my copy and I'm satisfied. Not for everyone, but for those that like a little old school suspense/horror this can't hurt.",1397347200,,512,4.378947368421053

6135840,4,B00H7BJ0C4,"Back in the early 70's til almost the end, TV had a Golden Age of sometimes wacky, sometimes very cool ""Movies of The Week"". The casts were usually between-series ""Name"" ensemble casts, who later wound up on voyages with The Love Boat. No stone was left unturned in terms of a story or subject matter. There were honest gems like ""Gargoyles""(1972) and ""Killdozer""(1974 .We did not have DVDs, VHS and so forth so ANY TV film on any of the Big Three Networks was worth a look and usually did great ratings. This particular film aired in February 1973 on the CBS Tuesday Night Movie, and combined the ""airline-in-trouble"" genre ala AIRPORT with the supernatural added in for extra thrills. In this story, a wealthy architect and his wife have rented out the cargo hold of a 747 from London, to New York, to bring back some ancient ""druid"" altar stones found beneath an old abbey that dated back to the ancestors of the wife, so that they may use them in their new home's garden on Long Island, or something like that. Up front we're told it's a cargo ""X"" flight hence very low passenger roster which gives the story a chance to keep track of the ensemble cast and everyone gets their ""scene"". The cast includes favorite faces like Chuck Connors, Russell Johnson, Roy Thinnes, Tammy Grimes, Buddy Ebsen, Paul Winfield and William Shatner. These films are also good for the yucks you can have with fashions and hair styles and hair pieces of the time.

Strange things begin to happen with an icy wind that traverses the plane during take off preparations, and after take off, an odd headwind starts to increase to keep the plane effectively going no place fast in the sky. Thinnes' wife ""Sheila"" starts hearing voices calling her name on the plane's music headset...and as it turns out, the couple are being stalked by Tammy Grimes' venomous character -who gets creepier and creepier with the use of subtle make-up and lighting- as the film goes on-who has followed them, lights into them every chance she gets about them ""unleashing evil"". In the meantime, something unseen is trying to kick it's way out of the metal cargo box in the hold, and manages to freeze a dog in the process. As things go along, characters start panicking and going at each other and their foibles,addictions and marital problems... and the plane itself starts to take on the feel of a dark, mold-encrusted cave at the back(genuinely disconcerting and creepy). As with all these airline-distress films, there is a child aboard and her doll winds up being used as a ""sacrifice"".  Ooze and mist begin to come up out of the floor and back of the plane. Unfortunately it appears they spent most of the money up front of the film, as it seems to run out of gas to try and quickly tie things up as they did in these made for TV'ers. Anyway, it is a goofy, fun film, yet creepy/spooky in many other spots.",1396569600,41,2870,4.603515625
