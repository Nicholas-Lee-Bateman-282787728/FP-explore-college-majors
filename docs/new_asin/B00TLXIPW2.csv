Having invested time in it, I was driven to see it through to the unrealistic end, where the one friend drags her dying friend's wheelchair through the sand and lays her on the beach (in winter) so she can feel the water.  The bad storyline wouldn't allow me to even be sad.  Sorry.  The film was not good..",1524268800,,476,4.488372093023256

8702304,3,B00TLXIPW2,"This movie is quite realistic in following a woman in the last few weeks of her life with cancer.  It is definitely a Christian movie and shows the spiritual growth of the Lena's childhood friend, Jen, from unbelief to belief.  But it is sad and somewhat depressing (deals with spousal abuse, and leaves a lot of loose ends there, without a lot of",1506729600,,347,4.492063492063492
8702305,5,B00TLXIPW2,"This is a emotional story about a woman passing away from cancer and her childhood best friend taking her back to her childhood home.
This movie quotes the Bible and talks of God from start to finish. If you can't or don't want to deal with these things you'll likely not want to watch this movie. If you're a God believing emotion feeling person then this is right up your alley.",1504569600,5,380,4.366197183098592
