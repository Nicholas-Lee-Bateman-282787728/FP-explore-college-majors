1750822,4,B00006FDFF,"I first saw this projected onto a bedsheet on a wall in 1980.  I laughed until tears streamed down my cheeks (mind you I was just 15, and broad humour was considerably more funny to me then).  30 years or so on, I showed it to my 6 year old son on video, and the title song got stuck into his head.  We had to sing it for days afterwards.  The story is simple enough, but the interactions between Hill and Spencer are what make the show (that and the soundtrack).

I also liked the violence.  It is stylized enough that it fits the cartoon violence standard of innocence.  My son certainly appreciated that the bad guys were getting their just desserts, not that I think Hill and Spencer saw the film as a great teacher of life lessons.  This is not a brilliant intellectual comedy, but it is watchable and remains funny, over and over again.

One possible flaw is the love story between Hill's character and a friend's daughter.  It sort of appears, and then disappears without resolution.  This is a mildly irritating loose end in a rather aimless plot, but not a dealbreaker.",1263945600,6,1078,4.448979591836735
1750823,4,B00006FDFF,"I'm laughing just thinking about this movie. You have to have a particular sense of humor, but this movie is a classic Bud Spencer, Terrace Hill adventure. With slow dry situational humor, a environmental protection theme while helping the less fortunate in a quirky sort of way, it's a complete riot.
There is no high definition, and the sound is done on the cheap, but you soon adjust and a great time is had.",1241654400,3,411,4.5675675675675675

Not Trinity but close.
P.S.
Trinity was five star.",1230249600,2,103,4.473684210526316
1750825,5,B00006FDFF,"Here they go again! This time in Africa and as usual one brother is looking out for the under""dogs"" while the other ends up towing the line against the bad guys. Overall very entertaining with the usual slapstick moments and ridiculous senarious. A must for collectors (like us).Great scenic moments (this isn't the digital era) and the wildlife is gorgeous. A happy funny movie!",1223683200,3,379,4.9375
1750826,5,B00006FDFF,"I bought a copy of this movie a while ago, in the sweedish format, but mine plays in english too.

This is one of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer's better 70s films and I'm glad to see it available in all regions format now.  In this film they use their real voices, so don't expect the Trinity and Bambino vocal sounds.",1193529600,5,317,4.180327868852459
1750827,4,B00006FDFF,"Amazon will probably get around to fixing this listing, but just in case they don't, I'll post this as a review to get the word out.  I was looking for this movie on DVD anyway, so I was actually glad to get a DVD copy rather than a VHS tape.  This movie is a must-have for any Terence Hill/Bud Spencer fans.  It has always been difficult to locate this film on DVD (even now since Amazon currently has it listed as VHS format).  This is indeed in DVD format from WHAM! the same company that released the DVD copy of ""Watch Out, We're Mad"" (Another great Terence Hill/Bud Spencer film).  ""I'm for the Hippopotamus"" isn't quite up there with ""Watch Out, We're Mad"", but still a good flick nonetheless.",1188345600,9,700,4.395348837209302

1750860,5,B00006FDFF,Oh my god.  These guys are great.  I could watch any thinly veiled excuse (and it is) for Terence Hill and Bud Spencer to beat people up and being lovable and gruff respectively.,1480291200,,178,4.363636363636363

1750868,3,B00006FDFF,"This film starring Terence Hill and Bud Spencer,is a classic comic adventure. Though most of the fight scenes have been seen a dozen times. Overall,it's a bit repetative,but still a classic slapstick film.",1333756800,,205,5.242424242424242
