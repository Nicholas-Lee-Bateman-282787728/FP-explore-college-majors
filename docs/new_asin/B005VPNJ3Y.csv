4897427,4,B005VPNJ3Y,"Apparently WB is listening to the fans... somewhat. After the first three releases that basically ripped customers off with only 4 episodes and no features for 10-15 bucks a piece they have announced the second half of the season will be released in a 2 disc dvd set with the final 14 episodes, Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated Season 1, Part 2. Date is set for January 24th, 2012. I wish they would have released the first half of the season this way or hope they will now. That said there is still something that troubles me.

There is no mention of Blu-ray or of any special features being included, I feel like the fans of this series deserve special features, even basic ones, and there is no reason not to release these in HD. At least the dvd set, if nothing else is released, allows fans to own over three times as many episodes as these volume releases but at only $5 more suggested retail price. The set will be only $19.99 and likely sold on sale by amazon and other retailers. This is a step in the right direction WB and I give credit where credit is due. Hopefully they do something similar if not better with their other series Young Justice.",1320537600,24,1156,4.452830188679245

4897431,5,B005VPNJ3Y,"I am obsessed with this version of Scooby Doo. I love it so much it's difficult to put into words how much and why. To keep it short, let me just say the refrences to pop culture are so vast and fun it's a treat for adults! For. the Shining to Hellraiser to Dungeons and Dragons...it's incredible! I like the overarching plot lines and story that weaves through from the first episode, S1 to s2!! And it just got renewed for S3! Great show!! Oh, and did I mention the original creators of the original Scooby Doo were advised and he,led to create this?! So anyone who says it clashes with the original missed the memo! It goes places that the original writers wanted to go! With Velma and Shaggy dating, and Fred and Daphne too!",1360108800,2,728,4.360294117647059

4897434,5,B005VPNJ3Y,"My 4yo is obsessed with Scooby Doo, so the grown ups around here get tired of watching the same old episodes. We were very pleasantly surprised at how much fun the new series is. The creators of this series are obviously huge fans of the original, but they've put some new twists in. My husband and I laugh out loud at every episode. The plots are interesting and the art is really excellent. The characters expand on the originals but are still true to the originals. It even makes it fun to go back and watch the old episodes to see what inspired this new series. Our whole family sits down for a ""Scooby marathon"" when we get a new Mystery Inc disc.",1353196800,,652,4.308943089430894
4897435,5,B005VPNJ3Y,"Ok I gave this release 5 stars. I did it because the cartoon is sooo good. However, where in the world is the Blu Ray Release?? Ive seen many bootlegs in HD and turned them down to wait on the official release..However, there is still no official blu ray release.!!! Come on Warner Brothers, give fans what they want! HD Versions on Blu Ray!!!",1337040000,2,343,4.375
4897436,4,B005VPNJ3Y,"Yep, I was right.  The second half (well, actually, MORE than half) of the first season of ""Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc."" is now on an awesome two-disc set continuing the adventures of Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Velma, and Daphne as they track down the elusive ""Mr. E"" as well as a mysterious treasure and solve other strange things going on in the town of Crystal Cove.  These 14 episodes include the following:

""When the Cicada Calls"" - A huge infestation of insects is targeting a factory that makes one of Shaggy and Scooby's favorite treats (and they're not Scooby Snacks, thank goodness).

""Mystery Solvers State Club Finals"" - Scooby is feeling sick as a dog and has a fever dream that has him and the gang in the style that they were originally created.  But only Scooby, along with other familiar faces Jabberjaw, Speed Buggy, Captain Caveman, and the Funky Phantom must track down their lost teammates before it's too late.

""Escape from Mystery Manor"" - The gang head to the infamous Darrow family mansion to investigate any info of the original Mystery Inc. gang.  Getting in is one thing, but getting out is another.

""The Siren's Song"" - A lone Velma attempts to investigate a mystery herself, but gains an unusual ally: a mermaid.

""A Haunting in Crystal Cove"" - Fred's dad Mayor Jones is in possession of an important item that may be behind the Crystal Cove curse.  But someone or something may be after it as well.

""All Fear the Freak"" - It's the epic finale where not only the trail of the hidden treasure is revealed, but also some startling truths and the big breakup of the gang.  Trust me, you will never be the same as the way they felt.

Well, all I can say is that I hope season 2 will end up better than the first.  So I'll just have to keep an eye on Cartoon Network for new episodes real soon.",1329696000,15,1814,4.507645259938838

8487543,5,B005VPNJ3Y,"love the reboot of the series. Want season 3. The subtle homages to movies like Chevy Chase's vacation movies,  past Scooby Doo bad guys.",1369267200,,137,4.708333333333333
8487544,4,B005VPNJ3Y,"Having grown up on the original series, I was more than a little skeptical about this reboot, as this cast had only Fred from the original series.  In this SD universe, we get most of the gang from ""What's New, Scooby Doo?"" minus the ultimate, the original  Shaggy of Casey Kasem.  As much as I have put off watching non-CK Scooby, this voice team is tight and you only notice Shaggy is different rarely, which is an enormous KUDO to the new Shaggy, Matthew Lillard.  Additionally, the sheer number of top list guest star vocals is very impressive.  Gary Cole alone is a total jewel as Fred's dad.  Vivica Fox is a national treasure as Angel Dynamite.

That the story lines actually carry an arc from episode to episode is the biggest upgrade in cartoon production for SD series yet.  It keeps the show interesting and my 5 year old likes that something from an old episode still has meaning in the next one.  She feels she ""knows"" the gang better.

On the whole, this incarnation is even better than hoped for and I, for one, am more than a little angry that WB has made the ill-advised decision to cut production and run after only 2 seasons.  Just one more executive blunder in an ocean of stupidity for WB, another really interesting, well-made HB studio product for history.  Someone in WB corporate should be dressed in sack cloth and left to die on the back alleys of Hollywood.",1364342400,2,1385,4.518072289156627
8487545,3,B005VPNJ3Y,"I don't have this DVD set, but I have seen all the episodes. I thought it would be fair to warn customers here that this is not your typical kid-friendly Scooby-Doo cartoon. It contains high levels of violence (like ""Itchy and Scratchy"" but with less blood), mild visible gore, implied death, very ominous villains (some scarier than the ""Zombie Island"" villains) that are geared toward death and destruction instead of just ""scaring everybody away,"" almost every episode has at least one thing blowing up, and there are also quite a few adult/sexual innuendos at times. One really does have to wonder how this show managed to get a TV-Y7-FV rating (especially considering how Cartoon Network/Boomerang once made the same mistake when they reran the 1972 primetime animated series ""Wait Till Your Father Gets Home,"" giving it a TV-Y7 rating despite containing quite a bit of PG content!)

In ""Escape from Mystery Manor,"" the villain tries to murder the gang, even using a fire poker to try and stab them, all because he thinks the gang is going to steal from him. In ""The Wild Brood,"" an evil ""orc"" steals from a weapon base, fires a missile at a railroad bridge and causes a violent train wreck (obviously it's more of a shout-out of the train wreck scene in ""Back to the Future Part III"", but still.) And in ""Pawn of the Shadows,"" the Mystery Machine appears to be destroyed (though it's actually a trick, and nothing really major to the episode's plot.)
The second season grows more progressively dark and violent as well.

The show, while getting some praise online from several Scooby fans, it's also received its fair share of criticism, and I've even seen some REALLY scathing ""one-star"" reviews on the show as well. They don't just complain about the violence and gore. They complain about how the characters are now portrayed. Fred was initially somewhat his usual recently-bubbly self (ala the fun ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"" and the terrible ""What's New Scooby-Doo"") and has a strange obsession with traps, though he improves greatly in the second season. Velma has become more naive and tends to complain a bit more, and acts a bit more like Judy Funnie from ""Doug"" (but without the beatnik/actress mannerisms.)
There are also some episodes that try to be more like live-action instead of a cartoon, scrapping the use of the old Hanna-Barbera sound effects, etc. The animation is also not so great at times; you can tell that at Warner they would mostly just write the scripts and then ship it off to Korea. And the first season ends on a downer ending (but I'm not going to ruin it for those who haven't seen it!)
However, there are some high points on the series. I do like seeing the gang's family life outside of mysteries, especially Daphne and Velma's. The Fred/Daphne romance is also more well-played here. The gang is also wearing their original outfits again from the 1969 series, with the exception of Velma wearing a couple of bows in her hair now (Daphne seems like the best-designed character in this show.) Matthew Lillard is a worthy replacement voice actor for Shaggy after Casey Kasem's retiring (it's a good thing Scott Menville isn't voicing Shaggy again; he was horrible!) Pretty much everyone gets a moment in the spotlight, unlike ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" and the 2004-2005 made-for-video movies, which focus more on Fred, Daphne and Velma, or the 2007-2009 made-for-video movies that focus more on Scooby and Shaggy (though Scooby himself is actually my favorite character, it seems fair to let it focus on everyone, like the good old days.) The ""Mystery Solver State Club Finals"" was also fun, letting us see the Funky Phantom, Captain Caveman, Speed Buggy and Jabberjaw again (the latter even voiced by Frank Welker, reprising his original role from the 1976 series!)

I would recommend this for the hard-core Scooby fans, or anyone who really enjoys the series. (The second season is quite better than the first, I have to admit.) If you have really young Scooby-Doo fans (like under 10 years old), I would not recommend letting them watch this, unless they can handle ""Anastasia"" (which has similar levels of violence and darkness) or are fine with violence and gore. This show is still definitely not completely little kid-friendly! (Show them the original ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?"" instead. That show can be creepy at times, but at least it teaches them that ""monsters are just pretend!"")",1363824000,2,4428,4.8934753661784285
