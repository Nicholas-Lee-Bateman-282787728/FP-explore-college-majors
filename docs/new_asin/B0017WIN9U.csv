8267663,5,B0017WIN9U,"Yes.  Forget that these film makers did not register the trademark likenesses of its 3 main characters: Santo, Spiderman, and Captain America.  Forget the only version left of this film is from one recorded off a tv broadcast.  This one is strange, and I've seen some strange flicks in my time.  But this is a really good one...

Let's see, Spiderman (in green and red) is menacing Turkey with his go-go dancers and counterfeit money.  Yep, he's a bad guy.  The mob is pissed, so he kills them.  Plus, Spiderman murders a few other people for fun.
Coming to the resuce is Captain America and Santo, who just happen to be vacationing in Turkey or were called.  Yeah, because that's a partnership that makes sense.  But you know what?  Who cares. They track down Spiderman, fight in a dojo, lift up a car, throw down in a graveyard.  Whatever.  It's all cool, man.

Overall, this film is cheap and cheesey.  The action is weird and awkward, but frenetic.  It's brutal at times and senseless, locking in strange elements of comic books and detecitive mystery serials, thrown together with the usual Turkish absurdity. Goddamn, they must have had a blast making this flick...

Throw in a few double crosses and some hot Turkish chicks strutting around, and an ending battle that doesn't seem to stop, you get arguably THE BEST Turkish cinematic gem. Shoot, I enjoyed this puppy on a bootleg with no subtitles.  Now, thanks to Onar films, we can actually see whats going on and that, well, the subtitles don't make too much of a difference.

If you're into to Turkish cinema...get this.  If you're into weird and cult stuff, get this.

If you're one of those art-house goons creeps that love their criterion, beat it, Klaus Von Dorkenstein.",1269820800,10,1735,4.716666666666667
