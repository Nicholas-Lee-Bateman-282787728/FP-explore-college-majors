8162076,5,B000BZN1R8,"I thought this DVD was awesome.  Great underground hip-hop with spectacular old school videos of NBA ballers doin their thing back in high school. My favorite section was the videos of NBA players in high school plaing with elite athletes in other sports like D. McNabb giving a no look pass to Antoine Walker for a dunk or Jason Williams sweet pass to Randy Moss for the throw down.  Definitaly get this DVD, you will love it.",1144540800,,427,4.532467532467533
8162077,5,B000BZN1R8,"The Best Hoop Tape Ever

This could be the best hoop DVD ever.  The music is hot.  The action is unbelievable.  The dudes ballin on 5th avenue and the tricks from Hollywood Hoops is sik. But the best part is seein these guys wen they was in school.  Lebron dribblin OVER people, Nash with a good haircut, Rasheed with a flattop, Kobe, AI,  Jermaine and Flash, the list goes on and on.  Plus Bobbito knows his hoops and him trickin it out is crazy.  I rate this better than One Love 1 and that DVD gets played out all the time on my player...now I mix it up with 1 and 2.

I played in Chicago and seein Imari Sawyer and Q and Magette brought back my school days.

Plus check out Nate Robinson in school.  that dude can ball.

Five stars!",1141776000,2,736,4.105633802816901
