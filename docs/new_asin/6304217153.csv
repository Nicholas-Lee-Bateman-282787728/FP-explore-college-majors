8324429,1,6304217153,"I picked up this film because it was cheap and it said on the back:the wildest schoolyard comedy since Project A ko. The film is not funny, the  ideas are completely done, the characters have no depth, and the so called  ""comedy"" consists of the characters flopping around in front of  the school gate. I usually don't care about the dubbing, as long as the  voice is for the proper gender, but in this movie it stank! The voices were  monotone and the line: ""I want you to stop these people and do  whatever it takes!  could have as well been : Look man servant I have found  lint in my pocket, dispode of it properly. Wow! This movie is bad. It does  not have action, the robots are just vending machines on wheels, and the  ""villian"" is a rich girl that just minds her own bussines and is  polite to everyone.  One would think, if this person hates this  movie so much why are they bothering with a review?  WEll, I don't want  you to fall into the trap of buying this movie because of the price or what  it says on the back. It is badddddddddddddddd.......  reviewers note: is  there a no star rating?",967852800,4,1105,4.281553398058253
8324430,4,6304217153,"Sayaka, president of the Debutante Club at St. Ignatio high school, intends to rule the world. She is so cute and soooooo bad.
Unfortunately for her, Reika and Rie, the two officers [and initially, the only members]  of the Etiquette club, have the power to thwart her plans -- the Battle  Skipper combat vehicles developed by her grandfather.
This anime is a  comedy, however, with heaps of action and destruction thrown in -- along  with ""magical girl"" transformations, power suits, armored  vehicles, mechas, and conspiracy.
As silly as Project A-ko and just as  much fun as the superhero parody ""Moldiver"", it may  not break  new ground but is loads of fun, nonetheless.
Attractive character designs  and a colorful animation style make this one definitely eye candy. There's  even a hint of a Sohryuden dragon, in my mind anyway, in a cameo role. And  Sayaka's toady, Todou [heh] is such an inept bungler.
Saori, one of the  new students who joins the Etiquette Club, sports the weirdest hair style  perhaps in all anime. LOL. The other characters have their own quirks,  including the Artificial Intellegence of the Battle Skipper vehicles.
My  only disappointment is that the series consists of only 3 videos.",963187200,5,1216,4.980099502487562
