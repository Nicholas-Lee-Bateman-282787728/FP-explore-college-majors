8512408,3,B0078V62I8,"All my life I loved Hedy Lamarr.  The book does give the history of her life.  But after coming to Hollywood, the story gets too detailed and boring.  I still have not completely finished reading this book.

On the contrary, all other books from Amazon that I bought, I finished them all, mostly because I chose the subject Iike, and stuck to the very end.

No disrespect to the writer, who also loved her.  Janet Tien",1400716800,,418,4.434210526315789
8512409,5,B0078V62I8,"A mainly-silent film, some in German . . . no English subtitles.  But that doesn't matter.  The world's most beautiful woman in her most beautiful condition.  This one will only appeal to film purists, but it will appeal greatly.",1381363200,,229,4.82051282051282
8512410,5,B0078V62I8,"The plot is developed through the writing and the acting and there's never much doubt as to what's going on in the movie, even though there's not much dialogue and it's not in English anyway.  The movie's probably best known, if it's known at all, for being the first film starring Hedy Lamarr, 15 years old at the time. The sound is rather scratchy but not so much so as to be distracting.  It has an old-fashioned look to it, as well it should, being made in the early 1930's.in Czechoslovakia.  There's nothing old-fashioned about the themes of love, betrayal, and despair, developed better in this movie that in any other made in the last fifty years.",1377388800,2,655,4.581196581196581
8512411,3,B0078V62I8,"First, let me say that the DVD itself was fine, played well, didn't seem to have any scene skips, etc. So the lower rating is just that the movie wasn't my cup of tea. Very long, drawn out scenes, shallow plot, & pointless scenes. Hedy Lamarr is stunningly beautiful, making the movie tolerable.",1375142400,,295,4.584905660377358
8512412,4,B0078V62I8,"For the little talking there is in this film, it's all in German.  At first I found it disappointing, but then by the end of the movie I was hooked.  It's a movie that you think about later after it's over.  Just the way it was filmed, the photography, the simplicity of it all made you get the message they were trying to get across (and with no understanding of the language).  It's very rare that I watch a movie and think about how the director made the movie special, but he certainly did with this one.  Being a woman, i personally found this to be a great love story.",1374883200,2,574,4.181818181818182
8512413,5,B0078V62I8,"This is a true classic. Eighty years ago Hey Lamarr created an image that can only be copied, and not surpassed. The black and
white format only adds to the eroticism.",1362700800,8,167,4.419354838709677
8512414,4,B0078V62I8,"Unless you want a version with prettier cover art (and up to six minutes of missing footage) this no frills DVD is the one to buy!  The film stock condition is beat-up in places, but it's watchable overall.

You already know what the movie's about, so I'm sure you're looking for an uncensored version...like this one!",1362614400,13,318,4.660714285714286
