5734956,5,B00CQAUNWW,"Bill Bixby shows he is a great actor in this legendary science-fiction classic about a scientist's transformation into the Incredible Hulk.  While I have never been a big fan of the Hulk while reading Marvel Comics, this series is superb.",1379030400,3,238,4.95
5734957,5,B00CQAUNWW,Just as i remembered it as a kid even though it seem a little cheezey with the limited special effects it is still a great series,1379030400,,129,4.0
5734958,5,B00CQAUNWW,"This is one of the best TV shows from the past! I have the Box Set! This TV show was when TV was worth watching.
And the story was good. The Acting right on it. The actors could act. And it would keep you going for a good 50-55 mins.
This show can put 90% of the trash on TV today to shame.
If you have not got the Hunk. Get it! Well worth the money!",1376438400,3,350,3.6184210526315788
5734959,4,B00CQAUNWW,"I rate this product highly. Universal is the company notorious for not remastering or adding extras. Especially when many of the actors are still alive or were around the time they released many of these DVD box sets. That is my only complaint about the product. However, releasing the complete series is great. I also give them many points for the lenticular covers, or 3-d covers. I had that exact same idea for the box covers, and to my amazement, they actually did it! I never wrote to them, just thought of it. THe series itself is under-rated, with stars from other shows, musicians like rick springfield, a few strange moments, and special episodes. ""King of the Beach"". Also, this was one of those series like Kojak, Columbo, and Murder She Wrote, that never really went away. From time to time there would be a new episode years after the series was over. Although not the product, I really am disappointed they never made a good last ending episode. Around 2006 or so, Lou was still so buff he could have played the HULK again and shocked the hell out of people coming back after so long, and I believe Jack Colvin was still alive to chase him one last time. That would have been awesome and a fitting ending for the series. Even now, after so many years, they could do CGI, animation, and special effects easily to make a good finale. Even at an advanced age, Lou is still way bigger than Arnold, and could play the role to some extent I think. I mention this to you HULK fans out there, so you might write to Universal and get something going. Like mainly a kickstarter, and secondarily a petition.

This set is a must for Hulk fans! The TV movies after the show was canceled are not as good, and they have corny marvel characters interacting with ""the creature"", but if you're a fan you have to get them as well. Lou, if you're reading this, I want to see you on the big screen again!!",1376352000,4,1898,4.43839541547278
5734960,5,B00CQAUNWW,"I own the whole series, both per season, and the unopened box set. It was money well spent. I grew up with the series and never get tired of watching it. The bonus material alone is great too watch. The only thing that is notably absent are interviews with the surviving cast members. Bixby passed away in the early 90s. But I think Jack Colvin was still around when the series was first released on dvd. And it was Ferrigno's first role, maybe he could of done an audio commentary with Kenneth Johnson on the original pilot, Promethious, and his first speaking role on King of the Beach. Maybe on blu-ray, someday. Lol",1376265600,8,619,4.486725663716814
5734961,5,B00CQAUNWW,"I own the complete series of The Incredible Hulk.

Let me tell you, it is the greatest piece of television series that I've seen! Every episode is seen in its entirety. The videos are in great shape!

The producer, Ken Johnson is brilliant. He put together a wonderful series that will last lifetimes! Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno, and the many many guest stars on the shows make it a wonderful series to watch!

I watched each and every episode and even had conferences with Kenny!!
The Bonus Material on the dvds are simply beautiful!

This is a treasure that anyone would love to own-especially ME !!!
