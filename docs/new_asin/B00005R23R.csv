1653875,4,B00005R23R,"Maybe it's just my poor timing, but I find these episodes to be ones that haven't often turned up on Scifi.  They're both excellent. Without spoilers, the first one begins with the crew hilariously munching out and trashing each other while occasionally throwing food, interrupted by Moya splitting into dimensions.  The dimensional shifts are handled differently than usual, which is quite interesting.  In A Bug's Life, Crichton masquerades as a Peacekeeper captain in order to deal with a peacekeeper crew landing on Moya, but much else goes on, with Erin particularly good in this episode believably attracted to someone other than John.  The ""extra"" focuses on Lani Tupu.  It is terrible, like all the extras on the Farscape dvd's, but is redeemed by his talking of how he voices Pilot!",1030492800,4,791,5.053846153846154
1653876,4,B00005R23R,"Science fiction tv series often find it difficult to maintain a high level of quality in their first year, and while FARSCAPE has had some inconsistency in this regard, the ninth DVD of the first season of the series brings us two of the best episodes in the first season to this date.
The first episode on the DVD, ""Through the Looking Glass,"" offers the vision of a Moya split into four different realities through the act of the Leviathan's attempting to Starburst without enough energy to make the trip successfully.  Each of the realities has variances from the norm that make the situation more difficult.  Crichton manages to find gateways or doorways between the realities, and attempts to bring the four Moyas back together again.  But there is another force at work here, a force that is ripping gouges in the realities of the various Moyas, and perhaps this is the biggest threat of all...or not.  This episode brings together some of the best characterisation and acting in the series so far, presenting as it does two marvellous ""dinner on Moya"" scenes - one at the beginning, one at the end - that truly frame the differences in the crew at the two different points of the story.  It is an episode where Chiana truly begins to fit in on Moya (in her own way, of course), and where we get to see a different side of Rygel and the others as well.
The second episode is ""A Bug's Life,"" the first season episode that leads into the story arc that wraps up the season which will change the lives of the characters forever.  When Larraq and his fellow PK Commandos commandeer Moya to transport a single crate to the Peacekeeper Gammak base in the Uncharted Territories, Crichton and Aeryn masquerade as PKs, while D'Argo, Zhaan, and Rygel pretend to be prisoners once more.  But when Rygel and Chiana's curiosity get the better of them and they open the crate, they release a virus on board that threatens the entire crew...and may cost one of Moya's crew's life.  This episode is a marvellous morality play that deals with the issues of trust, and has a wonderfully paranoid feeling to it.  Heck, ""evil Crichton"" is worth seeing this one for!
Both episodes have some extended footage here that adds to the stories in general, and ""A Bug's Life"" is notable in this regard, featuring a good scene between Aeryn and Larraq that explains much of the personality of our favourite female PK.  Thh additional footage in ""Through the Looking Glass"" is also worth the effort of seeing, and provides a bit of insight into the major characters, but doesn't really enhance what we've seen to this point.  What would have made this DVD really exceptional would have been a commentary version of each of these episodes, since both are psychological works that really would have been enhanced by such material.  There is a nice Profile on Lani Tupu's work here, although there was less time than I would have liked to see devoted to Pilot in this, but such is life and all.
With two of the best episodes of the first season on it, this ninth FARSCAPE DVD is a good buy as each of these episodes is worth viewing more than once.  A few more extras on the DVD wouldn't have hurt it, but I think that this DVD is still worth the price.",1016582400,5,3226,4.579861111111111
1653877,5,B00005R23R,"Farscape is a rarity in the Sci-Fi genre.  It not only blends a rich tapestry of other worldly creatures and civilizations, but it also manages to tie the themes of this magnificent universe to our own existence here on the (relatively) ""backwards"" earth.  Henson's creature shop works marvels with the aliens and cities and jungles of various worlds.  Also because it shoots in Australia, the supporting cast and one shot charactors have great accents that add a rich feel to the dialouge.  Truely a great Sci-Fi show.",1007164800,3,519,4.931034482758621

1653899,5,B00005R23R,"It is my belief that one of the largest blunders from the Sci-Fi channel was to cancel Farscape.  I thought it was an excellent series.  Although many people were turned off by the modest use of muppets for some of the aliens, it was my opinion that allowed for a wide array of alien life.

Season 3 is a tough season to start with.  I would highly suggest starting from Season 1 to get familiar with the characters, but by the time this series hits season 3, this train will be moving!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape-Season-1-Collection-1-Starburst-Edition/dp/B0002S65LI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape - Season 1, Collection 1 (Starburst Edition)</a>

1653900,5,B00005R23R,Farscape is tied with Red Dwarf and the Stargates as one of my favorite shows of all time. I love the starburst editions for their price and the considerably smaller shelf space compared to the previous release of Farscape on DVD. My one complaint is the cases are crap. Most of the cases for the starburst collection have 1-3 disc hubs broken. I forget where but I eventually found the case manufacturer and was able to order repacements. The replacements were the exact size but the disc hubs had been greatly improved.,1178496000,,521,4.673913043478261
1653901,4,B00005R23R,"I started watching Farscape in Season 3. I watched all episodes and reruns I could get my hands on. I think they were INSANE to drop it from television.

I eventually bought the entire collection at once.

The only reason I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars, is because of the quality of the DVD. The inner clips of the box break very easily. The DVD always defaults back to subtitles between episodes, which is really annoying.

Even with the problems of the DVD, I love this set.",1175472000,,476,4.266666666666667
1653902,5,B00005R23R,"Farscape is a unique and highly entertaining show. The drama in Season 3, Collection 3 is at its most intense and hard to beat. A must have for fans of the show.",1170720000,,161,4.0625
1653903,5,B00005R23R,"This show was one of the best science fiction shows around. Third season was even better than the first two.

Wish it was never cancelled.",1168214400,2,138,4.52
1653904,5,B00005R23R,"Finally, I can give this series 5 stars. As with many other people, the first 6 collections were very problematic, freezing, skipping, popping or just flat out not playing. While some die hard fans mark my reviews unhelpful as I report the disc quality and not the quality of the show! (I figure you know what you are buying! and would better like to know the quality of what you are getting.) The series is a solid 5 in my book, and has always been so, but not the first 6 collections due to the double sided, dual layer format that caused so many to be returned, as with other folks here I too had to return 4 of the 6 before I was able to get a collection that would play properly. WITH THIS COLLECTION ... ADV finally saw the light! They released the collection on single sided disc, and while I'm not happy with ADV as I asked if there was a problem with them long, long ago and they just acted as if it was the first time they heard anything. I had to contact them as I was having trouble getting a RMA AGIAN for a bad disc, by correcting the release and putting them on 4 disc instead of 2 they have all but admitted there was in fact a PROBLEM! Even though they would not admit it months ago. I even have an email from them stating there was no plan to release them on 4 disc! I guess they got as tired of complaints as buys got of returning them. The single sided collection is far better than the prior as you would think in quality, no skipping, no popping, no freezing, nothing but good solid Farscape fun and entertainment, without having to try and skip over bad spots or fiddle with to get it to play.

We can only hope that ADV will offer a trade in offer on those releases already out to upgrade to the problem free collection. Sure it will cost them money, but it cost those of us with bad disc time and money to find one(s) that worked. (A 80 mile roundtrip drive for me in rural Kentucky) The very least they could do is to offer a replacement collection at cost for the first 6 collections. As of this writing I do not know if they plan to release the first 6 collections (2 seasons) on single sided disc or not, however a wise company would. My guess is you will find a lot of 2 disc collections on eBay if they do. Again a great series finally on enough disc to justify buying it. Plenty of extras over the boxset releases, albeit again many are repeated from disc to disc and collection to collection, overall good video and audio quality for hours of viewing. Well worth adding to your collection for those Farscape fans, just hope the first 6 releases are corrected and re-issued.",1158192000,7,2606,4.222444889779559
1653905,5,B00005R23R,"Warning:  Spoilers

Actually, the spoiler alert was fairly needless since the official editorial review provides some pretty major spoilers without a warning.  But I believe in following protocol.

For me, this set is where all the great things that happened in the first three seasons of FARSCAPE paid off.  I know of no more poignant, painful, and heartbreaking episodes in all of TV history.  The closest I can come is perhaps the great final episode of Season Two of BUFFY where Buffy is forced to kill Angel after he regains his soul.  In the 3.1 set we saw John Crichton cloned into a copy so perfect that not even the most stringent testing will reveal who is the original.  The 3.2 set collecting the central set up episodes saw the consummation of the love between one of the two Johns and Aeryn and then the death of that John.  Meanwhile, the other John has been anxiously awaiting the return of Aeryn.  This final set deals with Aeryn's struggle to overcome her grief over the death of the one John and her hesitation to become involved with the other, for a host of powerful reasons.  One sympathizes with both John and Aeryn, John because she really has fallen in love with him and expressed her love for him, but with a different copy of himself.  Aeryn, on the other hand, has to contend with a situation that no other lover in history has had to contend, the simultaneous death and survivor of the man she loves.

In the final episodes of the 3.2 set, John was able to unlock the wormhole technology hidden in his head and is able via videotape to communicate to the other John the importance of this fact.  The final episodes of the season deal with John's realization that he has to take the offensive to Scorpius.  These are some great episodes filled with wonderful details.  The scenes in which Aeryn has to struggle with her return to a Peacekeeper base are affecting, as is Crais's return.  One of the great visual images in a very visual series occurs when Scorpius, his world in ruin, slowly descends a staircase as he contemplates the enormity of the devastation that John and his friends have wrought.

But in the long saga of the love between John and Aeryn, few are as moving as the final episode.  For several episodes they have not had to deal with their situation or confront what had happened with the other John.  Now, however, all changes.  In perhaps their greatest scene together, John does his best to persuade Aeryn to not give up on their love, while she remains determined to leave.  Finally, they agree to flip a coin, and though at the moment it appears that she won, as she puts it in Season Four, they both lost.  An Old Woman who has mysteriously appeared on Moya (she returns as a regular in Season Four and gains a name) and who possesses remarkable medicinal powers informs that Aeryn is pregnant.  In another of the great images that FARSCAPE seemed to create so effortlessly we see John in his space module outside Moya staring determinedly straight ahead, Aeryn in her prowler to John's left gazing at him, trying to get him to acknowledge her before she leaves.  We don't see her leave as much as just fade out of focus.  And thus ends one of the great romantic arcs in the history of television.

This bears repeating.  Forget that this is Sci-fi rather than drama or comedy or whatever.  I honestly believe the romantic tensions between John and Aeryn in Season Three represents the most outstanding romantic arc in the history of television.  Television is littered with dozens of great romantic couples, and even when they don't end up with each other at the end of a series, there is a sense that they were meant for each other.  Most of these romances proceed in ways that seem obvious as they are happening.  We might be surprised, but rather are we stunned.  There is almost nothing that happens between John and Aeryn that happens by any book that has ever been written in the history of the medium.  Their romance simply has no other parallels, no analogs.  Even now, after having watched these episodes several times, I remain in awe of how brilliantly conceived this season was.  Season Four would also be a great season on more than one level, but neither as a whole nor as a romance could it match Season Three.

I have told numerous friends that they need to watch FARSCAPE for two reasons:  first, it is just a great series as a whole, but second, they need to watch it if for no other reason than to get to Season Three.  I honestly believe that this is the single finest season of any Sci-fi series ever made, and it all comes to fruition in the marvelous episodes in this particular set.",1140652800,29,4660,4.555288461538462
1653906,4,B00005R23R,"In ""Through the Looking Glass,"" the pregnant Moya attempts to starburst prematurely, thereby lodging herself in the interdimensional space that is crossed instantaneously during a normal passage.  Crichton (Ben Browder) must coordinate efforts in four distinctive and coexisting environments in order to save the day.  A substandard episode.

""A Bug's Life"" has a cliche premise (who is harboring the body-snatching alien invader?), but redeems itself with exceptional plotting and direction.  This episode generates more tension than one would expect from series television.",1128124800,,575,5.975609756097561
1653907,5,B00005R23R,"Both episodes are superior pieces of work from the first season of Farscape.
""Through the Looking Glass"" is a supurb stand-alone episode that is, IMHO, the best introduction to those new to the Farscape universe.  All of Moya's crew gets to shine is this interesting set-piece when Moya gets stuck in starburst and is split into four separate environments representing normal, light, sound, & giddyness (I guess).  Note how the show begins and ends with the crew eating together and just how different the mood is between both scenes.  Also note Chiana's rather cat-like growl at John in the ""happy"" section.
""A Bug's Life"" in notable for being the first in the five-episode run that ended the first season. It's best viewed with the rest of the episodes so you can fully enjoy the storyline.
A hearty recommendation and bon appetite!",1087430400,,834,4.900709219858156

7951942,4,B00005R23R,"The history of the three seasons, all the character development, and plots comes all together in one big explosive climax in the last few episodes.  Crichton goes for an end-game - he wants Scorpius off his back.  Can he trust Crais to help him when he can't even trust some members of his own crew?  I liked the development of the characters in the final moments and also did enjoy seeing life on a Command Carrier.  We do get a lot of insight into the characters while expanding the universe of Farscape.

Jim Henson produced the series and his hand was very evident by the character of Domina Ridgel who looked like an overgrown snail who was a de-throned ruler of billions of his kind.  True to form he was ruthless and a thief but still had a few good traits on occasion.  It was that rare SCI-FI show that didn't loose itself in special effects.  Instead it had great acting and stories.  Watch one or two shows and you cared about John, Aeryn and the others.  I found buying the Starburst set cheaper than the boxed set.

7951944,5,B00005R23R,"I thought this show portrayed one of the most realistic views of a universe far from our own, and how a guy surprisedly stranded there would behave.  This is not the utopia of Star Trek, where we humans are always good and everyone else ends up being so impressed by us in the end.  These creatures have seen lots of different sentient beings, and we are just one of them.  In fact, we are evolutionarily far behind most of them, and the human is at best tolerated, and at worst, teased for his cluelessness.  The only reason anyone chases him is because a more advanced being put knowledge in his head that has worth, and he accidentally killed the brother of an important official.  Our space hubris was put aside in this show, making it so much more touching and amusing.  I had no problem playing any of the discs.",1216166400,,818,4.42
