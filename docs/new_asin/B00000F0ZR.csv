7906205,5,B00000F0ZR,"Touching Heaven, Changing Earth, although one of their older videos, is awesome and inspiring.  If you haven't seen any of the Hillsong videos, or heard their CD's, you must.  Having just returned from Sydney and their  Hillsong 2000 conference, I can't recommend their products highly enough.  God is truly using this church to affect the church worldwide.  You must  see their subsequent videos as well; By Your Side, and the most current  (not out in the states until fall '2000) For This Cause.  Blessings on all  of You.",964742400,3,525,4.875
7906206,5,B00000F0ZR,"Honestly -- Hills Christian Life Centre, the church the Hillsongs ministry belongs to, is seriously blessed.  This video is AWESOME (as are the videos Shout to the Lord 2000, All Things Are Possible and By Your Side).  You  just HAVE to see and EXPERIENCE this!... their ministry is incrediably  annointed, the lyrics absolutely biblical, the music of the highest quality  and beauty.  I just love Darlene Zschech so much in the Lord because as  worship pastor she has assembled a great group of godly musicians and  singers which God can really use to bless the whole world.  May they all  stay humble, sincere and eager like they are now!",960595200,5,640,4.7889908256880735
7906207,5,B00000F0ZR,"the best praise video, bar none, ever produced. every song is wonderful and you can feel the presence of god in your home. crank up your speakers and it is impossible to sit still and just watch. you do not want to pass  this video up.",957052800,2,235,4.108695652173913
7906208,5,B00000F0ZR,"If you are involved in praise and worship ministry it will be tough for you to shut off the VCR once you start playing this video.  Hillsongs brings you into a new dynamic atmosphere to let everything go and just  worship God!  I have watched it at least 5 times now since I got it about a  month and a half ago, and I never get tired of watching it!  I also observe  that once the worship leaders put everything aside and worship freely, the  congregation will follow.  Just something worship ministries should keep in  mind.  Anyways, I know you will be blessed by it!",938390400,5,570,4.3428571428571425
7906209,5,B00000F0ZR,"It's all about ""touching heaven"" and this video brings you to your knees.  The energy and the sincerity of heart, of the singers, is evidence in their worship to God. The Holy Spirt was profoundly present and  the Shakana Glory fills your house when you play this video.  I saw it at a  friends and I plan to purchase the video in a few days.  I have had the  cassette for quite a while and when I saw the video and listened to the  cassette I could see the worship leaders and put voices to faces.  I also  enjoy ""All things are possible"".  My prayers are with this  ministry and all the freedom and energy they present in their worship to  God.  Thanks for sharing the gifts and talents that God has placed inside  of each and everyone.",935625600,3,738,4.253623188405797
7906210,5,B00000F0ZR,"This video is anointed!  From the first song to the incredible ending, this video is yet another example of God's anointing on Hillsong Australia. All of your favorite singers and musicians are featured. You don't want to  miss this one!",915062400,,237,4.9
7906211,5,B00000F0ZR,"Touching Heaven, Changing Earth is not the typical worship  video that is simply 'listened' to.  It has an interactive 'drawing' quality that commands your full attention and participation.  This video touches the  heart.  The music itself springs  from hearts that have experienced their  own lyrics.  It is not merely a manufactured video. It is, indeed, a 'live'  video!",914198400,,373,5.293103448275862
