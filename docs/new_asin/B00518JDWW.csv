4519629,5,B00518JDWW,"Why didn't this film do better at the box office?  Was it the marketing or, was it was just too cerebral for most of the movie going public.  Perhaps the trailer gave the impression of unremitting and unrewarded suffering.  In the last case, be assured that there is true and well deserved redemption that comes with a twist at the end.  Whatever the problem was, the fault was not the film.  But, it prevented this movie from drawing an audience in numbers it should have.  And that is a shame.  Its failure at the box office will further dampen the spirits and limit the opportunities of truly original film makers.  Don't let this happen.  Buy this movie and reward intelligent, creative and thought provoking films that will provide a welcome relief to the normal mindless Hollywood fare.",1318032000,110,792,4.7226277372262775

Premise:  After a young woman, Rhoda, drives drunk, killing a wife and her son, leaving the husband a widower, she tries to find worthwhile motivations and actions thereafter.  A second Earth has entered Earth's orbit, an Earth where an identical version of Rhoda (and everyone else) may have made similar or dissimilar actions starting on the evening before her fateful decision to drive drunk.  Rhoda is given the rare opportunity to fly in a spaceship to the other Earth and see if she can live in a world where she did not make her fatal mistake.  Rhoda is also given the option to stay on her original Earth and try to make amends with the widower she harmed.

Review:  Not since 2004's ""Primer"" have I been so impressed with a group of new writers and filmmakers putting together such a thought-provoking and well-made film.

The script is tight, linear, and clear, never needing to rely on flashbacks or long parallel-universe explanations and exceptions (as is so often the case in sci-fi stories).  The cinematography is great.  The storyboarding is solid.  The use of the ever-enlarging Earth in the day and night sky is a beautiful and effective visual device.  Not since the two Suns of Tatooine have I been so impressed with an environmental backdrop.

The sound design for the film is fully integrated with the screenplay progressions.  The writers and director fully intended viewers to be using more than simply their visual senses.  The narrative about the Russian cosmonaut's sound dilemma is poetic and consistent with the film's questions and themes.

The film editing is concise.  The camera work is never distracting, it never took me out of the story flow or broke the pleasant illusory suspension of disbelief (other critics complained about the frequent use of handheld shots).  The costume design is fitting.  The set design is consistent with the tones of the film.  I noticed the monochromatic color post-editing in several scenes, but if you're not a film buff, then you probably won't be distracted by it.  The monochromatic color filtering is consistent with the scenes' emotional intents.

Performances:  The acting is solidly anchored in Brit Marling and William Mapother's performances.  This is a close-quartered and intimate film that capably takes on universal questions.

What from outside the film helps someone understand the film?  The lead actress co-wrote the screenplay.  So, watching the performance with that knowledge is kind of like watching a singer-songwriter perform one of their own songs.

Surprisingly poor about the film:  Nothing.

SPOILERS AHEAD:

Some of the morals and themes of the story:  Sometimes your most worthwhile competition will be yourself.  The film asks the question:  If you caught up with your identical self 5 years from now, and if you had to ethically compete with you, would you be embarrassed by the quality of your decisions and actions?

The film's ending most likely implies that Rhoda on Earth 2 killed John's family on Earth 2.  Rhoda on Earth 2 also probably won the essay contest.  But Rhoda on Earth 2 maybe didn't make the same decision to offer John the opportunity to reunite with his family.  Alternatively, John on Earth 2 may have declined to accept the ticket offered to him, so the other Rhoda on Earth 2 could have a chance to start anew in a world without her actions' horrific consequences.

One of beautiful tragedies of the ending is John travels to live with the other John.  John, arriving at Earth 2, likely realizes his wife and son are also dead there, and he left a woman, Rhoda, who truly cared for him and gave him the most valuable thing she had: a chance at a different and better life.  John travels to discover his ""new Earth,"" his new start, has no version of Rhoda in it.

I found the ending uplifting as I implied that Rhoda on Earth 1, the Rhoda we followed throughout the film, likely made a final decision (choosing to offer the valuable ticket to John) she was happy with, arguably a better decision than the decision made by Rhoda from Earth 2.

A concept that can be implied from the ending is:  Sometimes it may be better to stick around, trying to make the best of the poor circumstances that remain rather than to leave with the primary intent of trying to escape your past.

Is there a timeless question?:  What if you are a uniquely beautiful person with unique opportunities to improve your life and the life of the few people around you?  If you are such a person, and if you've made horrific mistakes in your past that you can never undo, then is there still honor in doing the best you can with what you have left?  What if your most worthwhile competition is not other people, but instead is you?  Can you compete with the quality of actions an alternative version of you might do?  Can anyone more capably compete against you?

What I learned:  I get so frustrated watching TV and Movies these days, feeling so often that I've been there and already knew that.  This film knocked me back and slapped me upside the head.  It gave me inspiring concepts and motivation.  For bright people, it's often hard to find engaging and quality companions and contemporaries.  This film dared me to compete against any lazier version of me.

There is so much more to learn from this film than I've discussed herein.  And I look forward to hearing others' perceptions and assumptions about this film.  This film, like many great stories and mysteries, doesn't answer all the questions.  Instead, it poses worthwhile questions.

Something worth knowing about the movie you may not already know:  It was made for less than $200,000.

In reading other reviews, I thought the criticism too often criticized the film for not being a film or story this film did not intend to be.  And that's often invalid criticism.  Some reviewers didn't like that the film lacked an ending with clear and narrow definition.  They didn't want the film to be like life, with loose ends and indefiniteness still ahead.

Responding to Roger Ebert's review: Ebert gave this little film an impressive 3.5 out of 4 stars.  I agree with most of Ebert's comments, however, I don't think this film is ""less profound . . . than Tarkovsky's ""Solaris,' another film about a sort of parallel Earth.""  I love Tarkovsky's ""Solaris.""  I even love Soderbergh's and Clooney's ""Solaris.""  But ""Another Earth"" is not a closely comparative plot arc.  Nevertheless, ""Another Earth"" is equally profound and moving, using more subtle methods.  Watching ""Another Earth"" may require from a viewer more connecting of the dots and imagination, but that doesn't make it less profound.",1315353600,37,6691,4.8514588859416445
4519631,5,B00518JDWW,"""Another Earth"" is one of those refreshing films that I can say, in a positive tone, is unlike anything I've ever seen before.  What if there was another earth just like ours out there?  What if there was another you who made better choices?  The film deals with grief, regret, sadness, and redemption creatively.  Every time I began to roll my eyes at a plot development, a scene would come that would satisfy my skepticism.  And the ending blew me away.  While it may technically be sci-fi, it's the dramatic strength that carries the film.  It's like what ""Million Dollar Baby"" was to boxing.  Now this movie won't be for everyone, but I absolutely loved it, and you should really give it a try.",1314662400,22,698,4.57258064516129
4519632,5,B00518JDWW,"No plot spoilers!

Contrary to what you might have read here and elsewhere, 'Another Earth' is definitely a science fiction tale.  Unfortunately, many people believe if there aren't space monsters or robots, it's not a science fiction piece.  A work, such as this one, can be more focused on human nature and the reaction to different 'science fiction' happenstances than to the special effects themselves.

'Another Earth' is a beautiful exploration of ruined lives, and the thought that maybe things done can be undone.  In that way, there are some elements of fantasy involved.  Here, the strange appearance of another Earth gives a scientific plausibility to the fantasy.

Brit Marling is luminous as Rhoda Williams, who yearns for second chances.  William Mapother plays John Burroughs, who is the object of Rhoda's dream of putting things right, though she goes about it in a terribly precarious manner.

A note on the production values.  It definitely has an 'indie' look.  The film was shot on film instead of video, which is a good choice to give a rich, warm look.  But there are a lot of hand-held shots which were disconcerting.  And the rapid zooms really gave the film a more of an amateurish look, in my opinion.  And there are several instances of poor focus that the camera operator rapidly tries to find the correct focus.  That detracts from the look of the film.

The appearance of Earth II is not impossible, if one subscribes to the parallel universe thinking, or the multiple world idea.  Think of a Earth of a parallel universe that shows up suddenly, as the membranes they dwell on come closer and closer together.  Research string theory and judge for yourself.

Strongly recommended.  Intelligent science fiction films are a rarity; this joins the short list of such films.",1314576000,2,1800,4.916943521594685
4519633,5,B00518JDWW,"A young woman driving intoxicated slams into another car, killing two people. Upon her release from prison, she meets the husband and father of those she killed. This coincides with the appearance of a planet identical to ours in the universe. This is a pretty deep film, despite its low budget and unknown cast. Will the woman tell the man that she killed his family? Is she going to travel to earth 2? The film's unlikely storyline is overshadowed by its powerful narrative, that of a woman seeking forgiveness from someone she has hurt and wanting to know if she has another self in the same predicament. This one is a real gem.",1313280000,2,631,4.592920353982301
4519634,4,B00518JDWW,"I think just about everyone looks up at the sky every so often and wonders what else is out there. Outer space is filled with so many unexplored territories that logically speaking there has to be intelligent life out there somewhere. Otherwise it'd just be a waste of space. Undiscovered planets and unimaginable life forms are only the half of it. What if there's another planet somewhere in the cosmos similar to earth? Raising the stakes a bit, what if you and everyone you knew was also on that planet in addition to earth like an alternate universe that was right within our grasps? That is essentially what makes Another Earth so interesting.

Earth 2; that's what the planet is being called that is right within our atmosphere. They're saying another you is on that planet that may have made all the decisions you wish you had or married the person you always wish you did. Sometimes the concept of a film is really powerful. It's so powerful and so intriguing that it kind of backs itself into a corner since there's really no way the film will ever be able to follow through with a product that's quite as good as its concept. Another Earth is kind of like that. The film does its best to intertwine the stories of Earth 2 and the blossoming relationship between Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling) and John Burroughs (William Mapother) and it all comes together in a really satisfying way. But you're also left wondering what the planet would be like if we actually got to take the trip there in the film. Is animal life the same? Do they have similar technology? Are famous monuments altered at all? The questions are endless and while its best to leave these questions open ended, part of you is left wondering if some of these questions could've been answered with a larger budget.

The soundtrack was nearly as brilliant as the concept of the film. It's a rather brilliant mix of classical and electronic music with more of an emphasis falling on the classical part since John Burroughs is a composer. Classical scores always seem to bring out the best in films and the few electronic tracks threw in a little bit of unpredictability that also strangely fit the tone and atmosphere of the film.

The biggest weakness Another Earth has is its camera work. It feels downright amateurish at times. Things seem to smooth out a bit in the second half, but objects and people on screen start off being blurry or out of focus right from the start. So while there were a few interesting perspectives thrown in, it didn't really make up for the camera being out of position at times and wondering if the awkward camera work was intentional at others.

Another Earth latches onto your interest right out of the gate with a rather high impact introduction and keeps that engrossing factor alive throughout its duration. The bonding that takes place between Rhoda and John takes the front seat while the hype around Earth 2 is kind of the side seat driver; you're always hearing about it but it never really becomes a factor until the conclusion. Another Earth also delivers a really satisfying ending. Thinking back on it, there really isn't another way to end a film like this. If it wasn't for the camera work that feels somewhat unprofessional at times, Another Earth would be really fantastic. An absorbing and engaging film with a unique storyline, Another Earth is one of the most thought provoking films of the year.",1313107200,5,3421,4.687188019966722
4519635,4,B00518JDWW,"This movie leaves multiple impressions - the first of which is that the actual situationthe second Earth, lacks utterly in plausibility. So do fairy tales, but I enjoy them anyway.

Another part of the mix comes from the creepier side of stalking, driven by a muddled emotional mix driven by some need so deep within her that Rhoda has no hope of identifying it, and no real urge to. In other words, an emotional mish-mosh that pretty much anyone can recognize, if they've ever looked within themselves at any length.

The visual layer, though, conveys a quite beauty. Rhoda herself could be very beautiful, if she weren't so desperate not to be. The other Earth has an unearthly beauty, one informed by decades of images from space. It also has a presence that keeps intruding quietly, at every turn. I've gotten a similar feeling near Seattle, where Mt. Ranier seems to loom around every corner.

Then, the ending raises more questions than it answers. Years of personal history led up to the period of this movie, and lifetimes continue after this interlude ends - as is true in life, too. ""Another Earth"" defies easy description, but don't most things worth any attention?

4519662,4,B00518JDWW,"In general I am pretty turned off by privileged pretty white girls who affect a persona of twee pseudo-spiritual enlightenment, for obvious reasons. However I really do like Brit Marling's work. On film and in interviews, I always feel like she conveys both honesty and a mature self-awareness that make her a sympathetic character, rather than an obnoxious crystal licker. A large part of this, I think, is a deep sense of vulnerability she exudes in her performances. She always inhabits characters who have a wide breadth of perception for nuance, and whose struggles generally revolve around the ineffability of meaning and truth in a world where people and relationships are far more complex than we are often willing to examine ourselves.

In Another Earth, this dynamic is probably the most deeply examined of any of her works, as the plot revolves almost exclusively between two individuals who are differently scared from a shared trauma. And while the vast majority of the screen time is devoted to the poignant anxiety of unpacking their evolving relationship, the entire story is haunted by questions of agency around our ability to create our own meaning and happiness despite living in a world completely out of our control.

I did like this movie, but I'm only giving it 4/5 because I was rather dissatisfied with the ending. It wasn't a bad ending to be sure, and like all Marling's work, it concludes with a rather abrupt scene that is meant to contextualize the entire film in a way that is purposefully left open to interpretation. My problem is that it was an obvious conceit I saw coming from a mile away. In most of her films, I'm left feeling a bit unsettled and I need some time to quietly meditate afterward to decide how I feel. Unfortunately this time I had already digested this potential outcome over the course of the movie, so by the end it wasn't deeply moving to me, but rather just over. So despite being a good movie, I do feel this is the weakest of Marling's career.",1490140800,,2003,4.752873563218391

4519680,5,B00518JDWW,"I watched ""The OA"" on Netflix and Brit Marling fascinated me. Her IMDB profile said she went into writing so she could write her own parts. What a smart womanand it worked. After watching ""The OA"" I wanted to watch ""Another Earth"" to see what Marling had done previously. ""Another Earth"" is a touching story billed as sci-fi, but the real enjoyment of it is in the superb writing and acting. The movie is done in a ""visionary"" (as in Visionary Fiction Alliance) flavor, just as was ""The OA."" Nice!

It's not a hard sci-fi story. The sci-fi component is really secondary to the lead character's psychological, moral and romantics challenges; and, how she works them out. For me, though, the sci-fi aspect gave the entire movie a surreal feeling. Brilliantly done!",1482969600,,762,4.7727272727272725

Especially clean and clear of their own lens. This film speaks directly to our inherent synchronicity - with each other, our soul, the Earth, the Universe. It takes an ordinary darkness and expands it into the fractal of spirit that all darkness is born of... Light. Not redemption. Conscious awareness struggled for and found. Where an ex-con, a drunken naivety, a ""girl just like any other girl"" lives her path with intense moment-to-moment angst-soul turned open like an orange peel turned inside out where the flavor and nourishment hides... in realizing thru not knowing but enquiring and expressing her truth, her, and, ultimately, all our connectedness. Mirroring and the breaking and mending of the Hoop of the World - as we have and can she finds who she is is far more than what she's done. Healing our unconscious, repressed psyche by digging in and seeking... how 'out there' can be 'in here' thru love and forgiveness via apology and intensive inward looking courage, this matrix of insights applies nicely to our world in America today, just one day after now of a kind of 'new earth' - after the election of the 45th US president. Clean our lens, love and forgiveness. Intense introspection, and clean the walls and floors and ceilings of our (Washington D.C.) house. And with courage to go alone into the unknown, find real actualization of our soul, even when trying to perhaps escape it.

4519748,4,B00518JDWW,"I borrowed this BluRay movie from our county library, because the premise intrigued me. (I can remember a dream from my childhood when I saw and somehow traveled to the duplicate Earth that was exactly opposite our Earth on the other side of the sun, so I had a personal desire to see how they handled it differently than this sound-asleep dream.)

This is a disquieting movie that is primarily about the difficult relationship between a young woman (21 years old) and a somewhat older man. It is a movie about the desire to apologize for past mistakes, the need to forgive yourself, and the need to bring everything to a closure, no matter how much it might change your life to do so.

Rhoda, when she was still under age, while drunk, caused an accident that kills a man's wife and son (and their unborn daughter). Can you imagine what his life must be like, living in their home alone, not being able to let go of the memories or the anger against the teenager who killed his family? Instead of going to college to study cosmology, she spends that time in a youth facility, all of which we have to imagine.

John and Rhoda eventually come to truly enjoy each other's company, but things change once he realizes who she truly is. We know that, years before, he tried to track her down in his anger for what she did to his family, but he never was able to get that information as her exact identity was sealed due to her age at the time of the crime.

As I said, this is a profound and deep film. There is another Earth that is only discovered after the beginning scene of the movie, and that alternate Earth shows us, in my opinion, John's and Rhoda's desires to go back and change the past, or at least understand how things might have been different had she not made her terrible mistake.

Unfortunately, in my opinion, the movie ends without showing us how things were actually different on the other planet. We do see Rhoda meet Rhoda, but the movie ends without any dialogue between them. Did John's family survive on Earth 2? I'll have to use my imagination to answer that question, and your answer may be different than mine.

This is a weird movie. I cut it down to four stars because I hate the abrupt ending. I also hate not being sure if John ever forgave Rhoda. Would I have been able to do so if I were in his shoes? I hope I would have, but I don't want to find out for sure.

If you enjoy having your thoughts provoked *, definitely get this movie. (* thought provoking)

4519759,5,B00518JDWW,"Those expecting a more typical science-fiction story will be disappointed by this heartfelt portrait of choices, despair & possible redemption ... but they'll be missing a superb film. This is one of those rare stories using science-fiction concepts for literary & artistic purposes, rather than just CGI-filled action, with the dual Earth serving as metaphor -- the many roads not taken in a split-second of impulsive decision that changes life irreparably for more than just the individual.

The plot: 17-year old Rhoda is on the fast track to MIT & a brilliant career, when a duplicate Earth appears in the sky. While driving home that night, she glances upward at just the wrong moment & hits another car, killing the wife & child of the driver, who barely survives physically & is clearly dead emotionally, as we see later on. Rhoda serves 4 years as a juvenile, and upon her release, seeks out the most menial work she can find in an effort to punish herself.

And then she realizes that the man whose life she destroyed lives nearby, his musical career shattered along with his heart ...

What follows is painful & strangely heroic, as Rhoda befriends the man without revealing who she is, growing more attached to him & wanting desperately to bring him back to life. At the same time, a billionaire is starting his own private project to reach the other Earth, offering the prize of tickets on his ship to the winners of an essay contest on Why I Want To Go To The Second Earth. Rhoda enters her own essay ...

To say more would be to ruin things. Suffice it to say that the truth must come out eventually, and the characters must come to grips with their crippling shame & loss & guilt ... but can they? And more to the point, can we? Because we've all made those split-second choices that we've regretted for the rest of our lives, and we've all had to live with their consequences.

As I said, if you're hoping for invading aliens, battling starships, robots & rayguns & cosmic explosions -- well, this isn't the place to find them. However, if you're looking for a thoughtful, quietly passionate film about the tragedies & wonders of being human, then you'll find it here -- most highly recommended!",1442620800,3,2211,4.658974358974359

With that essential ""fact"", the story is just about a young woman's one life-changing screw-up and how she and the grief stricken survivor of a tragic family meet and share a relationship. The concept of ""another earth"" is nothing more than a very silly idea upon which the entire story pivots and, in my opinion, fails.

This is another in a new vanguard of sci fi films bravely and creatively attempting to paint a slice of potential reality in an era grappling to come to grips with the meaning of life, and suffering, amidst the new physics of 9 dimensions, 11 dimensions, string theory, parrallel universes, and a holographic, pulsating, living, universe of infinite potentialities and infinite possibilities. Where and how do we fit in?

This film begs the question ...are the answers out THERE? or do we look within ourselves and ask what is conciousness?....and love? and does the power of love supercede the material? Are spirit and matter and conciousness juxtaposed one against the other? Or are they somehow intertwined by love? Are we all ONE, united by love? and is the redemption we seek out among the stars? Or is it within that truly lies the kingdom of heaven?

The narration is inobtrusive yet thought provoking and well paced. The events are simple yet convincing and logical. The actions of heros is very convincing and true, as is the acting. The brilliant play of Brit Marling is so good, it is not noticeable: the character totally takes over the actress and one cannot imagine anything she says or does could be said or done differently. William Mapother play is solid and thorough; both of them slide through the movie almost like a pair of ballet dancers, where the male dancer is that foundation allowing the ballerina to shine.

The director work is exceptional hands down. Brit and Mike really make a good team - maybe more than that. each shot is paced; each action is placed right; each camera motion just adds to the point (oh yeah, the exquisite cinematography present thoughout)

Brit Marling acts with such a natural grace at times I felt uneasy as if I were seeing intimate details of a life that I shouldn't be privvy to. Gems of scenes stay strong in your mind: her re-telling the Russian cosmonaut story. John Burroughs' private performance for Rhoda. Her visiting her co-worker in the hospital.

A quiet, and thought provoking movie, ""Another Earth,"" is a a rare gem of a science fiction movie that uses the genre in a non-intursive way to explore the human condition.
Nelwy graduated from high school, super smart Rhonda is bound for academic gloray at MIT, until she winds up drunk at a party and drives herself home. As she listens to the car radio, the deejay announces that another life bearing planet has been discovered in our Solar System. She looks up at the night sky for the planet since she wants to become an astronaut, and collides with a parked car - killing a woman, her young son, and gravely injuring her husband.
Rhonda does four years for reckless manslaughter - the maximum since she was only 17 years old at the time of the accident.
It turns out that this new world is a duppliate of our own world, that the media has dubbed ""Earth 2.""
Rhonda meanwhiles suffers from deep depression and when released from prison, gets a job as a janitor at a nearby high school.
Determined to make some sort of ammends for the lives she destroyed with her foolishness, Rhonda seeks out the man she injured and discovers that John was once a brilliant compsoer whose life has also taken a downward spiral after she killed his wife and son..
Rhonda goes to his house to apologize, but chickens out, claiming she's a maid with a free trail offer to clean his house.
As Rhonda and John begin a friendship that leaves to the first stirrings of love, Rhonda applies for a chance to travel to Earth 2 on a civilian space shuttle, and wins. She tells John the truth about the night his family was killed, and then....now that would be a major spoiler.
""Another Earth"" is a journey of the soul that examines what happens when we are offered another chance at the life we wanted to live, but lost out on due to our own foolish mistakes.

4519851,2,B00518JDWW,"OK. It's a rather depressing indie movie about an angsty girl on the cusp of becoming an adult who kills most of a family in a drunk driving accident, the inattention triggered by our MacGuffin. She spends the rest of the movie trying to find some form of redemption, tries to kill herself, and a bunch of other stuff, complete with philosophical arguments suitable for high schoolers. She never really seems to find hope, or much else in the way of redeeming qualities that make her interesting as anything but a train wreck.

As an indie movie, for those who like such depressingly pretentious ""artistic"" fare, it's rather well shot and acted.

The movie's biggest crime is that it was severely misrepresented. What it is NOT, is science fiction. No , I don't mean this in the SF snob Star Wars is actually fantasy way.

You don't have to read the next two (in depth) links - I'll summarize -

http://hollowlands.com/2014/07/the-technology-of-magic/
http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6005

In short - the problem with this as SF is NOT that it goes into philosophy, or incorporates a character study, it's that the ""big idea"" or premise is not followed to it's conclusion. It's because the most basic and simple consequences of the setup are completely ignored. The main character may not be an astrophysicist, so beyond a few questions, we don't need to discover ""how"", but the entire impact on her world is that it distracted her on the night of the accident, and she eventually may have a chance to go there. And some pretty background shots. And a few historical and scientific facts and details that are presented are flat out wrong  especially egregious when it's related to her area of expertise.

Cataclysmic world-shattering tidal effects? Economic fallout? Social upheaval? We've got another planet in close proximity and the social and physical upheavals should deeply influence the background if nothing else. I'm not expecting 2013 or Velikovsky here, but there should be a notable impact on how daily life is lived.

Nope  it's all about her. Her guilt. Her absolution. And the cause could have just as easily been a billboard or the moon.

Or they could have made the scope of the macguffin far smaller or more private, like in Donnie Darko, and still been able to ask the same questions....

And if you really want a discussion of philosophy, reality, quantum natures, objectivity vs subjectivity, you may want to read Neal Stephenson's Anathem. But you're not going to get too much angst.",1413763200,11,2499,4.9261904761904765

4519867,4,B00518JDWW,"There have been few films Ive been really excited about. If you read this column at all youll know some
of them--True Grit (2010) or Toy Story 3 (2010) for example. But there is a special place in my column for
those rare finds. I call them The Best Movies You Havent Seen. Some films in this eclectic mix include
Its Kind of a Funny Story (2010), about a boy who checks himself into a psychiatric hospital only to find
hes not that bad off, City Island (2009), about a prison guard lying to his family about his acting
aspirations, and his family lying about everything else; and Me and Orson Wells (2008), about a young
man taken under the wing of the Hollywood underdog/legend. Add another one, namely Another Earth,
to that list.
What is it about these movies that are really exciting? Well, mainly they're made on a lower budget than
most Hollywood films. In fact, most of them aren't really Hollywood but rather the Hollywood studios
independent features armnamely a branch of the big studios that acknowledges (but mainly doesnt
want to pay for the production of) great projects among the not-so-elite filmmakers club.
Have I stalled long enough? Well, theres a reason for my hesitating to tell you much about Another
Earth. Frankly, the plot is so well constructed and executed that to even share the premise might ruin it.
I can tell you that the subplot of the film is cause for what you might read about its being in the science
fiction genrebut don't be tricked by that tag. Yes, there is that subplot of another earth identical to
ours appearing in the sky. Some would argue that you could strip that subplot out and still have a great
story. I disagree. In fact, that small facet of the story--beautifully pictured as another earth that hangs in
the sky like a great, big full moon but with blue--is both integral to the plot but a minor character
simultaneously. Does that make sense? Does it need to? This film was a big winner at Sundance this year
taking two feature film prizes!
The film was co-written and stars Brit Marling, a relatively unknown, completely talented actress/writer.
I had the pleasure of attending a sneak preview in Philadelphia where Ms. Marling was a guest along
with director/co-writer Mike Cahill. Mike said he would consider bringing the film to Cape May (you bet I
asked him!), so fingers crossed. This is a film about regrets, redemptionits beautifully told, brilliantly
acted, and remarkably filmed.",1408406400,11,2446,4.744131455399061

4519884,5,B00518JDWW,"ANOTHER EARTH (2011) stars Brit Marling (born 1983) and William Mapother (born 1965).  Mr. Mapother is a cousin of you-know-who.  Ms. Marling plays a character named Rhoda.  Rhoda is about 20 years old.  As a teenager, Rhoda was interested in the planetary sciences, and was accepted as a student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but her plans were cut short by an automobile accident. Mr. Mapother plays a composer and former music professor at Yale University.  His lifestyle was interrupted by the same accident.  The film seems to provide a handful of profound notions, suitable as food for thought.  I am not exactly sure what these notions are.  I am not even sure if the notions set forth by this film are reasonable.  However, the profound notions that seem to be implied by this film, if they do exist, do make the film more interesting.  If it was not for these implied ""profound notions,"" this movie might be just another drama.  The theme of a second planet Earth, where counterparts of all of us Earthlings live, has been the subject of other films, that is, a Twilight Zone episode called THE PARALLEL (1963), JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN (1969), and THE STRANGER (1973).  ANOTHER EARTH  is more a psychological drama, and not really a science fiction movie.

OPENING SCENE.  The opening moments feature electronic trance music, and a fast-motion footage of Jupiter.  Rhoda says, ""I was 17 when I got my acceptance letter from MIT, I felt like anything was possible, and it was.""  (This is an ominous statement, because the storyline shows that ""anything,"" which takes the form of a horrible accident, was indeed possible.)  The next scene shows Rhoda driving her car with the radio proclaiming the discovery of a new planet.  The same scene shows the composer (Mr. Burroughs) parked at an intersection at night, talking with his wife and young son.  Rhoda's car smacks into Burroughs' car, and kills the wife and son.  Rhoda gets out and walks around, examining the injured people.

PRISON.  The next scene is only ten seconds long, and it shows Rhoda in a prison cell.  (This shows the great economy and intelligence in pacing used in ANOTHER EARTH.  Ten seconds is quite enough to do the job at conveying the fact of the four year prison sentence.)  The next scene takes place four years later, and we see Rhoda checking out of prison.  A television in the prison shows a news story, regarding the new planet.  Rhoda's brother picks her up, and takes her home to her mom and dad, and she goes into her bedroom which she'd not seen in four years.  The mother says, ""Hmm, is it good to be home?  You know, if you need anything . . . towels . . . goodnight.""  Immediately, Rhoda is on her computer, looking up UNITED SPACE VENTURES, which invites writing samples for a contest for a rocket ride to the newly discovered planet, called ""Earth2.""

In the next scene, Rhoda is at an employment agency.  The clerk knows that Rhoda is of exceptional intelligence (she got into MIT), but Rhoda insists, ""I don't want to be around too many people or do too much talking.""  And so, she gets a job as a janitor at a public school.  At this point, the music is like that of ORCHESTRAL MANOEUVRES IN THE DARK.

EXISTENTIAL SCENE.  In a mysterious scene by a municipal beach, a young man drops off a toy transformer robot at the base of a telephone pole.  Rhoda is nearby, and she walks over to the telephone pole and looks at the toy.  (That's all there is of this scene.  This scene makes this film seem like an existentialist movie from the 1950s.)

IMPORTANT PLOT ELEMENTS.  In the next scene, Rhoda looks up the man who's life she ruined by the car accident.  He is composer John Burroughs.  She decides to pose as an employee of a fictional clean-up company called, MAID IN HAVEN, and she goes to the man's house, located in a rural community not far from New Haven.  Her goal is that this, somehow, would enable her to apologize for her crime, and to somehow come to terms with herself.  Back at home, Rhoda completes her essay for UNITED SPACE VENTURES, where the essay includes the information that important explorations in the past, utilized ""people living on the edge of life, madmen, orphans, and ex-convicts like myself.""  (This is a very clever part of this movie.  Great job!)  As the viewer might guess at this point in the movie, Rhoda will be named the winner of the contest.

ALIENATION SCENE.  In a scene in a grocery store, Rhoda runs into a former high school friend.  He is a boy with his girlfriend.  ""Are you working"" asks the boy.  ""I work at West Haven School,"" she answers.  ""What do you teach?"" asks the boy.  ""I clean,"" she answers, referring to her janitorial job.  ""Its probably very therapeutic,"" concludes the boy.  The boy's girlfriend tries to be polite, and obviously does not want to communicate to Rhoda.  This very short scene communicates Rhoda's sense of alienation.

At Mr. Burroughs' house, Rhoda announces her service, Maid in Haven.  ""No thank you,"" says Burroughs, who is dressed like a slob and wears a stocking cap.  But he changes his mind a second later, and invites her in.  A dozen empty wine bottles are on a table,  disorganized stacks of books are here and there, stacks of dirty dishes are in the sink, and all of the paint on the walls is cracked.  (I have seen the same thing happen to a grieving person who lost a close relative due to cancer.)

MUSIC MAKES ITS APPEARANCE.  Rhoda spots a saw owned by Burroughs, but she does not realize that Burroughs uses it as a musical instrument.  Rhoda does some cleaning, then returns home to her parents and brother.  The saw makes another appearance in this movie, at one of the turning points in the movie.

In the next scene, Rhoda practices a speech for giving to Burroughs, expressing sorrow for killing his wife and son, but in the following weeks, the opportunity to give this speech never arrives.  So far in this movie, Rhoda and Mr. Burroughs act like zombies.  Both are in the state of grief, and this state taints every moment of every day.  Burroughs gives Rhoda a check for $50, but on her subway trip home, she rips it up.  The music at this point in the movie is like that from Australian band, THE SEVERED HEADS.

PLANETARY SCIENCE FORMS A BOND.  On her third trip to Mr. Burroughs' house, Rhoda shows an interest in a telescope, but she does not notice that Burroughs sees her taking this interest in the telescope.  Burroughs admires Rhoda for being interested in this telescope, but at this point in time, does not communicate this admiration.  Of course, he has absolutely no knowledge of the fact that she'd gotten accepted at MIT, or that her career goal at one time was planetary science.

COMMUNICATION WITH RESIDENT OF EARTH2.  The next scene shows Rhoda and her family watching a television broadcast, showing a scientist talking with her double who lives on Earth2.  The voice-over provides some pop-philosophy concerning whether it would be possible to improve one's life by talking to one's duplicate on Earth2.  (It is possible that this pop-philosophy is total nonsense --  however, it does make the film more interesting.)

ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY.  The next scene shows the start of recovery, from their zombie-state, for Rhoda and also for Burroughs.  Burroughs invites Rhoda to look through his telescope to see Earth2, and she accepts, and looks through the telescope.  Burroughs receives a take-out lunch from a delivery clerk, and Burroughs asks Rhoda if she will sit in the livingroom, and share the lunch.  She accepts.  Then, Burroughs asks Rhoda if she will join her to play his Wii game.  Rhoda accepts.  This is probably the first time in four years that either of them smiled or that either of them enjoyed being alive (sob, sob).  In the next scene, Rhoda tells a story about a Russian cosmonaut who is bothered by a mysterious tapping sound occurring in his spacecraft.  Rhoda says, ""He is up in space in the space closet . . . he realizes that the only way to save his sanity is to fall in love with the sound . . . he doesn't want to hear ticking any more, and instead he hears music.""  (Apparently, this story is some sort of allegory relating to the lives of Rhoda and Mr. Burroughs, however, it seems to be an imperfect allegory.  At any rate, the story of the tapping makes this movie more interesting.)

FURTHER ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY.  During another one of Rhoda's weekly cleaning visits, Burroughs invites Rhoda to hear him give a recital on the musical saw.  She accepts, and the two go to an auditorium apparently at Yale University, and he plays the musical saw for her.  Then, they return to Burroughs' house, and love happens.  The viewer will be treated to a brief scene revealing Brit Marling's yummy slender limbs (but that is all the viewer gets to see, too bad).

THE WINNER.  In the next scene, Rhoda's brother is playing basketball at home, and he asks, ""Do you want to get high?""  (The brother meant this as a joke, referring to the rocket trip to Earth2.)  The brother tells her that she got a phone call from UNITED SPACE VENTURES, because she won the essay contest.  The voice-over provides more pop-psychology, ""What would we like to see if we could stand outside ourselves and look at us?""  (Although this seems like nonsense, it is interesting, and makes the movie more intriguing.)

THE SECRET IS REVEALED.  Rhoda goes to Mr. Burroughs' house on another cleaning visit.  He is busy playing his piano, apparently the first time in four years.  The viewer will be glad for Mr. Burroughs and for is recovery from his grief.  He smiles when he sees Rhoda come in, and he smiles when she announces that she won the contest and will be traveling to Earth 2.  He pours drinks to celebrate, saying, ""To the coming true of your most improbable dream,"" and he kisses her.  Then he realizes the danger of her space journey, and he begs her, ""Don't go, please don't go.  We're so close to something here.""  Then, Rhoda reveals that she was the teenager who killed the wife and son.  Burroughs replies, ""You better leave.  GET OUT. GET OUT NOW.""  The film has a surprise ending.  It is happy ending. I will not reveal it.  You need to buy the movie, if you want to learn the ending.  FIVE STARS.",1403308800,2,10286,4.619679380873411

She goes to jail for four years.  The punishment is necessary - but a longer one would serve no purpose.  Upon her release, the woman craves another existence, as it is too hard for her to move forward with this life.  At one point she lies down in the snow to die.  However all this time, another earth has been approaching, beautiful visually and beautiful as a symbol of hope for people who wish they could start over.  The young woman tries to give something back to the one surviving victim of her accident, however once he knows who she is, a reconciliation seems even less likely than the second chance planet that is awaiting.  A second viewing of this film is worthwhile, as the minimal plot is out of the way, and we are deeply moved by someone trying to find a way to live with what cannot be changed.

4519901,5,B00518JDWW,"Another Earth was both written and directed by Mike Cahill and stars Brit Marling and William Mapother as a woman with a dark past and the man whose life she ruined. The plot of the film revolves around Rhoda, a woman whose past prevents her from moving on with her life, and her attempts to reconcile with a man whose life she demolished years before. At this same time, a second Earth is discovered orbiting the sun, with every person having a copy of themselves on the other earth.

I heard about this movie from a friend, who had told me that it was one of the most moving and heartfelt movies he had seen in a long time. Intrigued, I rented it and watched it that night, and I was not disappointed. Another Earth is easily one of the most human and beautiful films that I have ever seen, which is especially remarkable due to the extremely low budget for the film. The acting is superb, with Brit Marling and William Mapother giving wonderful performances as two people who have both seen tragedy. The writing is also very well done, with Mike Cahill's script never losing sight of how the characters are feeling throughout  all of these events. If there were any faults to be had, it would be in the fact that the sci-fi part of the plot, while interesting, never really serves as anything more than a small but intriguing plot device. All in all, I would say that this is a wonderful movie, and that it is a must-see for anyone who appreciates fully engrossing dramas with wonderful character development.",1391472000,3,1512,4.514598540145985

In fact, the entire set-up of the story (over indulgence, a fatal car crash, four years in prison) all takes place within the first 10 minutes or so of the film, with no dialog and very little explanation (a brief voiceover).

4519918,2,B00518JDWW,"First off, I love science fiction and psychological drama type  movies and this one (Another Earth) was recommended to me as ""A have to see film.""  I should have suspected something was wrong since it did not do well at the box office; nevertheless, I was willing to take a chance and rented it.  In 2012 I saw the movie ""Take Shelter"" and it was the worst movie I ever saw that year.  This year I award ""Another Earth"" as the most boring hyped up movie of the year.

It was difficult to watch this film all the way through because there was so little dialog, drama and action until the end of the movie.  I know the pseudo-intellectual movie critics and Hollywood phonies praised this movie as a great work of creative genius. This movie proves those so called ""movie experts""  do not know anymore than the average person about movies.  In lay men's term that means it was a boring and goofy attempt to create a story which is supposed to have some mystical meaning that only those with a deeper intellect can grasp.

 The actual theme is not really science fiction, but a story about a young woman who at the beginning of the movie crashes her car into another car head on.  The wife and young child is killed in the auto accident and the woman goes to jail for four years.  After she is released she begins cleaning a school.

I am glad I did not purchase this film and only wasted about 92 minutes of my time watching this psychological study in lunacy.  If you enjoy watching a movie about a depressed young woman who walks a lot in the snow and cleans a school and winds up being the cleaning woman at a man's house, who is the person who lost his wife and child in the auto accident, this film is for you. I gave it two stars instead of one star because I felt the acting was good and the original hook about another Earth was very interesting.

My complaint goes beyond ""Another Earth"" to include many similarly fine films that make unforgivable mistakes and / or intentional embellishments.

The scene to which I refer is where Rhoda describes cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin's experiences during the first manned space shot.  Rhoda says Yuri was in space for ""28 days.""  Rhoda goes on to describe a totally fictional account of Gagarin's experiences.

Wikipedia states:  ""The spaceflight consisted of a single orbit of the Earth (to this date the shortest orbital manned spaceflight). According to official records, the spaceflight took 108 minutes from launch to landing.""
Gagarin completed one orbit of the Earth.

What I never understand is this:  Why take an exceptional film and tarnish it with wrong information on easily checked facts?  The scene with Rhoda describing the repetitive sound in the space capsule and the musical correlation was in no way central the the movie.  Surely something else equally provocative and interesting could have been done without such a dramatic distortion of facts that every schoolboy knows.

But it's not. It's a brilliant movie about life choices, and consequences of actions, and how we try to right past wrongs. The ""second Earth"" is part of the story line, but a very minor one.

4519938,4,B00518JDWW,"Brit Marling's acting in this film is exceptionally affecting, in a story stemming from the idea that in a universe that seems infinitely large, odds are that everything exists more than once.  And if you consider the earth as only a geological  thing, this idea may be relatively easy to get your mind around.  But if, as this movie seems to do, you consider the second earth to comprise not just the identical geological object but also identical duplicates of each and every living entity on it, then the concept is harder to accept.  And especially when this improbable phenomenon is also in easy viewing distance from your hometown.

But movies require some suspension of disbelief, and if we manage it for this one, we can share in Rhoda Williams' eagerness to migrate to the second earth, in effect turning back the clock and placing her in a world where her terrible misdeed never happened and where her new friend, the professor still has his happy family.  At the end, I'm wondering about the logistics of having two Rhodas.  Can the newly arrived Rhoda simply live a life away from the family on her new planet, so that they never know of her existence?

For the most part, it is not a sci-fi story, it is a love story, a story of the terrible tragedies that surround us and sometimes curse us, and it is a story about forgiveness and living through terrible events. Finally, it was the ending that totally hooked me; it is not the usual ending given to film goers and novel readers, where everything is wrapped up neatly and fed to us as if we were stupid cattle.

Some scientist suggest that particle physics may allow for another universe which mirrors this one.  Maybe harboring another ""us"".  Maybe in the outer reaches of scientific logic, but still, an interesting movie concept.  The earth like planet making it's way into what appears to be lunar distance orbit is another matter, but it does make for a story with a new and refreshing approach.  Brit Marling is a naturally pretty and intelligent actress and plays this melancholy role in an extremely believable fashion.  I like the way the story was so realistically played with the tragic circumstances being what they were, while this astounding event was also about to take place.  The conclusion wasn't shocking.

As far as the movie, it's pretty intellectual, pretty deep. It's important that you know it's not a sci-fi movie. It's a drama that uses the ""sci-fi"" as a metaphorical driver of the film's theme which should relate to anyone who's ever had a regret. Though there's some lack of polish with the music and writing, Mike Cahill and Brit Marling have crafted another beautiful film that will leave you thinking.

I would love to own this movie. Unfortunately, I'm not willing to pay $20 for a DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital combo when I don't have a Blu-Ray player and rarely watch movies on my computer.

4519957,3,B00518JDWW,"While I didn't find this film a complete waste of time, it left far too many questions for my busy mind to hash over for hours afterward.

Possible Spoiler Alert:
Since the plot has aready been discussed here many times I'lk skip it and just go on with how I felt. I could connect with the chacter of Rhoda in the sense of feeling so lost and empty over things that happened in the past that you simply can not change. I had the feeling that if she would have had the chance to explain herself to John when she wanted to originally, it would have been met in a worse manor than it eventually is. She feels that she wants to do the right thing but hasn't figured out yet at her young age that sometimes things are best left alone to be dealt with on your own. Her developing friendship and eventual love for him and him for her I could understand because you had two very ""lost soul"" kind of people that were drawn to each other, each for their own reasons. At that point Rhoda should have never told him who she really was. It did seem self-serving and only done to ease her own mind at that point. How did she expect him to react knowing that he had had sex with the woman who killed his family?

What bothered me the most was how Earth 2 was such a back story that we never really learn (unless I missd it while I ran to the bathroom)when or how did it materialize. Did everyone just wake up one morning and there was a mirror image of the earth? Since I never saw more than one moon, was there a second moon or was that our moon with the new earth between us? Of course, that adds the questions of lunar pull, tides, gravity and a plethora of other questions wide open that never get answered. I wanted to know these things and that alone would make a great sci-fi film without the Rhoda-John storyline.

It also brings up the question of did the same drawing take place on Earth 2, with Rhoda winning and coming here to Earth 1 to find her other self. That would have left 2 John's on Earth 2 since it appeared from Rhoda's dress that she must have gone to MIT and her life went as planned without the accident causing the death of John's family. The whole quantum physics/parallel realities theory freaks me out enough as it is. What if suddenly four more earths would have just popped into exisitence?

I did find it an interesting Indie film that left far too many questions even for a film that wanted people to think afterward and come up with possible ending scenarios on their own. While I do enjoy films that leave something to think about at the end, this one left me thinking far too much about far too much.",1367193600,2,2622,4.227544910179641

  *****************Spoilers***************

Physics: There is no way you could have another planet that close without disrupting everything on both planets from the gravitational effect. How did the other planet get there anyway? Where is its sun?

How does the little kid get thrown forward out of the car, through the windshield when they were sitting still at the time of the accident? Did the force disintegrate the seatbelt it shows him wearing?

Human nature: Anyone heard about the story when War of the Worlds was broadcast in 1938? While there is debate how much panic actually happened, a world travelling towards ours, close enough to view detail through an old telescope? Yeah, that wouldn't be pretty.

Extraneous scenes: The magic colored man added nothing to the movie (I'm not sure what nationality he was. It was unclear.) That entire section could have been cut. Her attempted suicide had no effect other than some bandages on her fingers, and was never mentioned again. No therapy, no health issues, nothing. Laying naked in the snow to the point you look dead has more health effects than that.

So after sitting through all the boring angst, the horrifying relationship she forms with him, etc, the girl gives the guy her ticket to the other earth (not sure why the company would allow that, she won a contest, it was big publicity.) Then four months later, she's coming around the side of a house, and sees her other self standing by the garage. The end. WTF?

I should have known better than to watch a Sundance film without reading reviews first.

It would have been a much, much better movie if they had just left out the ""science"" fiction part. Then the people who like this kind of movie would have seen it, and the rest of us would have been spared.

4519972,5,B00518JDWW,"Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling) is a brilliant student with a bright future, until vehicular manslaughter lands her behind bars. John Burroughs (William Mapother) is a promising composer whose life is irrevocably damaged when a hapless teen driver kills his family and puts him in a coma. Flash forward to four years after the accident as John and Rhoda are restarting their lives. Little do they realize, Earth II is about to bring them together in a way that neither could predict or ever comprehend.

Another Earth revolves around Rhoda and John and the relationship they develop in the aftermath of the accident. Both, each in their own way, have become estranged from the world around them, mere shells of their former selves. She being wracked with guilt, decides one day to visit John and express her deepest regrets and sorrow. What she finds is a total mess of a man, and in a moment of weakness, she buckles. Instead telling him who she is and why she's there she can only offer, in the smallest of gestures, to help him clean up his life. Eventually, Rhoda becomes his salvation and John, hers. The two broken souls become involved in a torrid love affair until an unexpected opportunity leaves their relationship at a crossroads. Rhoda is now faced with the decision to tell John who she really is and what she's done. And if she does, can he still love her?

Don't let the name fool you, because Another Earth isn't really about another Earth. Another Earth is about redemption, forgiveness and the impact of second chances. It's a powerful film that captures both the imagination and the heart. This little indie film was born of grandiose vision while simultaneously facilitating deeper introspection which renders this particular viewer at a loss for words. In short, I felt ALL THE FEELS. And let me be honest, it isn't an easy movie to watch. It'll punch you in the gut, leave you conflicted and wondering ""what if?"". The entire time I was stuck in a love/hate battle with Rhoda and her situation, but at the same time, I couldn't help but care about the poor girl. She's got a good heart despite some of the questionable choices she makes. By the end, you learn to not judge as you ask yourself ""what would you do if you were in her shoes."" Spoiler Alert: It's not an easy question to answer.

A little more drama than sci-fi, Cahill has done the impossible in making us realize you don't need millions of dollars accompanied by a frenzy of CGI SFX to leave a lasting impact. Sure, the science is slightly questionable but it doesn't really matter because the whole Earth II thing takes a total backseat to the relationship between our main characters. Watching it blossom and bloom and whither is a tragically beautiful thing. By the end of the movie, left open to interpretation, the one thing we learn is that forgiveness and truth lay in the inner spaces of our hearts rather than an entire universe away.

Food for Thought: Another Earth is remarkable indie film full of heart and soul. It's one of those movies that makes you think and wonder ""will she, won't she,"" the entire time. You're given more questions than answers but it's satisfying to be given the power to draw your own conclusions.

4519977,4,B00518JDWW,"ANOTHER EARTH is a thoughtful, introspective examination of guilt and redemption.  The film centers on 17-year-old Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling), all set to begin her future at MIT, who accidentally causes the deaths of a pregnant mother and her young son.  After four years in prison, Rhoda tries to come to terms with what she has done by reaching out to the pregnant woman's husband, John Burroughs (William Mapother; Ethan from LOST), who survived the accident.  They form an uneasy friendship that slowly grows into something more personal, but by keeping her true identity secret, Rhoda is clearly jeopardizing the very redemption she seeks.

You'll note that I have not yet mentioned the ""mirror planet"" discovered in the film, nor have I used the words ""science fiction"" to describe it.  Yes, another planet, apparently identical to Earth, is discovered on the night of Rhoda's tragic accident.  Yes, we learn that this planet is inhabited by people who seem to be identical to the ones living on Earth.  We learn about this through various television and radio reports, and we see lovely images of this beautiful planet hovering in the heavens above Rhoda and John.

But this isn't a science fiction film.  It's a somber and serious effort to unravel the very real horrors of facing one's flaws, looking oneself in the eye, and accepting what will never be perfect - maybe not even close.  Rhoda must learn to understand who she was that night when she was 17, and who she is now, at 21.  John must face his loss and his anger, and figure out how to move forward with his life.

The existence of the parallel planet is a device through which the film can pose its questions:  If you could meet another ""you,"" what would you do?  What would you say?  What would you ask?  What could you learn from yourself?  That's the biggest question of all.  Rhoda and John are lost, and inevitably connected because of that loss.  It's possible that the only people who can help them find their way again are . . . themselves.

Those looking for a science fiction film about a parallel planet will be disappointed.  There is very little ""science"" in this particular fiction.  The presence of the planet makes little sense in physical reality, and it really serves more as a metaphor for all the ""if onlys"" we tend to whisper in our darkest moments.  If only there was another chance, another beginning, another reality, another Earth . . .

I liked ANOTHER EARTH, but it wasn't what I expected.  And its science fiction aspects (including the idea that either Rhoda or John could ever find real solace on this parallel planet) are its weakest elements.

But I sat through the whole thing, and I felt like this movie was empty of emotion and empty of content. How can one connect with any of these characters when only their shell is being presented? That's how I felt. Okay, she was tortured and you will know why right from the beginning, and the gentleman is tortured, as well. But there is no depth. If the gentleman's family would have been presented more, maybe the hurt would be more meaningful.

I also felt like the aspect of the 2nd planet earth was a footnote, not really an important part of the story. It was just a way out of the sadness the characters were in.

Meanwhile, we find out the ""something"" in the sky is another Earth that is exactly the same as ours.

Review: The movie itself is fairly original.  I was hooked in the beginning but after a while, the story of the main character and the father dragged on.  I don't think the movie was trying to find a deeper meaning in anything other worldly, which was the opposite of what I was expecting just from the title.  The ending was interesting but is pretty easily deduced if you pay attention to the news casts.  The cinematography was beautiful and was probably the most enjoyable part of this film.",1346284800,,942,4.598802395209581

4519992,4,B00518JDWW,"A profoundly moving film about tragedy and second chances, ""Another Earth"" is science fiction in only the broadest sense (in fact it truly is a fantasy)--out of the blue we see another Earth in the sky. Is it some sort of bizarre mirror image due to a fluke in physics or could it truly be a parallel world with a door that has just opened for both them and us? The science for those that care about it is sketchy to say the least as the film ignores the impact of having another planet the size of Earth in our solar system and how the close planet might impact our tides, gravity, etc. Instead, director Mike Cahill uses the story as a metaphor for his themes.

If you're looking for a science fiction adventure or one that focuses on the other Earth that mysteriously appears in the sky, ""Another Earth"" is the wrong movie for you. If you're looking for a drama that doesn't answer all the questions posed, deals with the themes of loss and the complexity of relationships, than ""Another Earth"" is for you.

SPOILERS:

For Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling who also co-wrote the film)when that doorway between us and them occurs it  provides for the possibility of hope and second chances. Rhoda has just been released from prison after serving a sentence for manslaughter when, after celebrating her acceptance to MIT, drunkenly hits another car killing the family of a composer John Burroughs(William Mapother)and leaving him in a coma. Four years later Rhoda is adrift and feels the need to apologize to Burroughs. When she visits him she finds he is as much adrift and lost as she is. She lies to him telling him that she is with a cleaning service and offering a free trial cleaning. He takes her up on it and they begin a complex relationship as a result. Meanwhile, Rhoda applies to travel on a private expedition to Earth 2 to find out if it is real and if, as many believe, it parallels our world with other versions of us there.

END OF SPOILERS:

I enjoyed ""Another Earth"" although it's pacing is a bit slow (not that unusual for an Indie film which focuses less on rapid cutting styles and more on mood and character). The performances by Marling and Mapother are exceptionally good.

The Blu-ray looks quite an inconsistent but largely decent looking transfer. There is considerable video noise evident The film was shot in 720p (and upscaled)and, as a result, it isn't going to exhibit a huge jump up from the look of a DVD but it does look better than the DVD on average. Although there are flaws the movie, on the whole, looks good.

The audio is quite good although keep in mind this isn't an action film so dialogue and music clarity are the priority here.

There are deleted scenes (including a scene that suggests how Earth 2's gravity might impact our world although it is quite unbelievable). We also get a music video by Fall on Your Sword the group that scored the film. We also get featurettes with Marling, Mapother and director Cahill discussing the making of the film. Finally we get a featurette where Marling and Cahill sit down with a astrophysicist to discuss alternate universes, worlds and what it means to us. The trailer is included upscaled to 1080p.

If you keep in mind that ""Another Earth"" is a drama about consequences, loss and second chances rather than the planet mentioned in the title, you'll enjoy this drama. If you're looking for a science fiction adventure, you've picked the wrong movie.",1346025600,3,3436,4.627257799671593

4519994,5,B00518JDWW,"brit marling is like a dream, and the movie is more like her beautiful but disturbed interruption upon wake:  we, the viewers are watching her story unfold.  this isn't like an ordinary 'movie', set so differently from real life, or that the actors are separated from their trailers and coffee breaks, to the players and costumes they portray.  this is like watching a woman, behind a raspberry bush, following her as she walks through life, brilliant, suffocated, ashamed, gracious.  she's the most beautiful, kind-hearted, warm-intentioned 'criminal' i've ever watched upon the screen - and thus the most realistic.  i've rarely been able to hold a piece of the actor's heart, and intentions, into my own personal life - i've, sure, been able to escape into brad pitt's biceps in 'fight club', been thrown off guard by keira's rosy cheeks and beauty in 'atonement', wished my life could be as dangerous and wonderful as the scoundrels in gregg araki's films, but i've rarely felt as approachable to those characters.  if i saw them in real life, i would most likely feel fat, ugly, unhip, unmodelesque, un-actory.  brit is someone i Want to meet, be friends with, look at, despite her looks or actions.  she isn't even acting, in a sense.  she's connecting with another persona, but using her words, glimpses, thoughts, like she would as if making a present for her mum, presenting a graduation speech, listening to a friend as she reaches out in tears... she's all about connecting, and honesty.  she's just like you and i - if we could care less about weight, or impressing our parents - deciding to be in a film and use a new kind of media for discovering about the poetry of life, science, space, people, pain... It's one of those films that will be overlooked, turned down, judged voraciously, but only because it isn't immediate, but it is also the most captivating piece i have watched in a long time.  it wasn't uncomfortable, cliche, frustrating, nor depressing for me.  it was inspiring to see her struggle, heart breaking to know i could be in that same situation and learn the same road - lose my friends, want to die, feel honestly dis-tached from family, and take haven in others stories rather than my own.  it was breath taking to see so many metaphors and music put together - the cello playing every time brit entered the scene, tumbling on rocks, or the piano and cello chaotically together when she made love with the other.  or the way the first human she saw after being set free... was a man in an alien costume. the irony.  or how the astrophysicist chose to speak to the alternate Her from planet 2, asking about Astro Strawberries and when she was 7, instead of the terrified or panicked beacons that governmental employees are known to embark, when speaking to extraterrestrial forms. it's also infuriating how this got a 64 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and that the general public found it dull, repetitive, and over-dramaticized, where i found it fresh, completely realistic, and clenching.

the kind of movie where blowing your nose or taking off your shoe - a three second act that removes you from the screen - was enough to make me rewind, and capture those seconds lost.  the kind where after watching, i told everyone i knew in proximity - all of my roommates and my friend that day later, to 'watch this movie, no matter what'.  the kind that isn't even a movie, really, but a piece that i was fortunate enough to see, that didn't use gimmicks or flash to attract me, and is what movies should Aspire to be.

it's also one that will be a classic, cult or general, in years to come.  the kind that isn't favored by the public or critics initially, but is well-traveled down the road, for being something new, broad, sweeping, and challenging.  the kind where you Want to be in the main character's shoes, be gawked at by the same brother, make love to the same man, throw up elegantly on the same train toilet, stare at the same flock of birds, and tuck the same lock of hair behind the ear, but don't want to, because only she can be as beautiful and honest, as herself.

please give this another thought.  at least appreciate it for it's power to invoke a primal emotion, rather than immediate excitement and then forgetfulness.",1345334400,8,4273,4.683155080213904
4519995,3,B00518JDWW,"I liked this movie. It was thought provoking, touching and actress, Brit Marling, was absolutely stunning and radiating. When I first was exposed to this movie, it was through the trailer, which was not very indicative of what the movie is actually like. It's not a science fiction film.

The story is simple; 17 year old, aspiring M.I.T. bound college student, ""Rhoda"" celebrates her anticipated life trajectory but, while driving,  slams into a car killing a pregnant wife, young son and rendering the husband and father into a coma. The victim never learns about the indentity of Rhoda because she was a juvenile. Rhoda serves four years in prison and when she comes out, she is guilt-ridden and defeated. She decides to confront her surviving victim andapologize to the man but, she chickens out when she meets with him. Instead, she innocuosly enters into his life and they build a gradual relationship that blossums into romance. Since the truth in the revelation is inevitable, you can see where and how the conflict of the movie will develop.

While this drama is onfolding, a second Earth emerges in the sky that is reachable by conventional space exploration. This ""set up"" is hardly scientifically possible, or even addressed, but this ""other earth"" is what provides this film it's emotional charge. The second earth is deemed a mirror image of this earth so, if you exists here, then you exist there. The pondered consideration is would your mirror image be the same or different? Would a bad decision here, which completely alters a life, be different there, without that bad decision? Would Rhoda be a sucessful M.I.T. student on Earth 2? Would the widower have his wife and son still alive on Earth 2?

This movie is about second chances, what ifs, and redemption. It's about the unrealistic premise of avoiding a painful fate.

Now, as I stated earlier, I liked this movie. It had moments of beauty, wonderful poignancy and stark drama. The two main actors were great in that they were very real, genuine and likeable. Specifically, actress Brit Marling is a captivating and she truly illuminates the screen.

What makes the movie good also, ironically, detracts from it. This is an ""indie"" picture and it shows. With a shaky camera, very often too dark lighting, choppy editing, and lack of narrative,  the movie doesn't flow as well as it should. The lighting is truly bothersome but, maybe that is done purposely since the dark tints allows actress Brit Marling, with her beautiful blonde flowing hair and pretty smile, to truly light up that darkness when the camera zooms up on her.

I would imagine that a bold movie like this, with it's subject matter and using the sci-fi angle as an allegory, could only be made through the indie channels so, I guess, it is what it is.

This movie could touch a person, that also had a life altering incident, in a manner quite different from my own. I have been lucky to have a blessed life but a person that could empathize with the characters in this movie may view this movie in a different, very therapeuatic light and love that optimism that ""Another Earth""  conveys. Hence, I could see why someone may give it stellar reviews.

I was thinking what if this movie was re-made, but on a big budget, what it be better? I don't think so because  I feel that actress, Brit Marling, is what really established this fine, yet certainly not perfect, film.",1345334400,,3412,4.774193548387097

4519999,4,B00518JDWW,"Another Earth is not a perfect film; it can feel clunky and inert at moments. It is, however, a fairly well crafted piece of art that will get one thinking about...possibilities. I will try to make this review short, sweet and (major) spoiler free.

Our protagonist- a brilliant and beautiful teenager, well trained in astronomy- finds herself at the heart of an unthinkable tragedy, in the blink of an eye. Her life changes via chance (or fate), all the while the world around her is transforming. This is a story of love, loss, uncertainty and redemption. Those turning to this film for CGI and sci-fi glam will be sorely disappointed in this picture.

My best advice is to approach this movie with a completely open mind. The science behind this motion picture is highly questionable and likely deemed as ""bad science"" to those actually versed in science (two earths would inevitably affect the tides via gravitational pull of moons...). If you can overlook the flawed scientific logic and focus on the film's emotive aspects instead, you may get a satisfying experience out of viewing this movie.

Another Earth is a character study more so than a science fiction feature. It's also a tragic love story in an abstract sense. Though in essence ""Another Earth"" is riding along the wave of ""end of the world"" or ""end of the world as we know it"" films (think ""Melancholia"" & the terrible ""4:44""), it can stand on its own as a solid drama. The pace is slow and steady; there are no flashy twists or frills to be had here. The cinematography is stunning in points, but never for vanity's sake. Everything about this film feels well thought and deliberate(despite the fact that it is not treading brand new ground all in all...).

4520003,4,B00518JDWW,"This small independent production is the first feature film of Mike Cahill and Brit Marling. What could have been a rather mundane tale of romance and redemption for two people impacted by the same tragedy is, however, raised to something more by two things. First the acting is absolutely top notch. William Mapother (better known for ""In the Bedroom"" and ""Lost"") is a familiar face and strong actor. Brit Marling, however, is nothing short of amazing in her lead role as Rhonda Williams. The fact Marling co-wrote the screenplay undoubtedly assisted her in immersing herself in the character. This role puts her in the same league with Jennifer Lawrence after her breakout film ""Winter's Bone.""

What also sets this film apart is the combining of two separate genres; romantic drama and science fantasy. Without engaging in plot spoilers, Marling plays a high school senior celebrating early acceptance into M.I.T.'s astro-physics programs by having a couple of drinks. While driving home, she hears of a new planet discovered which is a mirror image of earth. She looks out the window to try and glimpse the planet plowing into the car of John Burroughs (Mapother) a music professor and nearby Yale University. Burrough's wife and young son are instantly killed and he is in a coma. Instead of M.I.T., Williams spends nearly 4 years in jail for vehicular manslaughter. After release, she finds Burroughs has come out of the coma. Much of the film centers on a relationship that develops between them, focusing on how they cope with their grief.

The secondary plot, which runs concurrently, explores the existence of the new planet which has come much closer, and turns out to be a ""Another Earth"" an exact copy down to the existence of the same people. This development sets up the possibility of what it might be like if you could visit another planet and find a ""Doppelg&auml;nger"", an exact replica of yourself you could see from the outside. While the plot may at times strain credulity, it does so no more than a good episode of The Twilight Zone, and leaves viewers much to ponder at the end.

While hardly perfect, films like these this one tend to renew my faith in movies at a time when too many studio p[roductions feel pre-packaged and predictable. As for Brit Marling, I can't wait for her next film, ""Sound of My Voice"">",1341532800,,2337,4.8375

4520006,4,B00518JDWW,"As most people have mentioned, the sci-fi aspects support the narrative in this film and propel the characters forward as opposed to the converse where the actors fall prey to becoming mere props facilitating the action sequences and sci-fi twists. In other words, the underlying theme of ""things not being what they are supposed to be"" is prominent but serves as the backdrop setting for the emotional journey the characters are undertaking. This concept may seem boring, and sadly it isn't box office material. However, this isn't to say the film doesn't have its proper place in cinema; I would simply have a hard time categorizing it as pure entertainment. Like 2001 - A Space Odyssey, this film has the capacity of reaching out to all individuals because of the universal subject matter it speaks of, in this film specifically shame, guilt and atoning for one's trespasses, whether they are deliberate or not.

The empowerment of Another Earth comes from its ability to make the audience feel present effectively blurring the line between audience and screen. This magic originates from a good screenplay, decent acting, great cinematography and brilliant story-telling instead of relying on the substantial use of computer graphics or 3-d effects. Some may see this as the problem of the film while the majority (from the reviews I've read) will appreciate the unembellished surface and distinct soundness the filmmakers have created.

I won't kid you, like other viewers I also questioned the validity of the premise - a planet like ours popping out of nowhere? Come on, get real. And then, once I had accepted the possibility of a planet emerging, I started asking myself how it could even be possible for a second planet to exist so closely to the original Earth without interfering with our gravitational pull. I'd like to believe that the filmmakers chose not to address the questions rather than ignoring them completely; if so, I can only theorize they did so in an effort at maintaining the integrity of the story they were telling against turning the film into an episode of NOVA.

Bottom line: The premise is simple yet compelling and lends itself to an experience you either regard as thoughtful or insipid, with strong dramatic tension leading the charge as the story is set in motion. However, I would pass this film up if you feel unanswered questions will annoy/disturb you; accepting the questions as accommodating in the same manner explosions are specifically audible in all Star Wars films (sound in space?) will allow you to adjust your viewing stance and recognize the insight of Another Earth.",1339459200,3,2621,5.006880733944954
4520007,5,B00518JDWW,"I have to admit, there are few films that have literally blown me away in the same way that `Another Earth' has.  The combination of unique visual, emotional and dramatic approach have left me somewhat `conformed', completely overwhelmed by the beauty and unexpected poignancy of this little film.  The reviews were strong, the critical reception was telling, the awards recognition was respectable for such a small film and the cult following continues to grow.

You can count me in that cult!

`Another Earth' is a beautifully sharp character study disguised as a science fiction film.  The film opens with a still of Jupiter and then follows that up with a tragic accident that claims the life of a young woman, her unborn daughter and her son.  Her husband, who was also in that car, survived the crash, spent some time in a coma, and has basically lived his life since a shell of his former self; drinking away his sorrow in his filthy home.  The young woman responsible for the accident, seventeen year old Rhoda who is excited about her acceptance to MIT and completely obsessed with space, has spent four years in prison for her recklessness.  Upon her release, her depression grows and she eventually finds herself placing herself in this man's life in order to `help him' and in a way `help herself'.  The strength of this narrative would suffice in itself, but there is more here that adds to the depth of this story.  Hovering overhead (in beautiful visionary presence) is another Earth, an Earth 2 that was recently discovered (actually, it was discovered on the night of the accident) and it holds within its mystery the prospect of a different future.  As the understanding of that planet becomes clearer and Rhoda begins to contemplate her `other self', the depth of pain is exemplified as the question arises `what if, in another world, you didn't make the same mistakes you made in this one?'

Visually, this is just as striking as it is emotionally.  The cinematography is breathtaking, reminding me of 2010's `Fish Tank' in the way that it frames the most intimate of rooms to feel suffocating and in other frames almost uplifting (the floating dust particles is a nice touch), and the visual effect of the `other Earth' is stunning.  Brit Marling is such a find.  Not only did she help pen this story, but her performance is so grounded and revealing and she never lets go of what makes Rhoda tick.  You can feel that pain seep out of her, but you also feel the emotional uplift as she begins to `forget' in order to move on.  William Mapother is also very well used here, delivering a shattering portrayal of a man who has lost everything and is desperately clinging to what he thinks is going to replace that hole in his soul.

I'm so excited to see where Marling and director Mike Cahill go from here!",1339372800,,2825,4.695740365111562
4520008,5,B00518JDWW,"""Another Earth"" is truly science fiction as art, and certain to be one of my favorite movies of the year, possibly even entering my all-time top 10 (putting it in the company of ""Donnie Darko"", ""Babe"", and ""Blue Velvet""). I highly recommend it; it is beautiful, profound, touching, melancholy, and sad.

I will often get goose bumps when experiencing a work of art that truly moves me, be it music, a painting, a movie, whatever. I got goose bumps more often watching ""Another Earth"" than any other movie I have ever seen--and I watch hundreds a year.

Some have complained that ""Another Earth"" isn't truly science fiction, for example because the gravitational affects of the other earth aren't shown. If you read about the production, you'll find that there was indeed a scene exploring that, but it was cut out of the film. Good, I say, and I saw the perfect response to that complaint on some blog somewhere (or possibly left as a note on another review here): Metaphors don't have gravity.",1339286400,,994,4.7398843930635834

4520010,4,B00518JDWW,"I watched  this movie at least 4 or 5 times. I knew there was a deeper meaning by understanding the ""Another Earth"". I felt there was so many unresolved questions by the way the movie ended. The strange twists towards the end of the movie really perplexed me. I would set the movie aside for several days, even months and then watch it again.

Both Rhoda and John Burroughs are psychologically damaged after the tragedy that both were involved in. Rhoda and John come to find great comfort in each other. But, John doesn't know who Rhoda really is. She's the person that caused the tragedy that killed Johns wife and son. Rhoda really wants to apologize for the unforgivable tragedy, but she's unable to because of the shame and weakness she feels. The comfort that John and Rhoda are experiencing together is based upon a deep and shameful lie that prevents redemption and healing. Towards the end of the movie Rhoda is finally able to tell the truth. After that truth is known Rhoda and John are finally able to see them selves.

The story is profound because it addresses the fragmented aspects of ourselves. We are whole and complete when we can see and accept these parts of ourselves. Another Earth is a symbol for that other self that has become fragmented, unseen and unwanted. Accepting the ""Another Earth"" is the healing process not only for Rhoda, but for John Burroughs. The movie has strong esoteric underlying theme of healing ourselves on Earth. That healing would result in ""Another Earth"".",1338595200,2,1506,4.740458015267175
4520011,4,B00518JDWW,"To set a few things straight, ""Another Earth"" IS a sci-fi film in the strictest sense of the word, but do not go into it thinking of it that way.  It depends upon a suspension of disbelief but let's delay that discussion that for a moment.

The plot is pretty straightforward: Rhoda, a bright, young girl headed to MIT leaves a party and takes her eyes off the road because her car radio announces a mysterious new planet is visible in the night sky.  Just as she spots it she slams into another car, killing a man's pregnant wife and child and leaving him in a coma.

Four years later she leaves prison a ruined young woman, barely able to speak to anyone.  She takes a job as a janitor at a high school, probably fulfilling some testament to the ruination of her own educational dreams.  And when she tracks down the man whose family she destroyed, she flubs that, too, and ends up lying to him and telling him she's from a cleaning service, and she cleans his home every week for him.

That's mostly it, but at the same time it isn't it at all.  So much goes on in terms of mood, posture, the length of the shot, and almost always the ever-enlarging aura of the other planet, one that seems to be mirroring us in every way.

And that's where the really interesting dilemma comes in: could an earth that is SO much like ours--one that very well might have been EXACTLY like ours until the moment we (and they) spotted one another--be infinitesimally different ENOUGH that Rhoda might be able to escape the horror of her life, and the wrong that she did that night, the very night we spotted each other?

I want to tell you more, but I worry so of spoiling it, which I will not do.  But there are three important things you should know about this film:

1.  Don't dwell on the picky questions that sci-fi people tend to dwell over and could ruin your enjoyment.  Don't wonder how this planet escaped our detection until now.  Don't worry about how it affects our tides, or orbits, or atmosphere, or any of the little nitpicky things that would get in your way.  Think of the sci-fi in a less demanding sense of, say, a ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Outer Limits"" TV episode.  It is absolutely necessary for the other earth to be there...it's just not something that demands scientific specificity.

2.  This is an independent film: low budget, hand-held cameras, occasional fuzzy shots, etc.  But it is not bothersome or ""Blair Witch""-y.  This is a nice, quiet drama that is thoughtful and serious, and ultimately packs a punch.  It has a terrific ending that I will continue to mull over for some time.

3.  An interesting note about the actors: William Mapother (Ethan from ""Lost"") is the man whose family was destroyed, and Brit Marling is a heretofore unknown actress who also wrote the movie...and it's a very good movie at that.  Both are pitch perfect in their respective roles, and this movie made me feel I was eavesdropping on two real people undergoing a very dramatic process.

Stay with ""Another Earth."" It is an extremely good film with an extremely powerful ending. .",1338249600,2,3073,4.521739130434782
4520012,4,B00518JDWW,"Another Earth was a thoughtful and reflective movie on how to a person can compensate for causing pain to another human being. I felt that the movie showed in a sensitive way how rendering service to the one harmed can help heal the wounds caused to them. I felt the movie was very open, honest, uplifting and positive.",1336262400,,319,4.517241379310345

4520014,3,B00518JDWW,"This movie was not what I expected.  Using the title ""Another Earth"" and through the previews, I thought its focus was going to be on the potential life on another planet.  It didn't really have anything to do with that.  That was simply the side back story going on behind the actual movie.  This movie is about a teenage girl who parties too hard and drives home intoxicated.  During this drive she's not paying attention at anything but the visible 2nd Earth in the night sky.  Because of this she collides with a car at a stoplight.  A husband and wife are driving home with their young son in the back seat.  The wife and child are killed.  The husband ends up in a coma and the teenager has to go to jail.  After a few years she's let out.  She's never quite the same.  She's aware what she did and didn't mean to, but has to live with that now.  Through research she discovers that the husband has come out of his coma and is alive.  She sets out to meet him and wants to make amends.  When she shows up at his door she gets cold feet and pretends she's offering housecleaning services instead.  This sets off the story of her relationship with this man that begins to grow more intimate.  She knows who he really is and he has no idea that she was responsible for his wife and kids death.  That's about all I'm going to say about it so as not to spoil it for those who still want to see it.  You get the gist of what it's about.  And ""another Earth"", um it makes a couple brief appearances in dialog, but unsure as to why it's called this since its more about these two people.  The other earth does play a small fraction of a part, but not a great enough one for me to fall in love with this.  I thought this was okay, but nothing special.",1335312000,,1748,4.155223880597015
4520015,3,B00518JDWW,"What derails to some extent Another Earth is that the movie sets up questions on multiple layers but fails to deliver real answers. The premise has lots of promise and potential, but the film does not capitalize on many of these. Instead it pokes around emotional themes, chiefly guilt, remorse, loss, sadness, and wonder, stirs these up, but never quite lets them settle again.

Brit Marling and William Mapother inhabit their roles fully, both delivering nuanced performances, but they are overshadowed by the twin Earth and its moon looming larger and larger as the movie progresses is the movie's core. The movie never explains what this twin earth is doing there, what will happen when it, as it seem, inevitably smashes into the first earth, or why this second earth has no effect on our earth's gravity, tides, climate, communications, and, most baffling, day-to-day behaviors.

The few supporting characters seem utterly unmoved by this looming planetary doppelg&auml;nger. Is it even real? Is there some allegorical message here or is the director winking at us? When we finally get some theories from the one scientist given screen time, his take is all babble. Yes, the final scene hints at various outcomes and probabilities, but it is not enough to redeem this movie from its own overbearing smugness.",1335312000,2,1314,5.078703703703703

4520018,5,B00518JDWW,"Watching Lars Von Trier's Melancholia, about an approaching planet led me to this movie made around the same time.

As Another Earth begins, we are introduced to a bright, attractive young girl with a brilliant future, with an interest in the Cosmos, and she has just got into MIT.

When another earth with the same continents and oceans appears in the sky, people get excited, some are nervous. As she drives along that night, a radio announcer talks excitedly about the new planet, while a father, pregnant mother, and five year old child sit talking in a parked car. Momentarily, she looks skyward. You can probably imagine what happens.

Now we have a woman whose life is but a walking shadow. After some time she returns to the world. But her star has somewhat diminished. Although she says little me may infer that she has unresolved grief and guilt which cripples her from moving forward in life. She takes a job that requires little human contact, as a cleaner.

Returning to the scene, she discovers the husband, and contrives to meet him and seek forgiveness.

Discoveries about the other earth may make you wonder if there are people like you on this other earth, mirrors to ourselves, mirroring our events or not. Such possibilities offer the hope of redemption, although others find it frightening.

As the husband continues to contend with his waterlogged grief, his withdrawal, and limitations of his previous musical abilities, we see no way for her to broach this subject. Meanwhile, a Branson like entrepeneur offers a select few a free trip to the other earth.

My favorite scene in the movie is when she tells the husband the story of the first cosmonaut, a healing metaphor, and so perhaps if she cannot reveal herself she may be able to heal him in other ways. I watched this scene over and over. We wonder how it will all turn out.

I found this movie to be very beautiful. It has won several awards, including two Sundance Awards, the Special Jury Prize, and an acting award for Brit Marling, a young actress who struggled to obtain acting jobs in Hollywood, and had the novel idea of writing a movie for herself with cowriter and director Michael Hall.

In doing so, they have crafted a wonderful movie. As an actress she delivers a very subtle and nuanced performance. In three scenes in a row near the begininning she says very little, but she conveys a tremendous amount without words, and she has a certain beauty, let's face it, that, if you're like me, grows on you as you watch the movie. Another earth looks like an expensive movie, yet was made on a shoestring, causing director and actress to be very resourceful. To obtain a shot of her walking out of a prison, she walked in pretending to be a yoga instructor, there to give a class to inmates. When she walked out he got the shot.

I was hugely impressed with this movie, the acting, writing, directing, the visual effects of the other planet. William Mapother, who you may remember as Ethan from Lost, or the villain from In the Bedroom plays the husband. Certainly, I liked this movie much better than Melancholia.

Now, I would watch any movie featuring Brit Marling or made by Michael Hall. I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",1332288000,4,3237,4.651488616462347
4520019,2,B00518JDWW,"To call ""Another Earth"" a science fantasy is misleading. Like ""Melancholia"" and ""Gattaca,"" its sci-fi story serves as basis for drama about humans. This is exactly where ""Another Earth"" disappoints because, in spite of the nice idea of ""another earth,"" the film's story about the two characters traumatized by the tragic events in the past is formulaic and unconvincing.

In ""Another Earth"" Brit Marling plays a young woman Rhoda Williams. Having caused a terrible car accident because of her reckless and drunken driving, she spends about four years in jail. After she comes out of prison, she visits John Burroughs (William Mapother), a former Yale professor, who lost his wife and child in the accident Rhoda caused. She wants to apologize to him, but cannot bring herself to confess the truth.

In the meanwhile, the world has been excited about the advent of a planet (called Earth 2) that looks exactly like the one we live on. The first contact through radio was established, and it is strongly suggested that on the blue plant, or ""another earth,"" another ""we"" are living.

This poses an intriguing question: suppose Earth 2 is the projection of Earth 1 (or vice versa), what is the life of ""me"" on another planet would be like? Or, in Rhoda's case, did another Rhoda commit the same mistake and regret it? Or is she having a different life that Rhoda on Planet 1 might wishes for?

Instead of developing the unique concept, however, director Mike Cahill (his feature debut) goes on telling the rather familiar story of Rhoda who gets involved (romantically) with John. John does not know anything about the one who killed his wife and child (which I think is more implausible than the existence of Earth 2). Rhoda, while being attracted to the person whose life she had ruined, thinks of traveling to Planet 2.

We are told about these things, which could have been more convincing with less sluggish storytelling and more details about these characters. I like the concept of another earth, but to make it really effective it needs a better script than this.",1332201600,3,2068,4.847025495750708
4520020,2,B00518JDWW,"This movie only runs an hour and a half, but the dragging pace of the plot makes it feel like a minor eternity.  The characters aren't unsympathetic, but everything creeps along at such a low-key, glacial rate that by the time the story came to a merciful conclusion, I found it hard to muster much feeling for them one way or another.  The basic concept could have been interesting (""what *would* you say if you met yourself?""), if the story had been constructed so as to keep the viewer's attention, but it just wasn't happening.  There's a bit of tension leading up to the inevitable exposure of the ""great deception,"" and there's a very cool scene with a saw - but that's about the best I can say for it.

Wish there had been more focus on the newly-discovered planet and perhaps getting a trip to ""Earth 2"" underway during the movie itself, rather than just having it be a background for the rest of the ""action"" (I use the term loosely), because that might have saved this movie and given it the electricity it needed to really showcase its theme.  I'm not bothered by the questionable realism of having a precisely parallel world existing in the solar system that had never been detected before (though it would have been fun to explore that issue in much more detail) - I am a sci-fi fan, so I can forgive a lot of questionable realism as long as the rest of the story keeps me engaged.  In this case, you will waste an hour and a half of your life on this film, and my advice is to watch something else, or read a good book.",1332028800,2,1533,4.36140350877193
4520021,1,B00518JDWW,"If you want 90 minutes of watching a supposedly ""brilliant"" young woman wallow in self-pity, with virtually no true character development at all, then this film is for you.  Characters are supposed to grow and develop, yet this protagonist is about as flat as any I've ever seen--I've seen much better character development in Looney Tunes cartoons.  The thinnest of plots holds things together just barely, and the ""other earth"" idea is more of a plot device than an integral part of the plot; it's like bait and switch advertising--simply a pretext to get you to watch, then they never deliver on the goods.

There are some interesting ideas in the film, but the script and direction both are among the poorest I've ever seen in a movie.  We were ready to give up after 30 minutes, when we both said ""This is really tedious,"" but we decided to hang on to see if it got better.  It didn't.  For some reason, the filmmakers thought that constantly lingering on the main character, holding shots long after their effectiveness died, was an effective method of storytelling.  It isn't.  And the lack of dialogue is terrible--Rhoda doesn't say anything to anyone (except for what's-his-name) except for a word or two.  And sleeping with him before telling him who she is?  Completely contrived and very silly.  It all leads only to one of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen, with no conflict resolution at all, just a hackneyed appearance of a new character.  If she's at all as boring and annoying as the Rhoda we've seen in this film, then it's a good thing the movie ends when it does.

4520024,4,B00518JDWW,"That's a question this movie never answers. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was intrigued. It looked like a remake of a movie from the 1960s called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journey-to-the-Far-Side-of-the-Sun/dp/B0016B6ZJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journey to the Far Side of the Sun</a>. So naturally I wanted to see it immediately. After seeing this movie, however, I doubt the two movies have much in common. I'm not sure since I still have not managed to get a copy of Journey to the Far Side of the Sun. It's been on my Wish List for a while. But as far as I know, they actually travel to the other Earth in that movie. In Another Earth, they do not. That was a big disappointment, as I was expecting them to.

So... I was expecting to get a science fiction movie and really only got a drama. I wasn't even sure why they needed ""Earth 2"" to make this movie. I think it was really only necessary so they could ask all those deep questions like ""What if you could meet yourself?"" The movie was very successful in that respect: it asked a lot of questions and left the viewer to ponder them. It wasn't mere entertainment; it made you think.

I was wondering one thing... if everything is identical on each Earth, you actually CANNOT meet yourself. When you get to the other Earth, the other you will just be on your Earth, because she will have done the same thing you did. But apparently, the synchronicity of the two Earths was broken once they became aware of each other. Imagine that. I think I would like to meet myself. Would I learn something, or would it just be pointless because she'd have the same brain as I have? Well, at least we could have an interesting conversation. Unless... we just kept predicting everything the other was about to say. In which case it would be boring. Yeah, I think this movie made me think a lot!

I wish people wouldn't say things like ""This was good for an indie."" ""This was good for a low-budget film."" ""This was good for a film without CGI."" This was good period. It was good because it was based on good acting and plot. You can have all the special effects you and want the movie will flop without acting and plot.",1330473600,,2227,4.6186868686868685

How often do we say to ourselves, ""If only I had done this differently...""?  This film exquisitely pairs the pain of guilt and loss with innocence and redemption and fuses them into a single whole. It left me ponderously quiet for a long while.  This is primarily a drama, but there is just enough science fiction in the story line to keep this movie from being anything we have ever seen before.

Then, when Rhoda first sees John Burrough's at the roadside memorial, she peeks around one of the balusters of the steps where she is hiding and the dawn sun hits her face.  I was struck by the perfect and simple beauty of that shot.  From that point on, the film just became more and more beautiful, both visually and emotionally.  There were many, many scenes that I wish I could frame and hang on the wall as beautiful works of art.  You can really tell that great care was taken.

The story itself was handled very quietly and thoughtfully, focusing more on the personal aftermath of a horrific event and the emotional evolution of the two main characters affected by the event.  However, there were a few scenes when the suspense was enough that I caught myself holding my breath.

Even though the film moves at a slow, quiet pace, I was always completely engaged because of the wonderful acting of Brit Marling and William Mapother.  Never underplaying or overplaying their parts, they made me feel as though I were an invisible witness to their character's lives.  Their ability to create empathy in the viewer is very impressive.

4520032,2,B00518JDWW,"Being one of those low budget independent movies, only those who purposely seek these things out with some hatred towards Hollywood movies will brag on and on about how this is supposed to be an ingenious masterpeice. Well, the director should have taken some tips from those Hollyweed movies and given this one here a much faster pace instead of boring you to tears for the most part.

The plot is rather interesting tho, a 19 year old girl hears on the radio that a new star has just been found in the sky that may be able to support life. As she looks in the sky while driving (drunk I think) she crashes her car into a family of 3. She goes to prison for 4 years and when she is released, she seeks out the man who survived the crash, but lost his wife and young child in the process. He has no idea who she is when she knocks on his door, but instead of saying what she wanted, she tells him she is a cleaner and he hires her to clean his house. They end up falling in love but she doesn't want to proceed with the relationship because she has not told him the truth. All while this is happening, the discovery of the new star is discovered to be another Earth that they call Earth II. There is a contest online for someone to win a trip on a shuttle to go and visit the planet, and the main actresses dream is to go and explore space, or the new planet where scientists have discovered Earth II is a planet where everyone on Earth I had a double, where everything had been the exact same events on both Earths until the time of discovering each other, 4 years before hand when it was first announced.

You can probably already guess how this movie ends. It is fairly predictable. But seeing through the idea of trying to gain interest in some sort of Sci-Fi idea of two planets, it's more of a story of a woman who causes a tragic accident, meets the man she killed the wife and kid of,accidentally gets involved with him, and their sad/depressed lives change them into more happier people... and then, later, you can probably predict what happens in the end.

To me tho, the premise and story are far more interesting then actually having to sit through this. For the most part, I was bored and yawning while my girlfriend told me to shut-up and hope it gets better. It doesn't. There is no pace, it drags on, there is no fun, comedy or anything really of any entertainment value. It's also one of those movies that must not have run long enough to call it a full length one, so inserted is a bunch of useless scenes that are not needed to do anything other then make the movie seem longer. I wanted to bleach my own eyes having to sit through that useless dribble of filler. My girlfriend was loving the cheaply made CGI scenes of Earths sky showing another Earth in the sky like the moon, but I have seen it done before, and much better, and was not at all impressed by it.

I can definitely see other people enjoying this movie, for various reasons, but for people like me who like something about a movie to be memorable, or something that makes a movie burn into your mind and make you remember it, this movie just failed to leave me with anything other then feelings of being bored and wanting to reach for the skip button, fast forward, or the off switch.

So, keep in mind, this is one of those independent movies that people praise because it's not half as bad as most indie-films and it seems artsy-fartsy enough to be praised by someone who would turn their nose up at average entertainment movies because they are given more of a budget to work with then these kind of films and would rather support blah blah blah blah... you know the story, it's too boring to keep going on with.

I'd rather have read this as a book than watched it, it really did show scenes of this girl standing still for a few minutes, while you guess what is going through her head, she may as well have had a voice over saying things like ""I saw the dust on the bench projecting a light yellow as the setting sun dripped through the old stain glass windows that didn't look like they had been washed since Bill Clinton last slept with his wife and didn't think of some other, more youthful, woman's melons that had no wrinkles or a stench of Rosie O'Donnell's breath attached to them"".

Also, if you are expecting this to be a sci-fi movie, guess again. It's a drama, the Earth II thing could easily be taken out and this would still be the same story, just with an alternate ending, possibly a thriller, which would have been more entertaining if you ask me.

See it if it interests you, but I really wouldn't expect too much from it if you think it's going to be absolutely brilliant.",1329177600,2,4680,4.304199772985244
4520033,4,B00518JDWW,"What a nice surprise.  This little indi-film comes from director and co-writer Mike Cahill and his friend Brit Marling who also stars and co-wrote the script.  Ms. Marling is an up-and-comer to keep an eye on.  She plays Rhoda Williams, a brilliant high school student who is celebrating her admission to M.I.T with friends at a party.  On her way home she is distracted by the news of a new planet coming into view that is a carbon copy of Earth.  She sees the blue planet and can't take her eyes off it.  As a result she plows into a car carrying a university music professor, his pregnant wife and their young son.  The woman and boy are killed.  Young Rhoda (Marling) is sent to prison for 4 years.  I assume alcohol is involved in her prosecution.

We pick up the story upon her release.  Still devastated by what happened to the family and her own lost future, she takes a job as a janitor in the local high school.  She also pledges herself to apologizing to the surviving father.  At the same time she enters a writing contest to win a trip to the new planet now called Earth 2. The planet is found to be a duplicate of Earth including copies of each person.  She sees this as a new chance at life.

When she goes to John Burroughs' unkempt house, she chickens out on the apology but offers to clean his home as a ""one-time"" offer from a fictitious cleaning service she represents.  John is a mess.  He's not eating right, drinks a lot and is basically still in a deep state of depression.  Feeling guilty, she offers to return on a weekly basis, but this time gets paid $70.  She never cashes the checks however.  John doesn't recognize her because being a minor at the time her name and other personal information is not known.  Frankly this is part of the story that doesn't make much sense.  Would he not know her?

In any case, John begins to regain his life and Rhoda begins to have feelings beyond just guilt.  While I don't think they are in love, they do get intimate and are moving in that direction.  When Rhoda actually wins the contest and the trip to Earth 2, John doesn't want her to leave.  She then must tell him the truth.  This doesn't go well as you would expect.  In the end, Rhoda has a better idea that seems honest if not in her best interests.  A little surprise in the last scene leaves the film open for continued discussion.  This film is really well done.  It isn't perfect but I was taken with the story and especially by Brit Marling.

This is a Blu ray transfer which looks great.  There are some very interesting shots using defuse lighting on the interiors and a wonderful look of a New England winter.  The DTS-HD sound is distributed well but this isn't a traditional sci-fi drama so the surrounds are mostly used for the soundtrack.",1328572800,,2777,4.390962671905697
4520034,4,B00518JDWW,"This movie leaves multiple impressions - the first of which is that the actual situation, the second Earth, lacks utterly in plausibility. So do fairy tales, but I enjoy them anyway.

Another part of the mix comes from the creepier side of stalking, driven by a muddled emotional mix fueled by some need so deep within her that Rhoda has no hope of identifying it, and no real urge to. In other words, an emotional mish-mosh that pretty much anyone can recognize, if they've ever looked within themselves at any length.

The visual layer, though, conveys a quite beauty. Rhoda herself could be very beautiful, if she weren't so desperate not to be. The other Earth has an unearthly beauty, one informed by decades of images from space. It also has a presence that keeps intruding quietly, at every turn. I've gotten a similar feeling near Seattle, where Mt. Rainier seems to loom around every corner.

Then, the ending raises more questions than it answers. Years of personal history led up to the period of this movie, and lifetimes continue after this interlude ends - as is true in life, too. ""Another Earth"" defies easy description, but don't most things worth any attention?

She looks up at the night sky to try to spot it.  She does, but then tragedy strikes in the form of an accident.

This accident changes the lives of many people.  This young woman later decides to find the survivor whose life was impacted most by the accident she caused, but she loses courage and instead finds herself possibly making a difference in another way.

This movie has all of the earmarks of an independent film.  It was filmed obviously on a small budget, and the actual filming has an edginess to it that adds to this increasingly tense film.  The acting is commendable, and the story line is engaging.

The initial impression is that this is going to be a heavy-duty sci-fi movie about going to another world, but the real thing could not be farther from the truth.  This film is about hope, pain, hurt, recovery, and, if possible...restitution.  It is also about what you might say to yourself if you could have a conversation with ""you"".  Of course, we do this all of the time, but it is an interesting premise.

The synopsis and tons of reviews tell what the story is about so I won't say much about that except from my perspective.

The main character, a college age young woman, has in her carelessness affected the lives of a small family. She causes a tragic accident and the subsequent grief has hollowed out both her life and the life of the husband in the small family. She so wants to be forgiven but can't begin to forgive herself; she sort of haunts the periphery of the man's life until she unexpectedly becomes drawn in. That's the gist, which in and of itself is so well done that you really feel inside the head and heart of the young woman.

The filming of this movie is for me, what really makes it work. It seems as if it was shot with one small hand camera which makes it feel like I am almost a ghost, traveling along with the young woman as she struggles along. It bonds you in a way to her character.

What is notable is that part of the story is that another planet Earth has been found and of course within the movie there is intrigue and a push to explore this new Earth as part of the background; while watching though I hardly remembered that they are actually talking about sending the young woman to the new earth. You'd think the sci-fi end of things would be a bigger blip on the radar but it's actually smaller things like a gesture in a friend's hand that she makes, it's those smaller things that grab the heart and draw me in. Hard to explain that part, but hopefully you get the idea.

BTW; this is only my second movie review. I'm not really sure what folks are looking for in a good review since liking a movie or not is a very personal thing.

Rating: 1.5

For all those sci-fi aficionados out there, I don't want to disappoint you but be forewarned that 'Another Earth' might fail to meet your expectations. The sad fact is that the film's intriguing premise of a mirror image earth appearing in the night's sky, has little to do with the science fiction flicks you've come to enjoy but much more similar to today's indies, with all the attendant melodrama and angst-ridden character machinations.

The 'parallel' Earth (herein referred to as Earth2) is not a parallel universe but actually a duplicate of our own Earth. All the people are the same as the people on Earth1 but can change in subtle ways, if they become aware of each other's existence (you can confirm this on Wikipedia but even they don't provide an explanation for this odd turn of events).

The plot is rather simple: Rhoda Williams is an outgoing high school student, about ready to go off to MIT, when she has one too many drinks and gets into a car accident where a man's wife and child are killed. The man is John Burroughs who ends up in a coma for a few years, while Rhoda is shipped off to jail for vehicular manslaughter. Because she's a juvenile at the time of the offense, her record is sealed, and the media is kept in the dark as to her identity. A big problem is that Brit Marling who plays Rhoda, was around 27 when the film was made, so it's very hard to buy that she's a juvenile (someone under 16). In NY State, the criminal records of 'youthful offenders', kids between the ages of 16 and 19, are sealed, but if they're tried as adults, their identities are not necessarily kept secret from the media.

Equally unlikely is that John has no interest in learning the identity of the youth responsible for the deaths of his wife and child. His specious explanation is that if someone was to reveal this information to him, he might not be able to control his anger and end up going berserk, perhaps attacking the offender with deadly force. Equally implausible is John's too easy acceptance of Rhoda, who poses as a trainee for a cleaning service and offers a free cleaning job when she attempts to gain entry to his home, seeking an audience with him. When was the last time someone came by and offered to clean your home for free?

Perhaps the most implausible conceit of 'Another World', is Rhoda's decision to bed John, BEFORE confessing that she was responsible for the accident. Why would Rhoda, who already feels terrible about what happened, make things worse by deceiving John and going to bed with him? Or for that matter, how many people who committed such a crime, would attempt to form a relationship with a victim, without telling them first? In most cases, a young woman who comes from a loving family (and her parents seemed like decent folks), would have sought out some kind of counsel from her parents. The film's scenarists of course imply that the accident was so devastating to her psyche, that she withdrew to the point where she didn't want anyone's help. So it's even more unlikely that a young woman, with such a fractured psyche, would have dared to solve the problem all on her own by contacting John.

Even more egregious than the overall implausibility of the plot are the shallow characterizations. We learn next to nothing about John, who is only seen interacting with Rhoda. Perhaps if we saw him interacting with another character or two, his personality might have seemed a tad bit more interesting. Rhoda is equally dull as she's as angst-ridden as John--yes, we understand that she can't get over the accident, but does such a character really make for good drama?

Yes there are people out there who will find contentment in a one-note melodrama, leading up to a protagonist's redemption. Finally, Earth2 is worked into the plot. Rhoda gives up the seat on the spaceship that's she won in an internet contest, to John, so he can see his family on Earth2. Problem is that John2 might interfere with his plans to form a new life up there. A myriad of tortured explanations are provided by a bevy of internet posters, arguing that the mere sight of his wife and child on Earth2 will soothe his troubled soul. How pathetic! As for Rhoda, contentment comes to her existence when Rhoda2 appears on Earth1, thus confirming that the accident wasn't duplicated in the mirror world. Though she never met her 'twin' and has no real bond with her, the mere 'thought' that her double has avoided the fate she experienced, is enough to dispel all those dark thoughts that has paralyzed her soul.

Kudos to Writer/Director/Cameraman Cahill for putting this whole thing together for about $80,000. Next time, however, it would be wise for Mr. Cahill to nix the shaky camera work. This could have ended up as an intriguing Twilight Zone-like episode. Unfortunately, the 'dessert' is pure indie, angst-ridden cinema, with characters as implausible as 'another earth', up in the sky.",1327190400,9,4985,4.70756880733945

A brilliant student of science, her MIT acceptance when she was 17 has been long over since the car crash, her only means of income working as part of the janitorial staff at a high school. The night of the accident, it was announced that another earth-like planet had been discovered, its location very close to our own, so close that it can be seen clear as day in the sky complete with its own moon. During incarceration, it's been studied though no attempts at contact have been made due to a lack of signals and interference. Once contact is made, however, a startling possibility is revealed, as this earth like planet is more than that, it may be a carbon copy of ours. A contest to win a trip to this new earth is being held, and Rhoda enters with a thought provoking essay about her experience. At the same time, she's trying to come to terms with her fatal mistake from years before, including attempting to apologize to the man whose wife and child died as a result. She can't bring herself to do so, and a spur of the moment little white lie grows into an even bigger one until the breaking point is reached.

Another Earth is beautifully filmed, paced, and one of the most well acted movies I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. The budget was not huge and yet so much was done with so little, it's a wonderful accomplishment. The ending is spectacular, as the choice Rhoda makes leads to a personal consequence that one doesn't ponder due to being so engrossed in the story in front of us.

4520050,2,B00518JDWW,"*** May contain a spoiler-ette or two ***

I'm sure I'll be thought of as one of those overly ""left brainers,"" but here goes. This movie is over the top in its lack of any kind of reason going into the story about impending contact with another planet. Another earth (mirror image) is really pushing it, but that's ok, I just tried to treat that like something from ""The Twilight Zone."" But a planet that looks a lot larger than the moon in the (real, i.e. first) earth's sky? It would have to be really close, and I guess in some kind of shared orbit with the earth or moon. Forget about gravity, and beyond that, forget about critical thinking!

Harry Potter is set against a backdrop of fantasy and magic, ghost movies presume the supernatural, and Star Trek explains away a lot with warp speed. But another Earth just hanging in the sky, in what otherwise would be a realistic scenario, with no attempt at a plausible explanation? Very annoying, at least I thought. On a positive note, the other Earth really does look cool!

One reviewer wrote that the film would have been better without the other Earth at all. Yes, I would have liked to see it eliminated too. But it, or something, was needed to provide a gateway to an alternate reality. The movie just needed a mechanism that would work better.

On another note, the progression of the relationship into what happens between the main characters (won't spoil here) kinda rubbed me the wrong way under the circumstances, but my reaction could be the result of good filmmaking? Just because I didn't like it, doesn't mean it's bad or wrong, though I kinda thought it was anyway.

Finally, the actors who portrayed the two main characters were both superb. And I liked that the female was young and pretty without all the tweezed brows, over-done highlights, etc. for such a character. (The chipped tooth was a nice touch, too, don't know if real or good movie make-up). Movie was well-shot, had effective and interesting interiors/exteriors, and nice camera work.

I almost turned off the movie early in watching, because of its ridiculous premise about the other Earth, but I didn't. So that does, I tell myself,  say something positive about the filmmaking.",1326758400,3,2216,4.710594315245478

4520055,4,B00518JDWW,"The history books claim that at one time popular belief was the world was flat.  It was believed that if explorers found themselves reaching to the edge of our known planet, they would simply fall off into nothingness.  Through trial and error, science, and reality, we know that not to be true.  History also stated that popular belief was that the Earth was the center of the universe; that all planets (and suns) rotated around us.  Again, through science, astrology, and exploration, we know that not to be true.  Another Earth, this year's low-fi sci-fi mumblecore film, takes these known truths and seems to spin them into a world of doubt and question.  What if another planet showed up next to us?  What if that planet showed signs of life?  What if that planet looked just like Earth?  Finally, what if was inhabited by us?  These are the tough philosophical and personal questions posed in nearly the middle of this film, and surprisingly Another Earth rarely bothers to answer them.  Instead, director (and co-writer) Mike Cahill turns the story inward and shows us that despite popular belief, we are not the center of our own universes.

Like what Primer did for time-travel or what Cold Weather did to the mystery genre, Another Earth attempts to do with the philosophies of space.  There is no question, this is a science fiction film, but it does not follow the Hollywood standard.  This is an emotional film that uses the fear of the unknown (aka the darkness of destiny) and turns it toward us, the viewers, and also into our neo-hero Rhoda Williams.  It becomes a story about having the world tightly wound within your hands, but within a split second, everything can change.  Williams was just accepted into M.I.T. the night Earth 2 arrived.  The surprise of another planet coupled with a few drinks brought her world crashing down when she slammed into John Burroughs' car, instantly killing his pregnant wife and child.  Four years later, she is released from prison to return home; directionless, full of shame, and wanting to apologize, she arrives at the doorstep of Burroughs' home under the ruse of a housekeeper.  Since the accident occurred when she was a minor, her personal information was sealed, and thus the two are complete strangers with a history.  As time develops, and broken as they are, Burroughs and Williams begin to heal together, individually working through the tragedy that destroyed their known worlds.  Meanwhile, Earth 2 gets closer and closer, and the secret it holds becomes a startling reality.

Director Cahill has crafted a low-budget film that picks at your mind and personal beliefs.  It rigidly paints two flawed characters trying to stand despite the weight of this world on their shoulders.  Another Earth is a film about choices, about the subsequent outcomes of those actions, and the stemmed belief that if you didn't look up at Earth 2 that eventful night, would life have taken a different course?  From the beginning you realize this is not going to be an easy film to watch.  With dark lighting, an abundant use of greys and blacks, the ever-popular shaky camera to build tension and lengthy scenes of staring into the void of the other planet, Another Earth grabs first and barely gives you time to question.

The tense chemistry between Marling and Mapother adds another dynamic layer to this film and continues to blur that line between drama and science fiction.  The turmoil is so deep, so devastating between our two central characters that the only plausible escape comes in the form of a raffled trip to the water-based planet.  When the trip offers more than just sights, but philosophical interaction with yourself, Another Earth hits a new note all together.  It becomes a thinking film.  To me, this is where Cahill begins to shine, and Marling's script becomes genuine.  The interjection of Purdeep into Williams' world shows that accepting your choices and actions can be a viable solution to life.  His screen time and interaction in this film is so small, yet his message is the crux of what Another Earth is trying to tell us.  A single word written on the hand of a self-inflicted blind/deaf man spells the surrounding truth to Another Earth.

The ending, without being a strain, is a bit on the clich side, but it is what the moment represents that will pull at your mind muscles.  Is Earth 2 truly identical?  Another Earth is a strong entry into the minimalist sci-fi cinema realm, and I am excited to grow with the work of Marling both behind the screen with her writing as well as what she can accomplish as an actor.  Despite a small gripe of the Earth 2 image hanging in the sky too much (I knew it was there - did I constantly need to be reminded?), I feel this film opens the doors to great discussions as well as detailed ""new"" theories.  For this critic, that is how films are evolving today - not only was Another Earth entertaining to view, but is it something that you could discuss with friends afterwards.  A film fails if you walk away with nothing to say.  My question to anyone reading is:  Was there really an Earth 2?",1326412800,3,5123,4.748868778280543

Above all the story telling is phenomenal.

Physicists have long suggested that there maybe multiple universes; at least that's what the math is hinting us of such possibility. What happens when another universe that was created based on a decision path cracks wide open and the two universes slightly overlap? We'd see the Earth-Moon above the sky on the Earth we live on. We'd see it everywhere we go. Big circle, small circle, like cogs. We'd try to communicate with the beings on the other Earth. People on both Earths are ever so slightly different based on decisions they've made and circumstances that influenced their behavior. In some cases, like that of the woman we see on the cover, a slight change results in consequences exponentially divergent from what might have been, and is.",1326153600,2,904,4.751592356687898
4520057,2,B00518JDWW,"This movie drew me in with its title. I remember seeing a trailer in the theater too that seemed to play up the other Earth aspect. It's barely a part of the movie and has little purpose. If you took Earth-2 out of this movie, you wouldn't really miss it. At it's heart this movie is an artsy independent film about sad people being sad. Lead character Rhoda feels bad that she drove drunk and killed some man's wife and child. I already forget his name and I just watched it a few hours ago. He's the stereotypical mess living in his filth wasting his life away in front of a Nintendo Wii and drinking too much. There's nothing new here. Students of psychology and sociology may debate over the nature, motivations, and feasibility of Rhoda's romantic relationship. It seemed cliche and a step too far for reality to me.

Needless to say this is not a science fiction movie really, so if you are considering watching it in hopes that it may be, you've been warned. It's in there to a limited extent but it's just scenery. We never know why it's there, where it came from, why it keeps getting closer, what happens when the people of the two worlds interact face-to-face. We don't see the space voyage, which is one of the running plot lines. Imagine watching Contact without any actual contact. It's anti-climactic. And no one ever questions the increasingly close proximity of the two Earths. They seem destined for collision, but there's no concern from anyone.

The movie drags in several places. There are passages of silence that I think were suppose to seem deep but weren't. I ended up browsing the web while pushing myself through the final 30 minutes of the movie.

There is decent acting in spite of the weak script. The scene when Earth made first contact with Earth-2 was creepy and exciting (from the perspective of a science fiction fan), but there was little follow through on what that meant on the greater scale. The final seconds of the film caught my attention and then sadly it just ended, once again failing to deliver.

I also questioned why no one cared that Rhoda gave away her trip to Earth-2. She won the contest for a reason and it wasn't to give her ticket away. If I was the person running that contest that would have been against the rules.

I gave this film two stars, because it does have a few interesting moments. Overall, however, it tries too hard to be too artsy and philosophical with a cliche emotional drama, quiet moments, and ultimately no payoff. You can see the ending of this movie approaching faster than Earth-2.",1325980800,8,2561,4.58296943231441

This was just an excellent movie.  The main character was so wonderful..  Her portrayal of someone who just gets out of prison, just by the looks on her face, was pretty amazing.  You could tell what she was thinking.  She was so amazing.

This is the story of a young woman who is involved in a tragic accident.  It happens to occur on the night the world discovered there was a duplicate Earth out there.  There is very little about the duplicate Earth part of the story, but what there was was ingenious.

Has a cool ending also!  Do see it.  I have a list of about 20 films that are my all time favorites, and this is one of them.  The movie may not get an Oscar, but the young actress might.

4520059,5,B00518JDWW,"This is one of my favorite scifi movies I've seen in the last year. It seems to have been filmed with very limited means but the writers and director seemed to have used that to their advantage and made a unique film that expressed all they wanted to without using the common methods using standard techniques requiring a large budget (special effects, props, exotic, location, etc). The end product has a unique and poetic feel which takes considerable skill to pull off and the film makers deserves credit for that.

Its theme is the discovery of a twin earth that is almost a mirror reflection of Earth. The paths of the two twin planets soon begin to diverge upon the mutual discoveries of each other. The film makers use the concept of a twin earth as a vehicle to explore issues of existential crisis, forgiveness, tragedy, human relationships, regret, the random contingency life's course and a host of other important issues all skillfully weaved together in a memorable film. I also thought the lead actress (also one of the writers) Brit Marling and the lead actor did a good job of acting. Explaining the plot will not do it justice because it ends up sounding contrived and a mishmash or it may sound boring to some people. But if you're into thoughtful movies exploring deeper subjects than the usual sci-fi fair and appreciate well-crafted scenes that are both complex and flows with ease, I think you'll enjoy this movie.",1325808000,,1436,4.767068273092369
4520060,5,B00518JDWW,"I enjoyed this movie immensely!  It's one of the most original, thought-provoking, non-HollyWood stories I've seen in a long time.

If you're expecting typical Science Fiction fare, with the typical Michael Bay treatment - this is NOT the movie for you.  If you enjoy a great story, that requires the ability to read subtext, then you will enjoy this a lot.",1325721600,3,357,4.819672131147541
4520061,4,B00518JDWW,"Another Earth received little attention in the theatres outside of most newspaper movie critics giving it decent reviews. It is a lower budget non- Hollywood film, and that probably effected marketing. Hopefully in the afterlife of theatres it gets it's proper praise. Rhoda, played astonishingly fresh by Brit Marling is a young woman who's brush with fate opens the doors of science fiction. On the night of her life changing fatal car accident science discovers a new planet in reachable distance to us.

As the film evolves this planet is revealed to be another Earth through some of the most gripping and realistic scenes a sci-fi buff could dream up. All the issues of a paralellel Earth are subtly and not so subtly addressed in unique and awe inspiring ways. This is not a film for action junkies or those waiting for space monsters to pounce. It is the collision of old school science fiction with the everyday existence feel of a tragic drama.

The complexities of another Earth are interesting to ponder, especially as we see it looming in the sky above the players. The other Earth is referred to, by us, as ""Earth 2"" which rightly prompts Rhoda's ""boss"" (played competently by William Mapother)to quip angrily, ""Do you think THEY are calling US Earth 2?"" Be warned that this movie was shot with a digital camera (very professionally) and can have a ""direct to video"" look, minus the routine story line.

Another Earth is a rarity. It is (to my knowledge)one of the first films directed by newcomer Mike Cahill, who I think many will want to see more of. Every adjective associated with the words creative and fresh can easily be applied to this monumental film. Love and redemption become entangled as some of the best science fiction to date plays out. A soul piercing ending seals the deal. Definitely not a film for the artistically stunted.",1325635200,5,1857,4.796875

The silence isn't filled with stunning visual images or movement, but rather just the main character Rhoda being depressed with her lot in life. Unlike say 2001: Space Odyssey, where the silence has meaning, here in this movie it's simply boring.

The whole concept of the second Earth is supposed to be a philosophical metaphor for the fact that small acts of luck/misfortune can dramatically alter somebody's life. However, it's a bit overdone. The whole concept of a second Earth literally just hanging out in space next to ours is way too unrealistic and unscientific to carry the film. Viewers can't take it seriously.

4520064,4,B00518JDWW,"What would you say to yourself if you discovered another you, exactly like you, living on another planet?

That was a very interesting thought experiment that the movie offers to us. It offers us a way to view ourselves more as other people might see us, and that can offer insight and surprises. Try to 'lose yourself' and think of what it would be like if you saw another person just like you. How would you describe yourself? What advice would you give yourself? What might you change for the better? What would you keep the same?

Truly an eye-opening experience and an 'extension' of the movie that makes it very worth your time if you are the type to enjoy contemplating things of this sort. The movie can serve as the 'platform' for the experiment in which you find your 'other you' and try to see yourself more objectively.

The fine details really sold the movie for me.  I would highly recommend this film for viewing and purchase.  I think William Mapother deserves an Academy Award for his perfomance.,1325289600,,338,4.661016949152542
4520066,1,B00518JDWW,"""Another Earth"" really disappointed me.  I thought it was going to focus on the ""other earth,"" but they barely touch on it.  This movie could easily have been made without the Earth 2 aspect.  In fact, it has been made hundreds of times and much better in movies such as ""Return to Me"" and books like ""Jane Eyre.""

Instead of focusing on the other Earth, we get two dull caricatures who could have come from any chick flick. There are lots of scenes of the Rhoda, the main character, staring into space with vacant eyes, haunted by her past.  The director shows the male lead in mostly dark shots when he's unhappy and bright shots when he's happy.  He spends most of his time drinking, in darkened rooms.  Some of the scenes are laughable they are so cliche.

I suppose this would have been a 2 star movie for me, if I hadn't felt misled by the preview.  I wanted to learn a lot more about the other Earth.  I don't mind overlooking the science of these sorts of movies, but learning more about the other Earth would have been far more interesting than the two boring characters on which this movie focuses.",1325289600,17,1108,4.413793103448276

4520069,4,B00518JDWW,"This was a very good film that could have been an outstanding film if the ending had been done better.  I won't give away any explicit secrets, so let me talk around it a little.

Some stories set you up, and then leave you hanging at the end in such a way that there are multiple, interesting ways you could interpret the ending.  They don't give you a specific ending because it is more fulfilling for the viewer to work out on their own what they think was the most likely meaning, if any.  Usually, there is some very dramatic twist associated with this kind of ending that tries to catch the viewer off guard, forcing them to further contemplate ""what does it all mean?""  That appears to be what the writers of the screen play were shooting for with this one, but in fact what they ended up with for a ""twist"" was not at all unexpected.  In fact, given other scenes in the movie, it would have been rather a glaring omission if the ""twist"" event of the final scene hadn't taken place.  In that sense, it was really something you expected, and when it happens you're thinking to yourself, ""Okay, here it comes...""  But there's nothing more except the rolling of the credits.  The ""twist"" turns out to be just the logical extension of what you already half anticipated would have to happen.  Dramatically speaking, it's a huge let down.

I compare this to a film like The Fountain, which I saw for the first time at the theatre.  When the credits began rolling, the entire packed theatre went dead silent.  No one spoke, and no one moved at all until well into the credits.  It was as if we were all stunned by the implications of what had just taken place.  I have never seen such a reaction to a film like that before nor since.  The emotional impact, and the fact that the mind was just left reeling from the implications the film raised literally took the breath away from the audience.  I'd hoped for something equally powerful from Another Earth.  The potential was certainly there, but the script writers just weren't up to the task.  The ending left behind only a sense of having failed to live up to the potential of the film.

The film is really an exploration of the idea of making choices, sometimes good, sometimes bad, and then taking responsibility for the consequences.  It's about balancing the cosmic scale where you can, because it's the right thing to do.  And it deals a little bit with the notion of being able to forgive and renew yourself, even though inside you may initially feel like you don't merit such forgiveness.  The concept of there being ""another Earth"" is really just a foil; a mirror, for exploring these ideas, and with just a very little bit of rewriting of the script, any number of other foils could have been substituted that would have told the story as it was told just as well.

It may sound as though I didn't care for the film, but I did.  It was a very good film, and the message it brings is one that, if understood and put into general practice, would make this world a much better place.  But from a strictly technical viewpoint, there are things, most particularly the ending, that could have been done differently that would have resulted in an ending that slammed home with the impact of an atomic bomb.  As it was, all you really get is a rather meager firecracker.  I'm hopeful that perhaps other endings were shot, but not used, and perhaps at some point in the future they would be included as alternate endings in the special features of the release.  I would really like to see what other possibilities the writers of this screenplay might have come up with.  It certainly wouldn't take much effort to improve on the one they chose.",1325030400,2,3695,4.496251874062969
4520070,4,B00518JDWW,"...but it was still a good movie.

The questions Another Earth asks and forces the viewer to ask oneself are intriguing. I chose this film thinking it was a Sci-Fi type of movie and was surprised to find it was more philosophical, more sophisticated, and less glitz and glamour than I thought I'd encounter.

It's not your typical Hollywood style, blow 'em up or razzle dazzle 'em movie. It's pace is slower. It's main character, Rhoda, is more complex than most standard blockbuster stars. It's plot is also deeper than most movies I've viewed recently.

If I had one complaint, and perhaps this is why it didn't do better at the 'box office', it would be how it was depicted in the trailer. The trailer had me believing this would be a 'Contact' type of film, but that was not the case. So, if it was billed as a sci-fi film and viewers went to see a sci-fi film, they were sorely disappointed. Yes, it has tinges of science fiction in it, but the main focus of this movie was not Earth Two, rather the characters on Earth One were under a microscope, living their lives for the viewer to observe. Had this been portrayed as a philosophical movie it may not have startled me so much when the actual plot evolved. It was a good plot. But it is not a sci-fi movie about another Earth. It's a movie about choices we make, how they affect our lives, and what we do with those choices. Another Earth, and the fact that they find this planet, is merely another twist in the characters' lives that they must deal with...and ask themselves...what should they do and thus we the viewers find ourselves asking...what would we do.",1325030400,,1621,4.488135593220339

This movie has one of those other dimensions becomes viable to our Earth, another Earth where someone didn't get drunk and  kill someone. I think it shows raw emotions in a real world without special effects and non stop action.  More like a play.
The movie was made on an extremely limited budget with no special effects and I think if you allow yourself to just flow with the movie, you'll find this to be an entertaining and thought provoking movie. It's unlike most movies you'll see.

4520075,5,B00518JDWW,"""Another Earth"" is not at all what it seems.  I was expecting a science fiction story of one kind of another.  Not at all.  This is a story about a woman who commits an inexcusable, if understandable, mistake which ruins and ends several lives.  Rhoda Williams is celebrating, with a few glasses of champagne, her acceptance to MIT and a future in astrophysics.  Distracted by the discovery and visibility of a new planet in the solar system, driving home she is the cause of a terrible traffic accident which kills the family of a famous musician.  Her life as she knew it is over, and his, of course, is destroyed.  More would be telling, (other reviews here go through the whole story, but I shall not) but this story is about the futility of anger, the power of forgiveness, and of course the precious nature of life and the importance of being willing to start over again.  I was at first disappointed in this film, having expected a science fiction flick, but slowly it captured me until I realized that I was in the grip of an unusually powerful and unforgettable story about redemption.

This was a low budget film along the lines of ""Blair Witch"" and similar genre.  No matter.  No flashy special effects detract from the inexorable storyline of this superb film.  Impossibly beautiful Brit Marling successfully carries off the role of a down-and-out woman who has ruined her life and those of others and knows it.

You never know which way it's going to go--my big question throughout most of the movie was, ""Will she tell him or won't she?""  She must, but she will certainly destroy him if she does.  And the inclusion of the blind and deaf janitor -- a story line that seems to have nothing to do with the main story, but in a very satisfying way, adds to the depth of the movie.

This and the hundreds of other scientific issues were not addressed, much to my disgust.

Most importantly, it was impossible to connect with either of the main characters, so what could have been an interesting exploration into how they understand and forgive each other becomes a snoozy stare-fest that competes with Drive for 2011's Most Overuse of Staring Award. Did I mention the slow points?

There's also a very two-dimensional aspect to the entire setup which may be due to the lack of supporting characters in the film. It's hard to imagine the man as a father because we never get to know what he's like in that role. It's hard to see Brit as an inspired, intelligent student whose life is ruined by drinking and driving (don't do it, kids) because it's all rushed through with exposition. So in the end, it seems more like a play with two people with no real depth or engagement.

 It was, by far, one of the most ethereal and captivating motion pictures I've seen recently.

I like how, while a sci-fi movie, and a rather inaccurate one at that, the ""science"" of it was more of the undertone of the story.

4520081,4,B00518JDWW,"I heard mixed things about Another Earth, mostly what I heard was that it was highly over-rated. As I was still highly intruded about the film I blind bought it on Blu-ray. I went in thinking I would probably be semi-entertained for 93 minutes, however I got much more out of it than I expected.

The style of the film is what got me. Yes it is a very independent film, yet it has something to offer which not many big Hollywood blockbuster movies have. It is a smart movie which is heavy on drama and a bit lighter on sci-fi. There are many very cool shots of Rhoda (Brit Marling), the main character walking with Earth 2 in the background. As a sci-fi fan, and an indie drama fan, I greatly enjoyed all aspects of this film. Techno music would usually not seem a great choice for a drama, however it fits in well and builds your anticipation.

The thing that really got me was the 89 minutes of great character development and the last 4 minutes of twists in the story line. I sort of knew where the movie was going, however I cannot get the ending out of my mind. It greatly reflects back on the entire film and a viewer who watched and listened to the film will greatly enjoy and appreciate the powerful ending.

The cast was perfect. Brit Marling was fantastic and William Mapother also did a great job, but they both really shine together. They each have their own individual depressions and darkness, however together they either share it or express it in different ways. This film was great and while Melancholia may be a little deeper with a much bigger budget, Another Earth greatly tops Melancholia in particular aspects of the film. Both are great films, however Another Earth is much more personable and I could relate more to their characters as it was greatly more down to Earth.

The PQ & AQ of the Blu-ray are great. Most scenes are very sharp and clear. At times the audio is very hard to hear the dialog. The music and sounds are all great and very sharp, however there were times where I had to greatly increase the volume to hear what they were saying.

4520082,1,B00518JDWW,"The story had potential but whereas similar, ""What is the meaning of life?"" movies ""The Tree of Life"" and ""Le Quattro Volte"" succeeded to a large degree in presenting an engaging visual representation to that question this movie seemed scattered, disjointed, schizophrenic and even factually highly inaccurate. The potential shown in this movie question, ""What would we really like to see if we could stand outside ourselves and look at us?"" The movie's answer was shown as inappropriate sex between an older male and young vulnerable female, along with alcoholic enticement and a contest inspired free trip to another Earth. Next we'll see American consumerism at it's best with coupons and TV sing-offs for that final spot.

The vehicle of using another Earth with hypothesized identical selves not only was ridiculously portrayed as a barely visible Earth coming out of nowhere and growing as the movie progressed into a planet so large and so close that most of the physical science we have ever learned is now tossed out the window. So much for education. Meeting identical selves was just plain '50s scifi absurd. The scenes where the custodian decides, for no reason, to blind himself with bleach added nothing. The scenes where the surviving husband has no knowledge of who killed his wife and son and then blindly accepts a young girl appearing out of nowhere to clean his house for free - beyond incredulous. Acting was unemotional and bland - you end up feeling nothing for either of our main characters.

4520083,5,B00518JDWW,"I've been a diehard fan of fantasy and science fiction since my elementary school days soon after I began to amass novels and short story collections in these genres I expanded my infatuation permitting it to influence my burgeoning love of cinema.  There is nothing unusual with this progression of events; I am one on millions that have undergone a similar progression and usually I can find some basis for understand any discrepancies between the general consensus and my own dissenting opinion. Then there are the instances when I think my fellow devotees of the genre are close to being bat guano crazy. A more than suitable example of this pertains to the general critique of the independent film `Another Earth'. The negative comments are almost exclusively pertain to one on the central plot devices use in the movie, as the title suggests the movie is set where scientists have discovered a duplicate earth drawing closer to our planet. This is employed as a backdrop for a moving story about a young woman's search for redemption. Critics are quick to point out the real world physics involved with a planet of equal mass move so close to our earth that it practically fills our sky. Yes, I full agree that this scenario is completely impossible. The planets' gravity would rip each other apart long before they annihilated each other with a cataclysmic crash into each other. Certainly the atmosphere, oceans and land masses would be destroyed not to mention the complete eradication of life on both worlds. This is undisputable from any scientific perspective. While I don't dispute these facts I do find issue with a little point here. The same Sci-Fi fans have no problems with a guy pitting on a little green ring and zipping off into outer space or werewolves and vampires fighting over a teenage girl but this departure from reality appears to stoke their ire. Guys, it is a literary device called allegory which by definition is an extended, symbolic us of a metaphor. The filmmaker is not presenting something fit cinematic art that uses imagery and sub text to relate an extremely emotionally driven, humanistic story to the audience.  Please take a hint from MST3K and relax and just sit back. This is a film to be experienced not subjected to a Myth busters like rational dissection.
Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling) is an exceptional girl with her entire life stretched out in front of her. Rhonda is very pretty and intelligent far in advance of her peers. One fateful night she goes out for an unusual night of drinking with her friends. This is not something habitual for Rhonda but this was a special occasion, her acceptance to MTI. The posters on her bedroom wall belie a touch of irony considering the focus of the illogically negative comments, is into astronomy. Considering the repudiation of the school a reasonable case can be made for her wanting to study astrophysics. In uncharacteristically stupid moments even the brightest teens are prone too, Rhonda gets behind the wheel of her car to drive home. She careens into a car containing John Burroughs (William Mapother), his pregnant wife and young son. John is gravely injured falling into a coma while his family is killed. Rhonda is convicted of felony drunk driving and as the film opens is being released on parole after serving several years in prison. Just as the accident was about to occur a news item is heard on the radio concerning the discovery of s duplicate of our earth in the distance heading towards us. During the time of Rhonda's incarceration Earth 2 has moved closer to us looming large in our sky. Rhonda's demeanor has collapsed into a flattened affect. Although qualified for any job available through her parole agent Rhonda wants to work as a custodian in her former high school. The position offers exactly what she wants most; minimal human contact and mind numbing routine tasks involving cleaning. This choice in occupation will soon be reinforced as to the deeper meaning it represents helping to provide the symbolic foundation of the piece. One day while returning home from work she sees Burroughs leaving a toy at the side of the road which was the site of that life altering moment. Rhonda wants to clear her ailing conscience by apologizing to him. She goes to his run down home and sees that he is living amidst a scattering of liquor bottles and prescription medication bottles.  Before Rhonda can Leave Burroughs opens the door. Unable to confess herself to him she blurts out a story about a trial free cleaning. He accepts and invites her in to clean his home. Totally unexpected by Rhonda he accepts the faux offer and hires her. Rhonda begins to go to Burroughs' home each week to clean his place. Slowly the two open up to each other. First a tentative friendship is formed with eventually leads to a sexual relationship finally culminating with a romance. Rhonda happens to hear about a contest to win a ticket to a privately financed mission to Earth 2. She wins and when she goes to tell Burroughs informs him about her culpability in the destruction of his family. It had known for awhile that the inhabitants of the new planet contains doppelgangers our inhabitants of our world. One theory arises that the synchronicity was broken when mutual discovery was made. Rhonda hoped that John's family may still be alive there and gives him her ticket.
This film is truly a work of art. It cannot be considered as a literally story but rather must be interpreted through the prism of the images used to elaborate the themes explored. The most important has to be personal redemption. In many ways there is a mirroring in the emotional state of John and Rhonda that is visually symbolized a=by the appearance of the duplicate planet.  John not only lost his family due to the incident he could no longer peruse his successful career as a conductor, composer and professor. The loss of this career also removed the means for of expression has always provided. In a similar light Rhonda's bright future was destroyed by that single tragic bad decision. At one point the prospect of exploring a new planet first hand would have filled her with elation. But it was a desperate move to find an alternate reality. Her need to cleanse herself is manifested through her propensity for cleaning places outside her home. She needed to scrub the world around her to try to return order to his chaotic life. Besides the overt symbolism afforded by the planet hanging in our sky the filmmaker Mike Cahill employs several, subtle visual leitmotifs to establish the emotionally intense mood of the story. While her life is in a disarray of emotions Rhonda dehumanizes herself with a wool cap and unisex overalls. This not only hides her identity reinforcing herself imposed isolation but she conceals her gender denying her young womanhood. Reflecting this in his own fashion John habitually wears a watch cap masking his self expression. Once their relationship begins to blossom the cap comes off and Rhonda begins to wear dresses in cheerful patterns. One theme that is nicely visualized is the disruption of their lives into a chaos. This is wonderfully visualized by the abundance of dust particles that swarm in the air as Rhonda cleans her room and John's home. They fill the air just as this once accident obfuscated the lives of Rhonda and John. This is particularly noticeable with the high definition version of the film.
Aspects of this film reminded me of the Mumblecore movement in independent film. While it does not conform exactly to all the defining aspects of this style there is the strong sense of naturalism through use of realistic settings and props. The leading lady, Brit Marling, co wrote the film and is a director herself. This is a team consisting of relatively new filmmakers in Ms Marling and Mr. Cahill so if this represents how the start their careers I greatly anticipate watching them mature in their crafts.  The movie is touching with an economic use of dialogue. The words hold significance here but it is the emotional impact of the stunning cinematography employed here. you do not watch this film; you experience it submitting to full immersion in its beauty.

We meet Rhoda Williams a seemingly intelligent young girl who loves astrophysics and will be going to MIT. While hearing on her car radio that another planet has been spotted she looks out her window to find the blue dot. We see a man, John Burroughs, with his family stopped at I assume a traffic light with his wife and their young son in the back seat. The boy appears to be in a car seat but I cannot tell. Rhoda's car hits them head on and the movie goes forward from there. These two strangers lives become intertwined as they struggle through the events of their life after to accident.

Director/co-writer Mike Cahill (Boxers + Ballerinas) teams with producer/co-writer Brit Marling to challenge our concepts of reality and redemption with this romantic sci-fi drama about a radiant astrophysics student who endeavors to travel to Earth 2, a newly discovered mirror of our own home planet. Rhoda Williams (Marling) was driving in her car and listening to the radio when the DJ announced the discovery of Earth 2, which had just appeared from the other side of the sun. Gazing out her window at the newly discovered planet, Rhoda neglectfully careens into a minivan carrying a small family. Everyone but the father is killed instantly, and Rhoda is sentenced to four years in prison. Upon emerging, the repentant reckless driver finds herself drawn to the lone survivor. Meanwhile, Rhoda learns of an essay contest to win a seat on a civilian space shuttle to Earth 2. Perhaps, on that strangely familiar planet, an alternate version of herself exists -- one that has made different choices, and followed a different life path. The only way she will ever find out is to win the contest and secure her seat on a ride into the great unknown.

I have now read over 10 reviews on this movie and can't believe the balance of love and hate. Personally, I loved it!

The planet turns out to be a duplicate Earth and apparently we have duplicates there.  As their lives re-awaken Rhoda is granted the opportunity of a lifetime, to travel to this other Earth and visit this alternative reality.

This is not a science fiction movie but more of a redemption with a twist. The actors make this movie for me. The plot combines a very real, complex emotional ride with the underlying alternate reality taking a subplot backseat. The slow, steady, patient pace creates emotion that you couldn't get if the storyline was rushed.  My only compliant was how detached her parents were. Rhoda is not a bad girl, she is not a flighty girl, hell, she was accepted to MIT's Astrophysics Program, yet, her terrible accident is made to seem like she is irresponsible and a drunk. Was she? I don't recall her drinking but I do know she left a party and got behind the wheel. Brit Marling does a wonderful job of making you think she is in fact a 17 year old guilt ridden young woman.

It doesn't require that you carry a Mensa membership card to understand it. But, it does require - at least - the ability to appreciate dialog, expressive features, plotting, and great ideas. While it is excellent on all those points, it is the great ideas that linger after viewing Another Earth, the questions.

So, why have some viewers panned this? Sometimes you're just in the mood for entertainment, fun. Sometimes though, you're in the mood for a Citizen Kane. Certainly, Another Earth is not in the company of that great Orson Welles opus. But, it tries. It does tend more toward the art house variety of entertainment. It is obviously not the beneficiary of budgetary largess. But, it is no slouch, either. It held my interest without wavering. Darn' if I don't want to see what happens each time Rhoda knocks on John's door. Will she tell him her secret?

In addressing the desire to find some dignified purpose(and, maybe escape) after a tragic choice, Another Earth reflects on fundamental human aspirations: How do I right my wrongs and how do I face myself and my past. Sometimes, we aren't ready to ask those questions. But, in Another Earth, X and Y can't be bothered with lesser things.",1323388800,4,1425,4.602362204724409

4520091,5,B00518JDWW,"I'm a cantankerous old goat, rarely moved to hyperbole, but I was simply enthralled by this film: totally absorbed throughout, except when I found myself chuckling giddily at the realisation I was watching a profoundly brilliant piece of cinema. The last time I had that sensation was in 1991 when I saw Silence of the Lambs. Another Earth is an utterly different film, but in its own way it offers, just as completely, everything that this medium of film promises and so rarely delivers.

In Another Earth, a new planet appears, close by, in the sky. In fact, it is another Earth, identical to our own. Thereafter, Earth II precipitates, frames and propels a delicate and desolate gravitational attraction between two irreparably damaged people. Irreparably damaged because the only thing which will heal them is the only thing that cannot: each other. Another Earth explores that relationship and, with the aid of the planet-sized metaphor, the ever-present path-dependency of our short, brutish existences.

This is an independent film: budgets are tight and much is shot, Blair Witch style, on a hand-held camcorder. The blown-out exposures, over-sharpened lines and noisy, boxy sound give the picture the feel of a student project. But science fiction with production values at zero is like silent film: if forces you to watch, and undistracted by dazzling computer generated images and 7.1 digital surround sound, you are drawn fully into the ingenious screenplay and the human resonances it explores.

Rhoda Williams is about to go to college. She's smart: she'll be an MIT astrophysics undergraduate, and she's handsome: not a million miles from a young Laura Dern. You might call her pretty, but she's by no means saccharine sweet. She is, however, tipsy: intoxicated not just with the promise of the path on which her young life is taking her, but with a little too much champagne. She gets in her car to go home. Rhoda takes her eyes off the road and gazes at this new Earth.

There is, of course, a ghastly accident. It brings Rhoda together with John Burroughs, a composer and a devoted husband and father who is the only survivor when Rhoda's car ploughs into his at a pedestrian crossing. Thus are their characters brought together and simultaneously flung apart by the centripetal force of their own damaged psychologies to the most isolated, remotest reaches of human space.

When John Burroughs emerges from his coma his reaction to his family's death is, well, to burrow: he retreats to the huge, draughty and decaying New Haven house, to drink, wither and die. He compounds his downward spiral with clutter: rubbish, bottles and piles  of trash: the detritus of his life are the physical manifestations of his disintegrating psyche.

Rhoda emerges, after a similar period, from prison. Her spiral seems as destructive and hopeless as John's; she withdraws into herself and hatches various plans to escape the here-and-now altogether. Her more benign attempt is to enter an essay competition to win a seat on a probe to Earth II being organised by an Australian entrepreneur (yes, I found this odd too: perhaps this is a parallel universe where the men from down under won the space race). Rhoda also tries more damaging means of putting an end to her suffering, too.

While morosely visiting the scene of the accident Rhoda observes John Burroughs doing the same. He knows little of the details of the accident and nothing of Rhoda. She resolves at least to apologise to him, gets as far as his front door and, human frailty being what it is, fluffs her lines. Instead, she makes an excuse by dint of which she winds up in a distant, but ongoing interaction with Burroughs anyway.

Thence commences the tragic, and delicate, convergence of these lonely orbits. All the while that missing admission, like Earth II in the sky, looms ever larger.

Their burgeoning relationship, we know, is as flawed by human weakness as was the accident, and yet here are two people, with no alternative means of recovery and who offer each other great redemption, but only so long as there is this awful lie between them.

The film unfolds carefully, slowly and wondrously, without a false step throughout its length.

When I emerged from the cinema a giant gibbous moon hung low over the Soho skyline like another world, as if even the universe itself was pitching in to Cahill's metaphorical scheme. It followed me home, slinking behind the trees and between buildings, always there, watching my every step. It's still there now.

Beautiful, and profound.

It is not a science fiction film, though it does delve a little into parallel universe theory - and the idea of, what decisions in life has the other ""me"" made?  Is the other me happy, or has the other me made terrible mistakes?

I do not want to in any way give away any significant part of the characters and their specific roles as I personally believe it would take away from the emotionional experience of each individual viewer. I know this must come across sounding odd, but I sincerely believe you will find the (personal)journey it projects so worth while during its evolution that at least everyone who chooses to watch this beautiful adaptation will not regret their own personal experience. I would love to see many, many more movies of this caliber in the near future.

I still give it 5 stars after two seemingly random viewings two separate days but one year apart.  After watching the second time and just reading Olly B.'s review, with which I agree in part:

Olly writes:

""Thence commences the tragic, and delicate, convergence of these lonely orbits. All the while that missing admission, like Earth II in the sky, looms ever larger.

Their burgeoning relationship, we know, is as flawed by human weakness as was the accident, and yet here are two people, with no alternative means of recovery and who offer each other great redemption, but only so long as there is this awful lie between them.""

First, a personal observation to Olly.  Olly, you can wait a lifetime for people who have wronged you (even when you have proof) to apologize ""the admission looms,"" at least if you are only accepting words as The Apology. Sometimes actions speak many more worlds than do words.

We have an echo of ourselves from the following scenes:

1. man with tinfoil hat and sandwich sign warns that earth 1 is a holograph of earth 2
2. main character i believe tells us that earth 2 probably does not see us as earth 1
3. CETI official finds she has another self born the same date in the same place
4. We are told just before the end that ""synchronicity"" is broken the moment earth 1 saw earth 2 (which i missed the first time because this film is not yet captioned).
5. Rhonda meets herself in the last scene, presumably to ask herself what happened with John and any other astrophysics questions she has. Her other self does not appear to be focused on self-flagellation, so perhaps in earth 2, Rhonda graduated from MIT and became a real astrophysicist, instead of a cleaner.
6. Rhonda signs something to the wise, prophet like janitor while he lay in his hospital bed, I have to watch it a third time to try to transcribe it. I think it is something along the lines of ""I get it."" This makes the viewer further wonder, who is this guy on earth 2?

this begs the main question of the film the age-old question, WHO AM I? To which there is no answer, or no collective answer, each of us must find our own individual answer to this ongoing query.

i see it now upon second viewing as a parallel reality (see for instance The Elegant Universe series on string theory). In this other earth, we have selves which have lives. these other selves trade information with us here on this earth all the time, every time we reflect on anything we see, hear, etc. all sensory impressions are traded back and forth all day long with this other ""self.""  and i believe all night long in dreams. for some those dreams are lucid, for others they are not.

So i am not sure about the ending.  I, like Olly, like a good story, and this one is well-written, well-acted and proves that if a job is well done, it does not need expensive special effects to dress it up, nor will those special effects improve a not so good story not so well told as this one.

I don't see the relationship between Rhoda and John as Olly does.  I don't see her as ""lying"" as much as I did the first time around, even though she herself exhibits shame, remorse, and calls herself a liar.  I think a true liar would have not even ever approached John ""to make amends,"" even though she never really tells us either as Rhonda or as the narrator (since she is both) why she went to John, if only to apologize, after two close viewings, I still did not hear or read any apology.  She does not actually say she is sorry in words, she does it in actions.

Jane Roberts, writing as Seth once said that most human tragedies, most of the pain we cause to one another, what we generally label as ""crime,"" ""evil,"" etc. is unintentional misdirected efforts to ""help,"" that backfire. I have seen quite a few examples of this in my own personal life.  What message I get on the second viewing is that of great empathy for the perp. She was reckless, yes. She shoulda woulda taken a cab.  She paid a price for the lives she took. Some would say not a big enough price. She did, however, in the end, the impossible. She restored, or tried to restore John to the place he would have been had she not been driving drunk that night. By playing around with synchronicity--by altering time as we know it. Did John find his wife and son in earth 2? We'll have to wait for the sequel for that, and the concept is ripe for a TV series, IMHO, similar to the Stargate seri.

we all wonder what if? this movie is a study in many what ifs, makes good viewing for philosophy class, and i hope the high school and college teachers who also share my appreciation for good science fiction give it a watch. it is worth watching at least twice. To end, I'd like to quote Olly B. again, to say we all offer one another ""great redemption"" just by being aware of the echoes we create.  Every action, has an equal and opposite reaction. Every ""shoulda woulda"" may exist physically in a parallel reality. One gets what one focuses most on.",1322870400,,5720,4.666666666666667

4520103,5,B00518JDWW,"I read a lot of reviews attempting to discredit this movie based on the scientific inaccuracies implicit in the movie.  While I cannot disagree with them, I don't think this movie ever billed itself as science fiction.  The movie doesn't spend any significant amount of time attempting to convince the viewer that this is possible.  The entire use of science/alternate universes in the movie is simply a plot device to examine more ""philosophical"" questions.  Indeed the entire concept of alternate universes is entirely theoretical.  However, using this plot device, the movie explores the fragility of our individual lives and the very unlikelihood of our exact existence (and by existence I do not mean in any evolutionary terms but rather the paths our lives take).  The very thought that a simple mistake combined with bad luck/chance at some point in our past or future could completely alter the entire path of our life is fascinating and humbling to me.  I'm not arguing that this movie is amazingly profound, but I think we all have had a moment where we have contemplated a mistake or decision we've made that has changed our lives and wishing we had a chance to change that moment and see where we would be now.

If you go into this movie expecting science fiction, you're bound to be disappointed and may miss the point of the film.  If you watch this movie as a meditation on how chance plays a significant role in our lives, I think you will get what the writers and director were attempting to accomplish.",1322697600,12,1520,4.770992366412214

4520107,2,B00518JDWW,"The far-fetchedness of this story belies the notion that nothing should really surprise us in our age of near magical technology and discovery.  In a mundane world of sadness and tragedy, what would happen if another version of our earth suddenly appeared?  This attempt at a psychological sci-fi tale inverts the known with the unknown and teases with all the possibilities therein.

I wish there were much more joy and mystery in this unusual film of hope amidst the ordinary.  But this is still definitely worth a look.  In my opinion, some of the deleted scenes would've helped finesse the story about this young woman dealing with the pain of causing a tragic accident.

It's too much of the world we know and not enough of the other.",1322352000,2,739,4.734375

4520109,5,B00518JDWW,"I am a self described cinephile, I try to watch at least one movie a day. (luckily a lack of any sort of enjoyable social life allows me this small joy)

I have seen enough thought provoking movies, to know when the questions being asked are genuinely interesting or tainted by banality.

This movie is by far the most interesting movie I have seen this year, and the best drama I have seen so far (and yes I do admit The King's Speech, Shame, Carnage and Drive are close contenders)

Previous reviews have summed up the movie enough that to reiterate would seem...well annoying. But I must say the one question that haunted me the most, that this movie asked in a way that no other has, and is the sole reason that I beckon all of you to give this movie one viewing is:

""If you met yourself, what would you do?"" Every thought you have, every emotion you feel is being felt by the mirror copy in front of you, so would there be anything of substance to be said out loud?

That to me was pretty haunting, I know my community college philosophy probably won't strike anyone's mind as life alerting, but to me this movie did.

The acting, could have been a bit better but I do believe Brit Marling did an exceptional job for a novice. You literally feel the weight of her guilt begin to drag you down too in some parts. So kudos.",1321488000,28,1327,4.288
4520110,1,B00518JDWW,"I'll try not to use words like ""self-indulgent"" and ""masochistic media"" when describing ANOTHER EARTH. It will be hard. And apparently, I've already failed. But here goes.

Drunk driving high school student kills a child, a pregnant mother, and puts professor husband into a coma. She goes to prison for 4 years. When she emerges, she ends up in a romantic affair with the un-coma'ed widower. Then she tells him who she is. Oh, and there's another Earth in the sky.

I'll confess that I went into ANOTHER EARTH expecting to hate it, but just like the proverbial train wreck, I had to see it through to the end. The part about the other Earth struck me as a gimmick. Or something on the order of a question asked by partying college students in the wee small hours. Like ""if you could be any animal..."" In this case, the question is ""if there was another Earth with exact copies of ourselves..."" Never mind the science. The movie ignored it. No tidal waves, no disruption of planetary orbits. (I have a huge ability to suspend disbelief, but this film really over taxed it!)  And at the end, no thought was given to a VERY important question. To describe it would spoil the ending. If that's possible.

I usually like Fox Searchlight films, like Whip It and Waitress. But ANOTHER EARTH is uninspired, obvious, and clearly used the ""ANOTHER EARTH"" facet as a ploy to set it apart from other navel gazing fare.",1321401600,16,1407,4.5936254980079685
4520111,2,B00518JDWW,"This movie, for better or worse, seems to be meant for a different audience than it sells itself to (which no doubt explains the poor box office).  I can forgive some literary liberties being taken with science or realism in the name of entertainment and/or moving a story along.  Dropping an earth-sized planet into space close enough to be seen larger than the moon while not wrecking the planet and climate is science to make Star Wars look like a documentary.  Having it populated by duplicates of us is...I actually have some odds around here somewhere, and astronomical doesn't even begin to cover it.  This is more like an alternate dimmension (think Sliders or the Star Trek - Mirror Mirror universe).  They could have saved their special effects budget, too.

So the movie has made (in my thinking) two crippling scientific blunders while simultaneously missing an obvious and easy alternative, and NOW it wants to get cerebral.  My first thought is, ""why should I believe what you have to say about the human condition when humans are far more complex than gravity, and you can't get gravity right?""

Then I watch Brit's character's mistake and her attempts at making things better, and I don't believe her path represents most people. I do not want to spoil the movie that so many people are enjoying, so how can she be in THAT relationship keeping THAT secret? She seems to be self-destructing slowly, and it almost seems to me like her path through her supposed redemption is simply more of this. The 'twist' at the end reminded me of M. Night (the bad), only not as well done. As much as I would say on it, I can't without spoiling it.

People call this movie 'thought-provoking,' and if you count thoughts like ""Why wasn't this better when you had so much to work with,"" then I suppose it is true.  The cast is solid.  The concept is interesting.  It just all seems to fall flat with me.",1321228800,7,1902,4.6447761194029855
4520112,3,B00518JDWW,"""Can I meet me, is that me better then this me?"" After a car accident changes two lives, Rhoda (Marling) falls into a deep depression. When a chance to win a trip to Earth 2 comes up she finds her chance to start over. Based off the previews I was expecting this to be a sci-fi along the lines of ""Moon"". What I found was that this was more of a character study on how a young girl with everything going for her loses it all. The movie's main plot is how Rhoda can tell the man that she killed his wife and daughter. The aspect of finding Another Earth (which is what I was interested in) is glossed over. If you are looking for a different type of sci-fi movie this is not it at all. The movie is not that bad overall, little slow, but the title is deceiving. Overall, little slow and depressing, should have been called and marketed as something else. This is not what I expected at all. I give it a C.

8452411,1,B00518JDWW,"Chick flicks and science fiction should be on opposite ends of the entertainment spectrum and should never be allowed to approach one another, much less merge into a bastard hybrid...and this film proves my point.

Don't be fooled, ""Another Earth"" is a ponderously, even torturously slow chick flick about a promising teenage astronomy student who destroys an innocent family by her stupid decision to drive drunk.  Her identity concealed (because she's legally a minor at the time of the car crash), she is incarcerated for four years and comes out a humbled soul whose dreams are so dashed that she seeks only the most menial labor as a school janitor.

Desperately needing to apologize, she seeks out the man whose pregnant wife and 5-year-old son were killed in the car crash that she caused.  Yet, when she sees that the widowed husband is even more emotionally damaged than she is, the young woman can't bring herself to confess her guilt.

So, instead, she becomes his housekeeper...and they fall in love.  But there is persistent tension throughout the film because you KNOW the cruel truth cannot remain hidden: ""I love you.  And, by the way, I'm the one who killed your wife and son.""

Yes, THAT is the main plot of this film...It's a tragic-romance chick flick.  So, you may be scratching your head and wondering where the ""science fiction"" comes into play.  Well you may ask.

As a badly-conceived subplot, a duplicate Earth is suddenly discovered not only within our solar system, but nearly in the same orbit as our Earth.  Same planet, same oceans, same continents, same climate, same cities and same human population with the same exact level of civilization.  It's a parallel-reality Earth, in fact, a mirror image world just a stone's throw away (but nobody ever noticed it before).

What. The. Hell...does all of this have to do with the chick-flick plot?

Well, at the very beginning of the film, the sensational discovery of this doppelganger Earth causes our promising teenage astronomy student to celebrate a little too heavily, which precipitates her car wreck.

After that, the parallel-Earth subplot recedes far into the background, such that we only occasionally hear about it through televised news reports.  So, the miraculous existence of a duplicate Earth becomes nothing more than an increasingly-stupid McGuffin for the rest of the film.

Science-fiction, space-fantasy and parallel-universe fans will wince and groan at the preposterous ""science"" that is sparingly offered, not to mention the laughable visual effects.  The other Earth, for example, is depicted as dominating our skies (easily 50X the size of a full moon), so close to us that it would cause cataclysmic gravitational effects on our planet as well as theirs.  This also suggests that the identical moons of the identical planets have overlapping orbits, adding their combined gravitational forces to the disastrous equation.

But, no, there are no mega-earthquakes or super-volcano eruptions or tsunamis, and our planet's atmosphere is not affected in the least...the monstrous duplicate Earth in our sky is just a piece of eye candy for mildly-curious spectators (and gullible audiences).

When the science-fiction subplot directly collides again with the chick-flick main plot (at the very end), writer/director Mike Cahill goes for a perplexing surprise ending.  In the process, however, he creates an enormous plothole: If the widowed husband (from our Earth) is reunited with his wife and family (who survived on the other Earth), then WTF happened to the OTHER husband on the other Earth?  Either there are two pissed-off identical husbands on the other planet, or somebody got some 'splainin' to do.

The cinematography is very good, as is the acting; but the snailpace of the poorly-conceived story and its plodding heartstring-tugging soundtrack are punishing.  Punishing, I tell you.",1526515200,,3894,5.1904
