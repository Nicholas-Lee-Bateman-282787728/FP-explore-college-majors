through at my own pace.  Thanks!",1486252800,,160,4.482758620689655
8419864,5,B004A9S4EQ,"I love this DVD , it is one oft favorites, i love the cute moves,combinations and the extra bonus material is sooooo amazing.",1413763200,,125,4.478260869565218
8419865,5,B004A9S4EQ,"At first I did not know what to make of this dvd as it goes into a lot of areas that I did not expect. Niraja is OBVIOUSLY very knowledgeable about this dance, and she shares a lot not pertaining to the drum solo, but to the dance form itself. I especially liked the choreo performed as solo, duo, and group with several different body types. There are not a lot of dvds which vary awary from the ""hollywood"" body types. Great to see some regular people and bellydancers of color.",1358380800,,480,4.285714285714286
8419866,5,B004A9S4EQ,"Looking at the preview of this dvd I was not going to purchase it. Then MJ had a closeout sell at filmbaby.com and I ordered it. By far I think this has been an extremely good pruchase. The drum solo is fun and upbeat. Instructions are clear. She offers more than just a nice choreography and the price is excellent.
Intro-is the same preview that cheeky girls gives you about the dvd.
warm-up- this warm-up is not to strenuous and focuses a lot on the upper body.
preview of movements- this is where she shows the movements that will be used, and breaks them down. The breakdowns are brief,and are not drilled at any length. This preview include barrel spins, undulating hops, grapevine,chasse and choo choo shimmies.
Gestures and accents. include round about, straight on, hand push,gun slinger,open palm,wnough,bineg shy,saying no,fall in love,oriental w,fingers to forehead, yalla hands, lead the audience,break of a piece,lack of movement.
Choreography breakdown, after each breakdown there is a practice session. There are 11 sections in this breakdown.
Full choreography
Extended practice
Choreography performed-Duet choreography- was a bit off, troupe choregography I enjoyed.
Extras-live performance. I loved this live performance. It was so fun and so full of persoanlity. She performed this drum solo in her second song. Extra performance with commentary- Very useful she is talking about how she performs. Dancing in footwear-high heels. Lebanese style,I think this was a nice introduction to lebanese style of dance, she even gives you a secret backbend tip She is dancing with a cane in this section. What is the complete package-this is where dancers tell you what the complete package is and hands down they all say having stage presence is a high priority.

To me she has the perfect instructional style. Her words are clear, she has a nice soothing voice and she is very patient and calm. She reminds me very much of a yoga instructor. This dvd is more than a drum solo. You could very well take some of the things discussed in this dvd and apply it to your own dance. The dvd is great for learning expressivity. Lotus is a dancer that very much connects with her audience and in this dvd she is also showing you how. She does not use super complex movements, indeed most of them I would say seem very basic to intermediate,but the attitude and stage presence it would take to pull this off is amazing. Also like most drum solo's the timing is fast so even though these are not sadie technical moves it will take some work to get them smooth. My initial reaction to the choreogaphy was that I didn't like it, but after trying it-I will say that I modified some parts to better suit my style but I like it. It is upbeat, energetic and all around fun to dance too.

Cons:
I would have prefered if the mirror she used was a full studio mirror instead of the one she had.
I would have prefered if her hip scarf was shorter. Sometimes It cuts off the visual of the movements of her legs.

Okay so was this dvd worth it? I got this on sale at film baby for $9.50 and yes at that price I would say it was more than worth it. But for the asking price of $20.00? If you love lotus Niraga style or would like practice with adding more emotion and gestures into your dance then yes. Like I stated before this dvd is so much more than just a drum solo. Compared to other drum solo dvd's on the market. Yes this dvd was worth it. If you are looking for a very tehnical choreography then this is not the dvd for you.",1325289600,4,3527,4.5879556259904914
8419867,3,B004A9S4EQ,"I really like this artist and enjoy her live performances. I watch her on youtube a lot. I was disappointed with this video because I was expecting to learn a full out drum solo the way she usually does them. So here's the problem....the promotional trailer was very very short and didn't show us what we were going to be learning. It also didn't label the video as beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Initially, I thought the dancer didn't share her normal integrity of dance. After years of purchasing dvds, I came to understand that what the dancers are teaching is fine, the dvd's  are just not labeled with a level and they do not give enough information prior to purchase. If you are a begging dancer, I think this dvd is a very good start. It is a comprehensive introduction into learning accents and putting your technique to use.",1308182400,,839,4.630872483221476
8419868,5,B004A9S4EQ,"Let me first say that I have had the opportunity to take several workshops with Lotus, and enjoyed them immensely! She is so full of energy, attitude, skill and knowledge!  That being said I was very excited to receive this DVD, and...it did not let me down.  In this DVD, her energy clearly shines through, as Lotus shares some of the many things you LOVE about her and her dancing...like ""breaking off a piece"".  I even enjoyed the warm-up! After which she then gives information on concepts and techniques. And then breakdowns of the choreography,  and practice.  She does not give a breakdown of the most of the movements/isolations, which is why, as a teacher, I don't think I would suggest this DVD for beginners. It is very much geared to maybe an advanced beginner/intermediate and above (those with a good foundation of basics and beyond). And for these dancers, once absorbed will add spice and interest to your dancing, and not just your drum solo!  All of that being said, this DVD is a treasure in my collection!",1302652800,2,1025,4.698324022346369
8419869,5,B004A9S4EQ,"I have had the pleasure of seeing Lotus dance up close and personal. This DVD is fantastic and emits the energy and joy Lotus has when she performs. I definitely recommend this DVD as the perfect example of what stage presence and personality is all about! Lotus, You go girl!",1301875200,,276,4.54
8419870,4,B004A9S4EQ,"This DVD is packed with information, so it's hard to review it as a whole. To use an overused turn of phrase, it's like a box of chocolates.  Some of the chocolates are fantastic; Others you leave for someone else.  I really like Lotus Niraja's outlook on dance - that it's fun, cheeky, and about entertainment.  It melds well with my own dance philosophy, that we dancers are there to make people feel good and start the party.  She starts the DVD out with a discussion on gestures, which was not what I expected (I was expecting perhaps Arabic gestures) - but more of a guide to gestures she uses in the drum solo, and not particularly rooted in a particular culture.  But that's OK - these gestures are FUN.  Of course, they may be signature Lotus Niraja and so it may not be advisable to copy all of them for yourself.

The choreography itself was quite challenging.  It certainly didn't fall into the 4 of everything trap.  The movements themselves were not all that difficult - there was no floorwork, only one sudden drop, and very few stomach isolations.  It was the way it was put together - fast, lots of directional changes, and tons of variety in the movements used. The drum solo music itself was quite dynamic but also earthy.  LN integrates a lot of turns and spins into her drum solos.  I loved some of the ideas, like the choo-choo shimmy combined with pulling the audience in.  Mainly it was the gestures that really captured me - adding such an element of fun into the dance!

She teaches clearly, but some transitions were awkward in how the combinations were cut.  In other words, it didn't seem designed as individual combinations, combined into a drum solo - it was more like a long, flowing drum solo that had to be artificially sectioned off.  I would have preferred if the DVD had a ""from the top"" option after the combo practice, to practice how each combo fit into the whole.

Because Lotus Niraja directs the NDC, she has a lot of experience with choreographing for multiple dancers.  So, this DVD shows the choreography performed and adapted for one dancer, two dancers, and a troupe.  It was really informative from a choreographer's perspective to see the dance adapted in this way.  And from a dancer's perspective, it was great to see the dance performed by different body types!  Lotus Niraja herself was pregnant when she filmed this.  While at times it made it difficult to discern exactly what she was doing (well, for that reason and that she was wearing all black), I thought it was totally cool.  I danced when I was pregnant and I loved it.  So, seeing Lotus's beautiful belly, I was totally cheering her on!  I bet she has a beautiful baby now.

The extras section contains so much, everything from Lebanese cane, a topic that I've never seen taught elsewhere, to dancing in high heels.  She also included a full performance with and without commentary.",1296000000,4,2896,4.616438356164384
8419871,4,B004A9S4EQ,"Disclaimer: I received this DVD as part of a give-away from the producer.

While this DVD is marketed as a drum solo DVD, this DVD offers much more. I enjoyed Lotus's narration; it wasn't 100% perfectly flowing, but she was warm, funny, and very good at explaining what she meant. I liked that she started the DVD explaining her terminology and giving demos of what she meant. Because belly dance technique names are not standard, this was useful to be able to follow along. She gave a lot of interesting ideas for gestures and explained how they can impact the audience.

The drum solo choreography was fun and a bit fast paced; this is not a DVD for a beginner. I am an intermediate dancer, and I needed to ""rewind"" a few times during the instructions. I liked seeing the choreography done as a solo, duet, and a group dance; it gives good ideas of how this choreography (or any choreography, really) can be modified according to the group. I like the emphasis on making this choreography yours to be used, rather than merely copying things.

Like all Cheeky Girls DVD, the production value is high quality. Audio is clear and the instructor is in focus with nothing distracting in the background. Because the filming was done in front of a mirror, you can see the front and backside of the instructor.

What I didn't like was that I felt that a lot of topics were covered on one DVD and it wasn't all related. Lotus went into information about Lebanese cane, dancing in heels, and performance information. I felt like the cane and performance parts could have been their own DVDs; I even would argue that the gestures section could be its own DVD. Lotus Niraja was excellent on this DVD, and it seemed like maybe these other topics could have been saved for another DVD and included more information on drum solos, like working with a live drummer.

I definitely plan on working with this DVD more and hope to see Lotus Niraja in more instructional DVDs.",1292976000,5,1957,4.595988538681948
