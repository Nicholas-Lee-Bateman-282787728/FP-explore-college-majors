6228804,1,B00HV76I1A,"I bought this movie for my daughter. She was so excited. After getting we had a movie night and when i put it in, it wouldn't play. I checked the box and it said it played english, dutch, and french. i checked the country where the distributer was from and it was USA in NC. So, it should have been an American format. The disk wouldn't read because the region code was different from any other ""AMERICAN"" disk. I ended up having to purchase another copy from Best Buy. REGION CODE!!!!!!!",1364169600,,488,4.373626373626373

6228806,1,B00HV76I1A,"Nice DVD, however I would have prefered a big, fat, WARNING written in bright red letters that stated that this disc was for non-US REgions!

8636299,1,B00HV76I1A,Apparently this dvd was made in  Norway and won't work in American dvd players. This  information was not included in the description otherwise I never would have purchased it.  I can't even return it because I was so sure it was a normal dvd that I threw  away the receipt.,1387324800,3,274,4.42
8636300,2,B00HV76I1A,"Since the DVD was made in England, and I wanted to play it in the US, my DVD player had to be multi-regional. And it's not. Apparently the comment section told me this prior to ordering. My fault. I can play it on my computer, and it is not cost effective to send it back so I will just chalk it down to experience.",1385510400,,315,3.9375

8636303,1,B00HV76I1A,"There was no disclaimer stating the DVDs would not play in the US; however, they would not work.  The DVD player plays all other discs, but displays a message ""disc cannot be read in this region"" for these discs.  Disappointed.",1371772800,2,227,4.65
