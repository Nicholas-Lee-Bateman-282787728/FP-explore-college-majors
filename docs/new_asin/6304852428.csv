933194,4,6304852428,"PLOT:
Toxie is back one again, but he's rid Tromaville of all its crime so he is bored and depressed. Meanwhile the bad guys have devised a plan to rid Troma of Toxie by sending him to Japan to meet his father. While Toxie is away, the bad guys come out to play and take over the city. Will Toxie return from Japan in time to save the day? Well, duh, how else would it spawn 2 more sequels!?

Review
TA is a dark comedy full of action, horror and comedy that will not be accepted by people who take things too seriously. It is an over the top, cult style film. It's a breath of fresh air to have a movie with actors who aren't trying to steal the spotlight, or use the film as a stepping-stone to further there acting credibility for future reference. This movie would never win any academy award. But that's what we love about because we hate the academy awards anyway. Toxie is just a great movie of the little guy that was always pushed around finds himself in a situation that leads to him finishing on top...and also some wacky, gross, disgusting, silly, over drawn, ridicules things along the way. It's a fun movie but not something to sit down with grandma to watch.

The directors cut version is awsome. For those fans of the original who said part 2 was not as good, then I suggest you check out this DC version. Scenes where cut from both the R-Rated version and the Directoes Cut released last time. This time they actualy have got the directors cut, the last version wasnt, this time it has the blood and gore back in it and it makes the film great. The violence in the opening scene at the blind house has been put back in, and when Toxie destroys a crippled henchmen, it is just as good as the headcrushing scene of TA1! This time around it should satisfy the fans who didn't like the second one for not being gorey or voilent enough.

DVD
Finally I was able to sit down, kick back and relax and watch the Toxic Avenger clearly and as a bonus, uncut. I've had the first 3 Toxies on VHS for years, but the videos where bad quality, warn out and the image was always rolling and fading, the sound was dropping in and out... so even tho I've been a fan of Toxie for years, I felt like I was watching it for the first time.

The quality isn't super great, there is still speckles here and there, but it's clear enough not to worry about it, they polished it up as best they could and you'll only see the dust speckles if your purposely looking for them.

The sound wasn't surround sound, but it didn't matter, least it was clear and loud enough to understand what was being said.

Bonus Features
Like many of the Troma DVD's, TA2 is packed with great bonus features..
- Interviews - There is heaps of interviews with Lloyd Kaufman (Producer/President of Troma) & Mitch Cohen (Toxic Avenger) plus many more of the actors and directors.
- Commentary - Interesting
- Intro to the movie by Lloyd
- Cartoon of Toxie's Birthday party.
- Plus a heap more stuff and regular things you find on every Troma DVD like the tour of Troma, and how to make a movie things etc.

Cons:
- A lot of the bonus features look like where recorded off a VHS, but who cares, there only bonus features, the movie is fine.
- No subtitles -
- no out-takes, gag-reel, bloopers.
- No deleted scenes -
- Menus are a bit confusing to navigate -

As you can see, the positive weighs down the negatives enough to show that Troma has once again presented a great movie with a great DVD package.",1118880000,,3468,4.292048929663609
933195,5,6304852428,"What's with all the fuss? Toxie 2 is just as much fun as Toxie 1 in my opinion. It's a bit more light hearted and less... uhh... strange than the first, but lets face it, this one has some great dismemberment (some of Troma's best), slapstick gore and plenty of satirical humor and 7th grade bathroom laughs. Plus it's absolutely cute (as all Toxic Avenger films are). The plot is a spoof of all those ""on a quest to find my long lost father"" stories and takes Toxie to Japan. It's also a perfect example of Troma's philosophy concerning unethical big businesses and monopolies, represented by the satanic Apocalypse Inc. Some people consider this film to somehow be sub-par for Troma. I say, believe me, they've done much worse!  I loved this move just as much as the original. Maybe it's the fact that when I saw the film for the first time it was the uncut version included in the Tox Box. One scene in particular that has left a lasting impression on me, is where Toxie literally breaks a guy in two! It must be seen to be believed. I also enjoyed the way they developed Toxie's character. He's a sensitive, golden hearted, somewhat dim witted, yet lovable Episcopalian, but once those ""Tromatons"" (Troma's version of ""Spidey Sense"") are aggravated, he becomes a rampaging evil-destroying machine. And as we all know, Toxie doesn't just beat up criminals, he smashes their heads, rips off their limbs and disembowels them. He gets pretty creative with it too. Overall this movie is a lot of fun. That was its purpose and that is what it accomplishes.",1097452800,,1554,4.650909090909091
933196,1,6304852428,"How do Troma have the nerve to sell this as the Director's Cut? It's missing most of the gore, violence and comedy that can be found in the true uncut version available in Japan. Troma always cram their DVDs with extras, some of them quite good, but that doesn't make up for ripping customers off with a useless version of one of their better films.",1010534400,,349,4.384615384615385
933197,2,6304852428,I saw toxie 1 and thought it was the best then I rented part 2 hopeing it would be as good not a chance. First toxies face looked better in the first and his arms didn't look bubbly just white. Also what happend to all the mindless gore instead they have cartoon violence. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the voice sounds better then in the first one and when he was on the toilet.,994118400,2,394,4.0
933198,5,6304852428,"This movie is only good because it has the spectacular Phoebe Legere in it.  She is the star. Where is her name? She is gorgeous, she is a true comedienne in the tradition of Groucho and Chaplin,  and she even plays  accordion while acting up a storm.",925084800,,251,4.297872340425532
933255,3,6304852428,"The evil corporation Apocalypse, Inc. sets its sights on Tromaville as its new toxic waste dump, but one hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength stands in their way... The Toxic Avenger! Toxie is tricked into taking a trip to Japan to reunite with his long lost father, while Apocalypse, Inc. moves in to take over the town. If you thought the villains in Tromaville were wacky, wait until you get a load of the Japanese! Toxie faces off with ninjas, Kabuki warriors, Japanese schoolgirl transvestites, sumo wrestlers, and a new mutant menace before discovering Apocalypse's evil plot. All of the gratuitous, ultra-violent action and gore returns in THE TOXIC AVENGER PART II, topped off with plenty of the same ridiculous humor from before, but while the head-smashing, gut-ripping, and random acts of violence against fish are always welcome, the seemingly endless action sequences begin to ware as they pad out the run-time. Much of the cleverness has been dulled down as well, only to be replaced by stupid sight gags and more trashy exploitation, but who's complaining? Troma fans are sure to enjoy THE TOXIC AVENGER PART II just as much as the original.

933259,3,6304852428,"So, I recently saw the first Toxic Avenger for the first time and I thought it was so cool and funny. The second movie wasn't as good. The story is really good, but the directing and acting wasn't good. Toxic Avenger doesn't look as good as he did in the first. Now he looks more plastic and very bulky. Toxic girlfriend played by Phoebe Legere is the worse actor in the whole movie. She was way over the top with her performance and she was bouncing all over the place. Toxic girlfriend seems like a real slut and innocent anymore. When the Toxic Avenger goes to Japan she meets a Japanese friend and her performance was better than Legere. The only thing with the Japanese girl performance is that she doesn't sound Japanese. She has more of a Vietnamese accent going on.

The Toxic Avenger fights scenes aren't as good because they are too cheesy to watch now. When Toxic fought the Kabuki Men, he just runs off to get new weapons so many times. This lets the Kabuki Men slowly move towards the Japanese girl to hurt her. It seems really stupid that they would slowly walk to her and not get her many times. Also, I feel that when Toxic had to fight with the fish head man, they could had made that into a better and longer battle. It would seem like he would be a great rival, but instead he took him out faster than anyone else he fought. That was so bad.

I really wish this movie would had been better, but it's not the worse ever movie to watch. So, it's just average to me.",1316995200,,1482,4.270462633451957
933260,5,6304852428,"This is actually my favorite Toxic Avenger movie, mostly because of his gentle monologue throughout the entire movie to the home audience at various moments declaring his inner most feelings and accomplishments. This movie, unlike the first, shows him in his superhero entirety physical abiltiy, where as the first never quite showed his face very much.
The other thing I liked was his trip to Japan and his funny entanglements with the japanese natives in the homeland customs including the food traditions, and fighting styles.
There is alot of action to this movie, and an ample amount of bloody gore in the introduction fighting scenes, but the movie focuses on action and story.  And just when you think the movie has ended, it goes into a rambling car chase sequence which is very fun to watch like car chase scenes ususally are, but here it is the action finale.
The gags are plentiful, but again, the Toxie's continuous monologue is nice to listen to because it lets us into his thoughts. And the voice actor who does this has the perfect tone for it acting upon the naive yet justice prevail determination.  We even get to see Toxie having sex with his blind girlfriend before he sets off on his journey with smoke coming out of both his ears. They didn't do this in the first one, they just fought alot. I love the Toxie, and got the complete Toxic Avenger set, with cartoons of Toxie. See ya!",1300838400,,1403,4.653225806451613

Melvin, had destroyed all of the evil in Tromaville until Apocalypse Inc moves into town. Apocalypse Inc. wants to take over Tromaville, so they devise a plan to get the Toxic Avenger out of Tromaville long enough for them to take over the town. The Toxic Avenger is sent to Japan on a quest to find his father. In his absence the people of Tromaville have no choice but to do what the Apocalypse Inc want them to do. Of course once the Toxic Avenger returns he takes on the Apocalypse and runs them out of town. The Toxic Avenger Part II is nowhere as good as the original Toxic Avenger, but it is far from terrible.

However the greedy chemical company known as ""Apocalypse Inc."" conducted by the evil chairman has plans to take over Tromaville as Toxie goes to Japan to find him. Over there he must find his long lost father that he hasn't seen in a long time, meanwhile Apocalypse Inc has taken control of Tromaville and it's bad news for Toxie, can he find his father so he can return to save Tromaville or will he fail?

Although inferior to the original cult horror action comedy classic, it still provides good laughs and nice splatter here. The acting is laughable as the usual Troma movie and so is the writing, what's missing is the original blind girlfriend Sarah from the first movie but suddenly they replaced the character with a new blind chick named Claire i dunno why and some of the charm that made the original a great horror comedy. Neverthless it's a funny movie but doesn't hold a candle to the first one and ""Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger part 2"" even though there are some nice hot chicks in this movie.

The DVD contains the unrated uncut version has good picture and sound with some good extras like introduction by Troma founder/Toxie creator Lloyd Kaufman, interactive tour of the Troma building, audio commentaries, Toxie 2 on Japanese TV clips, still gallery, trailers to this and other Troma releases and scenes of Tromaville Cafe.",1177891200,,1562,4.781481481481482
