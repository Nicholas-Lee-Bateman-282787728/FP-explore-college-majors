1420904,4,B00005B6LQ,"A darn good movie by any stretch.  Yes, like the reviews below, the rowers ""could"" have been better.  And yes, this is a sort-of tribute to Tiff Woods let's-film-The Amateurs-in-video.  But really, it is so much more.  For non-rowers, or those of lesser skills than enthusiasm (like me) it is a beautiful art-book-on-film complete with emotions.  And given the few films out there on rowing, I would say the director did an admirable job.  Certainly if you have non-rowing friends you wouldn't be ashamed to screen them this film to give them some sense of what the sport is all about.  And compared to Oxford Blues, this is a visual and acting masterpiece!  Don't let the hard-core rowers turn you off on this film.",1115337600,13,716,4.717741935483871
1420905,1,B00005B6LQ,"I guess things must balance out for Tiff Wood.  After having his Olympic efforts being beautifully chronicled by David Halberstam in ""The Amateurs"", he is portrayed as a childish, selfish  buffoon in this pointless movie.  The novice level rowing aside, this movie makes ""Oxford Blues"" look like ""Chariots of Fire"" or ""Breaking Away"" as far as a well made, inspiring sports movie.  Unfortunately, I know of no decent rowing movie that has been made.  ""A Fine Balance"" by Brad Lewis is a very good film but it is a documentary.
To summarize, the rowing is terrible, one develops no affection for any of the characters, and the historical facts are skimmed over.  Brad Lewis, the only main character in Halberstam's book to win an Olympic gold medal, is mentioned only as ""Paul Enquist's partner"".  I consider Mr. Lewis one of the lucky ones in this regard.  Save your money and read the book instead.  Or you can have my DVD copy for free.",1062892800,9,938,4.705521472392638
1420906,4,B00005B6LQ,"Certainly the actors had less than perfect rowing form.  And this does limit the amount of footage of edit-free rowing that can be shown.  However I was surprised that they found actors who could row at all.  And I was also pleasantly surprised at the professional level of film making in terms of photography, sound, editing and acting.  Since this is the only dramatization of rowing that I am aware of it is easily recommended.  Highly evocative of the colors, sounds and feel of the sport.  So overall authenticity (given the actors marginal rowing skills) is preserved.
If I wanted to watch rowing skills I can put in a VHS of the Olympics or maybe last years IRAs.  I think the producer / director of ""Rowing Through"" had other intentions.",1018051200,7,745,4.684615384615385
1420907,2,B00005B6LQ,"As a former oarsman, this film is a major disappointment.  While visually stunning, it suffers from a major flaw: none of the actors can row at a level anywhere close to the one they are supposed to be at. As a result, despite grunting and grimacing, they cannot convey the true spirit of the sport: the combination of pain, power and grace.  Besides making the story difficult to believe, it also prevents the director from getting us into a ""rowing rhythm"" as what would otherwise be flowing scenes must be shortened and edited to avoid showing too many obvious ""crabs"".  Too bad.",996796800,7,582,4.686274509803922

My question is....who the heck is this guy in the movie they call Tiff?? Maybe there isba 3hout version somewhere with more detail, exposition and gap-filling material. But if you want to make rowing more popular, gather up all the dvds of this movie and burn them! Read The Amateurs instead. Oh wait. I forgot. America doesn't read any more. Tiff, I  still think you're a great guy!",1437004800,,498,4.533333333333333

I who know nothing about rowing will be looking forward to watching the rowing in the Olympics this year.",1342915200,2,246,4.369565217391305
7936749,3,B00005B6LQ,"I felt that there was too much unsaid concerning the relationships among the characters and the circumstances, and that this left the story murky and unsatisfying.

7936750,1,B00005B6LQ,"A lot of rowers comment on the horrible technique of the actors who portray this Olympic level rowers.  Hey, its not just that.  Its the whole movie.  The acting is baaad... the story line is baaad...  Its not interesting at all! It gives the sport a horrible image cause, hey, the movie is dull as my scissors.  The most exciting part of the film for me is when they showed the Montreal basin (I row there).  I watched it simply for kicks tonight and unfortunately, will have to pay for it with my early 6am row tomorrow.",1149552000,3,522,4.329896907216495
7936751,1,B00005B6LQ,"My name is XENO and I took part as an extra in the movie.

Once I sat through the movie, I can safely say that Rowing Through is deadly boring.  The movie drags on for ever.  To us rowers, it is a known fact, that rowing skills shown by actors in motion pictures are mostly horrible.  (The only capable actors were M.Streep and G. Davis.)  Besides having made some pocket change back then as an extra, I am VERY HAPPY that NO ONE (in the small world of rowing) can tell that I was even remotely part of this failed attempt to portray a phenomenal Olympic effort.
