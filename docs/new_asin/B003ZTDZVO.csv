The package came with two DVDs: first, the historic championship game, as broadcast, from back in the 80s; second, the documentary on how that LLWS year impacted the players, coaches, and parents.  Good job!",1515456000,,299,4.8431372549019605

8410961,5,B003ZTDZVO,"This documentary about the 1982 Little League Champions is a stirring account of the first USA team to reclaim the title after years of Taiwanese dominance.  In the telling, we learn about a pitcher who's athleticism and curveball led the team to victory, but we also see how all the players contributed as a team.  Interviews with the players as adults reveal the emotional connection they had to each other, the love and respect they had for their coaches, and their joy of playing those games as kids.  Some of the closeup interviews will bring tears to your eyes, as they talk about the aftermath of the World Series, and how the boys were thrust into the limelight, and forced to confront the expectations of a not always compassionate adult world.",1350432000,,753,4.732824427480916
8410962,5,B003ZTDZVO,"Saw this story on ESPN and decided I have to get it for my nephew, who played Little League ball in Oregon, and is just starting high school there.  I think every kid who plays Little League ball should see this film, if for nothing else, to make them realize that there are positive and negative consequences to almost everything in life.  Too often, all that they hear or imagine are the positives.  Little League is an incredible opportunity for many, often the first chance for a real ""team"" experience.  The reality of the pressures they experience can be applied even in daily, routine Little League play.  A young player doesn't have to go to the LL World Series to understand that.  I think this film can help put a lot of that pressure in perspective for your average youngster who has a dream to one day play in Williamsport on the big stage.",1286323200,2,852,4.5
