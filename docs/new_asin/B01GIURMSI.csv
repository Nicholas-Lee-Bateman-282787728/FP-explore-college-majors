7760311,5,B01GIURMSI,"Great entertainment, with strong lead characters and an interesting setting, complete with gorgeous scenery.  I like the fact that the conflict and issues are really and not meaningless soap opera drama. A lot is at stake and it keeps the tension simmering throughout. I am sorry if it is not renewed for a second season, but that is no reason to give THIS season a low rating.  Definitely worth watching. Solid drama as only British TV can deliver.",1483228800,5,449,4.743589743589744
7760312,1,B01GIURMSI,"Hate it because it was cancelled so there is no tie-up, no justice. Just a guy shot down like a dog & girl waiting for her wedding. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING ANY OF THIS
It isn't going to have any conclusion for any of the characters.
Brilliant acting. Interesting story lines. One guy an utter evil bastard (Coates)
But never mind, it was cancelled. So you will watch FOUR hours plus & then be left hanging!",1483056000,,414,4.32051282051282

7760318,5,B01GIURMSI,"I've just finished watching JERICO on DVD and I want to give it the highest rating for its production values, acting, storyline, costuming...everything.  When I first looked at the cover, I thought it seemed a bit odd, a western type railroad story set in England?  I started watching and from the very first I was caught up in the story.  The 1870's in England for most people was much like the 1870's in America, and if you had business or personal problems in town, you moved to the frontier to start over.  Annie Quaintain has been recently widowed and her late husbands debts have forced her to sell everything and find a new life. When her last recourse for shelter doesn't work out, she takes her two children and the belongings they have left and ride the train to the end of the line.  There is rumor that work can be had near the construction of the Culverdale viaduct.  This ambitious project is supposed to extend the railroad into very rural Northern England.  The scenery is gorgeous and we are already fans of Jessica Raine and she is wonderful in the role of Annie giving her strength and courage as well as manners and sense.  Pioneering is difficult and there are challenges that American Western fans will recognize, sickness, loss of job, unethical behavior by those in charge.  Along with the challenges are moments of great sweetness, and kindness.  People become a community in spite of human nature's selfish tendencies..  It is heartbreaking and humbling as well as inspiring to see how these people manage to live through the hardships and obtain moments of victory, heroic and good.  This belongs in all collections of good pioneering stories, railway stories, and human drama. This makes me want to read more about the railway development and progress in England....how is it different from America?  If a town like Jericho builds up on property that is already owned by a landlord, how is that accomplished and handled, and can the town exist and keep growing....",1475193600,5,1992,4.7894736842105265
7760319,5,B01GIURMSI,"I was devastated that Hell on Wheels, the American Railroad dramatization ended. Immediately its replace for me with Jericho and may Jericho last for at least 5 season as well. Visit the Yorkshire Dales of 1870s in a true town/story dramatized as the rugged Victorian shantytown period story of Jericho. It is a place where a town lived rough for 7 years as a RR viaduct was constructed. It is the story of the navvy life, a term derived from navigator engineering, but largely referred to the laborers, a smarmy sort, not unlike the builders of the American RR to the American West.
Filming locals, costumes, music, props, sets, dialogue, and acting are period entertaining and seem realistic enough for the era. The talented convincing cast is led by Jessica Raine (Call the Midwife) as Annie and Hans Matheson (Christmas Candle & Doctor Zhivago) as Johnny. Over a dozen appear in every episode, like Clarke Peters (Person of Interest) as Coates; Daniel Rigby (Lillies) as Charles; Sophie Thompson (Emma Harry Potter) as Lizzie a saloon owner; well, cant say enough, and cant mention them all. And there are guest start for episodes such as Dean Andrews (Last Tango in Halifax Life on Mars), Sean Gilder (H.Hornblower Gangs of NY) and Michael Culkin (Poldark) to name but 3.

SDH SUBTITLES available for all episodes, each nearly 50 min. + the Bonus of 40 min.
&nbsp;==Newly widowed Annie liquidates and heads with 2 kids (Samuel Bottomley & Amy James-Kelly) 15 miles away to the RR viaduct site in Culverdale Valley in pursuit of work and a new life. A hard beginning, the likes you cant imagine.
&nbsp;==A railway detective searches for sabotage criminal and a secret is near being exposed. Jericho construction community hosts some violent wild times.
&nbsp;==Jerichos viaduct funding requires a wedding of convenience. Enemies are made over trade of goods and health scare creates panic. Rich/poor, black/white divides get blurred.
&nbsp;==Annie continues to struggle with the new Jericho home and family affairs. New Viaduct investors are entertained
[5]]  ==Viaduct financing difficulties trickle down to the laboring navies.
&nbsp;==Viaduct financing difficulties trickle down to the laboring navies.
&nbsp;==The new quarry needed for the viaduct stone is planned for a location sure to unearth the volatile nerves of the village.
&nbsp;==A murder suspect is being held and the tavern readied for his trial. Will justice prevail?
&nbsp;==Some success for Jericho and the viaduct ahead of a disaster. Romances have ups and downs. Please begin season 2, and 3, and 4

Bottom line: I loved it all the way through. Will watch it again and again until the next season is available. Unfortunately it took 2 years to do this series, hopefully with much set done, new episodes will develop fast.",1473206400,6,2796,5.087145969498911
7760320,4,B01GIURMSI,It is a very good series but some of the acting sucks.  So four stars,1471219200,,69,3.6
7760321,5,B01GIURMSI,"Surprisingly, this show does have the feel of an American western yet takes place in England.  I found the story compelling, and the acting first rate.  I was sorry to read that there will not be a season 2.  A real shame because they should have few more episodes to wrap things up.  Even with no further season I found the show highly satisfying.",1470873600,3,348,4.390625
7760322,5,B01GIURMSI,Look forward to a second season. Well written and enjoy learning the personalityof the characters,1470614400,2,97,5.533333333333333

7760325,5,B01GIURMSI,I truly enjoyed this program and I am sad that it was canceled. I am even more upset for the reasons given for cancelation. It is harder and harder to find programs that are written for the sake of quality and are willing to forgo violence that is popular for todays  era. Such a shame that there won't be a second season.,1470268800,10,322,4.193548387096774

8762992,3,B01GIURMSI,What's with the hair-hat Annie is wearing?! The wig isn't even the same color as other hair. Also so many flaws in real life of the time. Very unrealistic. Lots of plot going nowhere. Mildy entertaining.,1538352000,,203,4.666666666666667

8762994,4,B01GIURMSI,"I really enjoyed and watched all 8 episodes in one setting.  Did not quite follow all the complexities of the characters and the events and would have loved to read a book, if available to clarify some questions.  Especially was it not clear to me Coates' involvement in the cave-in?",1524873600,,283,4.64

8762996,1,B01GIURMSI,"Why do I have to give it a star? A witheringly bad overall production. The script writing, stiff acting, and directing were barely worthy of a middle school melodrama. A total waste of money.",1519603200,,191,4.647058823529412
