6074217,5,B00GEDKJVW,"This is a great dvd of the International Harvester equipment advertising films from the 1940s.  I loved seeing all the ""new"" advertising for the Farmall Cub that comes in this video.
Out of the three Farmall Classic Films DVDs this one is my least favorite because half of it is about Soil Conservation rather than the IH advertising.  Not much tractor action in that segment.
But overall I still really enjoyed the DVD.",1387238400,5,420,4.739726027397261

8622498,5,B00GEDKJVW,"These are very interesting videos - not just about tractors, but about the soil conservation efforts being made at this time. I have enjoyed watching it several times with my children. There was a good deal about the Farmall Cub Tractor in this video collection.",1424649600,,262,4.844444444444444
