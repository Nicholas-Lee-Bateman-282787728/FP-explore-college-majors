The story steps back and unfolds. The characters, even the a-holes are believable and lovable, and utterly hilarious. It is the perfect blend of horror and comedy. This is not Shaun of the Dead, this is a very dark and bloody tale that is full of gut busting funny moments. I absolutely loved it.

2887601,5,B000SM6FM2,"I had mixed thoughts about buying this film on DVD - British films can be very hit or miss - WOW , what a surprise with this one - great cast / great acting / great script / edge of your seat action / realistic reactions from the cast , as you would expect if these events were happening in real life . This is an excellent original concept for a film using humour , fear , gore , horror , action , self preservation to perfection in the right doses and in the right places.

Most certainly in a far higher league than a previous reviewer wrote in Amazon.co.uk - saying it was as good as Dog Soldiers and 28 Days - those two films i would rate as very mediocre in comparison .

BUY IT - It's better than most films coming out of Hollywood at the moment .

2887602,5,B000SM6FM2,"I checked this one out not expecting much & was shocked to have loved it by the end of the movie.  This is a true ""slasher"" (although there's more to it than just a scary monster guy running around in the woods hacking up teens)flick in every sense of the word.  Now the box's cover art claims this to be a comedy/horror flick in the same line as ""The Office"", & ""Shaun Of The Dead"".  Maybe I missed something, but I didn't get that.  While the movie does have it's moments, it's more amusing, than it is just straight out comedy.  You'll get some definate chuckles, but I doubt very seriously the film was intended to be strictly just a comedy.  The blood & gore is definately there & done very well, & you really get a sense of danger by the end of the movie.  The movie is actually really brutal too, which I always like to see; alot of the violence is kinda believable.

  A brief synopses(as not to spoil the movie) is you've got a group of people going out on a company retreat.  These people happen to be employees of a weapons manufacturer.  Anyway there transpotation winds up breaking down on the way & they find a place out in the woods that they at 1st assume is the designated retreat area.  After that things start to get bloody and that's all you really need to know.  The movie is well acted, & the characters are well fleshed out so you really care what happens to 'em (which doesn't happen very often in horror flicks).  Anyway, this is gonna be a sleeper hit, so make sure all you gore hounds & horror freaks check this one out.  It's at very least worth a rental if not worthy of your very own collection/library at home.  There's just something about British horror, they get it & I wish Hollywood would pick up on that.

It was like - could NO ONE put the clues together on this one and figure it out before people started dropping like flies?

As in several productions I'd recently seen, the movie starts towards the end (you find out later) and then jumps to the beginning.  This leaves you with absolutely no idea of who anyone is or their relative importance to the plot.  Kinda like ""Firefly"" as broadcast on TV.

The protagonists are out in the woods, at the wrong place because of a stupid manager (and let's face it, we've all worked for stupid managers, right?) and something is horribly wrong.

And it goes down hill from there.

The best bit of comedy is when the last two people are barely standing and then rescued by the two European ""Escorts"" who were at the RIGHT place all along.

A friend who hates horror movies saw this at the Telluride Festival and loved it. She wasn't wrong: It's the kind of movie that's played at both film-snob festivals and exploitation houses because it's such a well done and loving homage to/parody of the kind of  B-movie slasher flicks you used to only be able to see either at the drive-in or on 42nd St.

I class it with ""Tucker and Dale,"" which others here disagree with. But they're both witty, shocking, well written and well acted (c'mon, it's Toby Stephens). And they both have their tongues firmly in cheek.

One last note: Comedy and horror are antithetical. They both rely on surprise, but in radically different ways. You think it's easy to combine the two? Go ahead, give it a try. Which is why it fails so often and it's so unexpected and welcome when someone pulls it off.",1407628800,,935,4.4186046511627906

2887631,3,B000SM6FM2,"Severance (Christopher Smith, 2006)

Well, let's start out at the obvious starting-out point: Christopher Smith directs Danny Dyer. Obviously this isn't enough to look a a movie and say ""this is going to be a classic."" (And, spoiler alert: it isn't.) But you've got Christopher Smith, whose specialty is taking tired old storylines and injecting them with new life, attacking the horror/comedy slasher film. What's not to like? Even better, he got Danny Dyer to be in it (and Danny Dyer's career in horror comedies got very, very busy after this). So you've already got a strong point before you start the movie.

The plot is fairly simple (and, as with all Christopher Smith outings, you've seen it before): a busload of corporate hacks are on their way to a country lodge for one of those team-building exercises. Something goes horribly wrong, they get off track, and end up wandering through the woods until they hit on what their manager believes to be the right lodge, creepy-looking and abandoned as it is... and eventually they realize that their resting place is not nearly as secluded as they think.

As it's a Christopher Smith movie, you can bank on a few things. The script is going to contain all kinds of touches of humor that you might miss if you're not paying attention (the bit with Danny Dyer and the tooth is hilarious), the twist ending is going to be loaded with irony, the cast is going to turn in excellent performances (in some cases the best in their careers). All of these things are true of Severance, and yet I found myself not liking it quite as much as I liked Black Death or Creep.  I can't quite tell you why this is. Maybe because I'm so much more familiar with the genre, or maybe because this genre's been trod so many times that, let's face it, there's not a great deal Smith could do to revitalize it? (To be fair, while the big ironic twist is kind of predictable, it's still funny as hell, in a grim sort of way.) And I certainly don't mean to imply that I didn't like the thing, or that it's not a fun, watchable, addition to the Christopher Smith canon, because I did enjoy it, and if I were to stumble upon it while flipping channels at a friend's house some night it's something I would stick around and catch the end of again. But it doesn't quite seem up to the standard Smith has set in his other movies. ***",1371254400,,2356,4.497663551401869
2887632,4,B000SM6FM2,"I went into this expecting a generic/cliche slasher flick - group goes into the woods, stereotypical stoner, jock, hot chick, geeks, ahole boss, etc.

It does that and then gives them their own somewhat bizarre and overdone personalities, such as the boss's attempt to be PC.

Rarely does a movie successfully combine horror and comedy, there were definitely some tongue in cheek moments here.  Maybe no side-splitting laughter to be found, but I'd say it was darkly twisted and I laughed several times throughout.

I'd say it closely resembled 'Cabin in the Woods', if you enjoyed that movie, you might appreciate this one.

If you're looking for gory torture/porn, look elsewhere.  This has some gore to it, but it isn't Saw or Hostel.  I'd say this movie conentrates more on the humor than the horror and does it well.",1360454400,5,821,4.863309352517986

Half of the film is a great comedy/black comedy spoof on the ""Torture Porn"" sub-genre, & the other half, a dead serious, white knuckled affair! Especially the last third of the film!

A group of employees go out together for a weekend of fun & management improvement skills, but they get more than just fun, & learn how to manage to survive. We have the inept manager, the bookworm woman in glasses, the stoner guy, the black guy, the arrogant, sarcastic, good looking white corporate yuppie guy, the, I get along with everyone guy, & the out of character intelligent & resourceful good looking blonde. Their all going out to spend a weekend in the European redneck equivalent of the S.E. United States, Central Europe, Romania, where the seed of evil torture porn lies!

""Severance is filled with great acting, especially the inept manager, & much kudus goes to the good looking blonde in the strong character role. She's an actress to watch! The others are no slouches either. The stoner is particularly funny & cowardly, as they usually are, but finds courage. The director has to be commended for making what should've of been just another forgettable everyone getting massacred film, into a classic of giggles & thrills! The script is sharp, intelligent, & witty, & the actors all make it come to fruition! You got to love the ending, as it looks like something straight out of a Quinton Taratino film. As a matter of fact, if Taratino was to make a semi spoof/serious torture porn flick, it would be a lot like ""Severance."" You could also throw in the English version of Quinton Tarantino, director, Guy Ritchie.

2887637,4,B000SM6FM2,"Employees of an arms manufacturing company on a corporate retreat somewhere in eastern Europe, run into some heavy duty trouble, in director Christopher Smith's (Black Death, Triangle) Severance (2006), a dark horror comedy with some quirky likeable characters and brutal kills, that puts a different spin on the typical terror in the woods tale.

The executives in the sales division of Palisade Defence are aboard a bus, on their way to a lodge in the woods, for a bit of corporate team building, when their driver runs out on them.  Led by their uptight manager Richard (Tim McInnerny), the team locates what they believe is the lodge.  During the night, Jill (Claudie Blakely) is frightened by a figure she sees in the woods.  The following day, Jill and Harris (Toby Stephens) leave to try and call for help, while the rest of the team engages in a little paintball warfare.  Unfortunately both groups discover that there is great danger in the woods, as Gordon (Andy Nyman) steps into some major trouble, and the bus driver is found dead.  The group attempts to escape in the bus, but only disaster awaits them.

Severance is generally well-written, incorporating humor that often comes from some twisted angle.  The film moves at a brisk pace, and benefits from a talented ensemble cast that does a terrific job with the material.  It effectively builds a connection with the characters, giving you an idea of who they are.  Eventually emerging as the leads, Andy Dyer and Laura Harris give some rock solid performances, including some rugged action scenes.  As the drug abusing Steve, the gangly Dyer seems like an unlikely hero.

The threat from what appear to be renegade Russian soldiers isn't really explained.  Fortunately for the Palisade group, the soldiers do not make a direct attack, and seem to be toying with the visitors, taking out the most helpless first.  Perhaps discipline is a little lax after being in the woods for so long, as the civilians give these soldiers all they can handle.  The level of action picks up nicely near the end, as Maggie (Harris) is dodging a flame thrower and in some need of assistance.

For those who appreciate the terror in the woods genre, Severance is a bloody good time, offering a welcome change of pace, with some fairly sensible adult characters, a dark British sense of humor, tense edgy scares, and gritty action with a variety of violence.  The DVD has a solid complement of extras, including deleted scenes, some making of featurettes, and a ""boys having fun"" type commentary with Christopher Smith, Danny Dyer, Tim McInnerny, and others in the cast.",1315180800,3,2616,4.882352941176471
2887638,2,B000SM6FM2,"SEVERANCE is exactly what you think it is, a mindless slasher film, and not a very good one at that. The plot is dull and extraordinarily linear. It goes something like this: a group of employees decide to travel to a remote section of the woods for a weekend company retreat. On the way to the retreat, the path is blocked by a fallen tree and the driver refuses to travel down the ""other"" path because it is ""dangerous."" The one in charge of the retreat ignores the warning and leads the group down the path to an abandoned lodge/insane asylum. Everything here moves at a pretty molasses-like pace, mind you. On the night of their arrival, three members take turns telling stories that focus on the origins of the lodge/insane asylum at which they are staying. They do a bunch of boring team-building exercises and then the killing begins.

If this film deserves commendation, it's for taking its sweet time. Films like PSYCHO did it right, by waiting a full hour before introducing any sort of violence and SEVERANCE does a similar thing, waiting a full hour before showing us any real gore but it's such a disappointment! Also, don't expect to be impressed by anything about this movie. When you realize who the killer is, it's a very ""oh,"" moment, which left me wondering why the writer/director decided to end the way he did. And let me tell you, the ending is very bizarre, in an awful way. The great thing is that the movie only lasts about 90 minutes but a sizeable chunk of the film could have been cut and still, it would have been a huge disappointment. It also tries to be funny. It's not. Could/should have been a straight-to-tv movie. Rent only!",1312934400,,1660,4.570469798657718

Review:
Christopher Smith is a talented director. He is very good at building suspense, and he appears to be a real actor's director, managing to draw excellent performances from his casts. Severance is part dark comedy, part real live suspense thriller. The script is well-written, the ensemble cast has excellent chemistry, and each of the characters is clearly distinguishable from the others - no interchangeable cardboard cutouts here. The movie is more humorous in the beginning and middle, but the intensity builds the way you would hope it would in an action thriller. (Side note: Check out Triangle and Black Death as well, as they are also very good Smith films. Creep has high production values and some good suspense, but, unlike Smith's other movies, the characters do things that are dumb enough to ruin the film.)",1309996800,2,1292,5.037383177570093

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Well-made horror comedies are a rare find. When I say well-made, I don't mean that there aren't quite a few horror movies out there that have giddily funny moments. Movies like The Toxic Avenger may blur the line, but they rely more on camp than a purer comedic element. I think it has to do with believability. There are some horror movies that find comedy in how a normal person would react to an abnormal situation. Shaun of the Dead excelled in this to a great length. Scenes such as his zombified step-father going crazy until he could turn off the radio are classic in my eyes. Although in the movie the zombies may not be too believable, Shaun's obliviousness to the situation, and finally his reaction, seem plausible, and only minorly exaggerated at times.

  Enter Severance. The movie works much like Shaun of the Dead, and this is without reading other reviews which say the same damn thing without explaining why. It's true. The oblivious nature of the corporate employees of international weapons creator Palisade Defence is shown at the beginning, while they are all on a bus heading to their supposed safe destination at a ""luxury lodge."" It's a believable premise, complete with a tight-lipped staff manager(played by Tim McInnerny), a stoned-out techie(played by Danny Dyer), an anti-war hippie-type(played by Claudie Blakly), and a loveable, fat goon(played by Andy Nyman), among the rest of a stellar cast.

  When their bus driver kicks them off the bus in front of a road not entirely on the beaten path, the crew decide to walk in the hope of finding their destination. What they find is a run-down building that could only be the corporate lodge if their company were instigating this trip during these economic times. While exploring, they come upon paperwork linking their company to Russian military activity and soldier dossiers. With this information they concoct elaborate camp-fire like tales of what went on in the building, the most comical belonging to Danny Dyer.

  After the sighting of a peeping tom at a window, in the middle of this supposedly lifeless forest, the gang investigates a way to get the hell back to civilization, and are instead attacked by human-sized pygmies with guns, and fun times are had by all.

  Some of the great scenes in this movie, without giving too much away:

-human meat pies

-a happy anecdote about human heads remaining conscious for a time after being severed from their body, with a morbid punch-line

-a rocket launcher gone awry

-Danny Dyer saying, ""This is gonna hurt.""

Written by James Moran & Christopher Smith

Any intelligent person forced to take part in an office team-building exercise knows how easy it would be to slip from controlled corporate rage to homicide. The creators of Severance understand that feeling. In place of traditional slasher film targets (such as obnoxious teenagers) they have substituted the people we most want to see mutilated and murdered: co-workers.

When their bus breaks down somewhere in an Eastern European forest, several sales employees of the multi-national Palisade Defence have to schlep their belongings to the nearest hotel. There they await instructions from the American executive who planned their trip. The hotel turns out to be a moldy inn equipped with no amenities except weird pie. And every step outside the place lands the unhappy employees in (often excruciating) peril.

Acting Talent
Thanks to a terrific cast that includes Laura Harris, Danny Dyer, and Tim McInnerny (Lord Percy Percy and Capt. Darling of Blackadder fame) there is no need for over-the-top special effects. Don't get me wrong; what is here is truly horrific. But the point of view makes it so. For example, there's a scene in which a character sees something that gets his feet moving a lot faster--only we don't see what he sees. We see the sheer, animal terror in his eyes, and this is just as effective as anything the props department could have dreamed up.

Plausibility
While some horror filmmakers court plausibility with computer graphics, Christopher Smith makes the bolder and more disturbing choice to go natural. All the stunts and threats come from realistic or believable objects, relations, and circumstances. The style works; it hurts to watch.

Wit
A couple of the best jokes in this film are a long time coming. Yet they're set up so expertly, you recognize every punch line the second it arrives.

Story
You'll spend about half the film trying to figure out if the force preying on our busload of working stiffs is supernatural, psychological, or real. When you finally know, the answer is satisfying in so many ways. All the pieces fit together as snugly as a perfect jigsaw puzzle.

Break out the good wine, and screen this one with smart friends you want to impress and terrify.",1252627200,2,2289,5.007894736842105
2887650,3,B000SM6FM2,"I wish that we could give half stars when rating films because it would make life so much easier. Some films just fall into that netherland in between a 3 and a 4 and SEVERANCE is one of them. It isn't the laff riot that I expected but it does offer moments of dark humor though not as much as I had been led to believe. In fact it has one very clever sequence based on the silent version of NOSFERATU that was one of the best things I've seen in years--unfortunately the film makers couldn't sustain that level of creativity for the entire 90 minute running time. There were other things I admired, to be sure. Such as some of the surprises they pulled out of their bag in relation to the identity of the killer. I liked the fact that there was no solid background for him, that all we know is what the characters gave us themselves as they sat around the table telling different stories they had heard in the past.

SEVERANCE isn't exactly a carnage fest either. There is gore aplenty but if you're looking for eviscerations you aren't going to find them here. And those of you looking for nudity are going to have to wait until the last few minutes to see four breasts. The plot concerns a group of Brits employed by a weapons manufacturer. They are on corporate retreat in Rumania or some such place when their bus breaks down, their driver deserts them,and they decide to hike to what they presume to be their lodge. Wrong. It is in fact the lair of the usual demented serial killer. Violence ensues. Fortunately I could care less about that but it would take too much effort. SEVERANCE is an okay rental. You might even get a kick out of it.",1249603200,3,1647,4.347402597402597
2887651,3,B000SM6FM2,"Severance (2004) When an office sales staff for a British weapons manufacturer goes on a team building weekend during a sales tour of the Balkans, things go wrong quickly and hugely as they go from being lost from their bus, to finding themselves taking refuge in an abandoned lodge that is a far cry from the luxury lodgings promised, to worst of all, someone bumping them off one by one! Starting off as a satire of British office politics (like the British version of The Office) we move a little bumpily to a stylistic cousin to the torture porn movies of late. It's not a full on example of TP because the onscreen gore is not as extensively presented, but it's definitely related with travel to the Balkans region resulting in traps and murder from a mysterious figure. From here, though, the genrebending is a bit strained, as the filmmakers present a full on horror movie spotted with a stream of silly moments. Strangely, though this makes the movie at best watchable, everything I read prior to watching the movie indicated it's a small gem. Not so much. In addition to the horror/humor blending not working well, there are some script problems, especially in the area of whodunit and why. Still in all, the movie is watchable, and might be a decent option for those who like horror movies but shy away from the gore. The cast is fun, with clueless office manager Tim McInnerny (Blackadder) and office sales shark Toby Stephens (Die Another Day) standing out. So not an unqualified success, but worth a look for those so inclined.",1249171200,,1540,4.707407407407407
2887652,5,B000SM6FM2,"Sometimes you just want to watch a movie that entertains you. You want to, in that hour or so, be transported to a plane of existence in which you laugh, cry, cringe or sigh. Horror movies aren't supposed to be great works in which you must be cerebrally challenged or in which you expect total originality. Every once and awhile one will come along that defines a new level of thinking, but for the most part you know you are going to get a formula that works.  A movie called ""Severance"" promises a lot of cuts, and in more ways than one.
The set up is this; some employees of a company called Palisades (who manufactures weapons) are sent into the woods of eastern Europe There they are to meet up with their boss George at a luxury cabin and do team building exercises. Sounds simple enough, albeit every persons nightmare to have to blow a weekend falling into someone's arms and staring at the faces you try so hard to get away from on your time off!! Having been dropped off my a non English speaking bus driver, they must now hoof it to the cabin which may or may not be 1 mile to 10 miles depending on what your definition of an inch is on a map.
Getting to this cabin they all realize, except for their fearless manager and his peppy assistant who has brought everything you could ever need in his bag , that they are not where they need to be and from there this turns into a gory, fun fest that should be mandatory viewing at any company retreat! Are they being hunted and by whom? Is it because of where they work or is it random? Who is getting ""cut"" next, and who will be the last coworker standing? All I know is that it was truly the best teambuilding exercise they could have hoped for and it didn't include playing charades or making bubble graphs. Some people have compared it to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>&nbsp;because of its dry humor and comical death scenes.

2887653,4,B000SM6FM2,"Many times have I passed over the movie Severance, but today I bit.  I had just watched the rather lame 2008 horror movie P2 (""a new level of terror"" - not) and wanted to watch something good.  Given the positive reviews of Severance, I popped it into my Wal-Mart DVD player with confidence.  A few minutes into the movie, I knew I'd like it; by the ten-minute mark, it had evoked laughter and also given me the heebie jeebies (well - moderately heebie, anyway).

The cover says, ""`The Office' meets `The Hills Have Eyes'... it's good, gory fun...""  Well, good -- I am among the fierce Office loyalists, first BBC then American; and Hills was a relatively good slasher flick.  A Severance movie poster describes the farce as, ""A horror comedy for fans of `Shaun of the Dead' and `An American Werewolf in London'."" Being a fan of both, I knew I held a winning pre-owned DVD for my malignant collection.

It's fun when a movie gets you thinking.  Right around the time the paintball action began, there was a brief debate about the relatively humane nature of decapitation.  The fellow claims that it's ""a 100% biological fact"" that a severed head remains conscious for up to a minute after separation from the body.  Naturally, I had to get a second opinion, and a quick Googling led me to StraightDope.com's comments - found in the ""Classics"" section -- on the issue of a decapitated head's being conscious and aware. Indeed, a lone human head seems to have its wits about it for at least 20 seconds after chopping/lopping.  How interesting!  (BTW, if you want to know more - and who wouldn't - there are some very interesting anecdotes about this question, and this horrorphile - initially a 'conscious head' skeptic - was converted.)

The group sat around a table at the ""luxury lodge"" eating dessert when one of the group found someone else's tooth in his mouthful of warm pie.  The fellow who'd served everyone the dish assumed the dish was safe to eat (even though he had merely found the pie in the fridge and not prepared it) merely because it was wrapped in foil.  There's hilarity aplenty to be found here. Bonus: The lead female is easy on the eyes.",1241568000,2,2159,4.615183246073299
2887654,5,B000SM6FM2,"When this DVD first came out I was tempted to buy it but kept changing my mind as the past couple of comedy horrors I watched were really bad and, in my opinion, it is very difficult to make a good comedy horror because you need to know just the right ammount of comedy to add into the mix to make the movie funny - but not so much that it totally kills the horror and suspense elements of the movie. However, several weeks after this movie first came out, I eventually decided to take a chance on it. And I could've kicked myself...for not buying this movie earlier that is!

Severance manages to successfully combine comedy and horror in a way that really works and allows this movie to be really funny in parts but also allows there to be suspense - and even some moments that are downright frightening! Also, some of the humourous aspects of the movie make good charactor development and make the charactors (particularly to two leads, played by Laura Harris and Danny Dyer) very likeable and realistic.

The plot is that a group of office workers are sent on a team building exercise in the woods. They are deserted by their bus driver in the middle of nowhere and eventually manage to find their cabin...but this turns out to be the least of their worries as they are being gruesomely killed one-by-one by a killer, or killers, with a grudge against them.

As well as being an excellent movies, this DVD comes packed with extras, all of which are good and definatly deserve a look.

Severance is a far above average comedy horror/slasher movie that I would highly recommend.",1237420800,,1580,4.533333333333333
2887655,5,B000SM6FM2,"Easily one of the better horror movies I've seen in a while. I thought it had an excellent mix of comedy and gore and both were well-timed. The first half is all about the chuckles, whereas the second half was focusing on getting nasty. I don't get easily scared at films, but Severance made me jump more than most I've seen. The film is also very clever. For example, at one part the scary music starts to get louder and Harris (Toby Stephens) turns round in the usual ""there's something behind you"" way, and the sound of a knife sharpening is heard. But then it quickly changes to the next scene where it shows another character sharpening a knife to cut some cheese. I've never seen this technique used in a movie before, but it works so well. Getting you tense and ready for something to happen and then nothing happens. Thus the viewer relax only to be scared by a quick scary moment that follows. It's like a mind trick. The deaths are great, ranging from machete to bear trap, sliced stomach to flamethrower. The ending is great and fits the movie well. Also, the killers aren't superhuman. They are realistic, everyday psychopaths that are trying to kill a group of people. So it doesn't take a full clip of white hot lead to take one out, all it takes is a smack to the head with a rock. Overall a great film that is must see for horror fans or lovers of pitch-black comedies. If you are a fan of horror/violence mixed in with some coarse humor (think Shaun of the Dead, The Cottage) then this movie is for you!",1226793600,,1520,4.3936170212765955
2887656,2,B000SM6FM2,"For a movie billed as a combination of Office Space and Hostel, where Brits attempt to capitalize on the horror/comedy genre of Shaun of the Dead, it's disappointing.  Considering it's a story bereft of humor, one would think this movie would rely on horror strength.  The only time I was mortified was when I realized it wasn't a zombie movie, and the actors were just that stiff.  It felt like a tired horror movie where nothing but clichs are followed.

Why does every generic horror movie have to start off with dimwits running aimlessly through a dark forest?  Why do they always fall?  When these idiots are murdered, isn't it just Darwin taking care of business?  The movie starts out in such a way as to cause me to ask these questions.  Three people running, all three get trapped, one who looks like a William Shatner clone gets gashed and his guts flow.

The guts of the story, however, is about a team of weapons dealers - without weapons - in Eastern Europe on a team-building weekend.  They're the same brain-dead characters making the same perpetual mistakes.  Yuppies in a rural environment, wow, how original.  Naturally, their bus driver gets angry and leaves them.  Good job; get rid of your interpreter.  They hear strange noises; so, they begin walking into the forest towards the noises.  That's always smart.  They finally arrive at their cabin retreat, which looks like garbage - turns out it's an abandoned insane asylum.  Of course it is.  As part of their activities they tell stories they have heard about a place like the one in which they are staying.  The stories are unimportant except for the fact they serve as the weak device to advance a moronic plot.  They eat a meat-pie with a human tooth in it (insert British dentistry joke here).  There is yet another moron who steps in a bear trap.  Oops.  There's the typical decapitated head rolling on the ground and seeing its own body scene.  Wait, what?  Ok, so maybe it's not all unoriginal.

The shining moment of this movie is a brilliant homage to the Nosferatu-era of silent cinema.  Stop motion movement, long fingernails, simple yet ominous makeup, wonderful usage of shadows, it's all there.  When the brief interlude ends, the remaining wind left in the movie's already sagging sails dissipates.

For what it's worth, if I saw it listed on TV one night, I'd skip it for a Jeopardy repeat.",1224374400,3,2380,4.7226277372262775

Before viewing Severance, it appeared as if it were a Brit-fueled comedy/slasher in the vein of Shaun of the Dead.  While this wasn't necessarily the case, Severance does provide a few good laughs, but the film is actually more along the lines of the traditional slasher flick.  Severance revolves around a group of sales divison drones (including David Dyer, Laura Harris, Die Another Day's Toby Stephens, and Blackadder vet Tim McInnerny) who are taken to the Eastern European mountains for the weekend, only to end up getting picked off in some very bloody ways.  Without giving too much away, the body count and blood start to mount as the office crew find themselves hunted down in some pretty brutal ways.  Seriously, Severance provides a good amount of blood and gore, but lacks in the suspense department, and ends up being pretty predictable.

""Severance"" is apparently Britain's answer to the ""Friday the 13th"" movies (as if such a response were even needed).  Seven employees - ironically enough of an arms-manufacturing firm - head off to the forests of Eastern Europe (the new locale-of-choice for the modern horror film, it would appear) for a weekend of corporate-sponsored team-building and morale-boosting.  Their adventure turns into a nightmare, however, as the members of the party are hunted down and brutally murdered by a mask-wearing, weapons-wielding serial killer with serious developmental issues.  Meat cleavers, serrated knives, blow torches, machine guns - no tool is too crude or too sophisticated for our intrepid little psychopath to employ in the course of his business.  This is supposed to make him a sort of homegrown version of the company people he`s killing, I suppose, but the movie is frankly too dumbed-down and lunk-headed for such heavy-handed ironies to register much of an impact.

Though it is efficiently executed and reasonably well acted, ""Severance"" doesn't bring anything new to a genre whose modus operandi was pretty much set in stone once ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" laid down the original blueprint thirty some odd years ago.  As with most such films, the majority of the thrills come in the earlier sequences before the nature of the threat has been fully revealed.  Once that occurs, however, the movie devolves into yet another monotonous gore-fest, with only a trace of that trademark British cheekiness to distinguish it from the countless other slasher movies that have come before it.  When all is said and done, the only thing more objectionable than the sadism and gore is the shocking lack of originality and imagination that all concerned have brought to the enterprise.",1212796800,2,1794,5.2229965156794425

And suspense mounts, as you see these likeable characters moving deeper and deeper into danger.

Not a bad combo at all, if you ask me.
Here's the premise:
A group of office employees(all of which are great characters), on a retreat, happen upon the wrong cabin.
And by wrong, I mean, home of a psychopath.
So what naturally starts out as whole-hearted laughs, quickly distorts into blood-curdling screams.

Needless to say,
I am so glad I stumbled upon this gem of a horror/comedy.
So freakin' glad.
I found it infinitely more hilarious than Shaun of the Dead AND Black Sheep.
In fact I found it funnier than practically every horror/comedy I've ever seen.
Very highly recommended.
(Especially to those who like to laugh & cringe)
One of the most lovable characters in the picture is trippin' out on mushrooms the entire film. =D
And during this one particular scene,
he sees himself standing in the threshold across the room,
So of course, his duplicate and him start making facial gestures to each other.
Eventually he follows his doppleganger outside,
and sees yet another duplicate standing against a tree,
who it turns out, was him the entire time.

And yet despite all the comedy that takes place in the former half of the film,
there is definitely an impending sense of dread in the latter half,
especially once the blood starts soaking up the surroundings.
And truth be told, the gore is actually done suprisingly well.
No cop outs here, folks.
There's 1 inevitabely classic scene where one characters leg is stuck in a bear-trap.
His fellow employees keep trying to help him out, but to no avail.
It keeps slamming shut, biting down even further into his leg.
And as sorry as I am to admit this,
I just kept laughing harder and harder with each unsuccessful attempt.

Words canot decribe how excited I am to have found this bright little gem.
From begining to end this one has ""sleeper hit"" written all over it.

you realize you're just at the tip of the ice-berg.

With the exception of one killing, in the opening scene, it takes about an hour (in a 90 minute movie) for the villains to arrive. Once they do arrive, the film degenates into torture-porn.

If this was going to be a slasher film, the real violence should have started a lot sooner--halfway into the film is a little too late and the buildup for 45 minutes just wears you down.  On the other hand, there are some fairly funny places in the film.  Hilarious?  Not really.  From what others had told me, that's what I'd expected and was sorely disappointed only to have chuckled in a couple of places.

I'd rent this one--on a cheap day.  See if you like it, then buy it.",1192579200,,737,4.564885496183206
2887670,1,B000SM6FM2,"This is a case of misleading quotes on a cover.  I was expecting something along the lines of Shaun of the Dead, or Peter Jackson's Gore-opus ""Dead Alive"", instead I got a British Friday the 13th, more or less.

Gore?  What gore?  Maybe I've been desensitized but there wasn't anything too flinch inducing in this movie.  I just watched Scarecrows about 2 days ago and THAT had more gore in it than this, and it was a far superior movie as well.

Laura Harris was, as always, incredibly hot, but she couldn't save this boring, predictable, unfunny waste of 90 some minutes.",1191283200,,573,4.568627450980392
2887671,5,B000SM6FM2,"I had to round up on ""Severance"" simply because it has one of the funniest scenes in a horror movie that I have ever seen.  I told my wife about it (she would scarcely condescend to watch a movie like this), and she even laughed out loud at my simple description of the scene in question.  ""Severance"" is one of those movies where you want to work out the math to figure out the bits and pieces you see director Christopher Smith and his screenwriting partner James Moran mixing up in this 2006 film.  Basically take the gang from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office/dp/B000SINT4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office</a>,"" have them sell weapons instead of paper like in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-War/dp/B000BYA5GO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of War</a>,"" put them deep in the woods like whatever your favorite deep in the woods horror film might be (e.g., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>"" if you are under 30, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deliverance/dp/B000RTB0R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deliverance</a>"" if you are over), and do ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Most-Dangerous-Game/dp/B00006SFJB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Most Dangerous Game</a>"" bit.  I know it seems like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>"" would be an obvious comparison for a movie like this that wants to blend horror and comedy, but ""Severance"" is going to suffer in that sort of comparison.  However, compare it to your standard horror film (which more often than not is direct to video these days), and this one looks pretty good.

So go along with the idea that sending the sales team for a munitions maker to a lodge somewhere in Eastern Europe for team building exercises.  The team leader (Tim McInnerny) is not a leader, but then he does not really have a team.  Laura Harris from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Like-Me/dp/B00094ARGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Like Me</a>"" is the most recognizable face and clearly not a dumb blonde, so you expect here to be around at the end.  The rest of them are you regular smorgasbord of future dead meat, from the pothead (Danny Dyer) and the brown-noser (Andy Nyman) to the minority person (Babou Ceesay) and the brunette with the glasses (Claudie Blakley).  The setting is Hungary and after the war in Bosnia and torture-porn films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>"" there is a real sense that Eastern Europe is basically a giant death trap (but a cheap place to make movies).  Where once there were Nazis and then psychotic Vietnam Vets, now there are thugs from Eastern Europe as the villains du jour.  At least this time around randomness is not a part of the equation, although that particular plotline is raised late and not exploit for anything remotely like what it would be worth.

The slightly askew tone of the film is set early on when the standard scene of two buxom blondes running screaming through a forest is juxtaposed with classical music well suited to a ballet, and continues right through the end credits, where we get a different version of the same song that gets played at the end of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Strangelove-or-How-I-Learned-to-Stop-Worrying-and-Love-the-Bomb/dp/B000055Y0X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</a>.""  It was nice for once to see people with college degrees being killed off one by one after all those countless dead teenager movies that have always made up most of the horror genre.  Their occupation also comes into play in a couple of key ways, not only because of the idea that such merchants of death deserve to die horrible deaths, but also because these people know about weapons (now they just have to survive long enough to get their hands on some and use them).  ""Severance"" is not always successful in trying to have it both way and even if the sick humor is makes for the films most memorable moments there are a few chilling bits as well (it helps that Harris plays it from start to finish like she is in a horror film).  This was the most entertaining horror film I have seen in some time, which may not mean much given the dreck I have watched this past summer, but from my vantage point looks like the top of the mole hill.",1190851200,4,4830,5.997093023255814
2887672,2,B000SM6FM2,"""Severance"" disappointed me. In my opinion, it is neither especially funny nor suspenseful. A 90-minute slasher movie should not take 45 minutes for the slashing to begin. The characters were two dimensional (uptight boss, stoner, brownnose, hot American) and the film did not make me care for any of them. The villains were forgettable and without a gimmick, and their backstory as either escaped loonies or soldiers who were experimented on was weak and unoriginal. If I had made this movie, I would have made the bad guys a group also on a team building exercise--only their exercise is to kill a bunch of people.",1190592000,,616,4.876190476190477

8205976,5,B000SM6FM2,"This is a proper dark comedy. Unlike most slasher flicks they take their time to build up some semblance of interest in the characters so that when the violence begins we can actually feel abit bad for them rather then cheer on the killers like in typical horror camp movies.

This is in part helped by a few solid actors. We have Capt Flint from Black Sails and Daisy the reaper from Dead Like Me. In fact when blondie grabs the machete that is what I imagined in a text bubble above her head, Frell this I was a reaper its they who should be afraid.
