I made most of the corpses and gore stuff with my friend Lance beard. horrifically bad acting, just like the others have said. But I have to say it was fun making it for about 20 grand (i heard). We had a haunted house volunteer production company at the time in college and Eric decided he was going to make a movie using the props we had at the time.

Wow, horrible, fun times. The reason we all stayed late in college!

The film was made in my hometown and the headline in our local paper stated the following at that time: ""Local Film Cinematic Nightmare"". So much for civic pride!
With cardboard acting, cheesy set design and cinematography that is so sub standard it makes John Russo look like Orson Welles,this feature was destined for the scrap heap (or at the very least the coveted 4:45am slot on Drive-in theater).
If you like this one seek out ""Alex's Apartment"" for further reaearch into the local ""cinema subbasement"". Thank god for DVD!",1064880000,,672,4.516393442622951

It was a movie wandering amlessly throughout where ever bad movies  go.  Movie heaven maybe, but unfortunatly Dark Carnival probally went to  movie hell.  I love cheesey horror flicks, but this was down right a waste  of time.  Rent if you are curious, but don't throw away your cash on such a  bad flick.",955065600,2,460,4.445783132530121
