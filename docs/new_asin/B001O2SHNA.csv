8328939,4,B001O2SHNA,"Good movie. Entertaining and interesting. I enjoyed the movie. It will probably never win an oscar but it was nice to watch. The main reason I bought this movie is because on Saturday, June 5, 2004 they filmed the court scene in Leesburg, VA and then the scene with the court reporters as they were leaving the court room. I played an extra in the movie. If you look closely you will see my beautiful watch and I do get about 10 seconds of air time cut over four turns to the reporters. It was interesting and fun to watch them film the scenes and be a part of a movie.",1275264000,,569,4.135135135135135
8328940,5,B001O2SHNA,"What a great independent thriller this is.  If you like crime drama, if you like movies like ""The Usual Suspects"", and if you value story, plot, and concept with good acting above things like having recognizable stars, then you'll love this film.",1265846400,,246,4.857142857142857
8328941,5,B001O2SHNA,"Standalone is an original and creative film, ala Seven, Usual Suspects and Reservoir Dogs.  It established the storyline early and picks up speed throughout the film, culminating with a bang at the end.  I highly recommend it.",1231113600,,226,5.081081081081081
