8144486,5,B000I8OOJM,I watched this movie being made in Lockford. It was very interesting so I bought the dvd.,1509408000,,89,4.294117647058823
8144487,4,B000I8OOJM,"I like Buck Taylor having personally met him when he came to Lovington, New Mexico for the Rodeo.  He came with ""Sam"" of Gunsmoke and they were both very personable guys.  No pretenses.  I also saw him again when he appeared on Red Steagall's Somewhere West of WallStreet TV show on RFDtv.  That is how I heard about the show.  It was good and I don't regret purchasing it.  I can recommend it to those who are not looking for graphics and music so loud that it covers up the dialogue.",1500508800,,485,4.274725274725275
8144488,5,B000I8OOJM,"I have been a longtime fan of Buck Taylor.  The interactions of his character and that of the young girl playing his granddaughter were touching.  He learning to have someone in his life and her learning his ways.  I cried through parts, but loved the movie.",1453507200,,258,4.565217391304348

8144490,5,B000I8OOJM,"I saw this movie for the first time in film school and man what a movie, I loved it can't say enough about what a great movie it is. This movie is a definite must see and Buck Taylor and Samantha Droke do a great job in bringing out the flavor of the movie. This movie is really worth watching.",1306627200,,294,3.9166666666666665
8144491,5,B000I8OOJM,"One of the FINEST modern American westerns I seen.  Buck Taylor is simply amazing as the aging rancher who sees his entire world disappearing faster than his ranch dirt blowing away in the wind. If you've ever been in ol' Harry's boots then you know what I mean.  Most folks miss the point of this quiet little film. It's not the land, the cattle or the ranch that is being lost...It is the VERY SOUL of it's owner. Everything he knows, loves and understands is being replaced by man's modern ""everything is replacable"" attitudes. This film will break your heart and then heal it. Deserves EVERY award that it has won!! Taylor should have an Oscar next to his saddle at home for this impressive simple film.",1233532800,3,707,4.559055118110236
8144492,5,B000I8OOJM,This hauntingly beautiful film of  ranch life so accurately illustrates the frustration of the small Central Valley rancher who has a heartfelt commitment to the land and his way of life.  Anyone even remotely interested in ranch life will be richly rewarded by Buck Taylor's performance...you can feel his  deep love for the land and  his way of life.  How many of his struggles did our fathers  experience?  The gorgeous  images of this film will touch many of us.  I would recommend it to anyone with a love of the earth.,1182297600,4,524,4.670329670329671
8144493,1,B000I8OOJM,"the Cowboy hall of fame got one thing right about this movie: it is a cowboy movie. Other than that, I can not understand how it could have garnered the picture of the year award, as it is absolutely terrible on every front: acting, photography quality, sound quality, dialog, plot continuity, everything. We had to discontinue viewing.",1180051200,,336,4.912280701754386
8144494,5,B000I8OOJM,"Buck Taylor is convincing in his role as Harry Dodds, an aging rancher fighting to hold on to his land, while at the same time struggling to raise his teenage granddaughter.  Fans will remember Buck Taylor from his roles as Newly in Gunsmoke and as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson in Tombstone.  Samantha Droke is a natural in the role of the granddaughter, bringing an innocent charm to her part.  There is a great supporting cast of real-world cowboys, including Barry Tubb, Brad Johnson, and Tommy Guy, all of whom add a sense of authenticity to the film, bringing scenes to life with humor and grit.  Oscar winner George Kennedy has a likeable turn in his role as Dr. Peter Gannon.

  Truce is truly an international collaboration, written and directed by American Matthew Marconi, with cinematography by Takuji Murata of Japan, and musical score written and conducted by Robert Gulya of Hungary.  This is a wonderful film, beautifully shot on cattle ranches in California.  Truce brings to mind the colorful history of ranching in America, along with the quest of the modern rancher to preserve a unique and challenging way of life.  Moreover, this film is a testament to hard work and determination, and ultimately, to forgiveness and the ability of individuals to evolve.",1163721600,9,1272,4.929577464788732
8144495,5,B000I8OOJM,"a total waste of life to own a ranch, feeding some cows, living alone, owing big mortgage, lagging monthly payments, so stubborn to give up. what's the purpose of such life and living? worth it? or you just want to hang on to this hopeless blind belief that you could make it?

like farmers in america, ranchers also struggle so bad that what used to make america strong now becomes a joke. by watching this movie, i also feel so hopeless and helpless like that old rancher on a small piece of land in america. why american government, the congress and the senate didn't do anything for their own people who are struggling so pathetically in their lives? why throw so much money in the so-called foreign aids? why not put money in our own peoples' pockets? if all the congressmen and the senators are elected by their own people in their states, why they just listen and pay attention to those lobbyists? what went wrong with america?",1163462400,,934,4.559523809523809
