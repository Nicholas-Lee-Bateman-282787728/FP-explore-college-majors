Clinton is as guilty as any other crook in Arkansas and 2.) The drug smuggling and gun running by Barry Seal and Dan Lasater from Mena airport was to and from THE DRUG CARTELS, and NOT the Contras. It was YEARS after Seal was gone and Lasater went to prison (pardoned by Clinton after serving only 25% of his sentence)-that the same plane that was years before used for drug smuggling, was used to run supplies to the Contras.",1446508800,,638,4.862385321100917
