8189244,5,B000P6R5TS,"I am a great admirer of this film and feel it ranks with Francis Mankiewitz's masterpiece Les Bons Dbarras (1980) as one of cinema's best treatments of embattled innocence. There is, however, a common misconception about the events presented in CHILD MURDERS that I'd like to address here. Even careful viewers of this marvelously rich story are guilty of misunderstanding how deeply misunderstood the children of 'MURDERS are. Perhaps this is a strength of the film; that it is complex enough in its storytelling that it can't succeed with the same yardstick used for other feature film fare. Caryn James of The New York Times believes, as many viewers are likely to, that the film's child protagonist is a murderer, having taken ""violent action,"" perhaps due to ""some innate immorality."" Like Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, Ms. James, along with the adults depicted in Child Murders, has fallen into something of a narrative trap. Of course, this is a film intended for adults, but it requires very careful consideration to reveal its secrets. (I should warn readers at this point of a 'spoiler,' though I doubt revealing a key plot point in any film could possibly spoil it.) If Zsolt is a murderer, as it superficially appears, then his murderousness would compromise the poignance of a parentless boy raised and assessed (wrongly) by the adult world. This is the world that defines Zsolt, in the manner of a film reviewer, and ultimately breaks him, as depicted in the devastating final scene of the correctional facility talent show. It seems clear to me that the protagonist is a caregiver who yearns for family, in particular a father; a role played, tragically, by the investigator. Closely following the interplay of the boy and the taunting girl, who is under the influence of young love (not unlike the boy), one can see that the girl's death is not a murder, but a product of dejection. In a more baroque sense, the girl's death is a form of murder, stemming from her cruelly effective impersonation of an adult, an impersonation, over a pay phone, designed to hurt the boy she loved but couldn't have. The death of the boy's object of affection (who represents an ideal of mother and playmate), only emphasizes to the girl the terrible turns love can take for adults. When the girl learns of the gypsy's suicide, a revelation not depicted but implied, it suggests the girl's choice of taking her own life, as an expresson of isolation from both the banal familiar and the foreign beloved.",1266883200,,2513,4.873831775700935
