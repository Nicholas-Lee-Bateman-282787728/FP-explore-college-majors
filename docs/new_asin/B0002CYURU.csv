2078109,5,B0002CYURU,This movie was beautifully made.  The characters were intriguing.  This is what independent film making is all about.,1100908800,6,117,5.444444444444445
2078110,1,B0002CYURU,"Imagine if you gave your comic-book-loving, video-game-playing, porn-sneaking 13-year-old nephew eleven million dollars to make a movie with--I suspect ""Hotel"" is pretty much what he'd come up with, if he had blackmail material on people like John Malkovich and Selma Hayek and pointless pretensions to intellectualism.
Mike Figgis apparently eschewed a formal script for this piece o' cra--er, project.  Gee, I would never have guessed!  Maybe that has something to do with the complete absence of any discernible plot.  What it does have is plenty of stupid gimmicks like split-screen viewing and use of infra-red filters.  Ooh!  Like, cool, man, lemme hold that thing!
Here's a tip:  this may be the worst movie Julian Sands has ever appeared in.  The only reason it got one star from me is that Amazon wouldn't let me give it zero.

I am embarrassed for them.  This move is not thrilling, not engaging, not entertaining.  Boring.  Imbecilic.  This film is about as appealing as dog-do on my shoe.  The jacket description is totally misleading.  Thank God I got this one in the bargain box.  $4.00 is still too much to pay for this.

2078113,2,B0002CYURU,"heh...the words on the jacket: ""a deliciously disturbing and erotically charged thriller""... are rather shameless hyperbole.

Instead, this film is remarkable for one thing alone: how the director squanders acting talent and beauty (Salma Hayek, Chiara Mastroianni, Ornella Muti, Lucy Liu!), financial resources, and the luminous backdrop of Venice to produce a film that is not even a flop but rather resembles an uncut first year film student's independent project... a very average project, that is.

The words that come to mind are 'breathless', 'pretentious' and 'incompetent'. Generally, the designation ""art film""  means that the director is unable to focus or use a script and needs to resort to gimmickry. this certainly is true for the Hotel. The 'macabre' we see is simply an excuse for Figgis' lack of imagination; the exquisite Dutchess of Malfi text is abused rather than used. The two good scenes (with John Malkovich, in the beginning; the flamenco scene in the middle) are never developed.

My basic issue with the film is that it is basically soul-less.

This is not due to Figgis' incompetence alone. The film should never have been produced.

Come to think of it, The Hotel should be required viewing for film students, a lesson in how great actors and a lot of money are not enough to make a good flick. There is something else.",1185235200,7,1349,5.0
2078114,5,B0002CYURU,"This movie is simply one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. Yes, it is unconventional but not in some far out, puzzling way like Peter Greenaway's films. Every moment made perfect sense. It is incredibly erotic, funny, and fascinating. It moves like a poem, and I found myself rewinding several times just to watch a scene again and catch the phrasing. This is not Legally Blonde. Your brain will be engaged. Highlights are Salma Hayek's adorably bad singing, Rhys iffans acting like the director from hell, and the absolutely luminous acting of Saffron Burrow's who in my opinion is one of the finest and most underated actresses working today. If you are ever looking for a good film, just look at her filmography -- she has chosen very excellent and difficult films.",1183852800,4,779,4.735294117647059

With this movie, it's not the dialogue, the plot or any other typical production necessaries that pull the viewer into the chaos. Oddly placed comic moments, strange and intriguing situations, erotic overtones, bold subject presentation, and random progression held my attention. Not for the masses, Hotel provides a very unconventional ride. I know NO other film with which to compare this flick. Worth the watch. Just don't go in with expectations. It's weird, but has a pleasantly sinful aftertaste. (The meal at the very beginning with John Malcovich is priceless.)",1177459200,7,705,5.303571428571429

2078118,2,B0002CYURU,"Mike Figgis has previously directed two great movies. ""Leaving Las Vegas""

and ""The Loss of Sexual Innocence"". Even though I browsed past the Amazon reviews and had seen that the movie was not well liked, I decided to risk it and watch it anyway. This is a bad movie. It's that simple...It is truly a piece of s*it. I can't say there is a good thing about it. And it's not just the cinematography that's bothersome. In fact, it was good of Figgis to use this kind of cinematography...Because, believe me. A movie like this would've been ten times worse had it been in your regular, run-of-the-mill cinematography. Now, even though I've just completely blasted this movie; I'm giving it two stars just because, for a while, it was fascinating. I hated the story, but my eyes were glued to the screen for most of it. But, the story is just so stupid, half the time doesn't make any sense. It's pretty much a complete waste of actors talents. The movie's cast is amazing though, it features John Malkovich, David Schwimmer, Rhys Ifans, Lucy Liu, Salma Hayek, Danny Huston, Jason Isaacs, and Burt Reynolds. Much of the dialogue is improvised (which isn't obvious, oddly enough), the actors are waering little to no makeup, and well...How the hell do you even explain this kind of movie? I guess if you were to give it a synopsis, it would be: A group of filmmakers ascend upon an old hotel in Venice, Italy and begin shooting a movie. Not long after, the director (Ifans) is shot and his best friend (Schwimmer) takes on the directing duites. The movie they're making is an adaptation of the play ""The Duchess of Malfi"" and at times, we spend five minutes or more just watching scenes from this. Then people are suddenly finding dead body parts in the meat cellar of the hotel. But does anything come of these findings? No. Could they have cut these scenes and still had a bad movie? Yes. The more I watch movies like this, the more I wonder if critics are paid to steer their views toward something. I mean, Roger Ebert seemed to like this movie; but he doesn't like a movie like ""Serving Sara"" or something. Trust me, folks. This movie should never have been made, will leave no mark upon society or film (except it will leave a nasty mark, on Mike Figgis' previously really good resume'), and I hope Figgis will stick to what he's good at. Good movies, with regular cinematography, that get lots of Oscar nominations.

After the first confusing messy thirty minutes (John Malkovich sitting behind prison bars at a dinner table for no apparent reason other than to offer insipid dialogue to an uncaring dinner guest list), I decided to just look at the screen for the color and the wild camera work.  Venice looks great but the stodgy staging of 'The Duchess of Malfi' and the weak plot associated with it doesn't even begin to cover the creaks in this silly film.

even sat well with the Arthouse crowd.

This movie is obnoxious and strange.
I don't dislike it for that reason
alone. It's uneven, mostly boring, and has
too much dialogue about absolutely nothing.
The cinematography is dizzying (in an annoying
way) and the characters are flat corpses,
even before they're killed.

And where is all the alleged eroticism?
With so much of nothing going on in this
film it would be very easy to miss (However,
the ""Milk"" scene is definitely worthy of
an eyebrow raise).

My biggest surprise is how in the world
did they manage to get so many notable
actors to appear in this horrible film.

2078130,1,B0002CYURU,"At the 2003 NoDance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, director Mike Figgis was honored as a pioneer, a Hollywood somebody who was using Digital Video to create ""groundbreaking"" new cinema. Shown at the festival were his critically-acclaimed ""Timecode,"" and ""Hotel,"" his new DV movie for which he was seeking distribution. In late 2004, when seeing ""Hotel"" for the first time, I realized exactly why it took him so long to secure distribution for it.

To call ""Hotel"" a monstrosity is being too kind. This film exists on a level of bad that is rarely stooped to, even by accident. Many critics will say that Figgis is doing something daring, something rarely attempted by established Hollywood directors. He's taken these little DV cameras, thrown the common Hollywood book of rules away, and ran wild. Breaking the rules is always a great thing to do in order to explore new territory. However, there's a reason that some of those rules exist, and that's to prevent you from making a horrible mistake. ""Hotel"" is a horrible mistake.

THE GOOD:

- Kink. ""Hotel"" has its share of kinky, erotic moments that aren't without merit. For instance, an interesting little breasts-in-glasses-of-milk scene, and an interesting ""let's tie up Valeria Golino and do nasty things to her"" scene.

- Concept. The idea of a group of filmmakers checking into a hotel where guests are killed an eaten has been done before, but is still an interesting idea for a horror film. Unfortunately, ""Hotel"" is not horror, just horrible.

THE BAD:

- Dogme '95. For those of you who don't know, a Dogme film is one which is shot on video, shaky handheld, out in public, with no lighting and, generally, no script. Much of ""Hotel"" is shot in the Dogme style. It's ""Improv Filmmaking."" And I hate it with a passion. Dogme films have become the ""expected."" When someone says ""DV Movie,"" an image is instantly conjured up: shaky handheld that looks awful and has a lot of people running around public places assulting passers-by. And this really upsets me. For filmmakers who shoot on video, but try their darndest to make it ""look good"" by using interesting shot composition and filmic lighting, this DV stereotype makes us look bad. It makes people presume, before watching the movie, that they'll be looking at garbage. And thus, our movies don't get watched, and our movies don't sell. Dogme 95 is exactly the reason that DV filmmaking is disrespected and spat upon by distributors and audiences alike.

- Acting. For the most part, the cast are not improv actors. Indeed, Malkovich and Rhys Ifans can probably pull off any role with their eyelids glued shut, but the remainder of the cast just comes off as whiney wannabees. These people are very good actors... when they have a script. Don't mess with a good thing, people.

- Structure. Indeed, structure is something I don't usually complain about, because it's so subjective. A film can be structured oddly, but still be really well-done. Non-linear stories are often times good, and innovative, and interesting. ""Hotel"" has no structure whatsoever. It merely meanders through its murky subplots and muddy dialogue for its excrutiating 129 minutes, and leaves you thouroghly confused, and not in a good way.

- Pointless Cameos. John Malkovich appears for about 2 minutes, for no reason. Burt Reynolds appears for about 2 minutes, for no reason. This ain't ""The Player,"" Figgis. There's a reason the cutting-room floor exists. Use it.

THE UGLY

- The Look, the Feel of Ugly. There's also a reason that lights exist, Figgis. And that is to make your movie not look like poop. The majority of the film is super-gained-up video that's grainy as hell, and the exclusive use of only available light makes every actor, including the hot ones, look like they just got the crap kicked out of them by Russell Crowe, then were dragged screaming through the streets of Venice, and thrown straight into the endless piles of pigeon dung. He also uses Sony's ""NightShot"" nightvision feature for when he has no light whatsoever. Professional cameras don't have this feature. Why? Because professionals don't use it. Why? Because professionals have lights. Wait... even amateurs have lights. I've seen middle school short films that were easier to look at than ""Hotel.""

THE CONCLUSION

Mike Figgis has thrown away the book of rules. He has dared to tread into new territory. Normally, this sort of behavior is rewarded. But not this time, Figgy. I have respect for those who shoot on DV. I have respect for those who break new ground. But for those of us who shoot on DV, struggle and strife, and hope one day to make a living making movies, you're not doing us any favors.",1111708800,13,4684,4.86198243412798
8026426,2,B0002CYURU,"The 5 star reviews make a few good points and the 1 star reviews make many good points  . . . meaning that a few ideas/moments in the film deserve 5 stars, but many, many more -- most actually -- deserve a 1 star rating.  (BTW, I've almost never encountered anything more hated by Amazon reviewers than this film!  Almost 60% of those who watch this film hate it, and it is NOT because none of us know how to identify 'good film-making' or that we do not understand the cutting-edge creativity of independent film-making.  Please:  cut the 'art film pretentiousness' already).

I would have been generous and given this film 3 stars EXCEPT the light pornography about 30-40 minutes in completely destroyed what little interest the film had generated and caused me to turn it off for good.  I mean, there is so much which is horrible and wrong with this film that it was barely keeping me interested ANYWAY, but then it had to divide into 4-scenes-at-once (4 picture-within-a-picture boxes containing different scenes) with each simultaneously depicting a different scenario of light porn?  No, no, no.  This was supposed to be a horror/mystery film -- or so the back of the DVD case indicated.  If your film is so bad you need to induce lasciviousness in your audience just to  keep them watching, please, next time, just SCRAP THE PROJECT, okay?  My teen sons were watching with me and they don't need to see that crap.  (Note: many parents watch R-rated films with their teens because that's infinitely better than the teen watching alone or with other teens:  a parent can discuss what needs to be discussed about the film as it progresses, as well as decide if, and when, it is time to simply turn the movie off).

One final comment:  how in the hell did this director get so many A list actors to participate in this farce of a film?  Was there even a script?  Were any of the actors given the opportunity, before signing on, to actually READ the script?  Did they give John Malkovich a fake script such that he thought there was actually a real MOVIE with a PLOT attached to his one (interesting, yet bizarre) scene?  Did any of these actors sue after the completed film was released because it was not at all what it had been represented to be, upfront?  Enquiring minds want to know!  (P.S. Since I did not watch the entire film, maybe John Malkovich had more than his one scene at the very beginning . . . but I suspect he did not.)

For those of you who are going to hate on me because of what I said about the 'eroticism' of this film:  true eroticism is something completely different than sex used to manipulate an audience.  A woman dipping her bare breasts into glasses of milk in order to arouse a man is just weird, not erotic.  A woman wearing a miniskirt and no panties who pulls a gun from between her legs (insinuating that she had it up inside her) is crass and gross, not erotic.  Showing disembodied female legs parting to permit the entry of a disembodied hand while simultaneously portraying a nude man and other sexual imagery in separate picture boxes) is pornography, not eroticism.",1501200000,,3111,4.568592057761733

We need more filmmakers prepared to do this because otherwise cinema becomes boring.  Just more stories about believable characters in believable situations. I see enough believable people in believable situations every day of the week. I want cinema to take me away from all that, to a world which is bizarre, surreal, strange. Figgis did it. If you go back to the 1920's, you'll see artists like Man Ray playing around with the concept of what cinema MIGHT be.

8026435,4,B0002CYURU,"""The Hotel""(2001) is an experimental, dogma film, directed by Mike Figgis, and shot in Venice. In the Hotel Hungaria there are various groups of people, such as a film crew, which is shooting ""The Duchess of Malfi"", as well as a hit man, a call girl, and a Hollywood producer. The production started with a structure, but no script, and so the actors were asked to improvise. Mike Higgis filmed the movie with a specially rigged digital camera, sometimes utilizing night vision, which gave some of the sequences an eerie quality, with the actors eyes being strangely lit up like phantoms of the night. At other times Figgis divided the screen into quadrants which emphasized the notion of various stories inside the hotel taking place at the same time.

The film has a mesmerizing quality about it. For those who have the patience to stick with the film one gradually is submerged into a kind of dreamy surreal world. Is there really any story or meaning here? There seems to be, but maybe not, it's as if one is pulled off into a world where imagination and reality shift about each other, as we wander through the corridors and rooms of the hotel, and then out into the dark, mysterious Venetian streets and canals.

Music and sound form an important aspect of the movie. The click clack of the flamenco dancers shoes echoes throughout the film like a motif of passion. Piano chords dramatically portend to the dangers lurking in this hotel. The movie opens with a surreal scene of cannibalism, with diners dining in cell like quarters. The danger is always there. As one occupant mentions, Venice has a sordid history. The prison in the gothic Ducal Palace sits on the perimeter of St. Mark's square where the actors are performing. People seem unbounded by social codes of conduct, and act to their base desires, and instincts. Some engage in sexual behavior, while others behave like dogs, or werewolves transformed by the night, as two of the men periodically snarl into each other's faces.

In some ways I'm reminded of the movie ""Last Year at Marienbad"", where we're taken through an environment of memories, and reality is only as stable as the character's memory of the events. As in ""Marienbad"" there are moments of desire and ecstasy. Figgis, though, takes these  desires a step further, moving into erotic dream like fantasies: a bare breasted woman, leaning on a table, pushes slowly up and down, dipping her nipples into glasses of milk; in another room,  a woman visits a man in the middle of the night, sensuously opens her blouse, and mounts the man, erotically licking his lips as he fondles her breasts. Eroticism and danger build as the film progresses down these dark corridors of the psyche which open up to us like the labyrinth of canals of Venice.",1256083200,,2773,4.76875
