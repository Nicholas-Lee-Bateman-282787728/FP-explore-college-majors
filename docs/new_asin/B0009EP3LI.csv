2283692,4,B0009EP3LI,"This DVD saved me and has brought back joy to my running. I purchased the book first and while it has excellent info, I'm a visual learner and seeing it on this DVD made all the difference in the world. I'd still recommend you buy the book, but this DVD is all you need to get started.

Results for me have been about a 20 second gain in my average pace for a tempo run I do on fairly regular basis to judge how my training is going. It's also made a significant reduction in the soreness I had been getting in my lower legs and my knees never bother me anymore.

Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is becuase there is still room for improvement in both deeper explanation of more advanced subjects he covers in the book and I think the author could be more lively in his delivery. That said, it really is an excellent tool and the best thing I have found yet on how to run injury free and faster.",1217289600,6,900,4.050561797752809
2283693,3,B0009EP3LI,"I totally subscribe to the ~concepts~ promoted by Danny with his ChiRunning method.  I even worked with a local ChiRunning coach to make sure I was doing everything right...yet, a year later, I'm being treated for leg and ankle pain resulting from a pinched nerve in the lumbar area, directly attributable to using a ""leaning"" running form, as described in the ChiRunning method.  And yes, according to multiple sessions with the ChiRunning coach, I was using the correct form per the method.

I'm now starting Jeff Galloway's run-walk program (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Running-Getting-Started/dp/1841261661/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Running: Getting Started</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galloway-s-Book-on-Running-2-Ed/dp/0936070277/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galloway's Book on Running 2 Ed</a>), which promotes a traditional upright running form, and it's actually helping me heal this low back overuse injury from ChiRunning.

My point of this review is twofold:  (1) Not every ""method"" works for everyone, regardless of how much sense it makes on paper, and (2) to really learn the ChiRunning method, face-to-face instruction is absolutely essential.  Alternatively, have someone videotape you as you run, and seriously examine your own form.",1191196800,107,1361,6.838150289017341
2283694,5,B0009EP3LI,First got ChiWalking for myself and it really works... I can move effortlessly now during my walks when I tap into the right posture... and that's good for someone who has not been athletic for very long !!! Then got ChiRunning for my daughter who is training for a marathon... she loves it. She's in her 20's and I am in mid-life and these books have helped us both get into better shape. I'll be starting ChiRunning next !!!,1184976000,5,426,4.405063291139241
2283695,5,B0009EP3LI,"This DVD is absolutely excellent. The DVD medium provides a succinct and visual explanation of the ChiRunning method. Since using its principles, it has transformed my running to become much more enjoyable and increase the distance and comfort of my running. After lots of knee and foot weaknesses, I found this revolutionary approach extremely enabling. I also like the philosophical grounding. I was so impressed that ordered both the book and the ChiWalking book, too. Danny's zest for life is the opposite of how one might normally feel after a run so it a good indication of the method's success.",1175472000,32,601,5.02
2283696,5,B0009EP3LI,My husband really enjoyed this book and found the information very useful. Improved his speed.,1168473600,4,94,5.333333333333333
2283697,4,B0009EP3LI,"There's always mixed reviews when it comes to running styles and the books written about them. I think Danny's method works for certain people such as myself. Since starting his method, I've been pain free and my legs and feet are getting stronger, my runs are easier and longer without much effort. I was a heel runner and suffered with multiple injuries, aches and pains and now I'm pain free after a half-marathon. This year will be my first time using the method in a full marathon and I'm sure it will help me cross the finish line faster, healthier and injury free.

This book isn't teaching you to be a world class runner, it's teaching you to be a more efficient, pain-free and joyous runner. The bent over technique may not work for some runners, but it may work for others.",1300320000,4,783,4.514084507042254
2283698,5,B0009EP3LI,ChiRunning has definitely made my running experience more enjoyable.  All the techniques described have greatly alleviated my pains felt during and after my runs.  I highly recommend to all beginner and advanced runners.  I would also recommend to buy both the book and the video.  The video so you can visually see what is proper technique.  The book because it provides a more thorough view of the methodology.  I LOVE ChiRunning!,1294704000,2,432,5.014084507042254
2283699,5,B0009EP3LI,"I've been running for pleasure for forty years. I have run a sub-3 hour marathon, have been coached by former Olympic marathoners and thought I knew it all. This DVD and especially the book that accompanies it, proved me wrong. I learned more about how to run with no injuries and with much more enjoyment using the ChiRunning techniques than I ever thought possible. The well-produced DVD demonstrates specific exercises and running techniques clearly and in ways that allows the viewer to participate and assimilate. It is to the point and not padded with unnecessary footage. I cannot recommend this DVD, and its accompanying book (especially the newly expanded edition) highly enough. The book,""Born to Run"" is a great motivation read; ChiRunning explains how to transform that motivation into a lifetime of pleasurable, injury free running.",1278633600,5,845,5.220588235294118
2283700,1,B0009EP3LI,"I purchased the book ""ChiRunning"" and loved it.  I then expected this video to supplement and enhance the material in the book.  However, most of the video merely repeated what was in the book--and not as well as what was in the book.  This video was definitely not worth what I paid for it.",1258761600,15,291,4.351851851851852
2283701,1,B0009EP3LI,"I have been a barefoot runner since 2005, at which time I re-learned how to correctly run using my awareness and the teachings of numerous sources.  I have read Danny Dryer's ChiRunning book and watched his ChiRunning DVD.  I have also studied The Pose Running Technique on DVD and the workbook.  In addition, I have experience practicing Qi Gong (Chi Kung), meditation, and yoga.  I have also studied anatomy, posture, The Alexander Technique, and Rolfing Structural Integration.  My partner is also a Chinese Medicine professional and Acupuncturist.  So basically, I know a thing or two in this field...

In light of the acclaim that Danny Dryer is receiving for his ChiRunning technique, there are some critical errors and marketing misperceptions that I feel should be addressed.  I base these insights on my own personal experience and my extensive research into natural running techniques and chi energy.

1. This book does not at all use the chi (qi) energy for running.  Dryer teaches a method of using gravity to encourage the body to move through space.  After reading and watching Dryer's published material, it is clear to me that he uses the term ""chi"" as a marketing strategy.  All things eastern - yoga, tai chi, etc - are hot selling points these days.  Yes, Dryer states that he has practiced Qi Gong under a teacher.  However, nowhere in the DVD or book does he teach about the movement of chi the body, its pathways or its functions.  Dryer should have title his technique ""Gravity Running"" instead.

2. Dryer combines a commonly misunderstood Pilates technique (tightening the core), claming it to be engaging the ""hara"" or ""dan tien / tan tien"".  While the dan tien is the chi energy center below the navel, never are core muscles used when working with this center.  Tightening any muscles will take a person's awareness away from the energy and into the muscular contraction sensation.  Contracting muscles may create heat which is often believed to be chi by many beginners, however heat and chi are very different.

In the original Pilates technique, as taught by Joseph Pilates, only the largest, deepest muscles of the core are ""engaged"" not tightened.  This is more akin to placing the awareness in the core while using only the softest tension.  Most people misunderstand Pilates and tighten the abdominal muscles which then causes improper posture.  Watching the ChiRunning DVD and observing Danny Dryer's posture, it is clear that his posture is far from ideal.  Improper core tension and running technique could possibly be the cause of this, however other causes could also exist.

3. Dryer teaches to tighten the core muscle to tilt the pelvis. This lengthens the lower back, thus straightening the spine and removing the natural curve.  By straightening the natural curve, the natural spring in the spine is removed leading to possible spine injury.  Watching the DVD clearly shows the postural flaw caused by this unnatural movement.  I am very suprised to see the noticably poor posture that Dryer and his students showed in this instructional video.

Also, by tightening the core muscles, excess tension is created in the body that will interfere with the body's natural movement.  By creating tension in the core, the entire body is adversely affected because the core is the body's center of gravity and the psoas muscles in the deep core extend into the legs and upper back and ribs.  Tension in the core will also restrict the rig cage's ability to expand sufficiently to allow proper oxygen in the lungs.

4. Landing on the middle of the foot works against the anatomy of the foot.  The arch of the foot acts like a rubber band that allows the foot to spring forward when running on the ball and toes.  Running with the middle of the foot first causes the ball and head to hit at the same time, causes jarring sensations in the foot, ankle, and leg.

As seen in the photos in the book and in the DVD video, Dryer wears modern full cushion running shoes that elevate the heal.  Ask any expert in anatomy and/or Olympic-level running will teach, these shoes are injuries waiting to happen.  A person can only get an accurate anatomical running experience by learning to run barefoot.  Barefoot running quickly shows us how to correctly run.  We can then return to running in shoes in a safer, more natural and more energy efficient way.

5. Danny Dryer encourages the runner to tilt the body forward, taking the work off of the muscles and letting gravity act as a source of propulsion.  Yes, this does work.  However this style of running does not make effective use of the muscles and creates a very awkward experience that does not feel natural.  Observe the running style of the world's greatest Olympic athletes and you will see all long distance runners stand erect while landing on the ball and toes of the feet.

If you have read this far into my review, you may be left looking for a solution.  My best recommendation is to read the book Running Fast and Injury Free by Gordon Pirie.  Pirie has held many world records and Olympic medals.  He is one of few runners who, in my opinion, has perfected the art of running.  His principles are based upon a lifetime of learning from top Olympic runners and beating nearly all of them or their records.  Since age 14, Pirie ran with Olympic record holders. In addition, Dr. Nicholas Romanov's Pose Method of Running contains value insights into the physiology of running.

Above all else, since most of us grew up in shoes, we must re-teach ourselves to walk and run as the body's design intends.  We must learn to move barefoot.  Even if we choose to run every race in shoes, learning to run while barefoot is a necessary part of the process.  So find a soft stretch of dirt, sand, grass, sidewalk or road and get started.  Skip 99.9% of the theory and get back to the reality of running.  Use your mind to observe your body and make corrections as you go.  And above all else - have fun!",1257984000,259,5987,4.75266731328807
2283702,5,B0009EP3LI,"For forty-one years I HATED ""Running.""  The shin splints, back pain, hip pain...not to mention the embarrassment of folding over sucking wind after about 1/2 mile.  My 10 year-old pointed to Chi-Running in a store, patted my belly and said, ""Dad, why don't you try this?""  I did and it worked wonderfully for me.  I've had back issues in the past (a displaced disk) and using the ChiRunning techniques has actually helped relive much of the pain.  And as far as distance goes,  the first day out I went 1.5 miles without walking.  By the end of the second week I was up to 2.5 miles, up and down hills, no problem.  If you're doing it correctly, you just chug along like the Little Engine That Could.  I can honestly say, that I now LOOK FORWARD to my daily run, excited about what path I might take, knowing that I can make it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ChiRunning-A-Revolutionary-Approach-to-Effortless-Injury-Free-Running/dp/1416549447/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ChiRunning: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running</a>",1252368000,9,1090,5.638036809815951
2283703,4,B0009EP3LI,I have read Danny Dreyer's book on Chi Running but I also wanted the DVD as a companion visual guide to my journey in improving my runs one day at a time. I like the principles I am learning from the DVD. My husband doesn't have the motivation to read the book so he watches the different sections of the DVD.,1240790400,2,309,4.081967213114754
2283704,4,B0009EP3LI,"I purchased this DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ChiRunning-DVD-A-Revolutionary-Approach-to-Effortless-Injury-free-Running/dp/B0009EP3LI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ChiRunning DVD: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-free Running</a>and related text about three years ago, and have been training using Chi techniques ever since.  I originally tried this approach because I could no longer run.  I had a long time Archilles tendon injury which had finally prevented me from training.  The techniques taught in this DVD and the text allowed me to continue to train again, including running marathons and competing in Ironman competitions.  However, I did overtrain my hamstring muscles leading to injury and ischium tuberosity pain.
  One person wrote of a plantar faciitis problem.  I don't know about that. But, after 3 years of running with this technique and using a running metronome while training I have had no problems in this area but, I do have high arches, if that makes any difference.  Initially, I ran much slower albiet easier, then better and faster, and all the time with less effort and a more stable heart rate.  I am a senior runner, being over 61 years-of-age.  (But, I am still a runner!)
  These techniques can get you back on your feet if you have had certain leg and knee injuries.  But like all exercise,  remember to warm up properly prior to training.
  I do feel that the $40 cost for the DVD is a bit high.",1238112000,8,1491,5.56
2283705,5,B0009EP3LI,"This is aimed at your average person who wants to run with better technique - which suited me perfectly.  My shins were killing me and I needed to find some help.  Adapting my running technique to ChiRunning has helped a lot!  Although it is an inspiring DVD, I have to admit that I don't much love running any more than I did before.  But at least I'm also not in the pain that I was in.  I read the book after watching the DVD and much prefer just watching the DVD.  You don't need both; the DVD is enough.",1230768000,4,508,4.08080808080808
2283706,5,B0009EP3LI,I loved running but hated the pain. This book and the method have completely changed my perception. Now running feels good again; like when you were a kid and would run with wild abandon and no effort. Fantastic. I'm 45 and loving it.,1217894400,4,234,4.465116279069767

8059539,5,B0009EP3LI,"It has taken me a year since using this technique to get any faster than a jog.  Mostly because it takes time to build your core which is the foundation of this technique.  However, I am most definitely faster.  Danny's technique has helped me stop getting knee problems and correct my running posture.  This will work, it's not a miracle cure.  You actually have to run.  But if you're like me and you've always sucked at running, at least you know the 'right' way to just start.",1396224000,,480,4.459770114942529

I only began running  about 7 months ago on a walk to run program. I started doing events and met several people who told me about Chi Running. Eventually I tried it and my running has not been the same since. It works so well it is almost beyond belief, in my opinion.

Visited a sports injury doctor when it got real bad and she recommended that I consider chi-running. There was no way I was going to give up running since I love it so much, so I went to a local workshop and then bought this DVD. I've been ""chi-running"" for about 6 months now and my injuries have disappeared, I can run faster for longer periods of time, it really is more effortless running by shifting the weight correctly across your body when running.
