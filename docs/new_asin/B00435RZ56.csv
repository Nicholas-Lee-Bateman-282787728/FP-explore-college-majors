4253678,4,B00435RZ56,"Certain holidays in India belong to stars that choose to release their movies on those days and ensuring they become a hit. Aamir Khan ahs released his last two films on Decemeber 25th  i.e  Ghajini and 3 Idiots. Salman had his last hit released on Eid i.e. Wanted and this year he seems to have secured Eid as his day of release with Dabanng.
Hell bent on shattering records it has earned in two weeks what Ghajini did over its entire lifetime, Dabanng is the flavor of the season, like an old wine in a new bottle. In a gist the story is of two step brothers Salman ( Chulbul Pandey ) and  Arbaaz Khan ( Makhichand Panday ) harbor small time resentment towards each other when a serious event turns in to deadly enmity. The movie is essentially driven by treatment of the subject and by witty dialogue and some superb fight sequences especially in the opening scene, the railway station and in the climax. The music is also great with some exceptional tracks including the title track and has been filmed extremely well. I was disappointed in the item number by Malaika Arora because I thought she did not exude the necessary raunchiness that the song required.  There are also several character artistes but they are hardly there, Anupam Kher, Mahesh Manjrekar , Dimple Kapadia and Vinod Khanna are wasted. Sonakshi Sinha sparkles and oozes freshness in every scene, the camera makes her look radiant from all angles. The movie right from the opening scenes till the end belongs to Salman Khan, who displays his star power by transforming himself completely in the role of Chulbul Robinhood Panday. This is Salman like you have never seen before, I think he is the sole reason that the movie worked. He shines through the film and will be remembered for this for a long time to come. This is a ground breaking film for him, he finds himself and delivers entertainment that will find new fans and loyalists to love him even more. Last year he gave us Wanted and this year Dabanng with the ending lines suggesting a sequel. Go and watch this one for pure entertainment and paisa vasooli......4 stars 9/23/10",1285286400,2,2108,4.64343163538874
4253679,3,B00435RZ56,"If you ever wondered about the appeal of Bollywood superstar Salman Khan--and for some, it is a matter of wonder--'Dabangg' makes it loud and clear why he's had a fanatical following for more than two decades.

While most actors strive to challenge themselves with diverse and difficult roles, many get pigeonholed nonetheless by audience expectations and/or their own limitations. While the latter doesn't apply to Khan, the former certainly does. He's made a career out of playing simple, macho, and usually shirtless heroes--and the masses love his shtick for the fun, lowbrow entertainment that it is. We've seen, at times, an intriguingly complicated Khan on-screen--more like his real-life persona--but unfortunately, he usually gets punished for it at the box office. Now middle-aged, Khan seems to have resigned himself to his lot and wholeheartedly embraced what made him famous.

His character in 'Dabangg,' Chulbul Pandey, is a cop in dusty, rural India. He's corrupt, but he only steals from bad guys--his brand of justice, you might say--and he gives them a thrashing to boot. His overriding quality is likeability. He's always good for a laugh, even when he's kicking butt. Khan doesn't overplay the character; he revels in it. He's never visibly enjoyed a role more. And watching him pour himself into the part is a hoot.

The film borders on spoof; parts are purposely ridiculous and cartoonish. But mostly, it's a celebration of old-time masala--that heady, over-the-top mix of action, romance, comedy, and melodrama for which Bollywood is best known, but a style that has become tempered in recent years.

The fight scenes are the film's best moments--as tightly, pleasingly choreographed as the musical numbers--even more so. 'Dabangg' is otherwise marred by a paper-thin plot, the best jokes are overdone, and the romance is hindered by the unimpressive debut of actress Sonakshi Sinha, who frowns her way through her performance.

The other actors deliver a mixed bag. Dimple Kapadia and Vinod Khanna are underwhelming as Chulbul's beloved mother and hated stepfather, as is Anupam Kher in a throwaway role as a local politician. Arbaaz Khan, Salman's real-life younger brother and the producer of the film (the first for his new production company), plays Pandey's half-brother with an affecting meekness that gives the film, and the nuanced conflict between the brothers, some much-needed feeling. Sonu Sood, who plays the chief villain, is convincingly threatening, but while he physically towers over Khan, he and the rest of the cast remain in the shadow of the colossal common man's man at its center.

4253687,4,B00435RZ56,"Larger than life and vastly entertaining, DABANGG (meaning ""Fearless"") shattered the box office record in India, and now 3 IDIOTS, the previous record-holder, is all pouty. DABANGG's success hinges mostly on star Salman Khan's drawing power, but you can't front on the highly stylized action sequences, the polished cinematography, the sizzling musical numbers, and the cinematic debut of the gorgeous Sonakshi Sinha. The film boasts a masala of derivative plot points, but this is one of those cases in which the flashy bells and whistles work hard to compensate for the lack of narrative substance. Salman Khan is a friggin' rock star, man.

DABANGG takes place in the sprawling northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, a place that turns out to be a hotbed of combustible politics and police corruption. Salman Khan plays Police Inspector Chulbul Pandey, a character whom on the surface isn't unsimilar to his role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wanted-Bollywood-Movie/dp/B002VYJX8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wanted (Bollywood Movie)</a>. Chulbul Pandey, an unrepentant crooked cop, stalks his world with an unmatched swagger and a p0rn mustache. And he is the film's hero. Raised in strained family dynamics, Chulbul resents his indifferent step-father and useless step-brother, and this has surely affected how he sees the world and his sense of ethics. His mother serves as his only anchor. It's left up to you to determine whether he gains a measure of redemption. Me, I don't think he mends his ways all that much.

Do you appreciate or feel distaste for take charge men? Men who assume they know what's best for you? My eyebrows were consistently raised at Chulbul's rather perfunctory courtship of the beautiful pottery girl Rajo (Sonakshi Sinha). But I guess some girls dig that approach. Not that Chulbul doesn't melt at certain stages of his wooing. He is obviously very smitten with Rajo. To observe that tired old cliche, he's a better man for it. It makes him aware of the importance of salvaging his estranged family.

But all the soap opera hand-wringing feels obligatory, something to tide us over until we get to the bits that we actually came to the theater for: which is force of nature Salman Khan kicking tail with panache. With invisibly rendered wires lending him unearthly grace and athleticism, Salman Khan takes out armed goons in several electrifyingly staged action sequences: in a warehouse during a bust, and during a rooftop shoot-out, and on a train platform as assassins spring out of the woodwork. However, I do sense a whiff of plagiarism. I recall having seen some of the action flourishes in earlier films (the firehose routine is from ROMEO MUST DIE; the window slamming shut just as the thug is jumping thru it is from DISTRICT 13: ULTIMATUM). I probably missed other bits. I'll say this, even if ""inspired"" by other films, the stunts and fighty fights are stunning stuff.

But this is Bollywood, right? DABANGG follows that successful blueprint. It is action-packed, exaggerated, boisterous, lushly romantic, and so vibrant. It is unashamedly all of those things. The sleek production values suggest an impressive movie budget. I appreciate Salman Khan's having a sense of humor about himself. He willingly spoofs his action hero image. I love his ring tone dance. It makes his ""hero"" cop more likable. But you merely have to check out his performance in the amazing title song ""Hud Dabangg"" to realize why he's had such longevity. Salman Khan exudes charisma. Hours after watching DABANGG I'm still going around, jerking my belt buckle this way and that. As if that could make me fearless.

This two-disc set offers the film presentation with optional English sub-titles and includes the following bonus featurettes (but without English sub-titles): ""The Making of DABANGG"" (00:40:53 minutes long) and ""The Making of the Songs"" (00:27:07 minutes long).",1323561600,7,3943,5.272292993630574
4253688,3,B00435RZ56,"Most of the film is fairly routine but well done however, when Salman Khan plays Uttar Pradeshi's uber-machismo to the hilt, it's a blast. And the action sequences are gloriously ridiculous. There are just not enough of those elements though, and the film drags a bit when they are absent.",1322179200,,289,4.8

Well its no secret that Bollywood movies tend to be ""inspired"" (ahem) by Hollywood so that should be no surprise. Certain action sequences seem to be borrowed from the Transporter & other Jet Li movies. And if im not mistaken the producers have definitely got some amount of inspiration from the video game WET. Those who have played the game will understand ;)

This is one movie I'll enjoy watching again and again!",1309651200,,650,4.752212389380531
4253692,4,B00435RZ56,"Finally, a hit for Salman!

Well, this takes parts of every popular film in recent years (the part stolen from Sherlock Holmes made me felt shamed) but somehow all the parts come together.

The film is never going to be receiving awards, and will not be taken seriously, but that is the point.

Dabaang is good fun, and good throwaway entertainment.

You suspect the film-makers know its limitations, but at least they admit it. I was bored rigid by Once upon a time in Mumbai, another film that blatantly steals from other movies, but is excruciating due to the fact that the makers think they have created a work of art.

In short: if it is between this and OUATIM, then I would much rather sit through this again.",1307404800,,716,4.51937984496124
4253693,5,B00435RZ56,"Dabangg is in my top three of all-time favorite Hindi movies. It's Salman Khan's show all the way, but so many other elements of the film are wonderful as well. The technicolor opening credits let you know that this film is not going to take itself entirely seriously, which is confirmed when, in the middle of one of the opening action sequences, Salman breaks into a hilarious little dance to the tune of a mobile ringtone.

The film centers on Chulbul Pandey, a sometimes-corrupt, sometimes-noble, but always hilarious and kick-ass cop in a dusty, provincial town. The film could easily have been titled ""The Adventures of Chulbul Pandey"": Pandey-ji makes enemies with corrupt politicians; Pandey-ji fights with his brother; Pandey-ji navigates falling head-over-heels in love with the town beauty.

Salman Khan's characterization of Chulbul Pandey is pitch-perfect; he's both vicious and vulnerable. And it has introduced a whole new set of trademark moves into the canon of Salman-the-superstar: the belt-buckle swagger, sunglasses hooked over the back of his shirt-collar, and wildly drunken dancing. The filmmakers found a perfect match in newcomer Sonakshi Sinha, who plays the female lead with sensitivity and understatement (in addition to which, she's stunning).  Sonakshi and Salman look wonderful paired together.

The songs - oh, the songs! The opening number, ""Dabangg"", is rhythmic and throbbing with simple yet highly effective choreography.  The romantic ""Tere Mast Do Nain"" will have you falling in love and laughing at the same time. The supporting cast is excellent, from Arbaaz Khan as the slightly smarmy but not entirely bad brother (and Salman's real-life brother), to the sympathetic performance of Dimple Kapadia as the mother.

In short, this film is everything a Hindi entertainer should be. Watch it.",1302134400,4,1830,5.358885017421603
4253694,5,B00435RZ56,"Enjoyed it very much. I do not speak Hindi but the subtitles allowed for me to enjoy the movie. I first seen the movie on my international flight, the very next day I could stop talking about the movie.

I recommend this movie, it has balance of action, drama, and comedy with a very good plot. DABANGG means FEARLESS... good movie!",1301529600,,332,4.442622950819672
4253695,5,B00435RZ56,"This movie kicked ass, simply put.  After Salman's superhit 'Wanted', he got to do his dream project, the mega budget disaster 'Veer', where Salman can almost fly.  Salman has openly declared he has the hots for Angelina Jolie, maybe he wanted to be like Brad Pitt in 'Troy' and also name his movie after Jolie's 'Wanted'.  He gave Jolie his Superbike.  Anyway, Salman is great in this movie, he's not so serious like in Veer, but just being Salman the horny, macho, funny guy.  I'm glad this movie is a blockbuster, #2 all time only behind 3 Idiots.

Salman plays a corrupt cop who is not all bad.  The bad guy is played by Sonu Sood, just an excellent villain.  Sonu is 6 inches taller than Salman and has bigger biceps and looks like he's going to smack Salman silly.  They're making Dabangg 2 and Sonu will be back playing the villain's brother.  Real good news to me since he stole the few scene he's in Dabangg 1.  Dabangg has five action scenes that are fun and a bit violent (but kids today can handle it).

Do I like Wanted more or Dabangg?  I think I still like Wanted a little more because of the big plot twist at the end.  Dabangg has a very predictable ending.  Both movies are really good and I really like the songs and dances in both movies., even though Salman can't dance like Hrithik.

I have the DVDs but now I wish I have some Indian Curry.

(Oh, and the chick is pretty hot and curvaceous.)",1300924800,,1413,4.3320610687022905
4253696,4,B00435RZ56,"There has been a plethora of movies on the theme of destruction of the all powerful criminal-politician villain by the wronged police officer-hero in the badlands of India. Dabangg also follows such a theme, but what makes it a stupendous hit is its simplicity and straightforwardness. When it comes to dealing with evil, it has to be direct, swift, absolute and decisive, so thinks Indian movie audience, often frustrated by the legal shenanigans in what are perceived as open-and-shut cases in real life. Another reason why this movie caught the imagination of the Indian audience is that Salman portrays the policeman whose feet are deeply rooted in the ground. He is not a Messiah, out to free the world of all the evils, without a care about his own life. He is street smart, sly, practical and fully awake to his creature comforts.

Chulbul Pandey (Salman Khan) carries an injured ego since childhood, as he grows up in the house of his discriminating step father. His step brother Makhi (Arbaz Khan)  is dull and an idiot but remains a constant threat to Chulbul , because of his father's favors. The mother of both the sons, Dimple Kapadia, tries her best, in the best traditions of Indian motherhood, to assuage Chulbul's fear of discrimination.

Like many of his predecessor Indian celluloid heroes with similar troubled childhood, Chulbul grows up to be bold and fearless, one who carves out his own path in life, in short, Dabangg.  He lands up the job of a police officer in his own town, and hounds the dacoits and criminals like rats, which in turn rattles the peace of the their promoter, the wannabe political leader Chedi Singh. Chedi tries to use the idiot Makhi to bump off Chulbul after having successfully used a gullible Makhi to kill his rival, the big neta from the locality.

Makhi comes to his senses when Chedi boasts about killing their mother, whom both the sons loved so dearly. A remorseful Makhi goes back to Chulbul and makes a clean breast it, which in turn leads us to the climax of dramtic showdown between the bothers and Chediand hiss goons. In the final one-to-one Chedi is choked by the fumes of the silencer of a tractor, poetic justice for having murdered Chulbul's mom by taking away her asthma pump, when she was gasping for breath.

Dabangg touches the heart with its directness and simplicity. There is a taut unfolding of the uncomplicated storyline. There is very little diversion from the main story, although Chulbul's homefront and romantic angle provided much scope for sentimental forays. That is the reason why Dimple Kapadia and Vinod Khanna, both glamorous actors of yester years, are reduced to bystanders, as is Sonakshi Sinha, who plays a minor role despite being cast as Salman's romantic interest.

Two songs filmed with great ingenuity gel very well with the plot. While the title song sets the tone of the things to come, the item number 'Munni badnam hui' provides raunchy diversion to the badland proceedings. The Munni number has become cinematic history like the movie.

4253699,3,B00435RZ56,"The story, although not perfect, is fairly interesting. It's a story about half-brothers, who are brothers in real life as well. Salman Khan is the older one, who felt oppressed by his stepfather and half-brother when he was young and vowed to become invincible when he grew up so he could push them around. He becomes a powerful and occasionally corrupt police officer. The younger one (Arbaaz Khan) did not turn out to be well-educated. He steals some money from his brother's stash, which ends up causing trouble for the whole family. You might be able to predict what happens at the very end, but there are surprises along the way which should usually hold your interest. Oh, and the song ""Munni Badnaam Hui"", with the dance performed by the younger brother's real-life wife, is very catchy!

Now onto what I didn't like about this film. Salman's love actress, although beautiful, has an insignificant role in this movie. The subplot about Salman trying to woo her can be taken out entirely because it distracts the audience from the main story about the brothers. Another gripe I have about this film is that the action is quite exaggerated. If you've seen a fair share of Bollywood films, you know to expect this, but the fight scenes in this movie are TOO exaggerated, to the point that you almost want to walk out of the theater. After seeing one or two fight scenes, you know Salman will always jump in the air, flip, and kick everyone like he's in a Kung Fu movie, so you might as well fast forward those parts.

It's a movie I don't regret seeing, but I doubt if I'll watch it again.",1294531200,2,1594,4.589473684210526

8414180,4,B00435RZ56,"Salman Khan is Chulbul Pandey, a corrupt police officer, who beats the evil and fight for the right  and dances occasionally, sporting aviator sunglasses. A 2010 Hindi megahit Dabangg is a sort of Bollywoods answer to Jason Statham action movies, with more humor and of course danceable music. Even at mere 126 minutes the film feels a bit overlong, with several ineffective subplots, but the star Salman Khan in his top form carries the film throughout, with some rousing action sequences.

The story is in a nutshell about a Robin Hood-like police officer Chulbul Pandey, a crime fighter like Hulk meets Jackie Chan, beating up robbers and dancing to the thugs ringtone. Chulbul is confronted by an ambitious political leader Chedi Singh (Sonu Sood), but never loses cool. Besides the unique action sequences, the swagger of Chulbul is one of the merits of the film.

Unfortunately the subplots about his love interest Rajjo (Sonakshi Sinha) and good-for-nothing brother Makkhi (Arbaaz Khan) rather drag. Flashback sequences about Chulbul and Makkhis kind-hearted mother could have been more emotional with fleshed-out characters.

Dont take the films western movie-like premise of the one-man law-enforcer too seriously. This is an entertaining romp with dancing and fighting in the Bollywood style.",1408579200,,1302,5.336585365853659
