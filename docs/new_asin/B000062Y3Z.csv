1685614,4,B000062Y3Z,"Nothing in her previous work prepared me for Valerie Bertinelli's
extraordinary performance in this fine film.  Splendid support by
Stephen Caffrey who manages to give his role as Bertinelli's harried
husband some shadings.  Based on a true story, Bertinelli plays Laurie
Wade as both protagonist and antagonist.- and as her mother, Millie Perkins is sensational in showing her ambiguity and fear toward her own
child.  But it's Bertinelli's show all the way, and it's too bad she's
never had a chance to shine in feature films.  When one considers her
fine performances in such TV films as ""Silent Witness"", ""Ordinary Heroes"",
and ""In A Child's Name"", it's hard NOT to take her seriously.",1194307200,51,689,5.070796460176991
1685615,5,B000062Y3Z,"I have not yet received this movie, however I have seen it on television.  I believe this is one of Valerie Bertinelli's best work.  Her acting was brilliant.  It's an excellent film and would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys true movies.",1176422400,15,248,4.72093023255814
1685666,4,B000062Y3Z,"It's interesting to look back at these ""shocking"" TV movies of the week, esp. if you remember growing up with them, somewhere between the '70s and mid '90s. Since then, these types of movies seem to be relegated to the Lifetime network, and aren't anywhere near as good, I think anyway. So much of the fun was looking forward to these types of films airing, and then discussing them the next day at school or work.

And the fact that America's sweetheart/beauty queen, Bertinelli, was willing to portray something so dark, even with the unflattering breakdown close ups, is impressive. And she carries it off, you simultaneously empathize with and fear Tragic Laurie, often because of the uncomfortable and visceral camera work. And it's something to watch what feels like a Bertinelli meet cute film we've all seen unfold into something shocking  And nothing was spared while the plot held my attention well, and wasn't nearly as simple as I thought it might be.

Moreover, It is good too that not so much is expositioned as to the psychology of why Laurie is the way she is. There are hints at never recovering from an ugly duckling childhood, a pretty woman's inability to make female friends, rebellion against a neat freak mother, a sheltered daddy's girl, parental denial, etc. But these things explain common ordinary insecurities, dysfunctions. Not shooting sprees, or even vandalizing your own home and person. Ultimately the issue is one of severe mental illness not properly treated. Of course if you look into the real case inspiring this fictionalized-although very minimally- Laurie, a lot of other issues open up, such as the unlicensed SSRIs Dann was on. (According to Wiki something?)

Anyhow, it is now one of my favorite vintage movie of the weeks. However becaus of the tragic events, I just wish it wasn't a true story.",1515283200,,1840,4.906752411575563
1685667,4,B000062Y3Z,Hard to watch at times because it is based on actual events and is so sad. It is shocking to see what a psychotic mind is going through and the bazaar behavior they cab display. Parents in denial and a Physiatrist that's a clueless quack sure didn't help. Valerie Bertinelli is so good in this.,1506124800,,294,4.363636363636363

1685669,5,B000062Y3Z,"Especially hard for me to watch, as I grew up in the town where the true story happened, and I am a public school teacher who works with this story and others in the back of my mind every day.  Valerie Bertinelli was terrific.  What a great performance!  Yes, it's hard to watch, but it's the true story of psychosis, and everyone should be familiar with it as long as such things occur with regularity in our schools and our society.",1504396800,,434,4.333333333333333
1685670,5,B000062Y3Z,"This movie is a dramatization of a true story.  The main character, superbly played by Valerie Bertinelli is Laurie Wasserman, (last name was changed for the movie) who shot several children at an elementary school and another person at a house she escaped to after the shooting.  The movie is an incredible study of mental illness and is very well scripted & the acting is excellent - especially Ms. Bertinelli's performance.  It is absolutely amazing to watch Ms. Bertinelli go from a very attractive woman to a raging maniac again & again - what a talent!
You'll definitely watch it more than once.",1492732800,3,601,4.815533980582524

1685677,5,B000062Y3Z,"Murder of Innocence was difficult for me to watch because it reminded me of the nightmarish experience I had when trying to get help for a family member as she descended into madness. Valerie Bertinelli's performance as Laurie was outstanding; what a talented actor she is when given the proper role. The supporting cast, especially Millie Perkins, was strong as well.

Without revealing the end, I sadly assure viewers that everything but the conclusion happened to me in my frantic attempts to help my niece, a beautiful young woman. In my presence, she repeatedly manipulated social workers, experienced mental health professionals and law enforcement personnel. They believed her twisted tales in which she turned everything around on me. At various times over two years, I feared not only for my safety, but also for the possibility that *I* would be either arrested or involuntarily committed to a mental hospital. I often wonder if things would have been different if Laurie and my niece had been poor and unattractive.

Millie Perkins portrayal as Laurie's mother was spot on, as was that of Laurie's father. Persistent denial, keeping Laurie's illness secret even from her new husband, placing blame on everyone but themselves while having mental health issues of their own was all too reminiscent of my reality.

An excellent film,  Murder of Innocence is not for the faint of heart.",1484352000,,1393,5.0964912280701755

Valerie Bertinelli did an incredible job taking on the difficult primary role of this film and I have not yet looked up the actual story it's based on. You don't have to know the real story to appreciate the danger this film clearly demonstrates when alarms are raised regarding mental illness to get care for the person at risk and in need, and the effect to direct family members, their friends and community.

1685807,3,B000062Y3Z,"This is a very weird film and really difficult to rate. Valerie Bertinelli gave a very impressive performance of a mentally disturbed woman plunging deeper into a state of madness.
What makes this film border on levels of absurdity are how no one in the film seems to really lift a finger to help this poor woman who shows glaring signs of mental instability. No one! After coming home to find his new bride has scrawled incoherent babble all over the bedroom walls with lipstick he doesn't take her to the hospital for an MRI or CT scan to find the root of her obvious mental illness. He just decides to call her parents to tell them to come get her and he wants out of the marriage. Wow.
Another absurdity is when a character is literally stabbed with an ice pick....IN THE CHEST!...and cops come and place a little bandage over it and he's right as rain and walking around in the next scene. No hospital needed.....An ICE PICK....IN THE CHEST!! STABBED!....It's just not possible LOL.
What really makes this film is the final 30 minutes which are heavily dramatic & filled with tension and suspense. It's even a bit difficult to watch as it build up to it's climax. The 3 stars I gave all go for Valerie Bertinelli's performance.",1436400000,,1232,4.554054054054054

The movie is dark, depressing, haunting, intense and sad. It was difficult to watch, but I couldn't turn away.
Knowing this is a true story makes it even more gripping. The mental illness of this woman is so unreal! Bertinelli is really amazing in this part.
You will shake your head in awe while watching this. It can get brutal, but it's very interesting... Creepy too. I recommend this movie. It just amazes me how truly ill some people are mentally. My heart breaks for the victims...ALL of them in this true story. I just watched it, and I feel uneasy and sad. I need to watch something cheerful now...like, Market Warriors (PBS) . Great show...

""Could have been good with a tighter script and better writers"" I got very interested as her parents were totally unconscious  (or were not smart enough) people  to even think that their child desperately needed help early on. By the time she married she was totally nuts.

Some scenes could have been left out. I believe the director replaced good writing with raw over the top nauseating scenes. As a movie goer and someone who could have enjoyed the film as the acting was good,  I would not recommend it.

 I would think that a college class in film making could benefit by seeing what not to do.

I resented the parents for pretending to everyone that Valerie was fine with no history of psychological problems when clearly it all started in her childhood. The drawings on the walls etc. must have started then. I can't believe what a stupid psychiatrist she had. I came up with multiple psychiatric diagnoses which she may have had and suspect she had several at once. Her mother was very cold and could have prevented that teenager from being shot at the end but instead told him he has to call back when Valerie's father is home and returns with the car. The mother exhibited signs of mental illness also to me but not as severe as Valerie. Why didn't anyone have her committed to a mental hospital ? I think she did the world a favour by committing suicide. It also took her out of her misery. I felt anger towards the father for always covering up for his daughter and his denial especially when he had been informed that she had a gun.

Her husband told everyone she was nuts but no one would believe him. Amazing how the story unfolds from a seemingly great marriage to a house of horrors! In the beginning it starts out with SWAT teams approaching a house and a ton of police for one woman in a bedroom. I wondered where this was going. So, then it goes back a few years and you find out at the end why. Whew! I highly recommend this movie. Shortly after this movie I believe in 1993 a law was passed where mentally ill people could not obtain a weapon. I can see why. But, unfortunately some mental people did still slip through the cracks such as Columbine and Newtown which was a horrible tragedy. I need to put a comment in here; nowhere else to put it. When some college student buys 3,000 rounds of ammunition off the web and plenty of guns legally, there should immediately be a RED FLAG thrown by the person selling the items. Of course they don't want to lose the sale. But, if they cared about other people, I would have called the FBI to have it checked out. Watch the movie!",1407283200,,1358,4.2471042471042475

She plays a young woman, very intelligent with a bright future ahead of her who becomes mentally ill and psychologically spirals down a long devastating dark path. This movie is based on a true story of Laurie Dann (although in this movie, her name is Laurie Wade). The movie and Valeries acting were both superb, however, the movie leaves a lot of real life events out, and adds in a lot of events that never happened in the real story of Laurie Dann (the normal hollywood-izing). Even the tragic event that happens on Lauries last day, was embellished and is not a correct portrayal of the real story. It was interesting to read up on the 'real' Laurie Dann that this movie is based on, and see that even to this day, almost 30 years later, Psychologists still study Laurie's life, and have no idea what mental illness inflicted her and caused her life to spin so out of control.

1685925,5,B000062Y3Z,"""Murder of Innocence"" is based on the bizarre, tragic story of Laurie Wasserman Dann...a young woman who completely lost touch with sanity and destroyed the lives of those around her, as well as taking her own life.

Valerie Bertinelli delivers a riveting performance as Laurie (the name has been changed to Laurie Wade in this film).  It is one of the saddest portrayals of mental illness I've ever seen.  And I believe it is very close to what the real Laurie Dann must have been like.  We, the viewers, will immediately see that something isn't quite right.

Bertinelli gives a startling range of emotions...the shyness and deep insecurity Laurie was known for, the anger that occasionally comes to the surface, and finally, her harrowing descent into complete madness.  We see her battling with internal demons and sometimes trying to seek help but never finding the answers.  We see the frustration of her husband and the denial of her well-meaning parents.  We see the horror of who she becomes as a result of her illness.  We see her pain, her rage, her violence, her fear.  We see her inability to cope with life and to hold jobs.  We see how overwhelmed she is at the realization that she has gone too far.

To those who have never seen this film before, I suggest an open mind and a strong stomach because there are graphic parts that could possibly make you sick (I'm not kidding).  Spoiler alert...it involves rotten meat and blood/excrement smeared on walls.  Yes, she really did that in real life.  It's interesting that Valerie Bertinelli was chosen for this role because she looked nothing like the real Laurie Dann.  She is far prettier and has a youthful innocence about her.  Nearly every picture of Laurie Dann shows an unattractive woman with a dead-eyed stare.  But maybe this is what allowed Valerie to play Laurie so well...no one would ever suspect a sweet girl of such horrible things, would they?  She is cute and despite her issues, children seem to like her.

This movie is important in light of all the mass shootings that have occurred over the years, including the rare cases where women have been the shooters.

 Now about the movie-I tell you-it was neat-yet it had a bit of eerieness to it. The scary part was when the lady goes to the school and shoot those innocent children-which was how the movie got its name. The REAL scary part was that she commits suicide-thus leaving her mark on that mirror-she seemed to be such an unhappy person living with a severe case of depression-with her parents being in denial! She probably was not diagnosed which was why she acted like she did-even in her marriage. When I seen her as a child in the movie,even then---she looked unhappy-like everyone's laughing at her-which is why she clenches her fists like she's ready to go off on somebody. That's why she left her mark on the mirror-a picture of her face shedding tears-she was just so unhappy and took it out on innocent schoolchildren who had nothing to do with her issues. I guess life was too painful for her to deal with which was why she decided to end it all.
