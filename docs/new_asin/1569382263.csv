8357568,3,1569382263,This video has very nice photography that shows a lot of the places in the castles that you would not normally see. The main problem I had with it was I would have like to have known a little more of the history of the castles as it played.,1037232000,2,240,3.9183673469387754
8357569,5,1569382263,"This is a far cry from the usual dull travelogue.  This set of three tapes has good history, beautiful footage of the castles, and a nice selection of some lesser known ones as well.
My personal favorite was Caerlaverock, the castle of the Maxwell family (my own clan).  This was featured twice and the history was very interesting.
The narrator's voice and presentation was dramatic and engaging.  Go ahead, buy it!  You'll be glad you did!",1011225600,3,441,4.7631578947368425
