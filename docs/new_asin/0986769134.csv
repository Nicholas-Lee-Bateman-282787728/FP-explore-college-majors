7795557,4,0986769134,This DVD has excellent info and Ms. Tarman presents in an intelligent manner. But it's essentially hours of an informed person talking. I'm interested because I work in the field - however I think it would be too dry for many of the clients in the out patient program where I work. Maybe it would be best to just show them small segments here and there.,1366588800,,353,4.363636363636363
