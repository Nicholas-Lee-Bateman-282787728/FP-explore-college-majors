8655698,4,B006UANDNU,"I enjoyed watching this movie, which views the NFL draft from a different angle - we hear and read so much about the players who are expected to be selected in the first and second rounds, but ""late rounders"" such as those featured in this video who will be happy to be chosen in any round of the draft are often ignored.  However, the video's appeal is probably limited to those fans who closely follow college and pro football.",1402444800,,429,4.430379746835443
