3703185,2,B001MYIXAW,"I saw this film purely on great buzz. It made many 'top 10' lists in 2008 and I was curious about this film that I'd never heard of. I never saw a trailer and all I had to go on was a couple of wonderful reviews and a small blurb of a synopsis.

I am very open-minded when it comes to film. I love the horror genre as well as anything to do with vampires. And I usually like foreign horror. But I admit I was entirely dissapointed in Let The Right One In. It starts out promising but after that I felt nothing for the film, nor its characters.

This is not a horror film and should not be labeled as such. I'm not even talking about shock and gore. I'm talking about atmosphere. It was lacking. There was no sense of foreboding, no real mystery, nothing that made your spine tingle.

Yes, it is a romance of sorts and while it may be interesting in that regard, it still felt lacking. The main problem is that there is no backstory to the character of Eli. She is a vampire and she is 12 and has been for quite a while. That's all we know. I did some research after the film and found out from people that read the actual book what exactly happens to her. Her backstory sounded more heartbreaking than this entire film.
Without it, Eli was just a mysterious little vampire with an ambiguous past.

The acting was pretty good and I thought the actors who portrayed Eli and the bullied Oskar did a great job in that regard. When Eli very briefly reveals something pretty darn important about her past, it is not questioned by Oskar for even a second. Not even the fact that she is a vampire deters him or makes him blink. Some would call that sweet and romantic. I would call it unrealstic in any case.

I appreciate what the director was trying to accomplish, and maybe the actual book is very good, but as a movie, it feels very lacking and the ending leaves much to be desired. I swear Oskar's fate will be just like Eli's other caretaker/father/whatever he was supposed to be. And that is hardly what I would call a love story.

Update: Apparently, in the US version of the dvd, the subtitles get dumbed down big time. I just read this article and while I am not buying this dvd, I think it's important to get this info out for those interested:

3703186,5,B001MYIXAW,"Finally coming to the little ""art house"" movie theatre in our city (Albuquerque) was a little Swedish film I had assumed I would have to see on DVD someday:  LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  Thank goodness I was able to get in during its five-day run...it's a real treat.

This is a horror movie that is also simply a romantic drama and sometimes a very dark comedy.  It hews closely to ""vampire conventions"" yet turns them pretty neatly on their heads at the same time.

12 year old Oskar is a shy, weak awkward little boy.  Not surprisingly, he is prime target for school bullies and also nurses some pretty deep fantasies about exacting bloody revenge on his tormentors.  He drags through his colorless days (the film is set mostly in and around an apartment complex in a rundown suburb of Stockholm during the early `80s...and it's snowing ALL THE TIME) with little to interest him.  He lives with his mother, who doesn't seem to be home much, and only seems to enjoy occasional visits to his father out in the country.

One day, some new neighbors move in next door.  A middle aged (closing in on old) man and a 12 year old girl, Eli.  I don't think I'm spoiling much if I let you know now that Eli is actually a vampire, and the old man is her Renfield, the human who takes care of her during the day and helps acquire blood.  While Oskar doesn't figure this out for a while, the viewer picks up on it pretty quickly.

Here's what great:  the vampire in the film is stealthy, thirsty for blood and very strong (just like in all the ""old school"" vampire films).  She is also vulnerable to daylight, and her bite, if you aren't killed by being completely drained and having your neck broken, will turn you into a vampire.  There's none of the toying around with what defines a vampire as we've seen in the last couple of decades worth of vampire films.  Yet the movie shows us Eli as a person who is capable of human vulnerabilities and most importantly, human caring, loyalty and affection.

The film shows us the slowly developing friendship between Oskar and Eli.  These scenes are handled with great delicacy and if you took out all the vampiric elements, you'd still have a nice story about the blossoming friendship / love between two lost 12 year olds.

The film also shows us just how mundane the details of being a modern vampire are.  The acquiring of blood, the darkening of windows in a modern apartment, etc.

And when there are bursts of violence, they are thrilling in their abruptness and ferocity.  The sound editing is great, and while the movie shows you very little of what is happening, you don't feel like it is skimping either.  You are able to conjure up all you need to give yourself a decent case of the willies.

The two young actors in the lead (Kare Hedebrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson as Eli) are terrific.  They are very natural and unforced...they feel NOTHING like Hollywood child actors.  They are not perfect physical specimens...but the both exude a particular brand of innocence that can only come from a child just barely, but not quite, pushed over into adolescence.  Even the bullies in the film, while certainly not carefully fleshed out, are not cardboard characters.  They are all the more menacing because they seem completely possible.

This movie will make you laugh as you shudder.  It will make you feel warm and sentimental, even when something brutally violent is happening.  There is nothing simple about this seemingly simple story.

It is VERY slowly paced.  While it held my interest throughout and certainly captured me emotionally, I must also admit to a little squirming in my seat from time to time.  Part of it stems from the fact that the movie is set in such a bleak time and location.  Snow falling on gray, industrial looking dwellings and schools.  A washed out palette was used overall, and this made the film seem oppressive.  While very effective and highly believable, that isn't necessarily the stuff that ENJOYMENT is made of.  But these feelings were fleeting and only sporadic.

This is a somewhat challenging film, not just because you have to read subtitles (which frankly shouldn't be considered a challenge at all), but because it demands that you see the world from a slightly different point-of-view and to show sympathy for a vampire and a 12 year old boy with murder in his heart.  But if you remember that this is, after all, fiction...I don't think you'll have any moral qualms.  I didn't!

There are many more elements that come up later in this film, but I don't want to hint at them for fear of spoiling its many pleasures for you.  Just suffice it to say that if what you've read above intrigues you about the film...you won't regret seeing it.  For me, one test of the worth of a film is if I find myself thinking about it days later.  It's been awhile since I saw LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, and I can still feel many of its moods and picture many of its scenes as though I had just walked out of the theatre.  By that measure, and many others, this film is a great success and highly recommended.",1230854400,5,5077,4.552980132450331
3703187,5,B001MYIXAW,"Vampire movies tend to come in two flavours -- either they're gory bloodsucker actionfests, or celebrations of goth hotties tortured by their immortality.

But ""Let The Right One In"" is neither kind or story. Instead this haunting, atmospheric Swedish movie is a poignant look at a very unique friendship between a young boy and a vampire child. Brilliant acting and a sort of pale, ghostly directorial style make this a vivid experience, but the brilliance is in the story itself.

One winter night, Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) sees a car drop off his two new neighbors. He doesn't pay much attention at first, since he's always either ignored or bullied.

But as he vents his frustrations by stabbing a tree, he sees the ghostly, rumpled Eli (Lina Leandersson), who informs him, ""Just so you know, I can't be your friend."" She turns out to be as much of an oddball as Oskar -- especially since she only ventures out at night, smells a bit funny, and is unaffected by the winter cold. But despite her odd greeting, the two strike up a friendship.

At the same time, a series of brutal murders are taking place all around town -- and it's no great shock that Eli's companion Hakan (Per Ragnar) is harvesting blood for Eli. Being no idiot, Oskar realizes that Eli is a bona fide vampire, and doesn't intend to let that get in the way of their puppy love. Yet when Hakan's errands go horribly awry, Oskar finds himself to be the only person Eli can rely on.

It's no great exaggeration to say that ""Let the Right One In"" is undoubtedly the best vampire movie made in many years. While the movie has plenty of more violent moments and a snowy backdrop, director Tomas Alfredson is far more focused on the sweet, eerie relationship between two lonely, otherworldly young children. And actually, one of them is young in appearance only.

Alfredson paints the movie in white, scarlet and black -- pale, wintry light and snow that covers the world, occasional splatters of blood and deep shadows that seem to swallow everything up. And he handles the entire storyline gracefully. Every part of the movie has the same matter-of-fact, unflinching treatment, including the nastier parts -- such as a gruesome blood-harvesting murder by Hakan, or when Eli attempts to enter a house without being invited. Trust me, it's bad.

The most loving attention is devoted to the children's friendship, which manages to be as strange and beautiful as a rare dragonfly. Their nighttime meetings almost have the quality of a dream (""I might not be here tomorrow"") and Alfredson keeps their blossoming relationship from ever seeming cutesy or contrived. And it has an innocent quality that transcends the sometimes bloody, disturbing storyline.

And trust me, ""Let the Right One In"" has no sentimental ideas about children (even vampiric ones). They can be more violent than anyone, because they are more vulnerable than anyone.

The stars of this movie are undeniably Hedebrant and Leandersson, and it's nothing short of amazing that they have never once acted before this movie. Both have the ice-pale faces and deep eyes of otherworldly creatures, making their friendship seem almost inevitable. Leandersson in particular is brilliant at showing the different sides of Eli -- one minute she's shyly asking about a Rubik's cube, the next she's bellowing at her creepy familiar.

""Let the Right One In"" is a hauntingly beautiful story of children's friendship and love, wrapped in the most unique vampire stories in many years. A must-see.",1229472000,26,3511,4.905564924114671

3703189,5,B001MYIXAW,"Don't read anything about this movie, don't watch the trailers, don't imdb it.  Just go see it or get the DVD.  It's one of the most brilliant, heartbreaking, and beautiful films to come out in a long time.",1229385600,6,206,4.394736842105263
3703190,4,B001MYIXAW,"There are several sequences in Let the Right One In that would have been better left on the editing room floor. You'll know them when you see them. They did little more than take the audience out of the moment and distract from the real brilliance of the film. Had they been left out, I would have easily given the film five stars. I wanted to explain that up front, because, apart from this quibble, Let the Right One In is a truly wonderful film.

The film is a touching portrayal of love -- it's ability to overcome, to embrace privately what makes us original, freakish, terrible, and wonderful, and the lengths to which we will go in its name.  With a slow, steady hand, and with a wonderful gift for flashing glimpses and suggestions, the director, Tomas Alfredson, convinces us that this weird, otherworldly, and bloodthirsty place is simply another facet of the human experience.

Some moments stand out -- when the ""father,"" having returned home unsuccessful, asks for forgiveness, and his ""child"" lashes out in this ancient voice; when Eli, the forever-twelve-year-old vampire, gently caresses Oskar after she reveals, and he accepts, that she is ""not a girl""; and when Oskar leaves this father's house after the arrival of a ""friend,"" with intimations about why his mother and father are no longer together. This is truly subtle and intelligent filmmaking. It also speaks to the loneliness of modern youth. For vastly different reasons, Oskar and Eli have no meaningful relationships with adults. In their loneliness, they find each other.

In thinking about this movie, one theme that seems especially provocative is the idea of this ancient, yet physically undeveloped vampire being drawn to the young, innocent Oskar. Like the rare young woman who is wise and world-weary beyond her years, Eli gravitates to the youthful innocence of Oskar. It perhaps fills this long forgotten need to be a child -- something that may be inherent in her stunted physical development. But, at the same time, she becomes a mother to him, a guide, and, some might say, a corrupting influence. For Eli, Oskar represents, perhaps, a last, tenuous hold on her own humanity. Throughout the film, she battles the need to draw him in with the fear that, in doing so, she will destroy the very innocence that drew her to him.

Be patient with Let the Right One In if you think it begins too slowly. The pace is essential to its ultimate effect. This is one of the best films of the year, and one truly to savor in its graceful unfolding.",1229385600,8,2525,4.782110091743119
3703191,5,B001MYIXAW,"Let the Right One In, or Lt den rtte komma in, is a film directed by Tomas Alfredson (Four Shades of Brown).  The story is based on a novel of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-same-name/dp/0312355297/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the same name</a>&nbsp;by John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also penned the screenplay.  It is about an unpleasant and tender, but relatable twelve year old boy named Oskar.  It deals with his many problems; from his careless and divorced parents who neglect him, to his classmates who mentally and physically abuse him.  Oskar has angry tendencies but you can hardly blame the poor guy.  As the film unfolds Oskar finds some light in the dark cold nights of Stockholm.  He forges a profound bond with a lonely and desheveled girl around the same age as he is.  Her name is Eli and she is a vampire.

This is not your normal horror movie fare, nor is it in any way reminiscent of mainstream vampire fiction that I can think of.  It is afterall, first and foremost, a romance story and because of that the moments of horror were only in the back of my mind, and they work far more convincingly than I expected.  Continuity is also rare in horror films and the consistency of the characters and the performances of the actors who played them only worked to enhance the film overall.

An aspect of Let the Right One In that seemed exceptional to me can only be explained by mentioning a scene.  As retributive as it may sound, some of Oskar's bullies get their due in brutal yet satisfying fashion.  The scene is incredibly violent and is done underwater, but within the context of Oskar and Eli as characters, and at that point in their relationship, the scene works to be equally as beautiful as it is horrifying.  In the end I pity Oskar, but at the same time I'm not sure he has known any relationship better than one with Eli, and he probably never will.  There is a bittersweet feeling throughout.  I can't think of any film that brings a sense of romance to such extreme horror but this one pulls it off quite nicely and with little direct effort.

There has been talk about an Americanized remake of this movie but it will actually be another interpretation of the novel so I expect something dramatically different.  Either way, see this one whether in it's limited release here in the states or when it comes to DVD and Blu-Ray.

3703193,5,B001MYIXAW,"I first heard about this movie on Rotten Tomatoes where they displayed the red band trailer.  The blurb was that Guillermo Del Toro gave the film his seal of approval or something to that effect.  Instantly I thought ""This must be good!""  Turned out to be one of the most satisfying, disturbing, shock and awe movies I had ever seen.

I dare say this movie might just be better than The Dark Knight as my fav movie of '08 for the simple reason that John Ajvide Lindqvist, Tomas Alfredson, and their band of merry cast and crew achieved the same shock and awe that Nolan did with TDK on only 2% of the budget.  Speaking of Christopher Nolan, he used to be a low budget master as well and there's no reason for Alfredson and his cast and crew of this film not to follow his path to greatness if they keep at the craft.  The story will blow your mind, the camerawork is phenomenal, the acting is spot on, and the soundtrack is sorrowfully gut wrenching.

I regret to say that this movie had such a limited release, and on top of that, Twilight stole most of LTROI's thunder in the states.  Not only that, but my other big regret is that this is one of those stories where it's so damn good, you wish there will be a sequel and yet know deep in the back of your mind there probably won't be one given that the actors won't be able to stay young.  That's the big reason I'm rooting for a US remake while others are booing it: It's the closest we'll get to a sequel.  There's plenty of good remakes out there if you open your eyes a little.

3703229,5,B001MYIXAW,"Maybe its a controversial or ""uncool"" (or at least rare) opinion, but I can't choose a favorite between this film and the American remake Let Me In.  Both are powerful and beautiful in their own way.  Though maybe tie goes to the original?  Like if you tied me up and said I had to pick?  Fine, I'll pick this one ;)  Just seems like the ""easy route"" to always bash a remake, like something film snobs would do, but anyway.  Also really liked the book these films were based on, which got me into the work of Swedish horror writer John Ajvide Lindqvist.  Also got me into the music of Morrissey and The Smiths - basically I'm trying to say a lot of good things have come into my life thanks to this ""franchise"" :)

I guess its just a story that really speaks to me, no matter what form its told in.  I think we all have stories that speak to us primally that way.  I think what really drew me to the story was relating so much to main character Oskar (even though, at 40, I'm much older than he, haha).  I think anyone who's been bullied should be able to relate to him pretty easily.  Feeling different from others, wanting revenge on the bullies, falling for the first person who seems like they can rescue/save him from that fate (if only I'd had someone in my life like Eli!).  I really fell (platonically) for Eli.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,,1669,4.321543408360129

3703233,5,B001MYIXAW,"Overall, the film ranked very high with me. Visually stunning, it managed to deliver a cinematic experience that easily captured the same foreboding atmosphere and mood established within the book. The cast effortlessly portrays what I felt to be a not only fair but interesting depiction of each character.
While it seems that a lot of the graphic scenes and more explicit content were omitted when transferring the story to film, it was a decision that was probably necessary. There are somethings that are just not as digestible when handed to you in image. There is a strong difference between reading and viewing certain topics and somethings are just not acceptable on film.

There were however, a few minor disappointments with the film adaptation. Here are my biggest complaints:

The experience was too condensed. I felt another 30 to 60 minutes of footage would have been more effective.

Details that contributed to the complexity of each character were lost due to the lack of dialog.  I felt that the addition of extra dialog could have replaced details that were lost due not receiving the narration that is provided in the book. Although I am torn on this matter because the lack of dialog contributes to the atmosphere.

There was simply not enough focus on the relationship established between Oskar and Eli. This is my biggest complaint and falls back to being too condensed. Time to elaborate on this would have been of great benefit.

Hkans role was completely downplayed . Admittedly, I believe this is due mainly in large to the fact that some of his identity was sacrificed to keep the film from becoming overly graphic.

I think too often we find that it is just impossible to fit an entire book into one film. There are always omissions and alterations to accommodate the big screen. The question is, was the end result effective? For me yes and a small no. A beautiful movie, but one of the rare occasions where I felt I might have enjoyed it more had I chosen to watch it first and then allow the book to fill the missing pieces. I do not normally recommend watching before reading, but in the case of Let the Right One In I feel it certainly could not hurt.",1493078400,3,2185,4.704188481675392

3703236,2,B001MYIXAW,"Come on, people. The vampire child theme appeared already in Interview with the Vampire. Here, however, they tried to mix it with Romeo and Juliet, making a 12 year old shy and bullied boy fall in love with a vampire girl. The problem is that of course it is not a girl anymore, because thats what happens when you are 12 for decades or centuries (again, IWTV dealt with this issue in a more believable way, showing that Kirsten Dunst wanted Brad Pitt as a woman, not a vampire daughter). Besides, there's no information on the creatures background, how she convinced the old man to kill in order to feed her and even sacrifice himself to protect her. That kind of information is crucial to a good vampire story, IMHO, as many good movies and series demonstrate (from Copola's Dracula to Guillermo Del Toro's The Strain).",1490572800,,821,4.63013698630137

The execution felt very wooden to me though. There was very little emotion in the dialogue (watched it with english sub) even the moments that Oskar (the main character in this film) was supposed to be happiest felt very forced. The pacing is extremely slow, which is common in foreign films, but you can predict the movie in almost it's entirety within the first 1/4 of it. The characters felt bland, you don't get any kind of attachment to any of them with a bit of exception to Eli. There's really no explanation as to why Eli does things and you need to know a bit about vampires mythology to understand them.

3703245,5,B001MYIXAW,"A truly disturbing vampire film that takes place in the bleak, snow-covered heart of winter in Sweden.  Isolated and preyed upon by vicious bullies, a young adolescent boy (Oskar) readily accepts the friendship of his newly-arrived neighbor.  They develop a powerful bond because they do not seem to belong anywhere.  That she's a vampire does little to affect their relationship - instead, it deepens and leads to the brutal climax of the film.
What makes this so compelling is the way vampirism is presented.  It is stripped of the romantic elements Bram Stoker so famously concocted 100+ years ago.  Here, the creature is much closer to what it is in its old Slavic homeland.  This vampire is vulnerable, impulsive, without supernatural wisdom.  Much of the time, she seems sickly and her empathy for Oskar humanizes her even as she is stalking new victims.  Indeed, the last scenes can't help but cast her in a heroic light - a romantic notion, to be sure, but one stripped of the gaudiness in most vampire films.
The efforts of the cast and crew pay off immensely.  The acting is understated and painfully realistic.  The script propels this story slowly but evenly and naturally.  Each scene is an integral part of the whole - I doubt there was much left on the editing room floor.  The setting is a bizarre and refreshing break: who would think to throw a vampire into the edges of Stockholm mid-winter?  It's a gamble that pays off well.  The environment plays as big a role as the central characters.  And the direction is appropriately spare, devoted as much to stark imagery as to the actors themselves.
This is not a movie for those interested in the Stoker-inspired vampire-as-demigod genre.  This film ultimately upends the entire vampire genre.  It takes the myth from the West and returns it to its Slavic roots.  Avoiding glamorous fables, it focuses on the painful personal interactions of everyday life.  It leaves me wondering whether or not the right one was let in after all.",1486339200,,1997,4.820588235294117

3703267,4,B001MYIXAW,"Strange though it might seem to say of a vampire movie, pretty early in this 2008 Swedish movie, you know that everything's going to be all right.  Oskar, a 12-year-old bullied boy meets and forms a friendship with Eli, a 12-year-old vampire girl -- although unlike Oskar, she has (she says) been 12 for a very long time.  The children playing the roles are very appealing.  Lina Leandersson is Eli and Kare Hedebrandt is Oskar  -- and, again unlike most vamjpire movies -- the erotic attraction is just on the innocent side of exploitation.  Also, the film looks great.  Supposedly, it's set in 1982 (about 25 years before the film was made), and while, in one of the special features, the director, Tomas Alfredson, reminds us that that was before the collapse of the Soviet Union, I'm not clear about what relevance that has to the film.  I wasn't tempted to see the movie as allegory before I knew that, and I feel no need to see it that way now.  Eli does encourage Oskar to take a tough stand against the bullies, and she suggests to him that he too sometimes would like to kill his tormentors -- and Oskar agrees with her.  But Eli is being kind.  SHE kills because she has no choice if she's to survive, and she obviously is to some extent horrified by that, but Oskar's situation is not exactly comparable.  He's going to have to choose to fight back -- and he does, though it comes close to costing him dear.  Oskar's acceptance of Eli, on the other hand, mitigates her self-horror -- somebody likes her just for being her, even when she reveals her secret.  And there are moments when the movie is genuinely funny.

The horror elements are discreetly distanced, and we never lose sight of Eli's predicament -- this is no suave seductive bloodsucker, and I'm not sure that we ever consider that she might grow into one.  It's a movie about kids who save one another's lives in bizarre situations, but when no one else is available to help them.  The sense of the grown-ups in their lives being in either powerless to help or not noticing a need for help is perhaps more horrifying than all the vampire doings.  Oddly enough, it's a kind of feel-good movie.  I enjoyed it.

Note: A couple of days later, I should add that my son sees the movie as being darker, especially the ending.  ""Think of what that boy's life is going to be like,"" he says.  He has a point.  Why didn't I think of that?  Was I just relieved that that the bullies had been overcome and let that be enough?",1479427200,,2486,4.451327433628318

3703289,5,B001MYIXAW,"Fantastic movie!
This was a healthy refresher for myself, as far as the vampire genre is concerned. As both a light-horror and romance film, this movie packed quite a punch. The pacing was right on point, and the plot did not disappoint, as the story slowly unfurls into the life of a young boy trying to survive in a confusing and covertly hostile world. Although somewhat predictable in its findings, the plot is still rewarding as the story progresses into dangerous territory for our protagonists.
The ending was probably the best part for me, and showed the intense side of the movie. Don't miss out on this one, even if it is subtitled. I did not feel as if it distracted away from the movie one bit!",1478044800,,706,4.566929133858268

I would like to like the American version but was spoiled by this sublime story and it didn't deserve to be remade poorly. The first time I watched it I was new to subtitles and foreign films in general and I was heckling it for the first ten minutes. Then something strange happened. I started to pay attention. Then I couldn't look away. This was one of the first movies I have watched in the last decade that I did not even have a desire to go smoke a cigarette, bathroom break, surf the web, clip my toenails...you get the drift. I could not, nor did I want to look away because the story was so engrossing, the characters so engaging, and the plot so fulfilling. So different from the norm that I was transfixed.

3703303,5,B001MYIXAW,"A good cult type film, I ignored the subtitles but did find them to be off with the actual language. I find more people get less from a film when they are off. Hopefully those who have the correct version are happy with it. For a horror/vamp film it wasn't to bad, I do think I have seen a second version of this same film that was more detailed than this version. Sadly things get lost in translation. Someone claimed Eli's protector was a vampire he is not, he is known in vampire circles know as a vampire's assistant, someone who can watch over a vampire and be able to walk around during the daylight. Not sure I would call it a coming of age film more like a confused, bullied, kid who falls for a vampire film, It had tender moments and not so tender moments, I would say this is pretty decent for a 12 year old to watch, since it does not involve the gallons of blood the typical B movies use. If you have never seen it the subtitles won't matter if they are correct or not. On my bucket list? no, but since I have prime was worth the free view.",1477612800,,1053,4.116504854368932

The main characters are surprisingly sincere and sophisticated in their acting. The story is definitely a new wrinkle on an old formula, and leaves one wondering where the journey will lead at the end of the movie. The movie was mostly sad, so this isn't one for young children or for those who get easily depressed. Still, this is a very well made movie worth watching.",1477612800,,571,4.490384615384615

So it was the late 00's and the Twilight mania was still pretty much in full swing. Vampire movies and fiction were less horror and more like tweeny romance fantasies. I admit at first when I heard the premise of this movie I almost immediately lost interest. Eventually curiosity got the best of me and I decided to finally watch it. So happy that I actually did.

It is arguably one of the best horror movies released in the last decade. I can say this with confidence having lived through all sorts of shoddy reboots, hacky ""found footage"" and cookie cutter demon possession movies. Let the Right One In was an original well directed masterpiece. It's very chilling and at times outright dark and disturbing as any good horror movie is.

Oskar is a 12 year old boy living with his single mother in a housing complex. He's bullied constantly and as a result becomes shy and to his peers strange. One day though a girl about his age moves in with her ""father"". Her habits are also strange; she only comes out at night, she plays in the freezing cold, and she doesn't go to school. He eventually learns her secret that she must feed off the blood of others to live. As the bodies begin to pile up and the dangerous nature of the girl Eli becomes more apparent to others around them, Oskar finds himself with the tough decision of defending or abandoning his only friend.

A lot of praise can be given to the film's camera work and story pacing but most has to be given to the leads. Both of whom sure enough are child actors. I've always had doubts about child actors. Linda Leanders and Kare Hedebrant pull off their respective roles very well. The friendship they portray despite it's fantastical premise (Eli is a vampire after all) comes across as very real.

Let the Right One In is a great experience, it stayed with me long after the credits ended. It didn't rely on jump scares, shock value or other cheap tricks to be ""scary"". Instead it utilizes it's direction, acting, and story to build a very tragic and haunting tale.",1477440000,2,2055,4.498659517426273

On the surface this is a weird love story, but I think it's also a film that asks the question who are the real monsters in this world? If you like vampire movies, but get tired of all the tropes and dopey Hollywood stuff you will probably enjoy Let The Right One In. It does not dress up the life of a vampire. There are no special effects, any  magical powers the vampire may have are implied, but never actually seen.

3703379,5,B001MYIXAW,"+++ no information about plot. Thus NO spoilers :-)

This is really a fantastic film and one of the best, which I ever saw - and I have seen many many films. I watched Ltt den rtta komma in/Let the right one in (LTROI) in the Swedish original with subtitles. In Germany usually ALL films are dubbed, which I loathe.
I generally love to see films in the original version, because that feels simply more genuine than any dubbed voices.

1. the Swedish here contributes a great deal to the singularly melancholy tendency of the film.
Another wow-aspect: the unbelievably great music-score, which NEVER forces itself upon, as like much too often in other films. And thus this Score supports/fosters the atmosphere in a simply magnificent way (the US-remake let me in - LMI - lacks this quality completely - too bad!)
2. the two young actors do act completely more unspectacular and natural - particularly Lina Leandersson as Vampirella Eli is fanatstic. She manages to enact her characters Eli in a way, that arouses compassion and affection for her and she also creates one of the most memeorable vampires of the entire history of film. Eli became truely 3-dimensional and alive for me. Very awesome!
3. the integrated coming off age part with first love/affection is told in such a marvelous visual language and patience that it was really a true benefit for me. Nothing here feels fake or specially designed-in. Oskar and Eli let me sympathize emotionally so much with them.
4. furthermore there are several takes and scenes, which I am never about to forget. Not to mention the virtuoso camera, which pleased me extremely well.
The original scenes were filmed in the winter with up to -30 degrees in north Sweden - and thus they feel so much more genuine and right, than the obviously way cheaper fake cgi-FX from New-Mexico USA in the remake LMI. (e.g. see the swaths when breathing out in the cold winter air).
5. the direction also provides some shock moments, required for a real vampire story, yet only to surprise me with a scene of such delicate tenderness and silent poetry shortly thereafter. Unbelievably beautiful. And kind of fairy-tale-ish. I loved that aspect.
-------------
Ltt den rtta komma in/Let the right one in (LTROI) is superior to the US-remake LMI in literally ANY REGARD.
Not, because the original is always better by mere definition, but:

a) because of see above 1st and 4th aspect.
b) the 2 main characters in the original are ""more alive and real"", have more intelligent dialogues (the dialogues between the two US-kids in the remake LMI are so shallow and stupid, it is really hard to believe!) and hence their fate also affects me so much more.
c) because some of the best scenes from the original were dropped, for what strange reason ever.

All in all LTROI creates an almost impossible blend/split between cruelty and tenderness, and this is truely great art !!!
And the pace of the film is not too slow - it is just right.

Let me in - on the other hand only is exciting entertainment cinema with some shock elements supplied. (approx. 3 - 4 stars)
However it is probably just perfectly sufficient for less demanding US mainstream audiences.

cheers,>>>>the notwister - Rating = 95% (A MASTERPIECE)

3703386,4,B001MYIXAW,"Let the Right One In is advertised as a vampire movie, which is
understandable since Eli is one of the best portrayals of a vampire in
movie history. She exemplifies the classic vampire rules such as
immortality, vulnerability to light, a need to be invited inside a home
before she can enter and of course an appetite for blood. Even so, the
true horror of this movie is not vampires, but loneliness. The young
protagonist, Oskar, defines loneliness: he has no friends, absent
parents, is constantly tormented by bullies, and to make matters worse,
he lives in an isolated apartment complex. He becomes friends with new
neighbor Eli, a relationship that initially provides hope for his
desperate situation. However, as their friendship develops, it reveals
that Oskar may develop a blood lust to relieve his solitude in the same
way that Eli's relieves her hunger. The movie is set in the '80s,
presumably to avoid adding cell phones to the plot, but Let the Right
One in is very much a horror movie for our times. There have been too
many accounts lately of young people like Oskar who tried to escape
their loneliness by harming themselves or others. While the movie
portrays such horror, it also provides a solution to it. It may be less
frequent if more people confront the lonely and isolated in the same
way Oskar first confronts Eli by trying to understand them first and
judging them second.",1447718400,,1400,4.765432098765432
3703387,4,B001MYIXAW,"As I watched this Art house supernatural horror tale at the movies I cannot comment on the quality (or lack) of the DVD version.

On a superficial level when, Oskar, a sensitive boy and victim of vicious and merciless bullies meets Eli a strange, beautiful girl who is unearthly pale, this encounters alludes to a Twilight type of romance. However, from this point the story departs proving to be a much darker and cerebral tale. Before Oskar and Eli meet the film opens to a bleak deathly cold Scandinavian night and a gruesome death in a lonely wood; the snow drenched on blood. Juxtaposed this scene, Oskar has been brutalised by a gang of older tough guys who warn that this is the beginning of harrowing and intense bulling. It seems that Oskar has nowhere to turn; his divorced parents seem disinterested in him. Although, it becomes obvious that Eli is one of the vampires stalking the Swedish town and it surrounds, she too is vulnerable and strangely at the mercy of the vampire who appears to be her father. Despite the chasm between Oskars material and Elis ethereal existence they strike more than a rapport. Their relationship unfolds as deep friendship rather than romance, however, there are scenes of intimacy and this is partly a coming of age story steeped in horror and dirty realism. Despite Oskar asking Eli to be his girlfriend before he discovers that she is a vampire both he and the audience regard her with sympathy. An example of this is as a vampire she must kill for blood to survive and does so with chilling ruthlessness. However, ironically she is more humane and compassionate than Oskars tormenters and their determination to terrorise and beat him. Similarly, despite Eli being a monster and danger to humanity she is also on the run. Firstly, from the man who at first appears as a father figure, the neighbours and the police. However, as her friendship develops so does her loyalty towards Oskar. At what seems to be his darkest hour she defends him and exacts revenge on his behalf.",1447459200,,2021,4.7414772727272725

3703399,5,B001MYIXAW,"Before I get into actually reviewing this film I first would like to talk about the blu-ray itself. A prior known issue with the home release, which many of the top reviews on here have talked about, was the lack of the theatrical subtitles. Magnet decided to resub the movie with mixed results, but now all new copies include the original subtitles that were used in the theatrical release. I highly recommend watching the film with the theatrical subtitles instead of with the resub or dubbing, just make sure you select them in the setup menu. The blu-ray produces a nice, clean, and crisp image with great audio. The bonus features though are a little lackluster only containing a 7 minute behind the scenes video and four deleted scenes, but for what is there is pretty good.

Now onto the film.

Let the Right One In is about a bullied boy named Oskar befriending his new neighbor Eli who has a dark secret. The secret though is plastered all over posters, review quotes, and the front of the movie's box. Eli is a vampire that does not like to kill, but needs blood to live. She has a caretaker, which some characters assume is her father, who retrieves blood for her. The film is about the relationship between its two leads Oskar & Eli more than anything else, and explores themes like good, evil, and companionship in unique and interesting ways.

Let the Right One In is often labeled as a horror film, but I consider it a dark fairy tale much in the vein of Pan's Labyrinth (which I also don't consider to be a horror movie). The film doesn't try to scare you or at least that's not its objective, it's always about the characters and their interactions. The film is littered with subtleties some of which go by unnoticed until secondary viewing or only come to mind after the credits have rolled.

To talk about some techical stuff the film's cinematography is good with nice shots that are pleasing to the eye, and the score is great as well always setting the mood/tone perfectly. The acting is great from everyone without one dull performance. The two leading kids deliver a real and believable performance that partly makes the film what it is. The filmmakers decided to go with practical effects whenever possible to keep things looking real, but CGI is noticeably used in some occasions with some computer generated cats that particularly stand out. The CGI though is never bad enough or on screen long enough to drag the film down.

In summary Let the Right One In is a fantastic film about characters that is expertly crafted. It's easily in my top three favorite films, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a dark and enthralling tale.",1442966400,2,2661,4.629237288135593

3703427,5,B001MYIXAW,"Let the Right One In is a horror film directed by Tomas Alfredson and it is based on the novel of the same title by John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also wrote the screenplay. It features Kre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson together with Per Ragnar,Henrik Dahl,Karin Bergquist,Peter Carlberg,Ika Nord and Mikael Rahm. The movie tells the story of a bullied 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a vampire child in Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, in the early 1980's. Alfredson, unconcerned with the horror and vampire conventions, decided to tone down many elements of the novel and focus primarily on the relationship between the two main characters.

A 12-year-old boy befriends a mysterious young girl whose appearance in town suspiciously coincides with a horrifying series of murders. Oskar is a young boy who can't seem to shake off the local bullies, but all of that begins to change when a new neighbor moves in next door. After striking up an innocent friendship with his eccentric next-door neighbor, Oskar realizes that she is the vampire responsible for the recent rash of deaths around town. Despite the danger, however, Oskar's friendship with the girl ultimately takes precedence over his fear of her.

Calling to mind the work of Anne Rice and Stephen King, atmospheric adaptation of Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist's bestseller is well directed by his countryman Tomas Alfredson as he reinvigorates the seemingly tired vampire genre by effectively mixing scares with intelligent storytelling. Beautifully shot, moving yet unsentimental, restrained in tone and consummately performed, it is a horror film of near universal appeal, and already has the feel of a classic about it.",1433635200,,1704,5.238095238095238

3703452,5,B001MYIXAW,"Much more than a vampire movie or a horror movie.  It's a story of two lonely children, just reaching adolescence, finding each other and loving each other.  A story of what it's like to be bullied, to feel completely alienated from those around you, then discovering a friend....but what kind of friend?  The acting is first-rate, especially the two leads, and the cinematography--the snow-laden Swedish landscape, the forests of birch trees, the silvery rain--is dazzling.  The ending is both violent and extremely moving.  Highly recommended.",1428451200,,545,5.364705882352941
3703453,1,B001MYIXAW,"Wow, I'm stunned by the positive reviews. The movie is very slow, dull and the only thing somewhat unique is the child vampire. I'm sure she/he/it wants a companion but ridiculous because obviously it can kill on its own, maybe there's some deep psych meaning with the grotesque daddy/child connection with the first old guy. The movie was mostly disturbing because of all the pretty young boys the director/whomever seems so fond of partially clad, really do not like the pedophile overtones of this film. Maybe the violent and blatant sexualization of children is considered sophisticated in some bizarre Swedish way, I find it repugnant.",1428192000,,640,5.104761904761904

It was  touching to see the bond build between them. Each helping the other, the acceptance by the boy after his realization of who and what she was. Most will only say she groomed the young boy to replace the old servant who died to save her. I guess the urge to survive is great in us all, and we would do nearly anything to continue our existance.

3703467,2,B001MYIXAW,"This movie is a pro-diversity/ pro-LGBT film. I am pro-equality as well, but am so sick of films getting accolades based on this merit alone, rather than for the actual content. We have here: a bullied pre-teen boy from a broken home who doesn't fit in with other boys, who is into collecting homicide news clippings (ok) and carries a knife just to potentially fulfill a murder fantasy that he may or may not have. He meets another boy who doesn't fit in, who is castrated and a eunuch but who dresses like a girl, wears his hair like a girl, but who openly states that he is not a girl (ok). Oh and that boy happens to be a vampire.  So far we've got Sid and Nancy, Bonnie and Clyde as pre-teens, the beginnings of the most potentially dysfunctional relationship, and a horrible scenario for future serial torturers, sadists killers. This is the ""pre"" story of a couple arrested after going on a decade of serial killing, after somebody asks ""how'd they get like this? Was one a ringleader?!? Were they teased as kids?!?"" Naturally, being two rats on a sinking ship, they form a friendship/ romantic relationship. One commits murderous atrocities for the other. They both condone murder for the other's benefit. What are we supposed to take from this?? Homicidal pre-teens are cool, so long as they're in gorgeous scenery and are a homosexual couple? That no matter how we turn out, it's okay because we didn't fit in as kids, but we found each other? Diversity, even of the homoerotic sadistic kind in children, is cool just because diversity is trendy? I gave it two stars because it's watchable.

3703489,5,B001MYIXAW,"This blew me away. It is incredible that a film can combine brutality beyond anything in ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""No Country for Old Men"", or ""The Silence of the Lambs"" with so much tenderness and innocence. It is beautiful and moving, something one doesn't often say about vampire films. I would not hesitate to describe this film as a masterpiece, transcending any genre.
The swimming pool scene at the end is an absolute stroke of genius, in which the protagonist doesn't see at all, and we barely see, the incredible carnage that is taking place all around him.  This is the right way to do horror - not loads of special effects and gallons of gore.
Please stay away from the Hollywood remake, ""Let Me In"", which is a travesty. Apart from indulging in special effects, according to the Wikipedia article, the producers said their intention was to make a film that would be ""more accessible to a wider audience"" than the Swedish original. This is Hollywood code for getting rid of an element that many Americans would find morally objectionable (the meaning of the repeated assertions that Eli is not a girl, and what Oskar catches a glimpse of when Eli is dressing in the bathroom), but which is as crucial to the uniqueness and depth of the story as the unicorn dream, and its meaning, is to the director's cut of ""Blade Runner"".
Sweden seems to generate a lot of talent when it comes to making films about troubled childhoods; other films that come to mind are Bergman's classic ""Fanny and Alexander"",&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lilya-4-Ever/dp/B000A2W52E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lilya 4-Ever</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Show-Me-Love-English-Subtitled/dp/B004I6K5RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Show Me Love (English Subtitled)</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life-as-a-Dog/dp/B004CUGM92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life as a Dog</a>. And the resemblance of this film to those is what makes me feel that, while Eli's true nature is a double-layered mystery in the film, it is possible see a further, third layer there: Eli as Oskar's alter ego, almost like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Club/dp/B001H1SVO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Club</a>. With the emotional frailties that arise from having an alcoholic father (from whom he is separated as a result of his parents' divorce, and for whom he longs despite everything) and a mother who doesn't seem to be able to connect with him, the bullying he experiences causes him to develop a fascination with morbid murders that contrast so starkly in their brutality with his total passivity in actual confrontations with the boys who bully him. Like Tyler Durden for the narrator of ""Fight Club"", Eli becomes everything Oskar wishes he could be. I think the film offers as insightful and penetrating a psychological portrait of what makes mass murderers like Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris as anything I know.

The hero and the foil develop a need for each other in realizing each other's needs in life.  These challenges and how they are met successfully met and not so much, take us on a journey that is as fantastic as it is accessible.

The film focuses on the developing relationship between a boy and his intriguing neighbor.  Peripheral relationships are examined; most notably, an adult brother and sister whose lives are forever altered by their interaction with the two protagonists.

There are brief, gory moments, but there is very little on-screen graphic violence.

3703540,4,B001MYIXAW,"In a small community in what appears to be in Sweden, a 12 year old by the name of Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is going through some trouble in his life. Things change when he meets a 12 year old girl by the name of Eli (Lina Leandersson). The two become fast friends and eventually they form a bond, however, unknown to Oskar, there's more to Eli than he realizes. -summary

 For the past 10 years or so, Europe has been surprising me and at the same time impressing me with their innovation in the horror genre. Either they freak you out with films like High Tension, play on the supernatural with the Orphanage, gross you the hell out with Inside, give you zombie blast aways and zombie madness with The Horde and Dead Snow respectively, or just plain give you a taste of that down to Earth realness with Eden Lake. They have just been straight up breathing new life into the horror genre and kicking Hollywood's a** left, right, and through the middle while they're at it. The trend continues with Sweden's take on the vampire genre  Let The Right One In, and despite its slow pace and even questionable feel as if something is missing. It was still a very entertaining watch, and although it hasn't made me into a fan of the vampire genre, I'll say it's a start.

 The film follows Oskar as he goes through his daily life, and is being forced to deal with classmates who don't like him. Eli who is revealed to be a vampire, is forced to feed herself due to her handler constantly screwing up jobs to get her fresh blood. Along the way, the audience will learn a great deal about the two.

 I enjoyed Tomas Alfredson's direction as he very well developed the two characters Oskar and Eli; and in the case of the latter, he made her into a sympathetic character, which is sometimes kind of hard to do with characters like these. Her situation is easily something to consider tragic, and although people normally pay for their lives due to her condition, there's a moment in the film that takes place where you just have to feel for this character. Oskar's situation is very easy to relate to, because he's a good hearted kid who happens to be on the receiving end of bullies, and due to this, he's being pushed to the breaking point, where he spends time alone spilling dialog to himself and stabbing a tree with a sharp knife.

 Let the Right One In is a film that is kind of hard to consider a true vampire film. It deals with numerous parts of vampire myth, and it even features the usual romance and death found in the genre; but Alfredson chose not to follow what has become standard vampire fare, and mainly chooses to deal with the character's plights, which feels a little more like a coming of age story. I found this to be a very fresh take, because quite frankly, traditional vampire films have been boring me.

 The two main characters definitely have chemistry, and the very fact their acting is so well done, it brought a stronger vibe to their interactions, and gave off a genuine feel as if these two young people actually knew each other. It's rare to find young actors who don't make you cringe at whatever they do. They also have the look of loners, people who are searching for that companionship, and when they finally opened up to each other it just had that special feel. Patrik Rydmark as Conny was another stand out and played the role of the bully very well. I truly hated his character and wanted him to get what was coming to him. He definitely did his job here bringing me even deeper into the movie.

 Let The Right One In is a great movie to me no doubt, but it does have its issues though. For one, I really don't mind when serious gore and graphic death scenes are left up to the imagination. However, the film could have used better kills. I thought the symbolism in regards to the snow was overkill. One thing I can't stand is directors beating me in the head over and over with their themes. If you have to repeat yourself, then you didn't say right whatever you tried to say the first time. I also thought the townsfolk belief in vampires was terribly under-cooked, in fact, it was non existant. So when a certain character found themselves in a dilemma. I found a few things about it hard to buy into. I heard this film is based on the book, and perhaps that's cleared up there, but this is the movie I'm talking about, so I can care less about what the book has to say.

 Overall, due to its character development, strong interactions, memorable moments, originality, and even an awesome ending; Let The Right One In does a very good job masking its flaws. The low gore level will appeal to those who can't stand overly bloody films. However, the slow pacing at times works against it, just about as much as it works in its favor. In any case, this is a movie I have to recommend. If you need a consistent flow of action scenes, and tonal shifts to lighten up the mood. Then this is not the flick for you. The movie has a 115 minute run time.

Pros: Fantastic acting, characters, ending

Cons: Small writing issues",1412640000,,5051,4.413978494623656

3703544,4,B001MYIXAW,"Apparently there are issues with the subtitles as most of the previous reviewers have reiterated over and over again. I think they're all missing the point here, but that just my opinion.  I watched the overdubbed version and I gotta say it took me back a little ways to the Pippi Longstocking movies of my youth in the 70s.  That being said.  Let's skip the heated debate on subtitles and overdubs and get straight to the real point.  This movie is amazing.  Pure and simple.  You will not find a more original vampire flick from the past 20 years (Bram Stoker be damned! Hahaha!).  Period.  It's not precisely scary as it is visceral. Disturbing on several levels to be sure.  The stark landscape of the Stockholm tenement.  The lacking of Hollywood-esque big-budget frills.  The eloquent acting by the pre-teen stars.  All of these things make this movie innovative and downright creepy.

Based on the deliciously vicious novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, the film tells the story of 12-year-old Oskar (Kare Hedebrant), a shy, introverted, despised boy who is often picked on by school bullies.  Oskar lives with his mother in a tenement in Stockholm (visiting his father occasionally in the country) when a man and a young girl move in next door. As soon as they move in they cover the windows of their apartment with cardboard.  Weird. One night he actually meets Eli (Lina Leandersson) while playing in the front of the tenement (pretending revenge against the bullies that constantly plague his young life). She is strange and pale but the two strike up a stuttery, strained friendship when Eli solves Oskar's Rubik's Cube. Oskar involves himself in learning Morse Code, which he teaches to the strange girl, and the two begin to communicate through the walls of their apartments.  Hakan, Eli's ""guardian"", does not approve of her befriending the boy, but she refuses his demands to quit the relationship.  Hakan goes out one night to get food for Eli, botching the job, when he is nearly caught draining the blood of a suspended man in the woods, and in the end leaving said blood during his escape of the scene.  Yes, Eli is a vampire.  What happens when an outcast boy and a vampire girl become friends?

What you need to know is that this movie is like no vampire movie you have seen before.  It's dank.  It's very Swedish.  It's alien at times.  Overdubs and subtitles aren't an issue unless you let them be, but if you do, then you're missing the whole point.  There are disturbing images (the word taboo comes to mind a few times).  There are bits of acting that transcend creepy.  There is a great story throughout.  The thing about Let The Right One In is that it hits you in the guts as well as in the brain.  It's gritty. It's real.  It's dark.  Definitely worth the watch.  Like Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, you will be moved, horrified, and entertained all at the same time.

3703548,5,B001MYIXAW,"FINALLY Magnet got it right!  The original release of this modern day classic was marred by the wrong subtitles, and it did make a huge difference.  There were enough complaints leveled at Magnet to have them rerelease the film with the original subtitles.  But for those of you seeking it out on the ""used"" market, buyer beware.  Under ""SUBTITLES"" the back of the DVD or Blu-Ray must state ""ENGLISH( Theatrical)"" in order to get the corrected copy.  If it only states ""English"" under subtitles then that is the wrong copy.  Magnet has refused to reimburse anyone who purchased their original copies.  Bad business, if you ask me.

As to the content; absolutely one of the very best vampire movies ever made.  It is both hypnotic and poetic in the way it unravels its tale of loneliness and love.

3703564,5,B001MYIXAW,"Should you watch this version of the film or the American version (called ""Let Me In"")? If you think Kubrick's version of ""The Shining"" is a masterpiece, then you'll appreciate the Swedish version. If you didn't like ""the Shining,"" go with the American version. Neither version has a lot of gore--the horror is mostly psychological. Like Kubrick's film, the truly horrific and haunting thing about this movie (particularly the Swedish version) has a lot more to do with what is clearly implied but never explicitly stated--and how those things are metaphors about unhealthy relationships in the real world. At its root, the vampire myth is about parasitic creatures who attach themselves to a person and drain them of their life-force, and that's the real focus to this unique approach to the genre--not the silly romantics of something like ""Twilight,"" but the question of sexuality and power relationships. I found the American version to be too Hollywood--darkly lit, bad child actors who seemed out of their angst-ridden depth and just maudlin. The child actors in the Swedish version are amazingly good actors. Oskar comes across as a frail victim--he's pale, scrawny, and has a perpetually runny nose. When he is ""rehearsing"" his response to his persecutors, it is violent, but in a believable way that could be just childish or it could indicate a propensity for actual violence that hasn't manifested itself yet--he's liminal when Eli first speaks to him. Plus, the bullying he experiences seems more realistic than the excessively violent episodes in the American version. Likewise, Eli seems like a kid--a worldly kid, but not a little adult in a child's body.

[possible spoilers follow]. This is a powerful movie in so many ways, and mostly for reasons that aren't obvious on the first viewing. Many reviews comment about it being a wonderful pre-adolescent love story. It's framed like one, and deliberately plays off of that sort of naivety, but it clearly isn't intended to be ""romantic."" Ask yourself why Hkan (the older man Eli lives with)is so inept at doing the violent things he does, or why he asks her not to ""see that boy"", or why he offers what he does at the hospital (and why she accepts it without remorse); then ask yourself how they got together in the first place and how old he was when they first met. Next, consider why she picks a victim like Oskar--she tells him explicitly at one point in the film, and you should take her literally. I don't want to blow the plot, but once you think those things through, and consider the future that lies ahead for Oskar, you'll clearly see it's not a movie about puppy love (maybe for Oskar, initially, but not for Eli, who doesn't just mean she's a vampire when she tells Oskar she isn't a ""girl""--something completely lost in the American version, where she's named ""Abby"" rather than the gender ambiguous ""Eli"" and is portrayed with much more stereotypical feminine attributes). The way the movie deliberately manipulates the viewer (like Eli manipulates Oskar) to feel compassion for Eli is perhaps the most horrifying thing about this film.",1406678400,5,3117,4.937142857142857

There are no random kills; each has a reason, a consequence, and has major effects on characters you care about. Seriously. Good. Movie.

Revolutionary scenes:

- the scene with Oskar and his mom brushing their teeth together and enjoying each other's company

I originally saw this film years ago and it popped up on cable the other night.  Interestingly enough, the night before they had a showing of LET ME IN, the English remake of this original work.

As I've gradually learned from reading novels by Norwegian authors, they have a subtly different way of communicating with the reader both through imagery and paucity of spoken language.  Their use of imagery in film-making tells more of the story than the spoken word, so having the English subtitles are somewhat distracting.

For anyone looking for a different type of a love(?) story, this film shows how young people gravitate toward each other and fill the other's needs.  Oh yeah, I guess that it's a horror story too.",1400284800,,832,4.696551724137931

Very few, in my opinion, are worth the time of day (or night) to fool with. I bought this after reading all of the hype over the movie, and several friends egged me on that this was a ""must see"" film. I bought the dubbed American English version and regretted it. Regardless of  the films supposed merits, the shoddy dubbing, and even worse translation from Swedish into American English was absolutely horrid. The story portrayed in the version that I bought, is just outright bad. An adolescent boy who lives with his divorced mother, is a social outcast and, is relentlessly bullied by three other adolescent boys in his school class. An adolescent girl moves into his apartment building and, they meet and seemingly strike up a platonic relationship. However, there's something not quite right about her (imagine that), and her odd habits. The bodies begin to pile up, and the story become's ever more convoluted as the film progresses. The ending is just plain stupid, and there's no other way to put it. Cassandra Peterson would have a field day with this one. At one time you could wait about a year and the ""Mistress of the Dark"" would air this one at 1 AM (Alas, she is no longer on the air).

Nevertheless, I first viewed this title at an art house theater at the University of Notre Dame and immediately fell in love with it, pehaps because it, itself, deemphasizes the gory aspects of the vampire genre in favor of the touching ""love"" story (if that's what it is) between the juvenile protagonists.

This film challenges us to explore the limits of our empathy.  It is easy to sympathize with Oskar, who is the victim of a particularly craven bully (Patrik Rydmark), but we soon see that he has a fascination with violence.  His flat emotional affect suggests deep psychological problems and his rare displays of happiness or satisfaction come at times when he has witnessed or caused harm to another.  He becomes increasingly bonded to Eli, even when witnessing things that would cause most to turn away in horror.  This film actually has a lot to say about the mentality of teens who end up committing atrocities like Columbine.  However, instead of going to school with a gun, Oskar ends upbut that would be telling.  This excellent films quiet atmosphere accentuates the horror.

The vampire theme is pretty subtle if you are accustomed to watching American horror movies.  There are definitely some dark elements in the film, and there are a few bloody scenes...integral to the plot in my opinion, however.  But It's also about two lonely children who do not fit in finding each other as it is a horror film...even if one of them is a 200 year old vampire.

The American/British movie production, ""Let Me In"" was also a Great version. By necessity however, it had to be ""Toned Down"" for American audiences who might see some parts of LTROI as bordering on child porn.

3703635,4,B001MYIXAW,"So this is a pretty good arthouse horror film. I can see why a lot of people liked it. I certainly do. Great cinematography and lighting, awesome acting from the young cast, and a wonderful twist on boy-meets-girl.

This movie is creepy in all the right places. It also makes you want to cheer whenever the little boy starts learning to stand up for himself against his Nazi-like bullies at his middle school. It'll make you cry, and laugh, and go ""Whoa!""

My only gripe about this is that there are parts when the movie almost makes you go ""Whoa!"" but instead, you're like, ""Huh?"" I won't give away any spoilers, but suffice it to say that there are moments where logic goes out the window so that the filmmakers can make you witness a cool effect or feel awed by a really clever scene. Instead though, if you take a moment to reflect on how that would have looked in real life, you'll kinda laugh...and it'll be AT the filmmakers, not with. Not to mention that if you really think about the character of the boy by the end of the movie, you'll realize some very disturbing things.

Anyway, that's a small, small complaint when compared with the remaining 95% of the movie that just kicks so much arthouse ass! Maybe it's supposed to be flashy and cool and noirish. I mean, I have no problem with that. Cuz that would make the world of this movie that much more interesting. It's almost like the filmmakers are turning all kinds of conventions and ideas about sympathetic characters and ""good guys vs bad guys"" and children on its head before smashing them down into the concrete.

There's a lot of symbols in this movie about fragile round objects. Eggs that break, apples that get eaten, big round spreading blood stains. I wonder what it all means. I probably need to watch this movie again.

Also, they should make a sequel.",1385683200,2,1829,4.53030303030303

Let the Right One In (2008) **
D: Tomas Alfedson
C: Kare Hedebrant, Lina Leandersson, Per Ragnar, Henrik Dahl
P: An odd young boy befriends a young girl that has moved into the same apartment complex as him. Over time, he slowly begins to realize that she is a vampire.

The central plot line involves two odd, weird characters that society has shunned away coming together and finding friendship and mutual understanding with one another. While the performances from its two young leads are competent as stand alone performances, the two young actors fail to find a flow with one another. They fail to ignite chemistry with one another. They just don't feed off of one another. People, who get one another or are friends with one another, have that innate understanding between one another and its just not here with the young actors of Let the Right One In. Since friendship and understanding is a key component to the film's story and the actors fail to convince viewers of that, the film's overall scenario isn't fully engaging.

Theres a sub-plot involving school bullies terrorizing one of the main characters. These scenes are dynamic, suspenseful, even chilling. These scenes come alive with energy and urgency. The problem is, it's a sub-plot and it's far more interesting then the main plot thread. While the film's initial concept is intriguing, Let the Right One In drags far too often until it gets to a scene involving these bullies confronting our main character. Let the Right One In touches upon a universal theme in its exploration of companionship, but the material, surprisingly, doesn't resonate because of actors who just don't connect with one another and a sub-plot that's far more exciting then the central storyline.

3703642,5,B001MYIXAW,"An interesting and moody film. A good example of how music and sound should be used; not blaring at you every second. The quiet moments without music are as moody and evocative as the ones softly backed by the soundtrack. The incidental sounds are nearly dialog at times. The visuals are wonderful. The snow is used almost as a background character. The camera angles and images often speak for themselves.
The two young leads are not only competent, but endearing and convincing.
The story itself is wonderful. Love story? Dark tale? Coming of age? Friendship? Learning? Loss? Which? All?
The only problem are the subtitles. I don't speak the language fluently at all, but even I caught quite a few errors and omissions, and just plain awful translations. But the story gets through even with the bad job on the subtitles.
It's an excellent movie, worthy of calling a film instead of a movie.

3703644,5,B001MYIXAW,"To be upfront I don't care for modern horror movies. All too often they emphasize gore and shock while leaving the characters and story well behind. Needlessly to say I was pleasantly surprised by ""Let the Right One In"". To say this is a classic Vampire tale leaves out a great deal of what makes this film truly special.

Oskar is a shy, withdrawn and unfortunately bullied student who is often ignored at home by his always-working mother and his distant father is an alcoholic. Oskar spends his time collecting newspaper articles of murder stories and pretending to get back at his tormentors by killing them with his knife. Essentially, Oskar has all the makings of a serial killer.

One night Eli appears atop the jungle gym in the courtyard and confronts Oskar. She tells him that they cannot be friends, but a friendship develops anyway. Like Oskar, Eli is also twelve years old but she's been that way for a long time because after all, she's a vampire.

More than a simple horror film, this is really a classic love story of two children on the brink of becoming adults. But while Oskar (Kre Hedebrant) is destined to grow older, Eli (Lina Leandersson) will remain the same. This simple conundrum is compounded by other factors. For example, the small fact that Eli is a stone-cold killer. Although we see her initially regret her actions, Eli is who she is and that's it. This instantly separates ""Let the Right One In"" from the more ""sparkly"" treatments of vampire movies in recent years. To say more about the story of the film will rob it of the many surprises that awaits inside. However, I will say that both Eli and Oskar come to resolutions about their true natures in a very logical manner which makes this film a cut above most.

""Let the Right One In"" is beautifully photographed, one of the best I've seen. Not just for the scenic overviews of snowy Sweden but the composition of the shots are truly powerful. The first time Eli is fully revealed is beautifully rendered in pan shot that instantly harbors her true nature. The climatic scene of the film which takes place at a indoor swimming pool is also a classic of framing where so much is implied, but very little is actually seen. This entire film almost plays more like a fairy tale which adds to the timeless nature of the material. It also helps that there are moments of humor even in the most dire of circumstances.

The two children who play Oskar and Eli are wonderful in their roles and quite expressive as well. I can only hope that they go on to do excellent work in the future as they are simply mesmerizing here. It actually helps that Lina's true voice was dubbed to make her more androgynous which is an important plot point in the film. Also, because the deeper voice makes her character more interesting and helps convey the wisdom that is well beyond her age, but not her years on this planet. Both actors should be applauded for creating unforgettable characters that we really care about, which instantly puts ""Let the Right One In"" above many of its contemporaries.

Is ""Let the Right One In"" a true classic? I can't really say. It certainly has all the makings of one, however. If anything, it is easily the greatest film ever made whose title comes from the lyric of a Morrissey song.",1383177600,,3283,4.593856655290103

3703648,5,B001MYIXAW,"This Swedish vampire drama (I do not consider it a horror film) is an absolute MASTERPIECE! Below more of my impressions, with very limited SPOILERS.

Oskar is a gentle (in fact maybe a little too gentle) 12-year old boy living with his divorced mother in Stockholm suburbs. Bullied at school and a loner by nature, he likes to stay late outside - alone, if he can help it. One evening he meets there Eli, who appears to be a girl roughly the same age as he. Eli is very pale, very calm and a little bit odd - but from the beginning ""she"" seems to like Oskar. A lot. This is the beginning of this amazing film, and of the rest I will say no more.

This is a slow moving film, ultimately without much action - but I guarantee that you will not feel the 114 minutes of this movie! At the end, far from being bored, I really regretted that there is not more of it...

This also is a somehow disturbing film, which was even censored by removing some scenes to be allowed for TV distribution in USA. It was adapted from a 2004 novel, which is much more disturbing - in fact it is absolutely abject - so even the Swedish producers changed the story a lot, to be even allowed to distribute this film in the theaters. But even with changes it is a film only for those 18 or above!

This film respects most of vampiric cannon (do not expect vampires walking under the sun here, etc.) although not necessarily all of it - the question of crosses and holy water is carefully avoided...

This film is so good, that even its American remake ""Let me in"" was very honest, even if of course it couldn't beat the original.

I will stop here to avoid any temptation of giving more spoilers. I absolutely ADORED this extremely dark and ambiguous tale and I recommend it with enthusiasm! Enjoy!",1382486400,,1774,4.312312312312312
3703649,5,B001MYIXAW,"I am so weary of the rapid-fire action and fleeting images; but under Tomas Alfredson's direction, this story of a young boy who befriends a strange girl, seemingly of his own age, unfolds slowly and with deep emotion. Alfredson gives viewers time to focus on the scene, savor the moment, and to reflect upon our feelings. Not something you find in every vampire tale nor, indeed, in most of today's films... but something I enjoy very much. This one earned a 5 out of 5 from me. In addition I also recommend the book and the soundtrack to this film.",1381881600,,550,4.51

3703655,5,B001MYIXAW,"I read the reviews in Rotten Tomatoes and one of the reviewers mentioned this version, and thought it was better, and urgently recommend to see the original.  I borrowed (library) both.  I watched this one on one night and the American copy the next.  While the American one has more to the story, I thought it was really poor.  I truly don't understand why people prefer that one.  This version was touching and the chemistry of the main characters were genuine.

The American version, I thought that there was no real chemistry, and they and the dialog was like cardboard.  The CGI (which this version has none) was terrible.  And in one part of the movie Oscar grabs a pole to take care of a bully and the bully calls it a stick!  Another thing (spoiler)they continually focus on the girls' bare feet, to show her resistance to the snow/cold.  There is more I could say.

I know this is supposed to be a review on Let The Right One In and not remake, and not to review as to what it's not... I watched this movie again and got more out of it, especially the sound track which really sets the tone and heart of Eli and Oscar's relationship; both being outcasts of society (she is after all, a vampire)who find strength and worth in their friendship.  This version isn't as gory and in your face, over the top as the American version - which I guess appeals to that audience).  But if you like foreign films, or indy, or who enjoys the classics and likes a good story, then this is for you.  And get the soundtrack, it's really good.

Also, the dubbing was done very well.  I didn't know it was dubbed until after I watched it.  Maybe I was too engaged in the story.",1379980800,3,1667,4.3603896103896105

Twelve year old Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is a shy weakling who lives in a small apartment building with his divorced mom in the winter of 1981. Soon, a mysterious, pale 12 year old cutie named Eli (Lena Leandersson) moves in next door. They initially aren't friends because they're both loners and, besides, she ""smells funny."" It soon becomes clear that Eli's ""father's"" main purpose is to kill people and bring her fresh blood. Eli is a vampire! But Eli hates living on blood and yearns for normalcy. She becomes increasingly attached to the lovable Oskar, and becomes his unobserved protector...which is great because three bullies at Oskar's high school seem intent upon imparting serious injury to him. Will Oskar discover Eli's secret? What will happen between them? Will Eli get caught? This action-packed movie is more than a horror story.

I read a review that said this original film was so much better than the American remake called simply Let Me In because the reviewer said it was more subtle than the remake.  That actually is true to the maximum degree!  THIS MOVIE IS SO SUBTLE IT CAN PUT YOU TO SLEEP!  Only rarely do I not watch a movie to the bitter end but I had to turn this one off after the bats started flying around.  I was actually so surprised how long it took for the blonde boy to ask the vampire girl to go steady.  What happened before that is simply a blur.

3703663,5,B001MYIXAW,"I wish there were more movies like this.  ...Ofcourse there is one (The remake ""Let Me In"") ...Both are excellent. ..And both are worth seeing many times.

If I could only own one, I would choose ""Let Me In"". ..Chloe Moretz may be the most talented and charismatic young actress I've seen in my life. ..In comparison, the interaction between the boy and vampire girl seems less natural in this movie. ..In many scenes both the girl and the boy seem frozen and stiff with unnatural expressions and movements.

The vampire attacks in ""Let Me In"" are vicious. In this movie, they are tame, slow, and non-graphic. But neither movie is a gorefest. Both are excellent dramas with a unique vampire theme.

The most glaring weakness of ""Let The Right One In"" is the english dubbing (it's terrible). ..I prefer watching with the original swedish soundtrack and using the english subtitles. This movie also looks very dated. ..If I had not read the 2009 release date, I would have guessed it was a movie from the 60's.

10 Star System: I would give ""Let Me In"" 10 Stars and ""Let The Right One In"" 7 Stars. ..Chloe Moretz (""Let Me In"") is clearly the more talented actress. ..I couldn't resist buying both movies. ..I watch movies non-stop, and I rarely see anything as good as these.",1374624000,2,1273,4.615044247787611
3703664,5,B001MYIXAW,"Let me start off by saying I actually saw let me  in before reading the book or viewing  let the right one in. I loved let me in the atmosphere mood music the  performances made it one of my new favorite movies  but it seems more of a dark fairy tale about vampires who happen to be kids, I put off watching let me in figuring I would not like it as much, after getting a brief hearing of elis theme on the radio one day on a classical station on the radio peaked my interest into opening my copy of let me in on blu-ray which sat sealed for some time.  I opened and watched... I loved it mabey even a little more than the american remake,  the actrees who played eli was as good or better then the one who played abby (motez) oskar was as good as his let me in counterpart.  I thought the score was incredible for let me in and bought it after seeing the film, once again I was shocked at how the score for let the right one in was  even more memorable in parts... a toss up.  I truly loved both films and if I had to and I mean had to Id pick the swedish version over all but it would depend on my mood unlike everyone else I find them to be  complimentary to each other,  am I in the mood for owen and abby or eli and oskar.  Two movies that have had a profound effect on me.  While Im not a huge fan of the vampire craze these two are movies are  about a sad  sweet relationship mixed with horror out of the need for survival,  that happens to involve a vampie and a normal 12 year old kid (you really need to see it to understand)  buy both movies debate them,  they are not at odds with each other and both can be enjoyed and also both scores are worth owning. Incredible films incredible book. The deeper themes in let the right one in are lonliness isolation and pedophilia which are hinted at in the movie ELI never had a childhood  and her meeting with oskar gives her that chance, soem have gone to say the movie is an allegory of the horrors of pedophilia, and this may not be far off, this is the major difference between let me in and let the right one in for me let me in is a dark sweet sad fairy tale about vampire who is a child... let the right one in is a dark sweet fairy tale allegorey about a child whos not or may have never been a child and is all the more sad and heartwrenching my favorite movie and it stays with you long after u see it.",1374537600,2,2365,3.951476793248945

3703678,5,B001MYIXAW,"'Let the right one in', a vampire tale from Sweden seemed to come out of nowhere recently. Since appearing on dvd and this site(available for instant viewing), there has been a lot of praise for it as something of a special horror film. It seems to impress many people who see it far more than they expect. This is one of those horror films that comes along that really stands on it's own. Well acted, well directed, unique, moody, atmospheric, and truly horrfying in it's simplicity. 12 year old Oskar is an outcast. A frail young boy who get's picked on by his school mates. He befriends a strange girl named Eli. He is emmediately enamored by her and desires to be her friend. He finds her to be a strange girl who seems to not be effected by the harsh cold conditions of the snowy landscape, and seems rather comfortable in light clothing in such harsh conditions. He finds this of interest as he does many other odd attributes about her. At first she tells him he cannot be her friend, but they connect none the less. Eli spends her days in an apartment that has it's windows covered over. Murder victims begin to appear in the town, and a witness of one murder claims that a young girl had attacked the victim viciously. Before long Eli is in danger of her dark secret being discovered. Oskar begins to discover what dark secret Eli is hiding. They grow closer and protect one another as the film progresses. This movie is the most original and engrossing vampire tale to be made in a long time. After two viewings so far, I am compelled to think it may be one of the best, if not the best vampire movie ever made. A superb production that deserves to be noticed.

3703689,5,B001MYIXAW,"I was intrigued about this movie by its synopsis, and after reading others reviews was reluctant.  Dove in and watched it, WOW.  I've never written a review for a movie before, but goddamned.  What a treat this movie was.

Spinning the typically bloodly and creepy vampire on its ear, this movie was so much more about the pain that is the vampire life.  Told from a young boy bullied at school, who at first found a true friend, and then an adolescent sexual curiosity leading to true love, this was simply WOW.

The cliched glamour of vampires is stripped to the core with this film, as you are prevy to the dark, underside of the life sustained by blood.  Reality is a ""no-holds barred"" element, with small doses of human emotion fed to the audience throughout.

Look, I'm a fan of horror films for the shock, scare and fear value with a ""slight"" penchant for zombie acalyptic genres.  But this movie, was quite possibly one of the BEST movies I've seen in some time.

You, the audience, develop a genuine feeling of compassion, sympathy and outright love for the young gal vampire in this movie.  The close up of her eyes at the very end, brought genuine adoration, and the simple blink of her eyes sent me straight over the edge of emotion with a ""cliched"" tear from my eye, and big smile of joy on my face.

For those interested in horror, there is no shock/gore/japanese spider wall-climbing to be fouund.  But for those who enjoy the genre, this WILL tug at anyone's heart strings as this movie has a spin that I've never seen, nor could conceive of.

3703694,4,B001MYIXAW,"These movies are sort of difficult to rate.  On one hand both tell a compelling story, are fairly well acted, and have satisfying conclusions.  On the other hand neither are really scary- at all.  The jump scares that are put in do not induce any fright and very little reaction.  So here is my problem.  Which trumps in this situation?  To help break this down I will examine each against each other, because I do feel that one is the superior movie.  I'll come out and say now that I prefer Let the Right One In, which is the original Swedish film.  The subject matter dealt with in both of these films is difficult for any actor, let alone children.  Both movies are well directed and reveal how the director was approaching the source material, which I will admit I am unfamiliar with.  Going by the films alone I think much of this is going to be personal preference in the end.  I'll begin with the tones of the films.  The Swedish version plays up the innocence in the main character, Oskar.  Throughout the film he has a real naivet about him that never leaves, whereas Owen in the American version has much more anger.  This speaks to the sensibilities of the countries in which they were made.  In the States there are very few characters cut from Oskar's ilk anymore.  We want our protagonists strong and willing to fight, Oskar is not this.  Even in the scene where he does fight back, it is very subdued.  When the main antagonist begins bleeding from the ear I was genuinely shocked because it barely looked like he was hit.  I was expecting Oskar to hit him with the pole, have little effect, and still have the snot beat out of him.  It wasn't important how hard he hit, just that he did.  Owen, though, wants to cause pain.  He is angry and feels helpless and this fuels his rage.  It doesn't help that we feel less for the antagonist in the American version.  Neither versions have this character fleshed out, other than a brief mention of him being bullied in the home.  This backstory in itself bothers me because it is so cliche.
Another stark difference between the two characters comes when we are first introduced to them.  Oskar is seen in his room with a large knife acting out the famous 'You talkin' to me' scene from Taxi Driver.  We can see that this is the kind of guy he wants to be- someone who is strong and unafraid.  Owen has a similiar moment when we meet him.  He also has a large knife, but he is acting just like his bully, using the same words that are used on him.  He does not want to be someone who is strong and unafraid, but he wants to inflict his pain on others.  There is a real sense that if he were in the bullies position he would not hesitate to torture another person.  I think this makes him less sympathetic as a character.
The other important part of this film is the character of Eli/Abby.  Here it is harder to differentiate.  Both actresses play the character in a very similiar matter.  Both are terrible at being vampires in the sense that they do not have any subtlty or stealth in their attacks.  The Swedish version does not has quite as much on-screen with Eli in vampire form as the American version.  This again goes back to the sensiblities of the countries they were targeting.  Other than that both are done well, though I do still feel that the Swedish version comes out ahead.  The characters killed seem to have more reason to be killed rather than just being there at the time.

Overall both of these moves are good.  If I had to rate them I would put Let Me In at 3 while Let the Right One In is 3.5.  Both tell good stories, but neither are really scary.  Worth watching if you like a good tale with some subtitles.",1362960000,,3692,4.359765051395008

3703696,5,B001MYIXAW,"You just wanna hug Eli, throw her in a hot soapy tub with instructions to not come out until she's really squeaky clean - including those blood encrusted fingernails, young lady - and for god's sake, stop killing the neighbors, you adorable little sociopath.

This quiet, addictive movie is marvelous on so many levels.  And it's as faithful to the novel as a standard length movie can be.

To sum up, if you're fed up with excessively glamorized depictions of vampires as trivialized by Twilight and adaptations of Ann Rice novels, fear not: Let The Right One In is not in that tepid vein.  It is closer to the grotesque humor and pathos of Coppola's ""Dracula"" with Gary Oldman (minus the lavish production and campy melodrama), and to the marvelously cynical ""Shadow of the Vampire"" with Willem Dafoe.  Eli is even closer to Dexter, the blood-obsessed tries-to-be-a-good-guy serial killer, than to the typical vampire.  More than just an offbeat vampire movie, it's equally at home in the genre of morality fiction alongside ""Lord of the Flies"" as a commentary on childhood bullying and the tribal nature of societies at all ages.

Like Dafoe's ferret-faced, anti-glamorous alternative to the familiar suave caped invader cliche, Leandersson's vampirette has not only ""forgotten how to feel cold"", she's also forgotten to bathe or wear clean clothes.  Sometimes she doesn't even bother to wear shoes in the snow.  Even after she bathes - prompted by Oskar's ""You smell funny"" quip - pay close attention to Eli's hands.  Like any unsupervised pre-adolescent tomboy, she doesn't bother with trivialities like cleaning her fingernails.

I probably watched this movie a dozen times while it was available via Amazon Prime's streaming video, including several viewings each of the ""correct"" English subtitled version, and the English dubbed version.  My initial reaction to Eli was ""You manipulative little bitch!""  But after second and third viewings the breathtaking nuances of Lina Leandersson's interpretation won me over.  If she never acts again she's accomplished an incredible range of subtle expressions normally seen only in much more experienced young actors.  Without special effects, simply through her odd, puppy-dog-cute face with that too-big nose and ridiculously huge anime eyes and crooked smile, she alternates between simple childlike affection in most scenes with Oskar, to appearing haggard and burdened by too many decades of pitiable existence (notably in the Rubik's Cube and ""uninvited"" scenes).  Oskar (Kre Hedebrant) is equally adept at conveying joy, sorrow and the resigned mantle of the victim through subtle facial expressions.

Regarding criticisms from other fans about the subtitled and English dubbed versions:

First of all, Amazon streaming video has the correct English subtitles by Ingrid Eng.  This version most accurately conveys the subtleties of the dialog, which is quite minimal, often ironic or gently sarcastic.  I have no idea whether the currently available DVD from Magnet has been corrected to include the original subtitles.

Secondly, the English dubbed version on Amazon isn't 100% faithful to the Ingrid Eng translation but is close enough.  There were a couple of notable deviations but nothing significant enough to spoil the experience.  For example, Hkan's apology is translated as ""I'm sorry"" rather than the nuanced ""Forgive me"" that is echoed throughout the film by other characters.  Forgiveness, rather than sorrow, is one of the central themes to LtROI.  And Eli's childlike scrawled notes to Oskar are not translated, either in captions or voiceover.  Eli's notes are quite touching so fans will want to Google around for that bit of trivia.

But overall the spoken translations are faithful, including Eli's sarcastic ""jungle gym"" reply to Oskar in their first scene together.

And the English speaking voices of the kids are very well suited to the actors.  In particular voice actress Robin de Lano's voiceover for Eli perfectly conveys the darker, huskier vocal qualities the director wanted in the Swedish language original.  Trivia buffs will recall that Lina Leandersson's voice was overdubbed as well in the original Swedish language version to achieve a lower pitched, somewhat less overtly feminine character.  When comparing both it's remarkable how well the English speaking actress conveys Eli's personality, with her nuances of weary ennui and moments of awkward childlike enthusiasm.

So, purists for the Ingrid Eng translation should be satisfied with the English dubbed version, which may be a better way to introduce this excellent movie to folks who dislike subtitles.

Without venturing too far into spoilers regarding the sexuality and orientations of the various characters, if I could find any fault in the movie, it may be that an opportunity was missed to comment on the story's core: It's about the nearly unsolvable puzzle of relationships, a bit of irony in itself since puzzles - one of Eli's fascinations - are visual themes scattered throughout the movie.  However, since the author of the novel also wrote the screenplay and had final say on story elements he considered essential, it's probably safe to say that the sexual identities of these two 12 year olds - even the 12 year old who's been 12 years old for a very long time - matter less than the fact that these two misfit puzzle pieces simply found each other.",1362873600,,5414,5.220809248554914

3703699,5,B001MYIXAW,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It's fundamentally a story about vulnerability, and desire.  It's also a meditation on the meaning of violence, and what exactly it means to be human. That one of the main characters happens to be a vampire that looks like a 12 year old girl, well.. That's the twist that makes it so crazy good.  This story plays no ""twilightesque"" games with the canonical attributes of vampirism, which is one of the reasons it's so riveting.  Vampires are like anti-superheros in that they have superhuman attributes, but what makes them interesting is their weaknesses. They move amongst humanity, appearing to be human, but in fact are an insatiable alien parasitical force that must skulk in actual darkness, fearing the light and human attention- for while they are strong, a vampire is also very vulnerable to exposure, which literally burns.

So the title has several meanings: Eli, the girl vampire must of course according to the canonical vampire rule be invited into a home before she can enter.  But she is also searching for a human servant to invite into her world; to move for her in daylight, be her go between with human society, and to help gather her food.  Oscar, the boy she develops a relationship with, is also very vulnerable, a lonely and sensitive 12 year old boy who is ignored by adults and bullied at school.  They both are seeking someone to invite in, to address their respective longings and weaknesses.

Oscar (and his predecessor, now an old man in this film, but once a young boy just like Oscar is in the film's 1970's Sweden) of course responds to Eli as if she were human.  And this is the deepest tragedy of the film.  The film plays with us, too, on that level - because we all respond emotionally to her as if she were a 12 year old girl, when she is in fact a monster playing our perception of her to her advantage. The question of how much ""she"" actually feels this, and regrets the loss of her humanity, is one of the most compelling questions here.  I think the movie manipulates us a bit on that score, or really lets Eli manipulate us, because when you step back and think about it, the only truly sane human response would be to put a stake through her heart.  That's what makes this story so transgressive - it taps our humanity and plays it, making us feel affection for a monster who does not deserve it.  Oscar, and Eli's older servant whom Oscar replaces, become complicit in her inhumanity, her monstrousness.  In so far as we sympathize with them, we become monstrous, too.

My only criticism of the story's logic, which as I say is amazing, is that you have to accept that a vampire like Eli could exist for a couple centuries (apparently she's been a vampire for 200 years, a fact not mentioned in the movie, but in the book that inspired it) in a country the size of Sweden (and I suppose Norway and maybe Denmark) behaving essentially as a brutal - and rather obvious - serial killer, without attracting any undue attention, and getting caught and destroyed.  Not sure that's really credible, unless there's something about her that we do not know, that perhaps she also speaks Russian or German and has been hiding in places other than Scandinavia during that time.

That quibble aside, I think this movie is one of the best of the last decade, and a true classic.  The American remake starring Chloe Moritz is almost as good, being an interesting refraction of the story.  Both worth your time, if you find the grotesque gripping at all.",1362096000,,3532,4.585055643879174
3703700,5,B001MYIXAW,"My personal favorite vampire movies currently are (in no particular order): ""Let The Right One In"" (Swedish), ""Let Me In"", (American/English language version), ""Near Dark"" and ""The Forsaken"".  I guess this means my taste is sanguinary cinema is a bit off-the-beaten-path, and also that I like my vampire movies to either take place in the desert or in a snowy, wintry climate.  :)

Anyhoo, to get the to film(s) at hand:  Let The Right One In is probably one of the best foreign-made horror films in many a year and puts a completely new spin on vampire lore.  it focuses on young Oskar, and frail, pale, blond-haired boy (he's Swedish, after all) who is miserable at school due to daily bullying and out of touch with his currently separated parents.  He fantasizes about violently defending himself against his schoolyard tormentors, making verbal threats and stabbing inanimate objects such as trees with a knife.  One night he meets a girl who appears to be his age who calls herself ""Eli"".  Eli is a strange little cookie who has used newspaper to black out the windows of the apartment she now lives in, does not dress for cold weather and even goes outside barefoot in the snow, and smells as if she does not make a regular habit of bathing.  The two strike up a strange friendship/budding preadolescent romance.  But, as we  soon learn and Oskar leans soon after, she is a vampire, and not a ""she"" at all in the truest sense of the word but a boy whose own attack by a vampire was so brutal that is resulted in castration.  (Eli her/himself tries to kill his/her victims after feeding, having no desire to create more vampires).

Oskar accepts Eli for what (s)he is, Eli encourages him to stand up for himself (in other words, not to just imagine fighting back against bullies but to do it for real), and Eli needs a replacement for her current human accomplice/caretaker, who has become incompetent in his duties of getting blood for her, you see where this is going?

Arguably, the ending is ambiguous:  is Oskar to be Eli's next accomplice?  Can/will Eli change him so they can live together forever as a couple of child/vampires?

This is a beautifully acted/photographed film, with the bleak snowy landscape somehow appropriate.  The same can be said for ""Let Me In"", the Americanized/English language version, which in my opinion is the equal of the original Swedish in every respect.  I highly recommend both and certainly think they both make a good edition to any vampire cinema fan.

Did not like it.

Part of the problem is the name ""Let the Right One In"".  I was expecting a climactic choice between opposing entities, based on the need to give permission for a vampire to cross a threshold.  Instead, after a slow Swedish build-up, which I don't have any problems with, the movie ended.

There are three subplots with surprising little interaction between, or drama within them.  Eli the vampire needs a new keeper.  She disposes of the old one and acquires a new one with little fanfare.

The neighbors disappear like 5 little indians, with only a limp attempt to fulfill one of the great slasher film cliches, ""take on the monster alone and die"".  Both plots are greatly facilitated by the utter lack of police presence in the face of a series of macabre murders.

And a revenge fantasy where poor little Oskar finally stands up to the school bullies armed only with a sheath knife and a homicidal vampire bff.  Again, driven by a complete lack of authority figures and some grossly overdrawn delinquents.

Since the whole movie centers around Oskar I was sucked into cheering for him and his romance with Eli, then felt completely manipulated when he evolved into the most sociopathic turd of the pile.  It's not clear whether the director intends to condemn vengeance (""capital punishment is completely unacceptable in a society of laws"") in stereotypical Swedish ""neutrality"" fashion, or if it's a parody of that, or if he simply wanted to gussy up his vampire trash with some Euro deep thought.  My money's on the latter.

Based on reviews by those who read the book, I get the feeling some of the themes got lost in translation.  The neighbors were apparently drunks and perhaps less sympathetic victims than in the film. And the father's drinking problem is so low key that US audiences read the subtext as homosexuality.  Of course, with Jocke and Lacke's mooning about and the nature of Eli's 12 year old immortality, I'm surprised no one has decided this is an extended metaphor about AIDS...

To sum up, nothing much of consequence happens, there is no one to cheer for, but it takes two hours for this dismal parade to conclude.",1354492800,,2329,4.706172839506173

3703717,3,B001MYIXAW,"I'm not big on vampires in general. Movies, books, shows...and none of it has to do with the recent Twilight explosion. They've just never interested me even the slightest. I'll still give a book or movie featuring them a chance if it sounds good enough, or at least sounds unique. The plot summary for Let the Right One In sounded pretty good when I first read it a few years ago. When I watched the movie then, I thought it was ok. Watching it again now, I feel the same. I honestly can't see what all the hype is about with it. Let the Right One In has some good qualities, but moves way too slowly and doesn't shed much light on a couple of plot points, while choosing to go off track with an underwhelming sub-plot. You could take at least 20 minutes out of this movie and have something much better. Apparently, the book was more solid and had answers for all the questions. It's too bad they didn't stick closer to it.

Set in the 1980s, Let the Right One In is the story of a young boy, Oskar, who is a loner if there ever was one. He's always picked on at school by a couple of other boys, doesn't have any friends to play with, and merely practices telling off the bullies while stabbing a tree with a small knife. His parents are divorced too, and he lives with his mom in an apartment. One day, new neighbors move in next door- an older man named Hakan and a young girl named Eli. We quickly learn that Eli is a vampire, and Hakan more or less works for her, killing people and draining their blood into containers. Oskar doesn't catch on to this, seeing her as just another kid and, more importantly, his friend. Eli gives him courage, little by little, and he becomes more confident. He just might do something about those bullies at this rate. At the same time, Hakan screws up big time during a blood run, when he forgets to take the blood from the scene of the crime. Eli doesn't take this very lightly. Meanwhile, a small group of people in a cafe begin to make something of the murders, and one guy goes nuts when a friend of his becomes a victim.

Oskar and Eli's relationship is very believable [for what it is] and cute. Seeing this quiet little loner kid asking her questions about herself and teaching her things like what a Rubik's Cube make up some of the best scenes in the movie. The poor kid doesn't have much going on in his life and she's just what he needed. Kare Hedebrant does a fantastic job as Oskar and whenever he was having moments of joy, I couldn't help but smile a little. I was equally impressed by most of the special effects in the movie looking as good as they do. There's very little CG work here and any time Eli would climb a wall or go into turbo mode, it looked great. When someone was cut or bitten, blood didn't blast all over the place either. When it came down to it, I was more interested in the characters themselves than I was with what was going on with the movie. And for what it's worth, I'm glad they didn't overdo it with the vampire bits, though you may need to know a little bit about them before watching this. Just look at the name of the movie- I didn't know anything about that until just a few months ago!

My problem is that Let the Right One In drags on for far too long. Numerous scenes go on for longer than they should thanks to long periods of silence and nothing happening. Look, I'm not the kind of guy that drinks Monster and needs constant action. Heck, one of my favorite movies is There Will Be Blood. But I was getting a little jittery while watching this one, almost to the point of fast forwarding through a few parts. Instead of having no one say anything, why not give us a little more dialogue to flesh out the characters? I understand that keeping things to a minimum might make what the characters say seem a little more important, but they don't say a whole lot as it is. That's part of why I wanted to learn more about Eli. The other big problem I have is the sub-plot with the cafe people. Lacke is the main guy of the group, and his friend Jocke get killed by Eli when she needs blood. We never learn anything about Jocke, and every now and then the movie switches over to Lacke going crazy over his death for a couple of minutes. Later on, something happens to another person in the group (involving cats and stairs), and it's so silly that you can't help but laugh out loud when you see it play out. But...it's supposed to be a serious scene and contribute to Lacke's sadness. To me, this whole portion of the movie is so tacked on and barely has any payoff. I never cared about Lacke or his friends. They're tacked on. I hear this section is much bigger in the book. Maybe I'll read it and see how much better everything with it is.

There's more I could talk about but I don't want to go too far into the details. Let the Right One In is worth watching, though I can't recommend more than a rental. I'll probably check out the book sometime, or go with the remake that came out not too long ago to see how they handled things there.

The stars in both films were a credit to their profession, and so young at that to have mastered such talent.

This is a different kind of horror film. Its slower moving so that you can become apart of the characters feelings.  It has moments of sensitivity and of course the horrible nature of how a young girl survives.

I am not crazy about reading subtitles but MOST movies are much better in the original language. Dubbed movies just don't have the same emotion and can't match the subtle nuances.

The snow-filled landscape is the most gorgeous this side of FARGO, and LET THE RIGHT ONE IN has a lot more than atmosphere going for it. In the end it's a coming of age story about twelve-year-olds, and one of the most interesting things to me is how Eli, the vampire ""girl,"" *is* a child, regardless of whether she's been around for decades or centuries (it's never made clear how long she's been a vampire). Eli is emotionally on Oskar's level, and at best, she has a little knowledge over Oskar, with insight to recognize that she kills out of necessity whereas Oskar's homicidal tendencies are rooted in being bullied and the desire for vengeance. The morality is even further complicated since Eli, who kills out of need, chooses innocent victims, as opposed to the bullies who are the focus of Oskar's homicidal fantasies (who are also, after all, just kids -- shitty kids, but kids). Oskar's ease of walking through doors, as he does repeatedly through the movie, is contrasted with Eli, who must be granted permission before she can do the same. This pays off when Oskar bullies Eli into entering without permission, and in this movie rules are there for a reason. (We also see Oskar, many times appearing almost ghostly, as a reflection in windows and mirrors; not so for Eli.) When Oskar sees the consequence of Eli's transgression, it doesn't matter that she's a vampire, he deeply cares for her, and she for him. The audience's bloodlust is paid off in a vicious and shocking way at the end (pay attention to the bully marching in place, as his legs continue to march as Eli drags him through the pool). Eli and Oskar's relationship is both touching, and in its implications for the future, frightening.

Oskar, a bullied young boy befriends Eli, a strange perculiar girl who turns out to be vampire. With Eli by his side, Oskar finds love and the courage to stand up to his tormentors. All seems sweet until Eli starts feeding on the locals.

Is it any good?

Rarely does a horror movie come along that is both beautiful and horrific; `Let the Right One In' is one of those rare gems. Set in Stockholm in the 1980's, most of the action centers around an apartment block during a snowy winter. This dark snowy atmosphere is captured brilliantly by director Tomas Alfredson; mixed with stunning cinematography, the snow brings a sense of confinement which congeals with the children's cold identities. It's in the acting that this movie really shines; leads Hedebrant (Oskar) and Leandersson (Eli) are equally compelling. Oskar is brilliantly vulnerable while Eli is sweet, creepy and terrifying. `Let the Right One In' is a must for any horror fan; it is romantic, disturbing, tender, highly original and chilling; a true masterpiece.

Best bit?

When Oskar refuses Eli an invitation inside his apartment she enters anyway; the result will leave you haemorrhaging!

3703731,5,B001MYIXAW,"""Beware Spoiler ahead""
If you read the book, this is the version you have to watch, because it's most faithful to the book unlike ""let me in"". I don't mean by that Let me in is inferior. It's just different; more like an adaptation of the movie ""let the right on in"" instead. If you watch both movie you'll notice that even the shots are similar, but like mirrored.
Let's talk about the differences:
1. ELI/ ABBY
Let's talk about gender. In the book, Eli is a boy and Let the right one in ""shows"" that Eli is a boy.
Abby in Let me in, you never get to know that she is a boy. She only says that she is not a girl, but it goes more into letting the audience know that she is a vampire creature. We have to conclude that she is in fact a girl.
Eli is sad, looking for someone, a companion to his loneliness.
In let me in, Abby is definitely looking for a blood provider. Abby's blood providers hate what his doing,
On the other hand, Eli's Blood provider Hackan loves Eli. He asks for forgiveness as he fails to provide blood.
Abby's one don't. He just complains about being sloppy and getting tired of it. He wants to get caught.
Vampire look: Eli is described as the book and Abby looks ""EVIL"", a demonic face.
When Eli kills her first victim and snaps his neck, she feels sad. Abby just snaps it and goes away.
Abby mostly walks bare foot in the snow. Eli walks bare foot only once. I had problems with that because that would raise suspicious if anyone could see Abby at night walking.

2. OSKAR /OWEN
Oskar and Eli's relationship are more believable. Oskar is a bullied boy, just like Owen.
The thing is that you can see that Oskar likes collecting pieces of newspaper with murderers, crimes...When he hits Jonny with a stick; he enjoys it if you look at his face expression. Owen is petrified after hitting Jimmy.
When Lacke goes into Eli's Apartment to kill him, Oskar pull his knife, he was about to perform his first kill. Owen on the other hand again, scared. Oskar just close the door, Owen walks away covers his ears, afraid.
In Let Me In,Lacke and the other drunks were replaced by a cop.
Lacke was going to get Revenge against Eli for biting Virginia's Neck. Let me in, the cop goes in without a warrant, breaking in Abby's apartment.
Virginia's was replaced by a random woman that lives' in Owen's block.
3. Blood Provider.
Hackan in Let the right one in is a Pedophile, that part was avoided in the film and in Let Me in too. I can understand why it was left out.
It is not described how Hackan and Eli ended up together but you can probably think he was looking for boys/girls.
Abby's blood provider can be seeing in the picture in her apartment. Abby in the picture look exactly the same and his blood provider around 12 years old. You can deduct that Owen will replace him.

That is were the biggest difference between both movies, Eli looking for companionship in his loneliness. Abby looking for a replacement.
I still don't understand why this movie needed to be remade so soon. It was already perfect. The pace is better in Let The right one in. It gives mystery to the whole situation. In let me in, fast forward to the Blood Provider being transported to the hospital. I mean Let Me In jumped straight into the action. To me, Matt Reeves looked like he didn't read the book or didn't understand it while filming Let Me In.

As a fan of both international films and the horror genre, I bought this on a whim and put it aside to watch when I had nothing else to view. Last night I finally played the dvd. I was spell bound by this little gem. First, to label it a vampire movie is an injustice. The themes of friendship, bullys, and first love are far more prevalent than the bloodsucking events. ""Good"" and ""evil"" are shown to be gray areas, so you can't really say if good wins in the end. The vampire feeding episodes are graphic- no romantic bite on the neck, but yet I found myself siding with the vampire. This film points out there is bad aspects in the nicest person and good intent in the foulest creature. I admit I felt no empathy for any of the adult characters. Every adult appeared shallow compared with complexity of the young characters. I loved this movie. If it didn't have the intense feeding scenes I would recommend this to children as a lesson on bullying, friendship, and not judging people who are different.

Both follow the book fairly closely. The difference, to me, is purely a personal one. I like Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under), and he only appears in ""Let Me In"". I also found the portrayal of Oskar in ""Let Me In"" to be much more sympathetic and believable than in ""Let the Right One In"".

Having said all that, you can't go wrong with either movie. If you prefer--or don't mind--reading sub-titles, then you may prefer this version. It is somewhat more faithful to Lindqvist's book in that it shows how Eli came to be what she is.",1328313600,,809,4.322368421052632
3703738,5,B001MYIXAW,"Both the American film ""let me in"" , (Blu-ray : 2010)), and the Swedish film it was a remake of, ""let the right one in"", (DVD: March 10, 2009),  are best understood as diverging branches of the book ""Lt den rtte komma in"" by John Ajvide Lindqvist and translated into English by Ebba Segerberg as ""let the right one in"".

On a superficial level the American film is a sequel of the Swedish film streamlined and made more pretty and simple of point for American audiences. On that level the American film with Chloe Moretz as ""Ally"" and Kody Smit-McPhee as Owen is a motivationally reprehensible but nevertheless surprisingly successful sequel.

But if you understand the basic reality behind the book you can look at both pictures as taking it in different directions in a way that makes them both meaningful in entirely different ways.

To understand what you're watching you have to think about 3 metaphors.

1st, think of the universe is an avalanche of overwhelming situations in which little tiny creatures like human beings are but pebbles in the machinery of inevitable cause and effect.

2nd, think of heartless mother nature in which every creature is justified by the way mother nature is designed that creature to survive. There is no such thing as nice or wrong and simply following your biological imperative.

And the 3rd thing is to understand that if we are lucky and have a little space in our life where we have enough to eat and we are in a place where we have the leisure to develop friendships based on tender emotions and altruism then we live in it like gold fish in a bowl. Such kindness is an accident in the universe and in his brief and so you must enjoy it for what it is, a meaningless glitch of light in darkness.

The reality of Eli (Lina Leandersson) in the book in Swedish movie, and alley as she is called the American film, is that she was a little child murdered by a vampire when she was 12 years old some 200 years previously. She has no sex drive, none of her body organs or brain or any social processes will ever come to her that she didn't already have a 12. She has lived by feeding on people and it must've destroyed several thousand innocent lives over the years.

In all 3 portrayals of that girl is understood that she is grooming the new boy to replace the old man in her life. The likelihood that after 200 years of killing the special charm of meeting a new young boy is not likely to have awakened her little heart so long conditioned by killing. A sweetness on her part can only be a cold-blooded manipulation.

This is where I think the American movie is more truthful even if it trims more of the story and the context away. The Chloe Moretz version of ""Alley"" is a girl who was always watching your eyes to see if you are buying the lie.

On the other hand, Lina Leandersson version of ""Eli"" is given the many scenes in which she is shown as being genuinely sweet and responsive. I believe this is an intentional misdirection by the director in Sweden. He said in the extras on the DVD that he had no political ideas when making the film. That means that he jettisoned most of the writer's own context for the story. In short, Tomas Alfredson wanted to make a cautionary tale about violence and parental apathy but mostly a timeless Romeo and Juliet story of preteen love. He succeeded. The music and the romance works even though it is an intentional lie. The better film is actually an intentional misdirection.

Perhaps because an American film remake has such low expectations the American director Matt Reeves felt he could tell the harsher story. But it's ironic that the nature of the boy actor as a film presence made the love story even though was a lie a tragedy. The boys knew he was going to grow up to be that other guy. Oscar in the Swedish film really was serial killer in utero. That tragic aspect of the sweetness without illusion presented by Kody Smit-McPhee I think made the relationship deeper because it was so self-consciously a human being going all the way with lying to themselves without being fooled for a moment.

It is maybe a rush to judgment to say that the Swedish film was better, when in one important core way it said what the book said about life.

That little girl is mother nature. You've seen the blood on her face. And she's asking you ""do you still love me?""",1328227200,3,4354,4.481060606060606

After all the hype, I expected much more that the film delivered.  The little girl, Eli, looks like an Italian World War II urchin.  The type that ran behind American tanks asking, ""Hey Joe, you got chocolate?""  Definitely not vampire material.  I never once felt that Oskar had the deep feelings for Eli that Owen displayed for Abby.  I will say that the scene with Virginia and the cats was a shocking mouth-opener.

3703744,5,B001MYIXAW,"Note: This is a review of the film, not the DVD, which, I understand, suffers from poorly translated subtitles.

Let the Right One In (LTROI) is about loneliness, brutality, and love. The brutality of nature, of other humans, and of the world in general is inescapable; but, it can be alleviated by love, which, although it does not completely erase the brutal necessities of nature, relieves the heart of its suffering solitude. Vampires, in this film, are cursed. They do not sparkle in the sun (as in other terrible movies); they are sickly and possess an inveterate need for blood, which painfully requires destroying human life. Eli, the vampire ""girl"" in this film, kills those she feeds from because that spares them the horror of becoming a vampire. Without getting too clever, one can read this movie as an indictment of nature. Eli isn't immoral; however, she is compelled to either destroy or die. She simply has no choice.

Oskar, the film's other main character, is as lonely as Eli. (He is isolated by the brutality of his peers; she, by the brutality of nature.) He and his mother live alone; his father is an alcoholic, and his peers maliciously torture him at school. Violent revenge fantasies play out in his imagination. His face stern, serious, and menacing, he begins to talk to an imaginary tormentor (""are you scared?)"" and then stabs a knife into a tree--the substitute for his tormentor--and yells ""scream...squeal."" But he is not utterly consumed by his fantasies (although they seem to have dangerous potential), and the viewer sees an intelligent and taciturn boy longing for connection. He meets Eli on a sparse, snow covered jungle gym, and they soon bond. At first, she is etiolated and foul smelling because she is starving for blood. A disconcerting grumble can be heard. After she ""eats,"" though, she is healthier and more friendly. The viewer understands why a lonely boy would take to her.

Oskar and Eli's growing intimacy is revealed slowly. In one particularly poignant scene, Oskar buys candy for Eli. Eli says she doesn't want a piece and Oskar ruefully replies ""too bad."" Understanding that her rejection pained Oskar, she asserts that she will try one. She looks at it nervously, almost disgustedly, draws in a breath, and pops the candy in her mouth. In the next scene, she is shown vomiting against the wall of the store. Oskar hugs her; she hardly reacts. Tragically resigned to her fate, she glances unseeing into space and asks Oskar if he likes her and if he would continue to even if she ""weren't a girl."" The scene is perfectly executed--it sadly and subtly illustrates their growing bond. Eli knows the candy will make her ill, but she wants to make Oskar happy, and she wants, in spite of certain knowledge of its impossibility, to be ""human"" for him. When she ineluctably fails--as she knew she would--she hints to Oskar that she isn't what she appears.

Beautifully filmed, LTROI is filled with haunting and poetic shots. There are woods like a Bruegel painting, filled with wasted white trees; solitary apartments, uniform, bland, rising from a field of snow; and intimate faces, pensive, searching for love. The last shot of Eli, in particular, is brilliant. The camera shows her eyes and small portion of her face; it does not show her mouth. She smiles, but one can only tell because of the subtle movement of her facial muscles. In a Hollywood film, the focus would have been her smile. In LTROI, the focus is her eyes and the smile is inferred.

LTROI is a work of poetry. Even the love shared between Oskar and Eli is poetic; it is pure, platonic, unadulterated by petty lust. This is the film's central story. Other stories, although touched upon, are not thoroughly explored. What results is a unified, singular vision that achieves a ""unity of effect"" that is haunting and unforgettable.

Please don't simply take the movie as popcorn fodder. Ask yourself some questions about the true nature of the relationship between Eli and Oskar. Is it an intimate (as possible), friendship or is it a cold and calculated servile relationship in development? My take leans heavily toward the latter.
The English language remake, ""Let Me In"", is incredibly inferior in every respect and only barely worth viewing. The dubbed version of this film is inferior to the sub-titled version and that opinion is from someone who usually finds subtitles annoying at best.

I found it slow and boring and provided no background or answers.  It was impossible to tell how the two kids had a relationship other than from loneliness.

The kiddie porn reference is because the pasty little boy is shirtless in about half of the movie and then there's the gratuitous shot of the girl's naked crotch which was totally unnecessary.  Since she has a 12 year old body forever, no duh that she's going to look like a pubescent kid, a shot of her body wasn't necessary (although I'm sure it wasn't the actress' real body.....one would hope) and added nothing to the film.",1323043200,,746,4.503703703703704

3703750,5,B001MYIXAW,"The following is an explanation as to why I prefer Let The Right one In to Let me In.  Many people think it's pretentiousness to prefer the Foreign film to the domestically made one but really, it's not.  It simply was a bad a film.

1. I don't like the CGI. I see no point in adding blood with CGI. It looks awful.

2. I do not like the implication that the boy is to be the next henchman (or whatever term you want to use). It goes against the original novel and the original theme of rare and true unconditional love without sex. The purist and most innocent love through darkness. That was at the heart of the original story and what made it so endearing.  Also to claim Eli had known her/ his henchman since that henchman was a boy is wrong. He's too bungling and incompetent.  He clearly is not experienced at killing and disposing of the body so how could he have been doing this his entire adult life? That version of the character in the remake does not make sense.

3. The setting of the remake felt wrong. I like atmosphere and I like the unearthly quality of vampires and you lose some of that without the bare footed child in a t-shirt walking in snow and you can't see her breath but you see everyone else's.

4. Making it clear that Eli was really a boy was important because it was the result of that mutilation that Eli was anti-social, avoided human society, was clearly awkward and shunned society with it's gender roles. Eli did not trust the outside world because of his secrets and because of what he suffered and some of that was lost. It takes away from the child vampire's tragedy. And the solidification of the fact that their love was NOT sexual but something far deeper.
  I think it's kind of depressing that we Americans can accept monsters but we can't accept that the child vampire was really a boy?  The fact that being a blood thirsty monster seems ""more acceptable"" to the audience than the idea of the child being a boy says something is really wrong with our society right now.

5. I feel the Swedish actress was simply a better actor in general. The girl who played Abby is now in Dark Shadows and I've been watching interviews with her and she's spacy and acts... well, kind of high...

6. I just tend to prefer films that follow the original source material better.

7. This was the first good vampire film since Twilight. And by ""since Twilight"" I do NOT mean that Twilight is good, but rather the first good vampire film since the whole annoying fad started!

8. The remake disappointed me for another reason as I expect more atmosphere from the recently revived Hammer company and they let me down.

9. I don't like finding out that the reason the title was changed was ""The original title is too long for Americans."" (real reasoning). That offends me. Especially when the original title was based on an English language song by Morrisey and the song definitely suits the movie. And the follow up short story is named for the next line of the song, Let the Old Dreams Die.

  The interpret it that OsKar / Owen (what's the point of changing the name?  We have Oscars here in the US) is the next henchman hurts the film and the entire theme of the movie that love, actual unconditional affection, without need of sex, can bloom in the strangest of situations. That was at the heart of the story. For the boy and for the monster. And if you deliberately strip that out for the sake of your ""interpretation"" the entire message and meaning of the movie is lost just to appease contemporary and cruel cynicism.  It's wrong to completely twist the very heart and meaning of the story to appeal a cold, modern interpretation based on the disturbing fact that people today have become too cynical to accept the notion that love can bloom anywhere at ny time with anyone. The heart of the story was that Oskar could love despite the fact that Eli was a monster and not really female and that Eli would love to a degree of fierce protectiveness she/he never gave to the henchman. To dismiss this and turn the film into something colder and shallow. And to be honest the mindset that does this... disgusts me.

  The writer of the original story said what it's about and wrote a follow up story to prove the way it's supposed to be seen.  He says that Eli eventually makes Oskar a vampire after they finish the blood pact when they get off the train. To act as if he's wrong about the outcome of his own characters is like telling a child they are wrong about their own imaginary friend. That it's not a pink rabbit but rather a green bear.

Kind of nice to see a female (well kind of) sticking up for the boy. The book gives much more details about Eli, and a background that is important to know that might get lost a bit in the film. For instance why she asks Oskar if he would still like her if she wasn't a girl, and a camera shot of her scarred up missing tool box which wasn't the real thing (just an FYI for all the concerned people that was wondering). There's only so much you can put into a movie to make it for the ADD impaired. I don't recommend the movie if you you liked the American remake Let Me In.

3703754,5,B001MYIXAW,"What can be said about this that hasn't already? Let the Right One is a perfect film. It's beautifully shot, has a great story and fantastic performances from its two lead actors Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson. It moves at a somewhat deliberate pace in comparison to your average American horror film, but you will still find yourself engrossed. It's probably one of the best vampire stories I have ever seen, whittling the mythos down to the barest of essentials as well as giving a new twist on the 'rules' (what happens if a vampire enters a dwelling that it was not invited to?). The word 'vampire' is only mentioned once in the entire film. If you're looking for a straight-up horror film you will likely be disappointed, as the film is not particularly scary; the focus is largely on the relationship between the two kids with much of the horrific content happening sporadically. It is however a very haunting and moving experience that you won't soon forget.

The only real criticism I can give it is, as an adaptation of the original book by John Ajvide Lindqvist (who writes the screenplay), it drops the ball on some plot points. In particular, there is one jarring shot that will likely confuse some viewers if they don't know its proper context. Granted, many have been able to pick up on what it means, but there's still a chance that you will be left in the dark. That being said, worse case scenario is that you end up reading the book to understand the film better, which you should either way. Lindqvist still delivers a pitch-perfect script on every other level.

That being said, I would recommend fans import the UK Blu-ray disc from Amazon.co.uk over the US disc. It's region-free, so it will work on any US player. The biggest plus is that it comes with an exclusive commentary track from Lindqvist and director Tomas Alfredson that the Magnolia disc lacks. In addition, it's guaranteed to have the proper subtitles, whereas there's a chance one might still stumble upon an earlier version of the US disc that has the poorly translated ones. Both versions have the deleted scenes, although they're presented in HD with the UK disc and SD in the US disc. If features don't matter to you, the US disc still delivers the film in a high quality presentation in terms of picture and audio, but fans will gain more from the international release.",1317945600,3,2367,4.701204819277108

3703757,5,B001MYIXAW,"Another vampire movie?  Look again.  This is a tragic love story of significant emotional impact. The main characters, Eli and Oskar, combine innocence, maturity, knowledge, violent behavior, touching tenderness, and deep feeling for each other.  They are literally willing to shed their blood for each other.  The sadness felt by the viewer(or reader of the fuller novel) arises from his or her awareness of their tragic future.  Theirs is a love doomed, being unfullfillable sexually and in other normal ways.  Despite this fact, they must remain together because their need for each other depends on their survival. Yes, even in a sense, for Oskar. Will Oskar become another Hakan? We are chilled to consider that. But what is the alternative?  Such is the tragedy.
  Eli's story, as related in the novel, is one of sorrow. There is great poignancy in the meeting of these two.  They fall into each other's lives at the most necessary time for both.
  The performances of both children are outstanding.  Lina Leanderssons's Eli is a performance of heartbreaking naturalness.  Such ""performances"" can probably never occur again as the actor gains in experience and self awareness.  It is a rare thing to behold.  The soundtrack by Soderqvist perfectly expresses this atmosphere of innocence, tenderness, tragedy and foreboding all at once. Eli's theme, with its variations and the use of the acoustic guitar, is one of great melodic beauty.  The cinematography is equally enhancing.  The chill,white cold of the setting wonderfully supports the tragic theme.
  Is it silly to posit such meaning in a work of popular art, especially in one of such a base genre?  Perhaps.  But sometimes we find deep meaning and emotional resonance in surprising places.  I feel this is one. Ultimately it is the viewer or reader that is the key, bringing with him his personal experiences and personality in judging a work of art.  We should acknowledge that the artist can use any vehicle  to create and realize his view of the nature of life. We should not denigrate any form this conception takes but only ask that it succeeds.

3703760,4,B001MYIXAW,"Why would I rent a vampire film? I hate horror films. I don't 'get off ' on the supernatural. I've never been titillated by the sight of blood. None of my best friends are zombies.

But this film comes highly recommended, both the original Swedish production and the American remake. Am I missing something, say I to myself? Is there a metaphysical or psychological depth to the vampire imagery that I ought to probe? Okay, bring it on! Besides, it's in Swedish, my own birth language which I love to hear ...

... and it's an eerily beautiful film, I have to admit. A pellucid love story between a twelve-year-old boy and a twelve-eon-old vampirette. In a sense , it's the same story as that of ""The Makropoulos Affair"", the dark disturbing modern opera by Leos Janacek, the tale of an immortal woman who has outlived both love and her endless succession of mortal lovers. The boy will be one, a mortally aging lover. He will become the tormented 'father' seen haplessly tapping the red sap of victims for his still twelve-year-old 'child' in some bleak snowy future. It's the vampirette Eli's tragedy that we are, I think, to feel empathy for; she knows how dire a life poor Oskar will have until she rewards him with the final sacrament of death. Hay, it's not a bed of roses, being an undying vampire ...

But does it really ""mean"" anything? You tell me. If it's just 'entertainment', why all the symbols, all the aura? This is not a 'scary' movie. Not one at which your girlfriend will gasp and snuggle against your shoulder for comfort. It's actually a pretentious art film ... but not uninteresting in its genre. And now I'm tempted to 'waste' another 90 minutes watching the American remake, just for the sake of cultural comparison.

****
Days later. I did it. I watched the American remake. The comparison of the two is, for me, more interesting than either film by itself. Here's my review of ""Let Me IN"":

And a bloody weird one, too! And an equally weird 'purpose' in my mind in renting it. A few days ago I rented, watched, and reviewed the Swedish film  Lt den Rtte Komma In (Let the Right One Come In). I gave that film a four-star rating; since it is a much better film, I've given this American 'cover' only three stars. But honestly, the ratings are irrelevant. This is not so much a review here and now, but rather a comparison -- thoughtful, I hope -- of the two versions of film-making.

In many ways, the American film simply re-shoots the scenes and re-speaks the script of the Swedish film. But the American film is edited differently; it begins in the middle of the Swedish script and then relies on the good ol' Hollywood flashback tricks. One can't demand Originality in a re-make, logically enough, but it seems to me that the American film discarded much of the Originality of the Swedish film in favor of some Hollywood clichs. The American film is radically gorier than the Swedish. More shocking visually, and less lyrical. It's unreservedly a ""Horror"" film, with lots of moments when the squeamish or overwrought viewer will instinctively look away. The American vampire exhibits more physically vampirish abilities and traits -- more explicit supernatural powers. There's a key comparison: explicit versus implicit! Or: blatant versus subtle, if you will.

The 12-year-old boys are fundamentally different also. The Swedish boy is appealingly vulnerable and potentially ""redeemable"" both morally and psychologically. The American boy is a loathesome little peeping-tom degenerate from the start. The viewer will agonize at the Swedish boy's seduction into evil. The same viewer (me, that is) will expect the American boy to succumb all along.

Perhaps the most startling difference is in the moral contextualization of the story in the two films. The American film is replete with specifically Christian religious symbols and allusions. The action is set in 1983, for the opportunity that time-frame gives of showing Ronald Reagan addressing the nation, over a TV in the background, on the essentially Christian values of America. When those Christian values are disregarded, Reagan tells us, Evil will reign. The boy's mother, in the American film, is a religious enthusiast; her evangelical 'notions' are a chief cause of her marital collapse, as hinted by the unseen father on the telephone to the boy. There's a prominent picture of Jesus Christ on the wall, in the American film, in one of the nastiest scenes. None of this overt Christian context is present in the Swedish film, where unreleased sexuality is more the catalyst than religious hysteria.

So then, is the American film to be understood as an examination of, or assault on, religious frenzy in America? I think it could be taken that way. However, that gets murky very quickly when you remember that a belief in vampires (and other occult phenomena) is profoundly incompatible with Christian theology. A sincere Christian can't possibly accept vampires -- or the emergence of Evil independent of God's Omnipotence -- and therefore the American film explicitly derides Christian certainty as bunk. That's too metaphysically naive and murky for my taste.

The Swedish film raises no theological/metaphysical questions. It's completely and coherently a psychological drama, closer in affect to the poetry of Baudelaire than the spooky tales of Stephen King. It's a ""art"" film, the Swedish one, a portrayal of psychological victimization and obsession, with a tragic ending. As the boy in the American film departs with his vampire friend, one foresees the serial wickedness the pair will accomplish. As the boy in the Swedish film departs, one sees instead the suffering he will experience as the enabler of an eternally deceptive life/blood sucker.",1314576000,3,5750,4.954356846473029
3703761,4,B001MYIXAW,"Let the Right One In is what happens when you mix vampires with Swedes.  The movie is a plodding meditation on coming-of-age for a boy in Sweden and the Swedish vibe soaks the entire film, right down to its color palate. This film is as much about Sweden as it is about vampires.

Claudia in Interview with the Vampire brought about some uncomfortable questions about what happens when a child is turned into a bloodsucking beast. Let the Right One In answered that question: you get a 400-year-old bloodsucking child.

Eli has her own ghoul, a scarred, plodding man who is not very good at bloodletting. His inept attempts force Eli to take increasingly drastic measures, until the whole town is on to her. But not before she befriends the little blonde moppet named Oskar (Kare Hedebrant).
Thing is, Oskar's kind of a freak.  Obsessed with stabbing the bullies who harass him, mouth breathing when he swims (seriously, he seems like he will nearly drown every time he gets in the water), and torn between his attractive but busy mother Yvonne (Karin Bergquist) and his fun but alcoholic father Erik (Henrik Dahl), Oskar doesn't really fit in anywhere.  Until he meets Eli (Lina Leandersson), and suddenly it's clear that they were meant for each other.

Let the Right One In makes a point of keeping their relationship asexual. Eli's appearance varies from sickly to vibrant, depending on how much blood she can drink, which isn't very much. She resorts to ambushing the drunken, sad sack residents of the town, who take quite a long time to rally a defense.

Let the Right On In uses special effects in surprisingly effective ways, with one exception: when cats, who can sense vampires, go on the offensive, they look like bad CGI. But there are other scenes that are pitch perfect and perfectly convey a vampire child in a stark white world.

There's a distinct lack of police presence in this movie. The police are only heard as sirens, never in person. There's no sheriff to speak of. Part of why Eli gets away with as many murders as she does is because there's a plot-induced blindness by law enforcement and medical services.

And yet Let the Right One In is an undeniably creepy vampire movie. It's in part related to the no holds barred conflict between bully and bullied, who increasingly up the stakes until...well, until a vampire has to get involved.  And that never ends well.

American audiences are likely to find Let the Right One In dull and plodding, with occasional moments of brilliance.  I prefer to see it as a distinctly Swedish take on the bloody business of puberty.",1312934400,3,2594,4.74
3703762,4,B001MYIXAW,"Let the Right One In is a recent vampire movie, but it's also one of the better melancholy films I've seen. It's set in a small Swedish town that lies in the shadow of the Iron Curtain and under a foot of snow. Oskar, a withdrawn and bullied 12-year-old, lives in a small apartment with his mother, an unconcerned parent. (In a clichd, but nonetheless poignant, scene, she asks him how he got a cut on his face and unhesitatingly accepts his answer, admonishing him to be more careful on the playground.) Oskar dreams of exacting violent revenge on his tormentors, going so far as to act out scenes with a pocketknife. He also covertly collects newspaper clippings about murders and other grisly incidents. But the most troubling thing about him is his apparent detachment from his predicament. It's not that he's underconcerned or perversely content with being bullied; it's that he responds dispassionately, as if he's come to terms with hopelessness. He doesn't ever run, cry, or raise his voice, even though he's clearly suffering and has been engaged in an internal struggle over whether, and if so when, to strike back. Notably, we have every reason to believe that he regards striking back as the ideal. It is not compassion or an aversion to ""lowering"" himself that stays his hand, but rather something else, such as the inherent gravity of revolutionary action. Perhaps he is also concerned with the physical act of revenge, for he takes up weight training under the tutelage of his amiably eccentric gym teacher.

One night, in the snowfield outside his apartment building, Oskar meets Eli (rhymes with deli), who recently moved in next door. She is also 12, in her words, ""more or less."" Though Oskar maintains his emotional flatness in her presence -- even after she confirms her sanguinivorous nature -- he is obviously fascinated. He begins, shly, to let her in. He tells her about the bullies, and she advises him to hit back. He questions her willingness to kill, and she points out his. Eli and Oskar are both sympathetic characters in that they are constantly victimized by circumstance, but they are not innocent characters. They are both outsiders, but they must confront the conventional world. Naturally, they are drawn together, certain irreconcilable differences be damned. The subsequent plot developments are largely unremarkable, but their execution is wondrous and moving.

Often, the film successfully resonates by economizing on the explicit, in the same way that a lingering shot of a snowscape can say more about doleful desolation than could even a Roy Batty voiceover. For instance, there are two scenes in which I recall Oskar expressing childlike delight in contrast to his usual aloofness: one where he goes sledding while visiting his dad, and another where he and his mom start brushing their teeth in unison and turn to each other with amusement in their eyes, perhaps engaging in a nightly ritual for the thousandth time. These glimpses of realistic domesticity -- a rare treat in film -- flesh out the viewer's psychological portrait of Oskar; they suggest that he is not entirely consumed by his bullying and not always so removed from the viscerality of emotion -- that he _feels_ his pleasure and therefore his pain. In another telling domestic scene, a man arrives while Oskar is hanging out at the dinner table with his dad, and the relaxed mood immediately shifts: Oskar stiffens, and his father, invoking the obligation of hospitality, gets the door and pours a couple of drinks. Oskar quickly leaves, and we are left to wonder what prompted his anxiety. His dad comes across as a genial, easygoing man, but is he a horrible drunk? Is the other man his lover? Was Oskar simply crushed by the disruption of his fragile tranquility? Such moments bow my heart strings as much as the bullying, because they convey the tortuous inner life of a tortured child. And like the wordless scenes of delight, they do so in a way that leaves unnecessary details to the richness of imagination.

Let the Right One In also succeeds atmospherically. From the opening fade-in of a gentle flurry, snow plays a prominent role in the film. Fittingly, there is something about snow that complements the vampiric. Perhaps it is that snow signifies short, dark days. Perhaps it is that in its presence we cling bitterly to the very warmth that the vampire craves. Perhaps it is the lifelessness of a whited-out landscape. Perhaps it is simply our association of cold and death. At any rate, the omnipresence of snow contributes to the town's air of remoteness and repose. There is little vivacity in the dead of winter, and the moonlight, reflected and amplified by the snow, bathes the town in a subdued, blue-tinged glow. Practically, it is hard to argue that a vampire wouldn't be better off in a big city, where victims are anonymous and hideouts are plentiful, but aesthetically Eli has come to the right place. Overall, the film's atmosphere is in harmony with its pacing -- the exposition of important plot developments is unhurried, and the viewer is given time and space to reflect on characters' experiences. Thus, while the film has its share of violent and passionate events, its intensity is never at odds with its contemplative tone.

I am compelled to discuss Let the Right One In's take on vampirism, because a review of a vampire movie isn't worth its weight in blood without such a discussion, and also because the film presents a particularly compelling account. Most significantly, Let the Right One In does not glamorize vampirism. Many vampires, particularly the more recent creations, are charismatic creatures who -- bloodthirst and daylight curfew aside -- have transcended their physicality in the manner of ageless superheroes. We are inclined to envy them, especially in this age of blood banks and limitless indoor stimulation. Not so with Eli, who, in the vein of Nosferatu, elicits an uneasy sympathy. She is trapped in a child's body, so she is limited in her ability to function independently and feed ethically. She possesses preternatural physical prowess, but she is unable to seduce or entrance her victims. When she is underfed, she smells of death. She derives no apparent pleasure from the taking of life. Yet take life she does, wantonly at that, so we cannot comfortably sympathize. She is still childlike in many respects, despite her apparently great age, so perhaps her responsibility is diminished. Indeed, with the selfishness of a child, she has rationalized her murderousness as a need, and is apparently unburdened by the arguable moral imperative to end her life. Moreover, we cannot help but perceive her as a child, for fundamental elements of her identity have been frozen in time. But there is no escaping the fact that she is a serial killer, albeit probably not the first one you've rooted for.

Oskar certainly seems to have few qualms about this fact. After all, he is 12 and troubled, and he is in love, or something like it. But so is Eli. At first, she prudently attempts to dissuade his efforts at friendship, but it is clear that she, too, is suffering from loneliness. (For how long has she endured a life of permanent juvenility, perpetual night, forced seclusion, and desensitized murder?) Soon it is not just Oskar who is opening his heart.

It is wonderful to watch their love unfold, but it is also tragic. The romantic endeavors of 12-year-olds do not ordinarily inspire such gravity, but in this case it feels appropriate. Together Oskar and Eli have found a happiness it seems they had never known, but it is a happiness that cannot last. Oskar will become a teenager, then a man, and they will have to let each other go. But all is not lost if they never regret having let each other in.",1312156800,6,7786,4.890234670704012
3703763,4,B001MYIXAW,"It is a good movie - no doubt.  I love the concept - young vampire.  Her helper at the start has to be the most incompetent person to ever be chosen to take care of a vampire.  That was the funny part (intentional or otherwise).  I do like the idea that you don't actually see a lot of the violence (e.g. the pool scene at the end).  She is one crazy vampire.

The maker does make the parents in this movie seem so out of touch with their kid - with a few exceptions.  And the school administration?  Seriously?  Even here they aren't that daft.  Those were the major down parts.

3703764,5,B001MYIXAW,"I watched ""Let Me In"" and was absolutely haunted by the film. I can't explain why I felt the way I did, but perhaps something in my subconscious is able to relate with it very well. On the other hand, it's also because it was a very well made movie and the characters are what made the film.

So naturally I went on Netflix and watched ""Let The Right One In."" First thing I noticed was the lighting and cinematography. It was brighter and more vibrant. The character Oskar, is played a bit more differently. He's still the tormented and lonely kid, but in here he seems more disturbed than Owen from the American remake. Eli is played differently as well. She seems more like a child here than Abby did. To say the remake is the same as the original would not be accurate.

I found myself watching this version more. I loved the character Eli. I loved how Lina plays her and her little facial expressions here and there gave her a sort of complex and mysterious feel. The music is amazing and emotional. And the Swedish language sounds so cool to me. To see a relationship between two lonely, tormented, and somewhat disturbed characters grow throughout the progression of the movie was very entertaining. Great writing, direction, and acting. I, of course, ended up buying this  movie on bluray from Amazon.

This is the human/vampire relationship story that is on the other side of what we are used to seeing. If Twilight is one side of a coin, then this movie is the other side. Not everyone will connect so well with the movie, but give it a watch and it may haunt you for a long time....trust me.",1311638400,2,1601,4.472602739726027

3703767,4,B001MYIXAW,"I watched Let Me In last night and I have to say that I am very disappointed with the new Hollywood version. Let The Right One In (Swedish film) was so much better for many reasons. First) no matter how you could possibly feel about subtitled foreign films Let Me In did not make up for the minuses of LTROI. Second) I read the book - Wow, that was a crazy book. I watched LTROI - Wow, Swedish Hollywood did a good job for the film adaptation but they left out some stuff. I watched LMI - Wow, Hollywood watered down the story, left out some important parts and totally left the creepy horror elements out. Hollywood, you suck. Third) Character name LTROI/LMI - Oskar/Owen, Eli/Abby, and Hakan/Thomas whole relationship thing is a dark element of the story. Hakan/Thomas takes care of Eli/Abby and that relationship is creepy in many ways. LTROI book tells all, LTROI movie hints at it and shows some of the creepiness of the relationship but LMI barely hints at it. LMI just shows it as the photo of a young Thomas and the age unchanged Abby. Whereas in the Hakan and Eli relationship Eli will reward Hakan in ways that contribute to or have caused his pedophilia ways, the Thomas and Abby relationship only shows Thomas killing and gathering blood for Abby but no hints of pedophilia on Thomas part. Fourth) Am I the only one that thinks this story (be it the book or the movies) does not have a happy ending? Am I the only one that thinks that Oskar/Owen is going to grow up and become the next Hakan/Thomas? To me, LMI paints a better picture that Eli/Abby's modus operandi is to seduce a young person and mold them into a caregiver for her to use for many years if only for the scene of Owen looking at the old photo of Abby and young Thomas. I am suspicious that be it book or movie Oskar/Owen taking care of Eli/Abby is not going to be a healthy loving relationship and Oskar/Owen will grow up and be twisted in some manner. Fifth) LTROI book and movie both express that there are real monsters in the world be they school yard bullies, alcoholic abusive fathers, and adults with dysfunctional relationships but the least of concerns is the little girl vampire next door. Heck even the cats are blas about the school yard bullies, alcoholic abusive fathers, and adults with dysfunctional relationships but once a vampire is in the house, it is Smack Down Time. LMI did not even touch on that story line. Summation, LTROI book was awesome, LTROI movie did a really good, but LMI sucked real bad. Just my 2 cents.",1309046400,,2518,4.4880174291939

Can't always have packets or bottles from the blood bank.  What I'm trying to say is, this is a movie to think about and watch more than once.  In fact, I think I'd be interested in the book, since I understand from another reviewer that it goes into more details about Eli's background.  Eli doesn't say much except to ask Oskar questions and give advice.

It's about the end of childhood; about loneliness, made more poignant because the adults are just as lost as the children. Sometimes, it's hard to tell who is old and who is young. But, to call it an allegory is to risk turning away those who just want to see a fabulous story. This is that, for sure. A quiet one, with more chills that frights. And lots to think about.

I'm not Swedish, and I'm not familiar with many Swedish actors. But wow, what a cast! The children are incredible. I won't forget them in this, for sure. And I guess I got the version with the ""good"" subtitles, because they were just fine.

The menu at the end of the film was frozen - you couldn't watch the special features without restarting the movie, a real pain because there was no direct access to the menu without sitting through the crap that preceded it.

3703779,1,B001MYIXAW,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

It doesn't astound me at all that the majority of mainstream film critics gave ""Let the Right One In"" a free pass! They have been suckered in by so many pretentious 'art' films these days, why can't an ordinary horror film be included in their pantheon? The critics' level of self-deception is so high on this film that there were zero negative reviews, only one mixed and 29 positive reviews on Metacritic (the mixed one was by Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly; unfortunately, it's only a capsule blurb).

For the majority of internet posters with dissenting opinions, their main objection was that the film was too slow-paced to be worthwhile. There are plenty of films that are slow-paced but they still hit the mark, so to criticize the film merely on the grounds that it's tedious, misses the point as to why 'The Right One' is so reprehensible.

It begins in a Stockholm suburb and it looks like this is going to be another tired serial killer retread. The killer (Hakan) has slit the throat of a young man walking in a park, hangs him upside down, dangling from a tree, and then attempts to collect the blood into a gasoline can as it drips from the victim's neck. Soon, however, we learn that Hakan is actually a vampire (or rather an assistant to a vampire who appears to be 12 years old). The 12 year old 'female', named Eli, actually has been alive since the middle ages (the book that the film is based on includes more graphic details on Eli's origins--that she, rather he, was castrated by a sadistic vampire nobleman).

Some critics (such as Roger Ebert) became enamored with the relationship angle between Oskar, the lonely 12 year old protagonist, and his new found vampire friend. Oskar already has a fascination with crime to begin with, cutting out articles from the local newspapers detailing sordid murders occurring in nearby localities. While Oskar seems to have a nose for crime, the local police in 'Let the Right One In"" seem to be oddly absent during the investigation into the killings initiated by Hakan and his juvenile master, Eli.

One wonders why Eli suddenly takes a liking to little Oskar since she has no guilt feelings about draining the blood out of various other upstanding members of the community. Since those community members all seem to depicted as a bunch of louts or buffoons, I guess it's okay that Hakan and Eli can do whatever they want to them with impunity. Eli further displays her 'sensitive side' when she advises Oskar to strike back at the local bullies who have been harassing him.

There are very few films that will feature a murderous monster who is depicted as not being so bad after all. Somehow it doesn't bother Oskar that his gal pal goes around dispatching whoever she feels like it. Not only is Oskar's acquiescence condoned, but the film's scenarists have no guilt feelings about promoting the idea that it's good for a 12 year old to take the law into his own hands. Even worse is the idea that it's okay for a boy who's been bullied, to take revenge, acting just as sadistically as his tormentors did toward him (Recall how Oskar takes delight in whipping the school bully across the face with a pole).

I suppose the reason why Eli is supposed to get a free pass here is because somehow she can't help herself (after all, she got bitten back in the Middle Ages). The moral of the story is that you can commit all the horrific murders you want but as long as you counsel a 12 year old boy as to the proper etiquette in dealing with a group of stick figure, cardboard cut out bullies, then you can continue traipsing around Scandinavia, committing additional atrocious crimes.

As for those of you still looking for true scenes of horror, 'The Right One' offers only slim pickings. In addition to the aforementioned opening scene where Hakan does his blood draining bit, you also get (hold on to your seats!): Eli (channeling Spiderman) scurrying up the side of a hospital building, Hakan disfiguring himself by pouring hydrochloric acid over his face, in order to escape being identified by the police and Eli returning to rip off the heads and arms of the school bullies who are about to make mince meat of Oskar at the school swimming pool.

Nothing really makes sense in 'Let the Right Thing In' including the blood sucking vampires and morally challenged 12 year olds. One can't really blame John Lindqvist, author of the book the film was based on, as well as its screenwriter, for the ultimate successful promotion of this claptrap. That honor goes to the film critics, always seeking their next great 'work of art' along with the teenage audience that went to the movie theaters in droves and (unfortunately) bought all those tickets.",1301788800,7,4761,4.699040767386091

3703786,5,B001MYIXAW,"Let me start off by addressing the fact that other reviews from years past voice concerns that the subtitles for the discs they've received through ordering online are the botched print.  Magnolia has since discontinued these discs and started printing the movie with more subtitle options, including the theatrical (correct) version.  I recently received my copy through Amazon and it was the corrected disc, and as it has been two years since the issue was last reported, I think it's safe to order this movie online.

On to the movie itself.

Most movies have music playing during the opening credits that sets the tone for the film and lets the viewer know exactly what kind of experience they're getting into.  With Let the Right One In, there is no such pandering, and the effect is a somewhat unnerving silence throughout a simple list of names set against a snowy backdrop before the movie begins.  From this moment on, you know this movie is gold.

12 year old Oskar is alone.  As a child who is viscously bullied at school with no real friends to talk to, with a mother who works most of the time and only goes through the motions of parenting, Oskar is alone.  Fascinated with murder and fantasizing about revenge on his tormentors, he spends his evenings playing with a knife and cutting out murder stories from the newspaper.

Eli is a girl who moves from place to place frequently with a man who appears to be her father.  As she seems to have no other choice, she keeps to herself, and is alone.  She and Hakan, her caretaker, have just moved in next door to Oskar.  Eli is 12 years old.  But she's been 12 for a very long time...

Let the Right One In, at first glance, sounds like just another vampire/romance flick.  But let's be clear: this is NOT just another vampire/romance flick.  This movie casts a strange, almost eerie, innocence on the world, aided by the frozen, Swedish backdrop, and achieves something that most other horror films strive for but fail to reach - realistic, very believable characters.  It's a very meaningful film that will stay with you months after viewing it.

The relationship between Oskar and Eli is incredible, helped all the more by the wonderful performances of the child actors.  Kindred spirits in isolation, the two are inevitably drawn towards each other despite Eli's initial reluctance.  Founded on a need for companionship and strength, the love that eventually blossoms between the two characters resonates with the innocence and purity felt throughout the movie, and is much more believable than your average ""oooohh, you're a vampire! Let's get it on!"" drool fest.  In fact, Eli tries to keep her vampirism a secret from Oskar until the last third of the film, terrified that Oskar will fear her and run away.

There are, of course, some very gritty and disturbing moments throughout the movie, which contrast sharply, even beautifully, with the aforementioned innocence.  Eli is a vampire, after all, and she is capable of killing in a most gruesome fashion when necessary.  The horror of what Eli is becomes truly realized when one of her victims survives, and for the first time that I can remember, we get to see what happens when a vampire breaks the old, traditional rule that it must be invited into someone's home before entering.  At the same time, the torture Oskar is put through at the hands of his bullies is portrayed as almost Christlike, making Eli's encouragement of Oskar to hit back even more effective.

All of this is balanced together with a sense of detachment.  The violence is shown at a distance from the camera, and unlike your standard Hollywood fare, the movie doesn't try to grab your attention or engage you in the characters, rather it simply takes you along for a ride, leaving it entirely up to you to sit down in the passenger's chair.  The beautiful cinematography helps to draw you in slowly, and the music never calls too much attention to itself, instead doing what it needs to and putting a subtle emphasis on the dramatic moments of the picture.

A strange, haunting movie, Let the Right One In is ultimately the best vampire story since your favorite version of Dracula. It's intelligent, cute, horrific, funny, and disturbing all at once.  There are questions that the movie leaves open to interpretation, so you'll inevitably want to read the book it is based on, which goes much more in depth in every aspect.  In the end, however, you can't go wrong with this film.",1299628800,8,4476,4.757772020725389

I understand that all here don't know who I am, but I am an amateur writer, as well as an avid vampire movie and literature fan since the '70's.

""Let the Right One In"" and ""Let Me In"" are the best vampire genre films I have watched since Stephen King's vampire masterpiece ""Salem's Lot"", which I firmly believe is the standard of modern vampire movies today.

It was probably better that ""Let Me In' was an independent film here in America, because otherwise, modern day Hollywood, big budget gory special effects would have ruined what actually carried these films... their amazing acting casts and performances.

Powerful, emotional, horrifying, and endearing all at once, ""Let The Right One In"" and it's sister film ""Let Me In"" transcend the typical hollywood vampires portrayed as glamourous, exotic, and alluring. In these films, the young boys Oskar (Let The Right One In), and counterpart Owen (Let Me In), show the real side of growing up by dealing with divorced parents, alcoholism, searching for identity, and frightening school bullies. The young-looking vampires Eli (Let The Right One In), and American counterpart Abby (Let Me In), display the loneliness, violence, and eternal hunger for blood that more accurately desplays vampirism as a curse more than as a gift.

This is REAL film-making... dirty, intense, down-to-Earth, in-your-face story-telling that grabs you and doesn't let you go until the final scene is finished.

Poor subtitles be damned. I hate using sub-titles anyway. In ""Let The Right One In"", I just used the English voice-over version over the original Swedish language. The English voice-overs are a little tinny and don't quite seem right, but they still deliver the movie's story well. The Swedish film is more true to the book by author Jon Linquist with some minor story-line changes occuring in the American version ""Let Me In"".

I guarantee that if you're a true vampire genre fan, you'll watch this film and the Americanized version over and over again.

One dark night he meets a girl, Eli [Lina Leandersson], in the playground. Eli says she can't be his friend, but is lonely, too. Night after night they meet in the playground, and their friendship grows. They gain each other's trust and tell one another their secrets. Oskar, that he's bullied at school, Eli, that she's a vampire.

Let the Right One In is perfect balance of a vampire movie and a coming of age film. Intelligent and complex, it explores the challenges of growing up as well as the struggles of the lonely vampire.

3703791,5,B001MYIXAW,"I have always thought that Horror movies could be art, and go beyond the tropes that they generally find themselves in.  This movie was able to be eerie and satisfying to the horror movie lover in me, but at the same time, I have shown this movie to people who do not generally like horror movies.  I think what seperates this movie from others is though it does have gore, jump effects and a generally nihlistic point of view, it does not rely on them, but rather, it uses all of the tools at its disposal.  The focus of the story is on a child who goes through some of the worst bullying  ever seen on film without every seeming to go overboard.  I believed the problems the protaganist was having both at school and at home with his mother going through a divorce.  He meets someone as he sits out by the playground outside of his apartment complex at night.  They talk as too people that may be the most lonely and in need of a friend relationship I have ever seen that transends the ages they both appear to be.  There are murders going on in the background.  There seems to be a focus on the animalistic qualities of man eating each other, and just how bleak our day to day existance is, and the glimmer of hope is seen between the two children and a group at a bar, that seem to discount civilized morals, in favor of a more pride mentality of taking care of only the group at any cost.  You can also see this in a group of children who act as the tormentors to the protaganist.  I want to add that one of my favorite parts of the book is the revelation that the little girl is really a little boy.  There are small references that indicate that she is not a girl, and it was assumed by me that it was a reference to her vampire nature, when really it is a reference to her having a crude sex change operation and sold into prostitution, and though we may think we have become more civilized, but we really haven't.  The question is not whether violence is justified, by what justifies it.",1297987200,4,1996,4.2348284960422165
3703792,5,B001MYIXAW,"I am not a horror-film fan.

The Jasons and the Freddys and the forgotten-half-brother-of-the-high-school-jock who grows up to kill the children of his tormentors at summer camp, don't do it for me either.

There are a few, though, that are really well done and speak more about phobias that plague each of us and how we adapt or are marginalized by them. Films like The Exorcist, Carrie, The Amityville Horror and even Fright Night whose dark expose offers up the spiritual in a backhanded way whereas the viewer is made to understand the esoteric mechanics of life.

The great works of Art do. This is their purpose.

When Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein, nearly a century and a half ago, the issue she (and her mother and step-father for that matter) wrestled with was the idea of how to re-construct the human being to get him/ her to see beyond the psychology that defines gender and nature. The Hollywood bastardization of this great novel with its grotesque redepiction of the Creation undermined the motivation of the author and, by default, the message.

LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (2008) is director Tomas Alfredson's visionary adaptation of author John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel of the same name.

In this film, the Swedish version (and the far, far superior version to the US release) we meet Oskar (brilliantly played by Kare Hedebrandt) a twelve-year old or as he'd say to Eli, ""twelve years, eight months and nine days!""

Oskar is the stereotypical outcast. He's fearful of going to school. Fearful of what the school day will bring in the form of the school's bullies, who relentless taunt him because he doesn't ""fit in.""

Does Oskar really not ""fit in?"" I suggest that it would be a gross misunderstanding to characterize his isolation by a few as being someone who doesn't ""fit in."" Of course, he fits in. He was a normal teenager. He loved swimming, loved his Rubic's Cube and admired the girls who wouldn't give him (or many of us, at that age) the time of day, preferring the company of those who made his life (and ours) a living hell.

Oskar lets out steam in a time and place where he feels completely free to express himself: outside in the cold, dark evenings of the deserted playground directly under the watchful eye of his loving, single-mother. He fancies taking out his aggressions not on society at-large, not on any innocent classmates, but on the bullies themselves. And, that's an important distinction to make.

It was during one of these moments, coincidentally, where he meets Eli (played equally brilliant by Lena Leandersson) a mysterious girl who looks to be about the same age as Oskar. And, in fact, just before he tells her how old he is, she tells him that she is ""twelve... more or less.""

""More or less?"" What does that mean, ""more or less?"" Oskar's inquiry leads him no where. Who is this girl? Why doesn't she know how old she is? Why is she dressed like this? And, why is she out here in the cold, barefooted in nothing but a nightdress? He has so many questions but they seem to elude his naturally inquisitive mind when he stopped to look at her friendly face.

This movie, unlike its predecessors, has only a few moments of violence (considering the subject). That is to say, you'll not be shocked by excessive gore. She is a vampire, of course, and as such she is driven by solely survival propensities and nothing more.

The film, to its director's credit, doesn't rely on the creature's physiological pursuit. This is a relationship film, plain and simple. And, we relate because we understand. We see ourselves in the many faces that play different characters.

At the heart of this film is an intimate discussion about friendship, loyalty, about confronting fear and daring to ask the unspeakable questions to and about ourselves and the people we have relationships with.

This is the genius of this film. This is a work of art.

Right now, we're facing cut backs in art programs in schools all around the US. The prevailing notion is that the arts are an unnecessary expenditure. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, the film (and I venture to say the book, as well) is an argument against that notion. There are but a few who're profiting financially from this film and book, but to reduce the value of what we experience in terms of dollars and cents is to miss the whole point.

What can be gained? How about the same conversation that Shelley had? How about re-imagining ourselves, not as a grotesque Hollywood reinvention, but as an amalgam of ideas, dreams, lessons, as thinking, rational, compassionate human beings who share the wealth of our experiences with our fellow man for no other motivation than to see and to be a part of a more prosperous community.

3703795,5,B001MYIXAW,"I remember back in college taking a literature class that focused solely on the history and origin of vampire-based literature going back to the Roman era. The original premise of the vampire was nothing like you see in the Twilight movies or Western Culture/Hollywood's version of the vampire as being Wesley Snipe's Blade or the cool kids that drive brand new Volvo's to school or soap opera models. Vampires were flawed outcasts of their society. And much of the drama was based on these creatures penetrating the normal world and trying to live parallel to humans whiles satisfying their own desires. In fact, the flaw and weakness of the vampire was their inability to live normal mundane lives whiles desiring to live such a life. In the first vampire literature it was the vampires who were the victims of a stern conservative religious society that ostracized and exterminated anything that didn't confirm to their beliefs or modes. There is also a strong homoerotic and sexuality of the vampire but also love and caring between vampires or between a vampire and a human they desired.
Hollywood missed the point completely but Let The Right One In touches on all the original facets of the vampire literature.
It is unpolished, cold, gritty, sensual, restraint and beautiful. And it does this with kids! It is an adult horror movie staring kids!
They are no big stars or supermodels or teen sensations in this movie so there is a high degree of honesty and storytelling in the film. Nothing is dumbed-down or over explained like Hollywood tends to do. These actors are not going to be plastered on book bags or have action figures made of them or be in coca cola or Volvo adverts. This is honest and pure story telling without the clutter of special effects or product placement.

3703796,5,B001MYIXAW,"Oskar is ignored at home and bullied at school, but he soon finds a friend in his new neighbor next door. Eli is strange and distant at first, but as the two grow closer, she reveals that she is a young vampiress who must consume blood to survive. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is Tomas Alfredson's beautiful and captivating adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's best-selling novel. It incorporates the coming of age theme with a budding romance, while molding the classic vampire mythos into something wholly original. Alfredson's restrained shooting style is subtle but extremely effective. By paring down the color palette to a collection of cool blues and grays, he not only emphasized the frigid surroundings, but also Eli and Oskar's icy dispositions leading up to their friendship. He then contrasts the bleak coloring with saturated reds as a form of foreshadowing. Rather than simply relying on computerized imaging to display her powers, Eli's supernatural abilities are implied just off screen in a number of cleverly crafted shots. A review of the film would mean nothing without mentioning the moving performances by Lina Leandersson and Kre Hedebrant as the two young leads. Because the majority of the picture is spent following their growing relationship, the more horrific moments become that much more shocking and unexpected. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN defies each of the recent trends in Horror by focusing on its compelling characters and touching love story over excessive amounts of gore and violence.

3703800,4,B001MYIXAW,"""Let the Right One In"" is a terrific little movie. It is hard to pigeonhole this as a horror movie since the ""horror"" aspect is secondary to it's main premise which is isolation and loneliness. The ""horror"" aspect is all together more startling since this is an  unconventional and unpredictable film.

The movie is about a lonely, [practically] abandoned and physically immature kid. He's weird and get bullied a lot. Because his parents are divorced and the mother does not give him that much attention, his abuse and loneliness are all the more excasperated.

As he hangs out at his apartment complex, which is all that he has to do, he befriends another lonely child...who just happens to be a vampire. They both are lonely yet for very different reasons. She's lonely because she is a monster. However, their mutual companionship develops a bond where each charactor sets aside or accepts any flaws of the other.

As their relationship blossoms, so does the deadly vampirical activites of the little girl. Eventually the boy finds out about it and the vampire candidly discloses her tendencies. It does not matter to the boy since he is so hungry for companionship and acceptance. Of course as the movie proceeds so does the vampire's increasing hunger for blood. Eventually, the beast in the vampire inevitably must conflict with the innocense of the relationship.

Once again, this is a small and subtle movie. It is hardly a big scale production. The plot relies on charactor development and emotion as opposed to action and excessive violence. Some viewers discuss the climax as though it's some, phenomenal piece of terrifying action. In reality, the ending is merely symbolic and consistent with the relationship that was created throughout the story.

Not only is this a unique way to tell a vampire story but, also, the setting, in a nordic, snow-covered, urban landscape is quite different from the usual vampire fare.

What makes this movie special is not the scares or gore (which there are) but rather  the very proven success in telling a very adult tale through child's eyes...a la ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". Vampire films are a dime a dozen but when it is told through a child's perspective it can be very creepy.

This is a very good movie done in a unique way. On it's own, it is certainly quality film making. As compared to the ""horror"" genre, it's heads and tails above the ususal making this among the best vampire movies.",1293753600,2,2446,4.84652278177458
3703801,5,B001MYIXAW,"Thomas Alfredson's ""Let The Right One In"" is a sparse, poetic, slim masterpiece of a film which is part Guillermo Del Toro and part Bruno Schulz.

Based on John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-me-In-Let-the-Right-One-In-Hardcover/dp/B002BPIWIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let me In [Let the Right One In] [Hardcover</a>] about a 12 year old boy named Oskar (played with an understated melancholy by Kre Hedebrant) and his newfound ""girlfriend"" Eli (in a brilliant performance which makes you wonder how old the actress (Lina Leandersson) herself really is.  The opening shot of the film is a tide of glistening snow, pulsating in a black canopy night, setting the mood of the dark tale which paints a bleak portrait of human nature and the Darwinian world of pre-teen/early teen relations. (Another thing I admired about the movie is how honest it is about this stage of our lives.  People often portray relations between kids as being idyllic.  I don't remember it that way at all. While I don't remember anyone trying to drown me, it's not too far.)

Oskar is constantly set upon by bullies and there are shots when the abuse he endures is viewed as Christlike.  The cinematography here is perfect.  His mother (Karin Bergquist) is of no help to the kid and his father is practically absent.
He is alone most of the time and his recreational activities consist of sticking knives into trees while pretending he is killing his enemies.

Eli appears on the scene in a shot worthy of Bunuel.  Alone in the abandoned courtyard of Oskar's apartment courtyard she is fresh from another kill and looms over the child as either a potential predator or a friend.  Fortunately for the viewer, she chooses the latter.

The bond that develops between the two is at first informal, cold, but slowly develops.  There is a child killer loose where Oskar lives and Eli's dubious relationship with him is never discovered by Eli.  After being captured it becomes apparent that the murderer is serving Eli.  The question the film leaves one with is thus: is it Eli's intent that Oskar fill this role?  Is his destiny going to be as ill fated as the killer?  Does she swoop down and save him from a near fatal incident of bullying because they are truly bound or because she needs another servant?

Like anyone else I thought it was a bit much using 12 year olds for this kind of role. However, there is nothing here that is all that perverse, except for one single shot which I found absolutely unnecessary and gross.  The reason Alfredson uses kids for the role is not for any nasty reason (if you want an example of that check out some of Larry Clark's movies) but to allow the film a child's imagination.  Reminiscent of George Romero's film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martin/dp/B0004Z33E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martin</a>&nbsp;this is one of the genius takes on the concept of the vampire.",1293753600,2,3143,5.149606299212598

Rarely do I come across a recent film that I instantly like and can consider a classic; ""Let the Right One In"" is one of them. Being your average lazy, ignorant American I usually do not watch foreign speaking films but I checked this out after watching the American adaptation ""Let Me In"". Hearing that it was a remake of a Swedish film I was naturally curious to check out the original version...and was very pleased with it.
  The original Swedish version ""Lat Den Ratte Komma In"" is masterfully directed by Tomas Alfredson from a script by John Ajvide Lindqvist(based on his original novel), this Swedish film as does the American remake both have a cast of fine actors and is well done but the Swedish original more closely follows the original book as far as revealing the shocking secret of Eli's true gender and nature-the mood of the film is also quite evident setting and enhancing the general tone of loneliness and isolation experienced by the two main characters.
  This film is a romanticized vampiric tale and no I do not mean the ""Twilight"" kinda romanticism which I abhore-but done in an intelligent, tasteful way. The two young actors; Kare Hedebrant(Oskar) and Lina Leandersson(Eli) turn in very effective, emotional performances all the more impressive considering that this was Lina Leandersson's first ever acting job on screen-these two young actors will surely be big players in the Swedish film industry if not international stars at some point in the future.
  The best way I can describe or compare this film to is; ""Romeo & Juliet"" except in this case Juliet happens to be a 200 year old vampire who looks like a 12 year old girl. The film has a dark tone to it and some would say has a tragic end of sorts but it is in essence a love story, not overly sappy and done with great care and intelligence.
  The DVD package is well done, top quality picture and sound complete with a little behind the scenes look with the films director, it also features a deleted scenes section which has four cut scenes from the film-the two scenes with the main characters (Eli & Oskar) especially stand out. I am a big fan of commentary but alas this film has none and it is my only pet peeve(other than the poor English dubbing-watch it with the english subtitles instead)-but some filmakers do not like to do commentaries(Steven Spielberg is a big name for example)while some other filmakers are just not good at it.

3703809,5,B001MYIXAW,"Oscar is one of those kids that constantly finds himself picked on. In his freetime he dreams of serial killing, even keeping an album on the deeds of other men. He also has a knife and imagines himself killing over and over again, and this little deed attracts the attnetion of Eli. Eli first approaches Oscar on a playground outside of his apartment as he works on a Rubic Cube, and the two quickly strike up conversation. for all intents and purposes, it is an innocent affair between two 12 year olds. The only problem is that Eli has a friend she lives with and that friend hangs people from trees and drains them of blood. Worse still, Eli drinks blood to survive and has a need to feed - even if that means picking off people in the most unlikely of positions.

Before I begin, I have to note that this is not the book Let Me In. If you watch closely you can see a lot of the pieces here, but you lose a lot as well. You lose Oscar's problems, Eli's ways, and you lose her ""roommates"" deal. you also lose eli's past, something that is hinted to, and a lot of other things. Still, that doesn't mean that much. Personally, i like the two of them and I keep them as different things in my mind. I do not like to mix the two, either, because the picture of eli in them movie is one I love. I like the way the two kids get along ore than anything, and I like the way things go. True, I would have liked the things that Eli can do with her hands and feet, but I am willing to give that up for the greater good of the movie. Besides, putting that stuff in would have certainly made this movie something that a lot of people would have protested.

When you wathc this, everything from the acting to the way things go are beautiful. You have no idea how old Eli is here, but you get ideas of some things aobut here. She has a thing for puzzles, and one of the things she has is valuable enough to ""buy a nuclear power plant"" if sold. You also see the pain that Eli feels and the way that she seems to want to be loved. I have a thing with Oscar, not the actor but the kid in the movie, and I really am not a fan. I know hes a 12 year old, but he does things that are cruel. The thing with not inviting Eli in is hard to watch because shesimply wants someone to care, and other things hapen as well. Still, it is tender in a lot of places and, honestly, it touches me and creeps me out as well.

This movie has some stuff in it that is kiddy. you might keep that in mind when wathcing it. You might also keep in mind that it is not the book so, for those who didn't like the reading, you have something different. As I said before, this is NOT the bok and sometimes reading it may even hurt what you have seen. You get background and some stuff you may want to know, but knowing them hurts the relationship. honestly, stick with the 5 star movie unless you simply have to have it all. this is a great feature and you can love it forever.",1290556800,4,2934,4.037800687285223
3703810,4,B001MYIXAW,"The tagline of the chilling Swedish thriller ""Lt den rtte komma in"" (""Let the Right One in"") goes like this: ""Eli is 12 years old. She's been 12 for over 200 years and, she just moved in next door."" And Eli has a secret to hide, a big, dark secret that a 12-year-old boy Oskar, who befriends Eli, is to know very soon

Perhaps you already know the secret of Eli, an enigmatic girl with a pale face. Yes, she is a vampire. Not much is known about her past. Set in the early 80s, the film follows the story of a bullied boy Oskar and Eli, a girl who lives with a tired, middle-aged man Hkan. His past is shrouded in nearly as much mystery as Eli herself. All we know is Hkan, always faithful to Eli, is ready to do anything for her - even if it may violate laws.

""Let the Right One in,"" based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist (which I haven't read), is not just a vampire horror. It works as a horror, and it scares us in a most unexpected way (like a stylish swimming pool sequence which is unforgettable), but the film is also a very dark version of a ""boy-meets-girl"" story. The difference is, their romance is not always sweet, and the couple's ""happiness"" does not necessarily mean that of the others around them.

Director Tomas Alfredson gives a unique twist to the now familiar conventions of vampire tales: gender-reversed roles of main characters, for instance (compare this one with the ""Twilight"" saga). To some viewers the most intriguing part of the film would be the untold story of Eli the vampire. Where did she come? Is she alone? The film is set in the 1980s - but why is that? Possibilities are suggested and they are open to our imagination. And what makes the film special is the cold atmosphere and the chemistry between the leads.

3703813,5,B001MYIXAW,"Bram Stoker would be shaking in his coffin if he were to see how vampires are being portrayed today on TV and in Movies.  Movies like ""Twilight"" and TV shows like ""Vampire Diaries"" are bringing Vampires out in the daytime, having them in intimate relationships dealing with ""high school"" drama.  Thankfully directors such as Neil Jordan (""Interview with The Vampire"") and Tomas Alfredson stayed true to the legend of the Vampire.

""Let The Right One In"", starring Kre Hedebrant as ""Oskar"" and Lina Leandersson as ""Eli"" brings the classic vampire tale back with a unique twist.  The film is based on the book by the same name from Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist.  ""Let The Right One In"" begins with a man out in the woods collecting blood from a recently killed person.  Little do we know this collection is for a 12 year old vampire who has been living for hundreds of years.  It is a fresh take on the classic vampire dilemma: finding food and staying out of site and sun.

One of the many things this film got right was the atmosphere.  This is a Swedish film and was shot entirely in Sweden.  This was the perfect setting for a film like this.  The constant snow fall and dreary look of the town really added to the realism of the movie.  Unlike ""Interview with The Vampire"", I could relate more to this modern setting.  The director chose exactly the right times for the music score to come in.  He didn't saturate every moment like a lot of horror directors tend to do.

This story is a lot more than just a vampire girl trying to survive.  It is also a story of love and redemption.  Oskar is constantly being bullied by the local kids and he is always so retreated and alone.  Eli brings a sense of wonder to his life.  He finds in her an oddness that brings him out of his shell.  He builds a relationship with her carefully and slowly. She teaches him how to stand up for himself and gives him confidence.  It is an interesting back and forth between the two as their relationship builds.  A testament to the director and the actors.

This is a wonderful film that has single-handedly brought a genre out of the ""sparkly"" hole vampire films have been in for the last few years.

3703819,5,B001MYIXAW,"Okay. I'll admit it. I am really sick of vampires, unless they are being used as bullet fodder. Until the trendy Twilight craze finally dies down, I will usually avoid vampire books/films/TV shows, etc. like the plague.

This film was completely different, and utterly refreshing. Dark and pensive, and beautiful in a bleak Scandinavian manner, Let The Right One In completely hooked me and became one of my favorite films from the first time I watched it. No sparkly vegetarian vamps here (thank God!!!). Only two lonely and strange youngsters who find comfort and protection in each other's company. While there seems to be an element of romance, it is not a ""romance"" in the traditional cheeseball sense.

I don't want to give a lot away...this is simply a film that you must watch to understand and appreciate. If you are looking for another Twilight-esque vampire film, look elsewhere...for the rest of us, this film is a true gem.

3703821,5,B001MYIXAW,"Let the Right One In is a rare accomplishment in a genre that has been stale and lifeless for some time. It takes the vampire story and successfully brings us characters that are empathetic, vulnerable, sweet and chilling. Lina Leandersson totally inhabits the character of Eli; making us truly feel for the tragic story of, what I believe, is still an innocent child. For an actor of 11 in her first role, Leandersson is amazing in the subtle nuances that she gives to Eli. Her large eyes exude sadness and unspoken thoughts while an ineffable air shows us why she is ""twelve, more or less."" Kare Hedebrant has not gotten his full due as Oskar, the bullied and isolated boy who finds love, kinship and a soulmate in Eli. Without his convincing portrayal of Oskar's vulnerability and pain, the story would not have worked.

Director Tomas Alfredson takes his time to allow the relationship to build and to show why Eli and Oskar would be drawn to each other. He also successfully uses the landscape and atmosphere to increase the feeling of cold and isolation that draws the two main characters together. I believe the best way to watch the film is with the theatrical subtitles and Swedish language.

Regarding the details of the DVD; the audio and video quality is excellent and the setup gives you a variety of audio options. The features are a bit sparse but, what is there is entertaining. I particularly liked the ""Behind the Scenes"" feature, though it was a little short.

I believe you can't go wrong with this movie or DVD and you will quickly fall in love with Lina Leandersson's portrayal of Eli. A unique gem of a movie in a worn out genre.",1288656000,2,1652,4.631399317406143
3703822,5,B001MYIXAW,"A great movie. The reviews here on Amazon include some older (and helpful) ones that note problems with the translation and format. These kinds of problems have been resolved in this blu-ray.

If you liked either version, it is well worth seeing the other. The two versions are close, but the subtle differences are intriguing, and the story is so good. For my taste, I give the American version a slight edge. It is darker, scarier, and I think deeper, in the sense of presenting the vampire as truly monstrous despite her pretty packaging. The Swedish version is more sympathetic to the vampire.",1288137600,2,755,4.815384615384615
3703823,2,B001MYIXAW,"As a person who has seen this movie, the recent remake, and actually read the book, I can say that this was a good attempt to bring the novel to life, but it falls short.  There are so many events and characters that are left out of the movie.  It really only focuses on Eli and Oskar ( Abby and Owen ) just like the remake.  Most of the disturbing content has been removed (the pedophilia , the flashbacks to Eli's childhood, Virginia's dilemma, the hunt for Harkan (spelling), etc... )
  However, I must confess that I am not a fan of most foreign films, as the lighting, actors, and all the minor details that make a movie come to life as usually of lesser quality.  I found this to be the case once again.  If you liked the 2010 remake, which I loved, then this movie is a little closer to the book, but not enough to make me want to watch it again.",1288137600,2,853,4.133333333333334
3703824,5,B001MYIXAW,"""Let The Right One In"" is billed as a vampire horror film and I am not a horror movie fan. Even so, this is one of the best films I have seen in a long time.  There is some blood and gore, but much of the gore is off camera and the blood seems only that which is necessary to support the story line.  In the end, the ""horror"" aspects of this film are subsidiary to the main theme, which centers on the relationship between the two main characters: Oskar and Eli.

Oskar is a 12 year old boy, whose parents are separated.  He lives with his mother in an apartment complex in a town in Sweden and also makes occasional visits to his father.  For the most part, he is ignored by his parents.  He has limited social skills and no friends at school, where he is bullied by several male classmates.  All of this leaves Oskar feeling very isolated.

One cold winter night in the yard outside his apartment, Oskar meets Eli, who has recently moved into the apartment next door and appears to be a girl about Oskar's age.  There is something not quite right about Eli and the viewer soon learns that she is a vampire, a fact that is not apparent to Oskar until much later in the film.  Eli lives with a caretaker, a man who appears to be about a generation and one-half older than she.  His main function is to provide Eli with what any vampire needs to survive - a supply of human blood.  The film does not explain the background of the relationship between Eli and her caretaker, but, in any event, the caretaker is out of the story midway through the film, which means that Eli is then as alone and isolated as Oskar.

Initially, Eli tells Oskar that she cannot be his friend, but, as the movie progresses, these two lonely souls form a friendship which steadily grows.  By the end, there is a bond of devoted friendship and love between the two.  The love is not sexual in nature, but love nevertheless because any truly loving relationship is built on friendship.  The film demonstrates in no uncertain terms what real friendship and love mean: never doing anything to harm one another; doing whatever is necessary to assure that a friend is safe and secure; and, if necessary, being willing to give up everything, if that what the friend needs for his or her survival.  Can any movie convey a message that is as sweet and poignant as this?

The cinematography is excellent, beautifully displaying the cold Swedish winter, with stark white landscapes.  This seems to emphasize Oskar's and Eli's isolation.  Also, the musical score is great -- a rich and wonderful compliment to the story.

I recently acquired my copy of this DVD by buying it at a nearby Blockbuster store that was closing and liquidating its inventory.  I learned, after my purchase, that I have the earlier version of the DVD that does not have the ""theatrical"" subtitles.  I have watched the movie twice - once with English subtitles and once with the dubbed English audio.  If you do find yourself with the earlier version of this disk and are watching the dubbed audio, also turn on the ""English Narrative Subtitles,"" which give subtitled translations to various notes and other written matter which is not orally translated by the dubbed voices.",1288051200,2,3214,4.549565217391304
3703825,5,B001MYIXAW,"""Let the Right One In"" is a great film, in my view one of the best films of the modern era and far and away the best horror movie I have seen.  This Blu-Ray edition has the theatrical English subtitles, thanks to Magnet Releasing's wise decision to discontinue producing the poorly-done prior version in the middle of 2009.  If you are considering buying this Blu-Ray, please DISREGARD the customer reviews that have given it 1-star due to the subtitle problem, as those complaints are now moot.  As Amazon has stated near the top of the product listing (but unfortunately contradicted by the hundreds of negative reviews that are still posted about the no-longer-a-problem-subtitle-issue), the Blu-Ray is what you would have seen if you were one of the lucky few who got to see Tomas Alfredson's masterpiece in theaters.

Alfredson, not traditionally a horror director, brings the perfect touch to this coming-of-age story.  Oskar and Eli are both identifiable and sympathetic, much more so than one would think if you merely read the story on paper.  Even the less sympathetic characters are fleshed out (literally and figuratively) as the story progresses so that when violence does erupt, it has that much more impact.  This is not your uncle's slasher film with cardboard characters that are offered up merely for the killing.

Lina Leandersson and Kare Hedebrant, as Eli and Oskar, are spot on in their portrayals, giving nuanced performances well ahead of their years.  If as a child you were ever bullied, or felt like an outsider, or regarded the adults around you as only ""half there"" and not fully engaged in your life even when you tried to call out to them, even if these were only things you saw others going through as a 12-year-old or young teenager, you can relate to these characters.

Visually and in its sound landscape, the film is nothing short of terrific.  The cold, wintry Swedish town, and the troubled (sometimes pathetic) apartments and people who live in them, serve as a perfect backdrop.  Afredson keeps his camera at a distance from much of the bloody action, choosing a more subtle approach except for the few scenes when more explicit violence was appropriate.  The result is a haunting, beautiful film that belongs in any Blu-Ray collector's library.  5+ stars!",1287964800,7,2296,4.92987012987013
3703826,4,B001MYIXAW,"I watched this movie, having heard about the American remake and being interested in the original.

3703828,4,B001MYIXAW,"Admittedly I am late to the game on this one (as I usually am for most movies). I heard great things about the original ""Let the Right One In"" that I took a rare trip to the movie theater to see the Americanized version alternately titled ""Let Me In"". The day after, the Swedish version arrived from Netflix and I put it on while it rained outside and was particularly gloomy. Please note that I have not read the book but I plan on doing so soon.

Spoilers may follow so please read with some caution as I don't want to spoil either version of this story for anyone.

Starting off, I noticed that the film was dubbed with cheesy voice acting. So I had to go into the settings to switch that off and put on the subtitles. Now I've read previous reviews of how bad the subtitles were but since I don't know a lick of Swedish, I really couldn't tell if the translation was bad or not. I may have had a newer version so it might not have been an issue.

""Let the Right One In"" is tricky for me. I liked it. I did. The Americanized version changes a few things that make it a tad more suspenseful (and I would give it a slight edge over the original) but overall, they are the same film. The story centers on the main characters of Eli (Lina Leandersson), a child vampire and Oskar (Kre Hedebrant), a bullied 12 year old boy. Eli moves into the apartment next to Oskar and they start a dysfunctional relationship.

A lot of people define this film as horror combined with a love story. The horror usually centers around Eli's physical vampiric form and the murders she commits alongside the usual trappings of bloodlust and aversion to sunlight. The love story centers on Eli and Oskar's nervous first meeting, awkward attempts at connecting, and finally their acceptance for one another in the ""not-so-but-still-kind-of Hollywood"" ending.

I'd like to offer an alternate perspective.

""Let the Right One In"" isn't a horror movie or love story told in traditional dramatic fashion. Under the surface, the real horror is that Eli is a manipulative monster akin to the notorious serial murderers throughout history. Eli's true monster is revealed when she says several times to Oskar that she is not a girl. Though she appears female, in her mind, she is genderless. Sex, emotion, everything that makes a person human has long since vanished. Because it is suggested that she is indeed quite a bit older than the 12 years she resembles, her thoughts are more evolved than an actual 12 year old child. She is an old spirit trapped in the body of a child. She knows this, hates it, and yet revels in it. And she uses it to her advantage. Hkan, her older traveling companion is a mere tool. Eli uses him for appearances while going through the motions of human interaction only to keep him on a leash. Hkan's actual, true love for her compels him to murder and keep her sustained on blood so suspicions won't be cast her way and to keep her safe. His, and Oskar's love for this monster is the true tragic love story.

Hkan's jealousy over Eli's new friendship with Oskar makes him feel inadequate and he knows he is losing her to another after so many years of being together. He sees this and knows he can't stop it which would cause anyone who has loved another that deeply to crash and burn emotionally. Examples of her cruelty to him during this time can be viewed in several scenes. Her anger at his failed attempts to bring her blood, her cold manner when telling him to get out of his room so she can lie there and talk with Oskar on the other side of the wall, and when he tells her that he doesn't want Eli to see that ""other boy"", all she does is place a hand on Hkan's face and walks away. His depression causes him to be sloppy in his killing to the point that he subconsciously wants to be caught so he can be free of her hold over him. In the end, Hkan's will isn't strong enough to free himself and he pays the price most horrendously.

Oskar on the other hand is fresh meat for Eli. She knows Hkan's usefulness is about to end so she seeks another companion that will travel with her for a long time. Why choose another child that looks around her age though? Because she knows children are easily manipulated. Though she could easily identify with the adults, her curse is being eternally trapped in a child's body so she has to make do. Eli also knows that creating the bond early on will bind that person to her more closely so that when that person is old enough, they will be willing to do anything to keep her safe and happy.

The ending is not bittersweet or cute. It is horrifying. Because we know, as the audience, that Eli has snared and will eventually destroy another life. When Oskar has reached the end of his usefulness years down the road, she will discard him and begin the cycle all over again.

Like I mentioned before, I believe the Americanized, ""Let Me In"" to be slightly superior only because some extraneous moments in the Swedish version were altered or cut right out which helped the story flow.

3703831,5,B001MYIXAW,"A friend at work (who knows my interests in films) told me about this. He knows I'm into foreign films, serious dramas, and
stories of a mature nature. So when he mentioned  ""Let The Right One In"" was about a 12 year old vampire in Sweden and
a 12 year old boy, I listened and thought, ""Yea right, come on man.""  He raved about this film, asked me to trust him on it,
so I said I would check out the reviews on it, do some research, and get back with him. I got the blu-ray, and proceeded
late one night to watch it, still thinking it was probably over-rated and over-hyped like so many movies these days are. I
can only say I was totally unprepared for what I was about to experience.  From the first shots of the heavy snow falling
(with the opening credits) and ominous music to the stunning final few minutes, I was totally mesmerized and riveted. It
had such an effect on me that I just sat there trying to collect my thoughts, and it stayed on my mind for several days to
follow. Of course, I've watched it again several times since. There are so many things going on with ""Let The Right One In""
that you don't catch it ALL on the first viewing.  The music, scored by Johan Soderqvist (a new name to me), is absolutely
brilliant. I was totally unprepared, as well, for such a beautiful score with this, considering the subject matter - ANOTHER
astounding surprise.  Being a soundtrack collector, I quickly acquired a copy of the very limited edition soundtrack (only 500
copies) for my collection - pricey, but worth it.  The film's director, Tomas Alfredson, took his time in choosing the two young
actors for the lead roles (incredibly, their first film), and their performances are magnificent & totally believable, which helped
make the film so chilling.  Make no mistake, this is NOT an easy movie to watch. The physical and emotional cruelty directed
at Oskar is painful to see - many scenes are heart-wrenching. This is what makes the character Eli, who, make no mistake is
evil, so sympathetic, when bonding with the lonely, abused Oskar and ultimately, on his side in his desperate time of need at
the end; a jaw-dropping turn of events that leaves the viewer awe-struck with the gruesome AND beautiful outcome. This film
from Sweden is a genuine work of art that deserves ALL of the praise it has received. The special features section contains
several deleted scenes that add even more depth and significance to the film's story. I only have one other vampire film in
my collection (Roman Polanski's ""The Fearless Vampire Killers""), which is great, but that's totally different in tone and depth
from Alfredson's film which I find far superior.  This is a magnificent, exemplary cinematic/musical achievement that demands
one's total attention to appreciate its depth & meaning. I used the original Swedish dialogue with English subtitles on my blu-
ray copy with no problems whatsoever.  A masterpiece.",1287446400,2,2920,4.698630136986301

I played the movie about 3 times the first day I got it.  I found the combination of sweet and chilling to be effective.  The end of the movie will affect people differently and will fuel many discussions about the morality of Eli's and Oskar's relationship.

3703838,5,B001MYIXAW,"I purchased the blu-ray edition of ""Let the Right One In"" and was amazed by the quality of the film and the power of the story. First, the disc itself is relatively light on special features. But it does have all the tools you need to watch and enjoy the film.  The blu-ray features:

English Subtitles
English Theatrical Subtitles
English Narrative Subtitles

English Language Dub (for those out there who do not like to read movies)

So there are plenty of options for translation to watch. The English Language Dub is surprisingly good (usually dubs are god-awful) and I found that the voice actors did a fine job of portraying the characters and the script seemed natural.  I also watched with Theatrical Subtitles which were good, natural and realistic (no verbatim awkwardness here).

The picture itself is clear and crisp.  The shadows of a film mostly shot at night in the snow are fantastic.

The Blu-ray has a few bonus items like movie posters, stills gallery, and a very brief discussion by the director.

The movie (Don't worry NO SPOILERS) is beautiful and heart-wrenching. I found myself horrified with the adults in the movie more than with the vampire. The vampire herself is heartbreaking and funny. Oskar's school experience is tragically all too typical.  This movie should have broad appeal: vampire without the conventions of a horror flick; unconventional relationships; unconventional coming-of-age; foreign movie that is scene driven (instead of dialog driven).",1286323200,3,1486,5.103305785123967

The movie itself was great, would highly recommend it to my friends and family. This was also the first time I used the on demand/online rental service.

The film is very slow paced as well, so you will have to endure that or else hit the FF button on your remote.

Well worth watching and the copy I got from Amazon had the correct subtitles. I could watch it twice in a row , the first time  with sub-titles and the second time with the dubbed soundtrack and enjoy both versions . Thats a good sign for a great story. Just watch it, I'm sure it will blow  away Let Me In, thats the American version of this flick. Just for the casting alone. The little Girl is so good as a young actor.

3703845,5,B001MYIXAW,"As someone who trolls the reviews of various movies and music on Amazon, it's clear that a significant portion of the people writing them regularly overstate the greatness of a given work and throw out five star reviews like beads from a Mardi Gras float - so it was with cautious reservation that I finally broke down and bought ""Let The Right One In."" All I can say now that I've seen it is that, this time, the five star reviews may not be high enough praise. Within two viewings this film has become my favorite film of the year (even though it was actually made in 2008) and is a much needed emotional antidote to the sterile, barren-of-charisma characters so common in American films.

Now, I'm no film snob that automatically favors foreign films over homespun stuff (I like me hundreds of domestic films), but American films that are character driven often overdo the emotional lives of their characters and are often victimized by their own lazy, predictable writing and the rush to throw in unnecessary bells and whistles - presumably because the studios think American audiences are dolts that won't accept character-driven films that are written for adults. But quiet, deliberate films don't HAVE to be boring things no one wants to see; a movie like ""Let The Right One In"" proves it. This film is absolutely brilliant right down the line. To start with, the cinematography is amazing, and the white, frozen landscape and postcard-like framing that characterize the film play excellent counterpoint to the moments of blood red passion both literally and metaphorically. The quiet, understated way of the film also perfectly complements the inner goings-on of the two main characters. Oskar and Eli, astoundingly portrayed by Kre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson (both are Oscar worthy here...or should I say Oskar), are totally believable representations of lonely, isolated kids treading the universally rough waters of childhood while seeking emotional ""nourishment."" This film is fascinating. It plays with the ideas of vampirism and starvation (among many others) as metaphor for the need for love and as yet unfulfilled prepubescent passion. I'm sure these very qualities that make the film so utterly powerful will flatly disappear in the impending American remake - the quiet metaphors of starvation and emotional sparseness supplanted instead by an overly dramatic score and loud, effects-driven sequences. ""Let the Right One In"" however hits all the right emotional notes, is very smartly scripted, and is the most realistic and honest portrayal of pre-teens I've seen in a long, long time. In the end it's not merely an effective and sometimes very unsettling and gory vampire flick - which it is, as some of the scenes here are among the most effective horror sequences put to film recently - but it is also a touching, sweet and beautifully rendered portrayal of young love; a poetic masterwork of inner desolation, anxiety and loss; and a fearlessly dark fairytale with a final 10 minutes so emotionally powerful and gratifying I could scarcely believe what I was witnessing. Simply put: I was utterly blown away.",1284768000,9,3136,5.065764023210832
3703846,4,B001MYIXAW,"First off, I loved this movie. I thought it was haunting and innocent and just really beautiful.

My only issue was the dubbing. I expected subtitles, which is fine (I do read, lol!), but this DVD had been dubbed. The voices were TERRIBLE. Didn't match the people and it was just weird.

I'll probably re-buy this when they re-release it with the theatrical subtitles.

3703849,5,B001MYIXAW,"This movie left me speechless. It's very understated-if you are expecting 2 hours of full on gore it's not for you, this movie is to smart for that (though there are some pretty gory moments that scared me-but they are laced into the movie rather then overpowering it). But because of this it's more terrifying and unsettling then anything I've seen.

A lonely bullied 12 year old boy named Oskar befriends a 12 year old vampire named Eli who moves into his apartment complex. Eli is with a strange man who is some sort of guardian to her, and goes out murdering people (for her to drink). There was something so horrifying about this process to me, the way he hangs up his victims while still alive and drains their blood into a container. I can't think of anything that's creeped me out more-except when her guardian is waiting outside the building for a young victim-this is just how I would picture a real predator/serial killer to look as he stalks victims-and it sent chills down my spine. Through circumstances I won't give away, Eli finds herself alone with only Oskar to turn to.

It's a tender and moving relationship between Oskar and Ellie, filled with small moments of sweetness. We see Oskar continue to battle with the bullies, and Eli's existence unravel, culminating in a final scene I'm still pondering. We also see little bits of vampire lore (Eli can't come into a house uninvited, result of doing this is unpleasant to say the least).

The child vampire Eli gave an amazing performance-what an actress. If subtitles don't bother and you are looking for something out of the ordinary, you should give this one a chance. I suspect this will be much more understated and eerie then the remake they are working on now, which I'm sure will be an all out gore fest, and miss the subtleties of this amazing movie.",1283817600,5,1827,4.65015479876161

3703851,5,B001MYIXAW,"Might be the most intelligent and ""real-world"" vampire movie ever made. The other reviews are right--watch it with the ""English-theatrical"" subtitles.

It feels Swedish. The style and pacing are different than most American movies, so take it on its own terms and enjoy the difference. Hollywood is of course busy re-doing it, and may give us either an abomination or something decent, but I doubt it will come anywhere close to the original. I think this movie is just about perfect.

Unlike some of the other translated versions, the English title has the same meaning as the original Swedish one, and you can think about that title from the perspective of either Eli or Oskar.

It's a horror movie, a character study, a friendship and coming-of-age movie. It's about innocence, freedom, wisdom, cynicism, redemption, and prices to be paid. Oh, and it's a hell of a love story, too.

3703852,3,B001MYIXAW,"When I received this, there was this bold statement on the cover: ""Best. Vampire. Movie. Ever"". This movie did not live up to this glowing statement. The acting was particularly weak, the English was dubbed, and very droll, as most dubbed English is, and dramatic highlights from the book were left out. The story was fantastic. The movie deadened the characters. For me. For example, there was supposed to be a romantic affection developed between the two leads, but that never really happened. This was a huge disappointment to me. The ""Interview with a Vampire"" was infinitely better than this. Honestly. But it might be worth your while just to see the very interesting story. The hype is overblown though so keep that in mind.",1283212800,,731,4.856
3703853,5,B001MYIXAW,"I agree with the five star reviews - one of the best horror fantasies of the last three decades, no exaggeration. Let the Right One In is also one of the very few exceptional vampire movies, and the only one I have seen which truly moved me. Depending upon your interpretation of the vampire character and her motives, the film could be viewed as a quietly sweet love story (though also secret and dark), but don't let that throw you if you ordinarily don't like such flicks - it is also most definitely a horror movie. The title of the film speaks to the classic vampire lore at the heart of the plot - vampires can't enter your abode unless invited - but also underscores the poignant emotional themes of the film; for example, the risk of pain and loss which is always associated with letting people into our lives and our hearts. At the same time, I see the title as reflecting the ambiguity of the characters, which upon reflection are more complex and open to interpretation than one might at first think. It is something of a cinematic miracle that Tomas Alfredson and writer John Ajvide Lindqvist (who adapted his own novel for the film) manage to weave together sweet romanticism with all out horror in a way which compliments both moods, while also leaving the characters open to interpretation in a manner which does not frustrate, but rather enriches the experience. Let the Right One In is an amazing achievement which any fan of horror fantasy, vampire lore, complex character studies, or indeed romantic films will not want to miss.",1282003200,3,1547,4.670329670329671
3703854,5,B001MYIXAW,"This is by far one of the best Vampire movies I have seen in a long time. The story just sucks you in, very well written and directed. Some movies of this genre almost ""rely"" on great CGI or super fight scenes to help make them work and there is nothing wrong with that, but this movie certainly does not have to ""rely"" on those elements to help make it work. Now that being said this movie has some great special effects work but it doesn't need special effects as a crutch to help make it better. It doesn't need to, the story is written incredibly well. One of the things I love about this movie is the simplicity in which it was filmed. The acting by Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson is incredible, especially for their age at the time of filming. The movie has some just downright brutal scenes and at the same time you still feel such empathy for both characters. All I can say is WOW! This is a great movie!",1281657600,3,917,4.2457142857142856
3703855,5,B001MYIXAW,"This is my favorite vampire film since Blade I suppose, and is a really artful production.  The film is about how a beautiful teenage swede, in the most troubled teenage years and with a backdrop of neglectful and perhaps alcoholic parents, finds his only friend in a young girl who's very pretty and, it turns out, undead and quite bloodthirsty.  He asks her to be his girlfriend, it's really sweet.  She is also quite lonely and their teenage sense of loneliness in the big city, is monumental and convincing.

SPOILER ALERT:

And BTW, since usually vampire stories have at least overtones of some kind of morals tale, such as the Ann Rice's film version of ""Interview with a Vampire"" where there was much conjecture that Lestat's vampirism was a veiled metaphor for a deviant sexuality.  Or in the ""Blade"" franchise, where vampires are merely a more blatant example of corporate greed, etc.  Oskar's interaction with Eli, and their final scene most especially, is portent of a most special kind of relationship, not necessarily a healthy one.  My personal interpretation is that the dark side of Oskar's childhood; the neglect and broken home, manifest in his relationship with a creature of the shadows, that only he can communicate with, and using only Morse code.  Which is an awesome metaphor for any number of modern conditions and for my teenage years also in a sense.  Eli's ambiguous sexual identity is suitable, because it's Oskar's soul that is lonely, not his body.",1281139200,3,1479,4.903614457831325

Believe me, it is. I first read the book and was prepared for changes to the worse here and there, but even if i try hard, i cannot rightly complain. Partly subtle in movement and direct in words, the story is still told the same and is great to enjoy. The play on Eli's last secret is not included and holds a nice surprise for anybody who reads the books....and yet a chapter more of horror.

There are no real scares in this film, just a good story, subtly and intriguingly played out by the two young leads.  I highly recommend this film.  I did not use the supposedly butchered sub-titles, which have been mentioned in many other reviews here, but be warned that the English language overdubbing is also very bad.  The voice actors themselves are fine, but the tone of the voices is all wrong and does tend to take the viewer out of the movie.  The voices sound like people talking in an echoey sound studio, not the environments that you see on the screen.  At several points I got confused and thought the characters were supposed to be listening to a voice on a radio, until I realized what I was hearing was supposed to be the characters themselves!",1280275200,2,853,4.5064935064935066
3703859,5,B001MYIXAW,"... and definitely the best vampire movie I have ever seen.  I had chosen that caption before noting the Washington Examiner's comment on the DVD cover: ""Best. Vampire movie. Ever.""  No argument from me.  It's been about 60 hours since I caught it on cable, and I'm still in awestruck mode.  Rarely does a film leave the viewer with such an impact, pondering its ramifications, for days to follow.  It was scarcely 24 hours before I was here on Amazon ordering my own copy, because I am sure it will take many viewings to pick up on all the nuances. It's not only a must-see; it's a must-see again.

It is important to note that Eli is not a sanitized, sugar-coated vampire as in The Little Vampire or Twilight.  For all her frail-looking frame, she is the original blood-sucking, wall-crawling, dismembering horror of the Bram Stoker genre.  The gore is not the sensationalized or sadistic fare we are used to today; it is coldly mechanical.  Not evil, per se; she kills out of necessity, matter-of-factly, because she needs to in order to survive.  Being forever twelve, not just an old vampire in a young body, adds a particularly eerie touch.  The honest, endearing smiles from a blood-splattered face are terminally creepy. To portray such multiple orders of monstrosity, while retaining much of her humanity, her need -- that she has all but given up hope for -- to be loved, or at least liked, takes a special actor.  Lina Leandersson upholds these dichotomies with aplomb.  It is safe to say that Kirsten Dunst's honor as the the archetypal child vampire has been usurped.

But this is not just a horror film; it integrates that horror with outstanding beauty.  Just as A Clockwork Orange accomplishes the seemingly impossible of provoking sympathy for murderer-rapist Alex, Let the Right One In provokes sympathy for the little girl who desanguinates a man and coldly snaps his neck.  The viewer's notions of good and evil, right and wrong, are desperately challenged.  The plot is interwoven with complex morality tangles that don't untangle easily. [Plot spoiler for remainder of paragraph!]  I knew the film would be richly complex when, behind the little stone building, Oskar embraces Eli after she vomits up the candy she had tried to eat because he had bought it for her, and in their conversation she asks, ""If I weren't a girl, would you still like me?""  As for her reaction when he cuts his hand to make a blood-bond with her, you'll have to watch that for yourself.

There have been several complaints about the poor subtitling in the DVD release.  I am certain that this is release I saw on cable, because it showed the same DVD cover.  Now, my Swedish leaves a lot to be desired, but the bits that I could understand matched the subtitles almost exactly.  Being aware that in other films, very notably My Life as a Dog, there were a couple places where the subtitles were a pale comparison to the Swedish dialog, I can see where this could be a disappointment to those who had seen the theatrical release.  Nevertheless, since it was the DVD version that mesmerized me to this extent, I would advise no one to skip the DVD offering for this reason.  It's plenty good enough as is, far better than most.

I do not even watch True Blood.  This movie is very original - the only vampire movie where the vampire is a 12 year old girl.  The two 12 year old actors who star in this movie were great and I see a work in the movies for them in the future.  One of the signs of a good movie for me is if I really care about the characters.  I cared about the two main characters in this movie one of whom is a 12 year old female vampire.  I actually felt sorry for her a bit!  How could you not have sympathy for Eli?,1279497600,,736,3.8733333333333335
3703863,4,B001MYIXAW,"I saw a few other reviews and saw them mentioning the subtitles and ""theatrical subtitles"" soon. Well, on the copy I bought in the store 2 weeks ago had ""theatrical subtitles"", so I guess I got that one? I am not sure but I tried the dubbing just to see how it would sound and that lasted about 5 minutes. It was just horrible. I use subtitles anyway but I always want to see how they do the dubbing. Yikes, it was painful.
Anyway, I got this movie based on the reviews and how some people had said it was good. I am not big on vampire movies I admit. I am kinda mixed on this movie. I liked it cause it was a different take on vampires (not that the vampire was odd but that the story was not a generic one) but it was a little slow. I am cool with movies that are not all about gore and action but this movie was even a little too slow for me. I didn't get parts of it either and maybe that was the translating? I REALLY didn't get the part where he see's the girl changing and her vagina appears to be sewn up. I even had to go back and slow it down cause I had no idea what I was seeing. I know some cultures do that to girls to keep them chaste but I wasn't sure what relevance it had here. That part threw me for sure. Maybe someone knows what it means, not sure. Wasnt sure about the ending where the kid just ups and leaves with the girl. There were no words spoken really but it was just an odd thing seeing as how he was what? 11? All in all it was a good movie but for those looking for constant gore or lots of action, don't watch this.

My big beef was that while the movie was just fine, the audio/subtitle situation is awful.  The original film is in Swedish.  The disk says there are subtitles, but they don't actually appear, even when the characters are reading Swedish.  What's left is the awful dubbing, which is just comically bad and a constant distraction and spell-ruiner.  Heck, even if you can understand Swedish, you can't get the Swedish audio, which was deleted entirely on the U.S. release.

DVD needs to be seriously redone.",1277337600,,643,4.781818181818182
3703866,5,B001MYIXAW,"Most vampire movies these days are terrible. They've swapped out the terror for the bedroom tease and gone about defanging the monster into an emo person with long canines. Such things give me strange twitches and thoughts of doing things that no one expects on their whiny butts. Like the Spanish Inquisition. With the dishwashing rack. And a spoon.

Then there are those that actually remind you that yes, this is a monster that can eat you and not feel particularly bad about it. The idea of friendship around this kind of vampire gives a certain kind of uneasiness about the stability of the human involved. Let the Right One In is an example of this sort of horror.

Oskar is a misfit in his life, lonely and bullied at school. Eli moves in next door with her ""father."" There's a string of murders and attempted murders that Eli's ""father"" has been committing to keep her fed. In the middle of that mess she and Oskar start talking and become friends.

I can honestly say that I am dumbfounded by the number of things to get uncomfortable over. Oskar's incipient necrophilia... Eli's ""father's"" pseudo-pedophilia... Eli's pseudo-pedophilia...  Now take into account that the film is eerily quiet for the most part and most of the attacks are are done as very long shots, with the action taking up just small part of the frame. Nothing quite like a feeling of cinematic isolation to give someone the creeps. Even most of the attacks are shot from a distance away, probably to emphasize the outsider themes running through the film. Neither Eli or Oskar really have friends. Then there's the detail that Eli starts encouraging Oskar to hurt and get back at the bullies after she sees him pretending to confront them with a knife. It would be a very ""stand up for yourself"" moment... if I could shake the suspicion that she was checking him out as a replacement for her decoy dad.

This film is somewhat slower paced than some may like in their vampire movie. I found that the slower story pace worked as a means to give the audience time to get distinctly uncomfortable. The attacks are unheralded by non-diagetic music and further supports a feeling of unease and uncertainty. It's rather amazing how well, just having a quiet film lends a sense of apprehension to the story. There aren't going to be any clues for the audience that Eli is going to attack someone as soon as they turn a corner. There's nothing really to prepare for the scene with the bullies in natatorium. I enjoyed the degree of care that went into keeping the suspense going throughout this film.

Curiously the film became more disquieting the more I thought about it later. It took time for some of the themes to percolate through. I think that's the mark of a really good horror film.",1276732800,3,2762,4.661190965092403
3703867,5,B001MYIXAW,"Wow.  Someone's actually managed to make an original vampire movie.  I'm not a big fan of vampire stories, I've just seen it too many times.  But this as good as it gets.  Beautifully shot (and great looking on blu-ray), moody, mysterious, emotional.  This is as much a pre-adolescent love story, as anything.

An outsider boy, fragile, picked on, and harboring violent fantasies of revenge is befriended by a strange, pale young girl who doesn't
seem to feel the Swedish cold.

It's a strange and fascinating mix of tones; bloody, gory killings, very sweet, well acted pre-teen romance, and occasional black comedy.  There's also an interesting, complex morality here.  Both our young heroes have deeply violent, sadistic streaks within them.  Yet we root for them, even though some off her victims are truly innocent, and he collects stories about murder like a nascent serial killer.  It grew even deeper emotionally on 2nd viewing.

One note re the subtitle controversy - the UK blu-ray has the correct subtitles, and plays just fine on US machines.  At least it did on mine.",1276560000,3,1079,4.960893854748603
3703868,5,B001MYIXAW,"I saw this movie originally on my Netflix instant play and can only say it is possibly the *best* vampire movie I've ever seen. While detractors might say that its not in English, the film captures the native Swedish accurately through subtitles in the ""theatrical subtitles version."" There has been a lot of controversy over the subtitles of this dvd since it came out. Apparently Magnolia had a company do the subtitles for the dvd release and these did not capture the nuances and intricacies of the actual dialogue from its theatrical version. Fortunately, this has been fixed and amazon has confirmed that they are now selling the correct ""English (Theatrical)/Spanish"" subtitles version. I just bought it a few days ago and can confirm this is indeed the case.
The film: its really a coming of age story in which a young boy meets a lonely young girl living next door. she only comes out at night and they develop a strong bond, as both are marginalized, one by bullies in his school, the other by her vampire nature. The film never gives you the impression that vampirism is a good thing or even explains how the little girl became one, but somehow that is not important. The movie is about the humanity of the characters and the existential drama that plays out. Its heartfelt, touching and in parts sentimental without being melodramatic or whiny (Twilight). I believe it was nominated by the BAFTA's for Best Film.",1276300800,3,1424,4.769230769230769

3703870,4,B001MYIXAW,"What to say?  This film isn't scary at all, but it does have a lot of atmosphere, it is intriguing, and the idea is a very good one.  The best vampire film ever?  No.  But one that should be seen.",1274486400,,196,3.825
3703871,4,B001MYIXAW,"""Let The Right One In"" has become a very popular Swedish cult film based on a vampire novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Tomas Alfredson did a fairly good job of directing. After reviewing some clips on line I was intrigued enough to buy the DVD. I should know by now the promo clips are always much better than the actual movie.

""Let The Right One In"" is a bit of a twist on the usual vampire genre. I wouldn't say the movie breaks new ground though. Boy befriends female vampire. Boy is threatened by bullies. Vampire friend protects boy. Boy and vampire live happily ever after. For me the movie was interesting enough to make the experience pleasantly entertaining. I enjoyed this cult film much more than your typical big production Tom Cruise cookie cutter film.

I wouldn't give the film 5 stars though. Even 4 stars is a stretch. The film has some minor continuity errors that don't amount to much. It's hard to tell if twelve year old Kafayre Hedebrant, the leading ""man"", is really acting or just being a 12 year old boy having a good time on set. Lina Leandersson does a respectable job in the vampire role. The chemistry between these two actors does come through on film. It's that chemistry between twelve year olds that makes this movie memorable.",1274400000,2,1260,4.595555555555555
3703872,5,B001MYIXAW,"The more I mull over this fascinating film the more I'm convinced that all the hype and praise it received (being toted as the best vampire movie ever) is accurate.  I mean, I am not a vampire aficionado by any means, but I have seen a few of the more well regarded vampire films and this one blows them all away for me.  There is just such raw and sinister relevance to this poignant story that I can't help but hold it in high esteem.

I really, really need to read this novel!

The film tells the story of a young boy named Oskar who meets a young vampire named Eli.  Oskar isn't aware right off that Eli is a vampire, but they bond due to a mutual feeling of exclusion.  Eli, being a vampire, is reclusive almost impulsively and has no real companions outside of a man named Hakan who takes care of her by killing men and bringing her blood.  Oskar is a small and wimpy young boy who is constantly picked on and finds himself internalizing his rage in wild fantasies of killing the boy who is harassing him.  That is how Eli and Oskar meet.  One night while acting out his frustrations on a defenseless tree, Oskar is approached by Eli and they soon strike up an unlikely friendship.  This relationship takes them through mutual hardships and helps the other to grow in areas they are struggling.

This is very much a love story that is far less about love and more about affection.

When one dissects the core of this film they find so much more than they bargained for, or than they initial thought they'd discover.  This is far more than just a monster movie, this is a beautiful depiction of adolescent angst and the need to find someone to share in and thus alleviate your pain.  There is also a lot here that is so subtle and merely hinted at.  I have read on some of the novel's broader scope and I love they way that this film insinuates a lot while leaving the majority of the back-story to your imagination.  Eli is a mysterious character, but there are plenty of hints to her story dropped for us to nibble on.  These tidbits add to the layers of pain in her eyes and the emotional depth we see in her undead soul.

""If I wasn't a girl...would you like me anyway?""

The subject of revenge and childhood alienation and subsequent domination is given proper and enlightening treatment as we consider Oskar's situation as well as the similar yet contrasted state that Eli finds herself.  Eli is very much like Oskar, yet she is a matured variation of him (beings that she is 200+ years old) and yet she maintains the same need for vengeance that he feels at his young age.  This detail tragically shows that pain etched on the skin of the young very rarely fades with time.  Oskar's undeniable desire to be older himself (he knows his age to the day, which is a tell tale sign of someone counting the days until something better) is also a tragic detail, showing the loss of youth in today's society.  With all the pain and all the heartache, our young ones are chucking away what should be crucial years of their development for adulthood.

The title of the film alone (English translation being `Let the Right One In') is a testament to the level of emotional relevance this film carries.  The title refers to the emotional bond between Eli and Oskar, a statement referring to letting one in emotionally.  Throughout the film Eli makes it known that she must be invited inside, and this is metaphoric for the need she has to belong and or be wanted.  The same is true for Oskar, and once Eli begins to share her truth with Oskar it becomes apparent that she has `let him in' just as he has `let her in'.

Carrying the film's heavy themes, young Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson (both making acting debuts here) are astonishingly effective.  It doesn't hurt that director Tomas Alfredson baths them in a sea of rich metaphoric light.  Alfredson allows his actors to become one with the imagery, creating a beautifully complete film.  The attention to detail is simply breathtaking.  From the score to the cinematography to the script to the acting, everything is a perfect compliment of the other.

This film is truly haunting, but not in that generic horror way.  `Lat den Ratte Komma In' is far from generic.  It is intoxicatingly real, a film that shies away from the clich&eacute;s presented in this overdone genre (the characters are real and gritty as apposed to sexed up and artificial), giving us something with a purity rarely seen in a film containing this much bloodshed.",1273708800,7,4498,4.517923362175526
3703873,5,B001MYIXAW,"Is this worth paying the inflated prices quoted by third party sellers? No - but, this can be purchased for much less on amazon.co.uk. This is the UK version of the movie and fans of Let The Right One In will appreciate the commentary from the director, Tomas Alfredson (this movie actually marks his directorial debut in the horror genre) and also the author John Ajvide Lindqvist.

""Let the Right One In"" is a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but 'Let the Right One In' is so-well directed and well-cast that all of these themes fall seamlessly into place within the almost 2 hrs running time.

I was riveted from beginning till the end, and the one word that kept coming back to me as I watched this movie was ""hypnotic"" - the story is of 12-year-old Oskar [Kare Hedebrant] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Oskar doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Oskar meets a strange girl named Eli [Lina Leandersson] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Despite this, the pair are drawn to each other, even while Oskar updates his scrapbook with the latest news of gruesome murders in his town, where the victims are tied up and strung upside down before having their blood drained. Much later, Oskar who is by now completely infatuated with Eli, learns a shocking truth that has some important repercussions on both his friendship with Eli and for those around him.

""Let the Right One In"" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Oskar & Eli learn to manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role - Eli commands Oskar to stand up for himself, and later Oskar finds himself in the role of Eli's protector.
The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire - ""I must be gone and live, or stay and die"" - a young yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.

""Let the Right One In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see.",1273622400,3,3069,4.688311688311688
3703874,4,B001MYIXAW,"This just came in the mail today and I got the theatrical English subtitles. So it looks like they are shipping the better version in the Philadelphia, PA area.",1272931200,2,160,4.551724137931035
3703875,4,B001MYIXAW,"When I first saw Let The Right One In... I didn't know exactly what to think about the film. I new that it would take me sometime to get it to sync in. There was something about the movie that kind of left me unsettled. I'm sure some other folks were just as confused when they finished watching this film as well.

The movie itself is pretty good for what it is. Low budget so don't expect any amazing special effects. The characters are pretty strange that includes Oskar who for some reason gets these ridiculous ""orgasmic"" close ups. Meaning he seems to be making these ""ecstasy"" expressions on his face at random times in the film (one when he's being whipped by bullies) just really strange I never got the joke if there was one.

The acting is pretty good for what the film is. Although with the odd closeups I thought they'd pick a cuter girl to play Eli because her facial expressions where on par with Oskars.

The story is where it gets complicated. I watched this on the Amazon English dub version. So I guess that's as good as it gets than reading subtitles. I'm not going to knock the film down because of that though. I watch plenty of subbed anime and I admit those old dubbed kung-fu films so bad dubbing doesn't bother me all that much. The story is based around a wimp named Oskar that meets a ""girl"" who is really some sort of vampire like being that survives off blood. She has some oddities about her that Oskar picks up on but over looks because he has no friends and anyone that notices him is someone worth forming a relationship with.

The Girl Eli befriends him eventually after sharing a few moments together on a couple nights in the courtyard. She starts giving Oskar advice and he takes it to deal with his current ""bully"" problems. This part is especially funny as the dub features some of the bullies with female voices. I'm not sure if they are supposed to be girls or boys as they look like boys even at this point.

Note: next 2 paragraph have a minor spoiler...

The two start a relationship as friends and Oskar being a naive adolescent boy begins to fall for Eli as she is the closest thing he will get to a woman. Throughout the movie Eli keeps saying that she's not a girl...even though apparently she does appear to be one. Then in one scene she even sleeps naked with him and tells Oskar again she is not a girl. This is what was very confusing as you would think Oskar would ask more about that but he never does. So your lead to think that Eli is just referring to the fact that she's a vampire and not a human and no longer considers herself a girl.

WRONG! I actually had to research the film and found out that it was based off of a book (like 90% of movies are). In the book it's noted that Eli or Elias is actually a ""BOY"" who has lost his genitalia through some ritual or whatever have you (yeah random as hell). So he has been living the past 200 years or so of his life as a little girl.

This is the part that turns me off about the plot itself... mind you not the movie as it's good... just the plot. Elias is a 200 year old Man that looks like a 12year old girl, and basically is seducing a 12 year old boy whom he went so far as to sleep naked along side, and even passionately kiss at some point in the movie.

This part about the film is what made it not settle right with me. To think that some 200 year old vampire is seducing young boys for his own personal interest is pretty disgusting. The film is great because it really does beat around the bush (literally) and you kind of never get it until you research on your own. Once you do it's an entirely different movie. The real horror is knowing that Elias is preying on young Oskar's emotions. I'm sure it's not the first time Eli has done this but it's what he does to survive. There's a few moments in the film where we see Eli as he truly is ""an older man"" but it's never made clear.

The thing about the movie that is the strangest is that you don't know if Eli is in love with Oskar or if he/she is just using him to suit their desires. That is never made clear but what is made clear is Oskars affection for Eli.

Overall it's a 4/5 movie worth watching and checking out. The story however with me will remain to be a bit disturbing once you find out the secrets on your own nonetheless.",1272585600,3,4307,4.202179176755448
3703876,2,B001MYIXAW,"I read the book and enjoyed it, although for me there was too much emphasis on the relationships / trials & tribulations of school kids, and not enough on the lore and activities of vampires. Some creepy scenes, but not a particularly scary read for me as compared to Salem's Lot by Stephen King or They Thirst by Robert McCammon. I then rented the DVD, hoping the movie format would increase the tension and fear factors. No such luck. I found the movie so boring that I never made it all the way through. The acting was stiff, the dialogue wooden, the characters shallow with little development and no charisma, and the action tedious. In the book, the little vampire girl was described as beautiful with delicate features; in the movie she was plain with a big nose. The boy was supposed to be overweight and pale; in the movie he was pale and lean and platinum blond, like a star waiting to grow up. No innovative cinematography or sets. I do NOT like overly gory movies where all you see is slice and dice, but I do like suspense, a sense of ominous evil that you the viewer are dying to see defeated, and a set of ""rules"" constraining the monster that make defeat a possibility. These rules might be a vulnerability to stakes in the heart, aversion to daylight and garlic, etc. It doesn't really matter what they are, as long as they are consistent within the reality portrayed and so make the story believable. This movie only had time to portray some psychological background for the children described in the book; the vampire story is pretty scanty. Sorry I rented it.",1271203200,2,1578,4.559859154929577

I really enjoyed the fact that they didn't go over the top with effects, it was very refreshing, (take a hint Hollywood)  The story was magnificent and I thought they did a great job converting the script for the film, the Hakan sub-plot was both scary and revolting and I think it would have changed the tenor of the film dramatically, I like them both for what they are.

A young 12 year old girl named Eli (Lina Leanderson) and so called father Haken (Per Ragner) move in next door, it seems he has found an answer to his sollutions. His parents Erik and Vyonne (Henrik Dahl and Karin Bergquist) are having some problems but Oskar seems to be the one with the most problems with some other kids picking on him at school and in town, however murders have been occuring over the last days since Eli and Haken moved next year. Later Eli reveals herself to be some sort of vampire that feeds off the blood at night and has remained 12 for 200 years as Oskar doesn't seem to care.

A brilliant work of art! this Swedish import is a gory and romantic horror drama vampire movie that is based on a popular Swedish novel. This is one of those rare vampire movies without the use of fangs or some of the Dracula mentality yet they can still be burnt by the sun and there is gore around here. The love story works here because they are 2 preteens who have little in common yet they find their love to be a little forbidden yet almost in a sexual way, there is even a hint that Eli may or may not be a girl which is subtle but this is one of the most original yet unique works of cinematic art in recent memory. Came out in the year of the vampire 2008 where stuff like Vampire Diaries, Twilight and True Blood came out, this one just picked a right time to come out and is one of the must see movies ever.

This Blu-Ray gives viewers the authentic theatrical feel even with it's sweet surround sound in Swedish with english subtitles and even a very nice English dub track. The extras are few such as deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage, and photo & Theatrical poster galleries. A must have for vampire and horror movie fans, but i can't believe an American made remake comes out this year but on the other hand it's produced by Hammmer, so that shouldn't be too bad.

Now I'd like to comment on this issue with Amazon not guaranteeing wheter you get the original 'dumbed-down' DVD/Blu-ray subtitles or the corrected theatrical subtitles the film had in the theaters. THere's nothing like creating a crapshoot as to which one you get when you buy it. WOW, great customer service there, Amazon!!! This is an major issue for some people, me included. I ordered the Blu-Ray a year ago online from Wal-mart with the original bad subtitles. While I was waiting for it to arrive, I learned about the controversy on the web. So, as soon as it arrived, I refunded it at a Wal-mart store before I opened it, and have been waiting for a time when I could be sure I got the theatrical subtitles.

So here's an idea, Amazon. Sell the original subtitled version for $9.99 and continue selling the theatrical subtitled version for $15.99. This would be a great way to show some consideration for your customers concerns.

I can guarantee I'm not buying it ANYWHERE until I KNOW I'm getting the theatrical subs. In the meantime, I can watch it instantly on Netflix with theatrical subtitles.",1269388800,8,1193,4.698564593301436
3703886,5,B001MYIXAW,"After reading a few other reviews stating that Amazon finally has the theatrical subtitled version in stock, I decided it was time to pick this up. I received my copy today and certainly received the theatrical version! I cannot guarantee you'll get the same version (the disclaimer at the top of the item page seems to indicate that), but it does seem that they are shipping this version more often than not at this point.

Also, I want to note that the Amazon Unbox version that is included with your purchase (as of this writing) disappointingly has the home video subtitles, and after watching this version of the film for about 15 minutes, I had to stop. The home video subtitles literally feel like you're reading ""See Spot. See Spot Run."" Atrocious. For anyone that gave this film a low rating and this is the version you saw, you owe it to yourself to re-watch this film with the theatrical subtitles. It makes all the difference in the world.

Now, on to my actual review...

Movie:
As far as vampire movies go, there hasn't been a lot of innovation over the years. We have hokey Dracula pics, very dark Nosferatu style films, action movies like Underworld and Blade, and (God help us) teen dramas like Twilight. And, for the most part, that's pretty much been it. ""Let The Right One In"" is something altogether different. This film is very personal, and seems to touch on a portion of the vampire mythos that gets glossed over in most films. The vampire in this film (Eli) is purely evil, and I use the word ""evil"" in its most literal sense. Eli is a terrifying creature. But having said that, Eli also has a desire to experience and remember what it was once like to be human, and in that regard, this is also the most strikingly human vampire I've ever seen in a movie. The contrast between Eli as purely evil and also grasping to hold on to what little humanity she has left is very moving, disturbing, and heartbreaking. More than any other vampire movie, ""Let The Right One In"" makes you believe that a creature such as this could actually exist, which is possibly the most frightening aspect of the film. Instead of resorting to blood and cheap scares to frighten you (although there certainly is blood in the film, this is still a vampire movie after all), this film frightens you with your own emotions.

Blu-Ray:
I'm not going to go into a ton of detail here, but I will say that the picture and audio quality is phenomenal. You really get a sense of the intensity of the cold through both the crisp visuals and the subtleties of the audio. As cannot be stated enough, you absolutely must get the edition with the theatrical subtitles (as indicated by the ""ENGLISH (Theatrical)"" tag on the back of the case). You are doing yourself a serious disservice by watching this film with the god-awful home video subtitles.

Bottom Line:
This film may not be for everyone. This isn't a Hollywood vampire film by any means.

For the majority of the film the supernatural aspects are understated, leaving the superb acting, writing, and direction to shine through. You almost forget you're watching a vampire film. At once disturbing and yet moving, fantastical yet realistic, Let the Right One In is a stark meditation on friendship, bullying, and yes, vampirism.

3703889,3,B001MYIXAW,"This movie is based on the best selling novel by john Ajvide Lindqvist. He also did the adaptation. Without spoiling the film, this is not the traditional vampire movie (like the Hammer Films with Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing). While there are traditional components (blood thirst, unnatural strength, fangs, inability to tolerate sunlight) it is definite not the typical tale. Interestingly it reminds audiences of one of the original parts of vampire folklore. Vampires can only come into a room when invited; hence the title. There is definite horror and gore here so it isn't some preteen girl goth version. In brief, Oskar, an outcast loner teen age boy lives a miserable life. One night a middle age man and a girl, Eli, moves into the apartment next door. Soon, Oskar forms a bond with Eli because of their shared isolation from society. Of course during all of this, various horrors are also occurring.

Is it THE GREATEST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER? No, but it is very good. It is very Scandinavian movie, and has long shots where only a bleak setting is shown. Viewers who are used to the quick cut pacing of movies like Saw may find these moments tedious. The are some fantastic scenes. Without spoiling the film it handles the denouement in a brilliant understated way. Other scenes suffer from probably limitations of technique and cost. Several of the scenes in the book are set in dark and poorly lit settings which makes filming difficult. Some of the scenes therefore lose some tension because there are nice modern street lamps or walkway lighting in the background but probably the film makers had to do the best they could. It was filmed in a real settings and doesn't look like they could afford to build elaborate sets.

Is the book better? Yes and no. The book has many subplots and fills in a lot of details that are glossed over or ignored completely in the film. The sense of mood is also more strongly developed. The feeling of helplessness and hopelessness is much more clearly developed. The final confrontation however is handled in a very original and clever way and the last scene is an improvement on the book. So, try to see the movie and read the book.

Is there some theme or meaning? Yes, monsters are not born, but created; often spawned out of cruelty.

Will this film be remade for US audiences? Yes, reportedly (IMDB) the guy who did Cloverfield will be redoing this film and it will have Chloe Moretz (upcoming Diary of Wimpy Kid and Kick-Ass) as Eli.",1268524800,,2489,4.714942528735632

3703891,5,B001MYIXAW,"I like horror.  Good horror.  Horror stories and films that make you care about the characters.  Original stories, also, stories with a unique approach.  Stories with a lot of atmosphere.  Stories and films which create tension and dread with subtle means, stories which target the subconscious of the reader/viewer.  At least three of these qualities should be present, the first one being essential.  LET THE RIGHT ONE IN has many of these qualities.  I saw this movie a couple of months ago in the theater (a terrible copy) and couldn't wait to see it again, for I knew there was much in that film still to be discovered.  I bought it on Blu Ray and watched it again, and wasn't disappointed.  For many reasons.  It's a strange film which can be regarded both as a youth film and a horror movie.  It's a film that doesn't rely on cheap gore and (by now predictable) shock effects.  It uses CGI sparingly, only when necessary.  The photography/composition is singular (European?).  The locations, season (cold winter), interiors create an atmosphere of alienation, of mental desolation.  The music is a unique blend of suspense and melancholy.  And then there are the characters.  Young teenagers, timid, uncertain, desperate for some love and sympathy in a cold (war) world.  The acting by the two main characters is remarkable, modest yet convincing (not to forget the eyes and voice of Eli (Lina Leandersson), this alone is worth seeing this horror film - and on Blu Ray it's even more mesmerizing).  The pace is slow, yet the film never bores, for the characters get you under a spell.  Scandinavian films have a great tradition in psychological study and youth cinema, which shows in LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  So, I wonder, why does this film need an American remake?  Big bucks, of course.  I'm not going to see it.  Something which is splendid doesn't need a remake.  I simply don't want to spoil the magic.",1267920000,3,1913,4.773700305810397

First time I ordered the movie right when it came out and was dissapointed when I saw how different the subtitles had been.  One thing I noticed though, the english dub does use the correct words for the theatrical subtitles.  Unfortunately just terrible voice acting.  So, very grateful this has been corrected as far as subtitles actually being moreso what I saw in the actual theater.  I hear some people are still getting the first version.  Okay, this might not be the most honest idea but if you do get one of those, don't open it, buy the correct one from your local target, walmart ect.  then return the one you got from amazon to the store you bought the correct one from if you didn't get the right one.

3703898,3,B001MYIXAW,"Film: Empire magazine's Kim Newman compared this film to Victor Erice's 1973 majestic opus The Spirit of the Beehive. I can't think of a better parallel: Each film is as graceful and authoritatively affecting; and just as Beehive faintly honors the grandeur of the story and heartbreak of Frankenstein, so does Let the Right One In tribute the entire lore of vampires and the corresponding stories of its written and spoken history through gentle underscores in the film's own narrative. As you've heard -- and as you will always hear from anyone who's seen it -- Let the Right One In is only a vampire horror picture on the outside; beneath its surface is an intricate, deeply intimate, and ironically life-avowing story of love (not only of the romantic bond between one individual and another, but of a deep passion for the nature of people and things as they relate to the development of the universe). A staggering film. Film grade: 10/10.

DVD/Blu-ray: The first (and only, thus far) print of Let the Right One In, from distributor Magnet, is a product that should be avoided indefinitely. In their attempt to make a ""more pure"" translation of the film's original English subtitles, those at Magnet have doubtless loosened its tension and lessened its overall impact. Magnet has been promising a reprint of the product since April of 2009, though has not made any progress in either detailing its projected release or confirming distribution.

Because of Let the Right One In's caliber as a motion picture -- one strong enough to survive a moderate subtitle issue, but one that will increase drastically once the issue has been resolved -- and its ghostly availability in its theatrical form, viewers too eager to see it before its indeterminate re-release won't be completely wasting their money by purchasing this product.

3703899,5,B001MYIXAW,"First and foremost, my Blu-Ray copy of this film that I received today does have the English (Theatrical) subtitles label on the back. My guess is that Amazon is probably including a note to their distributors at this point to be sure to send out copies with theatrical subs. Enough bad reviews and customer complaints/returns have to make a difference eventually. While I have not seen the other version with the bad subtitles, I definitely feel for the people who received those inferior copies. Movies like this certainly do not deserve to have the intent/emotional weight of their dialogue ruined by subtitles obviously catered to ""illiterate American"" audiences. Which brings me too my next point...

Let me say first of all that I am a huge horror film fan. I have viewed and enjoyed horror films classic and new, and am certainly not a fan of the mainstream remakes and formulaic crap that gets dished out to our wonderful theaters as a result of lowest common denominator film making and the word of ""test audiences."" Having said that, this is very likely my favorite horror film of all time. Unconventional in every respect, and skillfully ambiguous enough to illicit multiple interpretations for each viewer. It features brilliant photography and lighting, wonderful performances by the child cast in particular (a rare feat that is better accomplished here than in even some of Spielberg's films,) great analog sound design, a chilling score, and an emotional resonance that stays with you for days after seeing it. The fact that they are remaking this near perfect film irritates me beyond belief, not only because it is a masterpiece as is, but I honestly believe that this is a film that could honestly speak to a wide American audience. It features characters that anyone can relate to in some way, and I can't imagine this plot being set in a different cultural context. Maybe the remake will re-spawn interest in this achievement in modern film making, but then again, what did Quarantine do for (rec)? Nothing. I believe that everyone should see this movie, especially those who are not generally into horror films. This film breathes new life into a genre that has become somewhat stale in the USA, and has certainly been recognized for it. It is no accident that this film has a staggering 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, and that its future transformation into an American remake is so detested. Now is the best chance to see this wonderful and beautiful film, especially when the Twilight series is currently setting the standard for vampire romance films right now. Pay attention Twilight, this is how it is done...and as a further note, this was done first. Bravo!",1266364800,3,2680,4.916114790286976

For me it was more than just a love story between two children but about acceptance of another's differences. About knowing one's inner strength and if you're lucky having someone in your life who is going to always have your back.

Maybe it is just a love story.  I don't know.

But I envied Oskar finally having someone enter his life that almost from the start was rooting for him to be the strong person that he is.

3703902,4,B001MYIXAW,"Allow me to explain how so. The movie is definitely a fresh take on the vampire mythology. No arguing with that. It's bittersweet, but, first of all, it's greatest achievement is that it manages to be a universal love story in spite of the darkness that surrounds it.
Eli could very well be one of those rare, but ordinary people who come into our lives and makes us overcome our own issues, empowers us, loves us for what we are. And are there when we need a little ""hand"".
It's also a story of people (i'm not saying children on purpose) who belong to different worlds overcoming and accepting their differences to be together. it's unique on its own right.
Definitely not ""the best vampire movie ever"" like some promptly say; the film does not delve into vampirism properly, it's barely a ""vampire movie""! It's just a movie that happens to feature a vampire as one of its leads. But vampirism is not the focus of the story. If You want to take a look at the vampire world, you go after ""BS's Dracula"" or ""Interview with the vampire"". But if you come to LTROI expecting a vampire movie, you might be disappointed.

3703903,5,B001MYIXAW,"Stop! Spoiler alert! Do not read on if you don't want any spoilers! Let The Right One In is not a typical vampire movie. There is nothing typical or ""Twilightish"" in it or  a silly Vampire in a cape running around in a castle with a coffin hidden in it,intsead what one has is a thoughtful,disturbing tragedy and a film that strangely enough seems to have strange similarities to the 1980's Swedish film Barnens O.Both Barnens O and this film are Swedish films set in the early 1980's and have characters that look amazing similiar as they traverse a strange landscape which ultimately end in a rather strange life or death struggle in a pool-the sililarities are really amazing. In both stories,the main character is told through the eyes of a 12-year old boy. In Let The Right One In the boy is named Oskar. He happens to live next door to a girl who turns out to actually be not a girl or a boy -though a boy who is not a boy since Eli is undead,sexless  and has been been this way since the late 1700's using his power of mesmerism to find one caretaker after another to care for him since he was casterated and left for dead centuires ago and them ""saved"" by a Vampire and given undead life. What one is left wondering most about by the end of the film is if Eli has idenditified himself as a girl,does he love Oskar or is Oskar just under a spell to become the next caretaker for a creature that just uses all humans for his purposes?.Does Oskar chose to ignore the fact that his ""love"" is a boy and not a girl and not even alive or is more of the Vampires power over him? And what of Oskar's fate-is he doomed to age and grow old while Eli remains young forever and will Oskar come to the same fate as Eli's older caretaker...alot to think about in this film.

""Let The Right On In"" was one of those movies.
I've been a huge fan of ""Interview With The Vampire"" for many years and in my mind, that really is THE definitive vampire movie.
So, my first impressions of ""LTROI"" weren't spectacular.
I thought it was boring, drab and pardon the pun...lifeless.
So, after debating this movie with a friend a while ago. I decided to watch it again.
And.....

I think I missed a lot of the subtle things that the movie offers.
You know, I went from writing sentence long reviews to writing reviews that bordered on ""phone book"" size.
I'm trying to get to somewhere in between the two.

What did I like?
Beautiful direction.
Colorless and drab environments that really are a reflection of the vampire herself.
The acting itself was top notch.
My favorite scene is near the end, the hospital scene.
I won't spoil it but it was the coolest scene in the movie.

What didn't I like upon the second viewing?
Not much.
Like I said, sometimes a movie just doesn't click with me the first time around.
The second time was a charm.

While everyone who has seen the trailer will know that this is the story of a small snow-bound Swedish town haunted by a vampire, what is truly awesome about it is the fragility of each character, and how they all crumble in one way or another. Eli's sacrifices, Oskar's sacrificies, Virginia's sacrifice, Hkan's sacrifice...  The film is beautiful and minimal, and we care about all of the characters. The love story between two 12-year-olds is somehow quite believable. The theme of bullyism is a bit clumsy, and provides a bit of non-vampire action.

The weather is cold and snowy in some far off nordic country, but no one seems be aware of this as no one seems to wear hats or gloves. The buildings are made of steel and concrete and the interiors are as bland and unappealing as the weather outside. In the midst of all this starkness are two 12 year old kids who share a common bond of being on the outside of society. The boy is bullied and beaten by the neighborhood kids and the girl lives in a sparsely furnished apartment whos sole mission in life seems to be living day to day off peoples blood. This is not your typical hollywood dracula movie full of action scenes and drama. In fact the film is eerie. People are discovered dead in the snow but the police never become part of the movie and the few neighbors who suspect the girl are dealt with by the girl's supernatural powers.

3703916,5,B001MYIXAW,"Let The Right One In is the other vampire/love story film that came out in 2008 next to Twilight. While I'm probably one of the only men over the age of 18 that didn't HATE Twilight I CAN say that it being a Vampire/romance story is where the similarity ends. Twilight was fun teen-angst junk food. Let the Right One In is a masterpiece of filmmaking.

Let the Right One In is about the relationship between 12 year old outcast Oskar, who's regularly bullied at school and dreams of revenge, and Eli a vampire living next door who befriends Oskar and teaches him how to defend himself. While the characters are younger their story is much more mature than any other vampire relationship in cinema (or television for that matter).The performances of Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson as these two leads are a wonder to behold, even more so since they were both only 12 when they made this film.

I also love the atmosphere of movie. There's music and special effects but they're used sparingly with the camera work to create a very normal looking town as the film's setting. There are a few jump-out moments but they're handled so off-handedly that you almost don't realise what you're seeing until it's already happened.

While the film was adapted by the book's author John Ajvide Lindqvist, it omits alot of exposition of the novel focusing mostly on the friendship of Oskar and Lina. You won't have things spelled out for you (especially with the supporting characters), there's no real vampire lore or how Eli's survived for over 200 years with her 'guardian', and there's no inner monologue to explain what the characters are thinking. Personally I think this was a brilliant move on the filmmaker's part letting the audience think for themselves and letting the camera work and actor's performances do most of the storytelling.

One thing alot of people complained about on the DVD was the subtitles. When the film was released on DVD it left out the theater-translated english subtitles. They've now rereleased the DVD with the theater subtitles. While I didn't find the subtitles on the original release to be that bad, I now own BOTH DVD's and will say that the theater translation is the preferable one. Just look on the back of the DVD case to make sure it says English (theatrical) under the subtitles heading (though I think that's the only version being sold now so you should be safe).

3703922,4,B001MYIXAW,"""Let The Right One In"" is not a typical vampire movie.  The more I think about it, the more I think that it shouldn't be viewed as a vampire movie at all.  It's a story told through the eyes of a 12-year old boy (Oskar).  He happens to live next door to a girl (Eli) seemingly his age, but someone quite different from him.  Of course, she's a vampire.  Oskar is constantly bullied at school.  He has a fascination for true crime stories and clips stories about murders out of the newspaper and saves them.  In a lot of ways Eli is his alter ego.  She's everything Oskar isn't.  She's strong and can be quite violent.  The two form a bond and spend a lot of time together in the dark of night.  Oskar eventually finds out about Eli, but is surprisingly unafraid.

Interesting to me was how ""sloppy"" Eli was at keeping her secret.  Vampires need human blood to live, and Eli is no different.  However, her kills aren't especially cunning.  Whether she's doing the killing or her human confidant, neither seem to be professional enough to get away with it for long.  Rather than taking homeless people or going after people in rural areas, their kills are very close to home and in rather populated areas.  Bodies aren't disposed of properly either.  I kind of liked the fact that everything wasn't covered up so neatly.  It gave the movie a much better feel of realism.  The movie is shot very well, and although dialog is both subtle and limited, the story is expertly told through visualizations.  Lots of credit to director Tomas Alfredson for resisting the temptation to do more.  The movie should be approached like a fine cognac.  Rather than just tossing it down quickly, one should take it slowly, enjoy the aroma, and sip.  This movie needs to be taken in as it is presented.  It's a little on the slow side, so don't expect anything exciting to happen.  Notice the setting, how things are shot, and appreciate the sadness the main characters are living with.  If you love film and view it as art, this movie is for you.  It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking.  If you expect a huge romance (Twilight), a lot of action, or a ton of suspense, you'll be disappointed.  If vampires were real and living among us, I'd like to think this is how life might be for them - especially for a 12-year old girl.

On a side note:  forget how the adults act in the movie.  Tomas Alfredson states in the special features that the adults are perhaps there but absent at the same time because the story is seen through Oskar's eyes.  Perhaps this is how Oskar views the adults.  Knowing this after the fact helped make sense of a few things.  I would have liked to have known this ahead of time.  Hopefully this helps you too.",1262131200,,2716,4.458248472505091

3703926,5,B001MYIXAW,"Let the Right One In is a 2008 vampire movie from Sweden that received overwhelming acclaim from those who saw it. An American-ized remake is due out in 2010, probably due to the vampire-frenzy created by the awful Twilight Saga. The movie-world has been overpopulated with vampire movies lately, but this film serves as that little glimmer at the end of the tunnel; a film that uses the vampire mythology to tell it's story, without ruining the mythology. It's a film that tells a story quite similar to the one told in Twilight, except it's more poignant, more violent, and much more original.

Kre Hedebrant plays Oskar, a 12-year-old boy with no friends; he's a strange kid, seen playing with knives and acting out violent situations, probably directed at the bullies he's frequently tormented by at school. Outside of his apartment building, Oskar meets a strange, 12-year-old girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson) who has recently moved into the building with an even stranger man (Per Ragnar). It's no spoiler to tell you that Eli is a vampire.

This is not a ""vampire"" film in the traditional sense of the word, however. The film is much more interested in the relationship between Eli and Oskar, who begin to bond in a strange, initially disconnected way. It uses the idea that Eli is a vampire and Oskar is a human in the same way Twilight did, but the two characters are both 12-years-old. That's where Let the Right One In really succeeds. In this relationship, there's actually a poignant representation of a relationship between two pre-pubescent children, vampire aspects notwithstanding. Both are (technically) at an age where they haven't quite reached a level of sexual understanding, but there is a certain understanding of some sort. Their relationship is much more touching and poignant that the silly Twilight drivel.

Both Hedebrant and Leandersson handle this material exceptionally well and, being the stars of the film, they're required to carry it...They do so quite admirably, especially when one takes into consideration that they're the same age as their characters.

Looking beyond that, the story is just very well told if you have a little bit of patience. The story drew me in, although don't expect all your questions to be answered right away or, in some cases, at all. Despite the relationship angle, it's still very much a horror film that exercises much restraint on blood, gore, and special effects. There's a particularly chilling use of makeup in one scene, but other than a severed limb and some blood here-and-there it relies more on atmosphere (particularly it's gray, somber setting), poetic cinematography, and a haunting musical score.

It's an eerie, effective film that is simultaneously haunting, violent, and beautiful. There are those who will find it slow and uninteresting, but it's really a quality piece of horror cinema. Anyone who has grown tired of the tired, clichd ""vampire-romance"" movie will find this to be a welcoming breath of fresh air...It's an outstanding film, that truly deserves to be called ""a work of art.""

3703928,4,B001MYIXAW,"I vaguely remember ""Let the Right One In"" being released in the theaters in the fall of 2008. Unfortunately, it did not receive wide acclaim from the public, even though it gained many awards and was a critical success. Plus, it was probably in the theaters for all of three weeks. It's just more evidence that a film that has subtitles, takes a little patience to watch and may not have enough gore, cheap scares or car chases can be easily dismissed. Perhaps ""LTROI"" will gain a larger audience via the DVD/Blueray route. Let's hope so.

The story has been covered by many of the other reviews here - a 12 year old boy, Oskar, bullied at school, lonely from being emotionally disconnected from his divorced parents, finds friendship, strength and trust from a new girl Eli, who moves in to the apartment next door with her guardian/companion, an older man named Hakan. Eli is also twelve. And she's fragile looking, pale and only seems to come out at night. Their first encounter is kind of creepy but they continue to meet each other in the playground of their apartment complex. They bond over a Rubik's Cube of all things and slowly gain each other's trust and understanding.

The two young actors, Kare Hedebrant (Oskar) and Lina Leandersson (Eli) both give genuine, wonderful performances. I would've paid much money to see a whole film of scenes with just their two characters interacting.  One of the best shots in the entire film lasts for only about 15 seconds but shows how lonely Eli feels when she tries to suppress her need to communicate with Oskar via Morse code through the wall that separates their two apartments. And there is another great scene where Eli pleads with Oskar to try and see life through her eyes. She's clearly the wiser of the two, for good reason.

Director Tomas Alfredson and screenwriter John Ajvide Lindqvist (on whose novel the film is based) focus more tightly on Oskar and Eli's story than getting involved with too many minor plotlines that are in the book. This is really not a horror movie. It's more of a drama mixed in with some horror elements. Even so, there are a few moments of dark humor as well - one involving an inquisitive dog and another with some suspicious, hyperactive cats. The cinematography is quiet and lush. And the film is beautifully scored with moving compositions by Johan Soderqvist.

I'm reading the book right now and it's quite enjoyable as well, though a bit darker than the film. For those who like the film and want some more details, or a more fleshed out story including motivations of minor characters, the book is highly recommended.

3703930,4,B001MYIXAW,"First of all, sorry with my english as i am french. I do my best with the grammar errors.

The criticism over the supposedly bad subtitles is clearly, what we call in french, a tempest (or a storm) within a glass of water. Much ado over nothing.

If you are going to keep yourself from seeing this great film because of the subtitles, you are depriving yourself from one great experience.

C'mon you guys!

Are you all little children? Do we need to hold you by the hand? Are you so childish that you can't get pass poor translations?

I've seen the famous blog site that every one is talking about where one person who clearly has too much free time on his hands compares two versions of the film with two versions of subtitles. Yes, there are differences. Even one that is sad (the morse code one with the word ""s.w.e.e.t."" being one of them).

But you know what?

It does not matter! You nerds! If you're watching foreign films, it means that you are willing to have these margins of errors in the translations. How d'ya know for sure that your ""right"" version of the subtitles is the closest to the real film? Unless you speak swedish? If you're watching foreign films with subtitles, it means that you're a true movie lover, even a so-called ""intellectual"" of cinema. It then means that you're an educated person, probably even intelligent. Well then, it means that you are aware of the different mind set that is required whenever watching a foreign film with subtitles. You know darn well that you are going to be missing important aspects of the dialogue. From language to language, meanings differ and expressions are not always the same. When you watch a foregin film, you are suppose to prepare yourself mentally. You are suppose to open your mind a little bit more. You are suppose to let yourself be absorbed by the general atmosphere of a scene rather then by every little choices of words.

If there were differences, i don't feel like i've missed anything. I got the point of the movie anyway. And i'm not better than anyone else.

I'm french (from Montral) and i watch a lot of french films from Europe and from Qubec (Canada). Sometimes, for the heck of it, i put on the  english subtitles just to see how much different the meanings are. Well, my friends, they are! But in general, you get it anyway.

FCor examples, in ""I Come In Peace"" (with Dolph Lundgren), the bad alien keeps saying ""I come in peace"" before killing his victims. At the end, the hero kills him after saying ""Well, you go in pieces!"". In french, you can't do this play-of-word. Instead, the hero replies ""well you will give us peace of mind"". He says it in french of course and it does rhyme with ""I come in peace"" (in french). In ""Running Man"" with Arnold, he lifts a bad guy over his head and drops him by saying to him ""Wanna lift?"". In french, he says ""Wanna play airplanes?"" (in french, it's an expression we use). You know what? These replies are even more funny in french than they are in their original language and it doesn't really change the rythm of the scene. We ""get it"" anyway.

To sum it up, don't listen the nerds who are boycotting this version of the film and buy it anyway. Don't miss this film. Believe me, you'll ""get it"". You won't be ""lost"". You'll probably even say ""What the hell was that fuss all about?""

After all, you are an intelligent person. You are watching a foreign film with subtitles. You know how to prepare for it. How to have the right mind set.",1260403200,7,3475,4.470774091627172

Unless I happened to view the updated version with theatrical subtitles without knowing it, but I didn't see anything particularly flawed with them. There were some odd spots that, if I had the flawed version, may have been better explained in the theatrical subtitles, but the story worked for me.

I didn't know how long Eli had been ""alive,"" but a synopses of the film at IMDB explains that she/he was 200 years old. I don't recall learning that fact during the movie itself. That, and a few other odd bits aside, Let The Right One In was very different and entertaining.

You can gather what the film is about by reading any detailed review, or plot synopsis, but what you won't learn is how unpredictable, bizarre, and dynamic is turns out to be. In fact, what made this more unpredictable for me is not knowing what it was about before I saw it. Somehow my brain ignored the word ""vampire"" on the cover, and I had a very different notion in my head about what I should expect. That worked in my benefit, because I learned what the film was about as it unfolded. When the subject matter of a film is not readily apparent the audience won't really know what to expect.

It was dynamic in the sense that the slower parts were well balanced with periods of intense action, horror and scares, but there wasn't a consistent rhythm. That is handy if you want to keep people guessing, and unprepared, but it can make those slower, dramatic parts seem too slow, or unwelcomed at the time.

The atmosphere was great. Creepy locations, and a wintertime setting worked well. Excellent framing and camera work help tell the story and keep the viewer interested. A few minor sub plots give us a little more to be interested in, and blend well with the main theme.

I would watch this one again. It's a great film with enough gore, blood and neck shredding for any horror fan, but enough art to make it an intriguing art film.",1260144000,,2016,4.512328767123288

3703942,4,B001MYIXAW,"I just finished John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel yesterday and was interested to see how the story was captured on film so I watched the DVD last night. I have to say this is one of the rare cases where I actually liked the film better than novel, but I have to qualify that by saying that if I hadn't read the novel, I wouldn't have enjoyed the film as much as I did. Does that make sense?

The basic storyline is that 12 year old Oskar is an outsider, bullied at school, living with an overbearing mother and he fantasizes about killing his classmates. Eli is a young girl who moves in next door to Oskar and the two strike up a friendship. But Eli is an outsider as well...for much darker reasons.

Because I'm not into spoilers I won't say any more. I do recommend you read the novel before viewing, you will get much more from the film that way. Also, if you are hoping this is another ""Twilight"" keep looking. ""Let the Right One In"" is actually more of a drama than a horror film.

I think the movie clicks for so many reasons, Lindqvist adapted the novel himself and wrote the screenplay. The novel is so melancholy, and Lindqvist adds a few touches to the story that help lighten it up a bit. Don't get me wrong, this isn't going to be ""the-feel-good-movie-of-the-year"" no matter how you cut it, but it's not steeped in the morose tone that the novel is. Simply becuase of the 2 hour running time, quite a few aspects of the original story are altered, glossed over, or left out altogether. I have to say I was disappointed Hakan's story was cut short and altered and I would have liked to see Eli's back-story included. But I understand the reason for their removal.

I think the reason the film worked so well, and why I enjoyed it so much was simply the acting performances turned in by the two young stars. Kare Hedebrant as Oskar does a great job! The young actor's expressions, the emotions he conveys with simply looks were amazing, you really felt for Oskar. And to top it off, Lina Leandersson as Eli is equally as good. I was very interested to see who the cast as Eli. She had to be sympathetic, but also have that edge of danger and mystery that make the character so enjoyable. Lina captures Eli perfectly, at times seeming much older than 12, yet still maintaining a child-like quality. The two young stars do such a great job, I can't picture anyone else attempting these roles.

Which leads me to this, watch this version of the film. From what I understand, Hollywood has gotten their hands on this thing and you just know it's going to be watered down pap. The title is even being changed to ""Let Me In""...is this the Big Bad Wolf story??? Knowing how Hollywood works, they will probably cast a couple kids from the Disney Channel, pack the soundtrack with crap by American Idol contestants, and have the kids wearing all black to show how ""deep"" they are.

Pick this up, make sure you get the corrected subtitles, and simply enjoy.",1256169600,3,2955,4.432780847145488

this time of the year, a mesmerizing chiller.",1255824000,2,512,4.604395604395604
3703945,3,B001MYIXAW,"It's taken me a long time to write a review of this film after seeing it. The delay came not from the daunting praise that's been heaped upon it (well over 60 international award nominations/wins), but by the film itself. It also has ...something ...about it that lingers in the mind; something that I'll try to hit upon while writing this review.

First let's talk about the movie's genre. It has often been mislabeled as horror. It isn't. It has very few horror elements and should never be cast into that bloody pool (those who've seen the film will get my pun ...I hope). Yes, there's the vampire construct from the beginning, but this vampire film is far different than those that've come before. It is touching in the adolescent sense and numbing in the way the story unfolds and is filmed.

So let's talk a moment about the filming. Shot on-location in Sweden during the winter months, the color film is often muted by the black and white of snow and buildings. This gives the film a unique feel and a connection to the main characters (as they live in a black-and-white world full of knowns ...for a while), but it also makes the eyes of the viewer tired of seeing the same drabness. This is why I gave the film a bit lower rating than most. Although I know where and why writer/director Alfredson did what he did -- for the sake of his art --  I don't think it translated completely to the big screen.

The story, however, is pretty magical in that it takes an old genre (vampire films) and puts a new spin on it. The main characters aren't just young, they're REALLY young. Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is just 12 years old. Battling toward adolescence, he is small for his age and is ridiculed and tortured by fellow classmates. One can only imagine the amount of anger bottled up inside him. But we don't have to imagine it ...because it shows up in the form of a 12-year-old girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson), an aged vampire forever locked in a young body. The two form a friendship based on puzzles (Rubik's Cube) and their need to connect with someone their own age. For Eli, the connection is a much greater need (as we see by the end of the film). But for Oskar, it must feel just as great.

And speaking of the end, there's a surprise waiting for those who make it through the film. A big one. The ending, when spoken about in movie circles, is often said to present more questions than answers. Was Oskar just a pawn for Eli? Something she needed to survive? Was Eli even real? Or was she a dark figment of Oskar's personality that manifested itself via murder? It is a dichotomy that will not be easily un-puzzled.

And herein lay the reason it took me so long to review LET THE RIGHT ONE IN after seeing it: I didn't know how to respond (myself) to that ending. But one things for sure, it stuck with me. I remember every word the two main characters spoke and recall all of the mixed angst and beauty they represented. It definitely sank a fang into me.",1255651200,4,2970,4.420475319926874

3703950,4,B001MYIXAW,"For most people who have ever been bullied in or out of school, this is a highly enjoyable Fantasy Film: 12-year-old Oskar (Kre Hedebrant) has a small female friend named Eli (Lina Leandersson), who can advise him and, when that fails, can protect him. Having a vampire for a friend is a bit like having your own tiger: very handy.  One is led to assume that Oskar is not even the second of this female's ""best friends,"" nor will he be her last.

The casting is excellent, and the story arc is cleverly disclosed to us. Even the bonus features are well done.

My chief reservation about recommending this enjoyable film to friends and family--and even strangers--has to do with an image that appears on screen at 1:30 (i.e., 90 mins. into the film): it SEEMS to be a 3-second instance of child nudity (the camera SEEMS to be focusing on a young girl's naked crotchaka Kiddy Porn), occurring while Oskar is peeking in at Eli when she is changing her clothes.

Yes, in the original BOOK, I've read online, Eli supposedly is a castrated boy, not a girlbut in the MOVIE this never comes up as an issue, and certainly nobody watching the film who hadn't heard/read such a thing would come to such a conclusion from the 3-second glimpse. Some people online justify the nudity by saying that Oskar is a curious 12-year-old, and we are really only witnessing his interest in Eli's body. Others have said that, because Eli represents a creature much OLDER than a child, there should be no problem. STILL OTHERS insist that they've READ that the bare crotch is that of a mannequin and not a living personand therefore there's no problem.

In reality, of course, the actress Lina Leandersson IS really a child, and she is really being looked at by thousands of adults (the audience of the film)and as that scene is played, most of the viewers will assume (and are INTENDED to assume) that they are seeing her bare crotch. Anyone else care to comment on this??",1253750400,2,1948,4.6023054755043225
3703951,4,B001MYIXAW,"""Let The Right One In"" is a thoughtful, introspective movie about an unusual friendship, peppered with some effective and striking horror imagery.  While not overly ambiguous, the film definitely leaves it up to the viewer to decide if the young boy's friendship with the undead girl is ultimately a good or bad thing.  A brief subplot involving a middle-aged woman who survives an attack by the girl and starts transforming into a vampire herself is a memorable addition to the film.  Especially recommended for those who like their horror set against a backdrop of mundane, realistically presented daily life.  The standard DVD looks and sounds fine, and gives the viewer the option of seeing the film in the original Swedish with English subtitles, or dubbed in English.

But if you haven't seen do yourself a favor and check it out when the proper version is released.
This is one of the best films I have ever witnessed, an incredibly original story, two amazing performances by the young leads, who exhibit great chemistry, an innocent pure love story between two whose lives are not so great beforehand.
The necessary violence and how they cope with it...and the violence is not glamourized and is well done, and shocking in its realism.
The original score also is the perfect compliment and I would recommend you check that out or purchase it as well....one of the better ones Ive come across.

3703958,4,B001MYIXAW,"This is an engrossing, eerie pas de deux between two young people who warm to each other in the silvery cold landscapes of Sweden. My DVD automatically started to roll with English dubbing and no subtitles. The dubbing seemed fairly good, so I just left the DVD at this automatic setting. However I perhaps did get a hint of how any translating subtitles might have been very inadequate, because the title itself, rendered in English as ""Let the Right One In,"" doesn't seem quite right. It has a misleading Spike Lee declarative tone to it. Although it plays off a line ritually used by one of the character, it doesn't fit the sense or mood of the film.

However translation failings wouldn't seem to make a lot of difference here, because so much of the film's emotion is carried in the silences between the children. These two leads in the film, supposedly both pre-teens, present an astoundingly different view of youth than the one that most current movies and sitcoms typically present. At last, we have examples of young people who are not sexually precocious, wisecracking, and preoccupied with trivial consumptions. We are presented with a more Victorian view of children - quietly observant, unobtrusively intense, capable of profound attachments.

It's true that the capacity for such gravitas might arise from the fact that one or both of these children is perhaps actually decades, or even centuries older than appearances suggest. Through some brilliant photography and make-up work, the viewer can at certain moments peer at these children and find the ancient aspect in them. There's an exquisitely subtle shift from pre-teen to old soul that's simultaneously frightening, thrilling, and yet somehow strangely hopeful - or should I say ""sanguine?""

This film is at heart a unique love story. The children make a rare connection based on fond fascination and need. Looking down the road at what will become of them though, the viewer is left in a frisson of wonder. Which will prevail in the long run - the love - or the need?",1252627200,,2041,4.910144927536232

Entertaining films all, but -just- entertaining. Unfortunately, it seems most vampire movies that actually try to be poignant or artistic fall spectacularly flat and end up coming across as a mishmash of Hot Topic ""goth"" nonsense and softcore S&M, all topped with a huge dollop of pretense. ""Let the Right One In"" is probably the only vampire film I've ever seen that is actually genuinely affecting, heartfelt, and (dare I use an irritating buzzword?) spellbinding.

The plot of the film, in which a bullied, unhappy boy grows to love a mysterious, eternally young vampire, has been discussed at length in many of the other product reviews on this site.  I'll be the first to admit that it even sounds kind of trite on paper, but I cannot overstate how masterful the execution of this film is.  This isn't some overwrought, angsty drama club piece, but it is rife with genuine, palpable emotion that draws the viewer deeply into film's world.  All of this hinges on the incredible performances by the two young leads, bolstered perhaps by the director's skill at exposition through understatement.  Many loose ends (A great deal of which were resolved in the novel) are left untied throughout the film, but rather than detract from the movie, I found that leaving some aspects of the characters open to the interpretation and imagination of the viewer enhanced my enjoyment of the film.  When the credits started to roll there were only two things I wanted to do: a:) Watch the movie again and B:) Talk about it.

Much ado has been made of the issue of the ""incorrect"" subtitles attached to the initial DVD release of the film.  This is a legitimate concern: The DVD subtitles hack away at much of the film's dialogue, leaving little more than a stripped down gist of several scenes in the film.  Luckily, versions of the DVD with the proper theatrical subtitles have begun to surface, mostly (for some reason) at Super Target stores, where it is typically shelved in the IFC section of the movie department.  Look for ""Subtitles: English (Theatrical)"" in the spec box on the back of the package.  For folks who just can't wait for a version of the disc with proper subs, I'm happy to report that the unexpectedly well-done English dub track is more-or-less in line with theatrical subtitles.

In conclusion, if you're a fan of vampire films, ""smart"" horror movies, or drama, ""Let the Right One In"" is certainly worth your time.  Trust me, I generally detest ""artsy"" vampire movies, but this movie is so much more than that.",1252540800,3,3064,5.61822125813449

A story of two children who have difficult lives and find each other. As oppressed children will do, they bond through the crucible of shared pain and lonliness.

Oskar is a lonely, depressed 12 year old boy in a single-parent household. Bullied at school, he fantacizes about killing his oppressors. Eli is a young girl who has moved in next door. They meet under strange cicumstances and connect as children do with simple acceptance.

Soon, Oskar notices he only sees his new friend only at night. She doesn't go to school, is usually barefoot and wearing only short sleeved shirts outside at night even though it is in the dead of winter in Sweden and she, ""Smells funny"".

There are many quiet, intimate moments as these two children grow closer. There is a lot of communication between the two without words as children often do with one another. The simplicity of such moments projects a profound complexity of communion between the two through shared understanding and sensitivity.

It is a wonderful, touching story as each character temporarily escapes the painful, loneliness of their own lives with the shared companionship of the other. As trust builds between the two, they share a profound intimacy that seems to transcend the normal closeness between two people. They soon come to rely on one another more and more as time goes on.

However, as Oskar begins to feel the normal burgeoniongs of sexual awakening as an adolescent boy, he is shocked and astonished with the reality that the girl he has grown so close to, is a powerful, savage predator, capable of unspeakable violence!

The film has a thoughtful, intimate tone and draws you in as you are reminded of the precepts of vampire legend and lore. You are witness to their time together and the difficult circumstances they must cope with while apart.

The film builds to a shocking and interesting ending that is neither gratuitous nor expected.  I highly recommend this film to anyone!",1252281600,4,2222,4.9837837837837835

It shows in a very convincing fashion that being a vampire is a lonely rode to take. This movie is raw and gritty and since I know a little bit of the language they have much more to say the what the English titles read. But never the less from a vampire alternate reality reader and movie watcher this is really up in my top 5 movies and the book is for this year in the top 2.
If your looking for Vampire Fantasy this is not for you. But I do think it good for some one who has seen nothing but the supposed gift of mortality. In the glamor vampire movies they talk about the hunger that compels them to hunt. We have always seen a man or woman vampire angry at what had been done to them and the way the movie is set up you wonder why and what is it that makes them so angry at there makers. This movie could shine a lite on why one would not be happy with such a life style. This movie takes away all the nonsense of having blood banks all over the place this movie is set at the raw nature that the original story says. They hunger for human blood no animal will do, and the blood must come from the human at that very moment or at least before it turns cold. Its just a Vampire movie story brought back to the basics of it survival.

This film was GREAT ! I am someone who does not mind watching either the English or original language for most foreign films. I went for English language and really had no problem with it. The story itself tells more than what an actors lines are. Look at the actors faces, look at the scenery. I could watch it with no language and still enjoy it. A nice timid pace where I did not even want the movie to end. This is not your typical guy in a cape with fangs vampire film, this is something quite different. I bought this on a recommendation actually without seeing it the theaters and was supremely surprised of just how good the story and movie were.
Not to give too much away but there was some gore but nothing stomach churning (at least to me) and the film touches upon a loner who is being bullied by other kids in school. What this has to do with vampires is something you will have to see for yourself.
I did not watch the subtitles as I just went to the English language which I usually do just to see the movie. I do watch foreign films in original language as well...usually the 2nd time around just to see/hear the differences. I am not too terribly picky. Now I did read about the subs for the DVD release being sub-par because Magnolia did not buy the original subtitle translations or something like that..okay, but is that a cause for a one star * rating ? I rate movies on the movies not so much on what a DVD brings. It is good to tell readers what the DVD is but the rating comes off as don't see it and I am here to say that you should see this movie anyway you can. Watch it anyway you like, the DVD to me is worth getting because it is that good. So while there are * star releases for the movie, that is for the DVD release...Im giving this **** stars, because the movie is outstanding irregardless of what the DVD brings to the table.

3703968,5,B001MYIXAW,"This was such a great movie. I had absolutely no problems with the subtitles as many others had. I purchased this movie on the recommendation of a collegue of mine. The story is simply beautiful. First you are introduced to a young boy who is being terribly bullied and then you're introduced to a girl who seems very mysterious. Both boy and girl becomes friends and soon the boy seems to fall for the girl. What I like is the innocence of this movie. Nothing sexually provaocative but obvious in its intentions to show how two young children or young teens like one another. The only problem is one of them happens to be a vampire. I love the fact that you're never told how this younglin becomes a vampire and you're not told how old the vampire really is. However you are often left to wonder because of the maturity of the young vampire.

The best part of the movie is the end. In which I won't give away. But it shows what true love and friendship is really about. Risk.

The movie is quiet and shot mostly in the cold of winter. Which gives an eerie but young feel to it. It also opens opportunity for trouble for the young vampire. This is not Trueblood or Twlight (which I really dislike). It is a beautiful independent film that shows the humanity behind fangs in a different way.

The DVD I have had deleted scenes, commentary from the director, and different audio and language selections. As I said, I had absolutely no problem with the subtitles.

I think the movie may disappoint some moviewatchers who have to be constantly spoonfed every single little thing and so they may feel something was left out. But for the rest of us who like to think...it is a beautiful story indeed.",1251504000,2,1694,4.472491909385114
3703969,5,B001MYIXAW,"Frankly, I haven't liked many of the vampire movies that hit the theatres in the recent past. They had very little substance, apart from gore and blood. The only upside was the superb special effects. One did not however feel they were `real' characters, if you can use that term for a bloodthirsty vampire.
Into this arid cinematic landscape comes Let the Right One In, a Swedish movie that tells the moving story of a young vampire. The hauntingly beautiful story is rather simple - the vampire girl Eli (""I have been 12 for a long time""), develops a relationship with Oskar, a 12-year-old boy who is tormented by classmates at his Stockholm school. Their relationship blossoms in a frozen landscape, amidst the frenzy of murder necessitated by Eli's thirst for blood and Oskar's travails at school.  It is a voyage of discovery for both protagonists in the movie - they learn the finer points of life (and death) from each other.
The viewer immediately warms up to both characters, played brilliantly by the two first-time leads. It is hard not to sympathise with Oskar, who finally learns to `handle' his tormentors the hard way on Eli's advice. Eli is one vampire you do not hate - her life is one long struggle for blood, company and love. The film does have gore - but it is not the primary focus. It has plenty of blood, but in the director's hand it becomes the conduit through which the two characters bond. Oskar stands by Eli even after learning that she is a vampire. If that is not love, what is ?
In that context, The Right One is a love story par excellence. The one thing that could have prevented Oskar from reaching out to Eli instead becomes their greatest strength. In one instance, Oskar saves Eli's life from a potential killer. The would-be killer ends up being a source of blood for Eli. She repays her gratitude in the final sequences of the film. Indeed, the eerie swimming pool scene is one of the finest moments of horror seen on film recently.
As for the technical aspects of the film, the cinematography is nothing short of excellent. It captures the desolate and snowy landscape of Sweden so well that one cannot help feeling the cold. The special effects are excellent for a non-Hollywood film. I am sure they will have better special effects in the forthcoming American remake, but will it retain the `soul' of this Swedish masterpiece? The acting is uniformly good too. There is no doubt that two leads will get more roles in Swedish and foreign films in the future.
There is a great debate on the Internet about the subtitle translation, but I did not encounter any problems on this Optimum UK release sourced from Amazon UK. Having no knowledge of Swedish, I cannot say whether it is the best available, but it worked for me and I had no trouble comprehending the dialogues. Of course, one always has to take into account that in any language, there are subtle nuances, play on words and unique idioms and expressions that may not lend themselves so well to translation in to another language.  I have also not read the book, so I do not know how faithful the film is to the book (I know some changes have been done). But taken on its own, the film is well paced. This could be due to the fact that the author of the book has written the movie script as well.
Technically, the DVD is brilliant and the blu-ray must be even better. There were hardly any artefacts in the many night scenes. The sound is not demo material, but the engineers have crafted it well to match the `atmosphere' conveyed in the film.
In short, this is one film you should have in your DVD/blu-ray library. It is a remarkable piece of contemporary cinema, one that you would not forget for a long time. It will require the full attention of your mind - and the heart - for 110 minutes, but it's worth every second. Films like this come along only rarely, so treasure it while you can.",1251417600,3,3894,4.53769559032717

Anyway, one thing I take from this film is that the most normal people in Sweden are two 12-year-olds, one of whom is a vampire!  What a bunch of screwed-up people the rest of the characters are--from the schoolyard bullies, to the stupid teachers, quarreling separated parents, lonely losers at the restaurant.  Even the weather is a mess! The relationship between the two kids seems to be the only redeemable thing here, and it very movingly portaryed  It's all brilliantly done in the film and I give it my highest recommendation.",1250899200,2,706,4.754098360655738

I was hesitant, because, well, it was a critic. As I watched the movie, I was completely enraptured. The story is purely gothic, almost like a Grimm fairy tale. A young vampire befriending a lonely child, with a happy, or not so happy ending, depending on how one might view it. The young actors are excellent, especially the young actress who plays the child vampire. This movie is for smart people who love gothic flare. I highly recommend.",1250726400,3,612,4.572727272727272

Beautifully shot, restrained, and ultimately very touching (it had me in tears at one point), and it actually does justice to the book it's based on. And unlike most vampire movies there are no ridiculously beautiful vamps hissing and flashing their stupid fangs for no reason, which is a big plus in my book. I'm sick of constantly seeing glorified fashion models wearing all black and stalking in slow motion to industrial music. It doesn't ring true, whereas the characters in this movie do. They avoid all the common vampire cliches but still keep some of the mythology, and it works very well. There are a few points that were very prominent in the the book that aren't touched on or explained in the movie, but that's easy to overlook since they still do a great job of bringing out the characters and keeping the story intact.

I'd suggest you NOT buy the dubbed version, since it really butchers the script, but if you can hold out for the theatrical version with subtitles you'll be glad you did. This is one that you're going to want to see over and over again. I highly recommend it.",1250208000,2,1163,4.564593301435407
3703974,5,B001MYIXAW,"Reviewers like to tell you whether a movie is good or not, and whether they liked it or not.

But you want to know whether you'd like it...or not. Why should you care what I think, unless you know our tastes are the same? And you certainly don't want all the surprises in the film ruined for you.

So I'll try to help you decide whether to see this or not, without spoiling anything.

""Let the Right One In"" is, above all, a serious movie. The concept, the plotting, the cinematography, the casting...everything serves a serious purpose--something like a meditation on what it means to have to take others' lives to keep your own...and what it means to know someone in this position. Of course none of us are, or know, vampires, but at the deepest level we have all taken advantage of others to help ourselves in some way at some time. Except my spouse, who's a saint, of course, just in case she reads this!

There's also the moral complexity that comes with the fact that many people who do great wrong to others often have a tender side. The family man who's a serial killer, the concentration camp commander who's a great father to his own children, the poet/dictator. Others are just monsters 24x7, but most have some redeeming traits. And such people are far more interesting than the Leatherfaces of the world. Even Saddam Hussein wrote poetry and doted on this children.

There is enough violence in ""Let the Right One In"" to justify an R rating, but none is gratuitous, and much is off-screen, in the manner of a good Hitchcock suspense movie, rather than some gorefest. The blood you see is there for good reasons, not just to shock you or titillate you.

It was done on a low budget by Hollywood standards. The sparse special effects are good enough to advance the plot but they aren't going to wow you by themselves. The actors are not Hollywood-beautiful, though I think the casting is perfect.

The main characters are children--more or less--but it's not a film for children (unless they're unusually deep children, if you know what I mean).

It's also not a film for those whose moviegoing expectations are entirely based on big-budget Hollywood movies.
I'm not criticizing such movies--I've seen many & loved many--but this ain't that.

In particular, many moviegoers want everything explained. This film doesn't do that. It explains nothing, actually. Not because the director wanted to keep you in the dark...but because a lot in life goes unexplained. Someone cuts you off on the freeway, nearly killing you, then vanishes into the night. You never know why he did that, and you'll never learn why. There were reasons, but you're not privy to them.

That's what this film delivers. Mostly you see things through the perspective of a 12 year old boy, and rarely know more than he knows. And the children in the film don't deliver long speeches explaining what they're up to, why they're the way they are, yada yada.

One reviewer hated this film because nothing is explained. He couldn't accept the fact that not all kids are highly self-aware extroverted, eloquent chatterboxes. ""Where did you go?"" ""Out."" ""What did you do?"" ""Nothin'.""

These kids are average kids in non-average circumstances. So are the adults and other kids around them.

You might also be disappointed if you're looking for a hero to a admire and a villain to boo. This film has neither.

I loved the TV series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel."" Those have heroes, and their stories are the stories of the hero's journey. Their central characters are physically beautiful, their dialog is witty and knowledgable and often poetic. And the production values (after Buffy's first two seasons, which were shot in grainy 16mm) are great for late '90s TV. However, ""Let the Right one in"" is really, really different from these shows, and I'm sure it's equally different from Twilight.

Actually, it's a gritty, realistic vampire film, oxymoronic as that may sound. The closest equivalent to it that I can recall is the underrated Jude Law film ""The wisdom of crocodiles."" Or, more distantly, the Japanese TV anime show ""Vampire Princess Miyu.""

Finally, a word about the casting. The 12 year old boy is the whitest white boy I've ever seen this side of an albino. He perfectly embodies the quirky loner he portrays. The girl is also perfect, and while she's not Hollywood-pretty by any stretch, she has huge, hypnotic eyes--almost like the kids in those wretched Keane paintings you see at tourist art galleries, next to the clowns and seascapes. I couldn't think of any child actor today or earlier who could play this crucial part better. She's as well suited to this part as Peta Wilson was to playing La Femme Nikita in the eponymous TV series.

The working-class Swedes around them look the part perfectly as well.

The film isn't set in any beautiful urban setting, like you'd find in downtown Oslo or Gothenburg. It's set in a sea of utilitarian apartment blocks in a nondescript town, with the action taking place entirely in a Swedish winter. It's the beauty of bleak.

I loved this film myself, but I don't want you to get it or watch it unless what I've said here suits you. If you do buy it, please manage the expectations of those you see it with. The pace is generally slow by Hollywood terms--necessary to generate the needed atmospherics. However, the story is linear, and ultimately not obscure at all except for not explaining how the people you see got there in the first place. So it's not hard to follow at least.

It has now been several days since I saw this with my brother, who had the same feelings about it as I did. The film has stuck with me. You know how some films you see then forget the instant the screen goes dark? This isn't one of those. It's haunting.  I didn't actually figure out the true nature of the two central characters' relationship until the next day, after the film had percolated through my brain for a while. I won't say what that is, since I promised no spoilers. But it will send chills up your spine.

And here's one moment to look for. You know how vampires can't enter your home unless you invite them in? (hence the title of this movie BTW) Watch what happens in this movie when that rule is tested. You'll remember this scene for the rest of your life, and I'm not talking about gore.

UPDATE December 21, 2011

This small-scale masterpiece has stuck with me in the two years since I first saw it. And now there's an American version of the novel as well, titled ""Let Me In."" I'm glad it has a different title, because I believe both films will be around for a long time, and they shouldn't be confused with each other.

Seeing ""Hugo"" last weekend reminded me of the American version, since both have Chloe Grace Moretz in them. Being a sociologist by training, I'm fascinated by both the critical and consumer responses to the two movies. More people have seen ""Let Me In,"" as you'd expect, but ""Let the Right One In"" continues to have stout defenders.

In fact we now have Team Abby, Team Eli, and Team Can't We All Be Friends? I'm in the third one. I own both movies, I love both movies, and I think each is better than the other in certain things. Yet I've seen people write that one version or the other appalls them, or even disgusts them. Some have accused the director of one of the films of being a criminal for certain details in the film. And I'm appalled at so much ranting going on about two fine films that aren't in competition with each other.

After all, most serious filmgoers have seen more than one version of a bunch of Shakespeare's plays. I know I have.

Oh, and many go on and on about one film or the other being truer to the book. Why does that matter in the slightest? It presumes that the book is perfect, and that, moreover, screen adaptations can't bring anything to the party--their only job is to provide animated illustrations for the book. I find this absurd.

For example, ""West Side Story"" radically reconfigures ""Romeo and Juliet."" So does Zeferelli's (it's less obvious, but it does). Does that automatically invalidate each movie in favor of some BBC bare stage production delivers the exact text of the original? Of course not. And the novel ""2001"" is dry and obvious, while Kubrick's movie is majestic and inexplicit--and a great work of art, while the book is just a crutch for those who want everything spelled out for them in plodding prose.

The Rottentomatoes website aggregates critics' reviews of films, as well as reader responses. ""Let the Right One In"" garnered a 98% critical ranking, while ""Let Me In"" got a still very respectable 89%. Thinking about how ""Let the Right One In"" has stuck with me over these two years, I'm changing my own rating of the film from four to five stars.

The only place I fault ""Let the Right One In"" is, in fact, a place where it's truer to the book than the American version is. I can't discuss it without spoilers, so stop now if you haven't seen both movies (unless you've read the novel)

-- SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT -- SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT --

In the book Eli is a castrated boy originally named Elias. I haven't read the book myself, but I know this is true. ""Let the Right One In"" sticks to this, with a brief crotch shot of Eli (about as sexy as someone stepping on your foot) that makes the point. People on Team Eli claim that this is required to explain Eli's lack of interest in sex, and in Eli telling Oskar ""I'm not a girl.""

Fine, that's the novel. But if it were really going to be true for the movie, they'd have had to cast an adrogynous boy--not Lina Leandersson. She may not look like a young Ingrid Bergman, as Ms. Moretz does in ""Let Me In,"" but she is distinctly female--in her looks, in her voice, in her motions. Prepubescent boys and girls resemble each other far more than pubescent ones do, but they still look different. Very few are exactly androgynous, and Ms. Leandersson ain't one of them--and it's an insult to her to claim that she looks like a boy. And no, it's not the girl's hairdo.

So neither movie is really true to the novel.

And in ""Let Me In,"" when Chloe Moretz's character tells Owen ""I'm not a girl,"" there's even less question as to her gender--even though she's a very strong girl who usually does her own stunts in every movie she's in. But then Owen asks her what she is, then, and she hesitates, then says ""I'm nothing.""

That's a profound moment in the movie, and I just wish the Swedish version had played it that way. Of course Abby isn't a girl. She's a vampire. And that means she is, indeed ""nothing.""

As for Abby/Eli's disinterest in sex...hello, they're 12. It doesn't matter how long they've been 12, their human biology is and will remain on the other side of puberty as long as they, um, un-live. Most 12 year old girls--even when they aren't vampires--are not interested in sex.

Honestly, when I watch ""Let the Right One In"" I view Eli as a girl because she's played by a girl. You want her a boy? Have a boy play the part. There are certainly androgynous boy actors out there. But don't tell me the Swedish version is true to the book and the American version isn't. Neither is true to the book in this regard, and personally I prefer it this way--it makes for a better film IMHO, and I put it to you that both directors think the sam as I do, given their casting choices.

Some reviews say Eli being a boy means Eli's relationship with Hakan is chaste. To which I say not on Hakan's part. He isn't 12. Whether they're having sex or not his desire is there, just as Owen's/Oskar's is. And it is whether or not Eli is a boy or a girl, for that matter. Eli/Abby needs a mortal human blood donor (so to speak)/protector who loves her. In our species that includes a lust component along with other things. If it didn't our species wouldn't be here. In this regard Eli's gender makes no difference--though it probably affects her choice of blood donor/day guardian.

It also means she can't turn her protector into a vampire. No day guard then, and no hold over him either. And it needs to be a male, because human males are generally stronger, and they need to be stronger in order to hunt for the vampire--who doesn't want to hunt, which again shows how deromanticized this film's vampire mythology is. And I think it needs to be a male who isn't an enthusiastic serial killer, because such people are rarely sufficiently devoted to the well-being of a 12 year old child, vampire or not. It needs to be someone somewhat normal, but alienated--like Oskar/Owen.

Note also that Eli's residual humanity shows in her (I think of her as a her) sparing that one kid in the pool scene. I wish the American version had done that. I also thought the climbing up the side of the hospital was visualized better in ""Let the right one in,"" and what happens when Eli enters without permission, and in general I prefer the lighter touch ""Let the Right One In"" has with violence and CGI. I also prefer the fact that the woman Eli inadvertently turns chooses death when she realizes what she's becoming, while in the American version she just dies like an animal. That was another place where the American version should have imitated the Swedish one and didn't.

People argue back & forth about the way the American version cuts out subplots to focus on the protagonists. I'm fine with both choices, personally. Ditto the casting--two perfect pairs in my book. Moretz is going to take Scarlett Johansson's place when she comes of age--someone with true high voltage star power, sharp intelligence, rollicking sense of humor and wonder, a level head, and with action movie skills that means she'll probably wind up doing a blockbuster, then an art film, then a blockbuster, as so many intelligent actors do. I also hope to see Lina Leandersson in more films--you can't forget those haunted and haunting eyes, and the sureness she brings to a very challenging role for a 12 year old actor.

Lastly, some reviewers took the crotch shot and the implicit sexuality of the vampire-protector relationship (and, astonishingly, Oskar's frequent toplessness) as signs that the movie is borderline kiddie porn. I find this both appalling and immoral. ""Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor."" Publicly accusing someone of a heinous crime is itself a vicious crime unless you can prove it.

Back in 2004, several people in Mali were murdered by villagers because someone like these ""reviewers"" had spread the rumor that those people were vampires. In this century! And to call that utterly unsexual crotch shot pornographic is idiotic as well as libelous. But some people think about perversions all the time, and see it around every corner, behind every neighbor's eyes. It's a form of paranoia. That's how dozens of people were convicted of involvement in satanic chil abuse rings run out of daycare centers in the 1980. Many of those people were in prison for decades. But eventually every single one of them was found innocent and released. This is not to deny the problem. The turmoil surrounding so many Catholic priests in so many countries shows that sometimes there is fire where there's smoke, to be sure. But sometimes the beam is in the accuser's eye entirely, and that's the case here.

Bottom line: ""Let the Right One In"" is a great movie. I'd use it to teach classes in film school--especially to show that you don't need a gigantic special effects budget even when you're making a fantasy film, which this is really, despite its realism apart from the vampire part. I'd also use it to teach a class in situational ethics as well.

The story is chopped up and abbreviated (necessarily so, I guess, to get it into movie length), but for example: the story of Hakan -- absolutely central to the book and running from beginning to end -- is nearly discarded in the movie. And the stories of the gaggle of drunks -- Virginia et al -- is poorly addressed also.

The book is wonderful. The movie - not so much. I guess I could say it another way -- if you at all liked the movie, you should DEFINITELY read the book. It's substantially different and will greatly improve on and expand your interest in the movie.",1250121600,4,724,4.402985074626866
3703976,5,B001MYIXAW,"**The following review pertains to a DVD release of the film featuring the original ""theatrical subtitles"". I can't pass comment on the 'hacked about' subtitles that appeared on the original US domestic release DVD of the film as I haven't seen it; but I am led to believe that it vastly changes the timbre and tone of the film as much of the more nuanced dialogue is sacrificed. Seek out the original ""theatrically subtitled"" version where you can.**

Oskar is a bullied twelve year old who lives with his mother in a council estate in the Blackeberg suburb of Stockholm. His life is a painful litany of physical abuse at the hands of his peers, over-mothering, and impotent rage expressed through the collection of articles about serial killers from newspapers and magazines.

However Oskar's life is to be forever changed by the arrival of the new girl next door, Eli - who is something far more and also far less than she appears...

Tomas Alfredson's film of ""Let The Right One In"" is a lyrical, poetic, deliberately ambiguous adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel. Adapted for the screen by Lindqvist himself, the film is far more focussed on experience of childhood (through the travails of Oskar and Eli) and decidedly less focussed on the lives of tertiary adult characters such as the 'Sun Palace' regulars (Jocke, Lacke, Virginia, Morgan and Larry).

That is not to say that this isn't a faithful adaptation of the novel - it is. It's just that Alfredson and Lindqvist have quite wisely realised that film is a very different medium to literature and in paring down the sub-plots, and characters at work within them, they throw the themes and concerns of the novel into sharp relief in a way that would probably only have been possible to achieve through the medium of a television mini-series had they retained the depth and multitude of sub-plots and characters from the original book. Purists may bemoan the absence of a number of characters (Oskar's wayward adolescent neighbour and his rigid policeman stepfather are nowhere to be seen, and Hakan's obscene sexual predilections have been excised and his character subtly reinterpreted in a way that may suggest that he and Oskar may have a lot more in common than is at first apparent) and sub-plots (the zombie-style rampage of a character who has received Eli's sanguine attentions has been removed; and what has been perceived by many to be the novel's most controversial twist is vaguely alluded too rather than explicitly stated), but to my mind, this only strengthens the film as one focuses directly on the uniquely un-sugared vision of a world seen though a child's eyes. The only other film that I can think of that has so perfectly provided a window into the experience of childhood is Terry Gilliam's stunning,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tideland-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000KB4898/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tideland (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>

Performances are extraordinary. Lina Leandersson is perfectly cast as Eli and she uses her strange, otherworldly - but rather pretty - young face to dynamic effect. At no point did I relate to her as a child actress; she really 'is' Eli.  Similarly, Kare Hedebrandt perfectly captures all the naivety, rage and introspective joy of Oskar's lonely young soul.

The period setting of Stockholm in 1981 is perfectly captured. I grew up on a council estate in the UK in the early 1980's and was stunned by how the Swedish council estate in th film evoked the look and feel of my own experience growing up 'on the block'. Similarly, the fashions of the clothes and dcor of the time are perfectly evoked to the point that I forgot that I was watching a film made in 2008 rather than a period piece.

In terms of set-pieces, I was expecting a lot from this film, in particular from the swimming pool sequence towards it's end - and it delivered. Boy, did it deliver. That one sequence alone was worth purchasing the film in my opinion. It really did feel like I was watching exactly what I had envisioned when I read the book.

Although not to everyone's taste, if you're in the mood for a beautifully filmed, languidly paced examination of young love and the loneliness of childhood (or is it a chilling portrait of the emotional manipulation of an isolated, vulnerable young boy by a ruthless predator that just appears to be a twelve year old girl? or even an allegorical tale of the primoridal manifestation of a wounded anima?) with some oblique horrific overtones, then you could do a lot worse than to pick this film up.

A word of warning for more impressionable viewers though. This film has haunted my waking hours in the week or so since I've watched it and has effected me in a way that no film - not even Darren Aronofsky's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Requiem-for-a-Dream-Director-s-Cut/dp/B00005Q4CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Requiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)</a>&nbsp;or Gaspar Noe's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irreversible/dp/B00009W0U4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irreversible</a>&nbsp;- ever has before.

3703979,1,B001MYIXAW,"It's rare that I'll use such a strong term as `hate' having watched a film, mainly because I'm very choosy in the first place and try to weed out the abundance of claptrap out there by way of going with established filmmakers and critics reviews. It's also quite rare that I will go so completely against the prevailing opinion when I find myself disagreeing with it, but I find myself utterly in that situation here - I actually hated this film and I'm all the more confused when I look at the mass of rave reviews for Let the Right One In.

So let me try to explain why I feel this way. Firstly, I love slow burners, meditative films that take their time and don't resort to a big set piece every ten minutes to cover emptiness - however, usually what these films offer are interesting characters and plots to maintain interest and to have a point to them. Let the Right One In had neither of these. In fact I found the whole film completely devoid of suspense, drama, intrigue, atmosphere, in fact anything that could be considered impressive or make the whole exercise worthwhile in the first place.

The acting from the two main kids was utterly awful, very stilted and awkward. There was a general lack of dialogue in their scenes, they tended to just walk around each other, mutter something or hug and it quickly got very tiresome. And I'm sorry if this sounds a little heartless but why would the director assume that the largely adult (at least intended) audience would be interested in the development of a friendship between a couple of kids, even if one of them does happen to be a vampire?

My second problem with the film was that it had a major problem with it's flow. In fact, I would sum up the film as three of four dramatic set pieces linked by a lot of very mundane scenes of a lot of very mundane characters talking a lot of very mundane dialogue. And I feel the director may have also felt this, which would explain the reason for including the other character who begins to turn into a vampire after being bitten by Eli. Other than providing an opportunity to reinforce some vampire stereotypes and a dramatic death scene, there was no point that I could see to her even being in the film other than to perhaps offer an explanation (you know for the benefit of those who don't know what a vampire is!) as to why Eli doesn't go out during the day and does what she/he does to people. Her narrative thread otherwise had no relevance to the friendship between the two leads which was the main focus and `point'.

And the `dramatic' set pieces were downright silly - the scene where Eli kills the man in the bathroom was embarrassingly bad - not because it was low key but because it looked like a guy was playing a prank on his mates from behind the door. Even the swimming pool scene at the end didn't make sense - would the bully still bother to keep Oskar's head underneath the water while the rest of his gang were being butchered and decapitated around him?

I guess my last main reason for disliking the film was because it seemed to think it was a lot more profound and artistic than it was. In fact, throughout, when there was any dialogue it was extremely mundane - take the example in the hospital scene where the guy is at his wife's bedside - he starts talking to her about a stamp collection! What? It seems the director was just filling in dead time with hot air - and there were many many scenes like this. I'm sorry, but at the end of the day, this film said nothing remotely interesting about friendship or adolescent growing pains - sad lonely faces and handprints against the glass are not enough!

I found myself longing for an American version of the film so that I wouldn't have to sit through stiff acting and annoying dubbing....But then something chilling happened..I was transfixed by the story unfolding before my eyes, dubbing and all..This is a vampire tale with all the right ingredients: chilling atmosphere, mysterious lead characters, sinister & suspenseful moments, and subtle implied danger that turns to brutal violence in the blink of an eye. There is an undercut romantic element to the film but it comes off as bitter sweet rather than over lush like so many of today's pop art vampire teen trash movies. The action and violence are also underplayed which draws more attention to the characters and the mystery of the story line. The film works on so many levels that I found myself cursing the idea of an american remake despite my annoyance with dubbing in general.",1249171200,4,999,4.847953216374269

There is no way Hollywood could or will come close in replicating the overall mood or emotion this film conveys to the viewer or imparts on the viewer.

For me, it is incredibly rare to WANT to watch a movie more than once.  Not in this case.  At the present, I'm so enamored with this film, I'm ready to call it one of my top 10 favorite films of all time.

I've seen the dubbed version, 'dumbed' down subtitle version and the theatrical subtitled version of this film.  You simply must see a subtitled version of the film.

The movie centers around relationships.  The relationship between the two children, the relationship between the girl and her guardian, male/female relationships, and relationships between school children (or pack mentality).

We know that there is something wrong with the relationship between the young girl and her guardian.  The older man blindly follows the girls demands and yet there is a loving bond (not in a creepy way).  As we watch the film, we discover the truth of things and the new relationship between the boy and girl explains all.  SPOILER: We discover that the guardian was once in the same spot as the boy.

I enjoyed watching this movie and would recommend it to others who enjoy great filmmaking.  It provoked all kinds of conversation about the meaning of love, vampires (aka narcissists) and growing up.  Just know that it is not a fast paced, action packed vampire movie although there is plenty of gore involved.",1248134400,3,1178,4.810945273631841

Once the film gets going it is a fascinating film to watch - very much unlike the norm yet familiar enough to appreciate and enjoy.

This is a Swedish film presented with both Swedish and English audio tracks - the dubbing works OK and voice characteration with the lead roles (both children) fits well. It looks like it was filmed on site in a Stokholm suburb and not a studio production which suited me fine. It is a modern day story of a young 12 year old boy, Oskar, who is always getting bullied at school until his friendship with local girl Eli, who happens to be a vampire, starts to change his life for the better. Having a vampire as a best friend can have its drawbacks though. This is all wonderfully acted out by the two main protagonists and captured in HD for BluRay lovers like myself. The audio is English or Swedish 5:1 DTS HD Master and clear as a bell. The film is not a scary movie so much as a film of a haunting modern fairy tale or drama.

I purchased one at Target after buying a Blu-ray from Amazon with the dummbed down subtitles. The theatrical subtitles are better but they did not change my overall extremely high regard for this movie, i.e. I could not love this movie more than I already do!

If you've viewed the dubbed version of this movie, you have not seen it!
The dubbing in this movie is an abomination! The two young lead actors in this film are phenomenal.  The heart wrenching raw emotion these two kids were able to deliver was nothing short of miraculous!  These two unknown kids have delivered performances that blow our Hollywood blockbuster actors right off the screen!
The script is perfect, the musical score is haunting, the cinematography is stunning, the casting of the lead roles was exceptional, and the directing was flawless.
Every once in a rare while everything comes together perfectly while producing a movie, and a brilliant film like ""Let the Right One in"" is created.

One last thing, this movie is an adaptation of a book.  The director shows and tells the audience his own interpretation. To take what is shown and told in the movie and extrapolate it into a homosexual relationship between Oskar and Eli (as some reviewers have done) is preposterous!",1247270400,5,1364,4.956140350877193

There is one line and one scene that give this info but they are not 100% concrete), and Oskar knows this, which makes their pseudo-romantic relationship homosexual.  While this is not outside the realm of reason for vampires (Anne Rice novels for example), and in a way gives a little credibility to Oskar for accepting Eli as-is (this is a big point to the story), I'm more than a bit put-off by it.  Really the only things new are child vampire (though technically that was covered in Interview With the Vampire) focus and the sexuality issues of one. Bleh...

I'm a firm believer that foreign films are best watched (and listened to) in their native languages.  Sometimes the dubbed-voice acting just doesn't measure up.

When he decides to work out, he'll not only be 12 years old and more confident - he'll be 12 years old, complete with a body double on steroids - for those intimate, close up shots.

There's no fangs, no religious priests holding up crosses, no driving stakes in hearts, it avoids all of those vampire cliches and breathes fresh air into a worn out genre.  But I must caution those with American sensibilities, who might find some of the sexuality in the film disturbing since this is a Swedish film with a European take on sexuality.

This is not your standard vampire flick with a clutch of monsters running around butchering the countryside. The story is far more subtle and provides a unique perspective on the vampire myth. Patience is required, especially if you're expecting a typical Hollywood vampire flick.

I watched the dubbed version and would recommend a subtitled version (it seems a new subtitled release is expected) because I really prefer hearing the original actor's voices.

3704003,4,B001MYIXAW,"......THIS MOVIE.  ""let The Right One In"" is a odd and sometimes slow-moving film about the relationship between two 12 year old misfits.  The boy, cherubic-looking Oskar is bullied by his classmates. The girl, raven-haired and very pale Eli has been 12 for a very long time.  Eli is a vampire and a cunning blood-thirsty one.

The title of the movie is a reference to vampiric lore that a vampire can not enter a home unless invited in.  The consequence of a non-invitation is revealed in a graphic scene.

The movie follows this strange and potentially deadly friendship but Oskar and Eli are always there to help each other from life-threatening situations.

And the ending is ambiguous and details the future of Oskar and Eli.  But does it?

""Let The Right One In"" follows vampiric lore pretty closely except there are no crucifixes, no garlic, no coffins, but this movie doesn't need them.",1243900800,,894,4.790849673202614

I haven't felt this enthusiastic about a movie since Pan's Labyrinth. Lonely and tormented Oskar meets his new neighbor Eli, a dark and seemingly wise young girl at the hieght of his despair. They soon form a bond driven by their mutual disconnect with the world around them.

The greatest genre films somehow find a new approach, and the genius of this one is it's simplicity. All vampire stories are about loss of innocence, yet there always seems to be resistence to explore evil from the point of view of the truly innocent. In this story, we never really feel that evil exist in the heart of any of the characters, yet the tension is great. Even after the film's bloody climax, we feel that not all goodness is lost from our heroes. While we may feel conflicted about the outcome, we never doubt the goodness and purity in Oskar's intentions.
I purchased this version, and will likely purchase the one with the more proper subtitles. I would recomend this movie,and I'm certain that it will have a large following in the years to come.",1243814400,2,1192,4.596244131455399
3704005,2,B001MYIXAW,"Given the gushing reviews here and elsewhere, I had high expectations for this movie.  I expected to see a nuanced, innovative, and intelligent take on the vampire myth.  What I got was a movie so slow and disjointed, that it was nearly impossible to watch.

The movie's overriding problem is that nothing happens.  There is a complete absence of suspense; there's nothing at stake.  Suspense doesn't require over-the-top action or a ticking clock of doom.  Just a sense that the characters have a goal or some sort of motivation.

Clearly young Oskar, the protagonist, is an unhappy kid, bullied and isolated.  And yes, he fantasizes about the day when he will finally turn the tables on his bullies.  But the movie's producers, apparently mistaking ""glacial pacing"" for ""subtle,"" have crafted a movie that creeps so slowly, even the protagonist seems bored.  Perhaps Oskar is supposed to acquire his eventual courage through his friendship with girl-vampire next door, Eli, but their relationship meanders as aimlessly as the rest of the plot.

The vampire, Eli, played by Lina Leandersson is the strongest aspect of the movie.  Simultaneously creepy and sad, she's all vampire without the usual gothic Lolita trappings.  But as with everything else in this movie, much of her life makes no sense.

Why for instance does she need Hakan, her apparent Renfield?  As the movie demonstrates, she's more than capable of getting her own meals.  And Hakan, in addition to being a total incompetent, employs methods of procuring her a meal that are hardly subtle. In a typical town, with normal police, the appearance of dead bodies, drained of blood and stuffed in drainage channels would generate a lot of police interest.

In fact, as the body count slowly rises (slow being the operative word for this movie), people spontaneously combust, and sightings of a strange girl who attacks people are reported, the police are curiously absent.  In this cold little slice of geography, the police are apparently more interested in doughnuts than solving crime.

Further complicating matters is the movie's editing, which is jarring, often jumping erratically from one scene to another with no sense of conclusion for the previous scene.

The strongest element of the movie is the ending, which avoids the usual (read American) need to dish out justice to the bad guy (in this case the vampire), and which is also enhanced by a strong sense of ambiguity.

But Let the Right One In's complete lack of character motivation and suspense creates a movie, which while starkly beautiful, brooding and atmospheric, is ultimately as lifeless as a vampire.

(Note:  I watched the dubbed version, which I suspect is some of the worst dubbing ever, making the characters, especially the adults, look like blithering idiots.)",1243814400,10,2803,5.072052401746725
3704006,5,B001MYIXAW,"Let the Right One In (Tomas Alfredson, 2008)

When trying to convince my sister-in-law and daughter, both thirteen, to watch this fantastic film, at one point I got tired of trying to do so with my usual critical terms and just said, ""it's Twilight, but good."" Which, of course, scandalized them both, but when it comes right down to it, there are a great number of similarities between the two films' themes, but the execution is almost polar opposite. Film buffs will detect, for example, hints of Kieslowski in Tomas Alfredson's location choices. I defy anyone to say that about Twilight (and be able to back it up).

The plot should sound familiar, if you're in America (since it seems everyone in the country has either seen Twilight, read the book, or both): a young human falls in love with a young vampire, who returns that love, but realizes that a true match between them is impossible. Where Stephenie Meyer's sparkly vampires, on the one hand, want to be RomEmo and Juliet, it seems as if John Ajvide Lindqvist (adapting his own novel) simply said ""hey, how about we write your basic love story, but give it an undead twist?"" Ironically, the one that doesn't try so hard is the one, if either of them does, that will end up the classic. Oh, yeah, and Eli (Lina Leandersson in her first film role)? She don't sparkle. However, similar to Twilight, there's a scene where the human finds out what happens to the vampire during one of those times that are traditionally supposed to be bad for vampires. And, like Twilight, that scene is one of the movie's most memorable. But trust me, there ain't no sparkling.

I don't even know where to begin saying great things about this movie, so I'll start with the obvious: the two young actors playing Eli, the vampire, and Oskar (Kre Hedebrant), her human friend. I absolutely, positively cannot believe neither of these two has acted in professional movies before this. They are absolutely perfect in every way. Oddly, they remind me of Jude Law and Elina Lowensohn in The Wisdom of Crocodiles, though the roles are reversed (and yes, I do mean to imply there's tension of a romantic nature between them), and despite my love of The Wisdom of Crocodiles, Leandersson and Hedebrant are simply flat-out better in this film.

Then there is Tomas Alfredson. Unlike his stars, this is not, by any means, Alfredson's first movie. Before getting showered with awards from around the world for this flick, Alfredson had already won both TV and movie awards, most notably for his 2004 film Four Shades of Brown. This is the kind of guy who would likely, were he in the American system, never even consider making a horror movie. But then, I'm not sure there's anyone like Alfredson in the American system. Who's the last director you can think of in Hollywood who made a TV comedy series, a movie spinoff, gritty dramas, and a horror film staring a couple of preteens? That sort of thing doesn't happen in America. And we are the worse for it. (And when was the last time you saw Kieslowski echoed in a horror film? Look at the building in which they live--if the two movies had been made in the same country, I'd swear it's the exact same apartment block that sits off to the side of the block where all the main characters live in Dekalog. And it's not just the building--it's the lighting as well.)

I've already mentioned John Ajvide Lindqvist's script, but I should do so again, because it doesn't matter how good your actors are, you have to give them something to work from. And this script? Genius. It's everything that, I think, Twilight wanted to be and failed, both book and movie, so miserably to be. Everywhere that Twilight is ham-fisted, Let the Right One In is understated. As a result, the relationship between these two characters feels far more real than that between Bella and Edward, for whom the world essentially stops in order for the two of them to emote. The big difference, naturally, is that Twilight is essentially a romance, and is written in the way Americans expect a romance to be written. Let the Right One In, on the other hand, is a drama that contains romantic elements. The love story is less important than the characters who are involved in that love story; Lindqvist's characters are gloriously three-dimensional. Lindqvist took a lot of care to bring his characters to life, and it paid off in spades. Eli and Oskar are two of the most endearing characters in modern film, to the point that when we see Eli doing the things she needs to do to survive, there's no real horror involved; we can sympathize with the vampire during the vampire's least human moments. (There's one scene in particular towards the end of the film where this is particularly powerful, but it would be the mother of all spoilers to tell you what it is. You'll know it when you see it, and like the scene I mentioned before, it's one of the film's best. The sympathy that Lindqvist has taken the time to build is, one hundred percent, the reason this scene works as well as it does.)

I could keep going. Once I'd made the Kieslowski connection in my head, I almost dug out my Dekalog review as used it as a template for this one. (This was the result of frustration; I've been trying to write this review for two months, and every time I've tried, it kept turning to mush. What finally made it gel was the other connection, to The Wisdom of Crocodiles. I can't believe it took me two months to see that.) It's one of the handful--at best--of movies I've seen since Dekalog that has had an effect anywhere near as profound. And the list of movies that would qualify contains a number of immortals (most notably Satantango). It's obviously far too early to consider calling Let the Right One In one of the best movies ever made. That hasn't stopped the machine that ranks the IMDB Top 250, where this movie sits at #190 as I write this. Time will tell if it becomes the classic it currently promises to be, but on a more local scale, I can remember few ten-best-of-2008 lists where Let the Right One In did not appear. The reason for this is evident; it is, in every way, a superlative achievement. In the time I've been reviewing movies, which now stretches over two decades, I have given a five-star rating to less than thirty films. This one joins the pack. *****",1243814400,17,6324,4.601950354609929
3704007,5,B001MYIXAW,"First off, I wish people would not rate this movie, just based on the subtitle mess-up. The review box should be more about the whole content of the movie, and not reflect just one flaw. That being said, I do understand the frustration with the subtitles, as I have a copy with-out the theatrical subtitles. Thus I was forced to watch the movie in English (dubbed). I do plan on getting the version with the theatrical subtitles, but I still think this movie was awesome.

The story:
I have to admit it was slow in parts, but that does add to the overall feeling of the movie. It struck me as a cold (no pun intended), dark movie. The plot was not as slow, as within a short time the movie took it's first dark turn with the first murder. As the story progressed the relationship between Eli and Oscar became more fascinating for me. It seemed like Eli was Oscar's strength and yet Oscar was Eli's emotion. Yet the relationship between the two was almost sinister, urging each other to do things the other would not have done with out the other. This is manifest for Oscar in the scene were Oscar fights back in the park, and for Eli it is in the scene at the pool.

The production/music, ect. -
The production was good. It really set the mood of the movie, as did the music.

Overall-
Great movie. I really can't say it any other way. Watch it and decide for yourself.",1243814400,2,1369,4.33984375
3704008,4,B001MYIXAW,"if you're expecting a bloody vampire horror film this may not be it.
I think it's misguiding to refer to is as a horror film, but it's a hell of a love story.
Even though it deals with younger main characters, that in no way effects the impact of the story which is full of redemption.
Seriously, I'm not one who will seek out love stories etc. and have to admit I rented this due to belief that it was a horror/vampire movie. But I have to admit I'm really glad I was able to see it and will purchase it if I already have not. It really is one of the most beautiful and fulfilling love stories I have seen, which is not many, but none have stuck with me like this.
So give it a chance; and if you do like a good love story and were worried about gore etc. you should love it too.
also many have mentioned problems with the subtitles; the copy I rented from blockbuster was fine although I was not able to check the box to see if it was a revised version.

3704009,5,B001MYIXAW,"I would say 'the best', but come on: 'Nosferatu', even rabid fanboys must agree, is the all-time champ. This film, however, is also a classic-in-the-making, with as much thoughtful admiration of its subject as a great work of literature might have.

Yes, the subtitles were sadly lacking. But I think this film stands up to Hitchcock's test of 'pure cinema' - leave the sound off and you still have a magnificently shot and masterfully executed narrative that anybody can follow. The Blu-Ray format lends itself well to showcasing the stark Stockholm nights, the barren landscapes and the unsettling, asymmetrical framing. Falling snow and spilled blood are as lovingly shot as the translucent skin of the extraordinarily beautiful boy playing Oskar, Kare Hedebrant. The nascent relationship - which, fascinatingly, goes waaaay beyond 'first love' - is intriguingly and tenderly handled. And, for those of us who want only the subtlest touch of violence in our horror films, Alfredson gives us several pivotal scenes that are nice and gruesome, but not sloppily overwhelming. I loved the careful way that the motivating elements of the story essentially bookend the film, so that the viewer can either ignore them - if the 'vampire-y' aspects are found more interesting - or embrace them.

3704010,5,B001MYIXAW,"It says a lot about a genre when one of the best movies of its kind doesn't feel at all like its predecessors in the field.
Let The Right One In is a superbly-crafted vampire/romance movie. It is both emotionally stirring and hauntingly beautiful in ways that few directors in any genre can emulate or even reach. In addition to those accolades, it is also genuinely terrifying at key points in the film.
The story centers around the outsider life of a young boy named Oskar. The audience watches him eke out a tough existence through the typical ordeals of a ""weird"" kid in school (bullies beating him up, girls laughing at him, etc.) in the white, barren wasteland that is apparently Sweden.
Oskar's life changes dramatically, though, when a young girl named Eli drifts into his backyard. She, too, has an ""outsider"" point of view in life that meshes well with Oskar's, for namely more significant reasons that just being different (probably her razor-sharp fangs and love for human blood, ho-hum).
All said, the two strike a relation, and the movie portrays a romance that is heart-breakingly earnest in its execution and epic in scope. As mentioned, it is a fantastic piece of cinematic work. Will it disturb a casual viewer in regards to violence, kids, or implied sexual innuendo? Undoubtedly, but many good movies always push the envelope of what is socially accepted or comfortably watched.

As others have said, Magnolia has announced that the next pressing of this film (if there is one) will contain the theatrical subtitles. Don't buy this unless you truly believe that that will never happen. Personally, I am not confident that they will re-release it unless this version sells an extraordinary number of copies in North America, which it won't because it is a foreign film with very bad subtitles. I love the movie itself and will definitely buy a copy of the new version if/when Magnolia releases it. If after a year or two, Magnolia still has not released a new version, I may consider buying a copy and remuxing the theatrical subtitles in myself. The theatrical subtitles are available online. Although they are a bit hard to find. If you can get your hands on them, and are planning to watch on your computer, there are many players which will allow you to display the subtitles along with the movie. There is also a version of the movie itself with the theatrical subs already muxed in available on thepiratebay if you have a fast enough connection to download a 8 GB file.

Their relationship grows stronger to the point where the girl tells the boy that she is a vampire.

Unlike the Lost Boys, the girl's life is not all fun and games but rather a violent, bloody struggle to survive and stay hidden. The main question in the movie, what makes it really interesting, is the girl vampire actually friends with the boy or is a means to an end?

3704014,5,B001MYIXAW,"I just finished watching  a new horror film from Sweden.  ""Let the Right One In"" is a touching, beautiful film, even though it is a vampire story.

I've never really warmed to vampire tales.  I usually prefer stories of hauntings and witches.  I'm one of the few who liked ""The Blair Witch Project.""

This new film actually reminds me of feelings I had as a child.  The mysterious friend who no one else could see, and who was only occasionally around.  The first bloomings of friendship and love.  The imaginary friend who could do anything.  The keeping of secrets.

This is a film which resonates with those who had a rough time growing up.  It identifies with those who have a longing for intimacy.  It appeals to all who want to be an insider to someone special.

The vampire is unlike any you will have seen.  She is young, lonely, and sad.  Or is she?  She is vulnerable, and yet powerful.  She claims not to be a girl, and yet she is clearly not a boy.  She is just different, and that is what appeals to Oskar, the troubled boy through whose eyes we see Eli and the cruel world of his childhood.

This story shares more in common with after school specials of the 1970's than it does with the modern horror genre.  There is only the necessary amount of blood, and only the required bit of violence and terror.  The film is understated, and this is what gives it its power.

We are so accustomed to seeing monsters cavort around the screen, and to elaborate scenes of predators playing with their prey.  We too often see a hideous monster which becomes overused and dull.  ""Let the Right One In"" is instead a minimalist horror.  A wonderful story, which happens to involve a vampire.

3704019,3,B001MYIXAW,"If you are a fan of vampire movies and would like a more unique take on the genre, I would recommend you check out ""Lt den rtte komma in"" Let The Right One In.

The story takes place in the apartment building of one Oskar (Kre Hedebrant), a quiet 12 year old who is constantly bullied by Conny (Patrik Rydmark) and his two friends, Martin (Mikael Erhardsson) and Andreas (Johan Smnes). One day whilst playing by himself (as usual), Oskar is approached by Eli (Lina Leandersson), a mysterious girl about his age who had just moved in to the apartment next to his. The two soon form a relationship of friendship and a bit more which ultimately leads to Oskar learning that she is a vampire.

The pacing of this movie is a bit slow and will turn-off the newbie horror fans who are used to gore over story. Eli has fangs which are never seen, so the cliche Vampire shots are left out - a choice I view as an excellent one since the fangs would have changed our outlook on her quite a bit. Eli is shown to be somewhat of an innocent, a child who has lived through the ages drinking blood and although she has a killer's instinct to feed, she comes off as lonely and sad the entire time.

Let The Right One In is a love story with the main characters being children. Innocence is exploited, revealed and at times thrown out the door. The cinematography was the highlight of this film for me as we watch the drifting snow fall upon the brick prison of an apartment complex during the initial scene when the kids meet.

I am listening to the English language 5.1 audio and just discovered they're reading the original ""good"" theatrical subtitles. They make many scenes much more sensible.

If you want to experience complete frustration, play the English 5.1 audio with the English subtitles on. You will understand why there is so much anger. The bad subtitles really do change and/or ruin some scenes.

Unfortunately, some of the English language voice work does not do the script justice, so listening to the Swedish and reading the original subs would be ideal. But you can't!!!

What a shame! This is the sweetest yet most haunting film I've seen in years. I don't want to admit how many times I've watched it the past eight days.

But... this is a very quiet, slow movie. If you expect a lot of screaming and bloody fangs, you're in the wrong place.

This is basically a love story... with moments of real horror and dread. Plus some understated but eerie special effects. They're not flashy, just effective. This movie makes you believe there might actually be vampires lurking about.

Speaking of love: that's what I feel for this.

Love the movie; hate the subtitles debacle. Again: If you want to hear the theatrical subtitles being read, listen to the English language 5.1 audio. (I am using the 5.1 English audio. I can't vouch for 2.0. They may have botched that.)

I'm hoping this situation won't lead to a Catch-22: They'll release DVDs with the original subtitles AFTER the pressing with the ""bad"" subtitles is sold out. But  few people want the bad subtitles! Are we going to be stuck with the incomprehensible English subs? Stay tuned horror/romance fans...

Oh... make sure you watch until the closing credits start or you may miss an important last scene.

Enjoy. This is a real gem. I wonder if this is the type of movie that inspires people to make movies?

I love the understatement of this movie. No screaming and running around. A gentle, sympathetic vampire movie? That's what this is.

I can't stop thinking this is the type of movie that inspires others to make movies but I'm afraid the American remake will be much louder and bloodier.

Is this a minor masterpiece? Even the very effective special effects are subtle but eerie. They don't have to pound you over the head, Hollywood!

How can they improve on the girl walking barefoot in the snow or her stomach growling (slightly) when she smells blood? The silent but unsettling way she climbs trees and buildings?

I'm afraid Hollywood will have her snarl, growl, and moan loudly when the boy slits his palm.

Hopefully, they'll prove me wrong but don't bet the rent on it.

3704032,3,B001MYIXAW,"It would seem this ""one"" has managed to captivate quite a few moviegoers & has enthralled it's audiences which simply amazes me. Perhaps baffled is the word I'm looking for. Actually, I was quite stoked about the idea of a really cool vampire flick which seemed to do so well with both audiences/critics alike & was even hoping to catch it on the big scream last year. Boy, I was in for quite a shock. What a snoozer! It took me three consecutive attempts to watch it all the way through.

Don't get me wrong. The film is certainly ok as far as artsy films or just average Horror films go but we've all seen much better in days gone by. As far as vampire movies are concerned, this may be one of the better recent ones but what do we really have to compare it to? Surely not Twilight which for some reason unbeknownst to me I actually find more entertaining. Eek.

Perhaps LTROI just doesn't cover enough new territory or seems rather ridiculous when it re-visits old themes recycled from thousands of other films. We've all seen at least one teenage angst movie in our times where the kid is bullied to a breaking point & must eventually retaliate or suffer horrendously. This theme is well worn out & sadly doesn't help carry the story through in my opinion.

The cinematography? What was teh big deal here? The scenes mostly take place at night so what are we supposed to be looking for? When Oskar meets his young friend, he can only meet her at nite outside their apartment building in the snow. Sorry but I fail to see anything amazing about snow covered grounds filmed during ungodly hours. Winter films can be extremely attractive of course but only in fleeting moments do we get a look at something besides gutteral darkness or pitch black skies with snow-filled playgrounds.

Love themes have a tendency to warm hearts or make people long for something they rarely experience outside of the local multiplex so I thought surely this would be helpful but I'm not very touched by this fruitless attempt either. Much of the dialogue seems awkward for the most part & even a bit forced. As much as I really hate to admit this but Twilight might actually have the upper hand on building more tension or jerking unexpected emotions from it's viewers.

Try as I might, I can find very little here to get excited about nor anything much to delight the eyes in the annal of fantastic cinema. This is pathetic excuse when an arthouse or foreign film can't even begin to rank with a bubble gum teeny bopper film.

The special effects? Ehh. Don't get me started. I don't get it. Much of it looks like something out of an average eighties film & even reminds me of rank Stephen King material although I prefer King to this drab effort any day of the week. There are a couple of semi-clever moments here such as the recently changed woman who is attacked by a mob of cats in hilarious montage. Aside from that, the majority of the murders aren't too spectacular nor could the film be construed as very gruesome.

Overall opinion? Skip purchasing this one & hold out for something else. Rent it if you must. I wasted $15 thinking this would be the highlight of the year but am highly disappointed. I did, however, purchase another DVD around that time which is quite superior to most you will find this year entitled Otto; Or Up With Dead People.",1240876800,2,3340,4.5198675496688745
3704033,5,B001MYIXAW,"I heard a lot about this movie from a guy at work who really liked it, so I decided to pick it up on Blu Ray.

I'm really happy I did!

To start if your looking for a movie with over the top gore, non-stop action, or pretty boy big hair vampires...your in the wrong spot.

I'm a huge fan of foreign films, and this one reminded me of why that is.  The movie starts off in a pure white setting, snow falling in what looks like an extremely cold town, from the light gray buildings, to the pale people of the town...it just feels cold!  The movie is actually pretty quiet throughout, but it really adds to the tension and feel of the surroundings.

I don't like giving away story details in reviews so I wont, but just know this movie feels very real, mainly because of the school setting and home/family life.

The blu ray is excellent, the scenes of snow cover forests and lakes really pop in 1080p!  And the sound is actually quite good also, a few parts are very tense and loud as the tension of the story unfolds.

My favorite part about this movie is how the love story part is between younger people, it helps avoid all the real mushy stuff, Oskar and Eli really get along well and act very well also.  Its actually cute at times just seeing the two interact and try to deal with the issues each one is faced with.

I highly recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys horror, drama, love stories, or a perfect mix of all three!  One last note to anybody that hasn't had the chance to check this movie out...Make sure you change your audio setting to Swedish 5.1, and subtitles on, since the English dubbing is really off sounding and in my opinion distracts from the movies impressiveness!",1240876800,4,1695,4.329113924050633

To be honest, I could've followed the film without dialog, but this DVD is a travesty.  I agree with everyone else.  I enjoyed Insomnia (on VHS only) and the American remake was laughable.

The reviews for this thing have been way too generous and it really built up my hopes.  Its not a masterpiece but it is a pretty good Vampire film.

This is the REAL thing. This is a little Swedish film that is years ahead anything made in Hollywood these days within the Vampire genre.

Little Oskar lives in a small Swedish town. It's Winter and he is bullied at school. Until he meets Eli, a girl who befriends him and teaches him to make a stand against his enemies. In the meanwhile, they both experiment with love. Oh, and by the way, she is a vampire.

This little film captures childhood or pre-puberty as few others do. And on top of that, the horror is so tasteful and well introduced that the viewer is constantly on the edge of his seat without the need for the cheap scares we see in Hollywood these days.

It is amazing how this film captures a kind of Winter mood, as everything seems to stop and be confined to the indoors (while Oskar constantly keeps going to the playground in order to meet Eli). I also loved the cinematography.

But it is the directing, the screenplay and the actors who shine in this film. I did not need the subtitles and it a shame if they do not translate the dialogs accurately, because everything here is beautifully written.

3704049,5,B001MYIXAW,The most original take on the vampire genre that I've seen in a long long while.  I really appreciate the subtlety in the way they convey information to the viewer.  I'm tired of movies that hit you over the head trying to get a point across.  Also had just the right amount of gore (actually fairly minimal).  The director clearly understood that not seeing violence is often more powerful.,1239753600,,391,4.6231884057971016
3704050,4,B001MYIXAW,"""Let the Right One In"" is another film I missed during its theatrical run. The Swedish horror film was released in the frenzy around ""Twilight"", trying to capitalize on the similar themes, but I suspect it got lost. That's a shame because ""Right One"" is a better film than ""Twilight"" and one of the better horror films I have seen in many years.

I don't go to a lot of 'horror' films anymore because too many (most) are simply excuses to try and gross the audience out. Very few try to create any real horror, any real suspense. The days of ""Psycho"", ""The Haunting"" and ""Halloween"" (the original directed by John Carpenter) are long gone. The best horror films create a mood and place and leave a lot of the horror to your imagination, letting us fill in the gory details. This is much better because our minds know what makes us shiver better than watching images trying to frighten us with blood and guts. Grossed out is not the same as scared.

""Let The Right One In"" tells the story of a 12-year-old girl, Eli (Lina Leandersonn) and her grandfather who move into a new apartment in a bleak complex in the dead of winter. They don't come out often and the gossips start to cackle. Oskar (Karl Hederbrandt), a little boy with few friends who has to deal with constant bullying at school, lives in the next building over. One night, he sits in the middle of their snow-covered courtyard and they meet. Oskar and Eli, both outcasts, become friends. As their friendship grows, Oskar begins to suspect his new friend may be a vampire, but seems to be more intrigued by that, rather than frightened. Eli's guardian, caretaker, lover? goes out and tries to find fresh blood for her. But he is getting older and starts to make mistakes. After he is no longer able to supply for her, she ventures out on her own, afraid of what she has to do, out of practice. But Oskar has problems of his own and seems to become more and more empowered by his friendship with the strange girl.

""Let the Right One In"" has moments of blood, moments of violence, but these seem designed to punctuate the story, focus our attention, to remind us of the gravity of the situation. A lot of the more horrific moments in the story are hinted at, or occur off-screen, allowing our imagination to fill in the blanks. This is exactly how a horror film should be and what made this little film so memorable.

Director Tomas Alfredson weaves the story back and forth between the two children, showing us how their lives are different and, in many ways, similar. Then, when they meet, he adds a third element and gives us moments of their lives together, showing us how each is changing the other. It is a very nice portrait of these two very different kids and how they cope with their individual problems.

Apparently, others feel the same way, Hollywood has already purchased the rights to make an American version. I hope they won't, but know they will, make this new version as gory and bloody as most other Hollywood offerings.

Catch ""Let The Right One In"". It is surprisingly good, surprisingly subtle and surprisingly wonderful.

It also has one of the most memorable climaxes I have seen in a film in some time. It made me think of what Hitchcock might have done if he were directing the same film.",1239753600,2,3275,4.531302876480542
3704051,4,B001MYIXAW,"I've heard excellent reviews from this film and as a vampire movie fan I was eager to see it in the theater but being a foreign limited released film I never got the chance. When it was released on DVD hardly any stores here carried the movie and if it did, sold out as they only have a limited amount.
The nice thing about Amazon is that they carry just about all releases and so I bought it from them and it took about 3 days.
Now to the movie:
I loved this movie because it does stick to vampire lore. The title refers to the old rule of vampires being prohibited from entering a home without being invited first. That is just one of the many rules that I remember from reading the old vampire stories. Now you see vampire movies that break the tradition of avoiding sunlight, entering a home without being invited first, etc.
Film quality is decent and there is very little special effects so if more of that is what your looking for, then this may not be your movie.
But if you like the stories in movies you might want to give this a try. This has a new yet traditional spin on vampires and the ending will leave you wondering. A very good movie!",1239753600,,1152,4.217194570135747
3704052,5,B001MYIXAW,"I viewed the Magnolia Home Entertainment DVD publication also and never saw it in the Theaters.  But I loved this ""sleeper"" of a movie.

If you want lots of CGI stuff where there's less acting and more special effects, then this movie is not for you.  But if you prefer drama where the story-telling & the actors draw you in, then this is your movie.  That is why I gave this Swedish ghost/vampire movie a five-star rating.  As cold as this movie was set-in, the actors who played Oskar and Eli really warmed my heart.  The director said it took a year to find these actors - glad he didn't lower his standards and chose to wait until he got the right actors.

Too bad MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT that put out the DVD didn't have these high standards.

What confused me was when I hit PLAY to watch the movie, the Swedish actors were speaking in unnatural sounding English and I could tell it was dubbed because the lips did not move in-synch w/what I was hearing!  (Which is why I prefer to hear the actor's own voice and read subtitles at the bottom)

Glad I went back to the SET UP menu to select the ""subtitled"" version.

But I see from the other reviewers that these subtitles were NOT what was shown in the theaters.
If that is true, then how disappointing.  And even more disappointing that a stingy and unworthy production company - MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT did not consider this gem of a movie deserving of the exra cost of the original subtitles.

Even more insulting is that they did not consider us DVD watchers worthy of what the theater goers got.

3704053,4,B001MYIXAW,"I'd absolutely recommend this film to you. It's nicely done and very emotional actually. The interesting parts are those kids acting great and Sweden in wintertime as a playground. The blueray version has an impeccable quality. I really liked
the eerie and somewhat dull atmosphere created in this story. Quite different a vampire tale.",1239753600,,336,5.2407407407407405
3704054,4,B001MYIXAW,"First, I'll address the poor subtitles. Yes, the matching of the subtitles and english language are so far from accurate that I just turned them off and watched it with the english language track only.
I bought this based off the review on the front of the DVD and I guess it's pretty right. It IS ""A vampire tale like no other. Mesmerizing"". This can be good OR bad. I don't feel it was a bad movie other than the fact that many things characters did in the movie were definately NOT what anyone would do in a real life situation. It was like they made the movie and never went back to proof/edit it for continuity.
Having said that, overall it was a good movie. It WAS original. It was dark, sad and makes you really feel for the characters. You really feel bad because of what Oskar is going through and the way they never quite let you see Eli doing the horrible things she must do. I feel that because they didn't try to CG her being ""superhuman"" that it left room for the viewer to use their imagination a bit.
Some people are jumping on the kiddie porn issue. If I remember right, even though I felt that seeing the one part of Eli's (12 yrs old) body was not neccessary, I think the camera cuts from the body part to the girls face so fast that it most likely wasn't actually her. It was an uneccessary scene that could have been done differently to get the same effect and make everyone happy. Even if it was faked, it was not worth the hassle it is causing and should not have been shown.
On a good note, scenes such as their first meeting (dialogue), the final pool scene, and especially the scene where she tells Oskar, ""You must invite me in."" and what happens to her when she comes in anyway, were really spellbinding. I won't say what happens but you will have to watch to find out.
I will still tell people to see it. It reminds me of Daywatch and 30 days of night...with kids but no major special effects. The effects they did do, were really well done.",1239580800,,1970,4.256

In fact, my biggest advice would be to know as little about the story as possible before you watch it.  So, I'm not going to ruin anything by discussing the plot.  Suffice it to say that its an amazing story, fantastic actors (better than most three times their age), great themes, great hidden under themes, great cinematography, great movie.

3704058,5,B001MYIXAW,"I will not join the subtitle controversy, so I am not reviewing the DVD here, but rather the film, and as a film it is superb.  The words that come to mind are: evocative, stark, meditative, intelligent, deliberate, chill and haunting.

It is the heart of Swedish winter, those days of long nights, spare sunlight, a stark and barren landscape of winter sky and drifted snow, deep black and white, and a slim and delicate 12 year old boy living with his divorced mother, bullied at school, isolated and lonely meets a new neighbor, a strange girl near his age and in turn equally isolated and alienated from her surroundings.  A timid contact is made and a growing connection is made between the two kindred spirits, while eerie and bloody mayhem ensues.

Yes, it's a vampire film, but what is again demonstrated here is that when intelligence is brought to any genre you have something else quite unexpected and special.  The themes of loneliness, isolation and the heart and meaning of ""strangeness"" and the understanding of the ""other"" are subtext to a thriller that has some graphic and disturbing violence and gore, but done by film-makers with the sense to know that what you don't show can be just as effective or even more so than what you do show.

There has been good reason for the buzz around this film, coming out around the same time as bigger budgeted and hyped film and TV shows in the same genre.  This film demonstrates how atmosphere can be made by the accumulation of detail, carefully unfolding.  They don't play with the audience in that they get to the bloody business early on, but it is revealed with deliberate care.  It may sound incongruous to say, but the graphic gore is handled with tact.  It is the glimpsed horror you see and the further horror imagined.  It is the artful use of camera angle, and consideration of a building of tension and violence.  It isn't all about special effects, it is about using them to the greatest effect by not shoving them in the audience face all the time.

That and a mood of overall stillness.  There is something truly eerie about a brutal killing in the quiet of blanketed snow or in the middle of a sleek & blandly modern town square in dead winter night.  They captured it here and it is memorable.

The two young leads are well cast, the girl especially has a wonderful look that is both normal and otherworldly, especially here large, hypnotic eyes.  The rest is a marvelous evocation from an intelligent script and first rate production and direction.  Well done all around, nearly classic.",1239494400,2,2564,4.66

LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is a film of two genres, and it stretches both of them; neither the vampire film nor the pain-of-adolescence film will ever be the same again.",1239494400,2,584,5.223404255319149

This is an AMAZING, entertaining film, and well worth owning, despite ravings to the contrary.
I did not know about this controversy when I watched the Blu-ray last night, and while it was obvious to me that some lines were untranslated, this in no way impeded my enjoyment of the movie.

If someone rinky dink outfit releases a poorly prepared DVD of ""Citizen Kane,"" and customers object by giving it an average ranking of one star, what does the young movie fan, who has never seen ""Citizen Kane,"" make of that one-star rating? He or she decides the movie stinks.

3704065,5,B001MYIXAW,"Right up front, let me make clear that I'm only reviewing the FILM here -- as screened in THEATERS -- and NOT this specific DVD release:

Simply put, 'Let The Right One In' is a hauntingly beautiful gem -- a quiet little masterpiece -- and probably the best sound-era vampire film, in ANY language, EVER.

There have been, obviously, a staggering number of vampire-themed films in the history of cinema. And I added the term ""sound-era"" because of my equal admiration for both Murnau's 'Nosferatu' and Dryer's 'Vampyre'. But, since those early dark wonders, I'd be hard pressed to think of another film on the general theme of vampires which has the emotional depth or startling impact of this small-scale Swedish marvel.

And marvel I did at how sensitively and subtly and uniquely this oft-mined genre was handled in this very special case.

'Let The Right One In' is, decidedly, NOT your daddy's vampire flick. For this unique take on the genre is also as much a love story and coming-of-age drama as it is a vampire movie. Perhaps MORE so, as there is really less emphasis here on the specific details of vampirism -- though they are NOT shied away from either, as is shockingly evident in several memorably chilling sequences.

But it's really the brilliance of the direction, cinematography, writing, and, perhaps most of all, the superb performances of its two young leads which sets this movie apart, in terms of overall quality, from the majority of other films dealing with this theme.

Yet, perhaps the word ""theme"" is misleading in this instance. For if I had to pinpoint the true central theme of this refreshingly non-traditional vampire film, I'd have to say it was loneliness rather than blood sucking.

And it is precisely that thematic core, and how it is conveyed cinematically, which, more than anything else, gives this film its peculiar resonance and a securely high place in the history of sanguinary cinema.",1239235200,2,1931,4.886850152905199

What a let down!  All the hype had me anticipating something fresh, new, and original.  NOT.

This is a typical vampire story about a young girl who needs a human (kind of like the relationship between Dracula and Renfield).  Her adult human helper is so stupid and inadequate that one wonders if this was supposed to be a comedy.

Alas, it is supposed to be a serious movie.

When her adult human helper dies (no surprise here), the little girl befriends the boy next door (literally).

Nothing new here.  Everything is predictible.  Sometimes the badness of the movie made me wince.

Now on to the English dubbing.  It is badly read and very wooden.  So I changed to the original language using English subtitles.  Much better.

Still, no subtitles can save this movie.

If you are such a vampire buff that you want every single vampire movie ever made, buy Let the Right One In.

3704072,5,B001MYIXAW,"Let The Right One"" in is by far the most original Vampire movie I've seen. It will unfortunately get unjustified comparisons to ""Twilight"" seeing the closeness of the plots and release dates. The story follows the puny and shy Oscar who constantly gets beat on by his classmates. By beat on, I mean quite harshly, one altercation results in Oscar nearly going deaf in one ear. His world is a lonely and terrifying one until he notices he has a new neighbor who is a little odd seeing that they keep the windows covered during the day. One fateful night Oscar meets the young girl next door who ""Smells funny"" and a bizarre yet endearing friendship ensues. Eli is a vampire who ""has been 12 a very long time"" and she acts as Oscar's guardian and adviser as he learns to stand up for himself against the brutalities of childhood. While doing so Eli leans that she can still have human compassion while no longer being human herself. ""Let The Right One In"" is a jewel of a film in a genre that has produced some awful films. It's haunting, at times terrifying and strangely touching. One of the best movies of the year.",1238976000,,1116,4.4754901960784315

He is bullied at school, and Oskar imagines what it would be like to frighten his torturer as he has been frightened.  Then he meets Eli, an apparently odd but pretty young woman who moves next door, who turns out to be something altogether different.  The relationship that develops is both extremely touching and utterly disturbing.  The film touches upon themes that are at the heart of the Showtime series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dexter/dp/B000Q6GUW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dexter</a>, but with a tenderness that reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life-as-a-Dog/dp/B000087EY5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life as a Dog</a>.

This astonishing film deserves to be seen widely, far beyond the ""cult film"" and even ""arthouse"" audiences that have been wowed by it in theaters.  Here's hoping that with a newly subtitled version on dvd and Blu-ray (it is unclear whether the announced update is what you'll get when you buy it through Amazon), this film will find the mainstream audience it deserves.  It is, by far, the most moving scary movie I've ever seen - for its unique combination of innocence and dread, the only precedent I can think of might be the fascinating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Night-of-the-Hunter/dp/B000035P5R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Night of the Hunter</a>.

Highly recommended.",1238976000,,2273,6.496688741721854
3704075,5,B001MYIXAW,"Obviously, there's a huge uproar over the terrible injustice Magnolia did to this film.  Instead of keeping the much superior translation used in the theatre version, they redid it with one that is nowhere near as good.  It's unfortunate.  If that's something you're interested in, then maybe you should skip this film for the time being.  The following review is of the film, leaving the controversy to the side since that's being expertly covered already here at Amazon.com.

Let the Right One in...what a fantastic film.  After watching the film, I didn't quite know what to say.  I think Roger Ebert said it best:

""Remove the vampire elements, and this is the story of two lonely and desperate kids capable of performing dark deeds without apparent emotion. Kids washed up on the shores of despair. The young actors are powerful in draining roles. We care for them more than they care for themselves. Alfredson's palette is so drained of warm colors that even fresh blood is black.""

So, yes.  It's about a vampire.  But it's not really.  On one hand, it's a harsh coming of age story for Oskar, a young boy caught between two separated parents who don't really seem to care for him, a school that seems to ignore him, bullies that want to do not nice things to him and a vampire that wants...well, what does she/it want?  Eli, that would be the vampire, meets Oskar one night after she moved in next door to him.  She appears to be about his age, but there's something decidedly off about her.  She lives with a vaguely creepy older man, who goes out and does unspeakable things at night to feed her.  She, like Oskar, exists in a world that ignores her---unless of course they discover what she is, and then I'm sure the world would be filled with more than just bullies.

She tells Oskar he needs to stand up for himself and he does, which leads him along a messed up journey of self-discovery and growing up.  This isn't a heart-warming story (or is it?).  Its vampires don't sparkle.  Of course, with the washed out, cold colors Alfredson paints the story with, nothing does.  This is further exemplified with this excellent Blu Ray transfer.  The film looks so cold, I expected frost on my TV.  The brilliant color scheme is used very effectively and is only heightened with the pitch perfect transfer.  Definitely recommend this version.

At the center of this movie is, I think, a question.  Does Eli, the girl vampire who says she isn't a girl, really love Oskar?  Or is she manipulating him to be her next caretaker?  Can she even love?  I don't know.  And I'm still uncertain by the movie's end, though I have a good feeling I know.  Regardless, it's a terrific film acted by surprisingly excellent child actors.  And I'd recommend watching it.",1238976000,5,2760,4.650103519668737

HOWEVER, Magnet Releasing has agreed to release the theatrical subtitles once all the current inventory is gone. So I suggest you wait to buy it when it is available or  download it.

3704080,1,B001MYIXAW,"""Let The Right One In"" is without a doubt one the best films of 2008, bar none. Atmospheric, touching, chilling, disturbing, and haunting, it will remain with you for days after your first viewing experience.

That being said I was REALLY anticipating the Blu-ray release. Unfortunately, Magnet/Magnolia Pictures decided to REPLACE the theatrical subtitles with a new translation for home video. The result? A different film altogether. The egregious aspects of this are:

* There is NO indication anywhere on the product packaging that the subtitles on the disc differ from the theatrical subs.
* Magnet/Magnolia has acknowledged the problem in a press release and has stated publicly that future pressings of ""Let The Right One In"" will include the ORIGINAL theatrical subtitles in addition to the subs on the current disc.
* Magnet/Magnolia IS NOT OFFERING ANY KIND OF TRADE-IN OR REPLACEMENT PROGRAM FOR CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASED THE CURRENT ""DEFECTIVE"" DISC!!!! In other words, if you own the ""defective"" release and you want the original theatrical subtitles, you'll have to spend an additional $20-$25 for the ""new"" disc to get them!!

Because this release has been significantly altered from its original theatrical form, AND because Magnet/Magnolia seems to have no respect for it's customers or any concept of what customer service means, I'm giving this release of ""Let The Right One In"" a single star. DON'T BUY IT. Send a message to the studio that treating their customers in this way has financial consequences. Maybe that's something they WILL understand.",1238630400,29,1569,5.243027888446215

The movie stood as an excellent film, dare I see a coming of age piece, and the translation was secondary to the film.

POSSIBLE SPOILER!

That being said, I loved that the movie wasn't soley based on vampirism, but instead was about a young boy learning about love(?) and life. Finding strength in someone else to develop and grow into a stronger person, was what stuck out in my mind. Also, even though there was blood and brutality, the movie had a soft edge to it. I believe the edge came from the scenery (constant snow, and drab apartments), or from the superb acting of the child stars.

This movie really is done so well and is so difficult to describe. Is it a love story? Yes. A horror flick? Yes. But done so dramatically and far-removed from the usual schlock like ""Twilight"" and other cheap knock-offs.

From the title and the preview i had no idea this was a vampire movie it was done so i want to say discretly almost as though the writers didn't want to blow the surprise hahaha.  It took me till well off into the middle of the movie before i relized it was a vampire movie and it was like someone shook me and woke me up like kaduh! hahahah I loved it!  I loved the fact that they used alittle girl and a little boy and showed the movie through their eyes instead of an adults because thats how we see most movies through the eyes of an adult.  I love the whole emtional side to the movie.  That even though the little girl who wasn't even a girl but she cared for this boy Oskar and he cared for her.  They protected and looked out for each other.  Oskar didn't seem to care what she was or what she did his love was uncondiotional and most kids are that way.  I can go on and on about the movie but i won't ill leave some things for other viewers to talk about.

The acting is awesome (especially from the child actors), the mood is tense, and the film's conclusion, despite being non-ambiguous, leaves the audience with a lot to ponder if they choose to do so.

Do not buy the Blu-Ray or DVD released by Magnet.  They intentionally dropped the theatrical subtitles and replaced them with a heavily ""dumbed down"" version that sacrifices the mood of the story.  Magnet claims that they will reissue the DVD and Blu-Ray with the correct subtitles.  You can be certain you have the Theatrical subtitles by looking on the disc information on the back of your DVD and checking to see if it says ""English (Theatrical"" under subtitles.

3704090,5,B001MYIXAW,"Out of Norway comes a fantastic little vampire movie. Centered around a outcast 12 year old, he befriends a 12 year old vampiric girl. Most of the movie is a very close and personal movie about the boy and his struggles with bullies, divorced parents, and having no friends. In between are scenes of the vampire, the building friendship, and ultimate resolution. The story is rather predictable, but it's done so well that you don't mind. It's more suspenseful than horror, but there are a few bloody scenes that keep the pacing. Not often can a vampire horror movie be considered charming. And that's what makes this movie special.

There is a bit of controvesy over the subtitles. Apparently the distributor dumbed down the dialog for the US release. But they are releasing a new version with the original subtitles. Without seeing the new version, I can say that the current subtitles are servicable and don't detract from the movie at all. And stay away from the dubbing.

I understand that the distributor, Magnet, has recently released a statement apparently confirming this issue will be amended on future manufacturing presses but the only way you'll know this is by looking at the details in print on the reverse of the sleeve; as you're probably going to buy this through Amazon, I imagine it's going to therefore be difficult to establish which version you'll ultimately receive?

I've personally re-ordered the DVD from it's native Sweden as I believe that the English subtitles on their own domestic release are the original same as those shown in theatres, so fingers crossed for that.

I'm sure Magnet had their reasons for this but it's an appaling treatment of both film and customer, as they will apparently not even be entertaining the concept of an exchange for those who've already purchased. For shame...",1238284800,11,1218,4.902912621359223
3704092,5,B001MYIXAW,"Opening scene: there he is, on his bed, presenting as pale (nearly nude) sacrifice to Nemesis-- the nasty tormenting teenage boys he must daily encounter  at school.

Why is he (Oskar, well played by young Kare Hedebrant) a victim?  The usual reason in such contexts: he is different from the herd.  He reads--all sorts of esoteric stuff.  He is intelligent.  He is alone. . without allies or companionship or, even, familial support (his parents appear to be indifferent). Thus a natural victim, awaiting destruction.  In addition, his nose runs constantly.  His tormentors call him ""pig.""

Why is this pattern ""olde wine?""  Because while it does not replicate it resonates with many features of Norse and Anglo-Saxon myths of heroes and ""dragons of chaos.""

Set in the cold darkening of a Stockholm winter, Oskar can find no warmth, or strength, either inside or out.  Until the appearance of a girl,
Eli, well played by Lina Leandersson.

She is, or will become, in a sense, his ""white knight,"" his ""salvation,"" his ""right one,""and eventually his raison d'etre. . .and they will, yes, go off into the sunset together.

No, this not another trite teen romance.  For the girl is a vampire.  And no, this is not another vampire romance (""oh I just love your overbite"").

What renders this relation anything but trite, and anything but a blood-sucking addict/victim symbiosis, are ancient warrior values: loyalty, courage, and revenge.  Yes, revenge.

Forget about ""New Testament"" notions of forgiveness; of ""turn the other cheek""; of ""love your enemy"" and so on and so forth.  This story is about tearing to pieces the enemy that would destroy you. About never quitting the field until he, or they, are in bloody pieces.  And about unfailing, unflagging dedication to your comrades--or comrade, in this instance, ""the right one"" you have let into your life.

Thus, the ancient warrior ethic in a modern film of remarkably brilliant conception and execution. No American ""studio"" or production outfit could possibly have made it.  They would have spent tons of money and made lots of noise, gunfire and explosions and grunting and groaning.  This is a film of silences, like a Bergman film, meaningful and reflective of what lies beneath the surface of a life--or in Eli's case, a death.

3704093,4,B001MYIXAW,"Oskar is a lonely, bullied 12-year-old boy, waif-thin, who lives with his single mother in a run-down apartment in 1982 Sweden.

The two kids become fast friends, but little does Oskar know that Eli has been twelve years old for quite some time now...

""Let the Right One In"" is a spectacular horror movie.  It's not your typical Hollywood fair; there's quite a bit of gore, yes, and it's definitely disgusting, but blood is never used gratuitously--it's all to enhance the atmosphere, which is what propels the film forward.  Granted, an emphasis upon atmosphere means a slower plot.  Viewers used to more standard horror movies will become bored; even hardened viewers of atmospheric films might shuffle in their seat on occasion.

The wait is well-worth it, however.  ""Let the Right One In"" isn't scary so much as it is deeply disturbing; it's as much a psychological horror movie, which is usually the best kind of horror.  It seeps under your skin, letting the real horror of this budding friendship sneak up on you, until you suddenly realize: ""Holy crap, he's best friends with a blood-thirsty creature!""  The center of the film is the friendship between the two children, a relationship that is as creepy as it is touching.  It won't be long until Hollywood gets its hands on this film and completely ruins it; thus, I highly recommend you see the movie as it is, and be prepared to spend a few hours afterwards wondering if you should be touched or terrified by this compelling, elegant, intelligent horror film.",1238198400,,1682,4.76551724137931

BUT, this dvd has totally different subtitles. Problem is that the translation is terrible. The worst. Totally Irrelevant to the lines or situations. This ruined the beauty of this movie.

The theatrical translations are dubbed into English voice. What the hell is matter with Magnolia? Why didn't they just put the same translations into subtitles? Magnolia Home Entertainment, You disappointed lots of fans of this movie.",1238025600,43,726,5.1440677966101696

[...]

In other news today, you might recall that we recently reviewed Magnet's Let the Right One In on Blu-ray Disc. Well, it's just come to our attention that the DVD and Blu-ray versions have English subtitles that differ substantially from those of the theatrical art house presentation, in that much of the subtle nuance has been lost and many original lines of dialogue are untranslated entirely. Unfortunately, having only seen the film once in theatres, I wasn't familiar enough with the translation to spot the differences. But Icons of Fright has posted some examples of just how different the subtitles are. We contacted Magnet directly on this issue this afternoon, and they were quick to respond as follows:

""We've been made aware that there are several fans that don't like the version of the subtitles on the DVD/BR. We had an alternate translation that we went with. Obviously a lot of fans thought we should have stuck with the original theatrical version. We are listening to the fans feedback, and going forward we will be manufacturing the discs with the subtitles from the theatrical version.""

We asked Magnet some follow-up questions, specifically how people will be able to identify the new discs, when they'll be available in stores and if there will be an exchange program for those who have the existing version. Here's what they said:

""There are no exchanges. We are going to make an alternate version available however. For those that wish to purchase a version with the theatrical subtitles, it will be called out in the tech specs box at the back/bottom of the package where it will list SUBTITLES: ENGLISH (Theatrical), SPANISH.""

The no exchange thing is going to upset many that have already purchased the disc, and understandably so. We're at least encouraged to see that the title is being corrected. We'll let you know when the discs are available, and rest assured we're letting Magnet know that an exchange program might be a wise idea...",1237852800,5,2206,5.0136612021857925
3704113,3,B001MYIXAW,"The mood and tempo of this film is great - reminded me alot of 'Insomnia', which I loved in both the foreign and American versions. Slowly paced, set in a dark and snowy Sweden.

The film is set in 1982, which is a bit odd, as its obviously not based on a true story nor is there anything in the telling of the story which really requires it, save an appearance by a Rubick's Cube. Maybe the original story was more timely.

The dubbing on the dubbed version is fine for the two main characters, not as great for the supporting characters but its adequate. However, there are two handwritten notes between the main characters in the film which are not translated, which in my opinion is inexcusable, as one seems fairly substantial.

As many will note, this is not a 'scary' horror movie although there are certainly horror scenes, some graphic. Its is more about the relationship between the two main characters - don't let that keep anyone from seeing this film, though, its a gem.",1237852800,,983,4.5423728813559325

If you are going to buy this DVD, either download and use the theatrical subtitles or use the mediocre dubbing track.

3704118,5,B001MYIXAW,"You don't have to be fond of vampire flicks to love this film, just fond of masterful movie-making.  If you can't see this in the theater, get the blu-ray - the cinematography, complimented with the perfect balance of haunting music, poetic dialogue and pitch-perfect performances, is too gorgeous for anything else.

The mood is set early:  dark, tense, beautiful and sad, gripping yet slowly and deliberately paced.  I was entranced within ten minutes and it never let go.  It's a story of two misfit children who stumble upon each other and instantly bond - drawn to each other out of loneliness and dark secrets.  Oskar is an angelic looking 12-year-old boy bullied at school and forgotten by his divorced parents. Eli, a frail, neglected looking girl who appears to be about the same age, moves into the apartment next door.  We soon learn that Eli is neither a girl nor 12 years old - she's a vampire who starts slaughtering the hapless neighbors when she needs a meal.  The outside world is threatening and  troublesome for both of them, and Oskar and Eli develop a tender and endearing friendship under the cover of long, Swedish winter nights and a blanket of snow and ice.  But Eli needs blood and she is chillingly pragmatic about getting it. She is also rather reckless; victims start piling up and terrified townsfolk begin closing in.

If the movie has any flaws, it's because perhaps too much footage was left on the cutting room floor.  There are a few puzzling loose-ends that should not have been left that way, and I am guessing they are explained in the book.  Other than that, it's about as perfect as films get. It's not a feel-good movie and it's not for everyone, but it's mood and vision are mesmerizing and transcendent.  That's the kind of movie I love.",1237766400,2,1780,4.7
3704119,3,B001MYIXAW,"When watching the initial preview for Twilight, the critics skewered it and recommended that everyone watch this film instead. Generally having trust in most critics and being a lover of Independent an Foreign films, I took their advice. I actually did not go see Twilight because of the reviews until my 13 yr. old begged me to take her after a month in theaters. To my surprise I really enjoyed it and went to see it again. Then I rented ""Let the Right One In"" to compare and see if the critics were right. The cover boded chills and a surreal horror for me. But try as I might, I just COULD NOT get into this movie! Admittedly there are a few chilling scenes, like when the young vampire girl comes into her neighbors house ""uninvited"". But the stretches of quiet, but somewhat mundane scenes in between became difficult to endure. Soon I started wondering, ""how long is this movie? Is it almost over?"" Which is never a good sign. And one scene involving vicious attack cats had me laughing out loud. Which is bad since it was the only major reaction I had to the movie. Don't take me for some bourgeois American who only sees what the masses want. I love art house film. But I won't say that I love something just because it IS an art house/foreign film. I rented this movie with high expectations but was rather let down ... and surprised to find out that I was far more entertained by a mainstream movie about teenaged vampires than this slow and lukewarm film about a bloodthirsty prepubescent.

3704121,5,B001MYIXAW,"Let the Right One In is highly original. For some reason I hadn't realized it was based on a book, but I shouldn't be surprised, some of the best movies were first books.

Let the Right One In is a creepy, quiet, and eerie movie and I thought it was pure genius. Though it moved at a slow pace my eyes were pretty much glued to the screen. There was a lot going on, bullying, blood sucking, murder, and loneliness and eventually friendship and love. It just worked.

I think the one thing that bothered me was a lack of a backstory of Eli and also another character from the beginning of the film. It's only hinted at but not much more. I believe that it's expanded greatly in the book according to a bit of research I did.

This movie brings you through a roller coaster of emotions, fear and sadness but also love. I really liked it and am disappointed to hear that Hollywood is already working on their own version as we speak. So much for letting this movie bask in the limelight. I would highly suggest this movie, and for people that scare easy like me, I would call it more creepy than scary.

3704123,4,B001MYIXAW,"What do you get when you cross a vampire story with a tender tale of impossible love?  If you answered ""Twilight,"" then you haven't seen ""Let the Right One In,"" a Swedish horror movie with an art-house sheen.

Oskar (the excellent Kare Hedebrant) is the twelve-year-old schoolboy who's the perpetual target of a trio of bullies; Eli (the equally fine Lina Leandersson) is the fetching young vampire who moves into the apartment next door.  Together, these two social outcasts form a powerful emotional bond, with Eli hiding the truth about herself from Oskar till the point where she no longer can.

Written by John Ajvide Lindqvist (who adapted his own novel) and directed by Tomas Alfredson, ""Let the Right One In"" is less concerned with the blood-and-guts aspects of the scenario than with the pain and remorse each of the main characters experiences throughout the course of the drama.  Though obviously craving a ""normal"" life, Eli is hopelessly trapped by her own nature, forced to endure a life of loneliness and killing simply to survive in the world.  Oskar is equally alone, though for more prosaic reasons.  In addition to the constant bullying, Oskar is a product of a broken home, and like Eli, he too may finally have to resort to violence to ensure his existence.  Then there's Eli's father who numbly and methodically performs the gruesome bloodletting rituals he knows he must if his daughter is to survive.

There's a genuine poignancy in the fact that Eli knows that she can never give herself fully to Oskar for fear of consigning him to the same murderous fate she herself must endure.  A similar sense of twisted pathos pervades Eli's relationship with her father, who carries paternalistic duty to a whole new, genuinely disturbing level.

All of this is played out against stark, sparsely-furnished, minimalist settings that provide an appropriately atmospheric backdrop for the story being told.

As ""art"" horror films go, this one is not quite as bone-chilling or as memorable as the truly diabolical ""Funny Games,"" but it still provides a welcome respite from all those inane, studio-manufactured products we're forced to endure on a regular basis when Hollywood sets its sights on terror.",1237680000,,2216,5.008174386920981

3704125,5,B001MYIXAW,"Kudos! This has to be one of the most charming, original, unique and unusual vampire films I have ever seen. Based on the Swedish bestselling novel by John Lindqvist, this remarkable fairy tale-like story takes place in a suburb of Stockholm, Sweden during the early but drab 1980's when Sweden was still heavily influenced by the Soviet bloc. This drab, bleak, wintry landscape becomes the background for a terrific suspense horror story involving two 12 year old Swedish children as they explore and discover their existential lives, confront their own demons both literally and figuratively, and their relationship with each other amidst their own pre adolescent growing pangs. It's a novel coming of age love story in a macabre sort of way as 2 children form a most unlikely alliance in their mutual affection and self-preservation against a hostile social environment.
Oskar is the brunt of cruel and mean school bullies who use almost every opportunity possible to persecute him while Lia, a new neighbor, has a vampire nature and requires a fresh homo-sapien food supply that pits her against civil Swedish society in order for her to maintain her physical life and existence. Everything works together in this film to create a haunting and mysterious backdrop to this fairy tale of 2 children dealing with finding their place in the world and ultimately in each other's hearts.
From an artistic point of view, the directing, cinematography, acting, soundtrack are superb. The supernatural ambiance is magically interlaced with the mundane and the macabre. The child actors playing the 2 main characters of Oskar and Lia are natural and gifted in their abilities to pull off the complex roles  they perform with such sophisticated grace and nuance. They are entirely believable and unforgettable ! Brilliant acting debut performances by these 2 young children, ages 11 and 12 at the time of filming. Regrettably, Magnolia film distributor, chose to go with amateur, crude subtitles that do not capture the essence or nuance of the actual dialogue as seen at the theater. English dubbing is decent however, and helps even when watching this film in subtitles to preserve the original dialogue. Eventually we will see this movie re released with the original theatrical subtitles. For now I would not let these inferior subtitles deter anyone from enjoying this fine film especially if dubbing and subtitles are employed together and simultaneously.
Although this is a superb horror film, it lacks the gratuitous blood and gore of many Hollywood horror movies and does not need to rely on alot of special effects to distract one from the real story. Although this vampire character deviates from the classic Hollywood stereotype in a number of ways, the result is a more contemporary and compelling and heroic vampire figure and story. Seldom if ever, have I ever felt empathy for a vampire in an authentic sort of way. Lia, although a little demon, is at once both lovable and innocent. One may find a few scenes somewhat disturbing, but overall 'Let the Right One In' is a creatively made artsy vampire film that aspires to something beyond itself. It is hard not to compare this film to an Ingmar Bergman masterpiece in its existential authenticity. Although it is technically a vampire movie as well, this prepubescent child vampire is crisp, refreshing and original breaking the Hollywood stereotypes and molds. Unlike a mediocre vampire flick like Twilight, this vampire tale is unpretentious and non-manipulated and the vampire protagonist in this story has autheniticity, depth, innocence, complexity without the libido and erotic undertones found in so many familiar worn-out vampire tales. Neither can she be categorized as a classic ""villain"" in spite of her carnivorous appetite and taste to feed on homo-sapiens. She manages to retain a precarious innocence even as an demon avenger.
Be sure to watch this Swedish cinematic gem before the Hollywood remake is released in 2010. This story has an uniquely Swedish flavor and ambiance that is sure to be lost as Hollywood diligently dumbs down this amazing movie to placate an American audience complete with hyperactive special effects and computer graphics. Any Hollywood remake is bound to lack the originality, authenticity and creativity of this independent foreign movie full of nuance and Swedish atmospheric effects.
One of the themes of this film is 'revenge and love' and along with Luc Besson's Angel-A, it has to be one of my favorites along this line. This is a movie you may potentially desire to watch over and over again as it has a depth and artistic creativity  seldom seen in generic vampire movies. This film is destined to capture the hearts of many and become an international cult classic. Rated by several movie critics as one of the best films produced in 2008.",1237680000,,4851,5.092964824120603
3704126,5,B001MYIXAW,"I can't stress enough how much of a foreign film this is. American films and therefore American audiences generally expect something with more bang for their buck. Bigger, flashier, faster is normally what we get. And there are films that that philosophy serve well. But films from other countries, especially countries that tend to be a little colder temperature-wise, are much more deliberately paced. The movement in a film like LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is a little more staccato, like someone moving through snow and ice. Some steps are very slow and methodical, and the next steps may require faster movement in order to stay upright.

This is not to say that LET THE RIGHT ONE IN moves in an uneven rhythm; quite the opposite. It's a film that keeps its pace and its tone very consistent. To call this film a ""horror"" film is akin to calling WALL-E an ""animated"" film. It's pigeon-holing it and doing it a serious injustice. With all the hyperbole on the case for the DVD for this film, people are going to more than likely be expecting something that moves quickly and has lots of gore and sexuality, as most vampire films do. But that is just not happening in this film.

A lot has been said about the story of this film, and I don't have anything to add to that, but as far as my thoughts about this film are concerned, with a few exceptions, I just couldn't recommend a film from 2008 as highly. The two young leads have a chemistry together that puts most adult screen couples to shame. There is never a moment that seems forced, false or out of place. The dialogue, direction, and cinematography are all some of the finest that you'll see in a film all year. It's an extrememly moody film, that has moments of raw emotional brutality and shocking violence, because when it happens, you don't expect it, and that's exactly what makes a film like this work so incredibly well. Violence never should be telegraphed with a film of this kind. It should come as a bolt out of the blue that leaves your jaw hitting the ground, and that's exactly what LET THE RIGHT ONE IN does.

And there are moments in the film that you'll never forget.

Many fans of the vampire horror genre have been waiting for the definitive vampire film, and this may not have the epic sweep of something like Neil Jordan's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE or the hyperkinetic bloodletting of one of the BLADE films or the nostalgia of the DRACULA films, but this is definitely the best ""vampire"" film that I've ever seen, and ranks amongst the best of 2008.",1237593600,,2527,4.547252747252747

3704129,5,B001MYIXAW,"I wasn't sure about this movie; I remember the reviews when it first came out and they were a little mixed.  I can see why because it's not your usual kind of vampire movie.  One thing I will caution about: it's very slooooow.  That kind of bothered me but I went with it. Foreign films often have a different kind of pacing from American ones.

That said: I really enjoyed the movie in spite of the slowness.  It stayed with me for a long time after I watched it.  I went back and watched some scenes again after I read up on it here and on IMDB.  I did not find it predictable and that's a good thing in a vampire movie, since the topic has been done to death, so to speak.  I will admit I did not understand one of the key things about Eli until I read some stuff on IMDB.  (I just finished reading the book and it was explained there, but I felt it was unclear in the movie, as were several other plot points.)

The movie is beautiful to look at, very good photography.  I thought the two young actors who played the leads were great.  There was a lot of honest emotion in the movie.  I felt emotionally connected to the characters in a way that I normally don't with this type of film.  One can't help feeling pity for Eli even while being horrified by what she is and does.

I hear an American remake of this movie is on the way, which is probably unfortunate and which I'll probably skip, because it will most likely be loud, overly bloody, and poorly written.  We tend to ruin this type of film.

I don't think this film is over-the-top gory compared to some vampire films but the squeamish might want to avoid it.

Book compared to movie: I think the book explains some things better and there are some subplots that didn't make it into the movie that I enjoyed, but I would rate both about equally.  The film is beautiful and haunting, which the book can't really manage.

Overall, highly recommended, I am planning to buy it because I'd like to see it again.",1237248000,,1969,4.241935483870968

The movie says a lot without being overly gory,unike past films in the genre. Some may be a bit weirded out between one particular scene between Eli and Oscar,but (not giving away any plot points here) there's a logical reason that the relationship is purely platonic.

Sweden is used well as a backdrop for the film(during the time the movie takes place,there is almost always snow on the ground)

The last few minutes of the film are jarring(the scene  at the pool is one to make you go ""Oh. My. God.""). The ending is a bit up in the air(I wouldn't be surprised if there's a sequel in a few years' time).It'll be interesting to see what the American remake is like.",1237248000,3,847,4.48051948051948
3704131,3,B001MYIXAW,"SPOILER ALERT:
First off I watched this with english dubbing, and the actors voices were horrible, so maybe if I had watched it with subtiltes, I may have raised my 3 star rating.
I read many reviews that were 5 star, so maybe I was expecting more from it.
The idea is awesome: what appears to be serial killer murders, a 12 year old vampire girl, a 12 year old mortal boy who is being bullied, and falls for the girl, a snowy backdrop, etc.
BUT, for me some questions:
WHY was the boy beautiful and the girl homely?
WHY was there not a single cop, investigator, etc, on the scene in any of the murders?
(a drained body in the woods,  body frozen in the lake, a woman who burst into flames in a hospital, a man who put acid on his face, and while in the hospital gets pushed out the window and onto the ground several stories below, and 3 or 4 mutilated kids bodies at a wmca)
WHY was there no sense of fear in the town, or the hospital?
WHY was there one scene in the middle of the movie that had NO snow at all, when every other scene had ""2 feet"" according to reports, and another 2 feet on the way?
HOW did the boy get away from the wmca scene at the end with the girl in a box no less?
I still liked the ""feel"" of it.
I am still waiting for that GREAT vampire movie.",1237161600,3,1271,3.984313725490196
3704132,4,B001MYIXAW,"This was a well made and well acted movie.
However, if you are looking for a movie that will scare you, then this is not it.
It is probably 45 percent drama, 45 percent love story and maybe 10 percent horror.
If you like movies like Twilight, then this is good for you.
If you are looking to get scared, then you need to watch something else, as this will not do the trick!",1237075200,,373,4.054054054054054
3704133,2,B001MYIXAW,"From the time I first heard of this movie I was sure I would like it and waited eagerly for it to be available. Let me say that I am quite a fan of European films and like Bergman especially. When I finally watched it a couple of days ago, I was very disappointed.  While I thought the cinematography was quite good, the overall film left me bored and unmoved.  I find myself somewhat puzzled by the raves that appear about it here and other places because I feel that it is being extremely over-hyped.  Perhaps if I had watched it before reading all the raves I would have like it (at least a little) more.

For those who read this and plan to watch it, I would advise you to be sure to set up your DVD player to run the audio in the original Swedish with English subtitles.  I accidentally watched the dubbed version and, I must say it was one of the most horrible examples of dubbing that I have ever witnessed.",1237075200,8,914,4.2
3704134,4,B001MYIXAW,"What an absolutely beautiful coming of age tale.

Let the Right One In offers a splendid contrast of tender emotion and eye-popping violence to the vampire genre.  Fearlessly it tiptoes a provocative line of adolescence and terror while channeling heavy doses of emerging sexuality.  Powerful stuff, this creepy story is bound to suck the marrow from your bones and leave you floating helplessly toward your most devilish nightmare.

It's the story of boy meets girl, a girl who harnesses a deep dark secret.  They form a unique bond as they walk a tumultuous journey of acceptance and self-discovery.

This movie features an excellent build-up of controlled suspense and visceral fear.  The acting by the young stars is phenomenal, plus the music and special effects are top notch.  I think the most impressive part is the camera work, the visual style is just perfect with the off-center closeups, interesting angles, and some unique shots filmed from a distance.  It really gives a feeling of helplessness at crucial times.

There is one particular scene I really hated though.  There's a vicious attack by a group of crazy kitties?!?  These wild furballs start chomping down on a woman who had just recently been bitten by the vampire.  Huh?!?  To me, this incident seemed misplaced, silly, and downright comical.

That's the only real misstep in this otherwise immaculate Swedish horror film.  It has plenty of dynamic moments that will leave quite an impression.  Very artistic and unsettling, 4.5 stars.",1237075200,2,1510,5.09795918367347
3704135,5,B001MYIXAW,"First off, let me say, in my mind Let The Right One In is the best movie of 2008 ... period! That said, the DVD release is NOT the theatrical version!!! Read the other reviews if you would like to know what it's about but I want to make a quick comment on the DVD.

First off, the english dubbing is a joke. Turn it off and go with the subtitles. Thre dubbing takes aways from the story and is almost laughable.

Next, the subtitles are not correct and much is left out!!!! If you watched the trailer you see Oskar ask Eli to be his girlfriend ... a sweet moment between 2 tweleve year old kids ... in this version, the subtitle reads ... 'Do I have a chance with you?"" WHAT????? What 12 year old talks like that??? The subtitles get worse, and much is left out.

I've seen this movie 3 times in the theater, and reviewed for several websites. I'm sad to say, this DVD is not that movie. By changing the subtitles, and actually removing dialogue, the story has lost much of it innocence and taken the viewer on a trip that is confusing at times ... I guess the the producers of this film didn't feel American Viewers could understand the simple beauty of this story and had to sreamlime the dialouge and make it more adult ... Shame on them!!! I'll be loooking for a European release to purchase ...",1237075200,15,1299,4.251012145748988

3704137,5,B001MYIXAW,"I'm always wary of hype, particularly with foreign films as there's always a requisite ""movie snob"" air to some of it, but in this rare case it's totally justified. THE best vampire movie and probably the best movie I've seen in a few years. Actually it is much more than a vampire movie, with equal parts coming-of-age, revenge and love.

Cold, quiet and depressing, yet really touching with many scenes that stick with you. The two lead child actors are just amazing. They're able to convey so much just with expressions and movements that words aren't even necessary. I could watch the ""come in uninvited scene"" alone over and over again. Another fine point is the way some things aren't spelled out directly for us, allowing us to interpret as we see fit, as in the final scene. The filmmakers allow you to end it the way you feel it should.

For the gore-hounds, the grue is here as well, but it's more tasteful than there for sheer shock value (though it's well appreciated in the final scenes, that's for sure!). I'm trying to remember the last time I've seen children killing and being killed on screen in some fairly graphic depictions and it's definitely escaping me. This seems to be a taboo subject in American films, but I glad for the open-mindedness of others as it works in the context this film.

This is a movie that you will constantly be thinking about after seeing it and that is definitely the sign of a memorable piece of work. Everything comes together. Story, cinematography, setting, pace, direction. The whole package. My highest recommendation!

On to the Blu-ray tech specs, I had rented the DVD first (I'm being more careful with blind buys these days) and the BD is a HUGE improvement over it. The BD's picture is razor sharp and seems to be free of DNR. This is a bleak picture due to the location, night scenes and winter setting, but the when colors do come into play they are much more accurate and deeper than the DVD. The blood looks truly realistic in color and texture now, almost disturbingly so, particularly the scene where it's running down Eli's face.

The Swedish DTS-MA 5.1 audio is excellent as well. I definitely recommend avoiding the English dub. This is not a bombastic audio movie, but the dynamic range is excellent. You can almost hear the snowflakes tinkling in the opening and closing scenes and then get knocked out of your seat when a bus drives by on an overpass.

Extras are nice if not substantial. We get four pretty good deleted scenes (I think they were in HD as well), a short but really informative making-of featurette and a couple of galleries for posters and still shots. I would've loved a commentary on this, as the director seems to speak fluent English in the featurette.",1236988800,2,2744,4.659090909090909
3704138,5,B001MYIXAW,I really enjoyed this movie.  It has just the right mixture of horror and suspense.  I watched a sub-titled version.  The version here is dubbed in english.  The main characters are a boy and young female vampire.  There is also a serial killer.  If your the type that wants a movie where someone gets stabbed or killed every 30 seconds this isn't for you.  If you like more suspense in your horror and something very well done this is your movie.  I really liked the last few minutes of the movie!,1236988800,,498,4.395604395604396
3704139,5,B001MYIXAW,"The night I watched this movie, I woke up screaming from my first nightmare in more than 20 years. As you watch the film you are aware of the beautiful camera work, the intricate story, and the very bad English voice over. But you don't think you are terrified of the 12 year old vampire girl. Later on the horror creeps into you in an almost subliminal way. Over and over you recall every ghoulish detail. Wow, I almost wish I hadn't watched this movie!",1236988800,4,454,4.352941176470588
3704140,2,B001MYIXAW,"I read the book and was really excited about the DVD coming out, so I pre-ordered it.  I will have to say that I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money.  The book is hands down much better. It is like all the BEST parts of the book were cut from being in the movie. There are so many areas that the movie strays away from the books original plots that I don't even know where to begin to give examples.",1236988800,3,400,3.925925925925926
3704141,5,B001MYIXAW,"If you haven't seen this and you are considering buying it - you should. It is a tremendous film. Follow your instincts on this one and go in blind. Any plot details I could give away would detract from your enjoyment. This film will restore your faith in the vampire genre, the horror genre, and the art of film making. Worth ten times the price they're selling it for.",1236902400,,370,4.3768115942028984
3704142,4,B001MYIXAW,"This review is for the Blu-Ray watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma, and BD35 Player. The picture and sound are adequate, with a bit of noise in some scenes, but overall, very sharp and clear. If you're a fan of the film, the purchase is definitely worth it.

I am a fan of ""different"" takes on the same story,and tend to gravitate towards slower-paced,thought provoking films. However, though I thought this film was an interesting departure from the typical vampire flick, I found the film did not provide enough detail for me, and the pace was a bit too slow. The angst of the bullied Oscar, and Eli, who is obviously tortured by her ""prison"" of needing blood and being isolated are effective in creating a child-based vampire film, but I felt at the end, that it would have been helpful if there was a bit more background in the special features (only contains some posters, a brief commentary).

Though I like open ended films, and don't long for a ""spoon-fed"" story, this one was a bit bare boned for me. The end scene, of Oscar tapping on the box was heart breaking and predicted, perhaps, a lifetime of sadness, longing and an eventual need to turn himself, as he'd become old, and lose Eli eventually. I also liked the fact that there was not a sexual component within the vampir myth, as the main characters are children. It allowed the film maker to create a violent, yet touching journey, withou the complications of sexual undertones, which often dilute the strength and need of real character development.

I initially attempted to watch the English dubbed version (I was not sure if the film just starred Swedish actors, who spoke English, or if it was in Swedish-I didn't want to spoil my perception of the film, by reading ANY details). But I decided to watch the film in its native language,with English subs-the dubbing, as in most dubbed films, that I've watched is hideous and comical.

I was going to give this a 3/5, as I did not enjoy the lack of detail, and had a few minor issues with the picture and sound. However, for its originality, and courage to tackle the vampire myth through a child's eyes, I decided to give it a 4/5. Definitely worth a look-this is a story of unconditional acceptance, as the sad reality of these two characters is still based on a 12-year old's innocent perception of the world.",1236902400,,2331,4.609638554216867
3704143,4,B001MYIXAW,"Let the Right One In has the trappings of some of the worst movie cliches ever; its a vampire movie, a coming-of-age story, a buddy movie- and yet it is completely unlike anything I've ever seen.

It unfolds with a quiet precision, as luminous and mesmerizing as the best of the early silent horror movies. Set in Sweden, the story follows the outcast Oskar, full of rage at the bullying of his peers, and Eli, the mysterious young girl who moves into the apartment next door. The two gradually begin to understand and love each other, accepting even the darkest and most frightening parts of the other's nature.

The violence and blood in the film is understated, in fact it gives a totally original and stunning meaning to the words ""off-screen"", but it is nonetheless shocking when it comes. The young actors convey a wonderful combination of solemnity and innocence, they really look and sound like children- but, all puns aside, children of the night.",1236902400,2,956,4.787878787878788
3704144,4,B001MYIXAW,"This is not the best vampire movie ever made. The cover box claims this and that is certainly not the case.  However this is a excellent vampire horror movie that has a long pedigree in film.  This isn't a horror movie pedigree but instead the idea of a friendless outcast boy finding a friend or champion in a stronger person or in this case a vampire girl.  The story is well acted and I didn't mind  the english dubbing at all. They should have offered a subtitled version but that is not a real problem in enjoying this movie. And it is enjoyable with richly defined lead characters and good special effects.  Fans of fun and fast moving gross out movies who don't want a drama context and a solid story might not like this one. However  Those fans need to branch out though into this type of story driven horror flick too ,as they are excellent too.  This is a story that is like a fairy tale story of old in some ways. And those were bloody tales when they were first told too.  This movie focuses on the relationship between the two lead characters as much as the violence and horror.  This movie reminded me of the classic horror flick Beauty and the beast (the 1946 version) in it's careful attention to detail in characterization and that's a great horror movie from that period.  On blu ray this movie looks great which really brings out the excellent photography of the frozen swedish landscape of the story.  This is just a well done movie that even people who aren't horror fans can enjoy.",1236902400,,1503,4.4489051094890515
3704145,5,B001MYIXAW,"""Let the Right One In"" is among the most striking vampire films I've seen. It is less a horror film than a drama with a horrific premise that jumps out at the audience every once in while. The film was directed by Tomas Alfredson from a screenplay written by John Ajvide Lindqvist, author of the novel on which it is based. In a working class suburb of Stockholm in the early 1980s, a frail, bookish 12-year-old named Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is terrorized by bullies at his school, while a murderer who drains his victims' blood stalks the community. Oskar is miserable, without friends or any obvious self-esteem. One evening, he is approached by Eli (Lina Leandersson), a 12-year-old girl who recently moved into his building. Eli is as socially isolated as Oskar is, but she could be a dangerous friend to have.

The violence that lies beneath the nearly silent, snow-covered exterior is the scary part. It's cold. The population seems affable but disaffected. The efforts of Eli's keeper (Per Ragnar) to procure blood for her are so mundane and matter-of-fact that their violence is all the more startling. Yet I almost pitied him his difficulties. Oskar's mounting anger threatens to explode. Eli is a haunting girl with dark hair and big, blue eyes, possessed of a calm resignation and no aversion to killing. The film achieves its creepiness through a measured pace, quiet setting, and a refusal to spell anything out for us. We're never certain what's going to happen or even what we want to happen. We come to understand Eli's predicament slowly. In the end, I wasn't sure what I thought of her, but Eli made a strong impression. In Swedish with optional subtitles.

The DVD (Magnolia 2009): Bonus features include 4 deleted scenes, a Photo Gallery of 20 production stills, a Theatrical Poster Gallery of 5 posters, and a ""Behind the Scenes"" (7 1/2 min) featurette in which director Tomas Alfredson talks about the movie, casting, and characters. Subtitles are available in English, English narrative, and Spanish. Dubbing available in English.",1236902400,,2052,4.944927536231884
3704146,3,B001MYIXAW,"WARNING! SPOILERS, please do not read further if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the movie.

This movie is HALF-RIGHT because of the reasons listed below.

THE GOOD

- The plot is ORIGINAL. I've never seen a movie where a girl of 12 years old was a vampire. She killed and sucked the blood out of people.

- The movie brings up a social dilemma. That is if a child of 12 years committed a murder, should he/she be tried as an adult or a juvenile? What makes some people angry is juvenile punishment is like a slap on the wrist.

- The acting of the actress who portrays Eli is fascinating. She makes me keep watching and watching.

- There are some very bloody scenes that will keep gore fans happy.

THE BAD

- The pace is slow compared to Hollywood movies.

- The main actor who portrays Oskar does not show emotion on his face.

- There's no suspense. Curiosity is what made me watching this till the end, not suspense.

- There's one scene which is very disturbing. In my opinion, it borders child pornography. That is the scene where Eli visited Oskar in his apartment. Oskar had her changed in to one of his mother's dresses. Then he accidentally saw her private part. Why did the director have to include that scene? It does not have anything to do with the plot at all.

Overall, it's absolutely worth watching.",1236816000,,1308,4.381742738589212
3704147,5,B001MYIXAW,"I don't even need to write a review about this one, this movie is fantastic.  It's a heart felt horror movie.  The way a vampire movie should be, not like the wussy Twilight.  This is the best movie of 2009, so far.",1236816000,,215,4.071428571428571
3704148,5,B001MYIXAW,"I was unsure how an unknown Swedish group could do with a BD transfer, and I will admit - I was impressed with everything (almost). From the menu sounds/pic to the amount of audio/sub selections to the DTS. Unfortunately, the extras were mediocre, but the quality of the transfer makes for the only 5-star I have given with a semi-bare BD.

The picture was superb throughout, but only if your white balance and related settings are done correctly. The amount of snowscapes and fair skin mingled with blood and darkness makes for a competent test of the display. I had this one playing on a Panasonic 58 and there was a temperant difference in between settings (over-saturation, line blur, etc.).

The sound was exquisite. I listened to both the English DTS and the Swedish DTS, and the difference was notable. Mistakenly I had both English subs on with the dub - that was a mess. They should try to hire the same company to do both, it seemed like two different movies so I would recommend to skip the dub version. The outer channels were used extensively, and if anything, turn up the menu (wind, snow, water) to hear some wonderfully subtle decibels. Refresh rate test: the scene where the lights get turned off in the gym.

The extras are light, with a seven minute behind the scenes and a pic gallery of our unknown cast. Definitely an owner for the fans of this film, and even with as subtle as the majority of this film is, the channels and display get a fair workout.",1236816000,,1474,4.554716981132075
3704149,5,B001MYIXAW,"""Let the Right One In"" is a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but 'Let the Right One In' is so-well directed and well-cast that all of these themes fall seamlessly into place within the almost 2 hrs running time.

I was riveted from beginning till the end, and the one word that kept coming back to me as I watched this movie was ""hypnotic"" - the story is of 12-year-old Oskar [Kare Hedebrant] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Oskar doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow abounding all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Oskar meets a strange girl named Eli [Lina Leandersson] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Despite this, the pair are drawn to each other, even while Oskar updates his scrapbook with the latest news of gruesome murders in his town, where the victims are tied up and strung upside down before having their blood drained. Much later, Oskar who is by now completely infatuated with Eli, learns a shocking truth that has some important repercussions on both his friendship with Eli and for those around him.

""Let the Right One In"" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Oskar & Eli learn to manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role - Eli commands Oskar to stand up for himself, and later Oskar finds himself as Eli's protector.

The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire ""I must be gone and live, or stay and die"" - a young yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.

""Let the Right One In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see.",1236729600,2,2682,4.712153518123667
3704150,4,B001MYIXAW,"""Let The Right One In""
(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2009)
-------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Spoilers below.
-------------------------------------------------
In this slow, sad Swedish vampire film, a gloomy young boy named Oskar falls under the spell of a magnetic child-sized vampire named Eli... Eli moves in next door to Oskar in a large, dull, modern apartment complex where Oskar often flees to escape the cruel attentions of several sadistic school bullies. Eli sees his dilemma, and encourages Oskar to fight back, even though he is too puny to defend himself without resorting to violent, Columbine-like tactics. As Eli's vampirism slowly becomes apparent, both to Oskar and to the angry locals, the two twelve-year-olds -- one eternal, the other mortal -- grow closer and more co-dependent. Although the film is notably low-budget (and poorly dubbed, in the American re-release) it succeeds on a deeper psychological level, as viewers are constantly made to doubt Eli's altruism towards the hapless, vulnerable Oskar. Their puppy-love relationship is complicated by the revelation that Eli (pronounced like Ellie, the girl's name) was once male, a twist that is sure to be left out of the currently-scheduled American remake... Although this film is low-rent and a bit awkward, it packs a potent psychic wallop: fans of Anne Rice's ""Interview With A Vampire"" (the book, not the film) will love this as well.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film review blog)",1236729600,,1480,5.548672566371682
3704151,5,B001MYIXAW,"I am pleased that the movie makers were faitful to the book. Two main characters were deleted and a plotline changed with Eli's caretaker but I can live with that. The movie kept to the spirit and mystery of the book. The only problem was the ""revelation"" of Eli's sexuality. Having read the book, I was prepared and understood what it meant but I do think the movie could have delved into Eli's backstory just a bit.

Watching the movie, the viewer understands that Oskar wants to strike back against the bullies yet has never been coached how to do so. When we see him finally strike out at his main bully, we also see a self-satisfied smile creep along Oskars face. We wonder, would he make a good vampire himself?

Reading the book does help understand what is going on but it is not necessary. I enjoyed the movie a great deal. Much of the movie is visual, without added dialouge. I hope the US version keeps to the spirit and does not alter the story into just another slasher/adventure tale.

The ending of the movie actually helps explain things a little bit better than the book. I liked the fact that the ending is basically the same but with a little added twist.

Get this movie. It does not matter if you have not read the book first because once you see the movie, you will want to read the story.

Enjoy!",1236729600,,1319,4.389344262295082
3704152,5,B001MYIXAW,"I have always had a strong fondness for vampire films. Honestly, much of the vampire films these days are full of clich&eacute; and while most of them does attempt at something original, they all have one common denominator; to induce HORROR. Well, Sweden seems to have mastered an original take on the vampire lore and yes, this film has been marked to be ""Americanized"" very soon. ""Let the Right One In"" is a film adapted from the novel and written for the screen by John Ajvide Lindqvist with very powerful direction by Thomas Alfredson. Rather than a vampire film geared to induce scares, this film is heavy on mood that will definitely terrify and touch our very hearts.

Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is a 12-year old boy whose parents are separated, he collects news clippings, and who gets bullied in school by his classmates. He usually wanders his apartment grounds at night while pining for vengeance against his tormentors. One evening, he meets Eli (superbly played by Lina Leanderson), a mysterious young girl of the same age with whom Oskar forms a provisional friendship. The two become quite close, as bizarre murders begin to run rampant in their community. Eli is a girl with powers that Oskar can barely understand, and she sees Oskar as an innocent, kindly soul worth preserving. Oskar sees Eli as his friend and confidant, as he becomes attracted to her. However, Eli has been twelve for quite a long time--she is a vampire. Their world is about to fall apart as things begin to spiral out of control.

Ever wonder what would happen if a 12 year old girl is turned into a vampire at such an early age? Being an immortal stuck at this pre-teen age can become quite complicated. Well, this Swedish vampire tale attempts to answer that question. The film is a moody affair and is full of hauntingly effective emotions. The film's main focus is the relationship between Eli and Oskar, and Eli as an immortal with a tortured soul and a conscience. ""..Right One"" observes the nave sensuality between pre-teens and the brutality of having to kill to survive. As an immortal, Eli is longing for companionship, there is a subtle hint that the man who brought her into Oskar's apartment complex isn't exactly her father but that definition isn't really revealed which gives Eli a sense of being an enigma.

Eli isn't a villain, but rather also a victim. It was wise for the screenplay to treat her as another casualty rather than the antagonist--her situation itself is the film's ""bad guy"". ""..Right One"" is also a thematic affair in regards to isolation, loneliness as reflected by our two leads, and an empty life to live that requires viciousness to survive. The direction has a methodical approach, as it slowly brings Eli and Oskar together, introduces the violence without any elucidation to build on the film's psychological impact. Director Alfredson cleverly plays on how each scene of violence is shown, the violence is brutal but never for a minute do we forget about feeling sympathetic to Eli's situation. He allows the sympathy to steadily build within his audience but never for a minute does he forget to hold the viewer's interest. The way the film is shot is a form of minimalism, it avoids fancy camera shots, it lingers on some scenes to convey its mood and uses a lot of perspective. The film looks gorgeous, and the atmosphere has that darkly foreboding look that exudes sympathy accentuated further by its soundtrack.

Of course, the film does have its dose of blood and gore, but it is very calculated. Most of it occur throughout the film as it builds towards its excellent climax. ""..Right One"" also has the usual rules that apply to vampires; vulnerability to sunlight, dependent on blood for sustenance, the usual powers, and the need to be invited to one's home. (It was quite interesting to see what happens to a vampire when they aren't invited to come in one's home). Eli kills her prey after she gets her fill, she doesn't want to turn anyone and she only kills because she has to. The performances by Lina Leanderson and Kare Hedebrant is just brilliant with their simplicity and the two never for a moment falter in showing their age. Their awkward but endearing relationship is the film's showstopper as it endears, charms, frightens and explores the boundaries of their friendship.

Now, don't think that Alfredson and Lindqvist does nothing else with the script. When we aren't watching Eli and Oskar, we become privy to the paranoid community as they talk and gossip about the murders. The film goes into poetic visceral overdrive as a mistake becomes the turning point for our young leads and all hell threatens everything and turns the wheels of destiny.

I highly doubt that this film would translate well in becoming ""Americanized"" in its intended remake, given its very distinct European roots (as with the case with Asian Horror). ""Let the Right One In"" perfectly balances visceral punch with thrilling emotions that takes its brutality into sincere purity. The film takes some chances and I commend it for asking us to forgive a child and to accept her form of evil--to give her a show of compassion and sympathy. The film is grisly, grotesque, unnervingly beautiful and gentle, and is a welcome installment in vampire lore. It features the concerns of pre-teens mixing it in with waiflike atmosphere. It is one dishearteningly stupendous art house horror film!

Highly Recommended! [5-Stars]",1236643200,,5444,4.859913793103448
3704153,5,B001MYIXAW,"The vampire genre has been done to death so many times that finding something new and exciting about it often feels like fighting a losing battle.  That's why we should be thankful for Let the Right One In, a Swedish import that puts a thoughtful, haunting, and surprisingly touching stamp on vampire lore.  The film revolves around Oskar (Kre Hedebrant), a twelve year old who is constantly bullied and yearns for revenge against his tormenters.  He comes across a girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson), who over time he learns to be a vampire, and with whom he finds both love and a method of vengeance.  If it sounds like Twilight to you at all, just ignore that thought.  Let the Right One In can be considered what an adult take on Twilight could be, with brilliant performances, a dark and poetic tone, and an actually thought provoking screenplay.  Tomas Alfredson's direction is hypnotic as well, luring the viewer into this world that also manages to provide a good amount of shocks as well.  Rumor has it that this film is being fast-tracked to be remade for American audiences.  If that is the case (which I certainly hope it isn't) then it is also all the more reason that you should check out Let the Right One In.  It is a brilliant, thought provoking film that soars well above its genre, and it deserves your time and attention.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a modern day classic.",1236643200,2,1393,4.626016260162602
3704154,4,B001MYIXAW,"Hollywood has always thought of itself as the be all to end all. But the elite have always held fast that foreign films were the way to go. So Hollywood has chosen to remake a number of foreign films with highs and lows in success. A new film is already set for remake but this week finds the original released on DVD.

LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is a hybrid film. By hybrid think of combining films. The western and sci fi flicks were married in STAR WARS. Musicals and romance films in STEP UP. This film is an even stranger mix combining coming of age, romance and horror. But then vampires and romance seem to have gone hand in hand forever, just not quite this young.

Oskar is a 12 year old growing up in a city in Sweden. His life is fairly boring with the exception of the school bully picking on him most of the time and Oskar doing nothing in retaliation.

A new neighbor moves into the apartment next to Oskar and his mother, a late middle aged man and a young girl. Oskar notices the covered windows but doesn't realize why until much later.

Sitting in the courtyard on the jungle gym, Oskar first meets Eli. Clad in thing clothes and barefoot, he asks if she isn't cold. Her reply is that she isn't that she doesn't remember how to be cold. And so begins an unusual friendship.

The man living with Eli is her benefactor. His job is to provide her a place to stay and fresh blood so that she doesn't have to go out and hunt, thus placing herself in jeopardy. But he's beginning to slow down, failing to complete the tasks. While one victim does die, his blood isn't captured and brought home requiring Eli to go out on her own. The attack is simple but seen and when people begin to talk about a child killing a full grown man, few believe the tale.

Oskar and Eli begin to spend time together while Oskar's mother is at work. The required invitation to a vampire for entry is offered and Eli enters the apartment. But Oskar still doesn't realize exactly what Eli is.

When an encounter with the school bully and his pals results in Oskar having a slice on his cheek he lies to Eli (and his mother) about how he got the injury. But Eli sees the truth. And her advice to Oskar is that the next time it happens, to make sure and hit the bully...hard.

The film moves slowly, taking it's time with the timid pacing to set the stage. We begin to see Oskar starting to have a bit more confidence in himself. And when he finally does take on the bully, we cheer for him and at the same time worry that he will be changed to a more horrendous figure.

As for Eli, her need to attack comes out after her benefactor fails his own plot for murder, leaving her with no one to fetch nourishment for her. The attacks she makes are the most disturbing images seen in this film. Thoughts of a child doing such horrible deeds are the things of nightmares.

Eli reveals herself to Oskar but not before he puts her to a test: entering his apartment without the required invitation. The results are disturbing but soon forgotten. The strangest part is that Oskar has moved from his timid victim to a defensive individual able to stand up for himself, even to Eli.

When the murders begin to set the stage for Eli being caught its time to move on. But not before one final moment when Oskar is beset not by just the bully but by his older brother, a budding psychopath if there ever was one.

LET THE RIGHT ONE IN has been hailed as a terrifying film for fans of the genre. But as I watched I never found myself frightened. I did find the film fascinating in its depiction of a world I've never seen, Sweden. And the characters were enough to hold my interest, especially the interaction between the pair as they discovered one another.

If your cup of tea is the rapid paced films seen more often than not then this movie isn't for you. If you like something with a bit more substance that takes it's time to tell you the story then you might want to give it a try. The effects are not gore filled, the feeling is eerie and the tale is original. And once the story finishes, you might think twice before opening the door to anyone.",1236643200,4,4120,4.280205655526992

I do have to admit that there are parts of ""Let The Right One In"" that could have been paced a little faster and some deleted scenes that should have been kept in, but over all a great film.

I am not a big fan of vampire literature, but this story is so beautiful and the film is so well done that it will hunt you for a long time.  It will hunt you, I might add only if you are open to non-conformist, exceptional and personal cinema.  It was a small US release in 2008, and not surprisingly it was overlooked by the Oscars Group.  Is it a horror film? It could be. A love story? Definitely. Thriller? Not really.  It is a film full of surprises, enigma and metaphors.  Especially, I love the brilliant music by Johan Sderqvis and the two fine young actors playing Eli and Oscar.  The cat scene? Just have a great time watching it.  The end scene? Always remember, what goes around comes around, but most importantly, as much as possible, or whenever possible: let the right ONE into your life.

3704157,5,B001MYIXAW,"I'm going to try to keep this short since I loved both the book and the film. If you're familiar with the novel do know that John Ajdive Lindgvist who wrote both the novel and screenplay excised a lot of the more horrific stuff from the film. Also gone was the humor involving Tommy the stoner kid who takes to harassing his soon to be stepfather while the turning of Virginia is shorter and sweeter in a way. One of the strong points of Tomas Alfredson's film is just how subtle it is in telling the story of how a bullied twelve year old forms a relationship with a child vampire. Theres not a lot of frentic camera movement and editing with some nice long shots combined with superb image composition. While Eli described in the book is almost animalistic when she needs to feed the film seems to have two people playing her at times while hinting at her power through small shots. It also smartly plays up something not really done in the book with Eli's view towards killing people and how she uses Hakan not only as a caretaker but as a willing person to collect blood. I won't describe anymore but the ending while not unfortunately having a scene where Eli needs to be invited in to save Oskar from bullies, is simpler and more brutal in a way. If I had one complaint its a small one involving the fate of Hakan that isn't really given a good explanation. Other than that everything makes this a perfect horror film in my opinion.
The DVD as it is has excellent picture but doesn't feature a whole lot in the way of extras. Theres a making of where Alfredson basically talks for ten minutes on the making of. Theres six deleted scenes and after that a picture gallery and poster gallery. I'm kind of disappointed that the disc defaults to an English dub but other than that with the price and the availabilty I do hope people check this one out before the American remake comes out. I'm reserved in my judgement of that film but this one is a classic of the genre.",1236643200,2,1972,4.376021798365122

3704159,5,B001MYIXAW,"While watching this film on the big screen just yesterday, I was struck by the realization that perhaps no other genre of film plays so heavily on architecture than the vampire film. This modern, contemporary, even human -- vampire story is no different, but is also very different. Rather than the cliche dark forboding castle or gothic mansion, we have the unsettling normalcy of the empty spaces of the modern world. In fact, it is through this interplay between the entrapment of enclosed spaces and the vulnerability of open spaces that most of this film's suspense is built. That, and the crossing over from the lighted space to the dark and vice versa are deftly, almost subliminally, handled. Two scenes, edited crisply together, really represent the permeability of thresholds (and our blithe obliviousness to them) quite aptly -- young Oskar shuts the lights off in an empty classroom, and then steps from the darkened space of the room to the well lit hallway. Instantly we are edited to a shot of him emerging from the well lit building into the darkened space of the out of doors on a wintery Swedish afternoon, where the trio of bullies await. Almost all of the most tiresome and cliche aspects of the vampire legend, with all its baggage, are missing here. By having the main characters so young, and the girl as vampire, the legend is interestingly DE (and then RE) sexualized. In an awkward scene with Oskar, his estranged father and another man (dad's gay partner?) the theme of lonliness and heartache is lingered over yet again. There are also overtones of Von Sternberg's ""The Blue Angel"" (the clown who lingers in Lola Lola's shadow that we encounter when Emil Janning's professor character first meets her...) that inform this films conclusion (No spoilers here!) Like everyone else says, this film is beautifully shot, wonderfully lit by the natural glow of the dying sun and the eerie glare of the incandescent bulbs of walkways, intersections, bridges. Besides Murnau's historic ""Nosferatu"" and Herzog's romantic remake of same, I've never had much use for the vampire film. This is a very special film -- one you'll think about for days after seeing it. You might not be scared, but you will be haunted.",1235952000,4,2230,4.902116402116402
3704160,5,B001MYIXAW,"Vampires have always been creatures with romantic and tragic sensibilities. They want blood, but all along, they merely want love. Meeting these two goals complicate things in any states of normalcy. That is why when one wants to explore subjects of mortality, and doomed love affairs, vampires are perfect metaphors to use. The Swedish treat ""Let The Right One In"" gets this perfectly right, and this is the film what the innocuous and limpid ""Twilight"" series wants to be: perfect blend of doomed yet achingly sweet and tender romance, and skin-crawling horror, topped off with believable - and regardless whether or not they're sporting sharp teeth - three-dimensional characters. The film works on many levels: as a coming out tale, a coming of age one, a horror dramady, an artful and thoughtful independent work that Ingmar Bergman would have been proud of. Regardless, it is romantic, scary and ruminative, bringing fresh blood into the veins of a dying genre.",1235952000,2,967,5.088050314465409
3704161,5,B001MYIXAW,"Why is it every single movie I've really loved in the past few years has been a foreign film or directed by a non-American? United 93, Once, 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days...I could go on and on.

The latest great film not from the American/Hollywood model is Let The Right One In, a Swedish vampire film that is so self-assured, so perfect in its execution, I can easily name it the Best Film I've Seen in 2008. The screenplay was written by John Ajvide Lindqvist and it's based on his novel of the same name.

Oskar is a 12 year-old boy living a lonely life with his single mom in a nondescript apartment complex on the outskirts of Stockholm. He gets along with his mother, visits his kindly Dad on a farm and has revenge fantasies against the bullies who pick on him at school. One night, an older man and a 12 year old girl move in next door, immediately covering up all the windows in the apartment from the outside light.

The girl's name is Elie, and she is a vampire. The man is her human caretaker and he does so by murdering people and draining their blood so that Eli can survive.

Eli is also a lonely child, and she and Oskar begin a sweet friendship, and later, romance. Both actors who play Oskar and Eli are remarkable. Oskar is that odd, lonely boy we all know and Eli is otherworldly with eyes so mesmerizing you might actually drown in them.

While it's technically a horror film (and there are some truly chilling moments in it), Let The Right One In is also a beautiful love story and a meditation on that particular Swedish brand of ennui, of loneliness. This is no normal scare-fest, with BOOs! and gore and heroes fighting off the evil bloodsuckers. This is the kind of movie a Bergman or a Kieslowski would've made in their prime. Yes, it's a vampire film - but it is also High Art and a masterpiece of film making.

Director Alfredson composes each shot with such meticulous care, such originality, I was constantly blown away by his framing and editing choices. The look is as monochromatic as a Swedish winter, with bright splashed of red - blood in snow can be pretty startling! The movie is shot in mostly wide shots contrasted with extreme close-ups and a very narrow depth of field, with very few instances of anything in between. It creates a visual theme for both Oskar and Eli that directly relates to both the loneliness and intimacy of being both a Vampire and a preteen on the verge of of puberty, with all the confusion and sexual tension and excitement that that entails.

Which brings me back to my comparison to Hollywood films and the difference between how composition and framing is actually used: in most Hollywood fare, the movies look fantastic but its visuals are rarely shot for use as a thematic device, as a way to further tell the story - it's all just pretty pictures, shot with a shiny gloss that is interchangeable with a Bud Lite commercial. Most of the great foreign films use composition and lighting and framing as a way to tell the story - as an integral part of the story-telling, as important as the dialogue or plot.

What does this add to the final product? It creates art out of genre, new meaning out of the familiar. It also allows the film maker to tell his story without bludgeoning his audience over the head with artless exposition and boring dialogue.

Let The Right One In reveals its story in its images. The way the movie hints that Eli and her Carekeeper might have started out exactly as her love story with Oskar. The way a victim of Eli's who was not killed turns into a vampire herself and cannot live with what she has become. It's all in the way the film is told, in what's revealed to us - Alfredson does not introduce his characters in the standard Hollywood way; there is no ""motivation"" beyond survival and love. Each character seems fully formed as soon as they appear on screen going about their day as if they have a real history and aren't merely a screenwriters' figment and shortcut to advance the plot.

There are some truly scary moments in the film - when Eli scales a building like a spider or when the one victim of Eli's attack is herself attacked by many cats who sense her changing into the undead. Vampire conventions we all know by heart are all given a neat twist that both advances the vampire legend and grounds them in a firm reality that makes everything that much more frightening.

And if you've ever wanted to know what would happen to a vampire if he entered a house without first being invited in - this is your chance to see! In fact, the title of the movie is a clever pun on that Vampiric lore.

Let the Right One In is a great film. The best of the year, by far.",1235865600,5,4678,4.41415313225058

3704164,5,B001MYIXAW,"In my opinion Vampires and Vampire mythology has run their course during the last 5 years. We have seem them displayed in every possible way in the forms of books, movies and the latest; TV series. With that said, ""Let The Right One In"" breathes new life into this genre a true, rare and sensitive movie, yet so real and mesmerising.

Tomas Alfredson's carefully adapted thriller from the Swedish best-seller by John Ajvide Lindqvist is done with tender loving care which is why ""Let the Right One In"" is such a refreshing surprise: A bloodsucker story that's rich with originality and feeling, a terrific love story and vampire tome that not only rewards the genre's fans but rekindles interest in its virtually exhausted foundations.

Kare Hedebrant plays Oskar, a transparent Swedish youth who is tormented and bullied daily at school. In comes Eli (Lina Leandersson) who moves in next door and they form a friendship that is so tender. Soon, Oskar and Eli develop a tenuous romance, even as she is forced to decide whether she will stay with him or retreat from view where she can continue feeding without attracting attention from the authorities.

Unlike most of the vampire films that preceded it in recent years, Let the Right One In is truly a unique tale even though the protagonist is a 12-year-old boy obviously changes the dynamic of the story, but it's really the tender romance between him and Eli that gives the film its emotional resonance.",1235174400,,1457,4.843373493975903

Most horror films are set in haunted houses or spooky castles on rainy nights, but this one takes place in modern Swedish highrises, all of their surfaces white and smooth and sterile -- until they're splashed with blood. These buildings are surrounded by drifts of snow and illuminated by the alternately harsh and gloomy light of a Scandinavian winter.

The impassive Nordic faces of the movie's characters conceal terrible loneliness and brutality, and their predicaments are revealed at a slow, deliberate pace, punctuated by shocking violence. That most of this violence is perpetrated by children and that the children are driven by forces both moral and amoral further deepens the film's complexity.

also, if played on a ps3, for some reason directional pad and x do not work for playback options. you must rewind/fast forward with l2 and r2, and you must play with start button. this is the first time ive seen this on a bluray, usually you can just use left n right on the dpad, and you can just press x to play. not with this bluray.

extras were kinda lame. i mainly bought the bluray for the extras, as i wanted more backround on the characters and stuff.

the deleted scenes are only four short clips that don't really add much value. one shows oskar tapping elis back and singing a song, another shows that lady vampire (one eli bit) vomiting, another shows oskar playing rough with eli and making vampire sounds, i suppose, just playing (that was probably the best deleted scene, but i can see why it was taken out), and then another one shows a bully scene where that kid at school makes him make pig sounds and then you see oskars pee ball, but theres no explanation so if you haven't read the book you won't know what it is anyway.

behind the scenes is like 7 mins long, poor video quality, and they basically just show you some of the filming in progress, how they did the pool scene, the movie maker explaining the environment in the film. it was alright...

3704175,5,B001MYIXAW,I've been a fan of vampire movies since my mother took me to see one as a little kid in the 60s. This one stands out as the most memorable.  The director creates a geniune feeling of loneliness and dread.  It is a bittersweet love story where in the end Eli gets what she needs and you are left to wonder how many times she has done this in the past.  Very well acted and directed and genuinely creepy.,1232928000,2,402,4.063291139240507
3704176,5,B001MYIXAW,"Saw this twice. Once at Fantastic Fest and recently at an art house theater and I loved it both times (I think I enjoyed it better the second time around!). This film is just too good. Instead of focusing on vampires, vampires play only a small role in this film about adolescence and loneliness... There is no reason anyone with a taste for good filmmaking would want to pass this one up. The cinematography and score were both brilliant. They truly make the often bleak and dreary settings beautiful. You will not want it to end!!

For those who enjoyed the film, the book is much, much better with two more main characters, a completely different climax (which I was hoping made it in the film), and more about Eli's caretaker...",1232841600,3,732,4.587786259541985
3704177,5,B001MYIXAW,"To describe this move as a horror movie is to miss the primary themes underlying it.  I'll try to limit repeating what others have said about its background.  Oskar lives in a stark, lonely world where nobody seems able or willing to take the time to understand the pain caused him by cruel classmates at school.  His parents display affection but remain distant, too busy with their own worries.  Oskar senses this and does not confide in either parent.  He has nobody, no one to feel his pain.  Until Eli.

Like Oskar, Eli holds a dark secret of her own.  She must kill to survive, yet there is a very human side to her that does not delight in inflicting pain. Nobody, not even the one person who knows her secret, understands the conflicts in her heart, her desire not to be cruel combined with the need to kill in order to live.  Eli's affection for Oskar comes through in small yet significant gestures that viewers may not realize until after the movie.  At one point, she even risks her existence to show Oskar who she is and that she can be vulnerable.  Like Oskar and even more so, Eli is alone to deal with these unsolvable conflicts.

Tomas Alfredson brilliantly captures the barren, emotional desert in which Oskar and Eli live.  The direction is focused but restrained.  The excellent musical score complemented the movie well.  Alfredson draws the viewer into this lonely world where two people find in each other a strength, a hope and discover that perhaps their world is not as lonely as they had once believed it to be.

Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson are brilliant in their acting debuts.  Both bring an innocence and refreshing simplicity that make the complex roles they play easily believable.  It's hard to imagine anyone else in these roles and while I'm not opposed to the remake being made in the US, my expectations are minimal, so much so that I don't plan on seeing it unless the reviews are stellar.  I can't see any remake being as good as Alfredson's original.  This movie is that good.  Big budget doesn't equate to excellence.

Thanks to the brilliant directing and acting, anyone who has struggled with loneliness will find much to identify with in this movie.  It simply captures you.  The themes in this move are like still water.  They run deep and I expect to be thinking of the themes for some time.  Like the book and musical score, this wonderful movie goes into my collection when the DVD is released.  This movie is destined to become a classic, an underappreciated gem.

IMPORTANT EDIT!!!!!  The DVD release is NOT THE SAME FILM I WATCHED IN THE THEATER.  Magnet ruined it with changes to the subtitles and the musical score seems  softer at least to me.  Don't waste your money until Magnet changes the LOUSY subtitles.  Even better yet, get a copy from a region outside North America that wasn't ruined by Magnet's bonehead revisions!  Just be sure that you have a player that can play other region coded DVDs.",1232841600,8,2963,4.645472061657033
3704178,5,B001MYIXAW,"We just saw this movie last night at the Detroit Film Theater and it was amazing.
  I would agree with another reviewer that it was better than The Dark Night.  Personally I think this should have been best picture of the year.
  There are some twists on the vampire lore but they are to the betterment of the genre.
  This is a dark movie about a sad lonely boy who is coming of age, dealing with bullies and suddenly meets a young girl who he befriends.
  The gore is kept so short sudden bursts and each has meaning in driving home the story.  I never felt that it was simply a slasher flick because each act leads to consequences.
  I have heard that the book differs at several interesting points with this movie but there are hints at the two major points I can think of.
  I kind of wish they had spent a minute or two fleshing out his mother, given the movies ending, as well as gave a bit more info on his father. The father story left me wondering wether alcoholism led to his situation but then again there could even be a creepier element there.
  There is a sadness in this movie and there are quesitons as to how Oskar will end up and whether or not there was a purpose in the not a girl characters actions.
  Granted, the age of the characters/actors and the supposed age of one of the character lead to some to suggest this borders on inapppropriate or but my wife and I felt that every shot was key to the film.
  Here is hoping that the skillful hand of this director soon helms many more films.
  I dread the US version of this in 2010 because they will either over play the two elements left out from the book or underplay several vital elements in the movie that made the character development so moving.",1232755200,,1725,4.2592592592592595
3704179,5,B001MYIXAW,"I simply can not get over this movie.
I watched it with english subs, namely because of its 97% RT rating.  All I have to say now is, I'm stunned.  The film succeeds on all levels.  I didn't feel robbed at the end, the ending was unexpected and magnificent.

The main two leads are stunning in their parts, especially the girl.  At the end, the viewer is witness to carnage, but left with no horror, no guilt, nothing but love and happiness towards the doer of the carnage.

I wanted the movie to end before this scene, I thought it should because it was so perfect (besides the violent cat scene), but the addition, and the encounter with Oskar's bullies at the end was triumphent.

Easily the best horror movie of all time and likely has graced the top 15 list for my best all time live action movies.

Del Torro, ever since Pan's Labyrinth, has been a stunningly poignant director, able to match both violence and the deepest emotions of love together in any setting.",1232064000,3,970,4.471590909090909
3704180,5,B001MYIXAW,"Move over, Twilight. Some people know that vampires don't sparkle.

I'm not an expert on the vampire genre itself, but I certainly enjoy it when it's explored well. Let the Right on In does that and more. It's alternatively creepy and wonderful.

Alfredson does an AMAZING job as a director - the film isn't overblown with the (seemingly) obligatory ""scary music"" nor with over-done special effects. When special effects are used, they're used so subtley that you really BELIEVE what you're seeing. The actors - at such young ages - are so convincingly real that it's still hard for me to believe they're so young. The cinematography is equally well done -- it's simple, relying mostly on the starkness of the landscape to help set up the atmosphere for the film.

The relationship that develops between Eli and Oskar has the depth and complexity that most ""Brooding Vampire Falls in Love With Human"" lacks. There are no cliches here. You genuinely dislike Eli for what she is, and simultaneously love her involvement with Oskar. Their relationship is creepy and full of adolescent awkwardness...but touching.

I left the movie blown away and not entirely sure whether I wanted to hide in a church for weeks on end to avoid vampires or go to Sweden and find a vampire of my own.",1231891200,2,1278,4.795454545454546
3704181,5,B001MYIXAW,"""Let the Right one in"" is a vampire movie that takes the idea of vampires seriously. Oskar is a 12-year old lonely boy; he is bullied in school, his parents are broken up and seems to have no friends. Oskar carries around a knife and he fantasizes of using it and taking revenge on his bullies. Then, he meets Eli, a girl that just moved to his apartment complex. Eli is special: she walks barefoot in the snow, doesn't wear a jacket and smells funny. She also has been 12 for a long time and only comes out at night. She is also capable of great violence to satisfy her hunger. Despite these things, Oskar moves past her strange qualities and they become friends. They become each other's life lines and feed the hungry loneliness that surrounds them.

Eli is protective of Oskar and although at one point Oskar is upset about her nature, their friendship is strengthened by each passing moment. The movie is really good. It is dark, gothic, raw and at times disturbing but, it also has humor and tender moments. The nature of Eli's vampirism is somewhat explored but the main theme is that of loneliness and how Oskar and Eli complement each other. The film is beautifully shot and the end result is a great, poetic and amazing scene.",1231804800,2,1236,4.517857142857143

3704183,4,B001MYIXAW,"I'm not sure if I agree with the blurb on the DVD cover about this being ""the best vampire movie ever,"" but if Terrance Mallick was Swedish and decided to make a vampire/suspense movie starring two tweens it might've come out like this film. So much is communicated without language in this film. 'Let the Right One In' quiet and slow paced yet never tedious. The cinematography & directing are both equally beautiful and unsettling, and the performances by the two child leads are compelling throughout.",1231632000,3,504,4.872093023255814
3704184,5,B001MYIXAW,"I saw this movie last night and I'm still processing it.

The least you can say about it is that it is art. It will leave you thinking about it the next day and it will make you feel something. It might not be something that you like but it will be something. This puts it above 85% of the crap churned out by hollywood.
Although it's a very different type of movie, the closest I can come to comparing it would be ""American Beauty"". It is visual, paced, stylized and much of what is says is not in the dialog. Also, the climax is sad and horrifying yet, by the time you get there, you can see it from a perspective where it is beautiful.
Like other reviewers, I find myself hoping that hollywood doesn't screw it up. I want more so I'm going out today and buy the book.",1231632000,5,770,4.099337748344371
3704185,5,B001MYIXAW,"This movie I saw back in Sept at a film fest and over time it stuck with me.  There is so much that makes this film wonderful and sweet.  Oskar is a character that you can't help but embrace, nothing was in his favor til Eli came along and his blind love for her is all the more sweeter as he discovers her secrets.
  TO those that keep mentioning Eli's ""caretaker"" they need to pay more attention,  the man is also not the father but a LOVER of Eli.  This is not a sexual film its about emotions and the purity of love, so that kinda removes the creepy factor of the old man and a 12 yrold girl, ok still a little creepy.
  This film to me is perfect and the thought that Hollywood wants to americanize this is a shame because the studios WILL SCREW THIS UP.  This film deserves all the praise it has recieved and then some.  Its bleak in some respects but that is life.  I agree this isn't much of a traditional horror film and it shouldn't be thought of or viewed as simply a horror film but as a film reflecting the innocence of childhood and the heart of what companionship, friendship, and any relationship should mean.",1231372800,,1125,4.210280373831775
3704186,5,B001MYIXAW,"I swear my movie going experience has become fewer and far between. There are not many movies that interests me. 2008 was a pretty rancid year for movies IMO. I could count on one hand the times I went to the theatre to see a movie. Of the five films I have seen, my favorite film of 2008 is the Swedish film LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.

LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is based on the John Ajvide Lindqvist novel which was originally published as LET ME IN (before it was re-published as LET THE RIGHT ONE IN). John is also responsible for writing the screenplay for the film and I am glad he did. Anyone else would have destroyed the story (I can imagine that will happen with the American butchering of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN).

The film adaptation centers around 12 year old Oskar (Kayre Hedebrant)who is friendless and is constantly bullied by three of his peers at school. His torment is so bad he takes out his frustrations on a tree at night with a knife he had appropriated. One night outside in the frigid cold, Oskar meets 12 year old girl Eli (Lina Leandersson) who had recently moved into his apartment building with an adult male companion named Hakan. Initially the two youngsters are wary of each other but eventually they become friends. What Oskar doesn't know at the time is that Eli doesn't look like what she appears to be and through out the film, the viewer is given subtle glimpses to who Eli really is as a person.

I have read the book and Tomas Alfredson pretty much stays true to the story (with the help of the author himself). There are definite huge chunks of the book left out but probably because Lindqvist wanted the film to focus more on the relationship between Oskar and Eli. I truly loved the film and the storyline. I love how Tomas manages to balance the horrors of Eli's dark, vampire nature with her tender relationship with Oskar. The film is driven by a beautiful classical film score by John Soderqvisk which captures the lonelieness, joy, and terror that comes with the film. The child actors of Kayre and Lina were wonderful to watch. I really enjoyed Lina's performance as Eli which was often heartbreaking especially in the last fifteen-twenty minutes of the film.

LET THE RIGHT ONE IN goes beyond just being a horror film. It is also a character study which the Swedes are quite famous for in their films. I saw this film twice in the theatre and that is rare for me. I am not the horror fan that I once was but I actually enjoyed all of the more violent scenes especially the one involving Virginia and a bunch of cats which made me laugh out loud. Some people might not like the pacing of the film but I found it to be just perfect. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is worth viewing and reading. For me this is the vampire film from 2008 that is worth viewing.",1231286400,3,2782,4.375241779497099
