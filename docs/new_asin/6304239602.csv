7866012,2,6304239602,"Robin Shou's Hong Kong film career remains consistently overshadowed by his Hollywood accomplishments and obscure at best, and when considering lackluster offerings like ""Interpol Connection"", I can't say I'm too eager to excavate the rest of it. What we have here is a truly missed opportunity of Robin abandoning his usual henchman status in favor of a numbingly dull lead role alongside a similarly underutilized Yukari Oshima in a movie so deprived of action that it hardly deserves to be called a Hong Kong picture.

The story: following the death of his partner at the hands of an international crime lord (director Philip Ko,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-on-Fire/dp/B00004RECY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel on Fire</a>), Hong Kong policeman Co Chi Pang (Shou,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>) follows the criminal to the Philippines, where he will need to team with a lethal Japanese Interpol agent (Oshima,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Riki-Oh/dp/B00004TJM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Riki-Oh</a>) to capture the crook.

This movie is so obscure that even websites like HKCinemagic can't provide its full cast list, so I can't even identify the inept and annoying Filipino policeman Shou is also teamed up with. This guy supplies the token comedy portions of the film, but unless you consider a grown man wetting his pants and wearing a bra to be humorous, you'll be as displeased with him as I was. Sadly, this buffoon's antics are the most interesting things you'll witness in the movie's lifeless first 50 minutes: save for a few tired shootouts, there's hardly a trace of action scenes for almost the entire first hour, during which Robin Shou's character investigates stuff and visits a strip joint. Riveting, no?

Yukari Oshima doesn't show up until that 50 minute mark, and luckily, she brings the fights with her. We get four hand-to-hand scenes in the last half-hour, which Oshima is clearly the star of. Action director Dion Lam (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Storm-Riders/dp/B00004RF3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Storm Riders</a>) had yet to come into his niche as one of the best in the business, but he gives her a couple of good brawls: one with a high-kicking henchman that turns into a stickfight and one with Philip Ko during which she spider-climbs a doorframe to pummel him. Shou, on the other hand, has definitely seen better days: though the movie's intro showcases his excellent physique, his single one-on-one fight with another unnamed henchman (who may be Simon Kim from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xtreme-Fighter/dp/B0007Z0OOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xtreme Fighter</a>) features a drastic amount of editing for a Hong Kong movie and a lot of his jumping around in general looks like it was done by a stunt double. Positively not his best work.

On the whole, I give the fight content an average but passing grade, and therein it saves this movie from a one-star rating. It's painful for me to write such a negative review for a film starring a man I admire so much, but it just doesn't have enough redeeming qualities to balance out its negative aspects. Don't waste your money, folks.
