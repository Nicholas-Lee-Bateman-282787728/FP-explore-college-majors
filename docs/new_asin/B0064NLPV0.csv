4951086,5,B0064NLPV0,"Youre a philosophical thinker. And like most people youve stayed up at night wondering what must it be like to be that most beloved of Sesame Street puppets?

Well here is your answer.

Being Elmo is a 2011 documentary that follows the career of Kevin Clash. Kevin started out life like many of us by watching Sesame Street on TV. But while most of us spent our time trying to figure out which of these things is not like the other (a classic segment for those of you who don't remember), Kevin studied the puppetry and developed a life long fascination with the muppets and the mastermind behind them, Jim Henson.

Kevins rise to wild success in his chosen field is the stuff of dreams. He met Henson in the early eighties. While other kids were moving into their college dorms Kevin was working on the venerable Captain Kangaroo (remember that show?). A few years later he had worked on Labyrinth with Henson and got his dream job working on Sesame Street.

Then came Elmo, an unassuming muppet with a thick, gravelly voice.

Yes, you heard me right. Elmo started out with a deep, booming voice. But the muppet wasn't going anywhere and the puppeteers were frustrated with him. One day one of them came into the back room, tossed the unassuming red muppet in Kevins direction, and challenged him to do something with it.

Kevin took up the challenge.

The voice came first. The laugh. The playful eye roll.

But Elmo needed an angle. What would distinguish him from the other muppets? Oscar was the grouch, but what would Elmo be?

Then it hit Kevin: love. Elmo would represent pure love and acceptance. The muppet who would always be ready to give you a hug. Kids resonated, Tickle Me Elmos flew off the shelves (though Kevin noted that Elmo would never say me), and celebrities lined up to get their cameo.

Kevin didn't realize the full impact of Elmo until one day when a staffer asked him if Elmo would be willing to meet a young girl. The staffer then explained that the girl was terminally ill and this was her dying wish. The film includes a moving scene with a child from the Make a Wish Foundation. Elmo, we realize, transcends his fleece and stitches.

Another moving scene comes when Kevin recalls receiving an email from his daughter telling him that shell be going to university in three years and would he spend some time with her before she leaves? In that painful moment Kevin realizes how much he has sacrificed his own family flying around the world with Elmo giving joy to other children.

After watching Being Elmo I can now tell you that there is more to being Elmo than I ever realized. When he picked up that muppet Kevin didn't simply take a new job, he answered a call. And the world is glad that he did.

4951089,5,B0064NLPV0,"This was a heartwarming documentary about an unlikely success story.  Not many know of the tale of Kevin Clash nor what is behind the magic of puppeteering.  As a kid, Kevin watched one of the first episodes of Sesame Street on PBB, and instantly connected with making his own puppets and putting shows on for everyone.  Strangely enough, he jumped right from high school to New York City to work as a professional puppeteer, eventually getting his big breaks to lead him to Jim Henson and become part of the Sesame Street workshops.  He embarked on a journey that took him through Henson's most ambitious production times (bowing out of The Dark Crystal but joining for his next films), until he became part of the main group.  Following the untimely death of Jim Henson, he just happened on a fluke to bring to life what is now the most popular of the Sesame Street characters since Big Bird, Elmo.  Beloved by children and adults alike, Elmo has brought a new magic to Sesame Street that few have been able to achieve.  It's moving to see how Kevin has embraced his role as Elmo's voice and life affirming messages that Jim Henson gave to the masses.  The most tear jerking moment was all the Muppets singing for Jim's funeral about having others believe in you.

4951093,4,B0064NLPV0,"Being Elmo (Constance Marks, 2011)

I watched Being Elmo almost six months ago as I write this, in early September 2012. I'm starting this review--cheez-its knows when I'm actually going to finish it--in mid-February 2013. If you follow the vagaries of the Henson Creature Shop, just looking at those two dates will probably tell you why I found myself having to scrap every initial idea I had about how to approach reviewing this engaging, fun, just-shy-of-brilliant documentary about Kevin Clash. In case you are not a follower of same, I'll fill you in: Clash, who started working for Henson's studio in 1983, developed Elmo in 1985, and within a few years had become an integral behind-the-scenes member of Sesame Street, co-directing many of the show's episodes and morphing into one of its main producers, abruptly resigned in November 2012 amidst allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct with minors. (I'm sure I'm not the only person who immediately flashed back to Elmo's appearances on The Frugal Gourmet when I heard that.)  As I write this, the court cases are still ongoing; no idea how all this will shake out. But it's now impossible to look at Being Elmo in the same way I did in September.

I had originally planned on starting this review by mentioning how much I hate Elmo. I am a child of the seventies; I was actually born in 1968, a year and ten days before Sesame Street went on the air for the first time, and I grew up with the show. I was something of a fanatic, my mother tells me. In the early days, Sesame Street aired three times a day, and before my school career, I would be in front of the TV all three times. I can't speak to the absolute truth of this, but Netflix has a ""Sesame Street Classics"" series that collects bits from the first few years of the show, and watching it with the kid now, I remember quite a bit of that stuff despite not having seen it for more than three decades. Yeah, it made an impression. I'm also one of those people who thought the show jumped the shark the moment anyone other than Big Bird could see Snuffleupagus. Is it coincidence that happened in 1985? Couldn't tell you. In any case, back to the initial point: I can't stand the pink little horror. He's loud, he's obnoxious, his voice makes my teeth hurt. Much is made of the fact that Elmo's personality is based on Clash's in this documentary. I don't see it, and that is very, very much to the credit of the personality of Kevin Clash, who comes off here as an affable, laid-back, and (most importantly, as a contrast to Elmo) soft-spoken individual who as a child preferred interacting with puppets to interacting with people. I can identify.

I'm not the kind of person who's going to demonize Clash as a professional for things that happened in his personal life. I believe a person can be a horrid little troll personally and still be brilliant professionally. (The classic example: Richard Wagner.) I'm especially not going to do it before the jury returns whatever verdict the jury is going to end up returning. I may not be able to stand the character he created--when the kid isn't paying attention, I have been known to fast-forward through as much of ""Elmo's World"" as I can get away with--but the journey that Clash took from his lower-class Baltimore childhood (I, too, spent my early years in Baltimore; while I'm nine years younger than Clash, and so I would have probably missed the work he did there as a youngster, I knew a lot of the shows, and personalities, he and his mother talked about from the old days--a nostalgia trip indeed!) to being one of the most powerful men in public television is a fascinating one. No matter how things end up turning out, that will never change; this is the story of one guy with a dream, but who ended up having it realized way, way beyond anything his imagination could have handed him. Kevin Clash is the epitome of the American success story; if Horatio Alger were still alive, I'm pretty sure Kevin Clash would be his hero. It may no longer be possible to watch this documentary without having it weighted down by truckloads of meta, but empirically, that makes it no less inspirational. And I believe that's the first time in at least a year I've used that word without even a trace of irony or sarcasm. ****",1363564800,,4295,4.595827900912647

4951120,5,B0064NLPV0,"Looking for something to inspire you this weekend?

Why not check out ""Being Elmo"" the story about the man behind the puppet - Kevin Clash.

This documentary tells how Clash got his start into the magic of puppetry and the adults in his life who encouraged him.

I love how he told about watching puppet shows on TV (Captain Kangaroo, the Muppets and more) to figure out how the puppets were constructed, and how the puppeteers made everything work.

Clash related how he made his first puppet out of the lining of his father's trench coat. His dad loved it - but told him to ask permission first before making more.

It's amazing to think about a guy in high school making puppets - and pursuing his dream - even when classmates ridiculed him (well, until he ended up being cast on a local television show).

This documentary is inspiring. It's amazing how everything fell into place for Clash, party through the efforts of this supportive adults. No, life wasn't perfect - and he made sacrifices (good and bad) along the way to pursue his dream.

Two scenes jumped out, as I viewed the documentary.

The first one showcased a young Clash meeting legendary puppet designer Kermit Love - and being shown around Love's studio - and how Love introduced to Jim Henson.

The second shows Clash, now a Sesame Street's Senior Puppet Coordinator and Muppet Captain as well as Sesame Workshop's Senior Creative Consultant, calling and meeting with a young inspiring puppeteer.

It's almost as if Clash is paying forward, the generosity shown him as a student. I found it awesome that he not only remembers his roots, but he also helps spread his knowledge and passion to a new generation.

I've had this documentary in my Netflix queue for quite a whole. A lazy Saturday gave me an excuse to watch it. It made my morning.

On the scale of one to five, I give this a HUGE five.

I think it would be great to show students (in part) to talk about chasing dreams and finding the support needed to succeed.

It's definitely worth investing some time into watching this documentary.

4951137,4,B0064NLPV0,"Elmo is over-exposed.  It would be difficult to dispute this fact.  After decades of an amazing array of characters on Sesame Street, an often grating little red monster took center stage and never left it.  This is unfortunate.  However, over the course of this documentary (a relatively short 76 minutes), I found myself disliking Elmo less and less.  However, to say this movie made me a fan of Elmo would be a lie.  The truth is that this movie made me a fan of Kevin Clash.

The documentary tells the story of Clash's childhood, his love of puppets, his early success, his joining with Jim Henson and his rise to fame on Sesame Street.  You could not call the movie ""deep"" by any means, and those expecting any shocking revelations will be sorely disappointed, but those wanting to see a little more of the world of puppetry will be stoked at seeing rooms filled with Muppet materials, hearing stories about Jim Henson and working on the set of Labyrinth, and learning how a little red monster went from a throwaway Muppet with a caveman-like voice to a worldwide sensation.

The film does have its slightly cheesy moments.  Seeing Jim Henson edited into shots while they discuss conversations he was involved in just seemed off.  Still, I'm always happy to learn more about any conversations Henson was involved with, so despite not liking the technique used to portray it, I am happy for the things it taught me.

On any given day, I would still prefer to watch Oscar be a Grouch or Ernie get on Bert's nerves, but I would have to have a heart of stone not to have my heartstrings pulled while watching this insanely dedicated man use Elmo to bring joy into the lives of so many children.",1349481600,,1695,4.59468438538206

4951164,3,B0064NLPV0,"I thought this documentary was very well done.

That being said, what disappointed me the most was the small side story about his daughter.  He mentioned how his (ex)wife told him to put the puppet down while she was in labor with their child. I can see how having Elmo there during real life would get very old, very quickly.  The most important and saddening part of this documentary for me, was the fact that he makes a living and gets great joy from making millions of children happy, but his own daughter had to write him a letter and demand time from him.  Even her birthday cake had Elmo on it.  Was that a cake for her or him?  Being a father does not mean being absent and only coming in to throw a big party and impress her with the people you know.

He was able to realize his dreams because of supportive, loving parents that were there for him.  He did not seem do the same for his daughter.
I think we have so many problems in our society because people do not take care of their own.  If your wife/husband/child needs you, you need to find a balance between work and family.  If you decide to become a parent, your dreams may need to give way to theirs for a time.

Only living your dream and making other children happy while you neglect your own seems pretty selfish to me. I just hope watching this documentary reminded him of this and that he has since changed.",1337299200,11,1380,4.269230769230769

4951169,5,B0064NLPV0,"Like one of the earlier reviews indicated, I had no real attachment or feelings for Elmo.  To be honest I thought it was way over the top and a bit too much for me.  However, seeing Kevin Clash bring Elmo to life changed how I felt about the litte red furball, said with new affection for him.  My wife had been dying to see this documentary, and while I was able to stall for quite a while, in the end we ended up seeing it.

The story is about a young boy and his love for puppets.  It started at an early age and has continued through the ages inspite of the criticism and ridicule Kevin fased as a young boy.  It was a story about two parents, supporting their child no matter what he wanted to do.  Through hard work and dedication, Kevin was able to meet his long time idol, Kermit Love.  What was surpring, to me at least, was the way Kermit took Kevin in, showed him the tricks of the trade and supported him as Kevin grew into the puppeteer he is today.  Along the way, Kermit introduces Kevin to Jim Henson and soon Kevin was working as a puppeteer on Sesame Street.  One thing I did not know, as I had only heard Kevin's renditon of Elmo, was that there was someone before Kevin, doing the voice of Elmo.  I marvelled at how, once given the chance, Kevin took Elmo to new places and made him the loveable creature we all know today.

Kevin has gone on to bigger and better things at the studio but still does the voice of Elmo.  It is touching to see how the kids react to Elmo, even with Kevin sitting right there.  The facination with Elmo, almost makes Kevin invisible.  It is simply amazing.

If you want to see a feel good story, a real rags to riches movie, then you can't miss this one.  Like I said, I was never a big fan of Elmo, but this movie changed it for me!",1336003200,,1783,4.121739130434783

That said, one of the true gems of 2011 that few moviegoers got to see was about a puppeteer and the wildly popular character he brought to life. Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey is about as accurate as a title can be: director Constance Marks profiles one Kevin Clash, the man who grew up crafting his own puppets, dreamt of meeting Jim Henson, eventually landed a gig on Sesame Street, and reinvented a furry red muppet to become one of the most widely beloved of them all. Not surprisingly, I found the film sweet and charming, not least because Clash himself is such an endearing character, and its upbeat narrative left me feeling a little inspired. Being Elmo is a fascinating feel-good story about a man who followed his dreams without compromise and almost inadvertently created a cultural icon.",1333497600,,914,4.791139240506329

I was there primarily to support my 16 year old son who is considering a career in puppetry.  As I watched the film, I was moved by the young Mr. Clash's passion for his art and by the support of the members of the puppetry community for young, aspiring puppeteers.  What a wonderful and inspiring movie for anyone to see.  Whether you have a love for Elmo, muppets, or Sesame Street or if you really have no interest in puppets at all, this is a movie that will make you want to reach for your dreams and help your children find theirs!",1333324800,,731,4.425373134328358
4951186,4,B0064NLPV0,"The super-sweet story of Kevin Clash, the puppeteer behind Elmo and a variety of other characters, which doubles as a heartwarming look back at the attitudes and atmosphere behind the scenes with Jim Henson's troupe in the glory days. Clash is a master at his craft, a by-product of spending every afternoon since childhood with an arm inside a furry marionette, and when he's not on the air with the cast of Sesame Street, he's contentedly passing that knowledge on to the next generation. It's an attitude he inherited from Henson and his close associate Kermit Love, who took Kevin under their wing and showed him the ropes without any pretense or hesitation. Too often we're too concerned with job security to share the intimate details of our craft with others, least of all the rising young stars, but Love and Henson adopted Clash with selfless warmth and care, a lesson he hasn't forgotten and continues to roll forward to others today. They're a perfect embodiment of everything the Muppets have stood for, complete with a contagious smile that didn't leave my face for hours.",1332979200,,1085,4.870270270270271
4951187,5,B0064NLPV0,"I'm sure that many folks are running out to get DVD copies of the new Muppets film - ""The Muppets"" - and aren't even aware of the wonderful documentary which, in my opinion, makes a great ""double feature"" evening on your DVD player. (Watch ""The Muppets"" (the fictional film) first as ""Being Elmo"" will spoil some of the surprises.

But BE stands very much on it's own and the ""Bonus Features"" are well thought out by the producers of this DVD.

The 75-minute ""film"" - shot on video - follows the life of muppeteer Kevin Clash from his growing up and making his first puppet at age 10 in the poor section of Baltimore, MD to 2011, when at age 50 he has already had a 40 year career as a celebrity and both the hand inside, and voice within, of Elmo the ""I Love You"" Muppet (as well as some other characters).

As a few earlier reviews here have said, this is also a story about parenting - Kevin's mom and dad are prominently featured and their love and support are obvious. What is played down, however, is that fame and success can actually hurt a family. We see Kevin's teenage daughter only briefly and her mother is only referred to as ""my ex-wife"". But this is an uplifting film so Kevin's marriage and home life are not covered.

You may, as I did, while watching the film wonder where Director Constance Marks got the archival film footage of Kevin early in his career meeting muppeteer Kermit (yes, Kermit!) Love and Jim Henson. All this is revealed in the ""Bonus Features"".

Kevin is a very personable person and there is a lot of emotion captured by Director Marks. At least once - probably more, you will find a tear in your eye or a lump in your throat.

As I said the bonuses (33 minutes worth) truly add to the enjoyment of this package. There is a eight-minute video of the Q&A session from the Sundance Film Festival, a four-minute interview with Kevin's fellow muppeteer JohnTartaglia, who went on to star in ""Avenue Q"" and footage of Kevin and his young protge, Tau , in the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. But the 14-minute ""Some Thoughts By the Filmmakers"" is the best and uses these interviews to include important deleted scenes, while putting them in context.

This film is essential viewing for anyone who grew up with the Muppets, has children who watch Sesame Street or just loves a well-done documentary. In my book this covers nearly everyone!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Yet, the story of the man behind the muppet is both inspiring and bittersweet--as it turns out, Kevin Clash sacrificed a great deal of time with his own daughter to tour the world with Elmo and touch the lives of others.

This film made me laugh.  It brought tears to my eyes.  It taught me dozens of things about the history of modern puppeteering and other greats beyond Jim Henson, Frank Oz, and Kevin Clash.  Most of all, it filled me with gratitude for the creators and enablers of a character who has brought so much joy to the lives of so many.  I will add this to my collection and watch it again and again.",1330819200,3,712,4.315789473684211
4951191,5,B0064NLPV0,"""Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey"" is about the rise and success of Kevin Clash, Muppet Elmo's puppeteer. One of the best documentaries I have ever seen.

Clash was an unlikely puppeteer, but went at it with diligence at an early age. Confident, yet he faced the scorn of his classmates in school who questioned his ""playing with dolls."" He took risks, asked questions, and was humble throughout.

The craft of puppet making is looked at as Clash had meetings with Sesame Street's expert puppet maker Kermit Love (no relation to the frog), who took him under his wing as both a craftsman and as a professional learning show business. Also examined is how Elmo was taken from a lesser character almost removed from the show by his previous puppeteer, to being the most popular Muppet.

We meet Clash's supportive parents, his early employer who knew he had someone special, and various Sesame Street people who explain what makes Clash's work different. We see him train puppeteers for the French version of the show, help a young girl who is much like him, and Clash himself in extensive interviews.

What does this have have to do with art? Watch how lifelike Elmo is, and how deliberate every movement and vocalization is. He is not a mono-personality entity like Punch or Judy, but a complex, rich, yet specific persona. There are unexpected layers, nuance and strategic quirks. Beyond the sing-song childlike laughter, Elmo is as complete of a person as a puppet can be. Kevin Clash is the reason why.

While comparing him too much to the finer arts would be amiss, the challenge to think about the completing of our work through our audience's reception is clearly there. Clash knows who is audience is, and what he wants to communicate through his character.

My take away, as a writer, was inspiration. This may sound strange, but I felt inspired to dig into my projects the way I want to work out after watching ""Rocky.""

I fully recommend ""Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey.""

4951192,5,B0064NLPV0,"I knew nothing about this film until a friend suggested we see it after dinner one evening last year.  I knew who Elmo was (of course), but knew nothing about the actor behind him (particularily that he was African-American and not too far from my area) and his story.  I've never been so engaged with a documentary as I have than with this.  Kevin Clash's journey displayed all the characteristics of what life is all about, from the ups and downs, to the sweet satisfication of knowing what you want to do with your life, how you want to be a vessel for others, and doing what you love.  It was truly a testament of hard work and dedication, triumph and failure, and is a movie for all, in particular African-American children eager to seek a role model of a different kind.  I wasn't anticipating on shedding tears or becoming teary eyes, but I couldn't help it, particularily when Elmo makes a Make a Wish child's dreams come true, and becoming a mentor to a young child who was essentially a mirror-image of himself, bringing his whole story full circle.  Whoopi Goldberg's narration is perfect due to her ability to seemlessly walk the thin line of seriousness vs. comedy.  I was so disappointed that this didn't get the proper attention it deserved, even Academy Award recognition, but you will definitely not be disappointed with this film's heart and message of love.",1330300800,2,1376,4.6846473029045645
4951193,4,B0064NLPV0,"Being Elmo is one of those movies that I heard very little about, but was interested in immediately upon learning about it. All I knew was that it was a documentary about the puppeteer and voice actor for Elmo, which seemed like material for a good movie. Aside from short programs on tv or special features on dvds/blu-rays, you rarely get to see the people that bring the beloved characters on Sesame Street to life. Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey not only gives you the full story of how Kevin Clash got the job of reinventing Elmo, but it also shows you how passionate he is about what he does. This is a very inspiring movie that shows the old saying of 'if you dream it, you can do it' is more than just a phrase.

Since the movie is so short (just barely over an hour unless the dvd/blu-ray cut is extended), I won't talk much about the main feature and how it goes so nothing's ruined, but what you get to see is Kevin's great journey going from making a monkey puppet out of his dad's coat, to making tons of puppets and being featured on a local tv station's show, to making it big and working on Sesame Street. As soon as the old home video footage is shown of him sewing puppets and how many he's made, you can tell that this was his passion and not just a hobby. The story about Kevin's first puppet, the monkey, was charming and it's great to hear that his parents weren't exactly mad about it. Everyone interviewed here genuinely supported Kevin's love for puppets, and have many stories about good things he did for the community with them.

The movie is made up of current footage, home video footage, pictures, and interviews with Kevin's parents, former co-workers and longtime Jim Henson associates. It was a real treat getting to see Jim Henson and Frank Oz in their younger years performing with classic characters like Ernie and Bert on their arms, as well as many others who you may not have seen the faces of up until now. The current footage has Kevin showing the viewer what it's like in the workshop where puppets are assembled, and going to events where he gets to perform with Elmo. What blew my mind was seeing the first clips of Elmo on Sesame Street, where his original voice was drastically different from what we all know it as now. Who would've guessed that Elmo used to sound like a tough New York cab driver? As nice as the majority of the footage is here (don't worry, it's not sugary-sweet), there is one somewhat hard to watch scene where Kevin and Elmo meet a special child who Wished to meet Elmo. It's not a very long scene, but it got to me immediately. Fortunately, the producers of this film did it tastefully and don't try to pull at your heart's strings at all.

If you're a fan of the Muppets, grew up with Sesame Street, or just want a documentary that doesn't follow the same old formula that goes over one's rise to fame, then losing a battle with personal demons, then rise to glory again...you should definitely check this one out. The short runtime ensures that you won't get bored with anything, but at the same time, it makes me want more because I'm sure they could've featured a lot more here. Watch this one as soon as you can.",1330300800,3,3191,4.423469387755102
