It is a normal procedure for an insurance company to first investigate a claim.  Here assigns a lady adjuster.  She needs help from her friend working under
her as a private investigator.  A naked swim in his L.A. home pool means her encouragement and determination to get him hired.

Heat or Romance starts when he meets the wife beneficiary of this insured.  In the fact-finding process, he talks with local police, the insured's doctor and daughter.  Wow, there are many twists.  I don't want to spoil the fun.  Stay watching this good movie from the beginning to the end.  Beautiful scenery.  Brief nudity.  Rated ""R"".",1499817600,,754,4.834645669291339

The plot is OK, with much sex for those for whom the plot and local colour are insufficient. Worth a look at a budget price!",1345593600,,259,4.395833333333333
