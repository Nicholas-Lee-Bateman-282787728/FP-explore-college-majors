5360587,5,B009PNHSYY,"Previously on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit; A dead hooker was found in a penthouse, an old face returns and a dead hooker ends up in Captain Cragen's bed. What follows is a two-part episode conclusion and the best season opener since season 2. Raul Esparza has a recurring role as ADA Barba. The most gutsy ADA since Micheal Cutter. Also there are familiar faces that show up. Some that haven't been on for a while like Detective Cassidy and Dr. Olivet. And one familiar face from the Law & Order universe shows up for the first time on SVU. Katherine Erbe makes a guest appearance as Alex Eames who is now a Lieutenant in charge of an Anti-Terrorist Task Force. It is something a true Law & Order fan has been waiting for since Criminal Intent's debut. Some form of an SVU/CI crossover. The real-life stories that influenced the episodes were some of the biggest and tragic events that took place over this past year. Season 14 is a great season whether or not you're a fan Law & Order, SVU, Criminal Intent or just Eliot Stabler. Do not let one actor's decision not to return stop you from watching this show. If this is how good the quality got between season 13 and season 14 of SVU despite the drop to 7 million viewers, then imagine how good season 21 of Law & Order would've been. Also note that Law & Order alumnis Julie Martin and Ed Zuckerman return.",1373241600,7,1365,4.420634920634921
5360588,5,B009PNHSYY,"The show gets better and better each season. This season has some of the best acting yet, the best guest stars yet, and some of the best writing yet. The first couple episodes are serialized so if you are new to the show skip the first couple. I highly reccomend this.",1371340800,,268,4.2745098039215685
5360589,5,B009PNHSYY,"This is a fantastic show which just seems to get better all the time. Mariska and Ice T,  would have to be my favourites. In the way that they make their characters so believable. They aren't afraid to handle story lines which have depth. I am looking forward to when the next series is released on DVDs.",1368835200,,304,4.333333333333333
5360590,5,B009PNHSYY,"Y'all know me.  I love Law & Order more than my luggage, especially the Lennie Briscoe Years. And I've been an avid fan of SVU since the very first episode aired. After 14 Seasons, I'm still hooked. (Besides, Ice T looks and speaks just like my older brother, which makes me almost all sentimental.)

Law & Order: SVU may be the last of the Law & Order franchise standing, but it's definitely not the least.  The writers are pushing envelopes that are uncomfortable and scary, and the effect is thought-provoking. Season 14 gives us two of the stand-out episodes of the entire *series* -- ""Monster's Legacy"" and ""Born Psychopath.""  I'd buy the entire season on DVD for just these two episodes; but there's so much more, including.... Wait for it... Drum roll, please...The Return of Criminal Intent's Detective Eames. Oh, yeah.

SVU has always been a personality-driven series, but this year, we finally see ""behind the curtain"" and into the character's private worlds in-depth.  We're talking Solid Writing and an eye for the Real.

Law & Order: SVU Season 14 is the first and, so far, the ONLY season of SVU I've pre-ordered/owned.  I await its delivery with the same baited breath usually reserved for my amazon deliveries containing the newest season of Downton Abbey and Call of the Midwife and the almost mythical book *Nurses in Nazi Germany: The Nazi 'Euthanasia' Program.* Season 14 of SVU surpasses all my expectations. I'm telling you: It's *that* Good!",1367452800,16,1464,4.898785425101215

5360661,5,B009PNHSYY,"LAW AND ORDER SVU SEASON 14 DVD set
Lots of Great writing, Great Acting Great Directing in all 24 episodes i never got bored watching any episodes
one of the Episodes that do stand out is Born Psychopath
very chilling and Disturbing episode about a 10 year old boy who happens to show no emotion, no remorse
when he assaults his little sister and parents when he does not get his own way
by threatening them with kitchen knife or punching, kicking them
and he gets excitement out of it,
incredible performance by child actor Ethan Cutkosky who plays the 10 year old Henry
able to act with no remorse, reminds me so much of the Michael myers character in the Halloween films
who was sent to a Psychiatric hospital at the age of 10 for murdering his sister
for no logical reason
Criminal minds also has an Episode similar plot
where a 10 year old kid kills his younger brother
cause the brother was annoying the 10 year old child so much he just wanted his brother to shut up and stop crying
and he's relieved after he kills him, the whole episode shocked the hell out of me

the end scene of the episode in the Law and order TV episode
 Henry gets put in a Psychiatric hospital not prison
in his case as a 10 year old not a Juvenile centre
which i think is right, cause Henry is mentally sick in the Head and needs treatment,
and does not belong in prison
many people can argue that issue all day long

and there are more other episodes from this season that are just as well written, well acted, well Directed
i could type on and on about different episodes
but season 14 of Law and order never lets up and still gets interesting to watch with lots of suspense and thrills
still the best show on TV these days

very very unfortunate no extras at all, i thought there should be a featurette on the writers of this season
but there is nothing at all for some reason no extras

another TV show Criminal minds which i love just as much as Law and order SVU
all their dvd sets are released with making of featurettes so i don't understand why Law and order dvd sets have none
it makes no sense to me.

but season 14 law and order, still worth watching even thou there's no extras on the dvd set.",1402617600,,2190,4.252403846153846
5360662,5,B009PNHSYY,Great season lots of action and suspense. Missing Elliot but wonderful story lines- lots of drama. Great show I just hope they get Elliot back or the show will never be the same.,1399939200,,178,4.424242424242424
5360663,5,B009PNHSYY,"Law and Order SVU is my ultimate favorite TV show ever, so this is just another great DVD set for another remarkable season of suspenseful crimes being tried and convicted in the court of law. If you like a thriller and drama, then this is definitely for you. Of course if you're a huge fan it is a must buy!",1399420800,,308,4.15
5360664,5,B009PNHSYY,I love law and order been watching it for years now and it has gotten a whole lot better as well so I hope it continues to be on tv for a while.,1399248000,,144,3.393939393939394
5360665,5,B009PNHSYY,"First let me start off by saying that besides the fact that I love this show, the other reason I buy the DVD's is because I'm not able to watch the show as it airs. And Season 14 was one of the best seasons I have ever watched! The way the season ended, I can barely wait until Season 15 is on DVD.

My purchased arrived when promised, was packaged well and plays well.",1398729600,,369,3.9864864864864864

5360669,5,B009PNHSYY,"It is amazing that after so many years the writers could still get great ideas. Out of the 24 episodes, maybe one was a little boring but the others were great, good stories, good actors, and interest always awake. I loved it and as usual, watched 3 or 4 episodes back to back.",1395532800,,277,4.245283018867925

5360675,5,B009PNHSYY,I absolutely love this show and each season gets better and better.  I usually have to buy the season series because it is on at the same time as another favorite show criminal minds so I don't always get to watch all the episodes of SVU.,1389830400,,238,4.173913043478261

5360677,5,B009PNHSYY,Law and Order: SVU (which stands for special victims unit) is the best show on television. I love Detective Rowlands and ADA Refeal Barba (Raul Esparza) is sexy as hell! Who cares if he's in his early forties and I'm only twenty; that is one fine ass white man! The crimes they cover are true to life and I watch them all the time. What else is there to do when you live in a group home!? I can't wait to get season fifteen this September since I only have basic cable and the stupid FCC won't let me watch it!

5360681,5,B009PNHSYY,This may be my favorite season yet. A lot of gritty stories about male child abuse (at least three). Another cliff hanger at the end. The actor who plays BENSON keeps doing great!,1386720000,,179,4.454545454545454

5360683,3,B009PNHSYY,"By far the worst SVU season....... Especially disk 4 and then the final episode (with cliffhanger into season 15)
Just utter nonsense..........",1383782400,,143,5.545454545454546
5360684,5,B009PNHSYY,"I have seen all of them, except the ones that are currently airing this year.  I own every set for each of the 13 years and I watch them instead of movies.

The cast is outstanding and one believes he or she is living the story with them.  They are hot, meaty, with compassion and powerful involvement in the stories they tell and this is very engaging.

Mariska Hargitay is a standout and she and her fellow NYPD brothers/sisters make this show a real grit, ""this is what life is that we don't see"", show.  I don't recommend it for the squeamish because it is SVU - they deal with rape and child molesting/abduction, etc.  It is real to life, what happens that people need to know about, and it never gets old.  The writers are creative about how the stories evolve and there are only one or two out of the entire series that I found distasteful.  I recommend it if you like watching the people who fight crime - real life type of situations and the outcomes that result.",1383177600,2,972,4.331491712707182
