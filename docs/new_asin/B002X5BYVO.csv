8383489,5,B002X5BYVO,"I love this version because my favorite French actor is in the lead!
From Touchez Pas Au Grisbi, Razzia sur la chnouf,  Classe Tous Risques, or Le Deuxieme Souffle I became a big fan of Lino Ventura!

He made the best gangster, crime movies in French Cinema, in my opinion and there are few films in all of cinema that can match the aforementioned movies for quality, style and acting of all participants!.

 Also in L'arme des ombres, a terrific performance of a WWII resistance fighter with many hard decisions to make!
On a personal level this movie comes close to heart as my father was an American fighter pilot shot down over France, and the French resistance secured his eventual escape from occupied territory! So, perhaps this one movie strikes home more than any other of Ventura's!

I've been wanting to see this TV movie/film since I saw it advertised at Amazon. Fr.
I occasionally check for movies unavailable to me here in the U.S.A. And found this gem to add to my collection!

Now as for the movie; It's a 4:3 ratio as it was made for TV in 1982.
 Ventura died in 87' I believe, so this is close to one of his last works!

Personally, I like this better than any other version of Les M. because the Ventura performance is KEY to the depth of this version, as no other actor has his face or personality. He embodies Valjean as no actor has since Les miserables' have been produced! I will admit that other productions of this work have better cinematic values as the film quality here hasn't held up well from 82.  But, with a few minor TV adjustments I had a very good result.
Perhaps an inferior quality film stock was used with the idea in mind that after an initial TV debut it would be forgotten! And therefore expendable!
 I understand a Blu-ray edition is now available, so maybe the quality is much better on that release.

Fortunately for all of us it has survived in this DVD release; to be enjoyed for many years to come! I hope your experience is a good one! Au revoir!",1275091200,4,1996,4.441095890410959
