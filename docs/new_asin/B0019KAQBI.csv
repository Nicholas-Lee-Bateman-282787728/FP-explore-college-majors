8274281,5,B0019KAQBI,"After watching this documentary, I came to realize that many of these famous ""monster"" shows originated in some sort of truth. I didn't realize that reanimation studies and testing had gone back this far. In the last few decades there have been more and more movies as well as RED LETTER SECRET projects in the military as well as the private sector that have been researching this possibility. The military was working on a project back in the early to mid 1980's until it's apocalyptic ending called ""PROJECT Z.O.M.B.I.E."" that took place on an island in the Philippines. 1300 people died on that island and the survivors had to be rescued by the Delta Force. Afterwords they bombed the island.

However, this the castle Frankenstein is where it all began. I'm convinced that every scientist that tries to make this happen, ends up regretting it in the end. The dead are dead, so it's best to leave them that way. Every time that somebody tries to reanimate them, there is nothing but disaster. This documentary gets 5 stars from me.
