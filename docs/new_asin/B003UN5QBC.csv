8406070,3,B003UN5QBC,"Solstorm is a barebones suspenser that doesn't really have any shocks and its twists are such that you can probably well figure them out before the last 20 minutes.  Lovely Izabella Scorrupco is a renowned tax attorney about to leap to new heights in her firm when she's suddenly called away to her rural hometown, a snowbound, northern lights lit, conservative community where her ex, a fiery, charismatic young evangelical preacher has been found murdered with his hands chopped off in the church santuary.  Izabella's sister is prime suspect number one, having been the preacher's latest squeeze and mother of his child, and thus, is arrested upon Izabella's arrival.  It's up to the plucky amateur detective work she does on her sister's behalf that gets Izabella close to the real killer (killers)?  I won't spoil the rather routine mystery, but suffice to say, there's a mix of homophobia, rape, the umpteenth appearance Mikael Persbrandt chalks up in yet another Scandinavian film (the hardest-working Swede in show biz), and mistaken paternal identities in the formula.  Overall, it's beautiful to look at, what with the crisp snowbound scenery and cool-blue tones, the story moves along at a decent clip, and the outcome is certainly not earthshaking, but serviceably satisfactory.",1285545600,8,1290,5.21256038647343
